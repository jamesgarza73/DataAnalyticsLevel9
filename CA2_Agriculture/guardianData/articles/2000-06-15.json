That original store, on Bird Street in central London, became a byword for fashionable, good value clothes and it was quickly followed by other outlets in Liverpool, Birmingham and Sheffield. By the turn of the millennium C&amp;A had expanded across the UK and into Ireland and was operating more than 100 stores. Controlling it all along has been a reclusive Dutch dynasty. C&amp;A is named after the two founding brothers, Clemens and August, who opened their first shop in the Netherlands in 1861 and the business gradually fanned out across Europe. Members of the Brenninkmeijer family have clung to their privacy and kept their heads low. \"Openness is a sign of weakness,\" one elder was once overheard to say. Selling ready-to-wear clothing has, with the exception of the UK, been highly profitable and the family's personal fortune is estimated to exceed \u00a35bn. The Brenninkmeijers like to keep it in the family, however, and there are said to be at least 200 of them working for C&amp;A across the world. In 1997 a non-family member was brought onto the C&amp;A board in the UK for the first time and family members sit on the board in every country where C&amp;A operates. They rarely give interviews, they do not publish their financial results and they do not flaunt their wealth. They often send their children to school under assumed names and senior employees are asked to sign an oath of secrecy when they join the firm. \"There's not very much information about them and that's the problem,\" said Gerda Ackaert, a journalist at the Belgian daily De Tijd, yesterday. With headquarters in Brussels, the core family members actually run the company from a secluded compound in the Netherlands. The family comes from a strong Catholic background and is keen to be seen to be doing the right thing by its staff and customers. In normal circumstances it tries to take a \"cradle to grave\" approach to employment. Anxious to dispel the idea that the business is riddled with nepotism, the family has let it be known that young Brenninkmeijers are only given jobs if they survive a drubbing at the company's annual meeting. They go out of their way to reject suppliers offering products made using child labour and say that any of their partners exploiting their staff or the environment will have their contracts terminated immediately. Asked yesterday what the family was really like, C&amp;A's managing director Neil McCausland said: \"There seems to be a lot of myth to their so-called obsession with secrecy. They're actually very nice people.\"",

But Anglian's shares have risen by around \u00a31 on expectations that it would \"mutualise\" its core business.</p> <p>Mr Eckford acknowledged that the mutual mode raised a number of problems, including whether it struck the right balance between shareholders and customers and had the right incentives to promote efficiency.</p> <p>But the main Anglian board which has been meeting in the Czech capital for the past three days, concedes that the British regulatory and political environment is inimical to max imising earnings in water. \"We are doing a significant amount of work on this - I would be amazed if we didn't. It's not something we started yesterday.\" Mr Eckford said.</p> <p>Announcing an expansion of Anglian's interests in central Europe, he said any solution would be complex. \"We've got to re-engineer the whole structure of the company to do this and think through the consequences.\"</p> <p>The group, which saw pre-tax profits grow marginally last year but enjoyed a surge in its international business, supplies water to 1.2m people in the Czech Republic.</p> <p>Prague is to be the hub of its expansion into Poland, Germany, Slovakia and Bulgaria and Anglian is certain to bid - against French opposition from Vivendi and Lyonnaise des Eaux - for the right to privatise the bulk of the business managing water supplies for the Czech capital and its 1.2m population.</p> <p>The group, which has also set its sights on South Asia and Latin America, already owns majority stakes in two Czech water companies and this week reached a deal to acquire the bulk of the equity in another.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Anglian Water is considering following the path set by Kelda, owner of Yorkshire Water, in handing back the assets of its core water business to its 5.8m British customers, senior executives indicated yesterday. Tony Eckford, managing director of the group's international division said the mutual society proposed by Kelda, known as a registered community asset mutual (RCAM) was one of a series of options being examined by Anglian. Anglian, along with Pennon, owners of South-West Water, has been cited by analysts as a likely contender to adopt the RCAM model in order to boost its shares - and concentrate on overseas acquisitions and managing water businesses at home and abroad. Hit by strict price and environment controls, the water sector as a whole has lost 40% of its value in the past year. But Anglian's shares have risen by around \u00a31 on expectations that it would \"mutualise\" its core business. Mr Eckford acknowledged that the mutual mode raised a number of problems, including whether it struck the right balance between shareholders and customers and had the right incentives to promote efficiency. But the main Anglian board which has been meeting in the Czech capital for the past three days, concedes that the British regulatory and political environment is inimical to max imising earnings in water. \"We are doing a significant amount of work on this - I would be amazed if we didn't. It's not something we started yesterday.\" Mr Eckford said. Announcing an expansion of Anglian's interests in central Europe, he said any solution would be complex. \"We've got to re-engineer the whole structure of the company to do this and think through the consequences.\" The group, which saw pre-tax profits grow marginally last year but enjoyed a surge in its international business, supplies water to 1.2m people in the Czech Republic. Prague is to be the hub of its expansion into Poland, Germany, Slovakia and Bulgaria and Anglian is certain to bid - against French opposition from Vivendi and Lyonnaise des Eaux - for the right to privatise the bulk of the business managing water supplies for the Czech capital and its 1.2m population. The group, which has also set its sights on South Asia and Latin America, already owns majority stakes in two Czech water companies and this week reached a deal to acquire the bulk of the equity in another.",

Not, Kevin Keegan will be sorry to hear, because they have opted out of the tournament, in which England are their next opponents, but in order to present themselves at an open training session at Breinig, a village in the Ardennes, just over the border from their training centre in Holland. </p> <p>The idea was to allow the German people - and specifically several thousand people from the area around Breinig, at whose amateur club Egidius Braun, the current president of the Deutscher Fussball-Bund, cut his administrative teeth - to come and admire and applaud their representatives. In fact the session turned out to be a timely public relations exercise, since the simultaneous appearance on the same pitch of all 22 members of the Germany squad provided prima facie proof that they are not actually at one another's throats, at least in the physical sense. </p> <p>In other terms it may be a different matter. Germany, three times European champions, began this tournament by scraping a highly unsatisfactory 1-1 draw with Romania. A firestorm of criticism descended on the camp, and the familiar figure of Lothar Matth\u00e4us was at its centre. Winning his 148th cap, the 39-year-old libero had given a poor performance and was substituted after an hour, clearly exhausted. \"Lothar, get lost!\" screamed the front page of a Cologne tabloid. Paul Breitner, the Marxist who played full-back in the 1972 team, used his newspaper to campaign for an immediate switch to a 4-4-2 formation, minus Matth\u00e4us. </p> <p>But not all the criticism came from outside. Some of the players were every bit as ready to voice their disquiet. Jens Nowotny, the centre-back, demanded more responsibility, meaning that he felt he could do his job better if Matth\u00e4us were not around. Oliver Bierhoff, the captain and centre-forward, and scorer of the golden goal which won the 1996 tournament, complained - as usual - that he wasn't being served with enough crosses. Oliver Kahn, the goalkeeper, suggested that it might be a good idea to have a team meeting at which all viewpoints could be heard. </p> <p>Matth\u00e4us made a spirited response. \"If somebody can't tell me to my face what he has against me, then I feel sorry for him,\" he said. \"If no individual has the nerve, then five can come together. But there aren't that many who can put up their hand if they are asked whether they played well. I won't allow myself to be made the scapegoat.\" </p> <p>Yesterday morning Erich Ribbeck, the Germany coach, defended himself at a lengthy press conference. The day after his 63rd birthday, he began with a strikingly open admission of the poor quality of the team's performance, and of the urgent need to do something about it before Saturday's Group A meeting with England in Charleroi. </p> <p>\"We have one point while England have none,\" he declared, \"and we are aware that a draw might be enough. But the important thing is for us to show on Saturday where we really stand. It will be a game presenting the greatest challenge to everybody, and I will do my best to field a formation of players who I believe have the greatest readiness and willingness to give their all. After lunch today we will present the players with a brief video analysis of the Romania game, highlighting the defects in our performance, most of all the loss of possession, the unforced errors, the balls passed straight to the opponents' feet. Second, we will point out where and when players were seen to be unfit. We definitely need players who are willing to run and fight for as long as possible, be it 90 or 95 minutes.\" </p> <p>Did this mean that some of the players are not able to satisfy that basic requirement? \"Maybe I ought to rephrase that. But certainly against England we'll need different qualities from those we might need against other opponents. England will be tough to beat because for them it's their last chance. So we also need players who can hold their own from a physical point of view, in stature as well as stamina.\" </p> <p>Had he talked things over with Matth\u00e4us? \"Yes. I'm confident that Matth\u00e4us is able to improve. He is in a league of his own, which puts him under special pressure, but it's totally unfair to blame our failure to win on him alone. I will certainly try to help him steer a course in which he continues to be important to the team. At this stage I can't say whether it's going to be successful, but I hope and pray it will be. From a medical point of view, there is nothing wrong. He is absolutely fit. He went for a run this morning and was his old self.\" </p> <p>But was Ribbeck not showing an unreasonable degree of loyalty to a man who has, after all, spent the last three months playing for the New York-New Jersey MetroStars in the US Major Soccer League? \"If I gather from the next few training sessions the impression that he is in the same state as he was when he left the pitch on Monday, then he is not in the team. But having said that, I trust that there are plenty of objective players who will say out loud that Lothar Matth\u00e4us's training performance is excellent and that he deserves to be in the team, and that he will prove all his critics wrong. Matth\u00e4us was not the only one who failed to play the way I would love him to see him play for 90 minutes on Monday. There were other players who didn't deserve any laurels for that match.\" </p> <p>It was not true, he said, that a posse of players had come to him demanding Matth\u00e4us's removal. \"That is an invention of the media.\" But had some of them demanded changes? \"I haven't been approached with any of those wishes or requests. A number of players did voice their desire to have a clarifying discussion about the weaknesses that have been exposed and that need to be resolved. That will happen at a team meeting after the video analysis.\" </p> <p>Did all this public debate damage the team spirit? \"Let me say that the more newspapers and media are around, the harder it becomes to achieve something like a team spirit because there are 22 players and 22 interests.

      "bodyText": "Yesterday the Germans became the first team to go home from Euro 2000. Not, Kevin Keegan will be sorry to hear, because they have opted out of the tournament, in which England are their next opponents, but in order to present themselves at an open training session at Breinig, a village in the Ardennes, just over the border from their training centre in Holland. The idea was to allow the German people - and specifically several thousand people from the area around Breinig, at whose amateur club Egidius Braun, the current president of the Deutscher Fussball-Bund, cut his administrative teeth - to come and admire and applaud their representatives. In fact the session turned out to be a timely public relations exercise, since the simultaneous appearance on the same pitch of all 22 members of the Germany squad provided prima facie proof that they are not actually at one another's throats, at least in the physical sense. In other terms it may be a different matter. Germany, three times European champions, began this tournament by scraping a highly unsatisfactory 1-1 draw with Romania. A firestorm of criticism descended on the camp, and the familiar figure of Lothar Matth\u00e4us was at its centre. Winning his 148th cap, the 39-year-old libero had given a poor performance and was substituted after an hour, clearly exhausted. \"Lothar, get lost!\" screamed the front page of a Cologne tabloid. Paul Breitner, the Marxist who played full-back in the 1972 team, used his newspaper to campaign for an immediate switch to a 4-4-2 formation, minus Matth\u00e4us. But not all the criticism came from outside. Some of the players were every bit as ready to voice their disquiet.

      "trailText": "<p>Frank Kermode considers the poetry of  William Empson</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>The Complete Poems of William Empson edited by John Haffenden.</strong> <br> Allen Lane, 410 pp., \u00a330, 17 April, 0 713 99287 5 <br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,501003673,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>Empson has been dead these 16 years, and although his voice was often recorded it now seems difficult to describe it. John Haffenden says he had one voice for poetry and another for prose. Empson himself thought \"the reader should throw himself into the verse, and not do it with 'reserved' English good taste.\" The best idea was to ham it \"like a provincial Shakespeare a hundred years ago\". According to Naomi Lewis this resulted in his \"presenting his love poems in the sardonic tones of a 17th-century New England elder directing the trial of a witch\". Haffenden describes Empson's as \"a patrician voice, with a slightly sardonic timbre\", which seems a fair description of his everyday tones, and so is G.S. Fraser's - \"an odd, sad, snarly voice\". Of his poetry reading John Wain said he rendered some passages \"like a Neapolitan stevedore, laryngitically croaking others\". In private sitting-rooms he used a quieter tone, \"though the curious angularity of rhythm\", which some like and some do not, was still present. </p> <p>The first time I ever heard him read was in a private sitting-room, in about 1953, and I recall my astonishment when he read 'Note on Local Flora'. He began sedately, but at the last two lines - \"So Semele desired her deity/As this in Kew thirsts for the Red Dawn\" - he slowly rose up from his chair and delivered them in a sort of strangled apocalyptic whisper. Kathleen Raine once observed that it was just like Empson to visit Kew and read the botanical labels rather than look at the trees. There seems to be some learned dispute as to whether there is or ever was a tree that \"will ripen only in a forest fire\" in Kew Gardens. The Tree of Heaven, said in the poem to have been nearby, was blown down in the gale of 1987, and possibly the Turkestani pine suffered the same fate. Nevertheless, it seems that Kew still has specimens of which it may be possible to say that their cones cannot disperse their seeds without help from a forest fire. In any case the idea struck the poet as worthy of remark, both as calling to mind the fate of Semele, who conceived Bacchus when impregnated by Zeus in his full and fatal splendour, all thunder and lightning, and as an image of apocalypse, the fire that must burn this world. The tree thirsts for the Red Dawn, which is, as Empson himself noted, \"the Communist victory\". So it was thoughts of the glorious fate of Semele, and of the coming revolution, as well as the imminence of his own splendid epiphonema, that forced the poet out of his chair. They called for a voice different from that used (in a recording mentioned by Haffenden) in the line immediately preceding the pair I've quoted: \"I knew the Phoenix was a vegetable.\" This was delivered, we are told, humorously as if deprecating the erudite mythology of the opening lines, but was in fact a craftily deceptive lull before the final conflagration. </p> <p>A poem of ten lines demanded all this variety of tone, these ways of emphasising its plot. The plot is also an argument; most of the poems are both narrative and argument. When either or both are obscure the reason is that the terms in which each is expounded are abruptly metaphorical, and the metaphors are so far-fetched that they seem to divert the reader from the immediate sense, and the personal import of the poems. So despite the passion at the heart of the enterprise there is in the product a certain bleakness. Empson described the influence of Eliot as being \"perhaps not unlike an east wind\", and the expression may be applied to many of his own poems.</p> <p>These we can now study in Haffenden's almost wantonly magnificent edition. The poetry itself, complete except for one manuscript poem the editor wanted but the Estate withheld, occupies hardly more than a hundred pages, the commentary close to three times as many. A highly informative introduction adds another ninety or so. Haffenden's easy, expansive manner cannot quite disguise the quantity, care and detail of his work. Reading such an elaborate edition one has an uncharitable keenness to find mistakes, however slight, and editors often profess to be glad to have them pointed out. So: I think there is a mistranscription in line 10 of the interesting verses quoted on pp. xliii-xliv ('to do so' rather than 'you do so') and another in an unpublished letter on p. xlvii, where it seems likely that Empson wrote \"And I should not apologise for notes on such a scale\" rather than saying he should apologise, since on a good many other occasions he firmly declined to do so. Another slip may be explained by the editor's relative youth: he does not know what 'degaussing' means or meant. It is used in a nice little poem not by Empson but by a friend of his, to accompany a wedding present. In 1942, when the poem was written, everybody had known for a year or so that degaussing involved the fitting of a demagnetising cable round the hulls of ships to frustrate German magnetic mines; indeed OED dates the word from 1940, which is when the device was introduced. This sense, missed in Haffenden's note, is necessary to the understanding of the friend's poem and to the poet's rather beautiful response. Finally, Ulysses is misspelt on p. 328.</p> <p>Empson believed in notes. Poems (1935) and The Gathering Storm (1940) both contain defences of his practice. \"There is no longer a reasonably small field which may be taken as general knowledge. It is impertinent to suggest that the reader ought to possess already any odd piece of information one may have picked up in a field where one is oneself ignorant; and it does not require much fortitude to endure seeing what you already know in a note.\" And notes are \"meant to be like answers to a crossword puzzle... There would be no point in publishing a puzzle in a newspaper, if it were admittedly so simple that there was no need to publish the answer.\" He remarked that the craze for obscurity in poems came in about the same time as the fashion for crosswords. (Like Auden, who also wrote lots of notes when he felt like it, Empson was devoted to crossword puzzles.) However, a poem should have more than this crossword kind of interest. </p> <p>Empson was always sure that the interest of a poem arose from its representation of what passed in the mind of the poet, and the piling up of information about what the poem means is in the end an investigation of the mind that produced it. Here there is certainly a piling up of information: Empson's own notes, as included in his books of verse, further notes provided by him on records, at readings and interviews, in letters; and the thick top layer of Haffenden's elucidations. Of course, the notes can't always help much. Empson told Christopher Ricks in an interview that his poem 'The Teasers' developed in such a way that he began to dislike it; he \"cut it down to rags so that it doesn't make sense. You can't find out what it is about... But it's a beautiful metrical invention, I do say.\" Elsewhere he remarked that 'The Teasers' was 'nearly very good, above my level altogether', though with a final moral he felt the poem hadn't earned. He liked the novel effect of making a quatrain by breaking the second line of the three-line stanzas in two. As it stands it has that half-awake, dreamlike quality Empson achieved in other late poems, notably 'Let it go', said by Empson to reflect a decision to give up writing poetry:</p> <p>It is this deep blankness is the real thing<br> strange<br> The more things happen to you the more you<br> can't <br>Tell or remember even what they were.<br> The contradictions cover such a range.<br> The talk would talk and go so far aslant.<br> You don't want madhouse and the<br> whole thing there.</p> <p>This poem is printed on the back cover of this edition, and it does work as jacket copy, though Empson once said it was \"hopelessly bad\". It is worth attending to his self-judgments; he is often hard on his own work, but if he thought it deserved praise he gave it unstintedly and perceptively, as when he celebrated The Structure of Complex Words as his masterpiece. His condemnation of 'Let it go' seems to have been caused by its supposed resistance to the reader's understanding, but readers of his work are accustomed to that problem and anyway in this instance we have a kind of mumbling between sleep and wake from which simple sense is not to be expected. The last line vaguely threatens a madness brought on simply enough by the constant effort to understand, and to remain steady in the midst of, the vast system of contradictions life obliges one to contend with (a theme of earlier poems) and the deep blankness seems premonitory of that feared ending.</p> <p>Yet the poem is still a kind of muttered song, as it were composed for performance by that strange voice. Empson admired what he called 'the singing line', especially if it also had some clarity of thought. One of his most beautiful poems is 'Chinese Ballad', based on a poem by Li Chi: \"It's not by me at all, you see, but I always feel it clears the palate after a reading of my stuff.\" Ricks called the poem \"Empson's nunc dimittis as a poet\", an assurance that \"though life may be essentially inadequate to the human spirit, the human spirit is essentially adequate to life.\" The parting lovers entrust their faith to two dolls, made of mud; the dolls will be smashed and reconstituted, \"grain by grain\", </p> <p>So your flesh shall be part of mine<br> And part of mine be yours.<br> Brother and sister we shall be<br> Whose unity endures.<br> Always the sister doll will cry,<br> Made in these careful ways,<br> Cry on and on, Come back to me,<br> Come back, in a few days.</p> <p>The conceit is worthy of Donne, Empson's own chosen master, and the tone is genuinely ballad-like (as Donne's sometimes was). It is an allegory of the pain of a parting that seems perpetual, of a resistance (supported by art, by the making and mixing of the dolls) to the dreadful sense of the contradictions involved in living and thinking about it, that seems to underlie much of Empson's work, as indeed it does that of his admired Milton. The radical contradiction is between the hope of human happiness, for which, at least at certain moments, we feel ourselves so wonderfully suited, and the power of the world as it inescapably is to frustrate or even ridicule that feeling. Hence Empson's endorsement of the Buddhist position that \"no sort of temporal life whatever can satisfy the human spirit.\" Yet Buddhism also takes account of the fact that \"birth as a human being is an opportunity of inestimable value. He who is so born has at least a chance of hearing the truth and acquiring merit.\"</p> <p>It would be too crude to argue that tensions such as those touched on in 'Let it go', between the threat of madness and the requirement of sanity, can by themselves fully define the stresses within the verse, or explain why he felt he must give it up; but the effort to handle the contradictions, which attracted him to Buddhism and perhaps shaped him as a poet, may be heard even in the vagaries of that voice. </p> <p>Empson certainly thought of himself as a poet, it was his vocation; and he had a strong, I suppose ultimately a Romantic, sense of the necessary estrangement or outsidedness of poets, who may have a more urgent apprehension than others of the mismatch between desire and reality, or, simply, of the tragedy of being in the world. Graham Hough, in an obituary published in this journal, remarked that \"it is often the case that what comes across to most readers as an intricate intellectual puzzle was experienced as a painful knot of feeling,\" and the poet's friend G.S. Fraser spoke of \"puzzling form being imposed on a massive and almost unbearable personal unhappiness\". If that is the right way to talk about it, the burden on the poet who wants to communicate a full sense of what others just feel in their disordered way and, at a lower level, just put up with, is enormous. And these differences cannot be ignored; they may declare themselves not only in poems but in a manner of talking so different from other people's that admirers, not only aspiring poets but aspiring critics, are in danger of unconsciously and ridiculously imitating it. That patrician voice, colloquial, even chatty in prose, transformed for verse, highly intellectual but with none of the poses or shortcuts of ordinary intellectual talk, is an image of the spirit in which Empson could say that \"whether or not the values open to us are measurable, we cannot measure them, and it is of much value merely to stand up between the forces to which we are exposed.\" These remarks were made in the 1930s, but Haffenden says that Empson never lost his high regard for Buddhist teaching, which he often contrasted with the hateful doctrines of Christianity. The intensity with which he contemplated what might be called spiritual issues, as well as problems of personal behaviour, make it clear that although he could not easily be called a religious man or poet, he thought painfully about matters that the religious think important. </p> <p>A much-quoted remark occurs in Empson's notes to the poem 'Bacchus': \"life involves maintaining oneself between contradictions that can't be solved by analysis.\" They can only be presented with due regard for their virtually insoluble complexity. In personal life, this may call for old-fashioned virtues such as courage and honour. Honour can be forced on one; in the very obscure early poem 'High Dive' the point seems to be made that a person having got onto the high board would lose face by climbing down without diving. The poem wraps this point in more or less occult references, explained in the poet's notes, to Northern mythology, a heretical Egyptian sun-god, the fact that green coats are worn by hare hunters, Cornford's theory that the order of nature was thought of as the lifeblood of a tribe, the mathematics of water, the clotting of blood, Lucifer, Jezebel, Jonah and much else. You need to know what words like 'irrotational' mean. There is a calmly elaborate and authoritative interpretation by Veronica Forrest-Thomson in an essay quoted by the assiduous Haffenden but worth reading through in the Yearbook of English Studies for 1974. It gives one some idea of what was going on in the poet's head when he was about 22. Courage and honour may not come up in the notes, but they are there in the poem.</p> <p>The early poems are somewhat ostentatiously crammed with ideas that belong to his Cambridge youth, but some are still vigorously alive: 'To an Old Lady', for instance, and 'Camping Out' and 'Arachne', 'Legal Fiction', and the beautiful 'Villanelle' which begins \"It is the pain, it is the pain, endures.\" (Empson remarks with customary generosity on the technical superiority over his own villanelles of the one Auden wrote for Miranda in The Sea and the Mirror, which, he said, \"wipes the eye of everyone who tries to revive\" the form.) One should add to this list 'Homage to the British Museum' and 'Note on Local Flora'. </p> <p>But although the cognoscenti often find a falling off after Poems, Empson's finest are, I think, later: 'Aubade', 'Courage Means Running', 'Missing Dates' and 'Success'. He has with some justice been accused of being arrogantly awkward at times, of making matters more difficult than they need to be, but these faults, if they are faults, belong mostly to the earlier poems. There are, of course, problems even in the more lucid later work. I remember John Wain, who adored Empson, joking about the evident difficulty the poet had in keeping up the rhymes in 'Missing Dates':</p> <p>Slowly the poison the whole blood stream<br> fills.<br> It is not the effort nor the failure tires.<br> The waste remains, the waste remains and<br> kills.</p> <p>All is well, the rhyming holds up till we get to \"They bled an old dog dry yet the exchange rills/ Of young dog blood gave but a month's desires', and later there is 'a skin that shrills\"; but the villanelle is still beautiful. So with 'Success': the opening is certainly arresting (\"I have mislaid the torment and the fear./You should be praised for taking them away\") but a few lines later \"Verse likes despair. Blame it on the beer\", sounds a bit desperate. Still, it may catch the mood of its writing as Empson describes it: \"It's recovering from a love affair and saying it did you good.\" His view of love was that it saves you from madness. </p> <p>Wain says of 'Aubade' that it \"really happened\", the poet and a Japanese girl (apparently a nursemaid) are caught in bed by an earthquake. \"'The heart of standing is you cannot fly', one of Empson's great reverberating lines... covers a wide range: the whole point of turning to fight is that running away will not save them and is in any case contrary to their code.\" That seems right - the last line changes 'you' to 'we' - even when balanced against 'It seemed the best thing to be up and go.' The poem enshrines contradiction, and even that reverberant line, with its patrician sentiment, has a patrician deviance from ordinary ways of speaking. What makes it reverberant is the voice, an excitement proper to the speaker. When Empson rose slowly from his seat to match the expectations of the tree in Kew he was still, after more than twenty years, thrilled by the prospect of the poem's climax. It celebrated a victory, you rose to meet it, as you took the high dive and dealt with the earthquake in a structured, moody form that was itself a challenge issued by poetry to the poet.</p> <p>\u0095 To read more online essays from the current edition of the London Review of Books visit the <a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk\">LRB</a>.

      "bodyText": "The Complete Poems of William Empson edited by John Haffenden. Allen Lane, 410 pp., \u00a330, 17 April, 0 713 99287 5 Buy it at BOL Empson has been dead these 16 years, and although his voice was often recorded it now seems difficult to describe it. John Haffenden says he had one voice for poetry and another for prose. Empson himself thought \"the reader should throw himself into the verse, and not do it with 'reserved' English good taste.\" The best idea was to ham it \"like a provincial Shakespeare a hundred years ago\". According to Naomi Lewis this resulted in his \"presenting his love poems in the sardonic tones of a 17th-century New England elder directing the trial of a witch\". Haffenden describes Empson's as \"a patrician voice, with a slightly sardonic timbre\", which seems a fair description of his everyday tones, and so is G.S. Fraser's - \"an odd, sad, snarly voice\". Of his poetry reading John Wain said he rendered some passages \"like a Neapolitan stevedore, laryngitically croaking others\". In private sitting-rooms he used a quieter tone, \"though the curious angularity of rhythm\", which some like and some do not, was still present. The first time I ever heard him read was in a private sitting-room, in about 1953, and I recall my astonishment when he read 'Note on Local Flora'. He began sedately, but at the last two lines - \"So Semele desired her deity/As this in Kew thirsts for the Red Dawn\" - he slowly rose up from his chair and delivered them in a sort of strangled apocalyptic whisper. Kathleen Raine once observed that it was just like Empson to visit Kew and read the botanical labels rather than look at the trees. There seems to be some learned dispute as to whether there is or ever was a tree that \"will ripen only in a forest fire\" in Kew Gardens. The Tree of Heaven, said in the poem to have been nearby, was blown down in the gale of 1987, and possibly the Turkestani pine suffered the same fate. Nevertheless, it seems that Kew still has specimens of which it may be possible to say that their cones cannot disperse their seeds without help from a forest fire. In any case the idea struck the poet as worthy of remark, both as calling to mind the fate of Semele, who conceived Bacchus when impregnated by Zeus in his full and fatal splendour, all thunder and lightning, and as an image of apocalypse, the fire that must burn this world. The tree thirsts for the Red Dawn, which is, as Empson himself noted, \"the Communist victory\". So it was thoughts of the glorious fate of Semele, and of the coming revolution, as well as the imminence of his own splendid epiphonema, that forced the poet out of his chair. They called for a voice different from that used (in a recording mentioned by Haffenden) in the line immediately preceding the pair I've quoted: \"I knew the Phoenix was a vegetable.\" This was delivered, we are told, humorously as if deprecating the erudite mythology of the opening lines, but was in fact a craftily deceptive lull before the final conflagration. A poem of ten lines demanded all this variety of tone, these ways of emphasising its plot. The plot is also an argument; most of the poems are both narrative and argument. When either or both are obscure the reason is that the terms in which each is expounded are abruptly metaphorical, and the metaphors are so far-fetched that they seem to divert the reader from the immediate sense, and the personal import of the poems. So despite the passion at the heart of the enterprise there is in the product a certain bleakness. Empson described the influence of Eliot as being \"perhaps not unlike an east wind\", and the expression may be applied to many of his own poems. These we can now study in Haffenden's almost wantonly magnificent edition. The poetry itself, complete except for one manuscript poem the editor wanted but the Estate withheld, occupies hardly more than a hundred pages, the commentary close to three times as many. A highly informative introduction adds another ninety or so. Haffenden's easy, expansive manner cannot quite disguise the quantity, care and detail of his work. Reading such an elaborate edition one has an uncharitable keenness to find mistakes, however slight, and editors often profess to be glad to have them pointed out. So: I think there is a mistranscription in line 10 of the interesting verses quoted on pp. xliii-xliv ('to do so' rather than 'you do so') and another in an unpublished letter on p. xlvii, where it seems likely that Empson wrote \"And I should not apologise for notes on such a scale\" rather than saying he should apologise, since on a good many other occasions he firmly declined to do so. Another slip may be explained by the editor's relative youth: he does not know what 'degaussing' means or meant. It is used in a nice little poem not by Empson but by a friend of his, to accompany a wedding present. In 1942, when the poem was written, everybody had known for a year or so that degaussing involved the fitting of a demagnetising cable round the hulls of ships to frustrate German magnetic mines; indeed OED dates the word from 1940, which is when the device was introduced. This sense, missed in Haffenden's note, is necessary to the understanding of the friend's poem and to the poet's rather beautiful response. Finally, Ulysses is misspelt on p. 328. Empson believed in notes. Poems (1935) and The Gathering Storm (1940) both contain defences of his practice. \"There is no longer a reasonably small field which may be taken as general knowledge. It is impertinent to suggest that the reader ought to possess already any odd piece of information one may have picked up in a field where one is oneself ignorant; and it does not require much fortitude to endure seeing what you already know in a note.\" And notes are \"meant to be like answers to a crossword puzzle... There would be no point in publishing a puzzle in a newspaper, if it were admittedly so simple that there was no need to publish the answer.\" He remarked that the craze for obscurity in poems came in about the same time as the fashion for crosswords. (Like Auden, who also wrote lots of notes when he felt like it, Empson was devoted to crossword puzzles.) However, a poem should have more than this crossword kind of interest. Empson was always sure that the interest of a poem arose from its representation of what passed in the mind of the poet, and the piling up of information about what the poem means is in the end an investigation of the mind that produced it. Here there is certainly a piling up of information: Empson's own notes, as included in his books of verse, further notes provided by him on records, at readings and interviews, in letters; and the thick top layer of Haffenden's elucidations. Of course, the notes can't always help much. Empson told Christopher Ricks in an interview that his poem 'The Teasers' developed in such a way that he began to dislike it; he \"cut it down to rags so that it doesn't make sense. You can't find out what it is about... But it's a beautiful metrical invention, I do say.\" Elsewhere he remarked that 'The Teasers' was 'nearly very good, above my level altogether', though with a final moral he felt the poem hadn't earned. He liked the novel effect of making a quatrain by breaking the second line of the three-line stanzas in two. As it stands it has that half-awake, dreamlike quality Empson achieved in other late poems, notably 'Let it go', said by Empson to reflect a decision to give up writing poetry: It is this deep blankness is the real thing strange The more things happen to you the more you can't Tell or remember even what they were. The contradictions cover such a range. The talk would talk and go so far aslant. You don't want madhouse and the whole thing there. This poem is printed on the back cover of this edition, and it does work as jacket copy, though Empson once said it was \"hopelessly bad\". It is worth attending to his self-judgments; he is often hard on his own work, but if he thought it deserved praise he gave it unstintedly and perceptively, as when he celebrated The Structure of Complex Words as his masterpiece. His condemnation of 'Let it go' seems to have been caused by its supposed resistance to the reader's understanding, but readers of his work are accustomed to that problem and anyway in this instance we have a kind of mumbling between sleep and wake from which simple sense is not to be expected. The last line vaguely threatens a madness brought on simply enough by the constant effort to understand, and to remain steady in the midst of, the vast system of contradictions life obliges one to contend with (a theme of earlier poems) and the deep blankness seems premonitory of that feared ending. Yet the poem is still a kind of muttered song, as it were composed for performance by that strange voice. Empson admired what he called 'the singing line', especially if it also had some clarity of thought. One of his most beautiful poems is 'Chinese Ballad', based on a poem by Li Chi: \"It's not by me at all, you see, but I always feel it clears the palate after a reading of my stuff.\" Ricks called the poem \"Empson's nunc dimittis as a poet\", an assurance that \"though life may be essentially inadequate to the human spirit, the human spirit is essentially adequate to life.\" The parting lovers entrust their faith to two dolls, made of mud; the dolls will be smashed and reconstituted, \"grain by grain\", So your flesh shall be part of mine And part of mine be yours. Brother and sister we shall be Whose unity endures. Always the sister doll will cry, Made in these careful ways, Cry on and on, Come back to me, Come back, in a few days. The conceit is worthy of Donne, Empson's own chosen master, and the tone is genuinely ballad-like (as Donne's sometimes was). It is an allegory of the pain of a parting that seems perpetual, of a resistance (supported by art, by the making and mixing of the dolls) to the dreadful sense of the contradictions involved in living and thinking about it, that seems to underlie much of Empson's work, as indeed it does that of his admired Milton. The radical contradiction is between the hope of human happiness, for which, at least at certain moments, we feel ourselves so wonderfully suited, and the power of the world as it inescapably is to frustrate or even ridicule that feeling. Hence Empson's endorsement of the Buddhist position that \"no sort of temporal life whatever can satisfy the human spirit.\" Yet Buddhism also takes account of the fact that \"birth as a human being is an opportunity of inestimable value. He who is so born has at least a chance of hearing the truth and acquiring merit.\" It would be too crude to argue that tensions such as those touched on in 'Let it go', between the threat of madness and the requirement of sanity, can by themselves fully define the stresses within the verse, or explain why he felt he must give it up; but the effort to handle the contradictions, which attracted him to Buddhism and perhaps shaped him as a poet, may be heard even in the vagaries of that voice. Empson certainly thought of himself as a poet, it was his vocation; and he had a strong, I suppose ultimately a Romantic, sense of the necessary estrangement or outsidedness of poets, who may have a more urgent apprehension than others of the mismatch between desire and reality, or, simply, of the tragedy of being in the world. Graham Hough, in an obituary published in this journal, remarked that \"it is often the case that what comes across to most readers as an intricate intellectual puzzle was experienced as a painful knot of feeling,\" and the poet's friend G.S. Fraser spoke of \"puzzling form being imposed on a massive and almost unbearable personal unhappiness\". If that is the right way to talk about it, the burden on the poet who wants to communicate a full sense of what others just feel in their disordered way and, at a lower level, just put up with, is enormous. And these differences cannot be ignored; they may declare themselves not only in poems but in a manner of talking so different from other people's that admirers, not only aspiring poets but aspiring critics, are in danger of unconsciously and ridiculously imitating it. That patrician voice, colloquial, even chatty in prose, transformed for verse, highly intellectual but with none of the poses or shortcuts of ordinary intellectual talk, is an image of the spirit in which Empson could say that \"whether or not the values open to us are measurable, we cannot measure them, and it is of much value merely to stand up between the forces to which we are exposed.\" These remarks were made in the 1930s, but Haffenden says that Empson never lost his high regard for Buddhist teaching, which he often contrasted with the hateful doctrines of Christianity.

A much-quoted remark occurs in Empson's notes to the poem 'Bacchus': \"life involves maintaining oneself between contradictions that can't be solved by analysis.\" They can only be presented with due regard for their virtually insoluble complexity. In personal life, this may call for old-fashioned virtues such as courage and honour. Honour can be forced on one; in the very obscure early poem 'High Dive' the point seems to be made that a person having got onto the high board would lose face by climbing down without diving. The poem wraps this point in more or less occult references, explained in the poet's notes, to Northern mythology, a heretical Egyptian sun-god, the fact that green coats are worn by hare hunters, Cornford's theory that the order of nature was thought of as the lifeblood of a tribe, the mathematics of water, the clotting of blood, Lucifer, Jezebel, Jonah and much else. You need to know what words like 'irrotational' mean. There is a calmly elaborate and authoritative interpretation by Veronica Forrest-Thomson in an essay quoted by the assiduous Haffenden but worth reading through in the Yearbook of English Studies for 1974. It gives one some idea of what was going on in the poet's head when he was about 22. Courage and honour may not come up in the notes, but they are there in the poem.

One should add to this list 'Homage to the British Museum' and 'Note on Local Flora'. But although the cognoscenti often find a falling off after Poems, Empson's finest are, I think, later: 'Aubade', 'Courage Means Running', 'Missing Dates' and 'Success'. He has with some justice been accused of being arrogantly awkward at times, of making matters more difficult than they need to be, but these faults, if they are faults, belong mostly to the earlier poems. There are, of course, problems even in the more lucid later work. I remember John Wain, who adored Empson, joking about the evident difficulty the poet had in keeping up the rhymes in 'Missing Dates': Slowly the poison the whole blood stream fills. It is not the effort nor the failure tires. The waste remains, the waste remains and kills. All is well, the rhyming holds up till we get to \"They bled an old dog dry yet the exchange rills/ Of young dog blood gave but a month's desires', and later there is 'a skin that shrills\"; but the villanelle is still beautiful. So with 'Success': the opening is certainly arresting (\"I have mislaid the torment and the fear./You should be praised for taking them away\") but a few lines later \"Verse likes despair. Blame it on the beer\", sounds a bit desperate. Still, it may catch the mood of its writing as Empson describes it: \"It's recovering from a love affair and saying it did you good.\" His view of love was that it saves you from madness. Wain says of 'Aubade' that it \"really happened\", the poet and a Japanese girl (apparently a nursemaid) are caught in bed by an earthquake. \"'The heart of standing is you cannot fly', one of Empson's great reverberating lines... covers a wide range: the whole point of turning to fight is that running away will not save them and is in any case contrary to their code.\" That seems right - the last line changes 'you' to 'we' - even when balanced against 'It seemed the best thing to be up and go.'

Standard rate tuition fees were introduced in 1997, just after the general election, with no manifesto mandate. On the one occasion the electorate has had to vote on the issue - the Scottish Parliament election in 1999 - it voted to reject fees. If the government really wants to improve access to education then it should listen to the independent Cubie inquiry; rule out top-up fees and introduce targeted maintenance grants. Undoubtedly, universities remain under-funded. The NUS suggests that the best way to increase the flow of funds into universities is via a regulated business contribution to solve the funding gap. Currently, business is the stakeholder group which contributes the least to higher education but benefits the most. Students need well-resourced lecturers, just as lecturers need properly funded students. Lecturers who are poorly motivated by discriminatory pay or students who are distracted from their studies by part-time jobs, or forced to drop out through hardship, are of no credit to higher education. Education in the 21st century must be based on equal access for students and fairness at work for lecturers.",

      "body": "<p><strong>STATEMENT BY WESSEL JOHANNES CRONJE </strong></p> <p>I, the undersigned, Wessel Johannes Cronje, do hereby state that: </p> <p>1. I have been a full-time professional cricketer since 1988. I was a member of the South African cricket side from 1992 until the 11th of April 2000. I captained the South African team from the third Test of the Australian series in 1994 until the 11th of April 2000. I played in a total of 68 Test matches, 53 of which as captain. I also represented South Africa in 188 one-day internationals, 138 of those as captain. Ninety-nine of the one-day internationals under my captaincy were victories. </p> <p>2. It is time for me to try to repay a part of the enormous debt which I owe to cricket and to try to repair some of the damage which I have caused the game, South Africa, my family and team-mates, and the cricketing public. </p> <p>3. My initial denials of involvement made publicly and to the UCB, were untruthful; my letter of the 11th April was also untruthful in a number of respects; and so too was the subsequent press statement issued on my instructions. I misled the United Cricket Board of South Africa and members of the South African government and those who tried to defend me. I also withheld facts from my legal representatives. I was not honest and I apologise unreservedly, </p> <p>4. I have also decided to sever my connections with the game and I will not again play cricket at representative level. </p> <p>5. Words cannot begin to describe the shame, humiliation and pain I feel, in the knowledge that I have afflicted this on others. To my wife, family, and team-mates, in particular, I apologise. </p> <p>6. The greatest honour which can be bestowed upon any cricketer is to lead his country's national side. I have failed in my moral and professional duties. Hopefully, I can contribute some small measure of redress by placing before the commission the information which follows in this statement. Until now I have not named or implicated any other person, and I fear that the revelations in this statement create serious implications for my personal safety. I have already received death threats. </p> <p>7. I wish to disclose all the information I have and, in the emotional state in which I find myself, have dredged my memory as best I can in order to place the facts before this commission. </p> <p>8. Since the first revelations made in the Indian press and, in particular, the morning of 11 April of this year, I have known that my days as a cricketer are over. There were, however others - namely Herschelle Gibbs, Pieter Strydom and Henry Williams - who have their playing careers before them and whose futures have been imperilled by my inexcusable actions. Foolishly, I tried to suppress disclosure of their involvement and, in doing so, encouraged Herschelle Gibbs and Henry Williams to conceal their role. I hoped to save them from their predicament in which I had placed them: instead I compromised them and worsened their position. It would be a tragedy if any of these players were to be lost to South African cricket because of my wrongdoing. I beg the Commission and the cricketing authorities not to deprive the game of their talents and beg the UCB to reinstate both Herschelle and Henry to the National Squad. Herschelle lied to the UCB, his employer, at my request. Herschelle, forgive me. </p> <p>9. I will attempt to deal with the matters which form the subject of this Commission's terms of reference in chronological order and not in the order in which they appear in the terms of reference. Before doing so, however, I would like to deal with an approach I received to influence the result of the first One-Day international against Pakistan in the Mandela Trophy in January 1995. Pay Symcox mistakenly said, in his evidence before the Commission, that this occurred in 1997. </p> <p><strong>THE MANDELA CUP IN 1995</strong></p> <p>10. Shortly before the first One-Day international final against Pakistan in the Mandela Cup in Cape Town in January 1995 I was approached by an Indian or Pakistani man, who described himself only as \"John\" (I believe he may be the individual of the same name who was referred to by Shane Warne and Mark Waugh during their hearings before the Australian Cricket Board). He offered an amount, I think about US10000.00 for the team to throw the game. I subsequently discussed this with Pat Symcox. We agreed we should not even put it to the team, and that was the end of the matter. I did not approach any other players. In the event, we won that match. </p> <p>11. I recall that when I walked onto the field for the match, I was asked by Salim Malik whether I had spoken to John. It was evident to me that he knew about the approach I had received. I felt ashamed and embarrassed and, wishing to avoid even talking about the matter, merely nodded. </p> <p>12. Before the second One-Day final in Johannesburg I was again contacted by John who asked if anything could be done in respect of the second game. I told him I was not interested. We also won that game. I never spoke to him again. </p> <p>13. I subsequently heard rumours that Pakistani players had been involved in match-fixing during the Mandela Cup, and in Zimbabwe in 1995. South Africa had not been. </p> <p><strong>THE SOUTH AFRICAN TOUR TO INDIA IN 1996</strong> </p> <p>14. During our tour in Pakistan in 1994, Kepler Wessels told me that he knew of offers which had been made to Australian cricketers, I do not know whom, to lose a Test match in Karachi. </p> <p>15. At some stage during the 1996 Indian tour -- I cannot recall when -- I was also approached by someone known to me as \"Sunil.\" he had befriended some members of the team earlier that year during the Sharjah Cup. Sunil asked me if I was interested in fixing matches. I said I was not. No offers or financial proposals were received from him. </p> <p>16. On the evening of the third day of the third Test against India at Kanpur I received a call from Mohamed Azharuddin, who was friendly with a number of South African players. He called me to a room in the hotel and introduced me to Mukesh Gupta (\"MK\"). Azharuddin then departed and left us alone in the room. MK asked if we would give wickets away on the last day of that Test to ensure that we lost. He asked me to speak to the other players and gave me approximately US30000 in cash to do so. I led him to believe that I would. This seemed an easy way to make money but I had no intention of doing anything. I did not speak to any of the other players and did nothing to influence the match. In the event, however, we lost the Test. I had effectively received money for doing nothing and I rationalised to myself that this was somehow acceptable because I had not actually done anything. </p> <p>17. Before the final One-Day international MK asked me to speak to the players about throwing the game, which I agreed to do. By that stage we were exhausted, it was the end of a long and arduous tour, and a number of key players were suffering from injuries. MK asked me to convey an offer of US200000 to the team to throw the match. It was a long time ago and I cannot recall the exact sequence of events, but as far as I can recall, it was as follows: </p> <p>17.1 I spoke to some of the players beforehand, advising that a team meeting would be called to consider the offer. </p> <p>17.2 A team meeting was held the evening before the match, attended by all the players in the squad. I conveyed the offer to the team, which rejected it. I recall, in particular, that Andrew Hudson, Daryll Cullinan and Derrick Crookes spoke out strongly against it. It was agreed that the decision had to be unanimous or not at all. </p> <p>17.3 After the meeting a few players remained and we chatted about the matter. We were curious to see whether the offer could be increased. I telephoned MK and told him the team was not interested but asked whether he was prepared to increase his offer to US300000. He replied that this was too much but that he would increase it to US250000. </p> <p>17.4 The next morning before the match, there was a very brief meeting at which it was confirmed that the offer was rejected When Mr Woolmer, the coach, heard about the offer and he was very angry about it. He was later quoted in the media about this offer and its rejection. </p> <p>18. I then telephoned MK and told him that the offer was rejected. No money passed hands. I did however tell him that the team was sub-standard because of the number of injured players. I received no benefit or offer of payment for this information.</p>",

Or simply arm Alan Hansen and Mark Lawrenson with hi-tech weaponry and set them on head of ITV sport, David Liddiment?

Send your thoughts to <a href=\"mailto:the.boss@theguardian.com\">the.boss@theguardian.com</a></p> <p><strong>HANG ON IN THERE</strong></p> <p>After bamboozling Fleet Street's finest at yesterday's press conference by sending out Phil Neal clone Les Reed instead of himself, Kelvin Koogan returned in fighting mood today. \"We took a bit of a blow and have taken the eight count as a boxer would,\" he admitted while Eye of the Tiger stirred heroically in the background. \"But we will come back punching.\" However, before the assembled journalists could put their lacquered bouffants together to work out which middle-European country was in a line for a mauling, Koogan suddenly blurted out: \"I am not thinking of the Germans. I am more thinking of building ourselves up.\"</p> <p>Five seconds passed. There was a stunned silence. Then a reporter asked him his thoughts on this country called Germany. Koogan's resistance shattered. \"We know what Germany are about, they know what we are about,\" he admitted, failing in any attempt at big-boy mind games. \"Our homework has been done properly,\" he said, warming to the German theme. \"We know what their weaknesses and strengths are. This is a big game but it was always going to be a big game.\" </p> <p>Under the gentlest of interrogations (\"It's a really important game isn't it, Kev?\") Koogan went on. \"It means everything,\" he revealed. \"We need a result. We will be doing everything we can to beat the Germans. But we also know and respect the fact that this is not easy.\" Koogan insists that despite Monday's result, it isn't all doom and gloom in the England camp. \"We played some good stuff against Portugal,\" he said this afternoon. \"We showed a lot of determination when a lot of other teams would have laid down. Although we're disappointed with the result there were things to hang onto as a coach.\" Like a noose and the nearest tree, perhaps?</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"The deal is good news for the Premier League, but the same cannot be said for the rest of the league system. It will tend to be the same three going up and down all the time and the longer clubs attract money by being in the Premier League the more entrenched their position becomes\" - Football analyst Paul Wedge puts a cheery spin on life under the new TV deal.</p> <p><strong>GOOD PR WITH GEORGE GRAHAM</strong></p> <p>Hi! I'm Arsenal's George Graham, manager of Tottenham Hotspur. People often ask me how I've managed to become so popular with the regulars at Hig... er, White Hart Lane. Well, let me tell you. Firstly, I won over their trust by emerging victorious from the classic 1999 Worthington Cup final, wiping out with one stroke the memory of all the trophies I won for Arsenal (ah, halcyon days). Secondly, they know my teams are honest and hard-working in the true Tottenham tradition. Which, by the way, is why I've accepted a \u00a33m bid from Aston Villa for peripheral wingman David Ginola.</p> <p>That's the sort of decisive action the fans love, you see. I mean, there's no way somebody like supporters' spokesman Mark Jacob would say anything like \"the thought of our only creative player leaving us fills us with dread\" or \"all our fears are coming home to roost\". No, because our fans know what I'm about. And I'm about success. Which is why I'm not expecting people like Mark to make comments like \"just when Tottenham fans were beginning to get excited following the signing of Sergei Rebrov, our hopes get dashed\".</p> <p>In any case, there's nothing I can do about it now, because even if Ginola doesn't want to sign for Villa, he'll not want to play for us again now I've made it clear he's not part of my plans. Ah well. Plenty of other clubs will want him I'm sure. Anyway, if he's really struggling for work, I know of a few supermarkets on the lookout for surly workshy individuals with unkempt hair who don't like taking orders from their boss.</p> <p><strong>THE RUMOUR MILL</strong></p> <p>Spurs are already looking at a possible replacement for David Ginola. Barcelona's Dutch winger Boudewijn Zenden is expected to be one of several Dutchmen to leave the Nou Camp this summer, and Spurs are ready with a \u00a34m bid.</p> <p>Arsenal have been linked with a deal for Sweden's lanky striker Kennet Andersson. Andersson, who is now 32, currently plays for Bologna in Serie A and would cost in the region of \u00a32m.</p> <p>Scottish starlet Kenny Miller could be set for a move to Rangers. \"If Hibs decided to sell Kenny, and personal terms could be agreed, then Rangers are a club that Kenny would consider going to,\" his agent, Gordon Smith, said today.</p> <p>Newcastle are expected to complete the signing of Argentine striker Carlos Daniel Cordone this weekend for \u00a3500,000.</p> <p>Carlisle are interested in signing Kilmarnock striker Ally McCoist.</p> <p><strong>NEWS IN BRIEF</strong></p> <p>Lothar Matthaus will start for Germany against England on Saturday. \"I hope Lothar will show what he can really do,\" coach Erich Ribbeck told German TV. The news follows the revelation that Matthaus had offered his resignation after the Romania game. \"I offered my resignation to the manager and told him that this would be the best solution if I was a burden to the side,\" the 39-year-old legend explained to German magazine Kicker. But Ribbeck turned down his request, saying: \"We will pull through this together. You helped me, I will not let you fall.\"</p> <p>Speculation is mounting that Martin Edwards is to step down as chief executive of Manchester United. But the club insist that no board reshuffle has been decided on yet.</p> <p>Sheffield Wednesday chairman Howard Culley has survived a vote of no-confidence.</p> <p><strong>TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO</strong></p> <p>BBC1: A Question of Sport Special (7pm)</p> <p>Not that good, but it's not They Think It's All Over so it's got something going for it.</p> <p>ITV: Euro 2000 - Live (7.30pm)</p> <p>Have a rummage through the big pile of pizza boxes and empty cans of cheap lager in your front room.

Or simply arm Alan Hansen and Mark Lawrenson with hi-tech weaponry and set them on head of ITV sport, David Liddiment? We have a dream... Do you have any clue about how to save the only piece of intelligent football programming on telly? Or do you just want to offer Alan a job? Send your thoughts to the.boss@theguardian.com HANG ON IN THERE After bamboozling Fleet Street's finest at yesterday's press conference by sending out Phil Neal clone Les Reed instead of himself, Kelvin Koogan returned in fighting mood today. \"We took a bit of a blow and have taken the eight count as a boxer would,\" he admitted while Eye of the Tiger stirred heroically in the background. \"But we will come back punching.\" However, before the assembled journalists could put their lacquered bouffants together to work out which middle-European country was in a line for a mauling, Koogan suddenly blurted out: \"I am not thinking of the Germans. I am more thinking of building ourselves up.\" Five seconds passed. There was a stunned silence. Then a reporter asked him his thoughts on this country called Germany. Koogan's resistance shattered. \"We know what Germany are about, they know what we are about,\" he admitted, failing in any attempt at big-boy mind games. \"Our homework has been done properly,\" he said, warming to the German theme. \"We know what their weaknesses and strengths are. This is a big game but it was always going to be a big game.\" Under the gentlest of interrogations (\"It's a really important game isn't it, Kev?\") Koogan went on. \"It means everything,\" he revealed. \"We need a result. We will be doing everything we can to beat the Germans. But we also know and respect the fact that this is not easy.\" Koogan insists that despite Monday's result, it isn't all doom and gloom in the England camp. \"We played some good stuff against Portugal,\" he said this afternoon. \"We showed a lot of determination when a lot of other teams would have laid down. Although we're disappointed with the result there were things to hang onto as a coach.\" Like a noose and the nearest tree, perhaps? QUOTE OF THE DAY \"The deal is good news for the Premier League, but the same cannot be said for the rest of the league system. It will tend to be the same three going up and down all the time and the longer clubs attract money by being in the Premier League the more entrenched their position becomes\" - Football analyst Paul Wedge puts a cheery spin on life under the new TV deal. GOOD PR WITH GEORGE GRAHAM Hi! I'm Arsenal's George Graham, manager of Tottenham Hotspur. People often ask me how I've managed to become so popular with the regulars at Hig... er, White Hart Lane. Well, let me tell you. Firstly, I won over their trust by emerging victorious from the classic 1999 Worthington Cup final, wiping out with one stroke the memory of all the trophies I won for Arsenal (ah, halcyon days). Secondly, they know my teams are honest and hard-working in the true Tottenham tradition. Which, by the way, is why I've accepted a \u00a33m bid from Aston Villa for peripheral wingman David Ginola. That's the sort of decisive action the fans love, you see. I mean, there's no way somebody like supporters' spokesman Mark Jacob would say anything like \"the thought of our only creative player leaving us fills us with dread\" or \"all our fears are coming home to roost\". No, because our fans know what I'm about. And I'm about success. Which is why I'm not expecting people like Mark to make comments like \"just when Tottenham fans were beginning to get excited following the signing of Sergei Rebrov, our hopes get dashed\". In any case, there's nothing I can do about it now, because even if Ginola doesn't want to sign for Villa, he'll not want to play for us again now I've made it clear he's not part of my plans. Ah well. Plenty of other clubs will want him I'm sure. Anyway, if he's really struggling for work, I know of a few supermarkets on the lookout for surly workshy individuals with unkempt hair who don't like taking orders from their boss. THE RUMOUR MILL Spurs are already looking at a possible replacement for David Ginola. Barcelona's Dutch winger Boudewijn Zenden is expected to be one of several Dutchmen to leave the Nou Camp this summer, and Spurs are ready with a \u00a34m bid. Arsenal have been linked with a deal for Sweden's lanky striker Kennet Andersson. Andersson, who is now 32, currently plays for Bologna in Serie A and would cost in the region of \u00a32m. Scottish starlet Kenny Miller could be set for a move to Rangers. \"If Hibs decided to sell Kenny, and personal terms could be agreed, then Rangers are a club that Kenny would consider going to,\" his agent, Gordon Smith, said today. Newcastle are expected to complete the signing of Argentine striker Carlos Daniel Cordone this weekend for \u00a3500,000. Carlisle are interested in signing Kilmarnock striker Ally McCoist. NEWS IN BRIEF Lothar Matthaus will start for Germany against England on Saturday. \"I hope Lothar will show what he can really do,\" coach Erich Ribbeck told German TV. The news follows the revelation that Matthaus had offered his resignation after the Romania game. \"I offered my resignation to the manager and told him that this would be the best solution if I was a burden to the side,\" the 39-year-old legend explained to German magazine Kicker. But Ribbeck turned down his request, saying: \"We will pull through this together. You helped me, I will not let you fall.\" Speculation is mounting that Martin Edwards is to step down as chief executive of Manchester United. But the club insist that no board reshuffle has been decided on yet. Sheffield Wednesday chairman Howard Culley has survived a vote of no-confidence.

      "body": "<p>Just as films are released to cinema in the US and Canada up to six months faster than in the UK, so DVDs make it to market more quickly there. This means that, when a film such as the Star Trek parody Galaxy Quest (pictured), starring Sigourney Weaver, was released at cinemas this side of the Atlantic, DVD watchers on the other side could buy the film to watch at home. </p> <p>So why not just order the latest DVD films over the internet? The film moguls don't make it that easy: they have devised a regional coding system to protect their interests, the US being classified as region one (R1) and Europe as region two (R2). </p> <p>UK DVD players are configured so that R1 discs will not play. An error message is usually displayed on screen to this effect. But software systems like this can be beaten, either by simple remote keystroke sequences (see <a href=\"http://www.dvdweb.co.uk\">www.dvdweb.co.uk</a>) or by fitting a relatively simple extra circuit board to your player which bypasses the regional coding protection mechanism. This latter solution will, of course, invalidate any warranty, but many firms selling the extra chipsets offer back-up warranties - provided they fit the unit. </p> <p>The Peterborough firm of Link Electronics (<a href=\"http://www.linkonline.co.uk\">www.linkonline.co.uk</a>) is excellent in this respect, as are others, most of which advertise in monthly DVD and movie magazines. The cost of the extra circuit board is usually \u00a340 to \u00a360, including fitting and carriage both ways; it's less if you buy and fit the chipset yourself, which is easy for anyone competent with a screwdriver and soldering iron. Afterwards, instead of the miserly 2,000-odd R2 DVD releases sold in the UK, you will have access to the 12,000 (and growing) list of R1 DVD discs available in the US. Buying R1 discs on the internet is easy. You can use one or more of several sites in the US, which charge $6 to $8 (\u00a35 or so) to send a disc by airmail, usually within three to five working days. </p> <p>Canadian DVD suppliers are an even better option. To encourage US buyers, almost all Canadian suppliers will ship to the US (and worldwide) free of charge, which trims the total price of a typical DVD disc to between \u00a312 and \u00a315. That's around \u00a35 cheaper than an R2 disc costs in Britain, and still slightly less than many of the R2 DVD-selling websites charge in the UK. </p> <p>Current customs &amp; excise rules mean that personal imports of software - and DVDs fall into this category - worth less than \u00a318 are not surcharged as they enter the UK. This means that, for single DVDs sent from the US and Canada, there is no import duty. Don't be tempted to order two or more discs from US websites, which occasionally have R1 discs in advance of their Canadian cousins thanks to the quirky world of DVD release schedules, as customs plus Post Office handling charges will wipe out any postage charge savings. Good Canadian sites which ship free of charge to the UK are DVD Dynamic (<a href=\"http://www.dvddynamic.com\">www.dvddynamic.com</a>), DVD Box Office (<a href=\"http://www.dvdboxoffice.com\">www.dvdboxoffice.com</a>) and DVD North (<a href=\"http://www.dvdnorth.com\">www.dvdnorth.com</a>) </p> <p>DVD Dynamic ships via Canadian airmail and is an excellent all-rounder, with prices around \u00a31 to \u00a33 cheaper than many US websites which charge up to $8 (\u00a35 or so) for shipping. DVD Box Office has a wider selection of discs, but bulk ships UK-bound shipments to Europe by carrier (usually to Heathrow), and mails them on via the Royal Mail. Discs will take up to two weeks to reach you this way. </p> <p>Customer support over at DVD North is mediocre, but the site has a number of film noir releases other Canadian sites do not, so this site may be the best choice for film buffs. US sites worth checking out include DVD Empire (<a href=\"http://www.empire.com\">www.empire.com</a>), the excellent DVD Express (<a href=\"http://www.dvdexpress.com\">www.dvdexpress.com</a>), Amazon US (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com\">www.amazon.com</a>), Reel.com (<a href=\"http://www.reel.com\">www.reel.com</a>) and 800.com (<a href=\"http://www.800.com\">www.800.com</a>). </p> <p>There's even a secondhand DVD site at <a href=\"http://www.secondspin.com\">www.secondspin.com</a>. Service here is good and they understand the needs of UK customers. If you order goods from abroad on the web, then you will almost certainly be using a credit or debit card. Credit card issuers can add up to 2.85% to the transaction when they convert to sterling, which ends up on your bill. Debit card issuers tend to be slightly cheaper at between 0.5 and 2.0% in commission charges - building societies seem to be cheaper on Visa debit card transactions in this respect. On the whole, it's safer to use a credit card to order on the web, and especially from non-UK suppliers, as your card issuer is obliged to help you unravel any problems if anything should go wrong, such as a supplier going bust or mail going astray (rarely from the US and Canada). </p> <p>Don't feel ripped off by the plastic card commissions, as they are usually more than offset by the good exchange rates that Visa and MasterCard offer. It's also worth noting that using your Switch card's Maestro facility (Maestro is an international option on many Switch cards) for ordering online from foreign suppliers is not the best option, as the rates are not usually nearly as good as Visa/Mastercard, once the banks have creamed off commission. </p> <p>You can check the growing number of web-based price comparison services such as DVD Price Search (<a href=\"http://www.dvdpricesearch.com\">www.dvdpricesearch.com</a>) and DVD Update (<a href=\"http://www.dvdupdate.com\">www.dvdupdate.com</a>), both of which take into account UK postage costs from most sites. However, since these sites make their money from advertising and commissions from websites they include in their search engines, not all US and Canadian sites are returned in their search results. Despite this limitation, the sites are a good pointer for money savers in the world of R1 DVD imports. </p> <p>It's also possible to buy R1 DVDs from a growing number of UK and European websites that sell discs on this side of the Atlantic. The movie industry is not pleased with UK suppliers for doing this because they claim it spoils their film release schedules, as well as infringing copyright. For this reason, the number of suppliers is limited and prices tend to be higher than if you import the discs yourself. You can end up paying \u00a320 or more from some suppliers. If you are worried about buying from US and Canadian sites on the web, sites such as Play 247 (<a href=\"http://www.play247.com\">www.play247.com</a>) and DC DVD (<a href=\"http://www.dc-dvd.co.uk\">www.dc-dvd.co.uk</a>) can be a useful alternative. </p> <p>The movie industry seems to be waking up to the fact that large numbers of film buffs are tweaking their DVD players to play R1 discs and are starting to release R2 discs more quickly than VHS cassettes. You may find that an R2 DVD is on sale at the same time as the VHS video version in on rental at your local video store. High street prices for R2 DVDs are a joke compared to the web mail order prices available, however. Sites such as <a href=\"http://www.dvdstreet.com\">www.dvdstreet.com</a>, <a href=\"http://www.blackstar.co.uk\">www.blackstar.co.uk</a> are reknowned for their keen prices, free postage and excellent customer services, plus all the usual suspects - <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk\">www.amazon.co.uk</a>, <a href=\"http://www.whsmith.co.uk\">www.whsmith.co.uk</a>, <a href=\"http://www.hmv.co.uk\">www.hmv.co.uk</a> et al - can also supply, but tend to add postage which cuts down on cost savings. Shop Smart (<a href=\"http://www.shopsmart.com\">www.shopsmart.com</a>) is also worth checking out for R2 DVDs. This site, like its US cousins, searches several UK supplier sites for the best prices but, like the US sites, does not cover all suppliers, so doing it yourself online may be a better option.</p>",

If you order goods from abroad on the web, then you will almost certainly be using a credit or debit card. Credit card issuers can add up to 2.85% to the transaction when they convert to sterling, which ends up on your bill. Debit card issuers tend to be slightly cheaper at between 0.5 and 2.0% in commission charges - building societies seem to be cheaper on Visa debit card transactions in this respect. On the whole, it's safer to use a credit card to order on the web, and especially from non-UK suppliers, as your card issuer is obliged to help you unravel any problems if anything should go wrong, such as a supplier going bust or mail going astray (rarely from the US and Canada). Don't feel ripped off by the plastic card commissions, as they are usually more than offset by the good exchange rates that Visa and MasterCard offer. It's also worth noting that using your Switch card's Maestro facility (Maestro is an international option on many Switch cards) for ordering online from foreign suppliers is not the best option, as the rates are not usually nearly as good as Visa/Mastercard, once the banks have creamed off commission. You can check the growing number of web-based price comparison services such as DVD Price Search (www.dvdpricesearch.com) and DVD Update (www.dvdupdate.com), both of which take into account UK postage costs from most sites. However, since these sites make their money from advertising and commissions from websites they include in their search engines, not all US and Canadian sites are returned in their search results. Despite this limitation, the sites are a good pointer for money savers in the world of R1 DVD imports. It's also possible to buy R1 DVDs from a growing number of UK and European websites that sell discs on this side of the Atlantic. The movie industry is not pleased with UK suppliers for doing this because they claim it spoils their film release schedules, as well as infringing copyright. For this reason, the number of suppliers is limited and prices tend to be higher than if you import the discs yourself. You can end up paying \u00a320 or more from some suppliers. If you are worried about buying from US and Canadian sites on the web, sites such as Play 247 (www.play247.com) and DC DVD (www.dc-dvd.co.uk) can be a useful alternative. The movie industry seems to be waking up to the fact that large numbers of film buffs are tweaking their DVD players to play R1 discs and are starting to release R2 discs more quickly than VHS cassettes. You may find that an R2 DVD is on sale at the same time as the VHS video version in on rental at your local video store. High street prices for R2 DVDs are a joke compared to the web mail order prices available, however. Sites such as www.dvdstreet.com, www.blackstar.co.uk are reknowned for their keen prices, free postage and excellent customer services, plus all the usual suspects - www.amazon.co.uk, www.whsmith.co.uk, www.hmv.co.uk et al - can also supply, but tend to add postage which cuts down on cost savings. Shop Smart (www.shopsmart.com) is also worth checking out for R2 DVDs. This site, like its US cousins, searches several UK supplier sites for the best prices but, like the US sites, does not cover all suppliers, so doing it yourself online may be a better option.",

Social work is an international profession with an international research base demonstrating its need and efficacy. Just because David Brindle wishes social workers and service users away, won't make us go away. Sue Talbot, social worker . So we've done it! The hospital waiting list target has at last been reached, at God knows what human cost, both to the patients and to the staff. Now can we abandon it as a monument to management by headlines? The government and the NHS management are to be congratulated on their strength of will and their determination to deliver their promises. But what matters is how long we have to wait and how urgent our problem is, and we need a more sophisticated measure than the number of people waiting in front of us. Perhaps deciding on some new targets should be part of the National Plan for the NHS? Martin Rathfelder, Socialist Health Association . Changes in health care delivery should be evidence based, like treatments, or if the evidence does not exist, the subject of pilot schemes. The key areas are; including independence of the public health function; the need to resolve the long term care of elderly people and; the democratic deficit. The last named is best tackled by having a fully representative and accountable health authority, preferably elected, with responsibility for all the NHS provision in its area. The necessary cooperative working between the various parts of the service is not best served by a system of autonomous trusts in both hospital and primary care and the perpetuation of the artificial and costly separation between purchaser and provider. The government must recognise that while there are some bad apples, the majority of health service staff are well motivated and hard working. Peter Fisher, NHS consultants' association . Strengthening public health doesn't simply imply reducing the dominance of acute sector medicine since this requires action across public policy, including transport, food, housing, etc, none of which has much to do with the NHS or with medicine. This strengthens the argument for moving public health functions from the department of health, upgrading the rank of the minister for public health, and tackling health inequalities by combating social exclusion. Let's get away from the false equation that medicine equals health. Dr G Rayner, UK Public Health",

      "bodyText": "The National Union of Students wants to see future government policy back up the current government rhetoric. We are especially keen to see a manifesto commitment against the creation of differential top-up fees. Allowing top universities to privatise and create a two-tier higher education system would undermine every effort to battle elitism. Talented students from lower income backgrounds are already paying more - student contributions have increased by \u00a31.4bn per year under this government. Standard rate tuition fees were introduced in 1997, just after the general election, with no manifesto mandate. On the one occasion the electorate has had to vote on the issue - the Scottish Parliament election in 1999 - it voted to reject fees. If the government really wants to improve access to education then it should listen to the independent Cubie inquiry; rule out top-up fees and introduce targeted maintenance grants. Undoubtedly, universities remain under-funded. The NUS suggests that the best way to increase the flow of funds into universities is via a regulated business contribution to solve the funding gap. Currently, business is the stakeholder group which contributes the least to higher education but benefits the most. Students need well-resourced lecturers, just as lecturers need properly funded students. Lecturers who are poorly motivated by discriminatory pay or students who are distracted from their studies by part-time jobs, or forced to drop out through hardship, are of no credit to higher education. Education in the 21st century must be based on equal access for students and fairness at work for lecturers.",

      "body": "<b>What football will we be able to watch on TV?</b> <br> Next season's Premier League TV coverage will continue as before, with BBC1 showing the Match of the Day highlights package on Saturday night while BSkyB cover matches live. <p>For 2001/2 it will be all change, with a new deal lasting three years. ITV will broadcast a highlights package, fronted by former Beeb favourite Des Lynam, on Saturdays and Sundays. Live match coverage is split between BSkyB, which will show 66 matches a season, and cable company NTL, which will offer 40 pay-per-view live matches (choosing them after BSkyB has picked its 66 matches). Premier League clubs will also be able to show their own matches on their own TV channels, such as Manchester United's MUTV, and on their websites after midnight on Monday.</p> <p>Other live football is subject to different arrangements. Coverage of European club competitions will continue to be split between ITV, OnDigital and BSkyB. With no new deals to cover football in the bag, the BBC will be even more determined to win rights to England international matches and the FA Cup. Don't hold your breath, but they could yet snatch the right to cover the Worthington Cup.</p> <p><b>How will the deal benefit football?</b><br> In short, it means massive amounts of money for the Premier League. The current \u00a3670.5m deal provides every Premier League club with at least \u00a310m each season. The new \u00a31.1bn deal gives every club around \u00a325m. This will enable clubs to attract top talent, while the expanded TV coverage will probably continue to contribute towards football's growing popularity, as it has done over the last decade. </p> <p><b>What are the drawbacks?</b><br> The money is an obvious boon for the top clubs, but there are three main concerns:</p> <p><b>1. Falling attendances</b> Live TV coverage occasionally causes a particular game to have a lower attendance than it otherwise would. But the idea that wall-to-wall TV coverage causes a drop in attendance was disproved during the 1990s, when televised games proliferated while at the same time crowd numbers steadily increased. </p> <p><b>2. An unsustainable boom</b> Most of the TV cash is likely to go towards meeting the cost of increasingly large wage bills for star players. The capacity of English clubs to pay the best wages in the world will tempt an increasing number of big-name foreign players to the Premier League. Wage bills could spiral out of control. Clubs' complete dependency on an ever-growing pot of TV money could also be unhealthy. In its most recent six-monthly financial results, Manchester United's money from ticket sales was down, while merchandising rose 15% per cent and TV revenue increased by 73%. </p> <p><b>3. A widening gap between rich and poor</b> The riches handed to the Premier League drastically increase the disparity between the 20 Premiership clubs and the 72 other professional clubs in the first, second and third divisions. It is a classic example of a free market in action.</p> <p>Some argue that the TV wealth does trickle down from the Premier League to the lower leagues. But many believe that the widening chasm between the top 20 and the rest will not be beneficial for football as a whole. The growth of this gap (in media coverage, profits, wages and skills) in the 1990s is demonstrated by the tendency of those clubs promoted to the Premier League to get relegated at the end of their first season. Only the richest of the clubs promoted in the last decade, such as Newcastle and Sunderland (with one remarkably well-managed exception; Leicester City), have survived in the top flight. The Premier League could become a de facto closed shop. A widening skills gap might even encourage it to cut ties with the other leagues.</p> <p>Spiralling wage bills are likely to bankrupt many lower league clubs. A few will become \"feeder\" organisations for Premier League clubs, agreeing to hand over all the best young players they develop in return for financial support. The number, character and diversity of England and Wales's 72 professional clubs is likely to be irrevocably diminished. </p> <p><b>Is it good for the TV companies?</b><br> Premier League TV rights are widely credited with saving BSkyB in 1992, which attracted a huge number of new users to its subscription satellite channel service after buying exclusive rights to show live football. BSkyB views the retention of those rights as central to its future success. Both BSkyB and NTL will want to recoup their colossal investment and consumers will face a big hike in subscription rates and pay-per-view prices.</p> <p>Winning the right to replace Match of the Day with its own highlights package is a major coup for ITV. But BBC director general Greg Dyke today said that the ITV bid made \"no economic sense\" and predicted that it may relinquish its rights in the future because they come at too high a price. While it will be able to charge premium rates for advertising slots around its coverage, it lacks the revenue potential of subscription channels or pay-per-view.</p> <p><b>And the consumer?</b><br> The armchair supporter will delight in round-the-clock Premier League coverage, but will have to pay more for it. The supporter of a Premier League club will enjoy watching big foreign stars, although clubs are unlikely to use their TV cash to reduce ticket prices. And spectators in the lower leagues may endure hard times - or even witness their club's extinction. </p>",

      "bodyText": "What football will we be able to watch on TV? Next season's Premier League TV coverage will continue as before, with BBC1 showing the Match of the Day highlights package on Saturday night while BSkyB cover matches live. For 2001/2 it will be all change, with a new deal lasting three years. ITV will broadcast a highlights package, fronted by former Beeb favourite Des Lynam, on Saturdays and Sundays. Live match coverage is split between BSkyB, which will show 66 matches a season, and cable company NTL, which will offer 40 pay-per-view live matches (choosing them after BSkyB has picked its 66 matches). Premier League clubs will also be able to show their own matches on their own TV channels, such as Manchester United's MUTV, and on their websites after midnight on Monday. Other live football is subject to different arrangements. Coverage of European club competitions will continue to be split between ITV, OnDigital and BSkyB. With no new deals to cover football in the bag, the BBC will be even more determined to win rights to England international matches and the FA Cup. Don't hold your breath, but they could yet snatch the right to cover the Worthington Cup. How will the deal benefit football? In short, it means massive amounts of money for the Premier League. The current \u00a3670.5m deal provides every Premier League club with at least \u00a310m each season. The new \u00a31.1bn deal gives every club around \u00a325m. This will enable clubs to attract top talent, while the expanded TV coverage will probably continue to contribute towards football's growing popularity, as it has done over the last decade. What are the drawbacks? The money is an obvious boon for the top clubs, but there are three main concerns: 1. Falling attendances Live TV coverage occasionally causes a particular game to have a lower attendance than it otherwise would. But the idea that wall-to-wall TV coverage causes a drop in attendance was disproved during the 1990s, when televised games proliferated while at the same time crowd numbers steadily increased. 2. An unsustainable boom Most of the TV cash is likely to go towards meeting the cost of increasingly large wage bills for star players. The capacity of English clubs to pay the best wages in the world will tempt an increasing number of big-name foreign players to the Premier League. Wage bills could spiral out of control. Clubs' complete dependency on an ever-growing pot of TV money could also be unhealthy. In its most recent six-monthly financial results, Manchester United's money from ticket sales was down, while merchandising rose 15% per cent and TV revenue increased by 73%. 3. A widening gap between rich and poor The riches handed to the Premier League drastically increase the disparity between the 20 Premiership clubs and the 72 other professional clubs in the first, second and third divisions. It is a classic example of a free market in action. Some argue that the TV wealth does trickle down from the Premier League to the lower leagues. But many believe that the widening chasm between the top 20 and the rest will not be beneficial for football as a whole. The growth of this gap (in media coverage, profits, wages and skills) in the 1990s is demonstrated by the tendency of those clubs promoted to the Premier League to get relegated at the end of their first season. Only the richest of the clubs promoted in the last decade, such as Newcastle and Sunderland (with one remarkably well-managed exception; Leicester City), have survived in the top flight. The Premier League could become a de facto closed shop. A widening skills gap might even encourage it to cut ties with the other leagues. Spiralling wage bills are likely to bankrupt many lower league clubs. A few will become \"feeder\" organisations for Premier League clubs, agreeing to hand over all the best young players they develop in return for financial support. The number, character and diversity of England and Wales's 72 professional clubs is likely to be irrevocably diminished. Is it good for the TV companies? Premier League TV rights are widely credited with saving BSkyB in 1992, which attracted a huge number of new users to its subscription satellite channel service after buying exclusive rights to show live football. BSkyB views the retention of those rights as central to its future success. Both BSkyB and NTL will want to recoup their colossal investment and consumers will face a big hike in subscription rates and pay-per-view prices. Winning the right to replace Match of the Day with its own highlights package is a major coup for ITV. But BBC director general Greg Dyke today said that the ITV bid made \"no economic sense\" and predicted that it may relinquish its rights in the future because they come at too high a price. While it will be able to charge premium rates for advertising slots around its coverage, it lacks the revenue potential of subscription channels or pay-per-view. And the consumer? The armchair supporter will delight in round-the-clock Premier League coverage, but will have to pay more for it. The supporter of a Premier League club will enjoy watching big foreign stars, although clubs are unlikely to use their TV cash to reduce ticket prices. And spectators in the lower leagues may endure hard times - or even witness their club's extinction.",

      "body": "<p><strong>Could you solve a pub debate? When was the last Gentlemen versus Players match, and who were the captains? </strong> asks Keith Roberts </p> <p>The distinction between professionals (the Players) and amateurs (the Gentlemen) in English cricket was abolished in 1962, so that was the last year this famous fixture was played. The captains were suitably typical of the flinty paid professional and the supposedly devil-may-care unpaid true-Blue amateur - Fred Trueman (Yorkshire) of the Players and Ted Dexter (Cambridge University and Sussex) of the Gents. The game, played at Lord's in July 1962, was drawn. The Rev. David Sheppard and Roger Prideaux both scored Gentlemanly centuries, and Trevor Bailey later took six wickets for them. Sheppard's hundred won him a place on that winter's tour of Australia, 12 years after his previous trip there.</p> <p><strong>Did Garry Sobers score a century on his Test debut?</strong> asks Glen Wheattem</p> <p>No, he very much did not. Sobers didn't score a Test century until his 17th appearance, against Pakistan at Kingston in 1957-58. He did make up for it by taking his score to 365 not out, which remained a Test record for 36 years. Sobers had made his debut in the final Test against England in 1953-54, when he was only 17. He won selection for that game as a slow left-arm bowler (and batted at No.9): his first Test wicket was that of Trevor Bailey, who later wrote a biography of him. Sobers went on to play four Tests against Australia in 1954-55, four in New Zealand in 1955-56, all five in England in 1957, and the first two against Pakistan in 1957-58 without reaching three figures. Before that 1957-58 series he had made only three half-centuries, but he took a great liking to the Pakistan attack: innings of 52, 52 and 80 were followed by the 365*, then two more hundreds - 125 and 109* - at Georgetown. </p> <p> He never looked back as a batsman: three more hundreds in his next three Tests, and 26 in all in 93 matches, finishing with 8032 runs at the tremendous average of 57.78. He was a fine bowler too - he ended up with 235 wickets, mainly taken in his seam-and-swing mode - and a fabulous fielder (109 catches). All in all Garfield St Aubrun Sobers, who was knighted by the Queen in 1975, shortly after his retirement, was probably the greatest allrounder cricket has ever seen.</p> <p> <strong>One FH Farrands played for MCC in the late 19th century, and then became an umpire. There may be a family connection, so can you tell me any more about him?</strong> asks Steve Farrands</p> <p>Frank Henry Farrands was born in Sutton-in-Ashfield in Nottinghamshire on March 28, 1835, and died there on Sept 22, 1916. He was a right-hand batsman and a fastish roundarm bowler at a time before full overarm bowling was the norm. He was on the MCC groundstaff for many years, starting in 1868 or possibly before, and also played two matches for Notts. He later became an umpire, and stood in seven Test matches between 1884 and 1888. One of the record-books notes that his surname is given as \"Farrand\" on his death certificate.</p> <p> <strong>Is there a layman's guide to the Duckworth-Lewis system? I would like to be able to programme my hand-held computer to do the calculations (OK, so I'm an anorak)</strong> says Graham Porter</p> <p>The Duckworth-Lewis method of deciding targets in rain-affected one-day games is not easy to understand, so I wish you luck with your programming! Basically the system works out what resources are left to the batting side - if you have all ten wickets standing, that's 100% of your wicket resources, and if you have used up 20 of your 50 overs when it rains, that's 60% of your overs left. You put the two together, find out the overall resources available and compare that with the other team's total. You can find a fuller explanation of the system, written by Messrs (or Professors) Duckworth and Lewis themselves, on CricInfo at http://www-uk.cricket.org/link_to_database/ABOUT_CRICKET/RAIN_RULES/DUCKWORT H _LEWIS_1999.html</p> <p> <strong>Who was named as the Cornhill Insurance England Player of the Year in April?</strong> asks Linda Rose</p> <p>It was Somerset's Andrew Caddick, who received a cheque for \u00a311,000 and a glass trophy. The award covered last summer in England and the winter tour. Caddick returned to the England side against New Zealand last summer and took 20 wickets in the four Tests, then added 16 more in South Africa. Cornhill's sponsorship of Tests in England will end this summer, after 23 years and 131 matches.</p> <p> <strong>Are internationals played in South Africa or Australia between May and September?</strong> asks Waqar Ali</p> <p>Not until this year! That time is winter in both countries, so not much cricket is played. But there will be a short series of one-day internationals in Australia in August, the first ever to be played indoors. The matches, all against South Africa, are scheduled for Aug 16, 18 and 20 at the new Colonial Stadium in Melbourne's Docklands. It's a big new stadium with a retractable roof, which will be kept shut for the cricket. If anyone manages to hit the roof with a shot it will be called \"dead ball\".</p> <p> <strong>Who was the last England batsman to score a Test double-century?</strong> asks Alison Bilton</p> <p>The last one (to date) was Nasser Hussain's 207 at Edgbaston in 1997. He and Graham Thorpe (138) put on 288 for the fourth wicket, and cemented England's position after Australia had been shot out on the first day for 118. England won that match by nine wickets - but Australia came back to take the series 3-2.</p> <p> <strong>My father and I have been arguing about the England v Rest of the World series in 1970, which was arranged after the South African tour was cancelled. Were full England caps awarded? And are these matches treated as Tests in the record books?</strong> asks MB Ryder-Whish</p> <p>The five matches in that series were promoted and played as proper Tests at the time, but it was later decided to remove them from the record-books. The records stayed in \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\" until 1979, but were then quietly dropped. It was rough luck for Alan Jones of Glamorgan, whose only England appearances came in that series. As it happens, I wrote a feature about the series in the June 2000 edition of \"Wisden Cricket Monthly\": you can find that by <a href=\"http://www.wisden.com/Wisden_Cricket_Monthly/Taster/0,5663,332361,00.html\"> clicking here</a></p> <p><em>Steven Lynch is managing editor of Wisden Cricket Monthly</em></p> <p>We regret that not all questions can be answered and that personal correspondence can only sometimes be entered into</p>",

      "bodyText": "Could you solve a pub debate? When was the last Gentlemen versus Players match, and who were the captains? asks Keith Roberts The distinction between professionals (the Players) and amateurs (the Gentlemen) in English cricket was abolished in 1962, so that was the last year this famous fixture was played. The captains were suitably typical of the flinty paid professional and the supposedly devil-may-care unpaid true-Blue amateur - Fred Trueman (Yorkshire) of the Players and Ted Dexter (Cambridge University and Sussex) of the Gents. The game, played at Lord's in July 1962, was drawn. The Rev. David Sheppard and Roger Prideaux both scored Gentlemanly centuries, and Trevor Bailey later took six wickets for them. Sheppard's hundred won him a place on that winter's tour of Australia, 12 years after his previous trip there. Did Garry Sobers score a century on his Test debut? asks Glen Wheattem No, he very much did not. Sobers didn't score a Test century until his 17th appearance, against Pakistan at Kingston in 1957-58. He did make up for it by taking his score to 365 not out, which remained a Test record for 36 years. Sobers had made his debut in the final Test against England in 1953-54, when he was only 17. He won selection for that game as a slow left-arm bowler (and batted at No.9): his first Test wicket was that of Trevor Bailey, who later wrote a biography of him. Sobers went on to play four Tests against Australia in 1954-55, four in New Zealand in 1955-56, all five in England in 1957, and the first two against Pakistan in 1957-58 without reaching three figures. Before that 1957-58 series he had made only three half-centuries, but he took a great liking to the Pakistan attack: innings of 52, 52 and 80 were followed by the 365*, then two more hundreds - 125 and 109* - at Georgetown. He never looked back as a batsman: three more hundreds in his next three Tests, and 26 in all in 93 matches, finishing with 8032 runs at the tremendous average of 57.78. He was a fine bowler too - he ended up with 235 wickets, mainly taken in his seam-and-swing mode - and a fabulous fielder (109 catches). All in all Garfield St Aubrun Sobers, who was knighted by the Queen in 1975, shortly after his retirement, was probably the greatest allrounder cricket has ever seen. One FH Farrands played for MCC in the late 19th century, and then became an umpire. There may be a family connection, so can you tell me any more about him? asks Steve Farrands Frank Henry Farrands was born in Sutton-in-Ashfield in Nottinghamshire on March 28, 1835, and died there on Sept 22, 1916. He was a right-hand batsman and a fastish roundarm bowler at a time before full overarm bowling was the norm. He was on the MCC groundstaff for many years, starting in 1868 or possibly before, and also played two matches for Notts. He later became an umpire, and stood in seven Test matches between 1884 and 1888. One of the record-books notes that his surname is given as \"Farrand\" on his death certificate. Is there a layman's guide to the Duckworth-Lewis system? I would like to be able to programme my hand-held computer to do the calculations (OK, so I'm an anorak) says Graham Porter The Duckworth-Lewis method of deciding targets in rain-affected one-day games is not easy to understand, so I wish you luck with your programming! Basically the system works out what resources are left to the batting side - if you have all ten wickets standing, that's 100% of your wicket resources, and if you have used up 20 of your 50 overs when it rains, that's 60% of your overs left. You put the two together, find out the overall resources available and compare that with the other team's total. You can find a fuller explanation of the system, written by Messrs (or Professors) Duckworth and Lewis themselves, on CricInfo at http://www-uk.cricket.org/link_to_database/ABOUT_CRICKET/RAIN_RULES/DUCKWORT H _LEWIS_1999.html Who was named as the Cornhill Insurance England Player of the Year in April? asks Linda Rose It was Somerset's Andrew Caddick, who received a cheque for \u00a311,000 and a glass trophy. The award covered last summer in England and the winter tour. Caddick returned to the England side against New Zealand last summer and took 20 wickets in the four Tests, then added 16 more in South Africa. Cornhill's sponsorship of Tests in England will end this summer, after 23 years and 131 matches. Are internationals played in South Africa or Australia between May and September? asks Waqar Ali Not until this year! That time is winter in both countries, so not much cricket is played. But there will be a short series of one-day internationals in Australia in August, the first ever to be played indoors. The matches, all against South Africa, are scheduled for Aug 16, 18 and 20 at the new Colonial Stadium in Melbourne's Docklands. It's a big new stadium with a retractable roof, which will be kept shut for the cricket. If anyone manages to hit the roof with a shot it will be called \"dead ball\". Who was the last England batsman to score a Test double-century? asks Alison Bilton The last one (to date) was Nasser Hussain's 207 at Edgbaston in 1997. He and Graham Thorpe (138) put on 288 for the fourth wicket, and cemented England's position after Australia had been shot out on the first day for 118. England won that match by nine wickets - but Australia came back to take the series 3-2. My father and I have been arguing about the England v Rest of the World series in 1970, which was arranged after the South African tour was cancelled. Were full England caps awarded? And are these matches treated as Tests in the record books? asks MB Ryder-Whish The five matches in that series were promoted and played as proper Tests at the time, but it was later decided to remove them from the record-books. The records stayed in \"Wisden Cricketers' Almanack\" until 1979, but were then quietly dropped. It was rough luck for Alan Jones of Glamorgan, whose only England appearances came in that series. As it happens, I wrote a feature about the series in the June 2000 edition of \"Wisden Cricket Monthly\": you can find that by clicking here Steven Lynch is managing editor of Wisden Cricket Monthly We regret that not all questions can be answered and that personal correspondence can only sometimes be entered into",

The standings now look like this: Mike Hodgkinson \u00a368.75 Sean Ingle \u00a364.56 Scott Murray \u00a364.17 Paul MacInnes \u00a338 Now for the selections for today's Turkey v Sweden game. Mike Hodgkinson Sergen Yalcin first scorer 10-1 (\u00a35) Turkey have the worst goalkeeper in the competition, by miles, which may make the selection of a Turkish first scorer look a bit thick. On the other hand, Rustu Recber might get dropped - and Sergen Yalcin showed against Italy he's more than willing to have a go from distance. Sweden don't look up to much - Turkey can draw first blood. Sean Ingle Turkey to win 15/8 (\u00a310) How do you assess this one? Both teams are coming off losses, both have obvious defensive flaws and both desperately need a win. If history is any guide, then Turkey hold a slight edge. They've won two games to one in the four meetings between the countries. However, there are all sorts of imponderables regarding tonight's game: Is Larsson anywhere near fit? Will the intense media pressure overwhelm or inspire the temperamental Turks? And how are Freddie Ljungberg's feet? But for me the key factor is Sweden's defence. It fell apart against Belgium - and is even more weakened now Roland Nilsson is out with concussion and Patrick Andersson is suspended. It'll be close, but I take Turkey to win. Scott Murray Draw 9/4 (\u00a310) Neither of these teams cut the mustard in their opening match, so odds of just over twos for a stalemate seem worth a punt.

The slow pace and austere style of his work are utterly against current trends, and the content is invariably as formidably intellectual as it is emotional and poetic. He is, to put it bluntly, not everybody's idea of a good night out. At his best, however, he is unquestionably a master.

It will certainly judge The Travelling Players (O Thiassos) a classic. </p> <p>It was filmed in Greece in 1974, at no small risk, under the hard-line rule of the Greek colonels' junta. Why the military police who watched its progress allowed it to be completed is a mystery, since the film clearly examines the turbulent history of its country of origin from a radical Brechtian point of view. Perhaps the colonels' men thought that this story of a troupe of itinerant actors touring Golfo the Shepherdess, a pastoral folk drama set to music and song, was harmless enough. But it wasn't, since the period in which it is set (1939 to 1952) warmed the seeds of their masters' military coup. </p> <p>Almost four hours long, The Travelling Players has its actors first watch and then get caught up in the political events of the period, so that even the play changes its emphasis. As they progress through the often rainy and wintry provincial Greece in which Angelopoulos usually prefers to shoot, the sequences become longer and longer and the pace seldom changes. The whole film is accomplished in around 80 shots. </p> <p>But despite that, and even though no one but a Greek can understand all the political, historical and mythic allusions, it is a fascinating progress, enlivened by Yorgos Arvanitis's often luminous photography, Loukianos Kilaidonis's throbbing music, including songs and dances adapted from folk sources, and performances that seem utterly truthful. </p> <p>How does Angelopoulos achieve this magic? It is partly the utter conviction with which he steers his work towards an inner as well as an outward relevance. But take a look, if you want to see how he manages individual sequences, at the closing passage of this film, when one of the actors is executed for sedition and his fellow performers raise their hands above their heads to applaud his life at the graveside. Nothing could be done more simply - though in most successful simplicity there is a great deal of artfulness. But the sequence, perhaps because of all that has gone before, is far more moving than the myriad funeral scenes in movies manage to be. It has a grace that is almost totally absent from most of today's cinema. </p> <p>In many ways Angelopoulos has been lucky. As the outstanding Greek director, he has had his every whim granted over the last half of his career by the cultural wing of the country's government. And he is clearly a difficult man to satisfy. But he has forged a unique if often pessimistic style through which to examine as minutely as he can his own country and countrymen. If you were to see all his dozen or so films, you would have not only a much greater appreciation of Greek and Balkan conflicts, but a larger view of the inner turmoil of individuals whose lives have been altered by them.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Several newspapers report that David Ginola is to join Aston Villa for \u00a33m. Director of football David Pleat said today: \"After some discussion the club have agreed to allow David Ginola to speak to Villa.\" The Sun suggests that while a deal to take Ginola to the Midlands is far from cut and dried, the fact that George Graham is prepared to sell his star winger means it is unlikely Ginola will play for Spurs again. The Sun believes that Martin O'Neill wants to bring Leeds' Michael Duberry to Celtic, and is prepared to pay \u00a36m for his services. Leeds are willing to trade in on the central defender, only 12 months after buying him, and the 24-year-old could be used as bait to persuade Celtic into selling striker Mark Viduka. Planet Football meanwhile reports that if Celtic do sell Viduka, they will look to bring in Middlesbrough's Hamilton Ricard as a replacement. The website also suggests that Martin O'Neill will bid for Hibs' highly-rated youngster Kenny Miller. Everton are after Newcastle's Alessandro Pistone, according to the Daily Mail. The paper believes the two clubs have agreed on a deal for the 24-year-old fullback, with the fee in the region of \u00a33m. Walter Smith is also believed to be looking at Aston Villa's former England winger Steve Stone. Three English clubs have declared an interest in Portuguese striker Joao Pinto, according to the player himself. \"I admire English football and have many friends playing there,\" he told the Daily Express, \"so moving to England is something I would consider.\" Planet Football believes Chelsea are at the head of the queue. Arsenal have made a \u00a32m bid for Sweden striker Kennett Andersson. The Daily Star believes Arsene Wenger wants the 32-year-old as a replacement for Davor Suker. According to reports in Portugal, Lazio have bid \u00a336m for Luis Figo. Ispwich Town have completed a \u00a31m deal to bring Dutch international Martijn Reuser to the club.",

      "body": "<p>The first thing everyone notices about Jeff Bezos is the loud, infectious laugh that punctuates virtually his every sentence. The chief executive officer of Amazon.com, the world's largest e-tailer laughs at my jokes, laughs at his own jokes and even breaks into a hearty guffaw when his coffee turns up.</p> <p> But he has good reason to have a smile on his face. He might not yet have made any profit - which e-tailer has? - yet his internet business, started with a $300,000 loan from his parents, is now worth over $1bn. He literally is laughing all the way to the bank.</p> <p> He even manages to find a chuckle when I remind him that Amazon's shares were trading for twice as much at the end of 1999 as they are now.</p> <p> Bezos is on a short trip to London to speak at the Digital World conference and, in many respects, his visit couldn't have come at a more opportune time.</p> <p> The unbounded optimism surrounding the e-commerce industry that was so prevalent at the start of the year has now evaporated. And in some quarters Bezos' trip is seen as not just a short stopover for a leading businessman, but the arrival of the US Cavalry.</p> <p> Although it's clear that he has no truck with any notions of being perceived as the elder spokesperson of the e-commerce industry, he's quite happy to rally the troops. \"I am very confident about the future of e-commerce and especially Amazon,\" he exclaims. \"E-commerce is going to be a much bigger deal than people expected, even at the peak of the optimism in 1999.\"</p> <p> Quizzed about the current pessimism of the markets, and although he doesn't name names, Bezos has sharp words for some of his rival e-commerce ventures.</p> <p> \"It's clear now that there were certain companies that were over-hyped.

      "bodyText": "The first thing everyone notices about Jeff Bezos is the loud, infectious laugh that punctuates virtually his every sentence. The chief executive officer of Amazon.com, the world's largest e-tailer laughs at my jokes, laughs at his own jokes and even breaks into a hearty guffaw when his coffee turns up. But he has good reason to have a smile on his face. He might not yet have made any profit - which e-tailer has? - yet his internet business, started with a $300,000 loan from his parents, is now worth over $1bn. He literally is laughing all the way to the bank. He even manages to find a chuckle when I remind him that Amazon's shares were trading for twice as much at the end of 1999 as they are now. Bezos is on a short trip to London to speak at the Digital World conference and, in many respects, his visit couldn't have come at a more opportune time. The unbounded optimism surrounding the e-commerce industry that was so prevalent at the start of the year has now evaporated. And in some quarters Bezos' trip is seen as not just a short stopover for a leading businessman, but the arrival of the US Cavalry. Although it's clear that he has no truck with any notions of being perceived as the elder spokesperson of the e-commerce industry, he's quite happy to rally the troops. \"I am very confident about the future of e-commerce and especially Amazon,\" he exclaims. \"E-commerce is going to be a much bigger deal than people expected, even at the peak of the optimism in 1999.\" Quizzed about the current pessimism of the markets, and although he doesn't name names, Bezos has sharp words for some of his rival e-commerce ventures. \"It's clear now that there were certain companies that were over-hyped. They were focusing not on building a great business but on building stock, that never works. \"I think now US investors are more discriminating - they are looking more closely on how a business is likely to develop rather than how its stocks will fare.\" I wondered what Bezos thought of the UK's own e-commerce industry and in particular its flagship, Lastminute.com, but he's keeping his opinions to himself. \"If you say positive things about other websites they use it against you, while saying nasty things just isn't very nice.\" Predictably Bezos moves the conversation back to his own British website Amazon.co.uk. \"You know we have the biggest website in the UK don't you! Well do you know who our biggest competitor is?\" Before I have time to answer he's informed me that \"Amazon.co.uk's biggest rival is none other than its US parent site Amazon.com\" - cue the morning's heartiest chuckle so far. Bezos has, in the past, been portrayed as a bit of a nerd with a passion for books and sleep. He certainly has a quirky side to his personality. Until the recent birth of his first child he lived in a small two-bedroom apartment in Seattle. He's also notorious in America for being the boss who encourages his employees to make their own desks. And yes he's famous for insisting that he gets eight hours sleep a night. However, anyone expecting Amazon's CEO to be a hippiesque Ben and Jerry style businessman is way off the mark. Strip away Bezos' comfortable shoes and casual shirt and you'll uncover a surprisingly old school entrepreneur clearly driven by a desire to make money. Asked what advice he would give to college graduates keen to start their own e-business, he answers with a statement that seems completely at odds with the get-rich quick schemes that prevail in the UK's own Silicon Alley in Brick Lane, east London. \"I'd say to anyone who wants to run a successful e-commerce company - go out and get an education. Spend 5-10 years in a decent company and learn using someone else's dollars - only then will you be ready to go for it on you own.\" And while he admits to being \"completely passionate about books\", Bezos argues that when setting up Amazon he chose his product category systematically. \"I had a list of around 10 products that I thought Amazon could sell.

Of course, delivery costs will be a little more than a couple of his beloved Royal Mail stamps (he loves our postal service), but Bezos is confident that whether it be financial analysts requiring books for research, or simply forgetful businessmen ordering a last minute anniversary present for their wives, Britons will pay. It's ironic that it's his consumers' insatiable demand for instant access to his products that could pose the biggest threat to Bezos's business. In the future, online delivery of music via MP3 or video via broadband services could seriously eat into Amazon's future profit-margin.

I have no time for these limited walled garden systems.\" With Bezos about to tuck into his breakfast (he goes to work on an egg), I fired the two questions that I'd been itching to ask him from the start of the interview. If you had to recommend one book to all Amazon's customers, what would it be? Without hesitation Bezos names Kazuo Ishiguro's Remains Of The Day and seems genuinely disappointed when I reveal I haven't read it but have only seen the film. \"Go back home and order a copy,\" he instructs. \"You can get it from Amazon.co.uk!\" Once again Bezos explodes into fits of laughter.

The MPs are warning that a southern television giant wil undermine an independent media presence in the north as well as destroying thousands of jobs. The competition commission is expected to give a conditional go-ahead to the merger when its private report lands on Mr Byers's desk tomorrow. The \u00a38.3bn deal would create a dominant ITV player stretching across six TV franchises, ranging from Nottingham to Cornwall. Most ministers and officials accept the need for consolidation in ITV. But the new political pressure suggests Mr Byers now knows that allowing one company to own all the rich southern franchises would prompt a big backbench reaction. Granada has opposed the merger by mounting a largely tactical counter-bid to buy Carlton. Three northern Labour MPs have tabled oral questions for Mr Byers to answer in the Commons today, demanding he protect Granada. One of the MPs, Philip Woolas, for Oldham East and Saddleworth, said: \"If the merger goes ahead, the four richest franchises - Central and Carlton, owned by Carlton, and Meridian and Anglia, owned by United - will fall under one company, giving the merged company an effective stranglehold on advertising placement. This is becoming a big north-south issue.

The company boosts the north-west economy by \u00a3188m a year. Mr Byers, a Tyneside MP, has about six weeks to decide on whether to accept the competition commission report, or to set strict conditions. Northern MPs do not want the single independent company to go ahead until a new legislative framework is established. Existing rules restrict any company to 15% of the total TV audience, and restrict the share of all TV advertising by any one owner to 25%. A Carlton-United merger appears certain to break the rules. This means that the competition commission could recommend lifting the 25% limit to something like 30%.

The NHS will provide all the surgeons, nurses and anaesthetists needed for operations and care will still be free for patients at the point of delivery. \"This seems to me a sensible thing to do, to allow NHS patients to get the timely care that they need,\" Mr Milburn said. Doctors' leaders and the private sector welcomed the announcement, which comes after months of negotiations between department of health officials and the independent healthcare association. Dr Mac Armstrong, secretary of the British Medical Association said: \"We have always called for the health service to use all available facilities.\" But the Conservatives accused the government of hypocrisy and claimed public spending on private healthcare had doubled since Labour came to power. The plan may anger some Labour backbenchers and health professionals who feel the founding principles of the NHS are under threat. John Austin, a Labour member of the Commons health select committee, said he had grave reservations about the scheme. When a similar plan to use state money to pay for residential care for the elderly in the private sector was introduced by the previous Conservative government, a host of homes sprang up, offering \"inferior\" care to residents, he said. \"My real fear is that once the state starts waving its cheque-book about, the private sector is there to grab the money It is a fundamental Rubicon that one should be very wary of crossing. It is a question of how you get back.\"",

      "body": "<p>The mark of a true controversialist may be the ability to lean back, fag in mouth, and shrug that there's nothing that controversial about controversy. Novelist and poet Michel Houellebecq has been hailed as France's biggest literary discovery - and source of scandal - since Camus. Not only has he sold some 300,000 copies of his second novel, Les Particulaires El\u00e9mentaires (now translated as Atomised); he has been attacked for it by both right and left, Catholics and communists, natural enemies and erstwhile allies. </p> <p>It's no big deal, he says. \"Polemical debates happen all the time in France. This was quite a big one, but any attentive reader of the French press gets bored if there isn't one every three months - it's part of the national character. I get bored with it.\" </p> <p>It is precisely because of Houellebecq's assault on the national character that his readers hold him in such reverence - or such contempt. Atomised is an ambitious dissection of the modern French social psyche that traces its malaises to the supposed annus mirabilis , 1968. Countless French fictions complain about that year's radical dreams going awry, but Houellebecq goes so far as to identify soixante-huitisme as the beginning of the end for French society. </p> <p>In Atomised, cherished ideals of left and right alike go to the wall - sexual self-fulfilment, New Age spiritualism, even such unimpeachable liberal concepts as \"human dignity\" and \"progress\". Houellebecq's compelling and often vengeful saga of modern France, enacted in the grievously disappointing lives of two half-brothers, is flavoured with a misanthropy not seen in French literature since C\u00e9line. </p> <p>The Flaubertian lucidity of Houellebecq's writing persuades you that he's something more than a venomous wind-up artist, or worse, a sort of literary Bernard Manning. Slight, shabby and 41, he hardly looks a typical French-lit cult hero. The only thing he has in common with Albert Camus is his chain-smoking. He distractedly tweaks his stringy, combed-over hair and ums and ahs barely audibly. Presumably young French readers have tired of flashy nouveaux philosophes in open-neck shirts, and decided to try a diffident po\u00e8te maudit of the old school. </p> <p>Quite apart from what Houellebecq's novels say is the way they say it: a strange, fluid blend of thinly disguised autobiography, sweeping sociological tableau and hard scientific treatise. There's nothing new about this approach, he insists. \"Balzac never hesitated to launch into his theories halfway through a book. The great advantage of a novel is you can put in whatever comes into your head - it has the same shape as the human brain.\" </p> <p>Houellebecq's approach is justified by the fact that he deals not so much with characters as with \"symptomatic individuals\" who represent their age. If human relations are breaking down, as he suggests in his first novel, Extension du Domaine de la Lutte (translated as Whatever), then the old tales of stormy passion are no longer possible: \"We're a long way from Wuthering Heights.\" </p> <p>In fact, Houellebecq insists, he's a long way from most novels' concerns. \"I describe what happens to normal people - people whom nothing special happens to.\" His characters either drift robotically through mind-numbing day jobs, obsessively pursue sexual thrills, or live lives of depressive monotony, such as Michel, the scientist in Atomised, who nevertheless makes a discovery that changes the world. \"Active people don't change the world profoundly; ideas do,\" Houellebecq says. \"Napoleon is less important in world history than Jean-Jacques Rousseau.\" </p> <p>There's a certain bitter facility in Houellebecq's satirising of bureaucracy and New Ageism alike, but where his books really hurt for many French readers is in the way they present sex as a constant source of sorrow, disappointment, even madness. But, he points out, \"Not looking for sexual satisfaction doesn't lead to a much better situation, either. People don't like the basic statement that not everyone succeeds in finding sexual satisfaction. It seems a very banal proposition to me, but that's what shocks people - the picture of losers in the sexual competition.\" </p> <p>That is not all that shocks, however. The opinions that Houellebecq airs, either through his characters or his narrative voice, often suggest, at the very least, borderline-paranoid right-wing contempt for feminism, sexual freedom and youth culture. One character even tries writing virulent racist literature, although he eventually decides it's just a silly phase he's going through. Houellebecq has been attacked as a reactionary, and Atomised got him thrown off the editorial board of the left-wing revue Perpendiculaires. </p> <p>He's no reactionary, he insists, although there's a touch of sophistry to his defence. \"A reactionary is someone who wants to return to a previous state - that's never a possibility in my books. For me, everything's irreversible in the life of a society, as well as an individual's.\" </p> <p>Reputedly a former Marxist, Houellebecq claims he never really was one, and that these days he has no political position at all. \"I don't think politics is that important. Belief systems and technological revolutions are important, but I don't think political decisions have the slightest effect on events.\" </p> <p>Both on and off the page, Houellebecq likes to offer such dry provocations, as if daring you to guess whether he really has any hard opinions at all. \"Any groups with a strong ideology - communists or Catholics - will be split for and against me. That's only normal. You couldn't agree ideologically with the whole of Atomised.\" So is he just a compulsive position-shifter, out to baffle and antagonise every possible camp? \"No, I'd much rather everyone agreed with me. But it's not up to me to make a step towards others - it's up to everyone else to come closer to me.\" </p> <p>If Houellebecq is often confused with his characters, it is partly because their biographies overlap. Born on the isle of R\u00e9union, Houellebecq, like the brothers in Atomised, was the son of parents who pursued the hippy dream in the 60s and left him with his grandparents. The prodigal mother in Atomised appears to be based on his own; when I ask if there's an element of revenge in the novel, he mutters a terse \"Yes. Definitely\". Like the hero of Whatever, he worked in computer admin, and suffered the stultifying effects of French office life. \"It's not just deep boredom. Along with the boredom, you're obliged to feign enthusiasm. That's what's really painful.\" </p> <p> Like more than one of his characters, he had several depressive spells in mental hospital, although, he claims, \"I mainly went to the psychiatrist to get time off work. The problem is, the people in the hospitals are so much more interesting that sometimes you don't want to come out again. Those places suit me rather well - they're not stressful, and you can smoke as much as you like.\" </p> <p>Houellebecq's pose of cantankerous intolerance has made him an unlikely pop-culture star. He recently released a CD, Pr\u00e9sence Humaine, on which he intones his poems Gainsbourg-style over Lou Reed-esque backing tracks. A film of Extension du Domaine de la Lutte was also released last year. Although it bombed in France (too close to the book, some complained), it is more than respectable, and features the unnerving sight of director Philippe Harel in the lead, doing a spot-on imitation of Houellebecq, nicotine fingers and all. </p> <p>Houellebecq packed in his computer job two years ago. He now lives in Dublin, and travels to Lanzarote (the setting of his next book) and Thailand (the one after that). He has also remarried, which suggests he is not entirely despondent about the possibility of love. He shrugs. \"Given a person's past, it's usually bound to end badly, but sometimes it can go right.\" </p> <p>For a seemingly retiring misanthrope, this born-again rock-star ranter seems to have taken to fame with remarkable aplomb. \"I don't suffer attacks of excessive modesty,\" he says. He admits that he has been affected by the stress of his new life. \"I'm more impatient. Before, I was calm to the point of apathy.\" So can his fans be reassured that his outlook hasn't been exactly sweetened by success? \"I don't really feel pessimistic,\" he says. \"Just realistic.\" </p> <p>Atomised is published by Heinemann, price \u00a312.99. The CD Pr\u00e9sence Humaine is on the Tricatel label. The film Whatever is released in the UK on September 1.</p>",

The Euro is brought to you in association with <a href=\"http://www.breathe.com\">www.breathe.com</a>. It's amazing what happens when you breathe.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>EUROTALK</strong></p> <p>\"I am disappointed. There are a lot of people in football who are deeply disappointed. I know a lot of chairmen will be sitting at home saying 'what have we done?\"' And not rubbing their hands saying: \"How much have we made?\". BBC Director General Greg Dyke on the loss of Premiership highlight rights to ITV.</p> <p><strong>THE EURO-TORIAL</strong></p> <p>When we switched on the telly last night to find Gary Lineker a paler shade of white, we thought he was simply perturbed at the thought of conversing with Johan Cruyff and his unique brand of English. But it wasn't the Dutch legend who shivered Gary to the core, nor the prospect of Barry Davies confusing Francesco Totti with Francesco Toldo again. No, the BBC's anchor was pallid because he'll be out of a job in a year.</p> <p>The imminent demise of Match of the Day after ITV outbid the BBC for the rights to Premiership highlights by \u00a320m a year is not really related to the progress of Euro 2000. Although it would be fun to see Gary and Alan chain themselves to their moodily-lit desk and sing protest songs throughout the Germany game. But the loss of the BBC's flagship sports programme means the end of an era in football broadcasting and the way the game is covered is likely to change forever.</p> <p>However much money ITV may throw at pinching presenters from the BBC - Des, Bob Wilson, Terry Venables, Ally McCoist - they are never the same amidst the adverts or the deliberately lightweight approach to coverage (\"Just how important is David Beckham to England Ally?\"). And, as far as Sky is concerned, it is probably better if we didn't dwell for too long on the in-house promotions scheme that passes for their sports coverage.</p> <p>The simple fact of the matter is that, even during this current tournament, the BBC is the only place to offer thoughtful football coverage, and still the only station that will admit a game is bad (or, as in the case of the Germany Romania game, positively revel in it). From August 2001 there will be no more of that, and lots more of Gary Newbon. It's a national disaster.</p> <p> <strong>SO, FAREWELL THEN (how the papers view the Beeb's loss)</strong></p> <p>\"A national institution has been lost and everyone is gutted. Everybody was told it was a 99 per cent certainty that we would keep Match of the Day.\" Alan Hansen in the Daily Express.</p> <p>\"I thought the BBC would think whatever happened in the world, they'd find enough money to keep Match of the Day. Even if they had to abandon a few dramas... no, make that ALL of their dramas.' Des Lynam offers unbiased analysis in the Mirror.</p> <p>\"This is exactly why the BBC's new boss, Greg Dyke deserves praise. He decided not to spend a fortune of YOUR money keeping Match of the Day at the Beeb. He put in a low bid and must have known ITV would top it. This was a brave decision by a good man.\" The Sun offers distinctly faint praise to the BBC's director general.</p> <p>\"So, farewell Match of the Day. Possibly the six most distressing words I have ever had to write.\" Brian Viner, the Independent.</p> <p>\"Our Match of the Days are numbered and Saturdays will never be the same again.\" Paul Kelso, the Guardian.</p> <p>\"It is the sign of a department curling up its toes and preparing to shuffle into oblivion.

      "bodyText": "* * * * * * * * * * * * * A MESSAGE FROM OUR SPONSOR Play football, see football, talk football, breathe football. The Euro is brought to you in association with www.breathe.com. It's amazing what happens when you breathe. * * * * * * * * * * * * * EUROTALK \"I am disappointed. There are a lot of people in football who are deeply disappointed. I know a lot of chairmen will be sitting at home saying 'what have we done?\"' And not rubbing their hands saying: \"How much have we made?\". BBC Director General Greg Dyke on the loss of Premiership highlight rights to ITV. THE EURO-TORIAL When we switched on the telly last night to find Gary Lineker a paler shade of white, we thought he was simply perturbed at the thought of conversing with Johan Cruyff and his unique brand of English. But it wasn't the Dutch legend who shivered Gary to the core, nor the prospect of Barry Davies confusing Francesco Totti with Francesco Toldo again. No, the BBC's anchor was pallid because he'll be out of a job in a year. The imminent demise of Match of the Day after ITV outbid the BBC for the rights to Premiership highlights by \u00a320m a year is not really related to the progress of Euro 2000. Although it would be fun to see Gary and Alan chain themselves to their moodily-lit desk and sing protest songs throughout the Germany game. But the loss of the BBC's flagship sports programme means the end of an era in football broadcasting and the way the game is covered is likely to change forever. However much money ITV may throw at pinching presenters from the BBC - Des, Bob Wilson, Terry Venables, Ally McCoist - they are never the same amidst the adverts or the deliberately lightweight approach to coverage (\"Just how important is David Beckham to England Ally?\"). And, as far as Sky is concerned, it is probably better if we didn't dwell for too long on the in-house promotions scheme that passes for their sports coverage. The simple fact of the matter is that, even during this current tournament, the BBC is the only place to offer thoughtful football coverage, and still the only station that will admit a game is bad (or, as in the case of the Germany Romania game, positively revel in it). From August 2001 there will be no more of that, and lots more of Gary Newbon. It's a national disaster. SO, FAREWELL THEN (how the papers view the Beeb's loss) \"A national institution has been lost and everyone is gutted. Everybody was told it was a 99 per cent certainty that we would keep Match of the Day.\" Alan Hansen in the Daily Express. \"I thought the BBC would think whatever happened in the world, they'd find enough money to keep Match of the Day. Even if they had to abandon a few dramas... no, make that ALL of their dramas.' Des Lynam offers unbiased analysis in the Mirror. \"This is exactly why the BBC's new boss, Greg Dyke deserves praise. He decided not to spend a fortune of YOUR money keeping Match of the Day at the Beeb. He put in a low bid and must have known ITV would top it. This was a brave decision by a good man.\" The Sun offers distinctly faint praise to the BBC's director general. \"So, farewell Match of the Day. Possibly the six most distressing words I have ever had to write.\" Brian Viner, the Independent. \"Our Match of the Days are numbered and Saturdays will never be the same again.\" Paul Kelso, the Guardian. \"It is the sign of a department curling up its toes and preparing to shuffle into oblivion. Here lies BBC Sport.' Martin Samuel in the Daily Express * * * * * * * * * * * * * A MESSAGE FROM BREATHE.COM Euro 2000. Big screen sport action. In a pub. With your mates. And \u00a3200 behind the bar. perfect. Win a \u00a3200 bar tab for Euro 2000 at www.breathe.com * * * * * * * * * * * * * EURONEWS Oliver Bierhoff will miss the crucial match between Germany and England on Saturday after sustaining a calf injury in training. \"I was standing when I felt a knock on my calf,\" he said. \"It was like I was hit by a stone.\" The stone immediately distanced himself from the incident. \"Hit him? I don't know what he's talking about, I was sitting on the floor\" the inanimate object said. \"He's a liar that Bierhoff and you can tell anyone I said that.\" The FA will call an emergency meeting if England draw Turkey in the quarter-finals of Euro 2000. The English and Turkish footballing authorities have already had preliminary discussions on how to avoid trouble between rival supporters. The most viable plan suggested so far is that neither side qualifies for the quarters and both go home instead. EURORUMOUR with KAREL POBORSKY Heh heh. Mmmm. Hallo my pretty ones, it is I, skinny Vladimir Smicer. I have put Karel Poborsky in a cage. Would you like some bread Karel? Well you can't have any. Not until I have finished my experiments. Now while I power up my generator I will take the time to tell you today's transfer tales. Heh heh. HUMMMMMMMMMMM Liverpool want to bring Dutch wing-back Boudewijn Zenden to Anfield. The Barcelona man could be one of many Dutchmen to leave the club this summer and would cost Gerard Houllier \u00a36m. Aston Villa are set to sign former French international David Ginola for \u00a33m. According to this morning's papers Villa boss John Gregory has been given permission to talk to the player by Spurs chairman Alan Sugar. HUMMMMMMMMMMM That is all.

Then it tested three kinds of literacy ability to cope with prose, documents and quantity. Britain's worst showing was in quantitative literacy, coming 16th out of 22 - some countries like Switzerland were split into different language-speaking regions. Britain did fairly well at the highest level of quantitative literacy but had more citizens than some other countries in the \"can only cope with simple material\" category. The only nations which did worse were Hungary, Ireland, Slovenia, Poland, Portugal and Chile. Germany came fifth, behind Sweden, Denmark, Norway and the Czech republic. Britain's second worst performance was 15th out of 22 at document literacy. Again the three main Nordic countries were top, followed by the Netherlands, Finland, Belgium (Flanders), Germany, the Czech republic, Canada, Australia, Switzerland (French), Switzerland (German), Switzerland (Italian) and the US. Trailing Britain were New Zealand, Ireland, Hungary, Slovenia, Poland, Portugal and Chile. Britain's highest place, as the country of William Hazlitt and George Orwell, was in prose literacy, where it came 13th, ahead of Ireland, the Czech republic, Switzerland (Italian and German), Hungary, Slovenia, Portugal, Poland and Chile. It was behind, again, the main Nordic countries, the Netherlands, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the US, Belgium (Flanders), Germany and Switzerland (French). In all three measures of literacy, Britain did well in the top bands of \"higher-order skills\" but was betrayed by high numbers among the less skilled. It was also 13th in the league table of people who say they read a book at least once a month. It scored 60%, compared with 65% in the two leading countries, New Zealand and the Czech republic. Ireland, though low-scoring elsewhere in the survey, was equal third with Germany among book readers. The nations which read fewer books than the British were the Netherlands. Poland, Slovenia, Norway, Chile, Belgium (Flanders) and Portugal (with about 22%). Britain's highest place in the 205-page study came in a table of countries with steep unemployment rates among people with very poor literacy skills. It was fourth, beaten in its number of unemployed in this category only by Ireland, Finland and Belgium (Flanders). Countries with lowest proportions of unskilled unemployed were Switzerland, Norway, the US and the Czech republic. Overall, Britain's performance put it among 14 countries where \"at least 15% of adults have literacy skills at only the most rudimentary level - making it difficult for them to cope with the rising skill demands of the information age\", the report said. The minority of six countries with fewer than 15% in this category were Denmark, Finland, Germany, Netherlands, Norway and Sweden. But even in Sweden, the best scorer with only 8%, there was \"a severe literacy deficit in everyday life and work\". Literacy in the Age of Information, Final Report, OECD, Paris 2000 ($31).

      "body": "<p>After two sessions of torment, England clawed their way back into the first Test after tea yesterday but already it may not be enough to save them. </p> <p>Bowled out for 179 in overcast conditions exploited beautifully by the West Indian bowlers, England needed early wickets in the 19 overs remaining. They managed two, with Chris Gayle, the latest in a long line of openers in recent years, dropped by Andy Flintoff at fourth slip off Andy Caddick but then lbw to Darren Gough without scoring, and Wavell Hinds, suffering perhaps from a surfeit of confidence, striking two outrageous boundaries before driving Caddick head-high to Nasser Hussain at wide mid-off. </p> <p>Significantly, though, Brian Lara was able to play untroubled through the final dozen overs and England needed his wicket above all. With the weather set fair today, he may make them pay. </p> <p>For two decades batsmen facing West Indies bowling underwent trial by fire, a withering barrage delivered uncompromisingly at searing pace. But the preferred method of torture now is the death of a thousand cuts. For raw, sometimes wild pace, substitute old-fashioned virtues of relentless length and unwavering line delivered with the patience of a Tibetan monk. West Indies play a waiting game now in these conditions, challenging the opposition not to crack first. </p> <p>Yesterday belonged to Courtney Walsh, 37 years young, who bowled unchanged through the first two-hour session as if he was taking his morning constitution, making early inroads into the England innings, and by the finish had taken his personal test-match tally to 454 wickets with figures of five for 36. England dietary experts should immediately investigate whatever cocktail of vitamins he must be taking to remain this skittish. </p> <p>Nor was there any respite at the other end, where Curtly Ambrose dropped his first delivery bang on a length and scarcely deviated from that all day. His single wicket was scant reward for the quality of his performance. </p> <p>The young pretenders Franklyn Rose and Reon King have learned their craft well from the old masters, losing composure only when the England tail was wagging. </p> <p>England lost the toss. It can be a difficult decision here, as Hussain said on Wednesday, with early movement offset by uneven bounce later in the match, but any cloud cover was due yesterday with the weekend apparently set for a heatwave: bowling first had to be the option and Jimmy Adams duly took it. </p> <p>For the best part of an hour, as Walsh trotted off some ring-rust (neither he nor Ambrose had bowled a competitive ball on the tour), Mike Atherton and Mark Ramprakash, declared fit, made slow but largely untroubled progress in hazy sunshine. </p> <p>Then the cloud rolled in and the game changed. Ramprakash was the first to notice it, for having just hit Walsh sweetly to the long-on boundary he received three deliveries in the same over that cut back alarmingly and bounced over his middle stump. </p> <p>In Walsh's next over, Ramprakash pushed forward and was caught at short leg and batting was never the same again. </p> <p>Atherton, stuck on two for three-quarters of an hour as Ambrose pinned him down, gained some respite with the advent of King, hooking him hard, but then received a legcutter from Walsh which he touched to the wicketkeeper. Then, with lunch still half an hour off, Graeme Hick drove stiffly off the back foot and edged hard to third slip, with Sherwin Campbell at second diving to catch the rebound. </p> <p>As tea approached, the heavy work had been completed, or so West Indies might have thought. Alec Stewart had been tucked up by Ambrose's movement into him and finally edged on to his stumps; Nasser Hussain, who has barely topped 100 runs in first-class cricket this season, received a snorter from Rose which flicked his glove; Nick Knight survived a nervy start to play as comfortably as anyone for his 26, sensibly looking for singles where others had become locked into survival, before hanging his bat tamely outside off stump; and Flintoff, after a couple of beefy blows, did likewise. Thus far in his career he is a big disappointment. </p> <p>The revival, such as it was, was begun by Robert Croft, whose last test innings in England was his marathon match-saving effort against South Africa at Old Trafford two years ago. Some sensible counterpunching, including a top-notch back-foot cover drive, brought him four boundaries before he became Walsh's fifth victim. No dis grace here: the ball was a fast leg break. </p> <p>Now came the best stand of the innings, with Andy Caddick digging in and Darren Gough at last displaying the flair that promised so much when he first burst on to the international scene. </p> <p>Gough hit four boundaries, adding 39 for the ninth wicket before he was run out, by a whisker, as Ridley Jacobs hit the bowler's wicket with a direct throw. Not since he made a half-century against Australia in his seventh test has the Yorkshireman scored more than the 23 he made yesterday. </p> <p>Caddick, who also hit four boundaries, was left unbeaten on 21 when Ed Giddins top-edged and was caught. </p> <p><strong> Scoreboard</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> ENGLAND </strong> <strong> First Innings </strong></p> <p><strong>M A Atherton</strong> c Jacobs b Walsh <strong> 20</strong> </p> <p> Pushed at jagging delivery 82mins 51 balls 4 fours </p> <p><strong> M R Ramprakash</strong> c Hinds b Walsh <strong> 18</strong> </p> <p> Inside edge onto pad to short leg 61mins 48 balls 4 fours </p> <p><strong> *N Hussain</strong> c Jacobs b Rose <strong> 15</strong> </p> <p> Gloved, trying to withdraw 121mins 82 balls 2 fours </p> <p><strong> G A Hick</strong> c Campbell b Walsh <strong> 0</strong> </p> <p> Knocked on from third slip to second 9mins 6 balls </p> <p><strong> A J Stewart</strong> b Ambrose <strong> 6</strong> </p> <p> Inside edge onto stumps 39mins 25 balls </p> <p><strong> N V Knight</strong> c Lara b King <strong> 26</strong> </p> <p> Edged drive at short ball to first slip 84mins 56 balls 4 fours </p> <p><strong> A Flintoff</strong> c Lara b Walsh <strong> 16</strong> </p> <p> Angled push to first slip 40mins 20 balls 3 fours </p> <p><strong> R D B Croft</strong> c Jacobs b Walsh <strong> 18</strong> </p> <p> Edged delivery that held up 32mins 19 balls 4 fours </p> <p><strong> A R Caddick</strong> not out <strong> 21</strong> </p> <p> 94mins 67 balls </p> <p><strong> D Gough</strong> run out <strong> 23</strong> </p> <p> Hesitated over leg-bye to wicketkeeper 50mins 36 balls 4 fours </p> <p><strong> E S H Giddins</strong> c Jacobs b King <strong> 0</strong> </p> <p> Skied ambitious hook 14mins 11 balls </p> <p><strong> Extras</strong> (lb6, w1, nb9) <strong> 16 </strong></p> <p><strong>Total</strong> (69 overs) <strong> 179 </strong></p> <p><strong>Fall:</strong> 26, 44, 45, 57, 82, 112, 112, 134, 173. </p> <p><strong> Bowling:</strong> Ambrose 20.5-10-32-1; Walsh 21-9-36-5; King 14.1-2-60-2; Rose 13-3-45-1. </p> <p><strong> WEST INDIES </strong> <strong> First Innings </strong></p> <p><strong>S L Campbell</strong> not out <strong> 28</strong> </p> <p> 80mins 60 balls 3 fours </p> <p><strong> C H Gayle</strong> lbw b Gough <strong> 0</strong> </p> <p> Cut back into left-hander 14mins 8 balls </p> <p><strong> W W Hinds</strong> c Hussain b Caddick <strong> 12</strong> </p> <p> Drove to mid-off 20mins 11 balls </p> <p><strong> B C Lara</strong> not out <strong> 6</strong> </p> <p> 46mins 36 balls </p> <p><strong> Extras</strong> (lb3, nb1) <strong> 4 </strong></p> <p><strong>Total</strong> (for 2, 19 overs) <strong> 50 </strong></p> <p><strong>Fall:</strong> 5, 24. </p> <p><strong> To bat:</strong> S Chanderpaul, *J C Adams, R D Jacobs, F A Rose, C E L Ambrose, R D King, C A Walsh. </p> <p><strong> Bowling:</strong> Gough 8-2-20-1; Caddick 6-2-14-1; Giddins 3-1-12-0; Croft 2-1-1-0.</p>",

George Trofimoff, 73, who served as a colonel in the US army reserves, was arrested at a hotel in Tampa, Florida, after meeting an FBI agent posing as a Russian operative delivering a payment. He was charged with 32 acts of espionage on behalf of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact over a 25-year period in which he had daily access to some of the most sensitive spying secrets of the cold war. Mr Trofimoff, who was born in Germany to Russian parents and became a naturalised US citizen in 1951, spent 25 years as the US army's top civilian official at the Nuremberg joint interrogation centre in Germany. The post gave him continual access to the interrogation records of Soviet and east European refugees and defectors. Federal prosecutor Donna Bucella said that Mr Trofimoff had been indicted by a Florida grand jury yesterday and remained in custody. \"He is the highest rank United States military officer ever charged with espionage,\" she confirmed. Mr Trofimoff was paid by the KGB for providing information to the Soviet Union, Ms Bucella said. Frank Gallagher, the agent in charge of the FBI's Tampa office, said Mr Trofimoff was paid $250,000 (\u00a3160,000) over the course of his spying career. He also received the Order of the Red Banner, a Soviet award presented for bravery and self-sacrifice in defence of the socialist homeland, prosecutors said. The information revealed was more than enough to paint a picture of cold war intrigue fully worthy of a John Le Carr\u00e9 novel. Mr Trofimoff was said to have been recruited to work for the KGB by a senior member of the Russian Orthodox church in the German speaking world. His recruiter, named as Igor Vladimirovich Susemihl, also the son of Russian emigrants, was a lifetime friend who became an Orthodox priest in Bavaria and Austria. With his help, Mr Trofimoff was said to have passed details of priceless cold war military and espionage secrets to Moscow. The authorities allege the conspiracy lasted from 1969, when Mr Trofimoff became chief of the Nuremberg unit, to 1994, just before he retired. Mr Trofimoff had access to \"all classified information\" in the unit, including detailed Soviet and Warsaw pact battle plans. But the crown jewel was that he was able to give the Soviet Union a detailed briefing on the stories and secrets offered to the west by Russian emigres and defectors, in effect giving Moscow a secret window on US defence and counter-intelligence thinking. Mr Trofimoff had recently worked bagging groceries at a supermarket, a department of justice official said. A hearing was due to take place yesterday.",

      "bodyText": "The tobacco industry came under fire yesterday from Westminster and Strasbourg as members of both parliaments criticised the use of terms such as low tar, light and low nicotine, which give smokers a false sense of security. MPs demanded tougher statutory controls over the tobacco industry - including the creation of a Tobacco Regulatory Authority - to police companies and carry out further scientific research. At the same time, Euro MPs voted to ban manufacturers from using \"misleading terms\" such as light and mild and demanded that the size of health warnings be increased. The proposals need the backing of EU health ministers, who are due to consider the anti-smoking measures on June 29 and are likely to face vociferous lobbying from the tobacco industry. But the EU health commissioner, David Byrne, predicted that ministers would endorse the European Parliament's views and said an overall \"consensus on the future approach to tobacco products\" was close. In Westminster, a report on the risks of smoking by the Commons health select committee accused firms and their agencies of \"conniving\" to get round existing restrictions and challenged the government to set higher targets to eradicate the habit. Ministers were urged to re gard nicotine as comparable to hard drugs, such as heroin and cocaine, when drawing up anti-smoking strategies. David Hinchliffe, the committee's chairman, said smoking was \"a public health scandal of epidemic proportions\" that killed 120,000 people a year in Britain. The damage caused by cigarettes had been known since at least the 1950s but tobacco companies denied it and sponsored counter claims. The Tobacco Regulatory Authority, modelled on the Food Standards Agency, would, he said, be able to take on what is a well-funded and powerful lobby. Tobacco companies delayed the imposition last year of an advertising ban and the European Court of Justice's advocate-general will today give his opinion. Stephen Byers, the trade and industry secretary, is considering a recommendation to order an investigation into allegations that London-based British American Tobacco (BAT), the world's second biggest tobacco company, actively encouraged and profited from international smuggling. The allegations, made in the Guardian this year, were contested by BAT, which set up an internal investigation as well as hiring lawyers in the UK and US to prepare a defence. MPs decided the \"extremely serious\" allegations warranted an independent inquiry by inspectors from the Department of Trade and Industry. The report said: \"If they prove to be substantiated, the case for criminal proceedings against BAT should be considered; if they prove to be false, then those perpetrating them should publicly apologise to BAT for what will have amounted to a malicious slur on the company's name.\" Mr Byers is known to be \"sympathetic\" to an inquiry but BAT is lobbying against it and some senior officials in his department fear it could open a can of worms. The report, agreed unanimously by MPs, called for the appointment of more customs officers to halt the \u00a32.5bn smuggling of ciga rettes into Britain, rejecting company pleas for taxes to be reduced. \"We do not believe it would be appropriate for health policy to be shaped by the activities of criminal gangs,\" it said. It also proposed the introduction of plain boxes to undermine marketing, with larger health warnings, lists of additives and anti-smoking telephone hotline numbers printed on the cartons. A ban on terms such as light, ultra-mild, low tar and low nicotine was also recommended to stop smokers thinking they could light up safely. Yvette Cooper, minister for public health, said: \"I welcome this report. It shows clearly, as we have said, that when it comes to the tobacco industry voluntary agreements just don't work. \"That is why we are legislating to ban tobacco advertising and achieve tighter regulation at the European level.\" BAT agreed to make the results of its internal investigation into the international smuggling allegations available to the committee. John Carlisle, of the Tobacco Manufacturers' Association, said the committee was indulging in a \"bashing exercise\" - \"in particular, accusations against us that we're not regulated - we are highly regulated.\"",

      "bodyText": "Nail bomber David Copeland is a paranoid schizophrenic who believed that he would be rescued from his trial by God and thought he was being punished like Jesus before his death, the Old Bailey heard yesterday. Even if this did not happen, he was confident that he would be free within five years when Tony Blair was replaced by an extreme rightwing government whose first act would be to release him from prison, the jury was told. Opening his defence yesterday, his counsel Michael Wolkind QC said that psychiatrists would give evidence that Copeland was suffering from \"religious, grandiose, persecutory delusions\" which contributed to the reasons for his behaviour. \"We say he was suffering from diminished responsibility. He was turned into a robot, his illness obsessed him,\" he told the court. The witnesses will include the medical director of Broadmoor special hospital in Berkshire, where Copeland is being held. The 24-year-old engineering assistant from Cove, Hampshire, has pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of Andrea Dykes, John Light and Nik Moore in the Soho pub explosion which was the culmination of his bombing campaign in April last year. The crown is rejecting these pleas, made on the grounds of diminished responsibility, and is seeking convictions for murder. Both defence and prosecution psychiatrists consider Copeland unfit to give evidence, the court heard yesterday, as details were given of his state of mind and key episodes from his childhood and adolescence. First to give evidence was psychiatrist Paul Gilluley, who interviewed Copeland at Belmarsh prison in south-east London and at Broadmoor. Copeland considered himself a heterosexual, but had in the past wondered whether he was homosexual, the psychiatrist said. The bomber denied ever having a homosexual physical relationship. Copeland, whose father Stephen sat listening behind the defence benches yesterday, told the psychiatrist that his parents \"turned funny\" when he was 13 and had made suggestions that he was homosexual. Dr Gilluley said: \"It was following an incident when he walked into the house and his parents were singing the theme tune to The Flintstones, with emphasis on the words 'have a gay old time'. \"His mother was constantly asking him if 'there's anything you want to tell us' - which he interpreted as suggesting he was homosexual. \"He said he had never confronted these issues with his parents.\" Dr Gilluley said that Copeland was suffering from a \"delusional belief system with grandiose and messianic elements\". This included the belief that he was a prophet chosen by God for a special mission, which was to be the spark for racial wars in Britain. Earlier Mr Wolkind urged the jury to set aside the emotions and opinions of \"the man in the street and the man in the pub\". He said that rows of victims had sat at the back of the court during Copeland's trial \"and not a single one need ever forgive him for what he has done\". He told the jurors: \"You must be straining to deliver him justice. \"On the streets, just like the streets of Brixton and Brick Lane and in pubs like Soho ordinary people probably have a good idea of the justice he deserves.\" Mr Wolkind referred to Copeland's belief that killers deserved the death penalty, before saying: \"But you are no longer ordinary people. You confirmed - each of you - that you were able dispassionately to judge, and reach a verdict on the evidence.\" The trial continues.",

And, so many years after Camp David, relations between Egypt and Israel are still cool.</p> <p>For Yasser Arafat the years since 1993 have brought a series of humiliations and betrayals at the hands of the Israelis. His handshake with Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin has made no difference to the impoverished lives of ordinary Palestinians. The process has been so grim that Arafat has threatened to abandon it and declare Palestinian statehood even without East Jerusalem. Peace with Israel is a bitter pill.</p> <p>The trouble for Bashar al-Assad is that he has no choice but to swallow. The only question is when. Ehud Barak has sensibly brought home his soldiers from the Lebanese minefield, thus reducing Syria's leverage. And yet his support in Israel's parliament, the Knesset, has crumbled. Peace with Syria is the only prize which can restore his prestige.</p> <p>As the self-appointed successor to Rabin, Barak has had the courage to admit that, before his death, Rabin guaranteed Assad that Israel would withdraw from the Golan Heights in exchange for Syrian security commitments.</p> <p>And it is that issue of security which will now be uppermost in Bashar al-Assad's mind. He faces a dilemma. He presides over a security state. There are half a dozen branches of military and civilian intelligence snooping on Syria's citizens. The Syrian army is still large and has 35,000 men in Lebanon as well as forts and listening posts. Without his father's prestige and fearsome reputation, Bashar dare not seem weak. He cannot give too much away to Israel. After all, his own father came to power through a military coup. Toughing it out would allow Bashar to build his credit with Arab nationalists and Islamists. It would also give him time to entrench.</p> <p>Sadly he may not have the time. Even his father saw that Syria would not stick in its obsessive-compulsive rut. Without Soviet payola the country will keep going from bad to awful. Bashar must make peace to bring much needed investment. If he does not, another revolt could break out - like those his father so ruthlessly put down in the early 80s.</p> <p>There is, however, a shaft of hope in all this gloom. The distance, literally and metaphorically, between the Israeli and Syrian positions is small. The Syrians can no longer claim that peace with Israel would crack a united Arab front. Hafez al-Assad had already offered \"full peace for full withdrawal\". In the context of the Golan Heights does that refer to Syria's 1923 border, as the Israelis would prefer? Or to the 1949 armistice line, which would give Syria land on both the north-eastern and south-eastern shores of the Sea of Galilee? Or to the military lines at the end of the 1967 war, a compromise position? As long as both sides gain access to precious water resources, the negotiations can decide.</p> <p>Assad's death will have made Syria jumpy. But Barak must remember Bashar's need for a peace with dignity. And in an age of laser guided missiles, returning the Heights will not compromise Israel's security.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",

And it is that issue of security which will now be uppermost in Bashar al-Assad's mind. He faces a dilemma. He presides over a security state. There are half a dozen branches of military and civilian intelligence snooping on Syria's citizens. The Syrian army is still large and has 35,000 men in Lebanon as well as forts and listening posts. Without his father's prestige and fearsome reputation, Bashar dare not seem weak. He cannot give too much away to Israel. After all, his own father came to power through a military coup. Toughing it out would allow Bashar to build his credit with Arab nationalists and Islamists. It would also give him time to entrench. Sadly he may not have the time. Even his father saw that Syria would not stick in its obsessive-compulsive rut. Without Soviet payola the country will keep going from bad to awful. Bashar must make peace to bring much needed investment. If he does not, another revolt could break out - like those his father so ruthlessly put down in the early 80s. There is, however, a shaft of hope in all this gloom. The distance, literally and metaphorically, between the Israeli and Syrian positions is small. The Syrians can no longer claim that peace with Israel would crack a united Arab front. Hafez al-Assad had already offered \"full peace for full withdrawal\". In the context of the Golan Heights does that refer to Syria's 1923 border, as the Israelis would prefer? Or to the 1949 armistice line, which would give Syria land on both the north-eastern and south-eastern shores of the Sea of Galilee? Or to the military lines at the end of the 1967 war, a compromise position? As long as both sides gain access to precious water resources, the negotiations can decide. Assad's death will have made Syria jumpy. But Barak must remember Bashar's need for a peace with dignity. And in an age of laser guided missiles, returning the Heights will not compromise Israel's security. comment@theguardian.com",

      "body": "<p>Greg Dyke was so determined that the BBC should retain the rights to show English Premiership football highlights that he sanctioned a bid worth twice as much as its present deal: it was as much as the corporation could afford, he pleaded last night. </p> <p>Over champagne at ITV network headquarters in London, jubilant executives could not contain their delight that his gamble had failed in such a calamitous fashion. </p> <p>Across town at White City, BBC chiefs were in shock as the enormity of loss began to sink in. </p> <p>\"Match of the Day is the biggest, most successful football programme on television and we are determined to keep in that way,\" the BBC had said a few hours before the result of the bidding was announced. </p> <p>Losing such a fixture of the sports schedule is nothing short of disastrous. </p> <p>When he took up his post earlier this year, Mr Dyke promised to stem the growing tide of BBC Sport losses. His failure to secure Premiership highlights rights is a huge blow to the corporation and its staff, who thought that if anyone could stop the rot, Mr Dyke could. </p> <p>Morale, already low at BBC Sport, is now in free fall. Summing up the sense of disbelief that such new depths could have been plumbed, BBC commentator Barry Davies said just before going on air at the Euro 2000 championships last night: \"It's the end of an era - again.\" </p> <p>The decline of BBC Sport began with the loss of formula one to ITV, and continued with the loss of Test cricket to Sky and Channel 4. </p> <p>One by one, major sporting events slipped out of the corporation's grasp: the FA Cup final, six nations rugby, British Lions tours, Cheltenham Gold Cup racing, and Ryder Cup golf. </p> <p>On radio, international cricket went to Talksport. Only Radio 5 Live could lay claim to a comprehensive portfolio of sports rights. </p> <p>\"It's a body blow,\" said Sir Paul Fox, a former BBC managing director. \"It is the biggest blow that BBC Sport has suffered. Saturday night's Match of the Day has seemingly gone on forever and I suppose money is a major factor.\" </p> <p>There is no doubt that the BBC's bid was an impressive one - \u00a3120m over three years. But, quite simply, ITV has bigger pockets, and it dug deep. After years as an also-ran in the sports broadcasting stakes, Britain's most-watched broadcaster is now a significant player. </p> <p>So viewers of the national game will have to get used to a switch in viewing habits over the next few years. </p> <p>From the 2001-2 season, ITV will screen a highlights programme on Saturday and Sunday nights. It is expected that the network's star presenter, the former BBC man Des Lynam, will front at least one of the shows. </p> <p>Sky will continue to screen the main Premiership matches live: a total of 66 live games on Sunday afternoons and Monday evenings will be shown on the satellite network.

      "bodyText": "Greg Dyke was so determined that the BBC should retain the rights to show English Premiership football highlights that he sanctioned a bid worth twice as much as its present deal: it was as much as the corporation could afford, he pleaded last night. Over champagne at ITV network headquarters in London, jubilant executives could not contain their delight that his gamble had failed in such a calamitous fashion. Across town at White City, BBC chiefs were in shock as the enormity of loss began to sink in. \"Match of the Day is the biggest, most successful football programme on television and we are determined to keep in that way,\" the BBC had said a few hours before the result of the bidding was announced. Losing such a fixture of the sports schedule is nothing short of disastrous. When he took up his post earlier this year, Mr Dyke promised to stem the growing tide of BBC Sport losses. His failure to secure Premiership highlights rights is a huge blow to the corporation and its staff, who thought that if anyone could stop the rot, Mr Dyke could. Morale, already low at BBC Sport, is now in free fall. Summing up the sense of disbelief that such new depths could have been plumbed, BBC commentator Barry Davies said just before going on air at the Euro 2000 championships last night: \"It's the end of an era - again.\" The decline of BBC Sport began with the loss of formula one to ITV, and continued with the loss of Test cricket to Sky and Channel 4. One by one, major sporting events slipped out of the corporation's grasp: the FA Cup final, six nations rugby, British Lions tours, Cheltenham Gold Cup racing, and Ryder Cup golf. On radio, international cricket went to Talksport. Only Radio 5 Live could lay claim to a comprehensive portfolio of sports rights. \"It's a body blow,\" said Sir Paul Fox, a former BBC managing director. \"It is the biggest blow that BBC Sport has suffered. Saturday night's Match of the Day has seemingly gone on forever and I suppose money is a major factor.\" There is no doubt that the BBC's bid was an impressive one - \u00a3120m over three years. But, quite simply, ITV has bigger pockets, and it dug deep. After years as an also-ran in the sports broadcasting stakes, Britain's most-watched broadcaster is now a significant player. So viewers of the national game will have to get used to a switch in viewing habits over the next few years. From the 2001-2 season, ITV will screen a highlights programme on Saturday and Sunday nights. It is expected that the network's star presenter, the former BBC man Des Lynam, will front at least one of the shows. Sky will continue to screen the main Premiership matches live: a total of 66 live games on Sunday afternoons and Monday evenings will be shown on the satellite network. It will also have the right to broadcast a highlights programme on Sunday mornings. The deal is a huge relief to Sky: live football is the reason it exists. In a revolution for British television viewers, the cable operator NTL has won the right to televise 40 Premier League matches live, on a pay per view basis. NTL said last night that it would show matches on 37 consecutive Sunday afternoons, not conflicting with the live rights package matches. The remaining three matches will be shown on bank holidays or mid-week. NTL intends to offer its matches to rivals as well as to its own 2m subscribers, so that Sky Digital viewers, for example, could opt to pay for an NTL match. The NTL deal is also something of a relief to employees at BBC Sport, who will produce the matches for the cable giant. In addition, Premiership clubs will be able to show their own matches on a delayed basis on their in-house TV channels, such as Manchester United's MUTV, and on their internet sites after midnight on Mondays. Rights to will also be awarded on an experimental basis for video on demand services and new generation mobile phones, both of which are expected to explode in popularity over the next few years. In every sense, the 2000 Premier League deal has heralded a brave and somewhat complicated new world for fans of English Premiership football. It is a world, however, which the BBC will only watch from the touchline.",

One of the things that concerns me most is that it has been grossly exaggerated. \"Many of the errors in diagnoses or disagreements in diagnoses were not cancerous patients. There were only seven where there was serious consequence from the incorrect diagnosis.\" He said he was working as a locum not for the money but because he enjoyed it.",

While record industry executives had predicted internet users would be able to plunder 1m files of music by the end of this year, 25m already exist on known music-sharing sites. The cost to artists and record companies is as yet unquantifiable, but with an estimated 9bn songs being traded this year, and 1bn downloaded in 1999, it looks set to cost billions of pounds a year, the record industry yesterday warned. The picture of a world in which web users can avoid paying \u00a313.99 for a CD just by logging on to sites such as the one offering the controversial computer programme Napster was painted at a press conference in London by the body representing the recording industry worldwide, the IFPI. It called on governments to modernise their laws to crack down on pirates flouting intellectual copyright on the internet. While the record industry and the rock group Metallica are embroiled in legal battles with Napster, there is no international law prohibiting the copying of music on the net. Individual countries are updating their legislation. America has already done so, and the 15 member states of the EU are expected to adopt a directive later this year.

There were cheers from the public gallery as the jury returned its verdicts after four hours of deliberation at Newcastle crown court. Colin Bainbridge, 35, a trusted family friend, was found guilty of raping and murdering Laura at his home in Murton, County Durham, last August, after luring her away from her home. He claimed she had died after an innocent game of Cowboys and Indians had gone tragically wrong. Bainbridge, had been working at the Kane home in Penshaw, near Sunderland, on the day he abducted her. He took Laura to his house, then raped and murdered her before burying her body under the living room floor and going out for a drink with Laura's mother Carol. Her body lay undetected for 10 days - and Bainbridge kept in regular touch with Laura's anguished family during the search. Detective Superintendent Steve Bolam, of Northumbria Police, who led the inquiry, described Bainbridge as a Walter Mitty character who lied to numerous people to gain their friendship. \"I think that he took Laura away with a sexual motive and once that had taken place he killed her to hide his tracks,\" he said. \"He continued life as normal which shows how cold and calculating he was.\" Bainbridge sat impassively in the dock as the jury returned its verdicts. Laura's friends and family cheered and wept in the public gallery, also crying for Laura's grandfather who died on Tuesday. When Laura, who was described by friends as \"outgoing and friendly\", went missing in August last year, it prompted a huge police operation. During the search Bainbridge was questioned by police several times because he had been plastering an attic room at the Kane home shortly before she disappeared. He persistently lied to police officers until 10 days after her disappearance he was arrested and Laura's partly decomposed body was found under the floorboards of his living room. Bainbridge - whose girlfriend of nine years had recently given birth to a son - admitted to police she had died at his home but said that it was an accident. She suffocated while bound and gagged during an innocent game of Cowboys and Indians, he claimed. On the eighth day of the trial the jury returned a unanimous verdict on a charge of murder and a majority verdict on the charge of rape. Mr Justice Nelson reserved sentence until Monday after stating the case was one in which he would need to consider imposing a recommendation on how long Bainbridge should serve before being considered for release. Speaking outside the court Mrs Kane told reporters: \"I think that the jury today has come to the right conclusion but I'm a bit sad he hasn't got the sentence. \"I'm sorry that Laura's granddad, who died last night, wasn't here to know this decision. I don't think about Bainbridge at all. My thoughts are with me and my children. I just want to be left alone to grieve for Laura and my father.\" Mrs Kane and Bainbridge had been introduced about four years before Laura's death at one of the local pubs where they both played darts. While carrying out repairs on Mrs Kane's home, he gained her trust and on August 25 last year, took his chance. He lured the little girl to his own house on the pretext of showing her his baby son. And it was there he carried out his barbaric act.",

He said the entire rail infrastructure needed massive improvements. \"The fundamental problem is that we are running every single train and there is no space to run any more,\" he said. RJB confirms bid talks Britain's biggest coal miner, RJB Mining, yesterday said it was in bid talks, but refused to say if it was discussing a management buyout or trade sale. The troubled company - which is valued at \u00a390m - disclosed the takeover talks at the same time as it announced a deal with cement producer Castle Cements for the supply of 300,000 tonnes of deep-mined coal. Industry sources said RJB could be of interest to a property company, given its extensive land bank of more than 40,000 acres, including existing and reclaimed mines and land affected by potential subsidence. EC investigates music venture The European Commission has decided to open a four-month inquiry into the planned music venture between Time Warner and EMI. The commission said the investigation's focus is likely to be on recorded music, music publishing and digital delivery of music via the internet. Wallis joins Stagecoach Stagecoach yesterday announced pre-tax profits of \u00a3244m, up 11%, and brought on board the former BAA head of finance, Russell Wallis, as a non-executive director to bolster the City's declining confidence in the company. The move was forced on Stagecoach after the worst 12 months in the company's 20-year history. Keith Cochrane, Stagecoach's chief executive, stressed that its founder and chairman, Brian Souter, had no intention of stepping down from his executive role.",

      "body": "<p>Any day now, one of two fiercely competing teams will announce that they have sequenced the human genome, and that this has been the greatest breakthrough in scientific understanding since Darwin; or perhaps even Newton, Copernicus, or the Big Bang. But one man, a scientist whom hardly anyone has heard of, did far more than the whole of the human genome project to discover why genes matter and how they might shape our destiny. </p> <p>The human genome project is designed to discover the precise composition of tens of thousands of genes. Bill Hamilton, apparently a shy and forgetful Oxford don, was not concerned with what genes are made of, but with what they do, and how their interplay can shape the world. He tried to give biological answers to the large questions, such as, why is there sex? Why do we grow old? And, in the world that made his name, why do animals sacrifice their own interests for the good of others? </p> <p>Hamilton was born in Cairo in 1936, the son of a civil engineer working in the Middle East, and died in April this year after contracting malaria on a Quixotic mission to collect chimpanzee faeces in the Congolese jungle. It was a characteristically brave and direct attempt to stand up an unpopular theory, in this case that the Aids epidemic was caused by a polio vaccination programme. He never shrank from physical effort or danger. As a teenager he blew the tips off two of his fingers while messing around with explosives (his father was a civil engineer). On a field trip in the Amazon he once jumped off the side of his boat to plug a leak with his finger, explaining afterwards that the ferocity of piranhas was much over-rated. He refused to wear a bicycle helmet even after being pitched through the windscreen of a car as he hurtled round Oxford. </p> <p>Those are things that made him loved. What will ensure his fame was that in two papers of almost impenetrable mathematics published in 1964, he discovered the selfish gene. In the papers, he expressed mathematically the ways in which self-sacrificing behaviour among individual creatures would spread if it were caused by a gene which was shared by lots of relatives who in their turn benefited from the self-sacrifice. </p> <p>It is less often noticed that the same theory explains with heartless and unanswerable elegance how selfish or gratuitously cruel impulses may spread and establish themselves if they turn out be more profitable to their bearer's genes than kindness would. Other great biologists, notably JBS Haldane, had seen that something of the sort must be true. Indeed, Haldane had turned a crude version of the idea into a pub joke. When asked, \"Should I lay down my life for my brothers?\", Haldane replied, \"Yes, for three brothers, five uncles or nine first cousins.\" </p> <p>But Hamilton gave this vague intuition solid mathematical backing and turned it into something other scientists could use to make predictions about the way any animal or even plant could behave and feel towards members of its own species. </p> <p>It took some time for the implications of his discovery to sink in. They didn't hit the non-specialist public until the early 70s, when they formed part of the framework of EO Wilson's Sociobiology and Richard Dawkins's The Selfish Gene. Though they are now regarded as perhaps the most important development of evolutionary theory since Darwin, Hamilton's interests were almost incomprehensible to his teachers when he was a postgraduate student at the London School of Economics and University College London. </p> <p>Years later, Hamilton wrote: \"I am afraid I still feel rather resentful about the matter in a general way. I would have hoped that the purpose of Haldane's aphorism was precisely to encourage young men to take up the study of what he considered an important topic. Yet at University College, surrounded presumably by a number of scientists who had been primed in this way, all my own attempts to tell people that a principle of this kind was needed in biology and this was what I was working on were met by the sourest rebuffs - words to the effect that I was wasting my time, there was no such thing as genetic altruism, or, at best, total disinterest. </p> <p>\"I suppose it is understandable that a disciple without a master must expect a hard time and that statements that seem significant or humorous according to the hearer's mood when uttered by a famous scientist seem to be heretical and ridiculous pretension when uttered by a detached graduate student, but I can't help feeling that it is wrong that this should be so in a university. I also have in mind that I was a rather retiring kind of student who preferred to withdraw from people who found me ridiculous rather than argue back.\" </p> <p>This came from a letter he wrote to John Maynard Smith, an older and almost equally distinguished biologist who had been one of the earliest champions of his ideas, but from whom he was for some years estranged because he believed that Maynard Smith had granted too much of the credit to Haldane for the ideas that Hamilton later developed. Later, Maynard Smith reproached himself for failing to recognise genius. But it is easy to understand how the student might have been overlooked. </p> <p>Though he passionately wanted recognition, he did not care at all for cities, and at times appeared to have an overwhelming longing for absence. There is a note of aching nostalgia for the wilderness which breaks again and again through the story of his early struggles. As a poor student he walked everywhere he could: \"I wanted to conjure and recreate somehow, below the bricks and mortar around me, the marshy fields that had once been there, the streams dividing them, and the heaths beneath - to seek, in short, the elemental forces underlying the city.

A passion for insects ran through his entire life. When he got his first job as a biologist, and moved to a bedsit near Windsor Great Park, it seemed to him a delightful bonus that it was infested with minute bacon beetles: \"I should explain that I am generally fond of indoor insects, think of them like pets and generally see an advantage over pets in that they don't need to be fed.\" In some of his speculations about eugenics, it can seem that he cared as little for humans as he might for insects; but if that's true it should be said that he clearly loved insects. It would be more just to say that he thought nature cared as little for mankind as for insects, as any honest naturalist must do. </p> <p>Even as a feted professor at Oxford, Hamilton had a quality of absence or self-effacement that was extraordinary. He spoke quietly, almost as if he were hesitant to remind you of something you already knew: my notes from talking to him in his office are almost incoherent, a little from awe, some perhaps from stupidity, but also because he seemed quite as happy to sit in silence as to talk. He was a tall man, extremely handsome, but carried himself like a hunter who would rather observe than be noticed. </p> <p>Partly as a result of this he was almost unbearably lonely and isolated when he worked on his first papers. \"Although supervised at the Galton Laboratory for two years, I never had a desk there - I think virtually no one I passed in the corridors or sat with in the library knew my name or what I was doing - most of the time I was extremely lonely,\" he wrote, years later, in the introduction to his collected papers.

Without huge training it is impossible to grasp their significance or why they excite people. But Hamilton's passions, refracted through his writing, never lacked significance or excitement.

      "bodyText": "Any day now, one of two fiercely competing teams will announce that they have sequenced the human genome, and that this has been the greatest breakthrough in scientific understanding since Darwin; or perhaps even Newton, Copernicus, or the Big Bang. But one man, a scientist whom hardly anyone has heard of, did far more than the whole of the human genome project to discover why genes matter and how they might shape our destiny. The human genome project is designed to discover the precise composition of tens of thousands of genes. Bill Hamilton, apparently a shy and forgetful Oxford don, was not concerned with what genes are made of, but with what they do, and how their interplay can shape the world. He tried to give biological answers to the large questions, such as, why is there sex? Why do we grow old? And, in the world that made his name, why do animals sacrifice their own interests for the good of others? Hamilton was born in Cairo in 1936, the son of a civil engineer working in the Middle East, and died in April this year after contracting malaria on a Quixotic mission to collect chimpanzee faeces in the Congolese jungle. It was a characteristically brave and direct attempt to stand up an unpopular theory, in this case that the Aids epidemic was caused by a polio vaccination programme. He never shrank from physical effort or danger. As a teenager he blew the tips off two of his fingers while messing around with explosives (his father was a civil engineer). On a field trip in the Amazon he once jumped off the side of his boat to plug a leak with his finger, explaining afterwards that the ferocity of piranhas was much over-rated. He refused to wear a bicycle helmet even after being pitched through the windscreen of a car as he hurtled round Oxford. Those are things that made him loved. What will ensure his fame was that in two papers of almost impenetrable mathematics published in 1964, he discovered the selfish gene. In the papers, he expressed mathematically the ways in which self-sacrificing behaviour among individual creatures would spread if it were caused by a gene which was shared by lots of relatives who in their turn benefited from the self-sacrifice. It is less often noticed that the same theory explains with heartless and unanswerable elegance how selfish or gratuitously cruel impulses may spread and establish themselves if they turn out be more profitable to their bearer's genes than kindness would. Other great biologists, notably JBS Haldane, had seen that something of the sort must be true. Indeed, Haldane had turned a crude version of the idea into a pub joke. When asked, \"Should I lay down my life for my brothers?\", Haldane replied, \"Yes, for three brothers, five uncles or nine first cousins.\" But Hamilton gave this vague intuition solid mathematical backing and turned it into something other scientists could use to make predictions about the way any animal or even plant could behave and feel towards members of its own species. It took some time for the implications of his discovery to sink in. They didn't hit the non-specialist public until the early 70s, when they formed part of the framework of EO Wilson's Sociobiology and Richard Dawkins's The Selfish Gene. Though they are now regarded as perhaps the most important development of evolutionary theory since Darwin, Hamilton's interests were almost incomprehensible to his teachers when he was a postgraduate student at the London School of Economics and University College London. Years later, Hamilton wrote: \"I am afraid I still feel rather resentful about the matter in a general way. I would have hoped that the purpose of Haldane's aphorism was precisely to encourage young men to take up the study of what he considered an important topic. Yet at University College, surrounded presumably by a number of scientists who had been primed in this way, all my own attempts to tell people that a principle of this kind was needed in biology and this was what I was working on were met by the sourest rebuffs - words to the effect that I was wasting my time, there was no such thing as genetic altruism, or, at best, total disinterest. \"I suppose it is understandable that a disciple without a master must expect a hard time and that statements that seem significant or humorous according to the hearer's mood when uttered by a famous scientist seem to be heretical and ridiculous pretension when uttered by a detached graduate student, but I can't help feeling that it is wrong that this should be so in a university. I also have in mind that I was a rather retiring kind of student who preferred to withdraw from people who found me ridiculous rather than argue back.\" This came from a letter he wrote to John Maynard Smith, an older and almost equally distinguished biologist who had been one of the earliest champions of his ideas, but from whom he was for some years estranged because he believed that Maynard Smith had granted too much of the credit to Haldane for the ideas that Hamilton later developed. Later, Maynard Smith reproached himself for failing to recognise genius. But it is easy to understand how the student might have been overlooked. Though he passionately wanted recognition, he did not care at all for cities, and at times appeared to have an overwhelming longing for absence. There is a note of aching nostalgia for the wilderness which breaks again and again through the story of his early struggles. As a poor student he walked everywhere he could: \"I wanted to conjure and recreate somehow, below the bricks and mortar around me, the marshy fields that had once been there, the streams dividing them, and the heaths beneath - to seek, in short, the elemental forces underlying the city. Even a lonely child crying on the street did not tug my heart as hard as a bracken fern when I saw it, for example, in the valley of the stream once called the Fleet.\" It was not just plants that moved him deeply.

They will be shocked that the elders who are supposed to get their messages direct from God should have voted for a change like this.</p> <p>\"Countless thousands whose relatives have been allowed to die needlessly will be angered that this could now be changed by a bunch of old men hiding in a room in New York after supposedly talking to God. They must be terrified of litigation.\"</p> <p>Jehovah's Witnesses believe that as life is a gift from God, blood should not be intermingled, taking their text from Acts chapter 15, verse 20, which instructs the faithful to abstain from things \"polluted by contact with idols, from fornication, from anything that has been strangled and from blood.\"</p> <p>The religion's 130,000 British adherents - among 6m worldwide - are not supposed to accept blood transfusions even if refusal results in their death.</p> <p>In January Beverley Matthews, 33, of Stockport, Greater Manchester, died after refusing a blood transfusion and last week a teenager, Brent Bond, of Nottingham, accepted a transfusion only seconds before lapsing into unconsciousness after losing five pints of blood in a machete attack.

      "bodyText": "Jehovah's Witnesses are braced for a flood of litigation following a vote by church elders in New York which may allow members to accept blood transfusions in critical medical circumstances providing they repent afterwards. The revelation that transfusions might now be acceptable, apparently decided by the church's world governing body by a vote of eight to four at a secret meeting last month, caused anguish and astonishment to adherents that one of the central tenets of the faith - and the cause of death for thousands of members over the years - was being abandoned. The decision means that members who accept transfusions may not be automatically expelled and shunned, so long as they repent and seek spiritual guidance. The church fears that disaffected members whose relatives have died after refusing blood may now seek damages. The witnesses' British headquarters at Watch Tower House in north London described the decision, which will be conveyed to members at Kingdom halls across the country by letter as \"a minor procedural change\". Geoffrey Unwin, an author and former Jehovah's Witness specialising in writing about cults, who broke the story in Britain, said: \"Witnesses are in a state of self denial at the moment. They will be shocked that the elders who are supposed to get their messages direct from God should have voted for a change like this. \"Countless thousands whose relatives have been allowed to die needlessly will be angered that this could now be changed by a bunch of old men hiding in a room in New York after supposedly talking to God. They must be terrified of litigation.\" Jehovah's Witnesses believe that as life is a gift from God, blood should not be intermingled, taking their text from Acts chapter 15, verse 20, which instructs the faithful to abstain from things \"polluted by contact with idols, from fornication, from anything that has been strangled and from blood.\" The religion's 130,000 British adherents - among 6m worldwide - are not supposed to accept blood transfusions even if refusal results in their death. In January Beverley Matthews, 33, of Stockport, Greater Manchester, died after refusing a blood transfusion and last week a teenager, Brent Bond, of Nottingham, accepted a transfusion only seconds before lapsing into unconsciousness after losing five pints of blood in a machete attack. The church said yesterday that he was not a Jehovah's Witness because he had not been baptised in the faith, although his mother who is a member, tried to prevent the operation. Jehovah's Witnesses are well known for the strictness of their observance. Members do not give presents at Christmas or birthdays, exchange greetings with non-believers or allow their children to take part in games or plays at school. Even use of the internet is frowned upon. The church insisted yesterday that the New York decision was clarification of existing rules and a simplification of the process of excommunication, though that came as a surprise to some witnesses. Paul Gillies, the church's spokesman said: \"If someone accepts a transfusion in a moment of weakness and then regrets it afterwards we can offer assistance, just as if they had committed adultery. But if they are no longer living by the rules they have excluded themselves. \"Nowadays the movement towards bloodless health care means we have had members who have had open heart surgery and liver transplants without using blood.\"",

      "bodyText": "The Ministry of Defence yesterday came under renewed pressure to overturn its finding that pilot error caused the Chinook helicopter crash which killed 25 senior security and intelligence officers after Scotland's senior law officer cast doubt on its findings. Colin Boyd QC, the lord advocate, said new information about faults in the helicopter's Fadec software \"may be thought to reinforce\" the inconclusive findings of a Scottish fatal accident inquiry into the crash on the Mull of Kintyre in June 1994. That inquiry, and the initial findings of an RAF board of inquiry, concluded that it was impossible to pinpoint blame. However, two air marshals later ruled that the crash was caused by the \"gross negli gence\" of the two pilots, flight lieutenants Jonathan Tapper and Richard Cook. Blaming pilots in this way has to pass the test of \"no possible doubt whatsoever\". But critics of the MoD, who include a growing number of MPs and the former defence secretary, Sir Malcolm Rifkind, say there is mounting evidence that this test has not been met. Such evidence was not given to the inquiries. Mr Boydsays that \"new information about Fadec invites speculation as to another possible cause for the crash\". Documents obtained by Computer Weekly magazine show that the Fadec system had caused problems in Britain and the US - and that the MoD has given misleading information to the Commons defence committee. The ministry told MPs that Boeing, makers of the Chinook, did not consider Fadec to be safety critical, but had said the opposite when it sued Textron Lycoming, the systems supplier, after an earlier accident. The lord advocate's comments are contained in a letter to Kenny MacAskill MSP, who yesterday called for a judicial inquiry into the affair. Sir Malcolm said he hoped Mr Boyd's letter would lead the MoD to overturn its verdict. \"I have always taken the view that the Ministry of Defence ought to allow the finding of gross negligence to lapse,\" he said.

Rebecca Gomperts of Amsterdam announced that she planned to offer abortions on a ship moored in international waters close to countries where abortion is illegal, including Malta. Lawrence Gonzi, the Maltese social policy minister, called the plan \"horrendous\". He said criminal proceedings would be undertaken against anyone organising or helping to arrange the service. Malta's bishops issued a statement calling on the government and all those responsible to ensure that no one had anything to do with these \"heinous murders\". The Maltese people are said to be strongly against abortion and all the island's political parties oppose it. It is claimed that some Maltese go abroad to have abortions.",

Baked beans are back on the menu for England's footballers after being shown the red card during the World Cup in France in 1998. England coach Kevin Keegan has decided to select baked beans for the team menu and dozens of tins have been brought out to Belgium following advice from nutritionists that they are healthy and could contribute to the overall fitness of players. Keegan's predecessor, Glenn Hoddle, banned baked beans during France '98 claiming that they were bad for the health because there was too much sugar in them. The England team chef, Roger Narbett, revealed however that Keegan has ordered that players cannot eat baked beans on match days for fear that it might effect their performance.

An appeal court in Dijon yesterday ordered the reopening of the case in which his mother, Christine, was originally charged with the murder in October 1984 and not cleared until nine years later. Her family successfully demanded that DNA tests be carried out on the torn stamp stuck to one of hundreds of threatening letters sent to Christine or her parents in an anonymous mail campaign. The \"corbeau\", or crow, terrorised L\u00e9panges on the river Vologne in the Vosges for more than three years with a flood of poison-pen letters and telephone calls, but has never been traced. At the time, police forced hundreds of men and women to undergo handwriting tests without success and compared their voices with the recorded messages made by a disguised voice. Suspicion has hung over the small village, with its cotton mill and smallholdings, ever since. Dozens of books, articles and broadcasts failed to break the silence of an introverted, feuding village in which Gr\u00e9gory's grandfather was accused by the letter-writer of being a tyrannical mill foreman. Police believe that a family member also had a grudge against Christine, who was wrongly alleged by the \"corbeau\" to have drowned the child because he had been conceived during an extra-marital affair. Although she stuck to emphatic denials until she was cleared by a judge, Christine was also designated as the murderer by the writer Marguerite Duras, who carried out her own investigation into the affair. The case had many twists including the murder of a cousin, Bernard Laroche, by Christine's husband, Jean-Marie Villemin, the sacking of an examining magistrate for pursuing a murder verdict against Christine on instinct alone, and criticism of the national and international press for encouraging her vilification. The Dijon appeal court overruled an official decision to close the case in 1993 after being told of recent advances in DNA detection. The Dijon judges were told that a running feud in the Villemin family had been temporarily suspended so that a joint application could be made for the torn stamp, taken from a letter sent six months before the murder, to be examined by police scientists. They had been assured that even the tiniest genetic imprint would be enough to point the finger at the true killer, who is still thought to be a member of the family.",

But the expected deal fell far short of their initial demand for an immediate cessation.</p> <p>Though the issue of how long to wait was at the nub of the last round of talks, the last switch is not thought likely to be thrown for at least 20 years. However, a Green MP, Reinhard Loske, said last night that Germany could be nuclear-free by 2019. He added that the earliest, oldest reactors to be shut could be off-stream before the next election in 2002.</p> <p>That presupposes that any deal with the companies will survive. It faces not only resistance from radical Greens, who see it as a shabby compromise, but also the threat of legal challenges from regional governments which have a stake in the atomic energy business. In addition, the conservative opposition has threatened to block any deal in the upper house of parliament. Mr Schr\u00f6der has said he is confident that a bill could be drawn up which would not need to go to both chambers.</p> <p>The threat of lawsuits lay behind the government's search for a compromise, launched 18 months ago. The companies had promised to sue for losses if they were forced to close down the reactors before recovering their investment.</p> <p>Last year, according to figures supplied by the International Atomic Energy Agency, Germany's 19 reactors generated almost a third of the country's electricity. Only the US, France and Japan had a greater nuclear capacity.</p> <p>Opponents of the shutdown have argued that by scrapping atomic energy Germany could end up burning more fossil fuels, thus endangering the environment in other ways.</p> <p>A draft agreement between the government and industry, leaked last week, would put the nuclear business into a progressively narrowing tunnel. It would set a fixed amount of power to be produced by each plant from January 1 this year until its decommissioning. The power companies would report the monthly amount of power generated by each plant to Germany's nuclear safety authority, which would then subtract that amount from the total allowed. But generating entitlements could be transferred between reactors, allowing the industry to maximise the output from the newer, more efficient stations and minimise production from the older and less efficient ones.</p> <p>The draft was reportedly prepared in mid-April but was delayed by disagreements over the fate of the M\u00fclheim-K\u00e4rlich plant, which was mothballed in 1988 as an earthquake security measure after just 13 months of service.</p> <p>Crucially, the document left blank both the date by which the last plant would be shut down and the amount of power each plant was entitled to generate before being shut.</p> <p>On the question of waste, however, it was plain: the utility companies would be expected within five years to set up temporary storage sites as close as possible to the power plants. The transport of nuclear waste for reprocessing would be allowed until July 1 2005, but the utility companies would be under an obligation to do everything they could to end reprocessing as soon as possible.</p> <p>This aspect of the deal is crucial for Britain and British Nuclear Fuels Limited. In March, Germany, BNFL's second biggest customer after Japan, suspended indefinitely on safety grounds all contracts to buy reprocessed fuel from the company.</p> <p>The four major German power companies - RWE, Viag, Veba and Energie Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg - were all represented at last night's session at the chancellery. Among signs pointing to a deal was the calling of a press conference today at which Mr Schr\u00f6der was due to appear alongside his environment minister, J\u00fcrgen Trittin, and the economics minister, Werner M\u00fcller.</p> <p>One of the biggest and earliest challenges to the proposed deal is a Greens' congress in little over a week's time, which could instruct party leaders to reject the compromise. Some Greens have called for a break-up of their party's coalition with the Social Democrats if the exit from nuclear power is not swift enough.</p> <p>Officials of the regional administration in Bavaria said meanwhile that they were already drawing up an appeal against the deal, which they intended to put before the constitutional court.</p>",

He added that the earliest, oldest reactors to be shut could be off-stream before the next election in 2002. That presupposes that any deal with the companies will survive. It faces not only resistance from radical Greens, who see it as a shabby compromise, but also the threat of legal challenges from regional governments which have a stake in the atomic energy business. In addition, the conservative opposition has threatened to block any deal in the upper house of parliament. Mr Schr\u00f6der has said he is confident that a bill could be drawn up which would not need to go to both chambers. The threat of lawsuits lay behind the government's search for a compromise, launched 18 months ago. The companies had promised to sue for losses if they were forced to close down the reactors before recovering their investment. Last year, according to figures supplied by the International Atomic Energy Agency, Germany's 19 reactors generated almost a third of the country's electricity. Only the US, France and Japan had a greater nuclear capacity. Opponents of the shutdown have argued that by scrapping atomic energy Germany could end up burning more fossil fuels, thus endangering the environment in other ways. A draft agreement between the government and industry, leaked last week, would put the nuclear business into a progressively narrowing tunnel. It would set a fixed amount of power to be produced by each plant from January 1 this year until its decommissioning. The power companies would report the monthly amount of power generated by each plant to Germany's nuclear safety authority, which would then subtract that amount from the total allowed. But generating entitlements could be transferred between reactors, allowing the industry to maximise the output from the newer, more efficient stations and minimise production from the older and less efficient ones. The draft was reportedly prepared in mid-April but was delayed by disagreements over the fate of the M\u00fclheim-K\u00e4rlich plant, which was mothballed in 1988 as an earthquake security measure after just 13 months of service. Crucially, the document left blank both the date by which the last plant would be shut down and the amount of power each plant was entitled to generate before being shut. On the question of waste, however, it was plain: the utility companies would be expected within five years to set up temporary storage sites as close as possible to the power plants. The transport of nuclear waste for reprocessing would be allowed until July 1 2005, but the utility companies would be under an obligation to do everything they could to end reprocessing as soon as possible. This aspect of the deal is crucial for Britain and British Nuclear Fuels Limited. In March, Germany, BNFL's second biggest customer after Japan, suspended indefinitely on safety grounds all contracts to buy reprocessed fuel from the company. The four major German power companies - RWE, Viag, Veba and Energie Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg - were all represented at last night's session at the chancellery. Among signs pointing to a deal was the calling of a press conference today at which Mr Schr\u00f6der was due to appear alongside his environment minister, J\u00fcrgen Trittin, and the economics minister, Werner M\u00fcller. One of the biggest and earliest challenges to the proposed deal is a Greens' congress in little over a week's time, which could instruct party leaders to reject the compromise. Some Greens have called for a break-up of their party's coalition with the Social Democrats if the exit from nuclear power is not swift enough. Officials of the regional administration in Bavaria said meanwhile that they were already drawing up an appeal against the deal, which they intended to put before the constitutional court.",

Nissan has developed a vehicle which has two small video cameras mounted on both sides of the front bumper. These send images on to a dashboard monitor, which gives the driver a clear view of right and left before a junction has been reached. If the camera spots an approaching vehicle on either side of a junction, a red indicator light on the screen advises the driver to take care. The car will be tested in Japan in October as part of a transport safety initiative. \"It will be about three years before we see this kind of technology in place,\" said a Nissan UK spokesman. \"The plan is to have this eventually fitted as standard.\" Press Association",

      "bodyText": "American symphony orchestras and musicians' representatives have signed a historic agreement to make the internet their primary distribution medium for live and recorded concert performances of classical music, opera and ballet. The agreement, which follows a year of negotiations between more than 70 of America's most famous orchestras and the musicians' union, recognises that the era of commercially recorded discs could be ending. The web is now poised to become the main source for privately purchased orchestral music. Every famous American orchestra - including the New York Philharmonic and the Metropolitan Opera - has agreed to the deal, which will eventually govern the way that musicians are paid for web-available performances. More than 5,000 American symphonic musicians have endorsed the agreement. The orchestras are free to develop their own websites and to decide whether to make their concerts available as live \"streaming audio\" - which cannot be downloaded by listeners - or as recordings that can be downloaded for a fee, an option which is unlikely to become widespread until high-speed internet access is more commonly available. There is very little evidence that classical music is in demand on the internet, but the phenomenal success of websites like Napster - which offers free downloads of pop music - has encouraged orchestral managements to create their own demand. Several orchestras, of which the Cleveland Orchestra is the most prominent, have been developing strategies for selling their performances on line. More importantly, the agreement marks a turning point. Most recording companies have slashed investment in new recordings and classical music releases, especially when it involves hiring orchestras. In the US, only two orchestras - the New York Philharmonic and the Chicago Symphony - still have recording contracts, though many orchestras continue to make recordings on an ad-hoc basis. \"It's no secret that the volume of classical recording has diminished spectacularly over recent years,\" said Florence Nelson of the American Federation of Musicians, which negotiated the deal. \"This agreement means that the internet [will be] an effective future way of distributing our members' work.\" \"I see downloading of music on the internet as the next extension of the process that began with 78s. The big difference about the internet is that it streamlines the distribution system and lowers prices,\" says Joseph Kluger, the president of the Philadelphia Orchestra and the chairman of the management side of the negotiations. \"Eventually, it will mean the end of the compact disc industry as we know it, even if not [the end] of the compact disc.\" Recording companies have increasingly lost interest in making new recordings of the classical repertoire because sales so rarely rise above a few thousand. Most companies already possess several versions of the standard repertoire, many of them with top performers and in good quality sound from the early 1990s. Orchestras such as the Cleveland, the Philadelphia, or the Boston Symphony, which were in the forefront of the recording industry for long stretches of the 20th century under celebrated conductors such as Leopold Stokowski, George Szell and Seiji Ozawa, now no longer have recording contracts. \"The recording industry no longer has any significant interest in the creation and effective marketing of new recordings of our orchestras,\" the two sides said in a joint memorandum explaining the terms of the new deal to their members. However, neither the orchestras nor the musicians' union appear to be under many illusions that there will be instant financial returns from the new initiative. \"My personal belief is that the culture of the internet is based on the premise that the content is free,\" says Mr Kluger. \"I think that, at first, most orchestras will end up offering their music for streaming, free to the consumer.\" Ms Nelson agrees: \"It's a shared risk.

But in 1968, a pulsating Homer Banks, Al Jackson and Bettye Crutcher composition, Who's Making Love, shot Taylor into the charts - the record made number one in the R&amp;B lists and number five in the pop chart. Initially, he had not liked the song - Detroit producer Don Davis had managed successfully to merge the southern-fried, horn-blasted gutsiness of Stax with the uptown, bass-propelled drive of Motown - but the chart placing soon changed his mind.</p> <p>For the next seven years, Taylor enjoyed a virtually unbroken run of hit 45s and big-selling albums. Top-10 R&amp;B singles - such as Testify and I Could Never Be President - built his reputation for consistency, while Taylor's musical peaks occurred during the middle 70s. We're Getting Careless With Our Love, a superb Don Davis/ Frank Johnson tune inspired by Billy Paul's Me &amp; Mrs Jones and the number one hit I Believe In You [You Believe In Me], both from the superb Taylored In Silk album, made him a huge box office draw across the States.</p> <p>When Stax Records succumbed to the weight of its accumulated debts in 1975, Taylor signed for CBS and wisely took his regular producer with him. Their first song for the major, Disco Lady, pulled the neat trick of calling itself a disco record when it was really just a churning, bass-heavy soul tune, and became the biggest selling single in CBS's history. The album it came from, Eargasm, was similarly popular. It was a commercial peak Taylor would never scale again. Ever Ready, in 1978, was the last of his albums CBS released in this country.

      "body": "<p>Sir Roualeyn Cumming-Bruce, a former Lord Justice of Appeal, who has died aged 88, was a realistic and intuitive judge, renowned for his sympathetic divorce and custody decisions, and vivid turn of phrase.</p> <p>One of his first divorce cases on the bench involved a wife who \"put golf before her home duties and any attempt to give any companionship to her husband\". Advised by doctors to take up the game following a nervous breakdown, the woman had soon achieved a handicap of 11, but refused to play with her husband; Cumming-Bruce granted him a decree nisi on the ground of desertion.</p> <p>Cumming-Bruce also granted divorces to the wife of Tony Hancock because of cruelty and adultery; the wife of an architect who hid her engagement ring on his toe to teach her not to lose it; and a retired Royal Naval captain who kept a log of his wife's behaviour and a graph of her gin consumption.</p> <p>But Cumming-Bruce did not dish out divorces willy-nilly. Among the disappointed petitioners that came before him was a wife whose laughter in the cinema had caused her husband to twist her arm and kick her ankle, and a couple whose marriage he admitted was \"as dead as a doornail\".</p> <p>It was a reflection of the high esteem in which Cumming-Bruce was held that he was promoted to the Court of Appeal just 18 months after pleading guilty to drunken driving. \"I think I have had an unwise number of gin and tonics,\" he told the policeman who arrested him in the Mall.</p> <p>A younger twin (the third son of the Rev Lord Thurlow, 6th Baron), he was educated at Shrewsbury, and at Magdalene College, Cambridge, where he took a first in classics. For a time at Cambridge, he dallied with communism, but during the holidays he put his convictions to one side and enjoyed his hunting.</p> <p>In 1937 he was called to the Bar by Middle Temple as a Harmsworth scholar, but with the outbreak of war went to serve in the Royal Artillery in North Africa and the Middle East, rising to lieutenant colonel. He was somewhat surprised to be posted to a senior staff job in Cairo - the War Office later admitted they had meant to send his brother, Harry, a regular soldier.

      "bodyText": "Sir Roualeyn Cumming-Bruce, a former Lord Justice of Appeal, who has died aged 88, was a realistic and intuitive judge, renowned for his sympathetic divorce and custody decisions, and vivid turn of phrase. One of his first divorce cases on the bench involved a wife who \"put golf before her home duties and any attempt to give any companionship to her husband\". Advised by doctors to take up the game following a nervous breakdown, the woman had soon achieved a handicap of 11, but refused to play with her husband; Cumming-Bruce granted him a decree nisi on the ground of desertion. Cumming-Bruce also granted divorces to the wife of Tony Hancock because of cruelty and adultery; the wife of an architect who hid her engagement ring on his toe to teach her not to lose it; and a retired Royal Naval captain who kept a log of his wife's behaviour and a graph of her gin consumption. But Cumming-Bruce did not dish out divorces willy-nilly. Among the disappointed petitioners that came before him was a wife whose laughter in the cinema had caused her husband to twist her arm and kick her ankle, and a couple whose marriage he admitted was \"as dead as a doornail\". It was a reflection of the high esteem in which Cumming-Bruce was held that he was promoted to the Court of Appeal just 18 months after pleading guilty to drunken driving. \"I think I have had an unwise number of gin and tonics,\" he told the policeman who arrested him in the Mall. A younger twin (the third son of the Rev Lord Thurlow, 6th Baron), he was educated at Shrewsbury, and at Magdalene College, Cambridge, where he took a first in classics. For a time at Cambridge, he dallied with communism, but during the holidays he put his convictions to one side and enjoyed his hunting. In 1937 he was called to the Bar by Middle Temple as a Harmsworth scholar, but with the outbreak of war went to serve in the Royal Artillery in North Africa and the Middle East, rising to lieutenant colonel. He was somewhat surprised to be posted to a senior staff job in Cairo - the War Office later admitted they had meant to send his brother, Harry, a regular soldier. In Egypt, he had the job of showing Mme Chiang around Luxor while her husband Chiang Kai-Shek attended the 1943 Cairo conference. To keep her from disrupting the discussions in Cairo, their plane suffered three days of \"engine trouble\" at Luxor. Cumming-Bruce did a variety of work in his early years at the Bar, including crime, libel and personal injury, much of it on the Northern Circuit. But it was his accomplished performances for bodies such as the Law Society - prosecuting, among others, people for pretending to be solicitors - and the Registrar of Restrictive Practices that marked him as a potential junior counsel to the Treasury (common law), which he became in 1959. Senior counsel for the Crown in civil matters are the attorney-general and solicitor-general, but due to their extensive political responsibilities, most of the burden falls on the juniors, who by convention were rewarded with a High Court judgeship after five years without having taken Silk. The positions are thus some of the plum offerings of the profession, and zealously sought-after. Cumming-Bruce played a prominent part in the contempt proceedings against the silent journalists at the Vassall tribunal - set up to inquire into how John Vassall's spying had led to Russian spy-trawlers turning up at Nato exercises - and in 1964 was duly made a High Court judge, assigned to what was then the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division (later the Family Division).

      "body": "<p>The villages around Cambridge are popular retreats for university dons, who like to withdraw to a picturesque cottages after slaving away in their ivory towers. This rural idyll has, however, been challenged in recent years by an influx of wealthy young employees of hi-tech businesses who have pushed house prices to stratospheric levels. </p> <p>These newcomers, with their designer-casual clothes and elaborate laptop computers, are often blamed for the expansion of villages into surrounding countryside - a trend which upsets long-term residents. </p> <p>Cambridgeshire is indeed booming; the area known as Silicon Fen is home to one of Britain's biggest clusters of hi-tech companies and there are new arrivals almost weekly. Altogether, about 1,200 hi-tech firms in the region employ around 35,000 people. Among the best known local businesses are the microchip maker Arm Holdings, the internet software company Autonomy and one of Britain's biggest biotechnology firms, Cambridge Antibody Technologies. One of the latest employers to arrive in town is the Malaysian Space Agency, which has set up shop just around the corner from Microsoft. </p> <p>As David Howarth, the leader of Cambridge city council, says: \"Cambridge is no longer a market town with a university. It's a thriving commercial, in one sense industrial, centre.\" </p> <p>The centre of Cambridge has changed little through the ages; it has kept its postcard imagery of punts floating on the river Cam, students hurrying around in college scarves and narrow streets separating ancient buildings. Just half an hour's walk towards the outskirts of town, the landscape changes dramatically. </p> <p>The city is practically encircled by the science parks which nestle just inside the \"green belt\" that restricts the expansion of the built-up area. Hi-tech companies are based in shiny glass blocks, surrounded by landscaped grassland and busy roads. </p> <p>The biggest cluster of companies is in the Cambridge Science Park, owned by Trinity college. It is home to 64 businesses, employing more than 4,000 people. </p> <p>Among them is Cantab Pharmaceuticals, a biotech firm with a stock market value of about \u00a3170m. Its research director, Stephen Inglis, says: \"Being in Cambridge has been a huge help to us. There's a tremendous science base at the university and there are also other institutions here, like the medical research council.\" </p> <p>Like many on the park, however, he complains that the place is slightly soulless: \"There's something missing - a spark that's not here.\" </p> <p>Despite the idea of creating a community of hi-tech companies, there is little contact between neighbours on the park. Dr Inglis says: \"In a way, that has been something of a disappointment. We see people from other companies at the annual fun run here for Children in Need, and it's only then that you get a sense of the number of people around.\" </p> <p>Others complain that there has been no \"greater plan\" for Cambridge. Various developers have established science parks but transport is a huge problem, as is housing. </p> <p>These issues are partly the result of traditional wrangles between factions with different views of how Cambridge should develop. After the war, local politicians watched with horror as the city's historic rival, Oxford, allowed the development of the huge Cowley car plant - considered a carbuncle on the skyline of dreaming spires. </p> <p><strong>Beaten by Portsmouth</strong><br> </p> <p>In the late 1960s, the council caused a furore by refusing to allow IBM to build its European research centre locally. The plant, and the prospect of thousands of jobs, went to Portsmouth instead. </p> <p>Planners in Cambridge now welcome hi-tech developments, giving them priority over other proposals. However, problems persist - Colin Bastable, marketing director of nCipher, a start-up encryption company, says: \"The city's going to have to expand and provide extra accommodation.\" </p> <p>nCipher is a typical product of the internet revolution. Founded by brothers, Alex and Nico van Someren, the company makes processors which handle security for online transactions. </p> <p>The company employs 90 people and has its headquarters in an office block near Cambridge's railway station. Mr Bastable boasts that the firm's customers include eight of the top 10 online stockbrokers, the internet bank Egg and the US defence department. </p> <p>The Cambridge connection goes back to Nico van Someren's education - he took a PhD at Trinity. </p> <p>Mr Bastable says: \"We're here because we do a lot of work with the university. In terms of employment, the area's got the right skill sets and it offers a decent quality of life.\" </p> <p>Adam Twiss, the chief executive of e-commerce software company Zeus Technology, reckons Cambridge compares favourably to America's silicon valley in lifestyle terms. \"Silicon valley's a great place to do business but a horrible place to live. I've been to San Jose in silicon valley and it's soulless - there is huge poverty in the area as well as enormous wealth.\" </p> <p>Zeus makes software which helps businesses to handle billions of dollars worth of transactions a day. Mr Twiss says that one in 50 of the world's websites uses the company's technology. </p> <p>The company was established in the St John's Innovation Centre - one of Cambridge's leading incubators of new businesses. The centre is St John's college's contribution to local enterprise. The two colleges, both extremely wealthy, have been significant catalysts in the development of Silicon Fen, with Trinity first off the block in the 1960s. Mr Twiss says: \"Trinity realised there was only so much they could spend on port for their high table dinners so they were going to have to find something else to spend their cash on. They decided to try and help local businesses.\" </p> <p>Given the historic rivalry between Trinity and St John's - which dates back to an incident in which a cox died in a boat race between the two colleges - it was only a matter of time before St John's plunged into the hi-tech arena as well. </p> <p>Recent planning guidance has discouraged the construction of any more science parks in south Cambridgeshire but the council reckons there is still space for a few more companies within the city. New entrants had better hurry. House prices are approaching London levels and there is barely any space left on the roads.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The villages around Cambridge are popular retreats for university dons, who like to withdraw to a picturesque cottages after slaving away in their ivory towers. This rural idyll has, however, been challenged in recent years by an influx of wealthy young employees of hi-tech businesses who have pushed house prices to stratospheric levels. These newcomers, with their designer-casual clothes and elaborate laptop computers, are often blamed for the expansion of villages into surrounding countryside - a trend which upsets long-term residents. Cambridgeshire is indeed booming; the area known as Silicon Fen is home to one of Britain's biggest clusters of hi-tech companies and there are new arrivals almost weekly. Altogether, about 1,200 hi-tech firms in the region employ around 35,000 people. Among the best known local businesses are the microchip maker Arm Holdings, the internet software company Autonomy and one of Britain's biggest biotechnology firms, Cambridge Antibody Technologies. One of the latest employers to arrive in town is the Malaysian Space Agency, which has set up shop just around the corner from Microsoft. As David Howarth, the leader of Cambridge city council, says: \"Cambridge is no longer a market town with a university. It's a thriving commercial, in one sense industrial, centre.\" The centre of Cambridge has changed little through the ages; it has kept its postcard imagery of punts floating on the river Cam, students hurrying around in college scarves and narrow streets separating ancient buildings. Just half an hour's walk towards the outskirts of town, the landscape changes dramatically. The city is practically encircled by the science parks which nestle just inside the \"green belt\" that restricts the expansion of the built-up area. Hi-tech companies are based in shiny glass blocks, surrounded by landscaped grassland and busy roads. The biggest cluster of companies is in the Cambridge Science Park, owned by Trinity college. It is home to 64 businesses, employing more than 4,000 people. Among them is Cantab Pharmaceuticals, a biotech firm with a stock market value of about \u00a3170m. Its research director, Stephen Inglis, says: \"Being in Cambridge has been a huge help to us. There's a tremendous science base at the university and there are also other institutions here, like the medical research council.\" Like many on the park, however, he complains that the place is slightly soulless: \"There's something missing - a spark that's not here.\" Despite the idea of creating a community of hi-tech companies, there is little contact between neighbours on the park. Dr Inglis says: \"In a way, that has been something of a disappointment. We see people from other companies at the annual fun run here for Children in Need, and it's only then that you get a sense of the number of people around.\" Others complain that there has been no \"greater plan\" for Cambridge. Various developers have established science parks but transport is a huge problem, as is housing. These issues are partly the result of traditional wrangles between factions with different views of how Cambridge should develop. After the war, local politicians watched with horror as the city's historic rival, Oxford, allowed the development of the huge Cowley car plant - considered a carbuncle on the skyline of dreaming spires. Beaten by Portsmouth In the late 1960s, the council caused a furore by refusing to allow IBM to build its European research centre locally. The plant, and the prospect of thousands of jobs, went to Portsmouth instead. Planners in Cambridge now welcome hi-tech developments, giving them priority over other proposals. However, problems persist - Colin Bastable, marketing director of nCipher, a start-up encryption company, says: \"The city's going to have to expand and provide extra accommodation.\" nCipher is a typical product of the internet revolution. Founded by brothers, Alex and Nico van Someren, the company makes processors which handle security for online transactions. The company employs 90 people and has its headquarters in an office block near Cambridge's railway station. Mr Bastable boasts that the firm's customers include eight of the top 10 online stockbrokers, the internet bank Egg and the US defence department. The Cambridge connection goes back to Nico van Someren's education - he took a PhD at Trinity. Mr Bastable says: \"We're here because we do a lot of work with the university. In terms of employment, the area's got the right skill sets and it offers a decent quality of life.\" Adam Twiss, the chief executive of e-commerce software company Zeus Technology, reckons Cambridge compares favourably to America's silicon valley in lifestyle terms. \"Silicon valley's a great place to do business but a horrible place to live. I've been to San Jose in silicon valley and it's soulless - there is huge poverty in the area as well as enormous wealth.\" Zeus makes software which helps businesses to handle billions of dollars worth of transactions a day. Mr Twiss says that one in 50 of the world's websites uses the company's technology. The company was established in the St John's Innovation Centre - one of Cambridge's leading incubators of new businesses. The centre is St John's college's contribution to local enterprise. The two colleges, both extremely wealthy, have been significant catalysts in the development of Silicon Fen, with Trinity first off the block in the 1960s. Mr Twiss says: \"Trinity realised there was only so much they could spend on port for their high table dinners so they were going to have to find something else to spend their cash on. They decided to try and help local businesses.\" Given the historic rivalry between Trinity and St John's - which dates back to an incident in which a cox died in a boat race between the two colleges - it was only a matter of time before St John's plunged into the hi-tech arena as well. Recent planning guidance has discouraged the construction of any more science parks in south Cambridgeshire but the council reckons there is still space for a few more companies within the city. New entrants had better hurry. House prices are approaching London levels and there is barely any space left on the roads.",

      "body": "<b> Walk anywhere and you see masses of birds, but you rarely see a dead one. Is the food chain incredibly efficiently at having them all gobbled up, or do they all go to a secret place to die?</b> <p> * Live birds attract attention in many ways: singing, flying in the sky, perching in prominent places and hopping around looking for food and twigs. Dead birds aren't as good at all that sort of stuff. </p> <p> Ian Wallace, London SE16. </p> <p>* Something like 600m birds from the British breeding population die each year. They die in all sorts of ways and have very different chances of being found. </p> <p>For instance, a mute swan dying by flying into wires is very likely to cut off the electricity and provides a conspicuous mound of white feathers. Something like 40% of deaths of ringed mute swans get reported. Another bird, dying in the same way, may be so small and so well camouflaged that no one will notice it. The body may be snaffled completely by a scavenger like a fox or a magpie. </p> <p>Of the deaths each year, about 60m are at the paws of domestic cats. Others occur on roads - and these are the dead birds we see. The bodies are an important reason for the increase in scavengers like foxes, magpies and crows: they provide a good food supply in winter when it used to be scarce. Active predators, like sparrowhawks, also take very large numbers of birds but prefer the easy ones that are a bit under the weather. </p> <p>Otherwise we are not likely to find the body of a bird that feels unwell and drops dead off its perch in a bush. The smell of decay will attract mammals and insects that consider it lunch. The deaths of ringed small birds are typically reported at a rate of 1% to 2% if they live close to houses - like bluetits and robins - but this is reduced to 0.3% for tiny migrants living in the woods, like willow warblers or tree pipits. </p> <p> Chris Mead, Thetford, Norfolk. </p> <p> <b> The electronic door key to my car has a range of about 30ft but this can be increased considerably if I direct it up under my chin and press the open or close button while looking towards the car. Why is this, and is it dangerous?</b> </p> <p> * Thanks for the tip about this method, by which we now open our electric gate. We are looking forward to expert advice in your column before we do ourselves irreversible brain damage. </p> <p>My wife has discovered that the range can be increased still further if you also open your mouth wide - the wider the better. My own range-extender is to glare angrily at the receiver. </p> <p> Brian Turner, St Genis Pouilly, France. </p> <p>* Without pausing to consider how this theory was developed, the empirical evidence offered seems to indicate that the signal emitted through the bottom of this electronic \"key\" is much stronger than that projected through its muzzle. Therefore, if used as directed, this device must surely bombard the user's reproductive region with signals much stronger than required to open an automobile door lock. This may result - in the Darwinian sense - in the prevalence of those who persist in using metal keys at close range to get into their cars. </p> <p> Bruce Levine, Ottawa, Canada. </p> <p> <b> Recently launched yoghurt drinks claim all sorts of health benefits but they seem very expensive too. The contents list itemises something called lactobacillus casei Shirota . Why is this stuff supposed to be so good for me and why does it cost so much?</b> </p> <p> * It's a bacterium found in dairy products and environments, as well as the human mouth, the small and large intestines and the vagina. </p> <p>There is a large body of scientific literature on the subject which suggests, among other things, that oral ingestion of lactobacillus cultures can reduce diarrhoea in children, enhance the growth of the epithelial cells lining the gut and increase the levels of gut microflora in cases of malnutrition. </p> <p>However, if you are in good health, have a varied diet and have not recently zapped your own gut bacteria with oral antibiotics, it seems unlikely that yoghurt drinks will have any other beneficial effect. </p> <p>Why do these drinks cost so much? Probably because the manufacturers of these and other \"health\" products know that the people who buy them work on the (entirely mistaken) assumption that \"the more it costs the more good it must be doing me\". </p> <p> Michael Hutton, London SE5. </p> <p>* Lactobacillus casei Shirota is a lactic acid bacterium first isolated by Dr Minoru Shirota, a microbiologist at Kyoto University, in 1930. Most bacteria in dairy products are killed by stomach acids, but lactobacillus is a unique beneficial strain that can survive the stomach acids and reach the intestines in viable form. </p> <p>There lactobacillus helps maintain a favourable balance among the billions of different bacteria which make up the intestinal flora. A poor diet, antibiotics, the stresses and strains of everyday life and the ageing process often upset this balance. </p> <p>Every bottle of Yakult contains 6.5 billion lactobacillus casei Shirota bacteria. A daily bottle will top up the good bacteria in your digestive system. One hundred and ninety billion friendly bacteria per penny seems a bargain. At around 36p a bottle, Yakult costs less than most canned or bottled drinks. </p> <p> Dr Colette Shortt, chief nutritionist, Yakult UK, London W3. </p> <p> <b> Agatha Christie's The Sittaford Mystery refers to a game called \"Up, Jenkyns\". What was this game, and what were the rules?</b> </p> <p> * My family played the game described by Betty Roycroft (Notes &amp; Queries, May 11) with similar rules. The main difference was that Team B had to identify the location of the coin in the closed fists (not therefore concealed between thumb and forefinger as in her version) of Team A by studying facial expression or the twitching of muscles. </p> <p>Members of Team B would take turns at trying to locate the coin, and each could have several attempts by tapping the suspect fist and saying: \"Tip it.\" That fist had then to be opened. If it contained the coin, this was surrendered to Team B; if it did not the fist was removed from the table, leaving the rest of Team A unmoved, and Team B then tried again through a different member. </p> <p>The game was usually played after a family meal, particularly Christmas dinner, when a sixpence from the pudding made an ideal target. An even more hysterical version involved using a ring on a continuous string which went all round the table. Passing the ring secretly among Team A without the jerking of the string revealing its whereabouts to Team B involved skill and daring; on occasions the ring could be lost and even end up on Team B's side. </p> <p>Family lore has it that the game is so-called bacause it was played by young naval officers round the wardroom table using a small object representing the ear of Captain Robert Jenkins, whose claim that Spaniards cut off his ear in 1731 contributed to public enthusiasm for war with Spain eight years later (the War of Jenkin's Ear). Naval historians might like to comment. </p> <p> Geoffrey Meredith, Norton St Philip, Somerset. </p> <p> <b> Why do wine bottles have a large indent in the base?</b> </p> <p> * Ray Cobbett, who considers wine corks to be a \"ridiculous snobbery\" (Notes &amp; Queries, May 4), might like to consider that the traditional management of cork oak forest in Portugal, which supplies 80 per cent of the world's wine corks, is vital to both the economy of one of the poorest regions in Europe and the sustainability of one of the world's richest ecosystems. The cork oak forest, habitat of the Iberian lynx, black stork, Bonelli's eagle and Spanish imperial eagle, is under severe threat from the increasing use of plastic \"corq\" (manufactured by Supremecorq, in which Bill Gates is a major investor). Right-on wine drinkers should express concern to their supermarkets - especially Oddbins, which intends to phase out the use of corks by the end of the year. </p> <p> Clare Butler, Milton Keynes, Bucks. <br><br><b>Any answers?</b></p> <p><b> I bumped into a friend the other day but had forgotten his name.

Family lore has it that the game is so-called bacause it was played by young naval officers round the wardroom table using a small object representing the ear of Captain Robert Jenkins, whose claim that Spaniards cut off his ear in 1731 contributed to public enthusiasm for war with Spain eight years later (the War of Jenkin's Ear). Naval historians might like to comment. Geoffrey Meredith, Norton St Philip, Somerset. Why do wine bottles have a large indent in the base? * Ray Cobbett, who considers wine corks to be a \"ridiculous snobbery\" (Notes &amp; Queries, May 4), might like to consider that the traditional management of cork oak forest in Portugal, which supplies 80 per cent of the world's wine corks, is vital to both the economy of one of the poorest regions in Europe and the sustainability of one of the world's richest ecosystems. The cork oak forest, habitat of the Iberian lynx, black stork, Bonelli's eagle and Spanish imperial eagle, is under severe threat from the increasing use of plastic \"corq\" (manufactured by Supremecorq, in which Bill Gates is a major investor). Right-on wine drinkers should express concern to their supermarkets - especially Oddbins, which intends to phase out the use of corks by the end of the year. Clare Butler, Milton Keynes, Bucks. Any answers? I bumped into a friend the other day but had forgotten his name. I know that he had forgotten mine too. How do you get out of such an embarrassing situation? Jonathan Green, Highbury, London. What was the purpose of covered bridges in North America? Stephen Farrugia, Sydney, Australia. I keep getting e-mails inviting me to obtain an international driver's licence which can never be suspended or revoked. Apparently, this privilege is guaranteed by the United Nations Convention on International Road Traffic (1949), and the World Court decision (The Hague, 1958). Is this true? Quentin Burrell, Ballabeg, Isle of Man. If we live in a market economy and pride ourselves on being a trading nation, how can ticket touting at sporting and artistic events be considered wrong or even illegal? Peter Stokoe, Lambeth, London SE5. On the death of the Queen , will QCs automatically become KCs? Brian Robinson, Hutton, Essex.

He paced about, oblivious to the crowds, madly ploughing vectors and angles into his sketchpad with a felt tip pen that screeched, slid and jabbed across the paper. Visitors and tourists looked on, alarmed. Whatever he was doing - a kind of mad writing - appeared to have little to do with the masterpieces on the walls. Unless I am mistaken, this was Frank Auerbach, responding to an El Greco on loan from New York's Metropolitan Museum. </p> <p>Auerbach, like many British artists, treats the National Gallery as a resource, returning time and again to study and rework its masterpieces. He is now one of the artists in Encounters: New Art From Old, which opened to the public yesterday. This is the National's ambitious attempt to link current international art with the old masters, with 25 leading names asked to make works inspired by its collection. </p> <p>Art works are always both homage to and critique of the works that preceded them. There is no art work I can think of that does not bear some relationship to prior art. Manners change, intentions belong to a particular epoch and mentality, techniques and skills are lost and found. </p> <p>Maybe the past and the present are capable of bearing witness to one another, in some curious unwitting dialogue. Auerbach's 1997-8 painting of Park Village East, close by Regent's Park, and Constable's Hay-Wain, with its carter crossing the Suffolk Stour, share the massing of trees on the left, a similar orientation of perspective, closeness and distance. There is a kind of reciprocation at work - as though one could trace each image in the lineaments of the other, substituting the poles of streetlights for elms, cars for a cart, a No Entry sign for a rotted stump by the river. But I am untouched by Auerbach's oblique transliteration. </p> <p>In the 18th century, Constable and Turner both took from Claude and made of him very different things. Ian Hamilton Finlay, in Encounters, honours Claude too, in a visual poem and photographs of his Scottish garden at Little Sparta, where Claude's name is carved in stone. Ingres's drawings, meanwhile, inspired David Hockney's portraits of the National Gallery's attendants. Picasso also paid homage to Ingres, often tracing photographs of his subjects, rather than drawing them directly, to imitate the cleanliness and spareness of Ingres's line. I'd rather look at Picasso or Ingres any day. The Hockneys are a pleasant footnote. </p> <p>Artists are surrounded by their peers and by their forebears. No artist can appreciate another's work with innocence. Jeff Wall takes a pop at George Stubbs, with a stage-managed light-box photograph of a Blackpool donkey in its stable. Champion the donkey carries children across the Blackpool sands on his back, while Stubbs's Whistlejacket, the prime racing stallion, is idealised against a blank background. Both animals have four legs, both give, or gave, pleasure. What more can be said? Wall's Donkey in Blackpool is a comment on class and breeding (the aristocracy of racehorses, the down-market appeal of the beach donkey), making somewhat the same point as Mark Wallinger in his earlier paintings of runners and jumpers. </p> <p>Some artists in Encounters cannot bear comparison with their models. What can be done with Rembrandt's Hendrickje Stoffels, hoisting up her night-shift as she wades in a stream? Antoni Tapies gives us a woman's back, as though rendered in cement, feet drawn in with an aerosol. Did he need the Rembrandt to make this work? How did it inspire him? What do the two works say to one another? The answers are, respectively: no; it didn't; nothing. </p> <p>RB Kitaj gets in a lather with Van Gogh, and the kind of people who didn't collect the artist in life, but push up the prices a century or so after his death. Kitaj, who now signs his paintings Ronald, sits a billionaire with a big cigar in Vincent's chair. It is a weak joke, and a weak yet angry painting. Both Stephen Cox and Anthony Caro aim for a kind of portentous architectural abstraction in their respective encounters with Duccio and Piero della Francesca. Cox's somnolent marble room is lucky to inhabit the same space as Louise Bourgeois' Cell XV (For Turner) and Bill Viola's response to Bosch's Christ Mocked (The Crowning of Thorns). Bourgeois' cell, with its mirrors, strange waterfall, lighting effects and shelves of jam-jars, is a peculiar response to the English landscape painter. \"Turner was obsessed by nature, and I am obsessed by human nature,\" she says. Weird light and water connect them. </p> <p>Bill Viola's slow-motion video, the Quintet of the Astonished, is a beautifully posed, lit and directed work. The five protagonists go through a gamut of expressions, touches and glances, each one a solitary within the group. As with his earlier slow-motion reworking of Pontormo, we are mesmerised by the fluid pacing of gestures and looks. It is wonderful. Where is Christ? The effect is like looking at how a painting unfolds in the mind of the spectator, and how memorable a tiny gesture can be. I suppose the model for this might be Bunuel's frozen moment, in the film Viridiana, when all the tramps at a dinner mimic exactly the composition of Leonardo's fresco of the Last Supper. </p> <p>Lucian Freud copies Chardin's The Young Schoolmistress unaffectedly, discovering Chardin in himself and himself in Chardin, rendering Chardin's sitters as though they were his own, living models. He attempts a close likeness, but we know this is Freud painting Chardin, discovering in the process that there is no such thing as a straightforward copy, or a true original. Freud comes at the question of originality crab-wise. The connection between Anselm Kiefer and Tintoretto's Origin of the Milky Way is both intellectual and poetic, a commentary that makes one read Tintoretto in the light of the poetry of Paul Celan, via Kiefer. Some might ask how Kiefer aligns Tintoretto with Celan's poetry of the Holocaust. </p> <p>The artist's business is the invention and reinvention of meaning. Everything and anything can be the artist's material. One of the things this exhibition does is wrest the works in the National Gallery back from the explainers, the interpreters and legitimators of art history, in favour of the creative process. Not that that is much evident in Howard Hodgkin's almost life-size transposition of Seurat's Bathers at Asni\u00e8res. While much of the show is housed in the temporary exhibition spaces of the Sainsbury Wing, Hodgkin and Seurat hang together in the permanent collection. The Hodgkin is horrible, a monument to folly. His high-key, splotched, blobbed, smeared painting lacks everything Seurat has. Hodgkin cannot compete; Seurat kills him. There is no more to be said. </p> <p>The status and value of contemporary art worry many people. If we didn't already have an idea what art is, we wouldn't have a clue as to whether the things we look at are art or not. History informs the present, but it is no judge. It wasn't made to judge, even if some works remain unsurpassable. You have to fight them on your own ground, honour them where you can. Encounters is an exhibition of successes and failures, but it is a brave attempt, and should be repeated. </p> <p>Encounters is at the National Gallery, London WC2 (020-7747 2885), till September 17.</p>",

      "byline": "Judith Mackrell",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p> Marius Petipa's Sleeping Beauty is the quintessence of aristocratic poise and purity; out of all the classics, it has most resisted the fantasies and depredations of modern producers. Only the very crass or brilliantly imaginative have dared to muddy its story with Freudian interpretation or political ideology (unlike the wilder, more romantic Swan Lake). So, watching Beauty today, we tend to regard the spectacle on stage as a pretty direct reflection of 19th-century classicism. </p> <p>The Kirov's enthralling reconstruction of the original 1890 staging shows us how wrong we are. When the curtain opens on the Prologue, with its heavily ornamented set, its milling retinues of fairies and nobles and its blissful riot of costumes, we understand what it is like to time-travel back to the ballet of Petipa's era. This production, at the Royal Opera House, is three times more populated and 100 times more extravagant than modern-day stagings, which by comparison seem like dull parties where only half the guests have shown up. </p> <p>The Kirov's previous Beauty was much the same, but when the company came to mount a new production, Ballet director Makhar Vaziev was determined to discover some of the work's authentic style. He was directed back to 312 pages of early notation (recorded in St Petersburg but smuggled out of revolutionary Russia and subsequently housed in Harvard) and to extensive photographic records of the original staging. Although companies in the West have based productions on the notation, the choreography, especially the mime, has been edited over the years to suit new dancers and audiences. The original costumes, too, have been streamlined for today's more athletic movers. So this new/old Beauty is as much of a revelation to us as it was to the Russians. </p> <p>With a cast of 157, it's not only bigger and more lavish but far more leisurely than the work we're used to. Huge crowds of characters - court, peasant and fairy tale - process around the stage, taking all the time they need to show off their costumes and converse in the quaintly-emphatic gestures of 19th century mime. Rather than looking creaky and cumbersome, this pantomimic version makes much better sense of the choreography. We always knew Petipa was a whizz at mobilising his dancers, orchestrating them into dense patterns, then thinning them out to frame brief, dazzling solos. But with all these extra performers the full grandeur of his scheme becomes obvious: the textures of his composition are more intricate, the processionals have a new weight and grandeur, and the solos emerge from the choruses with a more seamless, musical rhythm. </p> <p>The ballet's story also becomes more poetic and more believable. In our spare modern productions, the action takes place in a depopulated world where the delicate drama looks forced. Here there is life and variety. Aurora's birthday party, for instance, is set in the palace grounds (rather than the formal ballroom we're accustomed to) and the early summer leaves and flowers create a proper pastoral context for the famous Rose Adagio. There are so many guests at this party we're no longer surprised that Aurora can be handed the fateful needle unseen. Usually her parents seem to be ignoring Carabosse's interventions in a bizarre attack of parental myopia. In this production, they're credibly distracted by the huge crowd. </p> <p>A production that sells itself on authenticity may sound like fun for only a handful of scholars and ballet fanatics, but its four hours pass much more quickly than most of the slicker three hour versions. There is so much to look at, and it changes so rapidly (particularly when driven by the glorious brio of the Mariinsky orchestra), while the costumes alone (500 of them) are worth the trip; even though they have been modified to suit a modern build and technique, they still look like an old photo album come to vivid life. The colours rewrite the rule book and the detailing is sublime. The Lilac Fairy in her floral wreaths and helmet is particularly unmissable - an adorable cross between Britannia and Bo Peep. </p> <p>The least pleasing element is the dancing, which on Monday was technically adroit but stylistically limited. Diana Vishneva's Aurora moved with a scintillating speed but failed to modulate into tenderness or grandeur. Igor Zelensky as her Prince did his usual star turn with the steps but seemed to have his mind on his next engagement. This, however, is a rare Kirov show where the dancing isn't the central issue. The star is the production itself and, as with all the greatest stars, the world tilts on its axis when you see it.</p> <p> Sleeping Beauty is in rep at the Royal Opera House, London WC2 (020-7304 4000), till August 10.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Marius Petipa's Sleeping Beauty is the quintessence of aristocratic poise and purity; out of all the classics, it has most resisted the fantasies and depredations of modern producers. Only the very crass or brilliantly imaginative have dared to muddy its story with Freudian interpretation or political ideology (unlike the wilder, more romantic Swan Lake). So, watching Beauty today, we tend to regard the spectacle on stage as a pretty direct reflection of 19th-century classicism. The Kirov's enthralling reconstruction of the original 1890 staging shows us how wrong we are. When the curtain opens on the Prologue, with its heavily ornamented set, its milling retinues of fairies and nobles and its blissful riot of costumes, we understand what it is like to time-travel back to the ballet of Petipa's era. This production, at the Royal Opera House, is three times more populated and 100 times more extravagant than modern-day stagings, which by comparison seem like dull parties where only half the guests have shown up. The Kirov's previous Beauty was much the same, but when the company came to mount a new production, Ballet director Makhar Vaziev was determined to discover some of the work's authentic style. He was directed back to 312 pages of early notation (recorded in St Petersburg but smuggled out of revolutionary Russia and subsequently housed in Harvard) and to extensive photographic records of the original staging. Although companies in the West have based productions on the notation, the choreography, especially the mime, has been edited over the years to suit new dancers and audiences. The original costumes, too, have been streamlined for today's more athletic movers. So this new/old Beauty is as much of a revelation to us as it was to the Russians. With a cast of 157, it's not only bigger and more lavish but far more leisurely than the work we're used to. Huge crowds of characters - court, peasant and fairy tale - process around the stage, taking all the time they need to show off their costumes and converse in the quaintly-emphatic gestures of 19th century mime. Rather than looking creaky and cumbersome, this pantomimic version makes much better sense of the choreography. We always knew Petipa was a whizz at mobilising his dancers, orchestrating them into dense patterns, then thinning them out to frame brief, dazzling solos. But with all these extra performers the full grandeur of his scheme becomes obvious: the textures of his composition are more intricate, the processionals have a new weight and grandeur, and the solos emerge from the choruses with a more seamless, musical rhythm. The ballet's story also becomes more poetic and more believable. In our spare modern productions, the action takes place in a depopulated world where the delicate drama looks forced. Here there is life and variety. Aurora's birthday party, for instance, is set in the palace grounds (rather than the formal ballroom we're accustomed to) and the early summer leaves and flowers create a proper pastoral context for the famous Rose Adagio. There are so many guests at this party we're no longer surprised that Aurora can be handed the fateful needle unseen. Usually her parents seem to be ignoring Carabosse's interventions in a bizarre attack of parental myopia. In this production, they're credibly distracted by the huge crowd. A production that sells itself on authenticity may sound like fun for only a handful of scholars and ballet fanatics, but its four hours pass much more quickly than most of the slicker three hour versions. There is so much to look at, and it changes so rapidly (particularly when driven by the glorious brio of the Mariinsky orchestra), while the costumes alone (500 of them) are worth the trip; even though they have been modified to suit a modern build and technique, they still look like an old photo album come to vivid life. The colours rewrite the rule book and the detailing is sublime. The Lilac Fairy in her floral wreaths and helmet is particularly unmissable - an adorable cross between Britannia and Bo Peep. The least pleasing element is the dancing, which on Monday was technically adroit but stylistically limited. Diana Vishneva's Aurora moved with a scintillating speed but failed to modulate into tenderness or grandeur. Igor Zelensky as her Prince did his usual star turn with the steps but seemed to have his mind on his next engagement. This, however, is a rare Kirov show where the dancing isn't the central issue. The star is the production itself and, as with all the greatest stars, the world tilts on its axis when you see it. Sleeping Beauty is in rep at the Royal Opera House, London WC2 (020-7304 4000), till August 10.",

When Duke Ellington was 12, he and his mates took girls to the reservoir banks, in hearing distance of each other, to see \"who did the greater job as a man\". The marker was noise. \"If the girl's reaction was loud, he was a great fucker because the chick was hollering 'Baby, I'm coming', all that shit.\" Competition was hot: \"Some cats pinched the chicks to make them holler.

From \"ma man don't love me and he treats me oh so mean\" to Mozart's countess in Figaro lamenting her husband's faithlessness, men have written songs that defined the female voice as vulnerable. Hurt by a man. Longing for him. Abandoned. \"The problem with operas,\" Glyndebourne director Graham Vick says, \"is they're written by men full of notions that women can't live without them.\"</p> <p>I wanted to write a book about what effect this might have on women making music now. Most women, singers or listeners, have in their heads thousands of songs written by men, which seem to express women's feelings. Bessie Smith, Billie Holiday and Edith Piaf did write songs, but until the 70s (give or take trailblazers like Janis Joplin), women mostly sang men's songs and sounded how men wanted them to sound. The difference between women's love songs and men's was that women's were by the people they were about. Carly Simon took off that tradition in You're So Vain (1972). But the trouble with singing \"Bet you think this song is about you, don't you?\" is ... he's right.</p> <p>Researching the book, I talked to singers, composers, directors and got the performer's answer - that your job is to feel a song's sentiments until they are your own. \"Bessie Smith takes a lyric and makes it like she wrote it,\" Marianne Faithfull said.</p> <p>When Josephine Barstow sang Violetta in Verdi's Traviata, was she ware of serving a man's idea of a woman's feelings? \"I couldn't look at it that way,\" she says. \"If I think: 'I'm expressing Verdi's desire, not Violetta's', it's not going to work. I have to express Violetta's feeling, try to work out where she's at.\"</p> <p>Singers can't afford to distance themselves from the song. \"It never bothered me,\" Faithfull says, \"that songs were written from a man's point of view. I don't believe gender's important in a song.\"</p> <p>But if women singers and listeners are so used to identifying with men's ideas of how they feel, how can they know how their own feelings sound? Wouldn't their songs follow suit and highlight the vulnerable voice men have given women for centuries?</p> <p>To an extent, they did. Until the 70s, most women in pop worked, more or less, with man-made ideas of how women sound. What changed everything was punk. Overnight, lyric content was transformed. You got songs about cigarettes, murderers, traffic lights, masturbation. And when punk blew every stereotype to bits, ideas of voice changed, too. \"Oh bondage, up yours,\" screeched Poly Styrene, whose name challenged the artificiality of how women look and sound. \"I am a clich\u00e9.\" She and Siouxsie Sioux had a lasting effect. \"Siouxsie made me feel things were possible,\" Shirley Manson of Garbage says.</p> <p>The punk ethos also brought technical changes. Up to the 80s, most women guitarists used a folk stroke, down-up. Rock style is everything on a down stroke, which makes the music more precise, urgent, aggressive. After punk, women began to switch. Early Elastica played folk-stroke, loose and floppy. When they used a rock right hand, the music sounded different. Sharper edge, sharper beat.</p> <p>But women were up against something bigger than guitar technique. Above all, there was that rhythm thing. Beat is the heart of rock and roll, and the core of male sexuality. \"Male ecstasy in performance starts here,\" Patti Smith said in 1978, jerking at an imaginary penis. \"Building and building till the big spurt at the end.\"</p> <p>Rock 'n' roll was first made by men to express, basically, being a man. The Stones took their name from Muddy Waters: \"I'm a man, I'm a rolling stone.\" The astonishing thing about music in the 50s and 60s was the blatant staging of male sexuality. Male self-myths seem to be coded into the chords and style: the dreams of being a hero, violent, omnipotent and dark. The main challenge faced by women in rock is the maleness of their medium.</p> <p>\"There's this huge fuss about women in rock,\" Manson says, \"but I don't feel anything has changed. The whole industry is run by men. How can you change an attitude and an atmosphere? It's nonsense.\"</p> <p>Rock's classic sexual politics mean \"powerful sexy men and girls on their knees sucking off the stage-hand for a glimpse of God\", as a Courtney Love fan put it. There are no male groupies. \"I've never been approached and I've never met a female star who has,\" Chrissie Hynde insists.</p> <p>This imbalance gives women's work the edge. Rock has always got its energy from challenge. One reason some of the best rock around today is by women is that they make their response to rock maleness their starting point. Women like Kristin Hersh, PJ Harvey and Shirley Manson handle voice or guitar or lyrics differently from pre-punk musicians. Everything is stronger: challenging, not a victim voice. Manson says she likes Hynde's voice because \"it's vulnerable and strong\".</p> <p>Perhaps you can best illustrate the problems of women's lyrical relation to male rock tradition by how you hold a guitar. What should women do? You play best higher, but it looks wrong. If you hold it crotch-level, you're imitating men. As for breasts, do you go for one squashed, the other hanging over? Since punk and especially since the early 90s, women have just flung away the worry and got on with it - brilliantly. Voice and stroke, stance and lyrics. Women rockers are a great example of women taking male tradition somewhere new. And maybe it's the first time women are making a sound to express not what men have said they experience but what they really feel.<br><br> Ruth Padel's I'm A Man: Sex, Gods and Rock 'n' Roll is published by Faber on July 10 at \u00a312.99.</p>",

First catcalls from the formidable doyennes of the WI, now a survey from thomascook.com names him as the man women would least like to take on holiday. I'm not a huge fan of our prime minister, but I have to say that this seems a little harsh. He'd rub in your sun cream, wouldn't he? He'd pay his way, he wouldn't show off in the pool, he'd never get bladdered on sangria.

I'm way to the left of Jack Straw on \"bogus\" asylum seekers (I'd far rather live in a country that's besieged by asylum seekers than one from which you'd want to seek asylum). I don't object to higher taxes. I voted for Tony Blair in the full expectation that he would wring my paycheck until it squealed.

And disenfranchised, which is worse. Tony Blair is a weathercock, a trimmer and a poltroon, a faker who can't control his own soppy suburbanite backbenchers, a man without any principle except that of re-election.

      "bodyText": "The supermarket chain Iceland yesterday raised the stakes in the store wars by announcing it is to switch its entire own brand frozen vegetable range to organic - at no extra cost to the consumer. The company claimed to have bought up nearly 40% of the world's organic vegetable supplies to meet the growing demand from customers. It is paying farmers around the world between 10% and 25% more over three-year contracts, and will cut \u00a38m from its profit margins to avoid charging higher prices. The aggressive marketing move follows the company's non-GM policy and decision to remove artificial colouring and flavouring from own-brand products. The policy will mean 2lb bags of frozen vegetables will remain under \u00a31.50, and frozen peas at \u00a31.19. Supermarket competitors reacted coolly, saying Iceland was a late entrant into the organic stakes, and only accounted for 1% of organic sales. The company admits that it is starting its all-organic policy in an area where large-scale industrial production can spread the extra costs of going organic. Frozen vegetables account for between 5% and 10% of Iceland's \u00a31.9bn annual turnover and nearly all of them are own brand. Iceland accounts for 15% of Britain's frozen vegetable sales The switch on green vegetables, such as broccoli and peas, should take place in October, with potato products such as chips following early next year. Other products, such as ice-cream, milk, cheese, yoghurt, bread, fresh fruit and vegetables and some meats, are being considered for \"organic only\" treatment. Most of the produce will at first come from Europe, the US and central America, and fears were already being expressed last night that the continuing rise in organic sales, though still only a tiny fraction of the \u00a372.5bn annual food bill, was outstripping government funded initiatives to increase organic agriculture at home. Iceland's chairman and chief executive, Malcolm Walker, said: \"Ethically and morally we are happy to be fighting for better food. Commercially it makes sense as well. \"The market is expected to grow at 40% over the next five years. We are giving the customers a choice of buying natural organic food at affordable prices. \"We don't believe the size of your pay packet should dictate the quality of the food you eat. The problem is that the organic market at the moment is still a cottage industry, in terms of supply , and at the retail end it is quite specialist.\" Iceland is giving the National Trust \u00a31m to help pay for new green measures on its 700 farms , including converting more to organic status. The company is among groups lobbying MPs and the government for more support for organic conversion. State aid in England is to rise from \u00a311.5m to \u00a323m a year by 2004, although ministers have hinted the spending review this summer might yield more funds. A number of backbenchers want to see an organic target of 30% of farmland (10 times the present level), and 20% of organic food consumed in the UK reached by 2010. Iceland's announcement follows the government's admission that it cannot prevent cross-contamination of conventional or organic crops by genetically modified crops being given trials in Britain. The move will raise the political heat on ministers who are perceived as favouring the new technology above organic methods. Sainsbury's, which sells more than \u00a33m worth of organic food a week , said it already sold 650 organic lines, and was working with farmers in Grenada and St Lucia to develop a market for organic exotic fruits. But the company was sceptical about Iceland's claim that its 35,000 tonnes of orders for fresh vegetables represented 40% of the organic supply worldwide and said it had difficulty in obtaining any international figures for organic production. Tesco, which believes it will be selling \u00a3200m of organic products this year, said: \"Iceland is catching up on organics. They are a long way behind.\" But Patrick Holden, director of the Soil Association, said: \"Iceland has made a bold move to make organic products much more available to thousands of consumers who have not had them before.\" Market that shows signs of growth \u0095 Britons ate an estimated\u00a3546m worth of organic food last year. This is expected to nearly treble by April 2003. \u0095 About one in three Britons buys some organic food. Germans already eat an estimated \u00a31.5bn of organic food. \u0095 70% of organic food in Britain is sold in supermarkets. \u0095 70% is imported. The figure rises to over 80% for fruit and vegetables, while nearly all eggs and meat are home grown. \u0095 Organic foods can cost up to twice as much as conventionally produced ones, especially meat.

When they watch, they read. When we watch, we slob. These are alarming findings for a country blessed with what is fast becoming the global language. But we should not simply blame the TV: for that is surely a symptom rather than a cause of our flight from words. We should look instead at another OECD finding: 26% of Britons leave school within a year of ending compulsory education. In Australia the figure is 3%. We need to stay in school longer and read more books. In the words of the Americans, we also need to get out more.",

The courts are barely functioning and the police almost entirely foreign, unable to speak the language and ignorant of the law. The UN cannot pull out immediately, but the people want to run their own affairs, police, courts and we cannot refuse this for too long - even if a few KLA thugs do get too much power. The Serbs have nearly all gone (the official figure of 95,000 remaining is certainly exaggerated) and will not be back for some years, no matter what we do.</p> <p>The first thing the UN must do is to settle the constitutional status: until then the Albanians fear the West will pull out and leave the Serbs to march back in.

The tragedy is that, along with the demobilisers who were expelled, so too were those providing lifesaving humanitarian aid. Large parts of the country are now beyond the reach of agencies such as Medecins Sans Frontieres. Last week, for example, MSF was forced to suspend its work in Kabala, leaving the entire northern district with no hospital care. Frances Stevenson Medecins Sans Frontieres UK Lesley Abdela is right (Vote for chaos, Jun 13). It is too early to have elections in Kosovo. The country is still effectively under military occupation by foreign soldiers, police, administrators, aid workers etc, with most of the country inaccessible to Serbs and the remaining parts mostly inaccessible to Kosovar Albanians. The courts are barely functioning and the police almost entirely foreign, unable to speak the language and ignorant of the law. The UN cannot pull out immediately, but the people want to run their own affairs, police, courts and we cannot refuse this for too long - even if a few KLA thugs do get too much power. The Serbs have nearly all gone (the official figure of 95,000 remaining is certainly exaggerated) and will not be back for some years, no matter what we do. The first thing the UN must do is to settle the constitutional status: until then the Albanians fear the West will pull out and leave the Serbs to march back in. Until the fiction that Kosovo is part of Serbia is ended, there can be no hope for peace and democracy.

The Autonomous Marine Environmental Research Stations project (AutoMERS) is sending \"Landers\" - unmanned autonomous robots - down to the ocean floor to discover what lives there. </p> <p>\"I found it a really interesting experience, meeting these bizarre animals - up until then I'd only seen pictures in books,\" says Dr Julian Partridge, from the University of Bristol describing his first experience of deep sea trawling. He is one of the scientists collaborating on AutoMERS, but his fascination with marine life began over 13 years ago when he met deep sea fish for the first time. His main interest is how anything sees anything down there. </p> <p>Light from the sun filters through the sea for about 1,000 metres. Any light in the blackness below will be faint blue. Sea water allows only the blue bit of the spectrum through; there's also the odd spot of bioluminescence produced by the creatures themselves. Not only is there little light, the pressure is immense, about 450 times atmospheric pressure at 4,500 metres. \"At school we're taught that liquids and solids are not compressible but that's only an approximation; liquids and solids are compressible,\" says Patridge, \"and when you're living at the depths these animals are living at, some of their proteins do literally get squashed into different shapes.\" </p> <p>The fish have to redesign proteins such as enzymes so they will work even when squashed; without enzymes to help them digest food, the fish would starve. Pressure doesn't seem to affect their eyes, but sight is a problem. </p> <p>\"Designing an eye that is required to work in a world which is black with small dots of light, is one of the mysteries,\" says Partridge. How do fish tell whether one of these small dots of light is moving towards them or away from them, when they can't see anything else? It's just one of many riddles the scientists still haven't solved. Until now Partridge has tended to gather his fish by trawling the deep sea with nets. Normal deep sea fishing trawls at 200m; to plunge down to 4,000 odd metres, he needs up to 14 kilometres of wire. </p> <p>Dr Ron Douglas, from City University, London, who works with Partridge, says, \"Deep sea research is like an alien spaceship flying over New York City dragging a net the size of a soccer goal for half an hour. What the alien gets is what that it takes as a sample of life on earth.\" </p> <p>What Partridge has discovered in his alien hauls are several hundred different kinds of fish from the sea floor: 90% of them see in a similar way: they emit a faint blue light from specialised cells called photoreceptors, and they have blue sensitive rods in their eyes. </p> <p>We have cones, cells in our eyes which respond to colour, and rods that help us see at night. As far as anyone can tell, with only one kind of rod, these fish don't have colour vision. But an unusual family of fish, the dragonfish, see in a unique way. \"Malacosteus niger is a rather wonderful fish, it has huge teeth and a bright red eye - it's very distinctive,\" says Patridge. It emits a red light which acts like a sniper's rifle, allowing it to illuminate other fish. Since fish can see only blue light, they're unaware of the predator's beam. </p> <p>M.niger can see its own red light because of a rather weird set-up. Inside each eye are bacteria which produce chlorophyll, the green matter that allows plants to photosynthesise. The adapted form of chlorophyll responds to light allowing the fish to see red. The fish are actually seeing into the far end of the visual spectrum; it's not quite infra-red light but it is far enough away from the normal end of red for us to be unable to see it. </p> <p>Partridge thinks the fish must eat the bacteria and somehow it ends up in their eye. But no one knows quite how or why. The dragonfish uses the red light to hunt, but when frightened it flashes blue-green light. Partridge is hoping the Landers will help him understand what the fish are signalling and why. The AutoMERS project, which is overseen by Professor Imants Priede at Aberdeen University, deployed the Landers for the first time last October and measured the amount of bioluminescence in the ocean. </p> <p>Bait was provided to attract deep sea fish, and their bioluminescence was recorded. This resulted in a large quantity of flashing lights. Next time round lights and a camera will be attached to the Lander so that the researchers can actually see what kind of fish are flashing. \"They're interacting between species, and within species, to communicate in ways we can only guess at. But like a lot of communication, it's likely to be about sex and violence,\" says Partridge. </p> <p>Partridge has also been studying communication in birds. It seems many male birds signal their status and attractiveness with plumage displays that are visible only if you can see in ultraviolet. </p> <p>\"It seems like a big step away from deep sea fish, but it's all part of my general interest in why animals have the colour vision systems they have, and recognition that we have a certain colour vision, but a lot of animals are doing something else,\" he explains. </p> <p>That birds had ultraviolet vision was actually discovered 30 years ago, but somehow this fact wasn't picked up by animal behaviourists. Along with Professor Innes Cuthill, also from Bristol University, Partridge was able to demonstrate that birds have six types of cones, two of which have an unknown function. The other four respond to red, blue, green, and ultra-violet light. In behavioural experiments, Partridge and Cuthill showed that birds use all four colours when they're choosing who to mate with or what to eat. When the scientists prevented the birds from seeing in ultraviolet, they chose different mates from those they chose when they had access to all four colours. </p> <p>\"Sadly I think this finding might have revolutionised the way we think about birds. I say that because the information, which basically says different animals see the world in different ways from the way we see it has been around since the sixties or seventies. So to take it right up to the end of 1990s for it to be rammed home is really an indication of the failure of scientists from one discipline to communicate effectively with scientists from another discipline,\" says Partridge. </p> <p>He adds: \"The take home message from the work is you mustn't think of animals as black boxes. You must think about the animal and how it evolved before you start coming to terribly important conclusions.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p> A possible future for the internet is that humans and computers will grow together to form what biologists might term a single symbiotic life-form. </p> <p>Such a setup exists between certain one-celled algae and a filamentous fungus forming a network which the algae inhabit. If one component dies, the other cannot survive. The compound creatures are called lichens. Only recently was it realised that they are not straightforward life-forms, but symbiotic compounds of two totally different forms. </p> <p>Neither are humans, and vertebrates generally, straightforward life-forms. Our cells contain actively metabolising bodies called mitochondria which are essential to our remaining alive. They are simplified remote descendants of archaic free-living bacteria. </p> <p>An evolutionary pattern that has been followed several times cannot be excluded as a possible model for humans and their rapidly evolving electronic partner. The only significant difference is that the internet is not a life-form. But it has many features in common with life forms, including susceptibility to virus infections. </p> <p>Could the internet develop a consciousness of sorts? If so why, how, when, and what are the possible repercussions? </p> <p>If one thinks of the future human-internet complex as a single organism sustained by the symbiosis of ancestrally different components, then the answer has to be \"to a degree yes, since the participating human brains are assumed to be conscious\". But could the networked computers also attain some significant degree of \"corporate\" consciousness. - even purposes of its own? Both human and machine components might remain largely unaware of the goals and constraints governing the new super-agent's high- speed meditations. </p> <p>Most computer users would agree that if only computers could be programmed with a bit more of the equivalent of self-awareness, trying to communicate with them would be less frustrating. </p> <p>My Microsoft Windows, like everybody's, has such poor powers of introspective report on what it is doing, or failing to do, that I sometimes want to say: \"For God's sake talk sense. Concentrate, Thinkpad Junior! And stop repeating that error message. Repeating obvious nonsense doesn't make it true!\" </p> <p>Big software companies are aware of this problem. The following internal email originates from a Microsoft R &amp; D lab: \"The user interface group at Microsoft Research is working to develop an assistant-like interface... This project, which we're calling Persona, will try to produce the illusion of a conscious being in a machine.\" </p> <p>My own recent work in collaboration with Claude Sammut at the University of New South Wales is along this same line. An early stage is described in Putting A Personality In A PC in Online, June 23 1999. </p> <p>The individual PC user could certainly do with a fully fashioned intelligence under the bonnet, complete with consciousness, and certain natural-language skills. But a machine-type consciousness is what we chiefly want. At a pinch, we can always get human-type from tech support, although a little human-type gloss faked up by the machine would certainly enhance the user's comfort. It would be nice if he or she could say, free-style: \"But can you tell me more about just where you're hurting? I do hope you still feel OK in your file allocation table area!\" </p> <p>Consciousness here means introspective rumination, self-report, question-answering about goals, and articulation by the machine of its own decisions and states. </p> <p>Shallow consciousness (faked-up human-type) already has an avid commercial market, addressed by the rise of the chatbots. These programs are fun, but also have serious roles, as in computer-aided language learning. Web-based facilities for \"Practice your English conversation skills\" could, if coherent enough, become a world-wide draw. </p> <p> Back, then, to the internet question. Could the net itself become self-aware by summation of the mutual awarenesses of its constituent electronic and biological agents? </p> <p>There is a Catch 22. </p> <p>If it doesn't become self-aware it will, through insufficient transparency, become impossible to regulate. If it does, then we may have to watch out - not for some sinister Big Brother centralisation but almost the opposite. I see a possible fragmentation, centred around warring bio-cybernetic empires. Giant multi-national man-computer complexes could wage the global competition game until the playing field is exhausted. Not a pretty sight in anyone's crystal ball! </p> <p>Anyone's crystal ball can be wrong, and usually is. But perhaps it's time to begin setting up markers against which to monitor possible shapes of our global future. </p> <p>\u0095 Donald Michie is Professor Emeritus of machine intelligence at the University of Edinburgh</p>",

An evolutionary pattern that has been followed several times cannot be excluded as a possible model for humans and their rapidly evolving electronic partner. The only significant difference is that the internet is not a life-form. But it has many features in common with life forms, including susceptibility to virus infections. Could the internet develop a consciousness of sorts? If so why, how, when, and what are the possible repercussions? If one thinks of the future human-internet complex as a single organism sustained by the symbiosis of ancestrally different components, then the answer has to be \"to a degree yes, since the participating human brains are assumed to be conscious\". But could the networked computers also attain some significant degree of \"corporate\" consciousness. - even purposes of its own? Both human and machine components might remain largely unaware of the goals and constraints governing the new super-agent's high- speed meditations. Most computer users would agree that if only computers could be programmed with a bit more of the equivalent of self-awareness, trying to communicate with them would be less frustrating. My Microsoft Windows, like everybody's, has such poor powers of introspective report on what it is doing, or failing to do, that I sometimes want to say: \"For God's sake talk sense. Concentrate, Thinkpad Junior! And stop repeating that error message. Repeating obvious nonsense doesn't make it true!\" Big software companies are aware of this problem. The following internal email originates from a Microsoft R &amp; D lab: \"The user interface group at Microsoft Research is working to develop an assistant-like interface... This project, which we're calling Persona, will try to produce the illusion of a conscious being in a machine.\" My own recent work in collaboration with Claude Sammut at the University of New South Wales is along this same line. An early stage is described in Putting A Personality In A PC in Online, June 23 1999. The individual PC user could certainly do with a fully fashioned intelligence under the bonnet, complete with consciousness, and certain natural-language skills. But a machine-type consciousness is what we chiefly want. At a pinch, we can always get human-type from tech support, although a little human-type gloss faked up by the machine would certainly enhance the user's comfort. It would be nice if he or she could say, free-style: \"But can you tell me more about just where you're hurting? I do hope you still feel OK in your file allocation table area!\" Consciousness here means introspective rumination, self-report, question-answering about goals, and articulation by the machine of its own decisions and states. Shallow consciousness (faked-up human-type) already has an avid commercial market, addressed by the rise of the chatbots. These programs are fun, but also have serious roles, as in computer-aided language learning. Web-based facilities for \"Practice your English conversation skills\" could, if coherent enough, become a world-wide draw. Back, then, to the internet question. Could the net itself become self-aware by summation of the mutual awarenesses of its constituent electronic and biological agents? There is a Catch 22. If it doesn't become self-aware it will, through insufficient transparency, become impossible to regulate. If it does, then we may have to watch out - not for some sinister Big Brother centralisation but almost the opposite. I see a possible fragmentation, centred around warring bio-cybernetic empires. Giant multi-national man-computer complexes could wage the global competition game until the playing field is exhausted. Not a pretty sight in anyone's crystal ball! Anyone's crystal ball can be wrong, and usually is. But perhaps it's time to begin setting up markers against which to monitor possible shapes of our global future. \u0095 Donald Michie is Professor Emeritus of machine intelligence at the University of Edinburgh",

The game remains a fantastically compulsive trip into Game Boy addiction, but unfortunately it's one that most of us will have already taken. </p> <p><strong>Not worth the long, long wait</strong><br> Daikatana PC <br> \u00a339.99 Ion Storm/Eidos <br> There's an old gag about a Russian man ordering a new TV. \"We'll deliver it on April 8 2011.\" </p> <p>\"Morning or afternoon?\" </p> <p>\"Afternoon. Why?\" </p> <p>\"The plumber's coming in the morning.\" </p> <p>People were starting to joke about Daikatana in the same way. In the course of three years, it's missed about a dozen different release dates (some of then promised as little as a week before) and suffered countless setbacks. </p> <p>Of course, this happens to lots of games (albeit never to quite this extent). The reason for the added fuss this time is that Daikatana is the brainchild of John Romero, he of Wolfenstein, Doom, Heretic, Hexen and Quake fame. </p> <p>Romero's specific contribution to those games is unclear; after seeing this, I think he made the tea because very little of this first-person shooter is worth the three-year wait. </p> <p>It claims two \"unique\" selling points. The first is its use of teamplay (as seen in SWAT); as well as total control of the hero, Hiro, you have limited influence over two sidekicks, Mikiko and Super fly Johnson (will Superfly really be a trendy moniker in 500 years' time?), whom you can instruct to stay, come, back off, attack or pick up an object. </p> <p>You also, unfortunately, have to keep them alive for the duration of the game, and sharing out the game's limited resources between three adds unwanted complexity to an already demanding experience. </p> <p>The second innovation is time travel (as seen in Day Of the Tentacle). On a quest to recover an ancient mystical sword, Hiro and friends travel through four different time periods, each subdivided into six levels. In a pleasing touch, each era features not just its own enemies but also its own unique weapons. However, since gameplay is so linear, the time aspect is superficial. </p> <p>The most refreshing thing about Daikatana is its unfolding story; rather than just endless levels of increasingly hard combat, cut scenes and in-game developments add a sense of progress. You can also convert experience points into increased speed, power, attack speed, vitality or height of jump. </p> <p>It's hard to believe that the graphics needed three years' development. In spite of the game's cheekily high specifications (optimum configuration: Pentium III 500MHz+, 32MB Open GL-compliant video card), the characters are blocky and blotchy, movement is jerky, and the colours, particularly on the opening level, tend to blend into a murky mess. </p> <p>This often makes it hard to see where enemies are coming from until they're right on top of you.Which leads us neatly on to the general difficulty level. Take the first level: 80+ bad guys, several nasty gun turrets, about seven health packs. And two saves allowed. (Save points. In a PC game. Now there's time travel for you.) And that's on the easy setting. </p> <p>Normally, game reviewers aim to complete as much of a game as they can, in order to give it the most comprehensive review possible. </p> <p>And here I must hold up my hands: I have failed. Mainly because, after several dozen attempts, I simply could not finish the first level. Limited saves, tough enemies, problematic aiming, little health... stuff that for a game of soldiers. (AB)</p> <p> <strong>The cutting edge of combat</strong><br><strong> Vagrant Story</strong><br> Sony PlayStation \u00a329.99 Square <br> This is the kind of combat I like best: push a button and your opponent freezes. </p> <p>Now you can take your time selecting exactly where to hit him or it, with the help of a read-out that tells you how much damage will be inflicted. And if the enemy strikes back, you can take a potion to restore your health. </p> <p>Which is not to imply that fighting is a minor part of Vagrant Story, which is released on June 23. </p> <p>It's an adventure role-playing game (RPG), much of which takes place in a series of underground rooms. Whenever you enter a room, have a sword handy, even if it's only to slash nasty bats. </p> <p>Getting from room to room often involves solving little puzzles, which often involve moving boxes around. Luckily this is all very engaging, because the plot seems to have been inspired by a Japanese comic book about medieval myth and magic. </p> <p>Briefly, you play Ashley Riot, a member of the Valendia Knights of Peace's Riskbreaker squad. There are also Knights of the Crimson Blade, led by Romeo Guildenstern, who are fighting the Mullenkamp Cult, led by Sydney Losstarot. What it all means is a mystery - I'd be interested to read the novella. But as long as you follow the arrows and keep killing things, none of it seems to matter. </p> <p>And it must be said that Vagrant Story is a luscious piece of work with beautifully integrated cut scenes. Almost every wall is a graphical masterpiece, and the 3D camera lets you explore each miniature scene: it's amazing that a PlayStation game can look this good. The sound effects are superb, too. The only thing that's missing is the spoken word: the characters talk in comic-book medieval English in comic-book bubbles. </p> <p>If you want another epic like Final Fantasy, this isn't it. Nonetheless, it's a minor masterpiece. (JS)</p>",

The most refreshing thing about Daikatana is its unfolding story; rather than just endless levels of increasingly hard combat, cut scenes and in-game developments add a sense of progress. You can also convert experience points into increased speed, power, attack speed, vitality or height of jump. It's hard to believe that the graphics needed three years' development. In spite of the game's cheekily high specifications (optimum configuration: Pentium III 500MHz+, 32MB Open GL-compliant video card), the characters are blocky and blotchy, movement is jerky, and the colours, particularly on the opening level, tend to blend into a murky mess. This often makes it hard to see where enemies are coming from until they're right on top of you.Which leads us neatly on to the general difficulty level. Take the first level: 80+ bad guys, several nasty gun turrets, about seven health packs. And two saves allowed. (Save points. In a PC game. Now there's time travel for you.) And that's on the easy setting. Normally, game reviewers aim to complete as much of a game as they can, in order to give it the most comprehensive review possible. And here I must hold up my hands: I have failed. Mainly because, after several dozen attempts, I simply could not finish the first level. Limited saves, tough enemies, problematic aiming, little health... stuff that for a game of soldiers. (AB) The cutting edge of combat Vagrant Story Sony PlayStation \u00a329.99 Square This is the kind of combat I like best: push a button and your opponent freezes. Now you can take your time selecting exactly where to hit him or it, with the help of a read-out that tells you how much damage will be inflicted. And if the enemy strikes back, you can take a potion to restore your health. Which is not to imply that fighting is a minor part of Vagrant Story, which is released on June 23. It's an adventure role-playing game (RPG), much of which takes place in a series of underground rooms. Whenever you enter a room, have a sword handy, even if it's only to slash nasty bats. Getting from room to room often involves solving little puzzles, which often involve moving boxes around. Luckily this is all very engaging, because the plot seems to have been inspired by a Japanese comic book about medieval myth and magic. Briefly, you play Ashley Riot, a member of the Valendia Knights of Peace's Riskbreaker squad. There are also Knights of the Crimson Blade, led by Romeo Guildenstern, who are fighting the Mullenkamp Cult, led by Sydney Losstarot. What it all means is a mystery - I'd be interested to read the novella. But as long as you follow the arrows and keep killing things, none of it seems to matter. And it must be said that Vagrant Story is a luscious piece of work with beautifully integrated cut scenes. Almost every wall is a graphical masterpiece, and the 3D camera lets you explore each miniature scene: it's amazing that a PlayStation game can look this good. The sound effects are superb, too. The only thing that's missing is the spoken word: the characters talk in comic-book medieval English in comic-book bubbles. If you want another epic like Final Fantasy, this isn't it. Nonetheless, it's a minor masterpiece. (JS)",

But Bauer argues that \"speed is less important when people are used to dial-up connections, and Symphony is more than adequate. What's more important is the 'out of the box' experience, the ease of use.\" But Proxim expects to get regulatory approval to run its system at 10Mbps later, while retaining support for voice, which 802.11b lacks.

However, no Ethernet network ever runs at its theoretical maximum speed, and wireless network efficiency will vary with distance and the number of walls in the way. An 11Mbps connection will probably work at about half that speed and may fall back to 2Mbps or even 1Mbps. But if this sounds pessimistic, in tests using Proxim's Symphony equipment, we were able to work more than 200ft from the house and still connect a laptop to the internet via the home network. </p> <p>Installing a wireless (or any other) network usually means opening your desktop PC to plug in an expansion card, though with notebook PCs and smaller machines, it's simply a matter of inserting a PC/ PCMCIA Card. Intel's AnyPoint range is different because it uses a USB (Universal Serial Bus) connector: plug in the external box and you have a 1.6Mbps wireless network. Access Points - base stations or hubs - may also be added to manage the communications on a wireless network and to connect networks together. </p> <p>Most wireless products will work with whatever internet connection you have, whether it's an ISDN card, DSL or just a dial-up modem. In other words, if you invest in a wireless network - and they're not cheap - it won't become obsolete when you get a faster internet connection. </p> <p>Microsoft Windows CE machines and PocketPCs have wireless networking capabilities built in. Some handhelds simply can't be connected into wireless PC networks, but later they may be able to connect to mobile phones and other devices using Bluetooth, a short-range wireless system that uses the same 2.54GHz waveband. </p> <p>Bluetooth isn't a networking standard in the same way as IEEE 802.11, and has been designed mainly for point-to-point communications with one device at a time. However, Bluetooth devices will be able to form \"ad hoc\" networks so the two systems will overlap to some extent. </p> <p>Cisco's Milne reckons that the fixed channel Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum wireless technology used by Cisco/Aironet and similar products is better for the job than the frequency hopping approach adopted for Bluetooth and also used by Proxim's Symphony.

And if that's not enough, NT has dumped its memory to disk so you can send it to Microsoft so they can tell you what the problem is. Since I've been reading the blue screens rather than just resetting I've resolved all the problems that caused crashes and none have them have been the OS's fault. Mike Tipping mike.tipping@dps-int.com Bill Gates and his Microsoft team have brought untold benefit to the world. Did George Stephenson attract similar snide hostility with his steam railway engine, or Alexander Bell with his telephone? Philip A.Millard hog@ogauge.co.uk",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>\u0095It's a rare thing that the Diary receives press statements from the Royal Ulster Constabulary, let alone reprints one. But here, in an historic first, is the full text: \"Following inaccurate media coverage of an incident in which an RUC drugs dog is alleged to have snapped at the Secretary of State [Peter Mandelson], the dog's handler wishes to make it absolutely clear that the encounter between the secretary of state and Sky, the labrador, was completely friendly.\" Absolutely. Readers may recall that the Diary yesterday quoted RUC Inspector Tom Crawford, an eyewitness to the incident when O'Mandy tried to stroke the black labrador bitch: \"She can be a wee bit cross if you get too close, and I think the secretary of state found that out when she bared her teeth at him.\" But no - according to the RUC: \"The meeting between the secretary of state and Sky was amicable and the dog handler and the secretary of state had an enjoyable conversation about their mutual interest in labrador dogs.\" Anxious to maintain his dog-friendly image as proud owner of Bobby, the lovable golden retriever, O'Mandy also issued his own rebuttal (although he seems confused about Sky's sex). \"At no point did he snarl, growl or bare his teeth,\" O'Mandy said. \"I and his handler then had a perfectly amicable conversation.\" There are some things you couldn't make up, even if your brain was erased with mind rubbers.</p> <p>\u0095Our plans to rescue the England football team (by getting has-been Alan Shearer interred in a donkey sanctuary) having fallen down, we turn to the Diary Vicar, the Rev Steve Chalke. My colleague Esther Galan asks Steve if he can suggest suitable prayers, and he turns to the Old Testament (Isaiah, 35: 3,4). \"Strengthen the feeble hands. Steady the knees that give way.\" Amen. And with Shearer's injuries in mind, Steve suggests appealing to St Roch, the patron saint of knee problems. But since St Roch was French, English prayers are better directed to St Giles, patron saint of cripples.</p> <p>\u0095Mystery surrounds poor Sarah Macaulay, \"companion\" of Gordon Brown. Sarah appeared quite unhappy at Nick Brown's 50th birthday party at the Marquis of Granby pub on Monday night, and Gordon was most ungallant - reminding some of those present of the words of one of the chancellor's old flames, Princess Margarita of Romania: \"I never stopped loving him, but one day it didn't seem right any more. It was politics, politics, politics, and I needed nurturing.\"</p> <p>\u0095And now we unveil a new Diary service: \"The Young Meteors: Labour's Leaders of Tomorrow\", where we highlight the candidates lobbying to get safe seats at the next election. Today's Young Meteor is Jon Cruddas, on the short list for Dagenham. As an employee of the No 10 policy unit, Jon's attraction is his unrestrained loyalty to Mr Tony (which, after all, is what the party so desperately needs). Jon is also not afraid of getting into a fight: party workers fondly recall the fight he got into with the revolving door of a Brighton hotel at the Labour conference in 1989 - and the door lost!</p> <p>\u0095Anyone free in Leatherhead on July 2 might like to hear a speaker at the Pioneer People evangelical church: \"Jonathan Aitken's career crashed amidst headlines. Has he really turned to Christ?\" Hmmm.

      "bodyText": "\u0095It's a rare thing that the Diary receives press statements from the Royal Ulster Constabulary, let alone reprints one. But here, in an historic first, is the full text: \"Following inaccurate media coverage of an incident in which an RUC drugs dog is alleged to have snapped at the Secretary of State [Peter Mandelson], the dog's handler wishes to make it absolutely clear that the encounter between the secretary of state and Sky, the labrador, was completely friendly.\" Absolutely. Readers may recall that the Diary yesterday quoted RUC Inspector Tom Crawford, an eyewitness to the incident when O'Mandy tried to stroke the black labrador bitch: \"She can be a wee bit cross if you get too close, and I think the secretary of state found that out when she bared her teeth at him.\" But no - according to the RUC: \"The meeting between the secretary of state and Sky was amicable and the dog handler and the secretary of state had an enjoyable conversation about their mutual interest in labrador dogs.\" Anxious to maintain his dog-friendly image as proud owner of Bobby, the lovable golden retriever, O'Mandy also issued his own rebuttal (although he seems confused about Sky's sex). \"At no point did he snarl, growl or bare his teeth,\" O'Mandy said. \"I and his handler then had a perfectly amicable conversation.\" There are some things you couldn't make up, even if your brain was erased with mind rubbers. \u0095Our plans to rescue the England football team (by getting has-been Alan Shearer interred in a donkey sanctuary) having fallen down, we turn to the Diary Vicar, the Rev Steve Chalke. My colleague Esther Galan asks Steve if he can suggest suitable prayers, and he turns to the Old Testament (Isaiah, 35: 3,4). \"Strengthen the feeble hands. Steady the knees that give way.\" Amen. And with Shearer's injuries in mind, Steve suggests appealing to St Roch, the patron saint of knee problems. But since St Roch was French, English prayers are better directed to St Giles, patron saint of cripples. \u0095Mystery surrounds poor Sarah Macaulay, \"companion\" of Gordon Brown. Sarah appeared quite unhappy at Nick Brown's 50th birthday party at the Marquis of Granby pub on Monday night, and Gordon was most ungallant - reminding some of those present of the words of one of the chancellor's old flames, Princess Margarita of Romania: \"I never stopped loving him, but one day it didn't seem right any more. It was politics, politics, politics, and I needed nurturing.\" \u0095And now we unveil a new Diary service: \"The Young Meteors: Labour's Leaders of Tomorrow\", where we highlight the candidates lobbying to get safe seats at the next election. Today's Young Meteor is Jon Cruddas, on the short list for Dagenham. As an employee of the No 10 policy unit, Jon's attraction is his unrestrained loyalty to Mr Tony (which, after all, is what the party so desperately needs). Jon is also not afraid of getting into a fight: party workers fondly recall the fight he got into with the revolving door of a Brighton hotel at the Labour conference in 1989 - and the door lost! \u0095Anyone free in Leatherhead on July 2 might like to hear a speaker at the Pioneer People evangelical church: \"Jonathan Aitken's career crashed amidst headlines. Has he really turned to Christ?\" Hmmm. We'd all like to know. \u0095Alastair Campbell's decision to keep a lower profile is a great disappointment to all his fans, who are counting the days until he starts his new job as editor of the Mirror after the election. But what of his deputy, now thrust into the limelight, Godric Smith? Anyone with any background on Godric should get in touch. All we know so far is that he's currently 23rd in the lobby's Euro 2000 football pool, just above Fatty Riddell of the Times. The Guardian Diary is in second place. Ha!",

      "body": "<p>There is a new walk on the streets of Tokyo these days. It is too slow to be a stroll and too purposeful to be a wander. In crowds, it often results in the odd stumble, bump and mumbled apology. But it is no drunken stagger either. The legs know where they have to go, but the eyes are too preoccupied to chart a clear course. </p> <p>Suddenly it is cool not to look where you are going in Japan. Why? Because you are engrossed in the latest way to surf the \"wireless web\" - a mobile phone and internet service called i-mode. </p> <p>I-mode (the \"i\" is for information) is the first system to put cyberspace in subscribers' pockets 24 hours a day with cheap and continuous access to a range of information services. Technically sophisticated, but simple to use, it is tipped as the next big thing to come out of the land of the Walkman, the Game Boy and the PlayStation. </p> <p>What's the big deal? Britons can already use their cell phones to get online and exchange email messages using the wireless application protocol (Wap) system. Like i-mode, Wap phones do not access the internet as we know it - rather a cut down version designed to work on small screens. </p> <p>But, while Wap and i-mode are rivals, their contest is in danger of turning into a mismatch between a weedy infant and a bodybuilding giant. In terms of cost, popularity, ease of use and commercial success, Wap is being whipped. It may have been adopted last summer as the European standard, but it has been slow to take off, whereas i-mode is here, now and changing millions of lives </p> <p>Since its launch in February 1999, the system has transformed Japan from an online laggard into one of the fastest growing online markets in the world. With 7 million subscribers, i-mode is the country's most popular online portal. At current rates of growth it will make Japan the first country in the world where mobiles are more popular than PCs as a way of getting into cyberspace, and 600,000 new customers signing up every month have put i-mode on course to overtake America Online (AOL) as the planet's leading online portal by the middle of 2002. The service is so popular that its operator, NTT DoCoMo, had to halt sales and advertising temporarily last month because demand kept crashing the system. </p> <p>Meanwhile investors have made DoCoMo the hottest company in Japan. Last year, it overtook the motor manufacturer Toyota to become the country's most valuable corporation. </p> <p>In Tokyo's trendy Shibuya district, the system is changing the way people look, sound and spend their time. </p> <p>For Yoko Uenishi, a 17-year-old high school girl, a stylish i-mode phone completes a look that includes bleached grey hair, white eyeshadow and precariously high-platformed sandals. </p> <p>\"I bought it because it looked cool and all my friends had one,\" she says. \"But now I use it all the time, especially when I want to kill time on the train.\" </p> <p>Her phone - a tiny, ultra-light, metallic pink device that flips open like a Star Trek communicator - is decorated with a designer strap and stickers of cartoon characters. To personalise it even further, she has downloaded a Hello Kitty animation for the 3cm by 5cm screen inside and a pop song melody that plays when she has a call or a new email. Each day, she picks a new image and tune, for which 100 yen (60p) is added to her monthly phone bill. </p> <p>Like most teens, Yoko mainly uses i-mode for email. She reckons she sends and receives about 15 messages a day - which means clicking away at tiny phone pad buttons until her fingers ache. But she also checks her horoscope each morning, books concert tickets and follows the latest chart news - which, naturally, includes a new top 10 of downloaded melodies. </p> <p>But i-mode is not just child's play. Through more than 13,000 sites, subscribers can book airline tickets, trade stocks or find a lover. Date clubs are said to be particularly popular among would-be adulterers because i-mode offers more anonymity than a phone and a less risk of being discovered than a PC. One site provides information about the nearest available love hotel. </p> <p>Keiji Matsuo, a broker at one of Japan's biggest securities houses, is a recent convert, but finds that the service already fills up a large part of his day. Each morning, he gets a wake-up call from i-mode, then uses it to check what happened on the New York stock market while he was asleep. The latest analysts' reports are emailed to him when he is out of the office and he clicks onto the net to show clients the latest share prices. Last thing at night, he checks the London markets before he goes to bed. </p> <p>\"It's fun, it's useful, it's lighter than a laptop and quieter than a mobile phone,\" he enthuses. \"Best of all it is cheap so my wife doesn't get angry.\" He spends less than \u00a35 a month on i-mode, including the basic \u00a32 fee. </p> <p>It may not sound much, but analysts say i-mode is creating a revolutionary new pattern of consumption. The buzz word is micro-niches - tiny purchases that can be made while walking along the street or waiting for a train. Until now, these have been impossible because of the costs of distribution and billing, but with i-mode the marketplace is in your pocket and the cash register is your monthly phone bill. </p> <p>Because i-mode offers continuous access to the internet, there is no need to dial up and wait for a response and most sites can also be accessed with just a few button clicks rather than typing out web addresses. </p> <p>Yet the service is far cheaper than using a personal computer and landline because charges are based not on time, but on the volume of data downloaded. Receiving five short emails costs about 10 yen (6p), while the charge for checking a train timetable or the weather is unlikely to be more than 10p. You do not need a credit card - these transactions are automatically put on your phone bill. </p> <p>This allows almost unconscious consumption. It is as though DoCoMo and partners have found a way to package plankton and sell it to whales. </p> <p>The toy maker Bandai, for example, earns about \u00a3600,000 a month from a website that simply provides a different picture each day for i-mode users to download onto their screens. More than a million people pay 60p a month for this service. </p> <p>DoCoMo president, Keiji Tochikawa, says simplicity is the key: \"We hope customers will use our next generation of mobile phones to exchange information as naturally as they breathe air.\" </p> <p>These microniches are already generating huge revenue. According to the Nomura Research Institute, i-mode's 7 million subscribers spend an average of 1,600 yen (\u00a310.60) per month on content. This means big bucks for DoCoMo, which gets 9% of the fee for every cartoon character, melody or news service that is downloaded. </p> <p>On top of this, DoCoMo rakes in monthly subscription fees of 300 yen per person and 0.3 yen (a fifth of a penny) for each 128-bit package of data received or transmitted. </p> <p>For the first full year that i-mode was in operation, DoCoMo racked up record profits of 252.1bn yen (\u00a31.6bn), a jump of 23% from the previous 12 months. Much more is to come, according to fore casts that the wireless market will grow fivefold by 2003. </p> <p>\"This is just the beginning,\" said Kaji Nishigaki, president of NEC, which makes handsets. \"Within three years everyone will be on i-mode.\" </p> <p>Currently the system is a prototype available only in Japan, but DoCoMo has plans to make it smoother, faster and more widely accepted. </p> <p>From next spring, it will the first company in the world to introduce a third generation mobile communication system that it says will allow data transmission at 15 times the existing speed of 9.6 kilobits per second. By 2003, the company hopes to raise the pace further to a blistering two megabits per second, swift enough for webcasts, interactive games and video conferencing. </p> <p>This is frightening news for European telecommunication companies, which are at least a year behind. </p> <p>Until recently, it was widely believed that i-mode would be difficult to export because of technical standards, security concerns and cultural differences. </p> <p> However DoCoMo has begun to move aggressively into overseas markets. Last year, it formed partnerships with global giants Microsoft and Sun Microsystems. Last month it bought a bridgehead in Europe with a \u20ac 5bn stake in KPN, a Dutch mobile phone company. It has also paid $5bn for 20% of Voice System, the US cellphone firm. </p> <p>Further takeovers and tie-ups are expected as DoCoMo becomes evangelical about its system. It will be hard to resist. As the world's most valuable telecommunications company, DoCoMo has an almost bottomless war chest as well as the backing of its politically powerful former parent company, NTT. </p> <p>Unless Wap gets moving, European consumers could be the next ones doing the i-mode walk. </p> <p> In Japan, there has been no contest between i-mode and Wap. The EZ system (based on Wap) is faster and technically superior, but i-mode is cheaper and has greater marketing clout. Who says the best man wins? Remember VHS vs Betamax. </p> <p> <strong> i-mode </strong><br> <strong> Company: </strong> NTT DoCoMo <br> <strong> Speed: </strong> 9.6 kbps <br> <strong> Subscribers:</strong> About 7 million <br> <strong> Standard:</strong> cHTML <br> <strong> Sites:</strong> 13,000 <br> <strong> Outline:</strong> The cheapest and most popular way onto the wireless web.

Able to tap into 30 million mobile phone customer base of DoCoMo. </p> <p> <strong> EZaccess and EZ web</strong><br> <strong> Companies: </strong> IDO and Tu-Ka <br> <strong> Speed:</strong> Up to 64 kbps <br> <strong> Combined subscribers: </strong> Less than 2 million <br> <strong> Standard:</strong> HDML (handheld device markup language) <br> <strong> Site numbers: </strong> Less than 500 <br> <strong> Outline: </strong> Second most popular system, but far less content because the relative difficulty of HDML has deterred many site designers. </p> <p> <strong> J-Skyweb</strong> <br> <strong> Company</strong> : J-Phone <br> <strong> Estimated subscribers:</strong> Less than 2 million <br> <strong> Code:</strong> MML (mobile markup language). Very similar to cHTML <br> <strong> Speed: </strong> 9.6 kbps <br> <strong> Site numbers:</strong> Less than 500. <br> <strong> Outline:</strong> Clearest colour images. In third place at present, however it is seen as the main rival for i-mode because its programming code is so similar and because it also offers continuous access.</p>",

On top of this, DoCoMo rakes in monthly subscription fees of 300 yen per person and 0.3 yen (a fifth of a penny) for each 128-bit package of data received or transmitted. For the first full year that i-mode was in operation, DoCoMo racked up record profits of 252.1bn yen (\u00a31.6bn), a jump of 23% from the previous 12 months. Much more is to come, according to fore casts that the wireless market will grow fivefold by 2003. \"This is just the beginning,\" said Kaji Nishigaki, president of NEC, which makes handsets. \"Within three years everyone will be on i-mode.\" Currently the system is a prototype available only in Japan, but DoCoMo has plans to make it smoother, faster and more widely accepted. From next spring, it will the first company in the world to introduce a third generation mobile communication system that it says will allow data transmission at 15 times the existing speed of 9.6 kilobits per second. By 2003, the company hopes to raise the pace further to a blistering two megabits per second, swift enough for webcasts, interactive games and video conferencing. This is frightening news for European telecommunication companies, which are at least a year behind. Until recently, it was widely believed that i-mode would be difficult to export because of technical standards, security concerns and cultural differences. However DoCoMo has begun to move aggressively into overseas markets. Last year, it formed partnerships with global giants Microsoft and Sun Microsystems. Last month it bought a bridgehead in Europe with a \u20ac 5bn stake in KPN, a Dutch mobile phone company. It has also paid $5bn for 20% of Voice System, the US cellphone firm. Further takeovers and tie-ups are expected as DoCoMo becomes evangelical about its system. It will be hard to resist. As the world's most valuable telecommunications company, DoCoMo has an almost bottomless war chest as well as the backing of its politically powerful former parent company, NTT. Unless Wap gets moving, European consumers could be the next ones doing the i-mode walk. In Japan, there has been no contest between i-mode and Wap. The EZ system (based on Wap) is faster and technically superior, but i-mode is cheaper and has greater marketing clout. Who says the best man wins? Remember VHS vs Betamax. i-mode Company: NTT DoCoMo Speed: 9.6 kbps Subscribers: About 7 million Standard: cHTML Sites: 13,000 Outline: The cheapest and most popular way onto the wireless web. Uses packet switching system to offer continuous connection. Able to tap into 30 million mobile phone customer base of DoCoMo. EZaccess and EZ web Companies: IDO and Tu-Ka Speed: Up to 64 kbps Combined subscribers: Less than 2 million Standard: HDML (handheld device markup language) Site numbers: Less than 500 Outline: Second most popular system, but far less content because the relative difficulty of HDML has deterred many site designers. J-Skyweb Company : J-Phone Estimated subscribers: Less than 2 million Code: MML (mobile markup language). Very similar to cHTML Speed: 9.6 kbps Site numbers: Less than 500. Outline: Clearest colour images. In third place at present, however it is seen as the main rival for i-mode because its programming code is so similar and because it also offers continuous access.",

As a young and inexperienced defence minister in the 1967 war, he presided over the loss of the Golan Heights. In 1970 he sent tanks into Jordan to help the Palestinians against King Hussein, but had to beat a humiliating retreat when Israel threatened to intervene. In 1973 he secretly planned the October war with Egypt's Anwar al-Sadat, but Israel turned the tables on them both, and by defeating Egypt took it out of the Arab military equation.</p> <p>When the hardline Menachem Begin came to power in Israel in 1977, Assad faced a militant Likud determined to create a \"greater Israel\". In 1982 Israel invaded Lebanon. Rallying his allies, Assad fought back. Israel's adventure turned into a debacle. From Syria's point of view, it was Assad's finest hour.</p> <p>Assad had an ally of sorts in the Soviet Union. But the Soviets were reluctant to give their Arab allies the means to recover their lost territories by force, still less to defeat Israel in all-out war. So Assad never entered fully into the Soviet orbit. Once the Soviet empire faltered, he was quick to grasp that a major prop of his world was gone. By 1987 he was busy making overtures to Washington.</p> <p>The destruction of Iraq in the Gulf war further weakened Syria's strategic position. Assad recognised that Iraq's aggression was a serious threat to Syria's interests. So Assad joined the American-led coalition and sent troops to help defend Saudi Arabia. But he did not welcome the war. As an Arab patriot, he deplored the destruction of Iraq, the depletion of Arab financial assets, the ever-greater influence of the United States, and the loss of Arab independence. Israel's position became unassailable.</p> <p>Such was the impetus for the new phase of Middle East peace-making launched in October 1991. Assad had long argued that peace with Israel was not worth having unless it was comprehensive, involving an Israeli retreat on all fronts. He opposed separate deals, which he felt divided the Arab camp. It was with great hesitation that he fell in with the formula of separate tracks, which was to Israel's advantage. The September 1993 Israeli accord with Yasser Arafat's PLO, which put an end to the intifada in the occupied territories without giving the Palestinians any substantial gains, was another setback.

As a result, Syria's peace negotiations with Israel made slow progress. He offered Israel \"full peace for full withdrawal\", making clear that a normalisation of relations could take place only once Israel had committed itself to a full withdrawal from the Golan and southern Lebanon.</p> <p>Assad displayed two principal traits.

It was in this context alone that the dispute arose and it had nothing to do with payment to influence the outcome of any match. The dispute was amicably resolved.\" </p> <p>Bacher was instrumental in establishing the commission of inquiry and testified before it on Monday, alleging that corruption was widespread in international cricket. He implicated several top players and an umpire.</p>",

Today's proceedings will be preceded by a local television station's petition to Judge Edwin King to be allowed to televise proceedings live; it is likely to be granted. Cronje, apparently, is so far lost in the depths of despair and sorrow he would not notice if there were television cameras or not. According to one member of his legal team he has not eaten for days and is in poor health. Defence is not really a viable option for Cronje and his legal team but there are mitigating factors of such emotional force that South Africans are likely to transfer their bitterness from their former favourite son to the men who trapped him and led him astray. And that is all Cronje now wants, having accepted, according to his legal advisers, that \"his playing days are over\". Ali Bacher, the head of the United Cricket Board of South Africa, denied allegations yesterday that he fixed a match during a rebel tour by a West Indies side in 1983. In a statement submitted to the match-fixing inquiry, the Johannesburg lawyer Peter Soller accused Bacher of offering to pay West Indies extra if they \"agreed to blow the match\". Soller and Bacher had been asked to help resolve a dispute when the rebel side refused to go back on to the playing field after lunch because they were not paid enough. \"This statement is false and defamatory and I regard it as the gravest possible imputation against my character,\" Bacher said. \"There is absolutely no substance in this allegation whatsoever. \"At one point the West Indies XI threatened that they would not play a particular match should they not receive the promised bonus. It was in this context alone that the dispute arose and it had nothing to do with payment to influence the outcome of any match. The dispute was amicably resolved.\" Bacher was instrumental in establishing the commission of inquiry and testified before it on Monday, alleging that corruption was widespread in international cricket. He implicated several top players and an umpire.",

The decision is still being resisted by angry locals and, judging by events at May's Bounty yesterday, they are right to do so. </p> <p>When bad light ended play at 5.30, Hampshire's struggling batting line-up was approaching its highest score of the season with significant power to add. The county should play here more not less. </p> <p>Those opposed to the decision to abandon Basingstoke claim they first heard the news on television. A petition followed. Then came a protest meeting. Hampshire's chairman Brian Ford and the club's chief executive Tony Baker heard their arguments but the decision to pull the plug on the ground that first staged a championship match in 1906, and which gave the young John Arlott his first view of cricket, was not reversed. </p> <p>Now a campaign has started to persuade the club they are making a mistake. \"We are fairly upset about it but we are doing all we can to get it back,\" said Tony Gibson, vice-chairman of the Basingstoke &amp; North Hampshire Cricket Club, whose ground it is. </p> <p>The strategy involves raising funds from the local council and local businesses and guaranteeing Hampshire a fee to play here. Sussex's match at Horsham this season came about through a similar arrangement. A figure in the region of \u00a312,000 has been mooted. </p> <p>\"Our grounds are part of the fabric of county cricket. They make it unique,\" said Richard Whitehead, spokesman for the campaign. \"But we are not trying to preserve a white elephant. Hampshire are turning their back on their biggest attendance of the season.\" </p> <p>Hampshire, though, will not be swayed.

      "bodyText": "During the winter Hampshire's committee ruled that this would be Basingstoke's last championship match. The decision is still being resisted by angry locals and, judging by events at May's Bounty yesterday, they are right to do so. When bad light ended play at 5.30, Hampshire's struggling batting line-up was approaching its highest score of the season with significant power to add. The county should play here more not less. Those opposed to the decision to abandon Basingstoke claim they first heard the news on television. A petition followed. Then came a protest meeting. Hampshire's chairman Brian Ford and the club's chief executive Tony Baker heard their arguments but the decision to pull the plug on the ground that first staged a championship match in 1906, and which gave the young John Arlott his first view of cricket, was not reversed. Now a campaign has started to persuade the club they are making a mistake. \"We are fairly upset about it but we are doing all we can to get it back,\" said Tony Gibson, vice-chairman of the Basingstoke &amp; North Hampshire Cricket Club, whose ground it is. The strategy involves raising funds from the local council and local businesses and guaranteeing Hampshire a fee to play here. Sussex's match at Horsham this season came about through a similar arrangement. A figure in the region of \u00a312,000 has been mooted. \"Our grounds are part of the fabric of county cricket. They make it unique,\" said Richard Whitehead, spokesman for the campaign. \"But we are not trying to preserve a white elephant. Hampshire are turning their back on their biggest attendance of the season.\" Hampshire, though, will not be swayed. Around \u00a310m has been raised to move the county's headquarters from Northlands Road to the Rose Bowl in the east of Southampton at the end of the season. That is taking precedence. \"We've made a decision,\" said Baker. \"We're committed to play at the Rose Bowl to justify our investment. We need to concentrate all our efforts on one ground.\" If it is to be Basingstoke's last game, then at least there was something decent to watch. Giles White hit three fours in the first over of the morning, bowled by Simon Brown, and put on 50 for the first wicket inside 10 overs with the 20-year-old debutant Andrew Sexton. Steve Harmison ended the stand at 62, having White smartly taken at second slip by Paul Collingwood. Harmison, released from his duties with England, was Durham's biggest threat.

But, when he pushed forward to Melvyn Betts, the umpire Tony Clarkson had his finger up for lbw almost before the bowler had cleared his throat. The captain Robin Smith gave Will Kendall a 19-over start but had passed his score within a further nine. The occasional false stroke from Smith was punctuated by powerful thumps through the offside. He did not look like a man who is averaging only 17 this season. The biggest surprise came when Collingwood, Durham's fifth seamer, dismissed both in quick succession after a partnership of 67.

As before, a win earns 12 points , a tie 6 , a normal draw 4 (see later *) and a defeat none, plus any bonus points accrued for batting and bowling in each first innings. Bonus points are now reckoned on the score in the first 130 overs, not 120 overs as in recent seasons. Batting: now 5 pts can be earned (4 last year) 200 -249 runs (1pt); 250-299 (2); 300-349 (3); 350-399 (4); 400 or over (5) NATIONAL LEAGUE First Division Worcestershire v Gloucestershire Worcester (floodflit match) WORCESTERSHIRE P R Pollard lbw b Averis 41 E J Wilson c Russell b Smith 10 V S Solanki c Russell b Smith 6 D A Leatherdale c Russell b Snape 18 R C Driver b Harvey 19 *S J Rhodes c and b Harvey 12 S R Lampitt c Alleyne b Harvey 5 R K Illingworth c Alleyne b Averis Kabir Ali run out G D McGrath st Russell b Harvey A Sheriyar not out 1 Extras (b2, lb10, w17) 29 Total (44.4 overs) 141 Fall: 39, 46, 87, 101, 129, 135, 136, 139, 140 Bowling: Harvey 8.4-3-23-4; Smith 9-0-22-2; Averis 9-0-26-2; Alleyne 9-0-26-0; Cawdron 4-0-13-0; Snape 5-1-19-1.
