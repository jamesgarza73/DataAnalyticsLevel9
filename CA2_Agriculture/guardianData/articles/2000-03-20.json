      "body": "<p>Celtic, by the use of perspiration rather than imagination, won the League Cup yesterday by comfortably seeing off the challenge of Aberdeen as every bit of statistical evidence said they would. </p> <p>In what may still end up as an unsatisfactory season, they at least have a trophy to show off. \"I was getting fed up looking at team groups and all there was in front of the players in the picture were a couple of balls and the physio's bag,\" said one fan. </p> <p>The goals from Vidar Riseth and Tommy Johnson were nicely timed and the manager Kenny Dalglish took no risks after that as Celtic played the rest of the game cautiously. The departed John Barnes, it should be added in fairness, had a hand in this small triumph for a club that has been used to slender pickings recently. </p> <p>There was little of the swagger that had been seen when the Bhoys planted 18 goals past Aberdeen in three league matches this season, but the business still had to be done. The Dons may have shaken off the tag of Europe's worst first division team but they are hardly the finished article and Jonathan Gould was completely untroubled in the Celtic goal. </p> <p>Dalglish was in his taciturn mode at the end. \"I've only won a couple of matches. John Barnes did the rest and the players worked really hard,\" he said. \"It will allow our supporters to go to work in a good mood in the morning.\" </p> <p>Celtic were largely in control throughout with Tom Boyd marshalling the defence and Morten Wieghorst and Lubomir Moravcik setting out their midfield stalls.

      "bodyText": "Celtic, by the use of perspiration rather than imagination, won the League Cup yesterday by comfortably seeing off the challenge of Aberdeen as every bit of statistical evidence said they would. In what may still end up as an unsatisfactory season, they at least have a trophy to show off. \"I was getting fed up looking at team groups and all there was in front of the players in the picture were a couple of balls and the physio's bag,\" said one fan. The goals from Vidar Riseth and Tommy Johnson were nicely timed and the manager Kenny Dalglish took no risks after that as Celtic played the rest of the game cautiously. The departed John Barnes, it should be added in fairness, had a hand in this small triumph for a club that has been used to slender pickings recently. There was little of the swagger that had been seen when the Bhoys planted 18 goals past Aberdeen in three league matches this season, but the business still had to be done. The Dons may have shaken off the tag of Europe's worst first division team but they are hardly the finished article and Jonathan Gould was completely untroubled in the Celtic goal. Dalglish was in his taciturn mode at the end. \"I've only won a couple of matches. John Barnes did the rest and the players worked really hard,\" he said. \"It will allow our supporters to go to work in a good mood in the morning.\" Celtic were largely in control throughout with Tom Boyd marshalling the defence and Morten Wieghorst and Lubomir Moravcik setting out their midfield stalls. Only up front, where Mark Viduka was strangely subdued, could any weakness be found. But their lead in the 15th minute rather confounded the bright start Aberdeen had made to the match. The goal was another small indication of the defensive frailties that have blighted the Dons since the start of the season. Moravcik, probing away on the left, held up the ball just long enough for Wieghorst to make his forward run and he delivered the ball around Mark Perry's feet. The Dane found Riseth, of all people, standing alone on the six-yard line and, after a rather inelegant swing, the ball ended up in the back of the net. Aberdeen continued to prove through the first half that they had brought some vibrancy to the occasion - Hicham Zerouali's wasted volley from an Arild Stavrum cross showing a willingness to attack opponents still struggling to string passes together. But the Dons could do only so much and no more. Their chances collapsed in an eight-minute period after the interval in which one of their players was carried off, another sent off, and in which they conceded a second goal. The Moroccan Zerouali looked in considerable pain after an awkward but scarcely malevolent challenge on Jackie McNamara. Five minutes later, Celtic had the game wrapped up when McNamara, Moravcik and Viduka all combined down the middle to allow Johnson to draw Jim Leighton and beat him with a cross shot. As Celtic went for the jugular, Thomas Solberg's desperate and illegal tackle on Stilian Petrov saw him dismissed for a second bookable offence. Moravcik later saw his chip cannon back off the bar, but it mattered not. Aberdeen supporters were left only to contemplate a long and largely silent journey home.",

Beckham's hair is now styled after the US marines and just past the half-hour he dipped a free-kick inside the near post helped by a Leicester wall built after the style of Jericho. Seven minutes from the end Matt Elliott failed to intercept a low centre from Ryan Giggs and Yorke completed a victory which had long looked inevitable.",

The Londoners fell behind to lowly Blackpool when Wayne Gill opened the scoring, but Neil Harris's penalty just before half-time earned the Lions a point. \u0095 Wigan emerged victorious from their derby against Bury thanks to Andy Liddell's goal with 15 minutes to go at the JJB Stadium.",

      "body": "<p>Manchester City, never a club to take more than one step forward without the likelihood of a major pratfall, found themselves back in second place in the table yesterday, but more by default than any grand surge of inspiration. </p> <p>This was their sixth match without a win, which hardly warranted the huge cheer that went up when the home supporters discovered that Ipswich Town had lost at home to Norwich City. With Barnsley, Birmingham City and Huddersfield Town all crowding in behind, both Manchester City and Ipswich fans face an anxious time up to and including Easter. </p> <p>Charlton, by some way the best team in the division this season, will surely go up as champions, and they had the more clearcut chances to have won yesterday, although with 20 minutes left their manager Alan Curbishley would have settled for the point. </p> <p>But with a crowd of more than 32,000 again at Maine Road, and with the match being shown live on Sky, neither team was in a mood for expediency. \"Both sides wanted to win, whereas in recent times the teams coming here have put everybody behind the ball,\" said City's manager Joe Royle, who believes his side have come out of a lull and now need \"a kiss from Lady Luck\". </p> <p>Both goals certainly enjoyed a huge slice of fortune. Dean Kiely had made a brilliant save from a Jamie Pollock header before Charlton believed they had taken the lead when Andy Hunt headed in Shaun Newton's cross, only for John Robinson to be adjudged offside. </p> <p>With Charlton still cursing, City pounced when Shaun Goater swung a boot at Ian Bishop's parabolic through-ball, arrived a touch early and shinned a lob beyond Kiely, who was prepared for something faster and lower. </p> <p>It was imperative that City did not concede a goal before half-time, thereby increasing the certainty that they would; such are the laws of physics peculiar to Maine Road. </p> <p>Robinson's shot was going to some remote area, harmless to Nick Weaver, when it struck Newton somewhere in the region of his shoulder to take an immense diversion which left the City goalkeeper, as one music hall comedian used to say, \"stood standing\". </p> <p>Charlton, whose run of 12 consecutive First Division victories ended against the bottom side Swindon Town in their previous match, looked rather more vulnerable at the beginning of the second half. </p> <p>Both Jim Whitley and Robert Taylor, the latter returning after injury, should have scored.

      "bodyText": "Manchester City, never a club to take more than one step forward without the likelihood of a major pratfall, found themselves back in second place in the table yesterday, but more by default than any grand surge of inspiration. This was their sixth match without a win, which hardly warranted the huge cheer that went up when the home supporters discovered that Ipswich Town had lost at home to Norwich City. With Barnsley, Birmingham City and Huddersfield Town all crowding in behind, both Manchester City and Ipswich fans face an anxious time up to and including Easter. Charlton, by some way the best team in the division this season, will surely go up as champions, and they had the more clearcut chances to have won yesterday, although with 20 minutes left their manager Alan Curbishley would have settled for the point. But with a crowd of more than 32,000 again at Maine Road, and with the match being shown live on Sky, neither team was in a mood for expediency. \"Both sides wanted to win, whereas in recent times the teams coming here have put everybody behind the ball,\" said City's manager Joe Royle, who believes his side have come out of a lull and now need \"a kiss from Lady Luck\". Both goals certainly enjoyed a huge slice of fortune. Dean Kiely had made a brilliant save from a Jamie Pollock header before Charlton believed they had taken the lead when Andy Hunt headed in Shaun Newton's cross, only for John Robinson to be adjudged offside. With Charlton still cursing, City pounced when Shaun Goater swung a boot at Ian Bishop's parabolic through-ball, arrived a touch early and shinned a lob beyond Kiely, who was prepared for something faster and lower. It was imperative that City did not concede a goal before half-time, thereby increasing the certainty that they would; such are the laws of physics peculiar to Maine Road. Robinson's shot was going to some remote area, harmless to Nick Weaver, when it struck Newton somewhere in the region of his shoulder to take an immense diversion which left the City goalkeeper, as one music hall comedian used to say, \"stood standing\". Charlton, whose run of 12 consecutive First Division victories ended against the bottom side Swindon Town in their previous match, looked rather more vulnerable at the beginning of the second half. Both Jim Whitley and Robert Taylor, the latter returning after injury, should have scored. Whitley made the wrong decision to try one extra pass to Goater, while Taylor's lack of match sharpness saw him scuff a shot with the goal gaping. Thereafter it was Charlton, who have a 13-point lead over City, who created the better openings. Newton tried a shot when the better option was a pass to Mathias Svensson, and then Martin Pringle, on for Svensson, wasted two more openings. There was no doubting the raw excitement of chances made and chances squandered, and both managers were pleased with their respective sides' efforts. But there really was not much in the way of quality - certainly not the sort of quality that would sustain either team for longer than one season in the Premiership.",

So while their brainier classmates appearing on University Challenge rote-learn the finer points of molecular biology, Dicing with Debt contestants need only brush up on the traditional student interests of drinking, daytime television and casual sex. </p> <p>A Channel 4 spokeswoman said: \"Only legitimate student loans will be paid off and the students have to give the precise amount of their debts, down to the nearest pound.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "The ultimate university challenge, as any impoverished student knows, is no longer a starter for 10 from Jeremy Paxman but the ability to pay off student loans. With this in mind, a new Channel 4 quiz show called Dicing with Debt plans to offer hard-up undergraduates the opportunity to battle their way out of the red and into the black, with a star prize of thousands of pounds to write off the winner's debts. It may not offer the financial potential of Who Wants to be a Millionaire? or the intellectual cachet of University Challenge, but financially stricken students are expected to be queueing up to wipe out three years of debt in half an hour. The show, hosted by the comedian Paul Tonkinson, is scheduled for the autumn and will be produced by Hat Trick, the television production company behind numerous award-winning shows, including Have I Got News For You. Other prizes, such as the contestant's height in pizza and a year's subscription to the Radio Times - and other items of use to the average undergraduate - will be offered. But it is the star prize that most contestants will be hoping to win, with the average student expected to leave university with debts of \u00a312,000 thanks to rising tuition fees, inadequate grants and soaring living expenses. Dicing with Debt will see six students fight to clear their debts by rolling the dice and answering questions about popular culture. So while their brainier classmates appearing on University Challenge rote-learn the finer points of molecular biology, Dicing with Debt contestants need only brush up on the traditional student interests of drinking, daytime television and casual sex. A Channel 4 spokeswoman said: \"Only legitimate student loans will be paid off and the students have to give the precise amount of their debts, down to the nearest pound.\"",

      "bodyText": "Every key stage of the criminal justice system is riddled with racism, leaving black people with a greater prospect of being arrested and jailed than whites, according to a study by a penal reform group. British Afro-Caribbean people are seven times more likely to be in jail despite being no more likely to commit crimes, says the Howard League. Its analysis of official figures throughout the criminal justice system, from arrest to incarceration, is due to be published on Wednesday. The report suggests that the unequal treatment suffered by black people at the hands of the police, identified by the Macpherson report, is practised by all parts of the criminal justice system. The study shows the discrimination occurs despite people in ethnic minorities being in greatest need of protection by the criminal justice system as they are more likely to be victims of crime. Data from the British Crime Survey shows that Pakistanis and Bangladeshis are worst affected. Furthermore, no evidence exists to suggest the disparities are due to greater lawlessness by Afro-Caribbeans. An official study of 18- to 24-year-olds who had admitted crimes found 43% of Afro-Caribbeans and 44% of whites had confessed to law breaking, compared with 30% of British Indians and 28% of British Pakistanis. Afro-Caribbean people are six times more likely than whites to be stopped and searched by the police and more likely to be arrested. Of 1.3m arrests in 1998-99, 7% were of Afro-Caribbean people, who make up 2% of the population, 4% were of Asian people, who comprise 3% of the nation, with 1% of other ethnic minority groups. But after arrest the same amount of ethnic minority people as whites were charged - 59%. Afro-Caribbean and Asian suspects were more likely than whites to be remanded in custody after being charged - 35% of Afro-Caribbean people and 34% of Asians had bail requests refused, compared with 26% for whites. Some evidence on sentencing suggests it is carried out fairly, while the study says other research has found \"significant discrepancies in the use of imprisonment and the length of sentences\". Afro-Caribbeans are far more likely than any other ethnic group to be imprisoned. In June 1998 the rate of incarceration per 100,000 of the general population was 1,245 for black people, 185 for whites and 168 for Asians. White people, who are 94% of the British population, made up 82% of male prison inmates, Afro-Caribbeans were 12% of those imprisoned, Asians 3%, and other ethnic minorities 3%. The Howard League study noted that ethnic minorities were under-represented in the criminal justice system as employees, in posts such as police and prison officers, lay magistrates and at all senior levels. Frances Crook, director of the Howard League, said: \"The number of black people in our prisons is out of all proportion to the size of the black community, yet there is no evidence to suggest that people from ethnic minority groups commit more crime. \"The reasons for this are complex. It is partly a matter of social deprivation. \"But it is also clear that discrimination operates at every stage in the criminal justice system, from the chances of being arrested to the decision of the court and the length of the sentence. \"These individuals must then endure the culture of racism which still operates in many of our prisons.\"",

Steve Kirk, writer for MiniWorld magazine, which sells to Mini drivers in 92 countries, knows why: \"The car was originally marketed as a woman's choice of transport and it wasn't until the mid 60s, after John Cooper had got hold of it, that people realised it was a small sports car.

Adrian Rushmore, who edits Glass's car guide, sees it as an automotive Queen Mum. \"It's an evergreen that has grown old gracefully, but it trades more on its reputation than any real technical prowess. An aura surrounds it, but despite some updates, it's not much short of a disaster.\"</p> <p>BMW's aim to sell the new model in very small numbers (the global sales estimate is for about 200,000 cars a year) will spell huge demand. Rushmore says it will be just as cherished as its predecessor because the new car is instantly recognisable as a Mini. \"The price, however, will be crucial. The maker initially said it would sell from \u00a311,995 - so it will definitely be perceived as a premium product.\"</p> <p>Perhaps not by chance that leaves the Mini fitting rather neatly into BMW's own car range. As any disgruntled Rover dealer will tell you, with Mercedes and Audi all downsizing to offer premium small cars, the Mini makes sense as the new entry-level BMW. Rushmore agrees: \"But if the car did go directly under BMW's badge, it would take something away. The world market may not think it matters, but in Britain, a BMW Mini would destroy the Mini for good.\"</p> <p>Even if the sales target is modest, everyone agrees that the new car has a tough act to follow. No model has forced its way into popular culture so effectively.

      "body": "<p>When groups of old war correspondents gather in a bar - as they have been known to do - they shed a nostalgic tear for Vietnam, the days when they were heroes, famous and important. </p> <p>In Vietnam, the United States military accepted them, called on all ranks to give them full cooperation and assistance, transported them, fed them on a reimbursable basis, briefed them, armed them when necessary, defended them, drank with them, and treated them like members of the team. Free from any censorship, the war correspondents went where they chose, reported the truth as they saw it and, according to the military establishment, thus lost the United States the war. </p> <p>Robert Elegant, a long-serving Asia expert, wrote later: \"For the first time in modern history the outcome of war was determined not on the battlefield but on the printed page and, above all, on the television screen.\" </p> <p>The military was bitter. War correspondents had been patriotic in the second world war and on side in Korea. What was wrong in Vietnam? \"So you're Malcolm Browne,\" said Admiral Harry D Felt when he met the legendary Associated Press journalist. \"Why the hell don't you get on the team?\" </p> <p>Now fast-forward 25 years to Kosovo in March last year. More correspondents than ever were all set to cover the conflict - an astonishing 2,700 media people accompanied Nato forces when they entered the province at the end of the bombing campaign. </p> <p>Official arrangements for them were awe-inspiring. There was a daily briefing at Nato's headquarters in Brussels, a series of briefings at the Ministry of Defence in London, media meetings at the Pentagon, press conferences at the White House and statement after statement from President Clinton, Prime Minister Blair, and numerous other Allied ministers. Nato generals lined up to be interviewed and armchair strategists jostled for air time. There were even Allied correspondents in the enemy capital, Belgrade, and Serbian journalists attended Nato briefings in Brussels. </p> <p>The revolution in communications technology; the satellite phone - the star of the war; instant TV links from the front to the studio and between correspondents in the field; electronic transmission of still photographs; and - the latest arrival at the front - the internet; all were available to provide the public with an unprecedented overview of the war. The ordinary, literate citizen would be able to know more about the conflict than any war in history. </p> <p>Instead, we drowned in wave after wave of words and images that added up to nothing. \"Kosovo ... turned out to be the most secret campaign in living memory,\" wrote the British war historian Alistair Horne. \"We were given lots of material but no information,\" says Sky war correspondent Jake Lynch. British journalist Peter Dunn wrote that it was \"the first international conflict fought by press officers.\" General Sir Michael Rose, former commander of the UN force in Bosnia, said that at Nato \"rhetoric has taken over from reality\". </p> <p>What had changed between Vietnam and Kosovo? Basically, the military has won its 150-year battle with war correspondents: journalists want to tell the public everything; the military's attitude is: \"Tell them nothing till the war's over, then tell them who won.\" Defeated by the military, governments and spin doctors, war correspondents now face an agonising choice. If they can no longer be heroes, do they want to continue as propagandists and myth makers, subservient to those who wage the wars? </p> <p>The turning point in the battle was the Falklands. The nature of the campaign - a seaborne task force sailing to invade a group of islands 8,000 miles from Britain and 400 miles from the nearest land mass - meant that correspondents could not get to the war unless the Ministry of Defence took them. In return for access to the action the correspondents had to accept the MoD rules. </p> <p>These were crippling. British correspondents only; no impartial neutrals. The British applicants were vetted - no room, for example, for veteran photographer Don McCullin, because his photographs tended to be too realistic. </p> <p>The 17 correspondents eventually accredited had to sign forms agreeing to accept censorship at source by six MoD \"public relations officers\". And they were told that it was their duty to \"help in leading and steadying public opinion in times of national stress or crisis\". The result was that the war was reported exactly how the military wanted it to be. </p> <p>From this success, a theory developed. If you confronted the media groups and told them that, unlike Vietnam, this was a war that they would not be allowed to cover, they would become so desperate and divided that you could do a deal - they would be allowed war coverage but only on the military's terms. </p> <p>This theory was tested in the American invasions of Grenada and Panama, and worked brilliantly in the Gulf war. There the United States and Britain operated a \"pool system\". Only a limited number of journalists would be allowed near the battlefield; they would be escorted by officers who would decide what they would see; and the journalists would have to make their reports available to everyone. </p> <p>Although media organisations complained that this amounted to censorship more dangerous than \"blue-pencil editing\", they ended up accepting it because they had no choice. They also accepted the \"advice\" of their MoD minders on what they could write because, as the Economist put it, \"the truth about the Gulf war ... must await the end of the fighting\". </p> <p>So by the time Kosovo came around, the lies, manipulation, news management, propaganda, spin, distortion, omission, slant and gullibility involved in trying to report the conflict brought war correspondents to the current crisis point in their short history. Their role has never been more insecure. </p> <p>The most shameful event for the media during the Kosovo war was a United States Congressional fact-finding mission to Yugoslavia between April 18 and 21. Congressmen felt they could trust neither the administration nor the media to tell them what was really happening - what an indictment of war correspondents. How did they allow this sorry state of affairs to come about? </p> <p>One difficulty is that the media have little or no memory. War correspondents have short working lives and there is no tradition or means for passing on their knowledge and experience. The military, on the other hand, is an institution and goes on forever. The military learned a lot from Vietnam and these days plans its media strategy with as much attention as its military strategy. </p> <p>The Pentagon and the MoD have manuals, updated after every war, which serve to guide the way they will manage the media - as does every other major military power. What media organisation has anything similar? </p> <p>All these military manuals follow basic principles - appear open, transparent and eager to help; never go in for summary repression or direct control; nullify rather than conceal undesirable news; control emphasis rather than facts; balance bad news with good; and lie directly only when certain that the lie will not be found out during the course of the war. </p> <p>We are learning only now what lies we were told and what secrets were kept from us during the war in Kosovo. We were not told that the CIA helped train the Kosovo Liberation Army before the bombing began. We were not told that the KLA realised its attacks on Serb policemen would bring retaliation on ethnic Albanian civilians but it went ahead anyway because it hoped that Serbian atrocities would bring in the west - as they did. </p> <p>We did not realise at the time that Nato was lying when it said it did not deliberately attack civilian targets. It was not until June that Nato's commander, General Wesley Clark, admitted to the BBC's Mark Urban that Nato planes were targeting \"phase 3\" [civilian] targets. </p> <p>We believed Nato when it said that after the war it would disarm and disband the KLA. But Jonathan Dimbleby wrote in January that the KLA remained in control of the streets, Nato had delivered Kosovo from one catastrophe straight into another and western leaders had stayed shockingly silent about outrages taking place there. \"So much for moral crusades,\" said Dimbleby. </p> <p>We believed Nato when it said it was systematically destroying the Serbian army in Kosovo, only to learn after the war that this was simply not so. We believed the figures the State Department and Pentagon released for the number of ethnic Albanians murdered by Serbs, only to see them come tumbling down - 500,000, then 100,000, then 10,000 - when Nato entered Kosovo and sufficient mass graves failed to materialise. </p> <p>True, the nature of the war played into the military's hands in keeping the true face of battle from the public. It was fought entirely from the air by means of a high-altitude bombing campaign, so no one - except the victims - really knew what was happening on the ground. </p> <p>Since they could not go to the fighting, correspondents either gathered at Nato headquarters in Brussels or clustered along the borders of those coun tries surrounding Kosovo and tried to peer over. There they were interviewed on television by fellow journalists in studios in Europe and the United States - who often had to brief them about the latest news before the interview started because the reporter on the spot usually knew nothing. </p> <p>According to veteran correspondent Robert Fisk, one of the few heroes left, this lack of access to the war produced two types of journalists - the \"frothers\" who had \"convinced themselves of the justice of the war and the wickedness of the other side\" - and the \"sheep\" who blindly followed Nato's word. </p> <p>The Russians watched and learned. When Moscow began its campaign against Chechnya, it used a system of news management based on Nato's. An information centre in Moscow offered Nato-style briefings which had to be accepted at face value, while at the front everything possible was done to hinder war correspondents and exclude them from battle zones. They were denied accreditation, detained, searched, intimidated. \"How can you cover a war you can't get to?\" one foreign journalist asked the Moscow Times. </p> <p>The sad truth is that today government propaganda prepares its citizens for war so skilfully that it is quite likely that they do not want the truthful, objective and balanced reporting that hero war correspondents once did their best to provide. </p> <p>Studies carried out after the Gulf war by Dr David Morrison, of the University of Leeds, showed that if there were a British mistake that caused a war to go badly, most people in the study felt that this mistake should never be reported, or only after the war was over. </p> <p>Further, where reporting in the Gulf was dominated by television as in no other war, most viewers were quite content with the reporting and considered it to be accurate and fair. If viewers had any complaint at all, it was that TV stations devoted too much time to the war and that this disrupted their favourite programmes. </p> <p>Armed with information like this, the likelihood is that governments will find further justification for managing the media in wartime. In fact, I predict that control of war correspondents - both open and covert - will be even tighter, and that this will be accepted by most media groups because in wartime they consider their best commercial and political interests lie in supporting the government of the day. </p> <p>\u0095 Phillip Knightley's book, The First Casualty: the War Correspondent as Hero and Myth Maker from the Crimea to Kosovo, is published by Prion Books, price \u00a312</p>",

If viewers had any complaint at all, it was that TV stations devoted too much time to the war and that this disrupted their favourite programmes. Armed with information like this, the likelihood is that governments will find further justification for managing the media in wartime. In fact, I predict that control of war correspondents - both open and covert - will be even tighter, and that this will be accepted by most media groups because in wartime they consider their best commercial and political interests lie in supporting the government of the day. \u0095 Phillip Knightley's book, The First Casualty: the War Correspondent as Hero and Myth Maker from the Crimea to Kosovo, is published by Prion Books, price \u00a312",

      "body": "<p>So you've crumbled. You've installed digital television, become part of a trend. But what will happen to your viewing habits now that you have nearly 200 channels to choose from? </p> <p>Around 3m homes have signed up to digital television over the past 18 months and research suggests that in digital-homes people are viewing differently, displaying a new impatience, dodging adverts and demanding instant gratification. The term used is \"grazing\". </p> <p>Further, according to a study by Nickelodeon, children and teenagers have cottoned on fastest to the power of the electronic programme guide (EPG) - the big difference between analogue and digital television - which calls up networks by scrolling through the choices, as with a computer. Or, as children observe, it's like playing a computer game. </p> <p>Janey Grace, managing director of Nickelodeon, says: \"Audiences seem much less tolerant of the bits in between. They won't watch any clutter, won't watch the adverts. Content is important. If they want Rugrats, they want Rugrats now, and they will scroll down the EPG until they find it.\" </p> <p>\"This is an audience closest to video,\" says Kathryn Mitchell, programming head of the UKTV channels, including the successful UK Gold. As many of the minor channels, such as National Geographic or the BBC's relaunching Arena net work, feature way down the pecking order on the EPG, they have to be content with hauling in tiny numbers of casual viewers.

      "bodyText": "So you've crumbled. You've installed digital television, become part of a trend. But what will happen to your viewing habits now that you have nearly 200 channels to choose from? Around 3m homes have signed up to digital television over the past 18 months and research suggests that in digital-homes people are viewing differently, displaying a new impatience, dodging adverts and demanding instant gratification. The term used is \"grazing\". Further, according to a study by Nickelodeon, children and teenagers have cottoned on fastest to the power of the electronic programme guide (EPG) - the big difference between analogue and digital television - which calls up networks by scrolling through the choices, as with a computer. Or, as children observe, it's like playing a computer game. Janey Grace, managing director of Nickelodeon, says: \"Audiences seem much less tolerant of the bits in between. They won't watch any clutter, won't watch the adverts. Content is important. If they want Rugrats, they want Rugrats now, and they will scroll down the EPG until they find it.\" \"This is an audience closest to video,\" says Kathryn Mitchell, programming head of the UKTV channels, including the successful UK Gold. As many of the minor channels, such as National Geographic or the BBC's relaunching Arena net work, feature way down the pecking order on the EPG, they have to be content with hauling in tiny numbers of casual viewers. If they get 20 minutes or so per week, they are ecstatic, says Ian Lewis, Sky's director of programme and promotional strategy. The more minor channels also attract peak audiences at different times - perhaps 10.30pm, if aimed at adults, or 5pm if, like MTV, they are aimed at teenagers - because the main terrestrial channels throw resources at the hours between 7pm and 10.30pm.

      "body": "<p>The most remarkable thing about the leaks of Greg Dyke's blueprint for the new BBC last week was not the headline figure - 1,000 jobs to go - nor the news that some of the corporation's longest-serving executives might soon be getting their coats. The truly amazing thing was that the BBC, one of the leakiest organisations ever, had managed to keep it quiet for so long. </p> <p>So why did some of the greatest gossips in a notoriously gossipy industry fail to reveal the secret plan emerging from Dyke's review of the corporation, which began when he joined in the autumn? Simple: they didn't know. In fact, no one knew. They still don't. </p> <p>It didn't stop them speculating. \"Isn't it incredible,\" gasped one of the BBC's most acclaimed programme makers, \"how everything that Birt has done is being swept away? It's as if he's never been.\" </p> <p>A note from Dyke, sent to every member of staff on Thursday after the trade magazine Broadcast splashed on the story, was confiding and reassuring, while still failing either to deny the reports or unveil the plan. Affectionately signed \"yours, Greg\" it described the story as speculation and reminded staff that he would announce his plans in a couple of weeks. </p> <p>So with staff none the wiser, the rumour mill went into overdrive. And the name on the lips of those who know enough to know how little they know was Gareth Jones, the BBC's new director of human resources and legal affairs. Professor Jones, who joined the corporation in November to replace Margaret Salmon, was Dyke's first senior appointment. A former colleague of the new DG, he is something of a mystery to the broadcasting types. Aged 39, he was professor of organisational development at Henley Management college, where he was known for his skills in helping managers effect wide-scale cultural change in their organisations. </p> <p>This is his speciality, honed with companies including Polygram International and at academic institutions including the University of East Anglia, the London Business school and the voguish French business school, Insead. </p> <p>Happily, there is an insight into Jones's thinking on the difficulties of changing a company's culture. Gathering dust in the archive of the Harvard Business Review, an illustrious publication, is an article authored by the mastermind behind Dyke's plans. In 1996, along with Rob Goffee - then an LBS professor - Jones wrote What Holds the Modern Company Together. It is a key report. </p> <p>The article shows the influences behind Dyke's plan - the massive cultural sea change he wants to effect, removing the endless managers and helping BBC staff to have fun again. It also shows the motivation behind his \"put up or shut up\" speech to staff when he formally took over, when he told them to leave if they didn't like it. Jones's model would not tolerate creative types bitching about the job instead of doing it. </p> <p>Jones's theory is built on the twin virtues of \"sociability\" and \"solidarity\", which can be combined in varying ratios to achieve various ends. There is no single ideal, according to this theory, and different models can work in different areas. A \"mercenary\" culture can work for a highly competitive, sales-driven organisation where employees expect to work very hard for vast rewards and early retirement. However, for the BBC, it seems the \"communal\" model, where sociability and solidarity meet harmoniously, would be the ideal. </p> <p>Four years ago, Jones and Goffee described the BBC as undergoing an \"uncomfortable transition\". As Birt tried to focus the corporation on efficiency and productivity - dividing producers from broadcasters and establishing the internal market - the BBC became fragmented, they wrote. </p> <p>\"With its communal culture heading toward a fragmented one, the BBC faces no alternative but to invent itself,\" they concluded. How does an organisation change its culture? Jones and Goffee offered a series of steps: promote the sharing of ideas, arrange casual gatherings, reduce formality, limit hierarchical differences, \"act like a friend\", create a sense of urgency and stimulate the will to win. </p> <p>But, they warned, \"before attempting to change levels of sociability or solidarity, a manager needs to think a bit like a doctor taking on a new patient. The patient's past and current condition are not only relevant but also critically important to assessing the best future treatment\". A questionnaire is provided, with which to assess your organisation's culture, with statements such as \"people here do favours for one other because they like one another\" to which the responses are either \"low, medium or high\". One BBC staffer simply burst out laughing in response to that question last week. </p> <p>Some degree of choosiness will no doubt be appropriate when selecting the BBC's future tactics from the list. Limiting hierarchical differences and redesigning the organisational chart - one of the five recommendations for increasing sociability - is clearly well under way. Introducing an annual company picnic might not be wholly welcomed. </p> <p>So far, Dyke's grand plan to turn the BBC into a more productive and happy place has been painted as a slaughter of hundreds of top and middle managers, who will find themselves competing for a vastly reduced number of posts. And that slaughter will happen - it will be vital to meet the promised target of reducing spending on administration from 24% of the BBC's total income to a justifiable 15%. </p> <p>But the real shock to the BBC system will not be the erasure of the current divisions between producers and broadcasters, nor the redistribution of budgets, nor even the rumoured move of Alan Yentob from director of television. According to those who have spoken to Jones, whose touchy-feely style involves chats with key executives over pints of beer, it will be the culture change that is intended to create an effective atmosphere. </p> <p>The Dyke team want to create a fast-reacting organisation, where programme makers feel valued, and where ideas and creative juices flow freely. They want the new departments to be \"small and specialist\", reasoning that this is how programme makers work best. </p> <p>It's no accident that one of the few decisions made in the period of wait ing for the blueprint has been an acceptance that the new digital channels BBC Choice and BBC Knowledge can move into a loft-style office in Mortimer Street, central London, far from the tentacles of the \"big brother\" BBC Television Centre, in White City, west London. </p> <p>A further symptom of the new style is Dyke's much commented-upon dislike of lengthy paper policy documents - he refuses to read them - and a desire for a much better system of internal communication. Nothing is sacred - even the role of Ariel, the BBC's Pravda-like internal weekly newspaper, previously deemed essential for the dissemination of Birtspeak, is up for debate. </p> <p>For many programme makers, the term BBC was associated with Birt and the corporate centre: it was an institution they might have belonged to, but from which they felt alienated. The policy of sending favoured managers off to expensive business school courses at Wharton in the US or Insead is being stopped. So, probably, is the exclusive link with the University of Bradford, which runs a BBC management scheme. The aim is to create a BBC scheme, drawing on the best of business courses. </p> <p>Dyke's team have also been appalled by the civil service feel of the BBC, evidenced by fusty old-fashioned practices such as \"boarding\" applicants for \"posts\" rather than holding interviews for jobs. The new brooms shake their heads at the quaint idea that staff \"go on annual leave\" instead of holidays. </p> <p>One trusted aide last week said the bottom line was simple. \"What does all this mean for Mrs Smith on her sofa? More money to be spent on better programmes. That's it.\" Or as another remarks: \"The key thing is for the BBC to deliver stonking good programmes to the public, and everything else stands in the way of that.\" </p> <p>But the hushed tones and enforced secrecy surrounding Dyke's blueprint cause some old hands to cite the mark of Birt. Carolyn Reynolds, one of the executives trusted to write the plan, is a former McKinsey consultant who joined BBC Worldwide. Robin Foster, who assisted, went on extended leave the moment the blueprint was handed over. \"I'm surprised Dyke hasn't issued a consultation plan. That's what ought to happen,\" said a critic. </p> <p>The expressed fear is that the change will be so sharp and swift that a further shakedown will be needed in 18 months. The great variation in the predictions of job losses comes from the estimates made by those informed of the outline plan. Though several hundred will go at first, Dyke will not immediately lay down targets for further restructuring within the 16 new departments. That will be left to their new heads. </p> <p>The programme makers should have nothing to worry about - save any personal aversion to company picnics and the like, but of course the waiting seems endless. As one key senior executive said last week, \"I've put all my plans on hold until I know what the final version is.\" </p> <p>For, in a period of great change, there are countless tales of people rushing to grab territory and rubbish old rivals or enemies. Some of the governors are thought to be unnerved by the thought of their director-general line-managing 16 separate departments. Some staff are running a book on who will be the first senior manager to go. Whatever Dyke promises about his all-new BBC, it's not all sweetness and light.</p>",

Achilles had got the hump and was sulking in his tent; while he was out of action, the emboldened Trojans were threatening to drive the Greeks back into the sea. </p> <p>In the nick of time, Achilles re-entered the fray. He donned his gleaming golden armour and rode out on to the battlefield, where his very presence was enough to raise the flagging spirits of the Greeks and strike terror into the hearts of the Trojans. He then proceeded to slaughter everybody in sight. </p> <p>Labour MPs are banking on Gordon Brown doing for them what Achilles did for the Greeks. While the chancellor has been away from the battlefield preparing his budget, the government has been having a thoroughly rotten time of it, culminating in last week's decision by BMW to give up on Longbridge. There is a sullen mood out in the heartlands, while for the first time since their trouncing almost three years ago the Conservatives have rediscovered some of their old swagger. </p> <p>Brown has not exactly been sulking in his tent, but his low profile since the turn of the year has meant that not only has he escaped any blame for the government's current woes but is seen as the only man who can turn the tide back in the government's favour. If the chancellor can put the Tories to flight tomorrow and garner the right sort of headlines in Wednesday's papers, Labour MPs will forget that Brown has been responsible for the government's perceived failures - the cash crisis in the NHS, for example - as well as its successes. </p> <p><strong> Hard cash</strong><br> </p> <p> And, on the face of it, the chancellor has everything in his favour. The economy did better than expected last year, allowing the treasury to build up a hefty fiscal surplus. There is money in the bank - so much money that Brown is able to do what Nigel Lawson did in the late 80s - cut taxes, raise spending and pay off debt all at the same time. Given the current gloom and despondency in Labour's ranks, it would be the simplest thing in the world for the chancellor to hand out a few lollipops tomorrow, but the budget is likely to be a bit more complex than that. </p> <p>Brown's first consideration is the need to dovetail fiscal policy with monetary policy. In theory, he could blow the entire surplus on tax cuts or higher spending, but the Bank of England would almost certainly respond by banging up interest rates to compensate for the boost to demand. At a time when there is justifiable concern about the strength of the pound, this would not be the wisest course of action and, in terms of macro-economic management, there is a case for even tougher fiscal policy so that monetary policy takes less of the strain in holding inflation to the government's 2.5% target. </p> <p>However, tightening fiscal policy is tricky when the government is already running a whopping surplus, the voters are spitting blood about the state of schools and hospitals, and the Conservatives are banging on day after day about how the tax burden has increased under Labour. </p> <p>So how does the treasury cope with this dilemma? The macro-economic assumption will be that the effects of higher interest rates and the strong pound will start to slow the economy down during the course of this year, making a modest relaxation of fiscal policy acceptable. However, this will probably be limited to the minimum necessary to prevent the tax burden from rising due to the effects of fiscal drag, whereby people pay more to the inland revenue as their incomes rise. In hard cash, this means that Brown would have to cut taxes by around \u00a32bn to keep the tax burden where it is, \u00a33bn to reduce it. </p> <p>If anything, the willingness of Downing Street to admit for the first time last week that the tax burden has gone up under Labour suggests that it might be the higher of the two figures, and that the Conservatives are being lured on to a sucker punch. </p> <p><strong> Missing link</strong><br> </p> <p> All the indications are that the beneficiaries of the chancellor's largesse will be those he considers the deserving rich and the deserving poor. The budget's theme is the need to raise Britain's economic performance to close the productivity gap with Germany, France and the United States, so there will be tax breaks on share options for the new breed of entrepreneurs starting up their own companies, together with tax credits for spending on research and development. At the other end of the scale, Brown is likely to increase the generosity of the working families tax credit and levy the 10p starting rate of tax on a higher slice of taxable income. </p> <p>Some of the other likely measures have already been well trailed. There will be measures designed to bring a halt to the housing boom in the south, while the rise in global oil prices means that the policy of increasing petrol duties by well in excess of inflation has been junked. </p> <p>But there is still something missing. Brown loves to plan for the long term, but as the prime minister has no doubt reminded his chancellor, the long term is a series of short terms. And in the short term, the government is in trouble and needs a political boost from the budget. So what is it to be? Another cut in the basic rate of income tax? A reduction in duties on booze and fags? Or something else? </p> <p><strong> Squaring circles</strong><br> </p> <p> Let us look at it from the government's point of view. Despite all the recent fuss, there has been quite substantial redistribution over the past three years but in two key areas it is felt that Labour has not delivered. The first is the provision of public services - particularly health and education. The second is pensions. </p> <p>On spending, Labour's parsimony in its first two years has now come back to haunt it. Budgets for health and education are now increasing by 5% in real terms, but it will take time to make good the effects of the earlier freeze, let alone deliver the improvements the electorate thought it was voting for in 1997. Up until now, the strategy has been to announce a new three-year spending deal in the summer, promising at least the same inflation-busting deal for health and education until well into the next parliament. That would allow Alan Milburn and David Blunkett to hand out all sorts of goodies during the autumn, softening up voters for an election next spring. </p> <p>Brown may now be forced to rethink the timing of this approach. Assumptions have to be made in the budget about spending, and the chancellor could make a virtue of necessity by announcing that public spending can rise by at least as much in the second three-year spending round as it did in the first, with the government again focussing on its priorities of health and education. Specific commitments for individual departments look less likely at this stage because the treasury wants to ensure, particularly in health, that extra cash is accompanied by reform. </p> <p>One group that has not featured in the pre-budget speculation has been pensioners, which is strange given that pensioners are well organised, vociferous and extremely unhappy with the government. Rather than restore the link between the universal state pension and earnings, Brown has plumped for a means-testing approach, arguing that he wants to focus support on the poorest pensioners. </p> <p>Squaring this circle is not going to be easy. Unless the chancellor is prepared to abandon his whole approach to the welfare state, he is not going to announce a big increase in the state pension. But he is a strong believer in tax credits, and there is nothing to stop him extending the principle to pensioners, many of whom pay tax on savings. A properly tapered pensioners tax credit would allow those on modest income to escape tax altogether without applying to wealthy pensioners. </p> <p>While this will not go far enough for pensioners groups, my guess is that the chancellor will once again be the darling of Labour MPs come tomorrow night. Whether the budget is a long-term solution to the government's travails remains to be seen. Achilles, it should be remembered, did not win the Trojan war, he merely saved the Greeks from defeat. In the end, he had a weak spot. So, too, does Mr Brown: the strength of the pound.</p>",

Most research we were able to do quickly and easily online because of the vast amount of information available now on the net. The market was certainly big enough to be attractive - teenagers in Britain spend at least \u00a33bn each year, mostly on fun stuff (music and videos rather than mortgages) which is ripe for online purchases. Teenagers we spoke to were also very enthusiastic about the service. </p> <p>The US is often the lead for internet activity and the discovery that there were similar services operating there gave us heart, suggesting as it did that the core business model was sound. Although there appeared to be no direct competition in Europe, it would be dangerously naive to assume that others would not also be attracted to this valuable market. </p> <p>Things do move incredibly fast and markets become crowded very quickly - a review of recent American company flotations revealed hundreds of copycat versions of well known brands such as <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com\">Amazon</a> and<a href=\"http://www.yahoo.com\">Yahoo</a>, all entering already highly competitive sectors with no discernable unique proposition or innovative technology. </p> <p>We looked into the technology that would be required (it could be done but we would have to invest a lot in security processes and systems) and our legal position, where we took guidance from the financial services authority. </p> <p>Despite the popular media perception (only slightly tongue-in-cheek) that internet businesses are valued more highly the greater the losses they make, it is vitally important for us to identify a realistic route to profitability. We believe that online businesses which aim to attract large numbers of customers but which have no clarity about how to make money are not going to survive in the medium to long term. (We were amazed to read only recently of an online business launched last year which was still looking at revenue streams to determine a potential profit.) </p> <p>If our numbers are correct (and we ran through a number of extremely pessimistic scenarios) we would become profitable within a relatively short period of time, possibly even by year two. </p> <p>Our initial investment in a week of heavy research and planning has paid dividends throughout the subsequent months. We had to build a company with a \"unique proposition\" - and a long term future. Our business has to \"create value\". </p> <p>It also has to have the room to grow so geographic expansion (Europe and beyond) and alternative platforms (Wap, digital TV and the Next Big Thing) are core components of our plans. </p> <p>However, we are acutely aware that our idea is worthless until we convert it effectively (and very quickly) into a real business. There is widely held view in the industry that there is no shortage of ideas but that it is the ability to execute that differentiates a successful business from those that fall away. After all, there is only so much planning you can do... </p> <p>\u0095 Adam Hamdy and Guy Mallison are co-founders of <a href=\"http://www.rools.com \">Rools.com </a></p>",

The US is often the lead for internet activity and the discovery that there were similar services operating there gave us heart, suggesting as it did that the core business model was sound. Although there appeared to be no direct competition in Europe, it would be dangerously naive to assume that others would not also be attracted to this valuable market. Things do move incredibly fast and markets become crowded very quickly - a review of recent American company flotations revealed hundreds of copycat versions of well known brands such as Amazon andYahoo, all entering already highly competitive sectors with no discernable unique proposition or innovative technology. We looked into the technology that would be required (it could be done but we would have to invest a lot in security processes and systems) and our legal position, where we took guidance from the financial services authority. Despite the popular media perception (only slightly tongue-in-cheek) that internet businesses are valued more highly the greater the losses they make, it is vitally important for us to identify a realistic route to profitability. We believe that online businesses which aim to attract large numbers of customers but which have no clarity about how to make money are not going to survive in the medium to long term. (We were amazed to read only recently of an online business launched last year which was still looking at revenue streams to determine a potential profit.) If our numbers are correct (and we ran through a number of extremely pessimistic scenarios) we would become profitable within a relatively short period of time, possibly even by year two. Our initial investment in a week of heavy research and planning has paid dividends throughout the subsequent months. We had to build a company with a \"unique proposition\" - and a long term future. Our business has to \"create value\". It also has to have the room to grow so geographic expansion (Europe and beyond) and alternative platforms (Wap, digital TV and the Next Big Thing) are core components of our plans. However, we are acutely aware that our idea is worthless until we convert it effectively (and very quickly) into a real business. There is widely held view in the industry that there is no shortage of ideas but that it is the ability to execute that differentiates a successful business from those that fall away. After all, there is only so much planning you can do... \u0095 Adam Hamdy and Guy Mallison are co-founders of Rools.com",

IPC Electric's acting MD and commercial director Julian Hardy left in November after only three months in the job. Two months later, new chief Ren\u00e9 Carayol also quit the company. Ellis Watson at the Sun's currantbun.com and Guardian Unlimited's Justin Walters both left their top jobs recently, the latter to pursue his own start-up project. After three-and-a-half years at Associated, Dunn has done the same. </p> <p>He calls it a \"half-departure\". Associated is funding the initial costs of his start-up and has first refusal on its products in an arrangement that Dunn calls a \"Hollywood producer model\". It is an innovative option that he believes other traditional media companies may take up to keep new media talent on board. \"A lot of the ideas you see for great opportunities on the internet are totally unrelated to the traditional media company's core business, so you need to make that autonomy [between new and old media] even greater,\" he says. </p> <p>\"It is difficult for traditional media companies at the moment because there are many start-ups ploughing into this market which offer seemingly lucrative share packages,\" Dunn says. \"However, looking at the way some of the share prices have fallen recently, I wonder if that is going to continue. The stability that a traditional, solid media company can offer may become more attractive again.\" </p> <p>But industry insiders speculate that the sometimes fraught relationship between new media spin-offs and the core business within a traditional media company often forces people out. \"What often drives out heads of new media [in traditional media companies] is that they get insufficient support from the newspaper,\" says one. \"Dunn's biggest gripe is that it took three years to put This Is London's URL on the cover of the Evening Standard.\" </p> <p>The Financial Times has also been hit by defections to start-ups. The departure of Lex columnist Hugo Dixon and his colleague Jonathan Ford to Breakingviews.com, helped push Pearson to consider an options package for its web journalists to block the brain drain. </p> <p>But FT.com's editor, Paul Maidment - one of the few at the top of traditional media's online offerings not to move on in the past year - is now finding it easier to attract credible candidates for middle-ranking positions, having recruited 100 editorial staff in the past 12 months. Boosted by Pearson's January share issue, which raised a further \u00a3250m for FT's internet projects, more recruitment is sure to follow. </p> <p>\"There was a concern before the last recruitment drive that we would not be able to find people with adequate experience and quality,\" says Maidment. \"But that's not actually proved to be the case. We have got past the black-hole generation of people who didn't have enough experience editorially but had a little bit of web experience. We now have people with a fair chunk of both and we've deepened our gene pool as a news organisation as a result.\" </p> <p>Keeping middle-ranking staff can also be difficult. Dunn says Associated was \"remarkably resilient\" in terms of staff stability. \"But if you have long-serving staff, their skill set becomes enormously valuable so you become a prime target for any start-ups entering the UK market.\" </p> <p>Traditional media reporters may enviously believe that new media journalists are constantly in demand and swimming in stock options. However, some online journalists are less than content, complaining that any chance to do \"proper\" journalism is squeezed out by understaffed operations simply charged with repackaging newspaper or broadcasting content for the internet. </p> <p>\"If we want to call ourselves real reporters we will only be considered so when we start breaking stories and coming up with original material,\" says one unhappy online hack, whose day is often spent wrestling with the labour-intensive production system used to publish internet content. </p> <p>While most online journalists who work for established news organisations' online offshoots rarely leave their desks, Roisin Heycock, who moved from an FT.com production job to Complinet, an online news service for business subscribers, reports a happier experience. She uses the internet to find stories, but says she \"still does what traditional journalists do, ringing round, going to conferences, and going to court\". </p> <p>Working in a dedicated online environment, she says she does not suffer from the inferiority complex that many online journalists in traditional news organisations report. Lowly status is the inevitable result of an unequal relationship between new internet divisions with young employees and established news operations, which see their online set-up simply as a way of publishing their content on a different platform. </p> <p>\"The only way organisations will have their online and print journalists considered the same in terms of status will be if they share common terms and conditions,\" says Maidment, whose latest recruitment round shunned short-term contracts and offered the FT's internet journalists \"staff jobs which have the opportunity for long-term careers on the FT. </p> <p>\"We've created a completely integrated newsroom that works across print and online, so we don't have FT.com journalists and we don't have newspaper journalists. We just have FT journalists. We believe very strongly that what we produce every day is FT journalism,\" he says. </p> <p>It is this integration of online and offline operations in traditional media companies that many bosses hope will solve some of the problems of staffing the new media revolution. </p> <p>The first likely consequence of integration is that traditional journalists will become \"online\" journalists, honing their internet research skills. \"I think all journalists need to develop online skills because that is where information now flows from,\" says one online financial journalist. \"I don't think all will. Some will have to change and develop new skills, some will retire.\" </p> <p>The second consequence of integration is that as the internet is colonised by print and broadcast journalists, some online journalists will be sidelined into the mouse-clicking monotony that is \"producing\" others' content for internet publication. And this could recreate many of the staffing problems that integration is supposed to solve. </p> <p>As one online journalist says: \"If you reduce the people who work on the web to mere robots and production machines I don't think they'd be happy or stay around for long. You have got to make sure your online journalists have something to write about.\"</p>",

But FT.com's editor, Paul Maidment - one of the few at the top of traditional media's online offerings not to move on in the past year - is now finding it easier to attract credible candidates for middle-ranking positions, having recruited 100 editorial staff in the past 12 months. Boosted by Pearson's January share issue, which raised a further \u00a3250m for FT's internet projects, more recruitment is sure to follow. \"There was a concern before the last recruitment drive that we would not be able to find people with adequate experience and quality,\" says Maidment. \"But that's not actually proved to be the case. We have got past the black-hole generation of people who didn't have enough experience editorially but had a little bit of web experience. We now have people with a fair chunk of both and we've deepened our gene pool as a news organisation as a result.\" Keeping middle-ranking staff can also be difficult. Dunn says Associated was \"remarkably resilient\" in terms of staff stability. \"But if you have long-serving staff, their skill set becomes enormously valuable so you become a prime target for any start-ups entering the UK market.\" Traditional media reporters may enviously believe that new media journalists are constantly in demand and swimming in stock options. However, some online journalists are less than content, complaining that any chance to do \"proper\" journalism is squeezed out by understaffed operations simply charged with repackaging newspaper or broadcasting content for the internet. \"If we want to call ourselves real reporters we will only be considered so when we start breaking stories and coming up with original material,\" says one unhappy online hack, whose day is often spent wrestling with the labour-intensive production system used to publish internet content. While most online journalists who work for established news organisations' online offshoots rarely leave their desks, Roisin Heycock, who moved from an FT.com production job to Complinet, an online news service for business subscribers, reports a happier experience. She uses the internet to find stories, but says she \"still does what traditional journalists do, ringing round, going to conferences, and going to court\". Working in a dedicated online environment, she says she does not suffer from the inferiority complex that many online journalists in traditional news organisations report. Lowly status is the inevitable result of an unequal relationship between new internet divisions with young employees and established news operations, which see their online set-up simply as a way of publishing their content on a different platform. \"The only way organisations will have their online and print journalists considered the same in terms of status will be if they share common terms and conditions,\" says Maidment, whose latest recruitment round shunned short-term contracts and offered the FT's internet journalists \"staff jobs which have the opportunity for long-term careers on the FT. \"We've created a completely integrated newsroom that works across print and online, so we don't have FT.com journalists and we don't have newspaper journalists. We just have FT journalists. We believe very strongly that what we produce every day is FT journalism,\" he says. It is this integration of online and offline operations in traditional media companies that many bosses hope will solve some of the problems of staffing the new media revolution. The first likely consequence of integration is that traditional journalists will become \"online\" journalists, honing their internet research skills. \"I think all journalists need to develop online skills because that is where information now flows from,\" says one online financial journalist. \"I don't think all will. Some will have to change and develop new skills, some will retire.\" The second consequence of integration is that as the internet is colonised by print and broadcast journalists, some online journalists will be sidelined into the mouse-clicking monotony that is \"producing\" others' content for internet publication. And this could recreate many of the staffing problems that integration is supposed to solve. As one online journalist says: \"If you reduce the people who work on the web to mere robots and production machines I don't think they'd be happy or stay around for long. You have got to make sure your online journalists have something to write about.\"",

The charges are the equivalent of each household in the country paying from \u00a340 to \u00a3400 too much for banking services, the report says. The inquiry team investigating the banking industry, headed by former telecommunications regulator Don Cruickshank, called for a radical shake-up of the sector. Mr Cruickshank said of his report: \"It says that if there was effective competition in banking, prices would be between \u00a33bn and \u00a35bn less than they are now\u0085 And you would get better service. \"What I'm saying is government [should] act on one of the root causes, which is the way the payments system is run and managed by the banks. \"There are real problems with the way banks control the networks which allow money to flow around the economy, whether it be cheques, credit and debit cards or electronic transfers, big and small. \"Cash machines are just the tip of that iceberg.\" The Cruickshank report recommends that the handling of small business accounts should be referred to the competition commission - \"which should bring with it the threat of the break-up of the big four's business in that area\". The British bankers' association said it needed time to study the report, but a spokesman insisted banks were competitive. \"Nothing in this report shakes our belief that this is a highly competitive industry,\" he said. \"This is a very effective, important industry which is one of Britain's market leaders.\" Key recommendations of the Cruickshank report \u0095 A new payments regulator (PayCom) to supervise a licensing regime for banks' cash and payments networks - including cheque clearance and automatic cash machines \u0095 Better information to help those currently excluded from banking services to find the best banking deal \u0095 Measures to end banks' monopolies on services to small and medium-sized firms. \u0095 Creating a basic bank account for the many people who do not have one \u0095 Introducing better complaint-handling procedures for personal customers and small and medium-sized businesses \u0095 Developing benchmarks for banking services to help consumers make informed choices.

      "trailText": "<p>Alain de Botton propelled a book about Proust to the top of the US bestseller list, he boasts a devoted throng of thoughtful women but he is very nervous about the future.</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Alain de Botton, the 30-year-old literary philosopher, the man with all the answers, has an old head on his young shoulders, a head from which even a central strip of hair has been expelled as if its growth was a distraction to thought. His angular face, the bones like tent poles beneath his skin, is earnest, his light grey eyes intense. We meet to discuss his latest book (and television series), The Consolations of Philosophy. His last book was about Proust. This one is about Seneca and Schopenhauer, Socrates and Nietzsche, Epicurus and Montaigne. </p> <p>He is sitting across the table from me in a central London cafe. He is sipping hot chocolate. He is saying: \"You know it was that kind of transition thing. I was 23 when I met her and then suddenly you're 27... and there's that terrible thing when you're 23 that no one tells you that a woman you're going to be with is going to be thinking very seriously about marriage, so you'd better watch out. So when you do realise, you walk. I mean, she was right, but not right forever. So then I was single for a while.\" He's talking faster and faster, pausing only for his tongue to dab at the stray globs of foam which keep adhering to his upper lip. </p> <p>\"I couldn't even manage meaningless affairs, they were too meaningful. There's no such thing really as casual sex. It's always heavy and complicated. And then we were filming this series and we were looking for someone to illustrate the ideas of Schopenhauer, we needed someone with a broken heart and we were desperate\" - dab at glob - \"and I was talking to my editor at Penguin and I said, 'It's a real crisis, we can't find anyone,' and he said, 'Well actually there is someone here, in another department, recently dumped by her boyfriend.' So then that afternoon, there she was, her heart freshly broken and it's terrible for her and I was interviewing her and I thought, 'This is nice.' She was looking melancholic which is always very attractive - the unhappiness of women: exciting. So then at the end of the interview I said, 'Do you want to come out to dinner?' and we started going out. And that was last summer.\" </p> <p>He breaks off. His large lips break into a broad smile. She is very sporty, he tells me. She wears a Baby-G watch. She goes rollerblading, \"which makes me feel threatened\". But he looks very happy about it. </p> <p>De Botton, or Dr Love as he's known to the throngs of thoughtful girls with waistlength hair who attend his bookshop readings (and who may be disappointed to hear of the latest moves in his romantic life), doesn't hold with the separation of grand ideas and small everyday concerns. The three novels he wrote in his precocious mid-20s were as much about relativism, naturalism, pessimism as about the dating game. </p> <p>How Proust Can Change Your Life, which jostled in the US bestseller lists alongside the Chicken Soup self-help manuals, sought out advice for unhappy lovers along with the hints for catching up on lost time. And The Consolations of Philosophy applies ancient ideas to, among things, not having enough money, not doing as well as you think you ought to be, and not getting it up. </p> <p>\"Most modern philosophy is about mathematics, moving very carefully through an argument,\" says de Botton, frowning. \"The guys I've chosen are interested in wisdom, in how you live your life.\" </p> <p>The book contains some personal details, the unsatisfied desire for a house in Kensington's Campden Hill Road (see Happiness: An Acquisition List), an incident of impotence on holiday in Portugal with a girl called L (\"Oh L?\" he says. \"L is a long time ago. L is in fact A, for what it's worth\"). But for the most part, you can't help wondering how much consolation de Botton can need himself. He comes from a wealthy family. Swiss upbringing, houses in Chelsea, father in banking, mother in Washington. His stepmother is the art collector and benefactress Janet de Botton. Usually voluble, he talks about his provenance in staccato bites (\"Weird background. Strange name. Outsider/insider all that. Stepmother, yup, fantastically rich\"). </p> <p>He went to Harrow, where he was miserable and didn't meet any girls (\"If you're a certain kind of boy you don't fare well in adolescence\"), and Cambridge, where he wasn't and did. Then he began a PhD in French 17th-century philosophy, and wrote Essays in Love, his first novel. It earned him \u00a350,000 for the German rights alone, so he never had to get a proper job. </p> <p>The Proust book was a bit of a wobble - his publisher was uneasy about it from the beginning - but then, boom, John Updike gave it a rave in the New Yorker and sales rocketed. Bestseller city. He's just bought his first home, a house in Hammersmith. Alone for now, but things are \"on the horizon\". Money, property, success, and now love. Quite consoling, all in all? </p> <p>\"No, no,\" he says. \"Anxiety, God. I have anxiety about the future. Always the panic. Am I going to write again? It's horrible. I see my talent as a flickering flame that's always in danger of going out forever. We're nervous Jews, my whole family. We're jittery. We're all -\" He waggles his shoulders and shakes his hands in the air. \"Completely hysterical. A door slams and -\" He mimes freezing in terror. </p> <p>\"We all think everything's going to go wrong. From the age of one, my father always thought he was going to go bankrupt - his parents had gone bankrupt several times - so he has that immigrant destitute mentality which is: 'This is not going to last', and I think you pass it on to your children. My father, who was born in Egypt, was always like: 'You're an outsider, you may be put in a ghetto at any time and be killed.' It was always: 'Don't take anything for granted.' Also,\" he adds, \"very demanding parents. Coming back from school. Ten A grades. 'Why not 15?' Always disapproving.\" </p> <p>The disapproval gene has not been entirely passed over. De Botton may chat happily, like a close girlfriend, about the problems of moving to the country (\"What happens if someone says, 'Come to lunch', and I'm three hours away by train?\"), of the urge for the mini-break (\"Stage one is: 'We're so in love we're not going out\"; and then stage two is: \"Let's try and take our love to Brussels\"). But there are moments of icy superiority. </p> <p>Of John Updike's career-making review, he says: \"I don't know John Updike. I don't even like John Updike.\" Of the television series to accompany his book (called Philosophy: A Guide to Happiness), he says disloyally, \"It's quite a crappy programme. It's divided into half hours and it's dumbed down.\" </p> <p>He spends his money on books, he says. \"But weird things, psychology. Not novels. Most novels just tell you a story and then they stop. I get bored of stories.\" He likes art, but not his stepmother's sort of art: \"She likes canvasses with 'Fuck' written all over them. I don't. I like small pictures of a jug and an apple and some sunlight coming in.\" </p> <p>He hates noise. On this, he is more Schopenhauer (only brutes don't notice noise) than Seneca (rise above it). He wrote his last book in \"a family house\" in Chelsea and \"the whole street was being redone, every house, monstrous noise, banging from morning to night, drilling the road . . . And I've got this noisy neighbour. It can drive you to crime it really can. I tend to think this man is so vulgar and coarse to be playing his music at 3am and he's laughing and and . . . he's a hooligan.\" </p> <p>His old head is nodding vigorously as he recounts this, his mustard and cress tufts of hair waving. He says he hopes that \"in my advancing years I'll get more relaxed about things and take a more fatalistic attitude and not care so much\". But for now he'll define his own philosophy as a kind of \"jolly pessimism. I think Montaigne's an appealing figure. Nice life. Nice castle. I think Nietzsche's brilliant, but one wouldn't want to be him. Must have been a nightmare. My mother thinks I'm like Schopenhauer because he had a dreadful relationship with his mother. And I do love his pessimism. It makes me laugh when he says it's quite obvious that life's meaningless, that all love affairs are doomed.\" </p> <p>He laughs cheerily. Even yours? I venture. \"I think it's very very tricky to get right,\" he says. \"Like finding a house. On the whole, most of us live in houses that are slightly unsatisfactory and in a way my maturest reflection on love is that relationships work best when you don't put all your eggs in the relationship basket, let go of that romantic idea of finding everything in the other person.\" </p> <p>If not a mini-break, what about a holiday, I suggest, now the book's finished? \"Where to go? Where to go?\" he says anxiously. \"I don't do holidays. You can't find nice hotels, somewhere nice to sit, like a verandah, where you can sit and read and where the pool isn't too noisy. A nice view. It's so hard.\" He looks agonised. </p> <p>I start flicking through his book trying to find a bit on hotel consolation. \"You end up in a room next to the generator,\" he says grumpily. \"Next to this or next to that.\" And there doesn't seem to be an answer to that one.</p>",

Quite consoling, all in all? \"No, no,\" he says. \"Anxiety, God. I have anxiety about the future. Always the panic. Am I going to write again? It's horrible. I see my talent as a flickering flame that's always in danger of going out forever. We're nervous Jews, my whole family. We're jittery. We're all -\" He waggles his shoulders and shakes his hands in the air. \"Completely hysterical. A door slams and -\" He mimes freezing in terror. \"We all think everything's going to go wrong. From the age of one, my father always thought he was going to go bankrupt - his parents had gone bankrupt several times - so he has that immigrant destitute mentality which is: 'This is not going to last', and I think you pass it on to your children. My father, who was born in Egypt, was always like: 'You're an outsider, you may be put in a ghetto at any time and be killed.' It was always: 'Don't take anything for granted.' Also,\" he adds, \"very demanding parents. Coming back from school. Ten A grades. 'Why not 15?' Always disapproving.\" The disapproval gene has not been entirely passed over. De Botton may chat happily, like a close girlfriend, about the problems of moving to the country (\"What happens if someone says, 'Come to lunch', and I'm three hours away by train?\"), of the urge for the mini-break (\"Stage one is: 'We're so in love we're not going out\"; and then stage two is: \"Let's try and take our love to Brussels\"). But there are moments of icy superiority. Of John Updike's career-making review, he says: \"I don't know John Updike. I don't even like John Updike.\" Of the television series to accompany his book (called Philosophy: A Guide to Happiness), he says disloyally, \"It's quite a crappy programme. It's divided into half hours and it's dumbed down.\" He spends his money on books, he says. \"But weird things, psychology. Not novels. Most novels just tell you a story and then they stop. I get bored of stories.\" He likes art, but not his stepmother's sort of art: \"She likes canvasses with 'Fuck' written all over them. I don't. I like small pictures of a jug and an apple and some sunlight coming in.\" He hates noise. On this, he is more Schopenhauer (only brutes don't notice noise) than Seneca (rise above it). He wrote his last book in \"a family house\" in Chelsea and \"the whole street was being redone, every house, monstrous noise, banging from morning to night, drilling the road . . . And I've got this noisy neighbour. It can drive you to crime it really can. I tend to think this man is so vulgar and coarse to be playing his music at 3am and he's laughing and and . . . he's a hooligan.\" His old head is nodding vigorously as he recounts this, his mustard and cress tufts of hair waving. He says he hopes that \"in my advancing years I'll get more relaxed about things and take a more fatalistic attitude and not care so much\". But for now he'll define his own philosophy as a kind of \"jolly pessimism. I think Montaigne's an appealing figure. Nice life. Nice castle. I think Nietzsche's brilliant, but one wouldn't want to be him. Must have been a nightmare. My mother thinks I'm like Schopenhauer because he had a dreadful relationship with his mother. And I do love his pessimism. It makes me laugh when he says it's quite obvious that life's meaningless, that all love affairs are doomed.\" He laughs cheerily. Even yours? I venture. \"I think it's very very tricky to get right,\" he says. \"Like finding a house. On the whole, most of us live in houses that are slightly unsatisfactory and in a way my maturest reflection on love is that relationships work best when you don't put all your eggs in the relationship basket, let go of that romantic idea of finding everything in the other person.\" If not a mini-break, what about a holiday, I suggest, now the book's finished? \"Where to go? Where to go?\" he says anxiously. \"I don't do holidays. You can't find nice hotels, somewhere nice to sit, like a verandah, where you can sit and read and where the pool isn't too noisy. A nice view. It's so hard.\" He looks agonised. I start flicking through his book trying to find a bit on hotel consolation. \"You end up in a room next to the generator,\" he says grumpily. \"Next to this or next to that.\" And there doesn't seem to be an answer to that one.",

      "body": "<p>There is something unsettling about the route that links Manchester and its siamese twin Salford. The two cities are connected to each other and the much-hyped new Lowry Centre by smooth, reliable and fast trams - as good as you'll find in most major European cities - and an all but disused canal that connects the landlocked pair to Liverpool and thus the oceans of the world. </p> <p>Follow the towpath and you'll be gobsmacked by the sheer banality of the mismatching rows of vaguely postmodern offices and apartment blocks that have been rushed up here over the past decade in the name of urban regeneration. They barely deserve to be called \"architecture\". </p> <p>Take a tram from central Manchester, in front of the sadly neglected Piccadilly Hotel, and soak up the terracotta, marble and harsh brick braggadocio of the Victorian city. The tram gathers speed down wide boulevards, roars over a former Midland Railway bridge and begins its rollercoaster journey along the canal. Now look out of the window. What do you see? Gimcrack office blocks and housing that makes the meretricious architecture of London's docklands seem the stuff of Italian renaissance cities. These cynical new buildings (buy one, someone said to me, and you get two free), continue to the point where Manchester becomes Salford and the canal opens up. </p> <p>Here, a giant new shopping complex, a grim new multi-storey car park (nearly complete) and a bridge to bring the tram from Piccadilly will eventually rub shoulders with the Lowry Centre, which opens next month. This massive arts complex is at the heart of a dream to bring a cultural renaissance and new prosperity to Manchester and Salford. </p> <p>Photographs of the \u00a370m Lowry Centre, a multi-purpose \"landmark\" cultural venue and one of the many architectural projects supported by the Millennium Commission and National Lottery money, are taken almost exclusively from a viewpoint denied to visitors arriving by tram or car from central Manchester. From this perspective it recalls Frank Gehry's Guggenheim museum in Bilbao, but surrounded by a plethora of other, lesser buildings. Most visitors, meanwhile, first see it through the concrete grid of the new 670-space multi-storey car park. Subtle. </p> <p>The Lowry Centre is just one link in a chain of arts and sports buildings that, in theory, should make Salford an unmissable leisure destination. There's Old Trafford, Man United's lucrative ground, the northern outpost of the Imperial War Museum - an explosion of a building by Daniel Libeskind - and other potential crowd-pleasers. Will they draw the millions of visitors they are expected to? Can their lively architecture make up for the sorry stuff that lines the old canal? Maybe. Certainly the Libeskind building will be a draw in its own right. As with the same architect's Jewish Museum in Berlin, many people will want to see this megablast of a building for its own sake. </p> <p>And the Lowry? Maybe. But, just as the regeneration of canalside Manchester is confusing, so is this cultural castle. What looks like a book of architectural quotations drawn up on a heroic scale by Michael Wilford and Partners is, between its stainless steel covers, an exhausting read. Gehry's Guggenheim it ain't. There are two theatres, a round tower and long gallery for artworks (including LS Lowry's depressing paintings of depressed matchbox people), a labyrinth of display areas, an \"inter active\" children's gallery, rooms with the best views set aside for private functions just like a billion-pound football club, and what feels to be miles of ramps, stairs and corridors, some set under wave-like ceilings weaving around the stainless steel-clad structure and holding the whole caboodle together. </p> <p>This is an exhausting building to look at - too many notes, as Emperor Joseph II says to the prodigious Mozart in Amadeus - and no less tiring inside. So much packed in. So much to do. So many choices. Buildings within buildings like a Russian doll. Garish colours. No punctuation. No space to pause and rest. An architectural rattle box designed as if this was the architect's one big moment and he was going to stir every idea into the mix in case the next major commission was a long time coming. Still, if the shows in the theatres are good and the art exhibitions well done - which they should be - this monument to England's curious obsession with the millennium may meet with the success that its bravura, flag-waving architecture works so hard to signal. </p> <p>But there are two questions that no one - least of all architects - wants or dares to ask. First, how far can art and culture regenerate an out-of-town area, especially if has been blighted by unattractive new development over the past few years? Second, should we have abandoned multi-purpose civic buildings of this scale - brainchildren of the 60s and 70s - some while back? </p> <p>It's a tricky one, the arts and culture bit. Central Manchester is far more lively today than it was 15 or 20 years ago, but still needs major investment to pull it together as the grand European city it wants to be. Its hotels, museums and art galleries all need a shot in the arm. Its many empty and boarded-up buildings - many of them impressive structures - need new uses and imaginative refurbishment. There are far too many holes in the city, like the missing bits of a jigsaw puzzle. </p> <p>It seems a shame that the centre of the city is so flawed, despite the bold efforts that have been made to repair it since the IRA ripped a part of its heart out. Investment along the canal might have been better delayed until the centre was sorted out and a proper plan put in hand for the long stretches of urban wasteland between here and Salford. An arts renaissance might have been best concentrated in the city centre, helping to give Manchester the cultural concentration and creative energy that make a city premier league rather than first division. This is where Milan wins over Manchester, Barcelona over Birmingham. Sort out the centre first. Work your way out into the edges with a plan in mind and not on a developer's wing and a millennial prayer. </p> <p>The second question is about planning. Perhaps what Salford needs is not a multi-storey car park with a multiplex arts centre attached, but a new city square reached by the tram from Piccadilly, with a stunning new theatre, museum, art gallery, cinema, restaurant, cafes set around it. Market stalls on weekends. Live music. A real place that everyone might enjoy even if they don't go to concerts or plays. Urban regeneration does not come about by car parks, tramless spaces and multi-purpose arts complexes. It needs more subtle planning than this, particularly in such a wind-swept spot: planning that allows natural growth. Every day.</p>",

Somehow, out of the jaws of humiliation, Curtly and Co grabbed a win that, in the end, was almost comfortable.</p> <p>The poor Zimbabweans suffered a collapse that was beyond even England's wildest nightmares. Other Test teams, notably England at the same ground only six years ago, have been all out for less than 63. But the whole 20th century went by without a Test team falling short of a two-figure target. I had to Ask Steven when it last happened: he reckoned it was in 1882, at The Oval, when Australia set a target of 85, England were all out for 77, and the home supporters were so traumatised that a bunch of them got together to place a mock-obituary saying \"In affectionate remembrance of English cricket, which died at The Oval \u00c9\"</p> <p>The rest, of course, is history. And so is this. West Indies' obituary can now be put on hold - or rather hastily pulled from tomorrow's first editions. Their home record, which has remained excellent while their away form has gone to pieces, is not to be besmirched with a series defeat by the team ranked bottom in the Wisden World Championship. And Zimbabwe have not won their first Test in the Caribbean. More than that, they join the list of great sporting chokes, somewhere between Greg Norman and Bayern Munich. You have to feel for Andy Flower, who is lumbered with the triple burden that did for Alec Stewart - captain, wicketkeeper, and key batsman. In this match, helped by a poor umpiring decision and a few dropped catches, he was the only man to pass 50, and went on to a hundred. </p> <p>The only consolation for him is that South Africa did something similar in their only Test in the West Indies, in 1991-92. So did India four years ago (all out for 81), and so have England, at regular intervals. The Caribbean is still, after all these years of decline, a very hard place to win a Test match, and harder still if you are batting last, because the pitches are so uneven. Andy Flower's good fortune was cancelled out today by the fate of his brother Grant. He was the one man who could have won it, the only one, in 60-something overs, who managed a boundary. And he got a shocker of a shooter. For Port-of-Spain, read sport of pain.</p> <p>For Jimmy Adams, it was an astonishing start to his career as West Indies captain. Even Mike Brearley didn't conjure victories like this until his second stint in charge of England. Adams has embarked on probably the most difficult job in cricket at the trickiest time imaginable, and in the wrong place - Trinidad, where Brian Lara is king and no other current player is good enough to make the Test team. Adams is one of the brightest, most level-headed men in the game. Today, he needed to be. </p> <p>Tim de Lisle is editor of wisden.com and Wisden Cricket Monthly.

I had to Ask Steven when it last happened: he reckoned it was in 1882, at The Oval, when Australia set a target of 85, England were all out for 77, and the home supporters were so traumatised that a bunch of them got together to place a mock-obituary saying \"In affectionate remembrance of English cricket, which died at The Oval \u00c9\" The rest, of course, is history. And so is this. West Indies' obituary can now be put on hold - or rather hastily pulled from tomorrow's first editions. Their home record, which has remained excellent while their away form has gone to pieces, is not to be besmirched with a series defeat by the team ranked bottom in the Wisden World Championship. And Zimbabwe have not won their first Test in the Caribbean. More than that, they join the list of great sporting chokes, somewhere between Greg Norman and Bayern Munich. You have to feel for Andy Flower, who is lumbered with the triple burden that did for Alec Stewart - captain, wicketkeeper, and key batsman. In this match, helped by a poor umpiring decision and a few dropped catches, he was the only man to pass 50, and went on to a hundred. The only consolation for him is that South Africa did something similar in their only Test in the West Indies, in 1991-92. So did India four years ago (all out for 81), and so have England, at regular intervals. The Caribbean is still, after all these years of decline, a very hard place to win a Test match, and harder still if you are batting last, because the pitches are so uneven. Andy Flower's good fortune was cancelled out today by the fate of his brother Grant. He was the one man who could have won it, the only one, in 60-something overs, who managed a boundary. And he got a shocker of a shooter. For Port-of-Spain, read sport of pain. For Jimmy Adams, it was an astonishing start to his career as West Indies captain. Even Mike Brearley didn't conjure victories like this until his second stint in charge of England. Adams has embarked on probably the most difficult job in cricket at the trickiest time imaginable, and in the wrong place - Trinidad, where Brian Lara is king and no other current player is good enough to make the Test team. Adams is one of the brightest, most level-headed men in the game. Today, he needed to be. Tim de Lisle is editor of wisden.com and Wisden Cricket Monthly.

Gregory Philip Pailthorpe, an unemployed Sydney man with a history of mental illness, later appeared in court and was ordered to be held overnight for assessment in a psychiatric unit. His lawyer told Sydney's central local court that Mr Pailthorpe, 39, admitted having the knife but \"had the intention of protecting the Queen and not harming her in any way\". Detectives had earlier suspected that he had a home-made bomb in his rucksack, but forensic experts found later that a box containing wires and batteries was harmless. Australian government officials said that when challenged Mr Pailthorpe had said: \"Don't worry, I'm a member of the SAS.\" Although the pro-monarchists won November's vote by 54.22% to 44.87%, with majorities in favour of retaining the monarchy in all but one of Australia's six states, recent polls indicate that a majority of Australians now favour a homegrown head of state but they disagree about how to choose one. On this theory, the referendum only failed to produce a majority in favour of a republic because of the controversy surrounding the proposed new constitutional model.

Sources said that the chancellor and the education secretary, David Blunkett, had been so impressed by the instant impact of Emas in 15 pilot areas that they have fast-tracked plans to widen the scope of the experiment from the start of the next academic year. </p> <p>Early evidence from the pilots launched last September shows that the payments of up to \u00a340 a week for the poorest families have had a marked effect on the numbers staying on at school and that they could raise the national staying-on rate of 80% by up to 6 percentage points. </p> <p>In opposition, Labour floated the idea of abolishing child benefit for those over 16 who stay on at school and replacing it by means-tested Emas.

      "bodyText": "A major expansion of state payments of up to \u00a340 a week to encourage youngsters in Britain's run-down urban areas to stay on at school after the age of 16 will be announced by the chancellor in tomorrow's Budget. In a move certain to reopen the debate about the future of child benefit for 16 to 18-year-olds, Gordon Brown is to earmark tens of millions of pounds to increase the number of areas piloting educational maintenance allowances (Emas). With the chancellor putting the finishing touches to his fourth Budget, government sources yesterday shrugged off as \"total rubbish\" reports that he was at loggerheads with the prime minister over April's planned 1p cut in income tax. \"There has been no row about the basic rate of income tax,\" one Whitehall insider said, stressing that the government's priority was to increase the amount of money available to improve public services, particularly health and education, rather than a further reduction in the basic rate from 22%. In what is being billed as a tight package overall, Mr Brown is to target tax cuts selectively, with more generous tax breaks for the working poor and budding entrepreneurs high on his list of priorities. Sources said that the chancellor and the education secretary, David Blunkett, had been so impressed by the instant impact of Emas in 15 pilot areas that they have fast-tracked plans to widen the scope of the experiment from the start of the next academic year. Early evidence from the pilots launched last September shows that the payments of up to \u00a340 a week for the poorest families have had a marked effect on the numbers staying on at school and that they could raise the national staying-on rate of 80% by up to 6 percentage points. In opposition, Labour floated the idea of abolishing child benefit for those over 16 who stay on at school and replacing it by means-tested Emas. Fears that it would antagonise middle-class voters meant that the idea was put on ice before the election, with Labour's manifesto committing the party to a review of educational support for the over-16s. However, Mr Brown remains a keen supporter of the idea, believing that it would help to tackle educational underperformance in poor areas, where staying-on rates average only 35%. Government sources said last night that the future of child benefit was still an open question, but added that if Emas proved to be a success there would be renewed impetus for a radical overhaul of the current system. Mr Brown and Mr Blunkett are keen to see which form of Ema works best, since in some pilots the allowance is paid to the mother rather than the student. The speed at which the benefit is phased out and the cut-off point where families are no longer eligible also varies. The new pilots in September will test whether the payment of transport costs has any impact on staying-on rates. Mr Brown believes that the payments will have a marked impact on educational attainment, giving youngsters a better chance of escaping from poverty. With the Conservatives yesterday stepping up their recent attacks on the government's record on tax, sources said there was no split between the chancellor and the prime minister on whether government help should be focused on eradicating poverty or boosting health spending. The shadow chancellor, Michael Portillo, said the average working family was paying an extra \u00a3600 a year more in tax under Labour. Using figures prepared by the House of Commons library, Mr Portillo said that the average family was losing \u00a3400 a year on pension tax; \u00a3175 on petrol; \u00a3139 on tobacco; \u00a398.50 as a result of the abolition of the married couples tax allowance; and \u00a3100 resulting from council tax rises. \"Labour would like us to believe that they have only raised tax on fat cats and the super rich,\" Mr Portillo said. \"These figures show that it is actually ordinary hard-working families who are being hit.\" The chief secretary to the treasury, Andrew Smith, insisted that the tax burden on the average family was falling, adding that Mr Portillo was launching a \"desperate attempt\" to hide the fact that his policy of cutting tax while increasing public spending did not add up.

      "body": "<p>The fate of the Rover plant at Longbridge is a graphic illustration of one of the big dilemmas in a modern economy. For a government committed to high employment, plant closures are a potential disaster. But, for a government committed to high productivity, closing poorly performing plants is precisely what is required. How realistic is this dilemma and what should the government do about it? </p> <p>If the market worked well then poor firms would disappear. Unable to produce the goods that customers want, the exit of inefficient firms would raise the average productivity of those remaining. Well functioning markets give you a double whammy. Innovative new firms will enter and prosper, replacing the older ones, again raising the batting average. </p> <p>The market then does nothing more than boost the average of the side by leaving the poor performers out and bringing the good performers in. </p> <p>However, markets may not work as well as one would like. Speculation, short-termism, and imperfect information might all plague the smooth running of the market place. Firms might exit due to misjudgment, or be sunk by a bank's unreasonable speculative pessimism. Firms, saddled with debt having invested for the long term, might find themselves unable to continue in business. Maybe then governments should be intervening to keep even poorly performing plants alive. </p> <p>Part of the problem in the debate is the lack of hard evidence. Suppose plant closure contributed little to productivity growth. Then we should not worry too much about keeping such plants open for they would be sacrificing little on the target of raising productivity while perhaps gaining much on the target of raising employment. If governments knew how important plant closure was, they could understand the magnitudes of the trade-offs involved. </p> <p>In recent work, we have tried to answer exactly this question. Using data from the UK Census of Production, we have calculated the productivity of every manufacturing plant in Britain from 1980-1992. We calculated productivity as output per unit of input, where the inputs are the combined inputs of labour, capital, raw materials and intermediate goods. We then tracked plants through time and separated plants into those that survive, those that are new entrants and those that exit. Since this data has not been available to researchers before the results provide the first hard evidence on the role of plant closures. </p> <p>The figure summarises what we found. The survivors line shows their productivity grew steadily, while exiting plants had much lower productivity. The impact of the recession in the early 1980s is especially clear, where the line shows that particularly low productivity plants exited. The entrants line shows they were more productive (by about 4% on average) though in the early 1980s their productivity dipped below stayers for a couple of years. </p> <p>Since exiting plants are less productive than stayers, productivity growth is boosted by their departure. Since new plants are more productive than stayers, productivity growth is boosted by their entry. Some further calculations quantify the various effects. In British manufacturing, about 50% of productivity growth between 1980 and 1992 was due to the high productivity plants entering and low productivity plants exiting (the rest was due to existing plants growing). Furthermore, most of this entry and exit effect was due to the closure of poorly performing plants within larger firms, exactly the Rover story. </p> <p>Stopping closure would significantly sacrifice productivity by keeping low performing plants. So what is the answer? One option is to make subsidies to firms conditional on improving productivity. The problem with this is what to do when it does not work. </p> <p>A better option would be try to help the local economy adjust to closure by for example, supporting retraining, labour mobility and new business start-ups. Getting these policies right is hard. But spending large amounts of money trying to keep poor plants open will reduce productivity, and looks increasingly ineffective. The tides of global competition are too strong to order back. </p> <p>The Rover case also raises deeper questions. Perhaps the most profound change in the trend to a more global economy is the increased mobility of capital. Firms can now quite credibly threaten governments with moving plants overseas. By playing different countries off against each other, they can exact increasingly large subsidies. </p> <p>The flip side is that governments are tempted to lower taxes to induce firms to locate in their country. Such tax competition is an important issue in Europe with Ireland's low corporation taxes particularly successful in attracting inward investment and the wrath of fellow EU states. The outcome of such tax competition is that firms will not be taxed at all, leaving subsidies to be paid for by taxes on workers. Whether workers will be willing to withstand these burdens remains to be seen.</p>",

For a government committed to high employment, plant closures are a potential disaster. But, for a government committed to high productivity, closing poorly performing plants is precisely what is required. How realistic is this dilemma and what should the government do about it? If the market worked well then poor firms would disappear. Unable to produce the goods that customers want, the exit of inefficient firms would raise the average productivity of those remaining. Well functioning markets give you a double whammy. Innovative new firms will enter and prosper, replacing the older ones, again raising the batting average. The market then does nothing more than boost the average of the side by leaving the poor performers out and bringing the good performers in. However, markets may not work as well as one would like. Speculation, short-termism, and imperfect information might all plague the smooth running of the market place. Firms might exit due to misjudgment, or be sunk by a bank's unreasonable speculative pessimism. Firms, saddled with debt having invested for the long term, might find themselves unable to continue in business. Maybe then governments should be intervening to keep even poorly performing plants alive. Part of the problem in the debate is the lack of hard evidence. Suppose plant closure contributed little to productivity growth. Then we should not worry too much about keeping such plants open for they would be sacrificing little on the target of raising productivity while perhaps gaining much on the target of raising employment. If governments knew how important plant closure was, they could understand the magnitudes of the trade-offs involved. In recent work, we have tried to answer exactly this question. Using data from the UK Census of Production, we have calculated the productivity of every manufacturing plant in Britain from 1980-1992. We calculated productivity as output per unit of input, where the inputs are the combined inputs of labour, capital, raw materials and intermediate goods. We then tracked plants through time and separated plants into those that survive, those that are new entrants and those that exit. Since this data has not been available to researchers before the results provide the first hard evidence on the role of plant closures. The figure summarises what we found. The survivors line shows their productivity grew steadily, while exiting plants had much lower productivity. The impact of the recession in the early 1980s is especially clear, where the line shows that particularly low productivity plants exited. The entrants line shows they were more productive (by about 4% on average) though in the early 1980s their productivity dipped below stayers for a couple of years. Since exiting plants are less productive than stayers, productivity growth is boosted by their departure. Since new plants are more productive than stayers, productivity growth is boosted by their entry. Some further calculations quantify the various effects. In British manufacturing, about 50% of productivity growth between 1980 and 1992 was due to the high productivity plants entering and low productivity plants exiting (the rest was due to existing plants growing). Furthermore, most of this entry and exit effect was due to the closure of poorly performing plants within larger firms, exactly the Rover story. Stopping closure would significantly sacrifice productivity by keeping low performing plants. So what is the answer? One option is to make subsidies to firms conditional on improving productivity. The problem with this is what to do when it does not work. A better option would be try to help the local economy adjust to closure by for example, supporting retraining, labour mobility and new business start-ups. Getting these policies right is hard. But spending large amounts of money trying to keep poor plants open will reduce productivity, and looks increasingly ineffective. The tides of global competition are too strong to order back. The Rover case also raises deeper questions. Perhaps the most profound change in the trend to a more global economy is the increased mobility of capital. Firms can now quite credibly threaten governments with moving plants overseas. By playing different countries off against each other, they can exact increasingly large subsidies. The flip side is that governments are tempted to lower taxes to induce firms to locate in their country. Such tax competition is an important issue in Europe with Ireland's low corporation taxes particularly successful in attracting inward investment and the wrath of fellow EU states. The outcome of such tax competition is that firms will not be taxed at all, leaving subsidies to be paid for by taxes on workers. Whether workers will be willing to withstand these burdens remains to be seen.",

Taiwanese voters defied Chinese warnings on Saturday by narrowly electing Chen Shui-bian, candidate for the pro-independence Democratic Progressive party (DPP), with 39.3% of the vote. The headquarters of the Kuomintang (KMT) came under siege by hundreds of party members who claimed that the outgoing president, Lee Teng-hui, had conspired to ensure victory for Mr Chen. Demonstrators hurled eggs and stones and shifted barbed wire barricades to block riot police and water cannons. \"Lee has plotted to destroy us,\" shouted one demonstrator. \"We are so angry with this pig, we have fury in our hearts. Lee must resign as party chairman!\" Last night Mr Lee was still refusing to step down immediately. However, pressure grew on him after a party spokesman, Huang Huei-chen, said Mr Lee would hand over in September and the mayor of Taipei, Ma Ying-jeou, told demonstrators he would urge him to go now. Mr Lee has gone further than any other KMT leader in saying that Taiwan is a separate state from China. The demonstrators accuse him of lukewarm support for Lien Chan, the KMT candidate who came third with only 23.1%. KMT members claim Mr Lee deliberately split it by ousting James Soong, a former party leader who ran a close second to Mr Chen, winning 36.8%. Mr Soong stands to profit from the KMT's collapse and has indicated that he may form a new party. Fears of military action eased after Beijing made it clear that it will wait at least until after Mr Chen and the new vice-president, the veteran feminist Annette Lu, are inaugurated in May. A statement said: \"We should listen to what the new leader in Taiwan says and watch what he does. We will observe where he will lead cross-straits relations.\" But Beijing also publicised a mainland poll which allegedly showed that 95% of the people \"will shed blood for their country if the Taiwan leader wants to secede\". In his acceptance speech on Saturday night, Mr Chen said that he would defend Taiwan's \"sovereignty\", but avoided using the more provocative word, \"independence.\" He repeated his offer to visit Beijing before the inauguration: \"We would like to immediately negotiate with China on the issues of direct transport links, direct commerce, investment and military confidence-building measures\".

The immigration minister, Barbara Roche, is considering the scheme as one way of relieving the increasing pressure that the government faces over the asylum issue. It comes in the face of warnings from Labour's polling guru, Philip Gould, of focus group evidence showing that asylum lies only just behind the state of the health service and education in the list of issues that are damaging the government's standing in the country. The asylum system is beginning to recover from a complete breakdown in the past year. More than 8,000 decisions were made in the last four weeks and for the first time since 1996 outstripped the number of applications during the same period. Ministers are hoping to maintain this performance and begin to eat away at the backlog of more than 102,000 cases awaiting a decision. The current average waiting time to determine whether an asylum claim that has not been fast-tracked is genuine or not is 13 months. In an attempt to restore public faith in this ramshackle system for dealing with asylum applications, the first privately run \"internment\" camp will open at Oakington, near Cambridge, today with the aim of deciding initial applications from 13,000 asylum seekers within seven days and so saving \u00a330m a year in costs of housing and education. Men and women arriving at the Group 4-run \"processing centre\" housed in a former RAF base will be separated and families broken up while their applications are considered. Those whose applications are turned down will have three weeks to appeal before facing removal from the country. The decision of ministers to use a fast-track system for those convicted of begging as well as those suspected of making abusive claims indicates that Labour is deter mined that its asylum reforms, including a system of vouchers and dispersal, are seen as an effective deterrent abroad to those thinking of coming to Britain and to answer claims that the country is a \"soft touch\" compared with other European destinations. It is already a criminal offence to beg on the streets in Britain and it is expected that an immigration and asylum appeal tribunal would be unlikely to look sympathetically at the claim for refugee status from a woman who had been convicted of a criminal offence while she was here. A Home Office spokesman said yesterday: \"There is absolutely no reason for any asylum seeker to be begging on the streets, they are provided with enough to live on. The Home Office is looking at ways of addressing what appears to be increasing numbers of asylum seekers who are begging.

He went to a foster family but was moved after an army cadet made allegations of sexual assault at a training camp against the foster father.</p> <p>S stayed with other foster families before asking to be moved to a children's home because he couldn't cope with being in a family. When he came out of care, he moved from place to place, never finding a proper job but supporting himself by stealing. He took an overdose of paracetamol and spent time in young offender institutions for stealing.</p> <p>Eventually he disclosed that his foster father, who was convicted of sexual assaults on other children, had frequently buggered him. A psychiatrist said he showed typical features of post-traumatic stress disorder.</p> <p>L's childhood and teenage years were just as grossly disturbed. When she was four, her parents put her and her younger brother into care. Her parents told social services they were freelance photographers who had to go to the Caribbean to produce a book. For nearly two years, the children lived with foster parents. Soon after she was reunited with her parents, L disclosed that her foster father had sexually abused her. Years later he was convicted of sexual assaults on a number of children, including L, and sentenced to 10 years in prison. A psychiatrist who saw L at 21 found evidence of a personality disorder throughout her teens with multiple pregnancies, truanting, shoplifting, fraud and a suicide attempt. She failed at school and had a poor work record.</p> <p>S and L were both awarded compensation by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority, the state body which compensates victims of violent crime. But in each case the award was reduced - because of their own criminal records. The assaults on S were judged to be worth \u00a312,000, but the award was reduced to \u00a39,000. L received \u00a37,500.</p> <p>Yet surely their offending is part of the whole picture of disturbed behaviour, just as much as the suicide attempts and truanting. Many of the survivors of sex abuse at children's homes in North Wales and elsewhere have criminal records.</p> <p>Not all the after-effects, including criminal behaviour, can be blamed entirely on the abuse: many children who go into care have suffered harm from poor parenting in their early years. But the abuse is likely to have damaged further their chances of becoming functioning adults, as the criminal injuries scheme recognises. Why penalise them twice?</p> <p>Even more unfairly, the scheme refuses to award compensation for sex assaults on youngsters below the age of consent who appear to have participated willingly. If the child did not resist, the reasoning goes, the crime is not violent and therefore not covered by the scheme.</p> <p>Last week the High Court rejected a challenge to the authority's refusal to compensate a girl who, aged 12, was plied with drink and induced to have sex with an adult in a wood. He was convicted of unlawful sexual intercourse but she was refused compensation because the authority decided it was not a crime of violence. This interpretation is now to be challenged in the Appeal Court by Carl August, who was buggered by a 53-year-old when he was a 13-year-old rent boy. His lawyers argue that since a 13-year-old's consent is not a defence to a charge of buggery, he should not be held to have consented.</p> <p>They also contend that he was unable to give a valid consent anyway: a psychiatrist's report at the time describes him as a \"grossly psychologically disturbed and damaged 13-year-old boy, living in the care system, who was incapable of giving consent.\" Too many children who go into the care system end up as victims of abuse. The crime compensation scheme should not turn them into double victims.</p>",

For nearly two years, the children lived with foster parents. Soon after she was reunited with her parents, L disclosed that her foster father had sexually abused her. Years later he was convicted of sexual assaults on a number of children, including L, and sentenced to 10 years in prison. A psychiatrist who saw L at 21 found evidence of a personality disorder throughout her teens with multiple pregnancies, truanting, shoplifting, fraud and a suicide attempt. She failed at school and had a poor work record. S and L were both awarded compensation by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority, the state body which compensates victims of violent crime. But in each case the award was reduced - because of their own criminal records. The assaults on S were judged to be worth \u00a312,000, but the award was reduced to \u00a39,000. L received \u00a37,500. Yet surely their offending is part of the whole picture of disturbed behaviour, just as much as the suicide attempts and truanting. Many of the survivors of sex abuse at children's homes in North Wales and elsewhere have criminal records. Not all the after-effects, including criminal behaviour, can be blamed entirely on the abuse: many children who go into care have suffered harm from poor parenting in their early years. But the abuse is likely to have damaged further their chances of becoming functioning adults, as the criminal injuries scheme recognises. Why penalise them twice? Even more unfairly, the scheme refuses to award compensation for sex assaults on youngsters below the age of consent who appear to have participated willingly. If the child did not resist, the reasoning goes, the crime is not violent and therefore not covered by the scheme. Last week the High Court rejected a challenge to the authority's refusal to compensate a girl who, aged 12, was plied with drink and induced to have sex with an adult in a wood. He was convicted of unlawful sexual intercourse but she was refused compensation because the authority decided it was not a crime of violence. This interpretation is now to be challenged in the Appeal Court by Carl August, who was buggered by a 53-year-old when he was a 13-year-old rent boy. His lawyers argue that since a 13-year-old's consent is not a defence to a charge of buggery, he should not be held to have consented. They also contend that he was unable to give a valid consent anyway: a psychiatrist's report at the time describes him as a \"grossly psychologically disturbed and damaged 13-year-old boy, living in the care system, who was incapable of giving consent.\" Too many children who go into the care system end up as victims of abuse. The crime compensation scheme should not turn them into double victims.",

There are very few regulations and you can do what you want. \"When we were getting on the plane to come home, I had tears in my eyes and a lump in my throat. There are great opportunities out there.\" Mr Sykes took over the farm from his father in 1983 and until 1996 made a decent profit. \"Since then, everything has gone down hill. Britain doesn't want farmers any more. This government would rather import food than have farmers produce it here.\" And then there's the weather: \"You get summer and winter there. Here we get only wind and rain.\" Sybil and Stephen Soulsby, both in their mid-30s, and their 16-month-old daughter Helen left their 500 acres near Carlisle in February for 2,000 acres at Virden in south-west Manitoba. \"So far things have been good and we've found some excellent neighbours,\" said Mrs Soulsby. \"And I have a jacuzzi and hardwood floors so I'm not complaining one bit. \"We hope that the harder we work, the more our account will stay in the black. In Britain, we were working all the hours God gave but were facing more and more regulation and losing more and more money.\" The Soulsbys heard talks from Mr Torr and other agents but also researched their move on the internet and in libraries before taking the plunge. \"We obviously miss everyone but our friends have been very supportive - they think of us as a new holiday destination.\"",

Two days after the Guardian failed to carry a news report of the Newcastle march it published a front page story by Peter Hetherington titled Hunt job losses claims are rebutted. \"This news story,\" said Mr Mitchell, \"lacked proper journalistic objectivity and was presented without sufficient scrutiny, with the result that some readers may have been misled.\" The response to his initial complaint was \"more of a dismissal than an explanation, being unduly defensive and somewhat hostile\". </p> <p>Ignoring the demonstration and publishing an anti-hunting story within two days, said Mr Mitchell, \"raises questions about the paper's reputation for straight reporting.\" </p> <p> <b> Findings</b> </p> <p> The decision not to publish the story of the demonstration was a matter of news judgment. It was the largest ever protest in Newcastle, on the other hand on a national scale bigger protests have not been reported by the Guardian and other newspapers.

Mr Mitchell states that (a) Dr Ward's report was not new and (b) Dr Ward has associations with a relevant pressure group and close links with the Labour party. </p> <p>Mr Mitchell is right in saying that the report was first published in March 1998, not September 1999, and that some work on the figures had previously been undertaken by Dr Ward for a television programme in 1997. </p> <p>However, the September publication was the first time that publication had been peer reviewed, giving the study additional credibility, before publication in the Journal of Rural Studies. </p> <p>Dr Ward says that he did some additional work on the study before academic scrutiny and that it could legitimately be regarded as new. </p> <p>Whether the Guardian was justified in using the word \"today\" in Peter Hetherington's report of October 20 is a moot point. In my view, they were not. This may have given the article a sense of up-to-the-minute topicality. However, it did not diminish the basic value or integrity of the information in the paper's report. </p> <p>The report by Dr Ward, on behalf of Newcastle University, was partly funded by the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW), the anti-hunting group. This was not mentioned in the original Guardian report. </p> <p>However, Dr Ward's study has been reviewed by his academic peers and he is clear that funding sources had no impact upon the figures contained in the report. Indeed, he is unhappy about Mr Mitchell's attack on his integrity and independence as an academic. </p> <p>Dr Ward has confirmed that he was not a member of the Labour party or any other political party and that his period in the Cabinet Office was as a civil servant, not as a political appointee. </p> <p>Mr Mitchell also alleges that the RSPCA, which is opposed to hunting, \"cleared\" the use of this data with Dr Ward. Dr Ward says he in fact rang the RSPCA to complain about its behaviour. </p> <p>Ideally, the Guardian should not have used the word \"today\" and also referred to the partial funding source of Dr Ward's study. However, those two minor points do not impinge upon the basic accuracy of Dr Ward's figures, nor amount to \"distorted\" news reporting. </p> <p>On November 18, a month after the Newcastle march, Peter Hetherington wrote a balanced analysis article which carefully gave space to both sides of the debate, including the impact on rural jobs. </p> <p>Mr Mitchell complains that the Guardian's response to his complaint was a disgrace.

      "bodyText": "The Metropolitan police's secretive anti-corruption squad has dropped one of its top supergrasses after two years. The surprise move means the supergrass, the convicted former Met detective, Terry McGuinness, will now be sentenced for his own corrupt activities spanning six years. The decision last week that Mr McGuinness is no longer considered a reliable witness against serving and former officers is an embarrassment for the Met's much-vaunted drive to root out bent coppers. The complaints investigation branch (CIB3) hoped Mr McGuinness's evidence against his flying squad colleagues would bolster its faltering anti-corruption drive which has so far secured only seven convictions for major corruption in six years. Earlier this month a Guardian investigation revealed that CIB3, dubbed the untouchables, was using discredited practices and is now the subject of three internal inquiries. Of great concern is the return of the controversial supergrass system where corrupt officers and criminals are offered inducements such as a reduction in sentence to be served in a safe house, a new identity and financial assistance when freed, to turn Queen's evidence and implicate others in return. The loss of Mr McGuinness means CIB3 is now relying on two main supergrasses to underpin the anti-corruption drive. Mr McGuiness, 41, has spent 27 months as a CIB3 supergrass with special privileges. Most of this time will be taken off the heavily reduced sentence he is likely to receive at the Old Bailey in 10 days' time. He will earn two thirds off his sentence for pleading guilty in September, 1998, to seven counts of corruption, including conspiracy to steal and perverting the course of justice. Mr McGuinness served at the Rigg Approach flying squad office in east London from 1990 to 1997. He cultivated senior officers and before joining the flying squad served with detectives who are now in senior positions at CIB3. According to a former CIB3 officer, Mr McGuinness and a fellow officer, Detective Constable Kevin Garner, were put under surveillance in 1995 following a tip-off from an informant inside the Met. Both officers were finally arrested during a CIB3 drugs sting in December, 1997. They were secretly videoed stealing \u00a3500,000 of cannabis placed by CIB3 officers in an east London flat. McGuinness and Mr Garner decided to \"roll over\", and became CIB3's first and most important supergrasses. They made self-incriminating allegations against more than 80 officers for various crimes, including the theft of recovered proceeds from a \u00a3300,000 robbery. CIB3 mounted a huge clandestine operation codenamed Ethiopia and suspended a large number of detectives. But last year the crown prosecution service decided not to proceeded against them, thereby raising the first serious doubts about the value of Mr McGuiness and Mr Garner as witnesses. A defence solicitor in a big CIB3 corruption case said: \"The supergrass-informant system is completely flawed. The police try to clean up people who are mainly criminals and dishonest by presenting them as witnesses of truth in return for large sentence reductions and time in a safe house not prison. \"The lesson is if you are going to commit offences do so on a large scale otherwise you are not in a position to trade when you are caught. That is unacceptable.\" The third CIB3 supergrass is an even more controversial figure than the two flying squad officers. Hector Harvey is a professional criminal linked to various organised crime groups in London. Commander Andy Hayman, the CIB3 commander, told the Guardian that Mr Harvey was assisting in forthcoming trials against Rigg officers, adding that he had pleaded guilty to 85 counts of armed robbery and related offences. But Mr Hayman will not disclose how many of these robberies were committed while Mr Harvey was a protected witness living in a safe house under a new identity provided by the Met. The figure is believed to be about 30. CIB Chief Superintendent David Wood said there had been no investigation into the handling of Harvey and he described him as a reliable witness of truth who had been \"cleansed of his criminality\".",

Around 3,000 runners will arrive in Morocco next month to take part in the Marathon des Sables, or sands marathon, which has become the ultimate challenge for endurance sports enthusiasts. For the first time, an all British women's team is set to take part in the mega-marathon, which lasts six days and involves tackling desert mountains, giant sand dunes and stony plateaux. The entire course is almost 150 miles long and some stages of the race involve running the equivalent of two marathons in one day in temperatures topping 38C (100F). Britain's first women's team is made up of soldiers Kathryn Macphee, Katie Unsworth and Tessa Loyd who are all lieutenants in the Royal Engineers. They have spent three months undergoing rigorous training that included 30-mile runs each day, often wearing woolly hats and thermal underwear so that they could become accustomed to sweating profusely. The training schedule involved taking running machines into heat chambers and endurance training in Wales, where they ran daily marathons across giant sand dunes to familiarise themselves with the Sahara's terrain. \"We are in good physical shape but are getting quite nervous,\" said Lt Macphee. \"No amount of preparation in Britain can prepare us for the types of temperatures we are about to face.\" The Marathon des Sables, which is now in its 15th year, begins on April 9 and com petitors from 30 countries will take part.

Parents devote an average of 85 minutes a day to each child compared with 25 minutes a day in the mid-1970s. By 2010, the figure is predicted to leap to 100 minutes, destroying the myth that family life is being damaged as both parents go out to work. Researchers questioned three generations of families on their attitudes to parenting. When asked to compare their practices with what their parents did, the majority of men and women said they took parenting more seriously. In every key aspect of parenting and family life explored by researchers, fewer than one in 10 respondents spent less time with their children than their parents did. Two-thirds of parents claimed they spent more time every day reading with or helping their children with homework. Full-time working parents were found to spend more time than their part-time and non-working counterparts talking to their children and enjoying leisure activities. The study - by the Future Foundation - also showed that men were now more involved in their children's lives.",

Patricia Greed, 49, contracted the virus from a blood transfusion almost 20 years ago, years before hepatitis C in blood supplies was identified as a health risk. Avon health authority, which has accepted responsibility for her illness, says it cannot afford the \u00a34,300 cost of the treatment needed to save her. But without drug therapy to protect her liver from further damage she risks developing liver cancer, which would make a transplant her only hope of survival. Mrs Greed, of Worle, near Weston-super-Mare in Somerset, cannot afford to pay for the treatment and has launched a fund-raising effort to save her own life. If she lived five miles further south in the Somerset health area she would eligible for free treatment. Her case is the latest to highlight the problem of the \"postcode lottery of care\", which critics claim is failing patients with serious illnesses because costly drugs are prescribed according to where they live instead of on the basis of clinical need. Mrs Greed said yesterday: \"It makes me so angry. Avon has given me this condition and they are now refusing to treat me. \"I would not be in this situation if it wasn't for them. \"I find it hard to believe they can put a price on my life and that I'm not even worth \u00a34,000.

The authority is one of only three in the country that does not provide the treatment. More than 600,000 people in Britain are estimated to be infected with hepatitis C, commonly as a result of intravenous drug use with dirty needles.

      "body": "<p>On Shepherd's Bush Green in London, I once saw a previously well-known broadcaster trudging stubbled and bleary within a few hundred yards of the BBC studios at which he was now unemployable. His supermarket bags, from their tinkling sound, seemed to contain only bottles. His mistake had been to make a series of remarks judged tasteless by churchmen and politicians. He was also difficult, and a drinker even then, but his downfall was his failure to mind his mouth. </p> <p>It was hard not to think of that victim of the airwave vigilantes while watching Jam (Thursday, 10.30pm, Channel 4), a new Chris Morris series which proves by its very existence how much more forgiving broadcasting is now. When Morris last had a show on the channel - Brass Eye - he brilliantly humiliated politicians and other public figures by tricking them into condemning an invented drug called \"cake\". Angered by Michael Grade's decision to postpone and cut the show, he secreted a subliminal obscene message about the then Channel 4 chief executive within the final tape. </p> <p>Grade later said he would never employ Morris again. Even the comedian's admirers within the industry feared that interference with transmission copy was the final taboo. But living in a culture which no longer believes in consequences brings both good and bad luck. The downside is that we get Jonathan Aitken publicising his memoirs. The upside is that Chris Morris gets a new series rather than ending up on Shepherd's Bush Green with clinking bags. His return also symbolically marks the moment at which Channel 4 ceases to be Grade's and becomes his successor Michael Jackson's. </p> <p>Morris's career as the magus of bad taste - he recently extended his taboo-busting to newspapers with Time To Go, an Observer spoof of terminal-illness journalism - devel oped in three phases. Radio series On The Hour and its television descendant The Day Today were elegantly rude about the solemn conventions of news broadcasting. The main joke was nonsensical sentences spoken with sinister authority by Morris's Paxmanesque anchorman. </p> <p>Brass Eye - the show which would make him unemployable in Grade's eyes - again mocked broadcasting, although the satire was more pro-active, tricking celebrities into co-operating with the joke against them. Sending up television and setting up star stunts are now the default mode for graduate gagsters, but in Morris's most recent series he develops a tone we haven't seen before. </p> <p>Channel 4's Jam - like Radio 1's Blue Jam, Morris's earlier laboratory version - runs surreal sketches against a techno soundtrack. Broadcasting - described by its pioneers as a \"friend in the corner of the room\" - usually reassures. It's a rule of producers (ever more so as the expansion in channels raises fears about losing viewers) that audiences should \"know where they are\". Jam extravagantly tears up the map, deliberately leaving you stranded, unnerved and unsure. </p> <p>The subversion begins with a kind of sub-verse, as Morris recites, over footage of a nightclub dancer, a bleak tone poem about \"jazzing to the tone of a life-support machine that marks the steady fading of your day-old baby daughter\". And there's an Ortonesque sketch in which a middle-class couple try to employ a family friend as a sexual surrogate, conducting gay relations with the patriarch to leave the matriarch free to sleep with her son. </p> <p>As in much of Morris's work, the joke is usually the gap between tone and content. The articulate middle-class witness beloved of news programmes describes, with characteristic precision, a suicide attempt at a block of flats. It soon becomes clear that the residents are helping the man to kill himself. A singer stretched across a tree-trunk croons Minnie Ripperton's Loving You, but the camera pulls back to show a semi-naked man flagellating her with a Space Hopper. </p> <p>Apart from television, the most frequent target for Morris (who won't give interviews) is the medical profession. The Radio 1 shows included a doctor who seriously believed he could kiss it better, and Jam features a hospital consultant who diagnoses the \"symptomless coma\" and ends the lives of numerous healthy patients. </p> <p>The point has sometimes been made - most forcibly against Emma Thompson's 80s TV sketch show which forced her to seek an alternative career in the movies - that surrealism can be an excuse for not bothering with structure or punchlines, sweat-work of the best comedy. Morris generally avoids this objection because his pieces don't feel aimless. The aim is to unsettle and trouble. </p> <p>The taste-testing which made Morris's name and led him to take Grade's in vain is less in evidence than elsewhere, although you suspect that Channel 4's Right To Reply may be hearing about a scene in which a husband accused by his wife of having an affair is bizarrely forgiven when he reveals that the infidelity was rape. </p> <p>The preview cassette, however, contained one black screen marked \"Scene Missing\". Michael Jackson may yet find himself having to decide whether to publish or be subliminally insulted.</p>",

It's a rule of producers (ever more so as the expansion in channels raises fears about losing viewers) that audiences should \"know where they are\". Jam extravagantly tears up the map, deliberately leaving you stranded, unnerved and unsure. The subversion begins with a kind of sub-verse, as Morris recites, over footage of a nightclub dancer, a bleak tone poem about \"jazzing to the tone of a life-support machine that marks the steady fading of your day-old baby daughter\". And there's an Ortonesque sketch in which a middle-class couple try to employ a family friend as a sexual surrogate, conducting gay relations with the patriarch to leave the matriarch free to sleep with her son. As in much of Morris's work, the joke is usually the gap between tone and content. The articulate middle-class witness beloved of news programmes describes, with characteristic precision, a suicide attempt at a block of flats. It soon becomes clear that the residents are helping the man to kill himself. A singer stretched across a tree-trunk croons Minnie Ripperton's Loving You, but the camera pulls back to show a semi-naked man flagellating her with a Space Hopper. Apart from television, the most frequent target for Morris (who won't give interviews) is the medical profession. The Radio 1 shows included a doctor who seriously believed he could kiss it better, and Jam features a hospital consultant who diagnoses the \"symptomless coma\" and ends the lives of numerous healthy patients. The point has sometimes been made - most forcibly against Emma Thompson's 80s TV sketch show which forced her to seek an alternative career in the movies - that surrealism can be an excuse for not bothering with structure or punchlines, sweat-work of the best comedy. Morris generally avoids this objection because his pieces don't feel aimless. The aim is to unsettle and trouble. The taste-testing which made Morris's name and led him to take Grade's in vain is less in evidence than elsewhere, although you suspect that Channel 4's Right To Reply may be hearing about a scene in which a husband accused by his wife of having an affair is bizarrely forgiven when he reveals that the infidelity was rape. The preview cassette, however, contained one black screen marked \"Scene Missing\". Michael Jackson may yet find himself having to decide whether to publish or be subliminally insulted.",

Still fighting off the doe-eyed, dappy cow legacy of her stint as Corrie's Raquel, Ms Lancashire grappled with the role of 70s actress Coral Atkins, who chucked in stardom to run her own children's home.

      "bodyText": "Charles Kennedy yesterday warned Tony Blair that his party will abandon Lib-Lab cooperation without a commitment to a referendum on voting reform as he sought to stake out distinctive Liberal Democrat electoral ground as the party of the environment. The Liberal Democrat leader made clear he is ready to cool formal links with Labour, leaving Mr Blair to decide on cooperation. The prime minister is preparing for a struggle with dissenters in his own party over support for proportional representation (PR). After telling delegates at his party's spring conference in Plymouth that the Lib-Lab joint cabinet committee (JCC) set up after the last election is \"by no means the be all and end all of influencing government\", Mr Kennedy yesterday warned on BBC1's Breakfast with Frost that, without a firm Labour manifesto commitment to hold a referendum on PR for Westminster, he could not see \"much basis for further meaningful cooperation\" between the two parties. The JCC, which discussed devolution and Lords reform, is now scheduled to examine only electoral changes such as weekend polls and reform of the United Nations. The threat to break off links comes as Mr Kennedy is seeking to counter accusations that he is failing to make a distinctive mark, six months after taking over leadership of his party from Paddy Ashdown. He acknowledged yesterday that he had failed to make an impact with 59% of voters according to a recent poll but insisted that he could develop the positive ratings he scored with those who did recognise him. Liberal Democrat strategists point to yesterday's conference speech - which broke with tradition by focusing primarily on the single policy theme of green issues - as defining a stronger political identity for both the party and its leader. In a 25 minute speech Mr Kennedy branded the government's record on the environment \"absolutely pathetic\", telling delegates \"there is no joined up thinking on the environment\". Accepting that he and his own party had \"ducked some tough questions\" on the environment, Mr Kennedy urged a five year moratorium on the commercial growth of GM crops, and ridiculed the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, for failing to push through green transport measures. \"I want our party to turn the phrase 'on your bike' into a compliment,\" he said. Mr Kennedy's team hopes the well-received speech will provide its leader with a distinctive \"cause\" in the way Mr Ashdown made international conflicts, particularly the war in the Balkans, his special subject. The emphasis on the environment is intended to extend well beyond doorstop recycling schemes, attempting to link in social justice issues and core Liberal Democratic themes of freedom and liberty. Poorly insulated homes led to needless deaths among the elderly, while inner-city pollution denied children health and freedom, Mr Kennedy argued. \"Protecting the environment is the most fundamental liberation politics\" he told delegates, adding \"it is vital that we start persuading the British people that the environment is one of the biggest issues in politics\". Nevertheless it was for his assaults on the chancellor, Gordon Brown, for failing adequately to fund health and education that he received his warmest applause. Mr Kennedy now faces the difficult task of developing a genuinely populist green agenda and carving out an identity distinct from Labour's while also quelling the fears of some in his party that he is allowing Lib-Lab relations to cool too far. Some senior figures, including those close to Mr Ashdown, are concerned that Mr Kennedy is \"too passive\" in relations with Mr Blair, and appears to be too ready to \"park\" the joint committee in favour of bilateral talks on single issues such as freedom of information. Mr Ashdown is understood to want to see Mr Kennedy abandon talk of taking the Tories' place as the main party of opposition and concentrate on developing a half-dozen distinctive policies which would form the basis of negotiations in the event of a post-election Lib-Lab coalition.",

      "bodyText": "Senior ministers are to be summoned to a crisis meeting over Whitehall's heavy-handed attacks on the media for reporting allegations made by the former MI5 officer, David Shayler. The move follows a bitter dispute at the highest levels of government over attempts by the Home Office to force the Guardian and Observer newspapers to hand over any documents they may have relating to Mr Shayler. Robin Cook, the foreign secretary, and Peter Hain, the foreign office minister, are furious at what they believe to be a serious attack on press freedom. Mr Hain is said to be \"horrified\" about the actions by the Home Office, prompted by increasingly desperate attempts by the security and intelligence services to isolate Mr Shayler and prevent further al legations about wrongdoing being disclosed. An Old Bailey judge on Friday ordered the two newspapers to hand over to the police special branch any document or emails relating to Mr Shayler, and in particular his allegation that MI6 was involved in a plot to assassinate the Libyan leader, Colonel Gadafy, in 1996. Judge Martin Stephens made the order even though he admitted that a letter to the Guardian - the object of the order - contained nothing that had not already been printed. He ordered the Observer to give up material even though he acknowledged that Mr Shayler had already sent the same information to Jack Straw, the home secretary. The newspapers are challenging the orders and intend, if necessary, to take the case all the way to the European court of human rights. Evidence of MI6's involvement appeared in a top secret report placed on the internet last month. Sir Malcolm Rifkind, foreign secretary at the time, is understood to have insisted he knew nothing about MI6's involvement in the Gadafy plot. Mr Cook, who described the allegations as \"pure fantasy\" is believed to be less than happy about assurances he was given by MI6 which allowed him to dismiss them in this way. However opposed they are to leaks from MI5 and MI6, the foreign secretary and Mr Hain strongly believe that the problem will not go away - indeed, will be exacerbated - by the Home Office picking a war with the press. The court action has served to provoke further media interest in Mr Shayler's allegations. One Sunday newspaper yesterday repeated his earlier allegation that the IRA was able to carry out two mainland bombings because of a breakdown in communications between MI5 and the police special branch. MI6 will be further annoyed by a book on its activities to be published later this month. MI6, Fifty Years of Special Operations, names intelligence officers - including some still serving - whose names have appeared on the internet. Meanwhile the government wants to prosecute a former member of the army's force research unit - a covert arm of military intelligence - who has made allegations about attempts to sabotage an inquiry by Sir John Stevens, the metropolitan police commissioner, into collaboration between the army and loyalists in Northern Ireland. Geoffrey Hoon, the defence secretary, has obtained an in junction preventing newspapers from reporting further revelations by Martin Ingram. Sir John was reported yesterday to have ordered an investigation into allegations that the unit burgled and burnt down his offices to destroy incriminating evidence. John Wadham, Mr Ingram's solicitor, said yesterday: \"Once the authorities take the law into their own hands, they undermine the very democracy they purport to be protecting.\" Jane Winter, director of British Irish Rights Watch, said that if the allegation were true \"then that is more reminiscent of a banana republic than a civilised democracy\". Sir John is also heading an investigation into the murder of Pat Finucane, a Belfast lawyer murdered by loyalists in 1989.",

The Manchester Guardian editorialised that the bombing was legitimate, but that humanity had turned one of history's corners.

      "bodyText": "The attempted assassination of a key Iranian reformer has prompted an explosive debate over whether violence is justified in Islam if the faith is perceived to be under threat. Saeed Hajjarian, the architect of the reformers' victory in last month's parliamentary polls, was gunned down on March 12. The assailants are suspected of carrying out a hardline plot to extinguish political and social reform. Reformers and moderate clerics blame Ayatollah Mohammad Taqi Mesbah-Yazdi and like-minded theologians for encouraging extremists within the intelligence service, the Islamic basij militia, and the Revolutionary Guards for the attempted assassination and recent violence. Mr Hajjarian is now clinging to life in a Tehran hospital, where he underwent surgery yesterday for the first time since the shooting, doctors said, to enable him to eat normally. Many Iranians are demanding that the spiritual messengers behind the shooting be silenced. \"When the Friday prayers are used officially to advocate violence and justify it, and state television broadcasts these sermons, then this is the official position of the state,\" said Akbar Ganji, a journalist and leading intellectual. \"When it is said by officials that there will be a crisis in the country as long as Hajjarian lives, do you not expect them to assassinate him?\" Mr Ganji added. Ayatollah Mesbah-Yazdi, the leading ideologue of the right, routinely encourages violence from his pulpit and in lectures to religious students in the Shi'ite holy city of Qom. \"I am not a theoretician of violence, but I emphasise that in cases in which things go out of the government's control, and Islam is jeopardised, there is no way but using violence. Applying violence in these cases is a necessity,\" he told students a few months ago. In the parliamentary election on February 18, fewer clerics than ever before were elected MPs, but the roots of the latest war of words lie with the 1997 election campaign of President Mohammad Khatami, a moderate, mid-ranking cleric. His landslide victory strengthened the hands of progressive theologians and forced divisions within the clerical elite into the political realm. Mr Khatami's power enabled reformist theologians and Iranian society to openly challenge the hardline clerical establishment, which insists on imposing its views on how Islam should be applied in Iran. This fundamental dispute has surfaced in periodic eruptions of political violence, including a raid on the dormitories of pro-democracy students last July, and the murders in 1998 of dissident intellectuals by rogue agents in the intelligence service. The use of violence to defend Islam has long been debated, but the shooting of Mr Hajjarian has polarised Iranian society. \"How do you justify these terrorist activities?\" asked pro-reform Ayatollah Abdolkarim Moussavi-Ardebili during a lecture to religious students in Qom last week. \"Not one drop of Muslim blood must be shed. It is against the sharia (Islamic law).\"",

Joseph Palczynski, 31, has been holding captive his former girlfriend's mother, her mother's partner and the partner's 12-year-old son since Friday night, when he forced his way into their home in Dundalk, near Baltimore, Maryland. Mr Palczynski is suspected of killing four people in two shooting sprees which took place earlier this month after his girlfriend, Tracy Whitehead, left their shared home. Mr Palczynski was believed to have fired between five and 15 bullets in the direction of the police officers surrounding the house yesterday morning. No one was injured by the burst of gunfire, apparently intended to make police, who have sealed off the area, fall back, which they did. People living near the scene of the siege were being told to stay indoors yesterday while residents away when the siege began were not allowed to return to their homes. The gunfire came amid concerns that Mr Palczynski, who is believed to be a manic depressive, is becoming increasingly dangerous. He is understood to have armed himself with two high-powered rifles and a handgun. Ms Whitehead, who is 22, accused Mr Palczynski of trying to kill her before she moved out of their Maryland home at the beginning of March. He was arrested but released on $7,500 (\u00a34,760) bail put up by his mother. Ms Whitehead, who works in a local discount store, went to stay with the family of an older colleague. Mr Palczynski then turned up at the house on March 7 and is thought to have killed the friend and her husband as well as a neighbour who came to help. During the incident he is also said to have kidnapped his ex-girlfriend. Ms Whitehead escaped unharmed, but not before Mr Palczynski allegedly shot and killed a woman the following day during a bloody car-jacking in which a mother and her two-year-old child were also wounded. Police believe Mr Palczynski travelled to Virginia last week and stole two guns and cash, then forced a man to drive him back to eastern Maryland. Since the siege began on Friday, Mr Palczynski, who has a history of domestic violence and has spent time in prison, is understood to have talked to police by telephone, demanding that food to sent into the home via a robot. The condition of the three captives is not known. Corporal Vickie Warehime said that the authorities wanted to keep talking to Mr Palczynski. \"We have been in constant contact with Mr Palczynski throughout the night. Our main focus is to have this come to a peaceful end.\" She added that a psychiatrist was also helping negotiators. Lynn Whitehead, Ms Whitehead's mother, had apparently been staying with relatives during the hunt for Mr Palczynski which was launched following the earlier deaths. She only returned home on Friday night and the 31-year-old electrician immediately shot his way into her home. Mr Palczynski is understood to have been involved in a similar siege in 1992 when he kept police at bay for 16 hours following a domestic violence complaint by a girlfriend. He was finally forced out with tear gas. In the latest siege, Mr Palczynski has repeatedly asked for Ms Whitehead in telephone conversations with police officers and the psychiatrist. He reportedly told her sister-in-law: \"I only want Tracy.\" Ms Whitehead is now being kept in a secret location by police. Relatives and friends, who have made appeals on local television to Mr Palczynski during the weekend siege, have said in the past that he would shoot himself or make police shoot him rather than go back to prison.",

      "body": "<p>More than three years after their six-year-old beauty queen daughter was found dead in their basement, John and Patsy Ramsey have reopened the case in the court of public opinion by denying that they were to blame.</p> <p>In a series of high-profile interviews timed to coincide with the publication of their book about the case, the couple suggest that the killer of JonBenet Ramsey was a paedophile who may have known the family.</p> <p>The book, The Death of Innocence: The Untold Story of JonBenet's Murder and how its Exploitation Compromised the Pursuit of Truth - appeared on Amazon.com's bestseller list as soon as it was published on Friday.</p> <p>Although a grand jury failed after 13 months' deliberation to indict the couple in October, they are still under an official \"umbrella of suspicion\". The local police force in Boulder, Colorado, has publicly criticised them for their failure to cooperate and most opinion polls show that the American public believe they are guilty of strangling and sexually abusing their daughter during the 1996 Christmas holiday.</p> <p>The couple have used several television interviews and a lengthy article in Newsweek, to be published today, to claim that such suspicions are allowing the police to stop looking for the real murderer.</p> <p>They accuse the police of simply trying to \"trip them up\" rather than find the murderer. Although largely positive, the interviews are likely to raise further questions about the murder that made the little girl with candy-floss hair and a heavily made-up face into what writer Joyce Carol Oates called \"the most famous little girl of our time\".</p> <p>The Ramseys tell Newsweek that they would now be willing to take a lie detector test, having previously declined to do so. John Ramsey says that the authorities once asked him to take a test but that he said such a request would \"offend\" him as a grieving parent.</p> <p>The couple set out to disprove alleged inconsistencies in their evidence. The most oft-quoted theory about the murder to date is that one of the parents bludgeoned JonBenet over something as minor as wetting the bed and then covered it up with a phoney ransom note.

      "bodyText": "More than three years after their six-year-old beauty queen daughter was found dead in their basement, John and Patsy Ramsey have reopened the case in the court of public opinion by denying that they were to blame. In a series of high-profile interviews timed to coincide with the publication of their book about the case, the couple suggest that the killer of JonBenet Ramsey was a paedophile who may have known the family. The book, The Death of Innocence: The Untold Story of JonBenet's Murder and how its Exploitation Compromised the Pursuit of Truth - appeared on Amazon.com's bestseller list as soon as it was published on Friday. Although a grand jury failed after 13 months' deliberation to indict the couple in October, they are still under an official \"umbrella of suspicion\". The local police force in Boulder, Colorado, has publicly criticised them for their failure to cooperate and most opinion polls show that the American public believe they are guilty of strangling and sexually abusing their daughter during the 1996 Christmas holiday. The couple have used several television interviews and a lengthy article in Newsweek, to be published today, to claim that such suspicions are allowing the police to stop looking for the real murderer. They accuse the police of simply trying to \"trip them up\" rather than find the murderer. Although largely positive, the interviews are likely to raise further questions about the murder that made the little girl with candy-floss hair and a heavily made-up face into what writer Joyce Carol Oates called \"the most famous little girl of our time\". The Ramseys tell Newsweek that they would now be willing to take a lie detector test, having previously declined to do so. John Ramsey says that the authorities once asked him to take a test but that he said such a request would \"offend\" him as a grieving parent. The couple set out to disprove alleged inconsistencies in their evidence. The most oft-quoted theory about the murder to date is that one of the parents bludgeoned JonBenet over something as minor as wetting the bed and then covered it up with a phoney ransom note. The ransom note found by the Ramseys demanded $118,000 (\u00a373,750), the exact amount Mr Ramsey was expecting to receive as his annual bonus that year. In trying to explain such a coincidence, Mr Ramsey said: \"Only the killer knows that. Why didn't they ask for a million dollars? What you have to think about, though, is that the person who did this is a madman.\" Mrs Ramsey, a former child beauty queen, has been accused of forcing her daughter to dress in inappropriate ways to win local pageants. She denies that she capped JonBenet's milk teeth, but she does admit to dyeing her daughter's hair to \"blend it\" with her sun-bleached summertime tresses. The Ramseys now admit to doubts about the wisdom of JonBenet's position as a beauty queen as she could have attracted her killer by behaving in what others have described as sexually provocative ways. In a book that provides little fresh evidence, the Ramseys raise seven facts which they believe back their claims of innocence. In particular, they point to an unidentified palm print on the door to the room where her body was found, unidentified DNA under the girl's fingernails and on her underwear, and an unmatched boot print near her body. The Ramseys use of the proceeds to the book is likely to be controversial, as most of it will be used to hefty pay legal expenses. Anything left is going to the children's' foundation they set up in their daughter's name. They have been criticised in the US press for setting up such a charity. Mr Ramsey said in one interview that the family was largely living on his retirement account. \"We will not profit a single dime from this book. I don't know exactly [how much we have spent] because we have spent money on lawyers and a lot of money on the investigation... What I do know is what I had in savings and what I don't have now.\" Other interviews, carried out without lawyers present, suggest that the Ramseys believe that they may have known the killer.

The death toll of devotion November 1978 In the largest cult-inspired mass suicide of recent times, 914 followers of the reverend Jim Jones's People's Temple died at Jonestown, Guyana. Most drank a grape punch that was laced with cyanide. Those who refused to drink it were shot. A sign over Jones's altar read: \"Those who forget the past are doomed to repeat it\". The paranoid pastor and his followers had moved to Guyana from the US amid allegations of abuse of power and funds. April 1993 A 51-day siege of a compound run by the Branch Davidian cult, led by David Koresh, at Waco, Texas, ended with the deaths of 70 cult members. A fire consumed the compound, which was surrounded by police and federal agents. Koresh, who believed he was Jesus Christ, died of a shot to the head. The end of the siege was re-enacted yesterday to see if gunshots from the military caused the blaze - a theory denied by the US government. October 1993 Fifty-three hill tribe villagers in a remote Vietnamese hamlet committed suicide using flintlocks and other primitive weapons after they were tricked out of money by a blind local leader who had promised to get them to heaven. Nineteen children were among the villagers who died in the hamlet of Ta He, about 200 miles north-west of Hanoi. The mass suicide was inspired by a man named Ca Van Liem who had proclaimed himself king. October 1994 The charred bodies of 48 members of the Solar Temple cult were found in a farmhouse and three chalets in Switzerland. At the same time five bodies, including one of a child, were discovered in a chalet near Montreal, in Canada. The cult, founded in 1980 by Luc Jouret, believes that sacrificial suicide leads to rebirth on a planet called Sirius. March 1997 Thirty-nine members of the Higher Source cult committed suicide at a mansion in Santa Fe, California. Police found the bodies of 21 women and 18 men lying face up with their arms by their sides. They were all dressed in black trousers and black tennis shoes and had purple triangular shrouds covering their faces and chests. The group are believed to have killed themselves by swallowing phenobarbital dissolved in apple sauce and vodka. The sect's leader, Marshall Applewhite, also died. The deaths were believed to have coincided with the arrival of the Hale-Bopp comet, which the cult members believed contained a space ship that would deliver them to a \"higher evolutionary level\" after they had shed their bodies. December 1991 A minister and 29 worshippers suffocated after toxic fumes filled a church in San Luis Potosi, Mexico. The minister, Ramon Morales Almazan, urged people to stay calm and keep praying as they began to choke on the fumes and vomit or faint. The minister is reported to have told his dying congregation that God was drawing near and that he could feel the presence of the Lord. March 1995 The Aum Shinri Kyo (Way of Divine Truth) cult killed 12 people and injured over 3,700 after releasing sarin nerve gas on the Tokyo subway. The cult, estimated at one time to have 30,000 members in Japan, believed it would help lead Japan into a military empire that would last 1,000 years. Its members venerated Shiva, the Hindu god of destruction and renewal, but also took inspiration from Buddhism. December 1995 Solar Temple members were found dead in a burned house outside Grenoble, in the French Alps. Sixteen corpses were discovered lying in a circle. The victims were killed by two cult members, who were policemen, after first being lured to an outdoor mass. March 1997 The burned bodies of five Solar Temple members were found in a house in Quebec, Canada. \u0095 Vikram Dodd",

It had always effectively been two departments with two philosophies, the \"trade\" half lobbying for international laissez-faire and the struggling \"industry\" bit bringing up the rear as a cut-price version of Japan's powerful industry ministry. From 1974 to 1983 they were in fact separated, and all the indications are that the DTI was allowed to reform itself only after mass unemployment had effectively smashed up the \"I\" part. </p> <p>It is likely that, sooner rather than later, the status quo ante will be restored, with a slimmed-down Board of Trade upholding unfettered free trade and a minuscule Ministry of Technology dutifully handing out fact sheets to businessmen on trading estates informing them of available government help (none). </p> <p>This will suit the Treasury view just fine; it never objected to the trade but merely to the industry. With the DTI razed to the ground and its field strewn with salt the Treasury can concentrate unhindered on the serious business of fronting for the City. </p> <p>The demise of Rover is a jolly omen for the DTI's old enemies with the role played by a high pound making victory all the sweeter.

It had always effectively been two departments with two philosophies, the \"trade\" half lobbying for international laissez-faire and the struggling \"industry\" bit bringing up the rear as a cut-price version of Japan's powerful industry ministry. From 1974 to 1983 they were in fact separated, and all the indications are that the DTI was allowed to reform itself only after mass unemployment had effectively smashed up the \"I\" part. It is likely that, sooner rather than later, the status quo ante will be restored, with a slimmed-down Board of Trade upholding unfettered free trade and a minuscule Ministry of Technology dutifully handing out fact sheets to businessmen on trading estates informing them of available government help (none). This will suit the Treasury view just fine; it never objected to the trade but merely to the industry. With the DTI razed to the ground and its field strewn with salt the Treasury can concentrate unhindered on the serious business of fronting for the City. The demise of Rover is a jolly omen for the DTI's old enemies with the role played by a high pound making victory all the sweeter. All's right with the world once more. Or perhaps not. Ten years ago Noel Annan reminded us that at the moment of victory for any idea - liberalism, the Victorian religious revival, imperialism - the reaction sets in. This reaction ultimately undoes the dominance of the idea in question. It would be pleasing to report such a reaction against the \"Treasury idea\". Such movements have to begin sometime and now is as good a time as any.",

      "body": "<p>Alan Bleasdale describes David Ross as \"the Scarlet Pimpernel of British theatre, our industry's best-kept secret.\" He has written 11 parts for him. \"That's more than anyone else,\" he says. \"And the role I'm writing for him now is as big as any anything I've done for him before.\" That role is a suicidal accountant in a six-part TV drama, loosely based on Bleasdale's stage play On the Ledge. </p> <p>Another Bleasdale stalwart, Julie Walters, says of Ross: \"Whatever role he's in, he always hits the central truth of it.\" And Michael Billington, Guardian theatre critic, described his Archie Rice in John Osborne's The Entertainer at the Birmingham Rep in 1996 as \"easily the best I've seen since Olivier's\". </p> <p>Yet Ross is hardly a household name. Bleasdale puts this anonymity down to his ability to \"change like a chameleon with every role\" - his parts have included Ratty in Wind in the Willows at the National, Gloucester in King Lear at the Manchester Royal Exchange, and Vera Duckworth's Blackpool fancy man in Coronation Street. The actor himself accepts that a low profile is the consequence of immersing himself so deeply in his characters. \"I played a horse thief in Heartbeat the other night and my own mother didn't recognise me,\" he admits cheerfully. </p> <p>We're talking in the bar of the Birmingham Rep where he's rehearsing Willy Loman in Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman. \"It's the first time I've played it in 14 years, and I'd forgotten how demanding it is vocally. Everything's on the top note.\" </p> <p>The New York accent, though, is no problem to him. Indeed, the only city whose speech pattern he can't master is Liverpool, which makes his professional relationship with Bleasdale all the more remarkable. \"We just had an affinity from the beginning,\" he says. \"With Alan's work, you have to play your emotions on the line rather than thinking about it and then doing it. You have to keep running with it and don't let it drop. But I still think my Liverpool accent sounds false. So in GBH I was the retired headteacher who spoke with received pronunciation, in Jake's progress I was a Yorkshire farmer, and in The Boys From the Black Stuff I was the DSS snooper from Blackburn.\" </p> <p>Ross was born in Blackburn at the end of the war and lived there with his first wife and two daughters until 10 years ago, when he finally moved to London. He still goes back to Lancashire at regular intervals to see friends and family, including his 90-year-old mother. His father died at 78, but not before he'd seen his son on television and managed to recognise him. Jack Ross was a bit of a performer himself. He ran the dance band at Oswaldtwistle Town Hall where entrance was a shilling, or sixpence after the interval. But he never gave up the day job at the mill. And when young David left school at 15, he went to work in a factory that manufactured industrial washing machines. </p> <p>\"I used to have to sit inside this big steel drum with a metal 'dolly' rammed into my shoulder,\" he recalls, \"while a bloke on the outside kept whacking in rivets with a two-pound hammer. No wonder I'm going deaf. It was a nightmare.\" One from which he escaped after eight months to take a job in a gentlemen's outfitters. He was already displaying signs of exhibitionism at 16 by sporting a bowler hat about town - not exactly conventional headgear in Blackburn then or now. \"I used to like to run the gauntlet a bit,\" he grins. By then he was already treading the boards at the Blackburn Arts Club. \"I only joined because I fancied a girl there called Julie Heath. Eventually she married a doctor and had seven children.\" </p> <p>Ross himself could well have remained a shop worker had his talent on stage not been spotted by a local worthy with a brother who was in rep in Barrow-in-Furness. \"I went up there with my mother when I was 17 or 18,\" he says. \"After three auditions and one day's rehearsal, I was playing a black homosexual boxer called Princess Grace in The Hostage by Brendan Behan. I had to black up with burnt cork.\" </p> <p>Not politically correct, he concedes, but then black actors weren't exactly queuing up for parts in early-60s Barrow. From there he moved on to Harrogate Rep and, in 1969, to drama school at Manchester Polytechnic where his contemporaries included Bernard Hill, Richard Griffiths and Julie Walters. \"David was two years above me,\" Walters recalls, \"but he seemed about 40 years older. He had big Victorian sideboards and smoked a long, curly pipe, so he looked like an extra in Sherlock Holmes. But I remember being very impressed by his eccentricity and the fact he'd been acting in the big world outside.\" </p> <p>Thirty years on, she remains impressed. \"His Mr Bumble [in Bleasdale's adaptation of Oliver Twist] was so brilliant it deserves a Bafta. I didn't think we'd get through the scenes because he was so funny in the character. He used four different sets of teeth in various stages of decay... You must ask him about his teeth.\" </p> <p>There's no need because he volunteers the subject himself. \"They're false,\" he says, beaming brightly over his mineral water. \"When I was a young man in Blackburn, people used to say: 'Have 'em all out, lad. You'll never regret it.' So I did, when I was 20.\" </p> <p>And, no, he hasn't regretted it. Not professionally, anyway.

      "body": "<p>Former Tesco boss Lord MacLaurin, one of the most respected elder statesmen of British retailing, has been signed up to join one of the teams attempting to take over Storehouse, the ailing Bhs and Mothercare group. </p> <p>Lord MacLaurin, who is chairman of the English Cricket Board, and John Manser, a leading City banker and chairman of Robert Fleming, have been recruited by Nigel Whittaker and Stephen Tucker to lend authority to their no-bid takeover plan. </p> <p>Former Kingfisher director Mr Whittaker and Mr Tucker, a Monaco-based car parks millionaire, want to persuade disgruntled Storehouse investors that they can install new management and extract more value from the loss-making company than a cash bidder. </p> <p>Storehouse has admitted it has had several approaches from potential bidders. Iceland, the food retailer, has shown an interest and discounter Brown &amp; Jackson is also thought to be interested. The struggling company's share price has slumped to just 45p, valuing the group at less than \u00a3200m. </p> <p>\"I would become non-executive chairman and Stephen Tucker would be a major shareholder\", said Mr Whittaker last night. \"If we are successful than we will have Lord MacLaurin and John Manser as non-executive directors. </p> <p>\"At this moment we have no intention of making a bid. We just want to manage it. The value of the business has to be got back to shareholders, because at the moment it is just dribbling away.\" </p> <p>The proposed management team would have a big incentive to succeed, but Mr Whittaker says shareholders could get a bigger return than from a bidder who would have to pay \u00a320m in fees to bankers and other advisers. He would not rule out mounting a full takeover if the group's overtures were unsuccessful. </p> <p>He said the team's plans involved selling Mothercare and around 60 of the best-positioned Bhs stores. The remaining one hundred, he said, \"are in secondary locations and could become an effective value business, with the emphasis on sharp pricing\". </p> <p>Mr Whittaker said he was unsure whether his team would stick by the deal put together last year by Storehouse chairman Alan Smith which would put 100 Iceland foodhalls inside Bhs stores. </p> <p>\"I'm not that keen on the food business, but we would need to look at the numbers before deciding ,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Whittaker met the Storehouse chairman last week but has so far been denied access to Storehouse's financial information. One major Storehouse shareholder, Templeton, is understood to have asked Mr Smith if he will hand the group's books to the Tucker/Whittaker team. </p> <p>Mr Whittaker says he has already contacted several Storehouse investors and found a lot of support for his scheme. He is now planning a round of meetings with other Storehouse investors.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Former Tesco boss Lord MacLaurin, one of the most respected elder statesmen of British retailing, has been signed up to join one of the teams attempting to take over Storehouse, the ailing Bhs and Mothercare group. Lord MacLaurin, who is chairman of the English Cricket Board, and John Manser, a leading City banker and chairman of Robert Fleming, have been recruited by Nigel Whittaker and Stephen Tucker to lend authority to their no-bid takeover plan. Former Kingfisher director Mr Whittaker and Mr Tucker, a Monaco-based car parks millionaire, want to persuade disgruntled Storehouse investors that they can install new management and extract more value from the loss-making company than a cash bidder. Storehouse has admitted it has had several approaches from potential bidders. Iceland, the food retailer, has shown an interest and discounter Brown &amp; Jackson is also thought to be interested. The struggling company's share price has slumped to just 45p, valuing the group at less than \u00a3200m. \"I would become non-executive chairman and Stephen Tucker would be a major shareholder\", said Mr Whittaker last night. \"If we are successful than we will have Lord MacLaurin and John Manser as non-executive directors. \"At this moment we have no intention of making a bid. We just want to manage it. The value of the business has to be got back to shareholders, because at the moment it is just dribbling away.\" The proposed management team would have a big incentive to succeed, but Mr Whittaker says shareholders could get a bigger return than from a bidder who would have to pay \u00a320m in fees to bankers and other advisers. He would not rule out mounting a full takeover if the group's overtures were unsuccessful. He said the team's plans involved selling Mothercare and around 60 of the best-positioned Bhs stores. The remaining one hundred, he said, \"are in secondary locations and could become an effective value business, with the emphasis on sharp pricing\". Mr Whittaker said he was unsure whether his team would stick by the deal put together last year by Storehouse chairman Alan Smith which would put 100 Iceland foodhalls inside Bhs stores. \"I'm not that keen on the food business, but we would need to look at the numbers before deciding ,\" he said. Mr Whittaker met the Storehouse chairman last week but has so far been denied access to Storehouse's financial information. One major Storehouse shareholder, Templeton, is understood to have asked Mr Smith if he will hand the group's books to the Tucker/Whittaker team. Mr Whittaker says he has already contacted several Storehouse investors and found a lot of support for his scheme. He is now planning a round of meetings with other Storehouse investors.",

Goodkind called in designers Nowicka Sterns for some bright ideas. \"It became obvious that we needed a concept to make it work, to bring it to life.

For \u00a312,000 the designers installed a boxed rectangle of grass that lives in the middle of the office, complete with irrigation system beneath and specialised lighting above. \"OK, it's quite a lot of money, but some companies might pay that for a boardroom table or a bit of art.

An internet business is a pretty high-pressured, quick-moving environment.\" </p> <p>Elsewhere in the office, assistant Kally Wilson is charged with offering visitors a seat on the set of chrome swings in the lobby.

Picking apart the jargon, what this means in practice is that there are no senior managers' offices at the company: at best they get a desk near a window. No longer does each employee have a desk - there is little point if consultants are spending most of the day working with clients outside the office. Instead, they have \"touchdown points\" where they can plug in laptops and phones while sitting on tall stools with a view of the world going by on the Strand. </p> <p>Those working in creative teams are sent to the \"chaos room\" where all desks are on wheels and can be rearranged as required. Meeting rooms have colours rather than names or numbers - the green, blue, red and white spaces are based on psychologist Edward de Bono's \"thinking hats\" theory, which asserts that certain colours aid particular modes of thinking. The salesman's favourite, the flip chart, is gone, replaced with a high-tech whiteboard which when written on reproduces the text on to a linked-in computer. \"Zen zones\", with fish tanks and notices on the walls reading \"no interruptions, no calls, no bookings\", are a haven of tranquillity and productivity. </p> <p>Movement within the offices is minimal - there are no traditional corridors, for instance. And almost everything has changed - instead of going to the canteen for a cup of coffee, you now head for the \"breakout zone\". With the new concept of office design comes a new vocabulary. </p> <p>Brian Bentley head of the strategic analysis team at BDG McColl, says: \"We pride ourselves on listening to our clients' needs and how we can serve them.

But not everyone is convinced it is the best way to run a company. At its most extreme, the principle is very simple: decide which people are essential to an enterprise, and get rid of the rest. Administrative staff are supplied, sometimes in bulk, by outside agencies and are generally employed as temps or on short-term contracts. Virtually nobody directly employs cleaners, so why not tackle the basic tasks of office administration the same way? </p> <p>Many sociologists have been unhappy about outsourcing, predicting a grey \"age of anxiety\" in which nobody really works for anybody. But studies have tended to show that short-term contract workers are less anxious than their fully employed peers. Temps acquire a broad range of skills and experience, while those who stay put may have limited opportunities for learning anything new. Much of it is a question of mindset, of course. Temps are used to flexible working, but the thought that any Friday they might be replaced by outsourced staff does not do much for fully employed workers' peace of mind. </p> <p>But what of the employers? While nobody disputes that outsourcing can be a valuable strategy, some are beginning to move against the trend. \"There is a time to outsource and a time to insource,\" says David Hagan, a director at M&amp;G Investment Management. \"It is a question of getting the balance right.\" In his case, one of the factors in the balance is communication. As investment managers strive to become more accountable to their clients, they must have support staff who understand the business. \"Nothing must be lost in communication,\" says Hagan, arguing that this can best be achieved if the individuals work permanently together. </p> <p>Miranda Smyth, head of marketing at specialist legal recruiters ZMB, says that the need for good understanding makes outsourcing an entire operation very difficult. There are jobs that are best tackled by outsiders - strategic analysis, for example, which obviously benefits from a fresh set of eyes with no emotional attachment. But even apparently straightforward functions, such as typing, can be difficult for an outsider. All ZMB's documents conform to a house style, and unless the person entering it into the system understands it, the job will have to be done again. \"The fact is that an employee using their knowledge of the structure and the politics of an organisation will get the end product signed off more quickly,\" says Smyth. </p> <p>There are advantages for employees too. Keeping staff in-house, says Hagan, \"gives people a chance to develop themselves\". Properly managed, the stability of a regular job can be as dynamic as the hurly-burly of the short-term contract. \"People have the opportunity to work in several areas, and to test the waters in something which may not immediately appeal.\" The opportunity to develop new skills is, he says \"the essence of a happy workforce\". It goes without saying that well-trained and happy employers are more likely to \"add value\" beyond their basic job description. </p> <p>As yet the trend towards outsourcing shows no sign of abating. Perhaps David Hagan and Miranda Smyth take a more independent view because they have both had varied careers themselves. She qualified as a solicitor, and he was a research physicist. One does not have to be a rocket scientist to see the sense in their arguments.</p>",

While nobody disputes that outsourcing can be a valuable strategy, some are beginning to move against the trend. \"There is a time to outsource and a time to insource,\" says David Hagan, a director at M&amp;G Investment Management. \"It is a question of getting the balance right.\" In his case, one of the factors in the balance is communication. As investment managers strive to become more accountable to their clients, they must have support staff who understand the business. \"Nothing must be lost in communication,\" says Hagan, arguing that this can best be achieved if the individuals work permanently together. Miranda Smyth, head of marketing at specialist legal recruiters ZMB, says that the need for good understanding makes outsourcing an entire operation very difficult. There are jobs that are best tackled by outsiders - strategic analysis, for example, which obviously benefits from a fresh set of eyes with no emotional attachment. But even apparently straightforward functions, such as typing, can be difficult for an outsider. All ZMB's documents conform to a house style, and unless the person entering it into the system understands it, the job will have to be done again. \"The fact is that an employee using their knowledge of the structure and the politics of an organisation will get the end product signed off more quickly,\" says Smyth. There are advantages for employees too. Keeping staff in-house, says Hagan, \"gives people a chance to develop themselves\". Properly managed, the stability of a regular job can be as dynamic as the hurly-burly of the short-term contract. \"People have the opportunity to work in several areas, and to test the waters in something which may not immediately appeal.\" The opportunity to develop new skills is, he says \"the essence of a happy workforce\". It goes without saying that well-trained and happy employers are more likely to \"add value\" beyond their basic job description. As yet the trend towards outsourcing shows no sign of abating. Perhaps David Hagan and Miranda Smyth take a more independent view because they have both had varied careers themselves. She qualified as a solicitor, and he was a research physicist. One does not have to be a rocket scientist to see the sense in their arguments.",
