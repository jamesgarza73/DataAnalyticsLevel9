      "body": "<p>Aside from Peter Pan, we pay scant attention to the plays of J M Barrie. He is seen as sexless, whimsical, sentimental. There is some truth in that but he was also one of the oddest, most original voices in 20th-century British drama. And, as Nottingham's excellent revival of this 1917 play proves, he had a poetic feeling for loss and deprivation. </p> <p>Original may seem a strange word to apply to a work that has strong echoes of A Midsummer Night's Dream, with which it plays in repertory here. The setting is a country-house with a garden bathed in midsummer moonlight, owned by an aged Puck known as Lob. His carefully chosen house-guests include a reckless philanderer and his neglected wife, an alcoholic artist married to a childless snob, and a disdainful female aristo. </p> <p>In the middle-act the characters find themselves, at Lob's behest, in an echanted wood where they get a second chance to live out their illusions. When they return it is to discover that they are the victims of character rather than fate and that they would always take life's wrong turning. </p> <p>You could accuse Barrie of pyschological determinism, though oddly Jeremy Sams's adaptation omits a line referring to \"the ones with the thin bright faces\" who do actually change their lives. But I was struck by Barrie's huge influence on later dramatists - this is the precursor of Priestley's time-plays and Ayckbourn's comic meditations on chance. Barrie also dramatises, with bruising honesty, his own obsession with childhood innocence and emotional loss. </p> <p>In the wood the drunken painter, appropriately named Dearth, encounters the daughter, Margaret, he never had, and underneath the archness of their exchanges (\"Fame is rot, daughters are the thing\") you hear Barrie's extraordinary private desolation. Like Peter Pan, he was the boy who never grew up and was clearly wracked by his sexual impotence. </p> <p>It is a play full of self-revelation. It is also bizarrely comic, so much so that when the vain philanderer announced that his wife didn't understand him a raucous voice from the stalls cried out \"she knows what you're up to\". But Richard Baron's production works precisely because it acknowledges the work's pantomimic excesses while capturing its haunting magic. </p> <p>Edward Lipscomb has designed a beautiful set that takes us from a darkened, oak-panelled drawing-room to a moonlit wood. And there are strong performances from Angus Lennie, looking like an aged, velvet-breeched Fauntleroy, as the mischievous Lob, from Gareth Thomas as the childless artist and Veronica Leer as his fantasy-daughter. One of Sams's best interpolations is to have her return at the end and beat vainly on the locked drawing-room windows. That moment, with its obvious echoes of Peter Pan, reminds us that Barrie was the 20th-century's supreme poet of arrested development. </p> <p>In rep until October 21.

      "bodyText": "Aside from Peter Pan, we pay scant attention to the plays of J M Barrie. He is seen as sexless, whimsical, sentimental. There is some truth in that but he was also one of the oddest, most original voices in 20th-century British drama. And, as Nottingham's excellent revival of this 1917 play proves, he had a poetic feeling for loss and deprivation. Original may seem a strange word to apply to a work that has strong echoes of A Midsummer Night's Dream, with which it plays in repertory here. The setting is a country-house with a garden bathed in midsummer moonlight, owned by an aged Puck known as Lob. His carefully chosen house-guests include a reckless philanderer and his neglected wife, an alcoholic artist married to a childless snob, and a disdainful female aristo. In the middle-act the characters find themselves, at Lob's behest, in an echanted wood where they get a second chance to live out their illusions. When they return it is to discover that they are the victims of character rather than fate and that they would always take life's wrong turning. You could accuse Barrie of pyschological determinism, though oddly Jeremy Sams's adaptation omits a line referring to \"the ones with the thin bright faces\" who do actually change their lives. But I was struck by Barrie's huge influence on later dramatists - this is the precursor of Priestley's time-plays and Ayckbourn's comic meditations on chance. Barrie also dramatises, with bruising honesty, his own obsession with childhood innocence and emotional loss. In the wood the drunken painter, appropriately named Dearth, encounters the daughter, Margaret, he never had, and underneath the archness of their exchanges (\"Fame is rot, daughters are the thing\") you hear Barrie's extraordinary private desolation. Like Peter Pan, he was the boy who never grew up and was clearly wracked by his sexual impotence. It is a play full of self-revelation. It is also bizarrely comic, so much so that when the vain philanderer announced that his wife didn't understand him a raucous voice from the stalls cried out \"she knows what you're up to\". But Richard Baron's production works precisely because it acknowledges the work's pantomimic excesses while capturing its haunting magic. Edward Lipscomb has designed a beautiful set that takes us from a darkened, oak-panelled drawing-room to a moonlit wood. And there are strong performances from Angus Lennie, looking like an aged, velvet-breeched Fauntleroy, as the mischievous Lob, from Gareth Thomas as the childless artist and Veronica Leer as his fantasy-daughter. One of Sams's best interpolations is to have her return at the end and beat vainly on the locked drawing-room windows. That moment, with its obvious echoes of Peter Pan, reminds us that Barrie was the 20th-century's supreme poet of arrested development. In rep until October 21. Box Office: 0115 941 9419.",

Serbia is on the brink of revolution, after anti-government demonstrators seized control of the parliament building in Belgrade and set it on fire. But the Yugoslav army has said that it will not intervene to halt the demonstrations, adding to hopes that Mr Milosevic's regime has collapsed. In what could be the endgame for President Slobodan Milosevic, demonstrators said dozens of police at the federal parliament and the state-run TV station had joined crowds taking control of both buildings. State television came back on air at about 8pm London time, apparently under opposition control. There are unconfirmed reports that the Yugolsav army has been in contact with the opposition crisis committee, according to the B92 radio station. Opposition leader Vojislav Kostunica this evening appealed for calm and urged demonstrators to return to work tomorrow, amid signs that he had lost control of the protests against Mr Milosevic\u00d5s continuing rule.

Go before any more lives are lost, before there is any more destruction.</p> <p>\"And I say this to the people of Serbia, whatever the differences that have been between us.</p> <p>\"Now that you have reached for democracy, the hand of friendship and partnership from countries like Britain is there for you, so that together, in whatever way we can, we will rebuild this troubled part of Europe and secure a peaceful and prosperous future for all the people there.\"</p> <p>Foreign Secretary Robin Cook delivered a similar uncompromising message to the Yugoslav leader challenging him to go and go quickly.</p> <p>US President Clinton, meanwhile, ruled out US military intervention in Yugoslavia in a formal statement, confirming Mr Cook's earlier remark to that effect.</p> <p>Mr Clinton branded Milosevic's regime \"a hardcore dictatorship\" and said: \"I think the people are trying to get their country back, and we support democracy and the will of the Serbian people.\"</p> <p>Speaking with reporters in the White House's rose garden after an education event, the president said: \"All we want for the Serbian people (is)...the right to freely choose their own leaders.\"</p> <p>Asked if the United States might intervene militarily, he said, \"I don't believe it's an appropriate case for military intervention.\" He said the United States should not do or say anything that would strengthen Milosevic.</p> <p>Mr Cook made it clear that western governments would not intervene to spare the president prosecution by the war crimes tribunal in a deal to make him stand down in favour of the opposition leader, Vojislav Kostunica, widely believed to have won the election 10 days ago.</p> <p>\"Ten days ago the people of Serbia rejected Milosevic at the ballot box. Today they have rejected him on the streets of Belgrade,\" Mr Cook said.</p> <p>\"It is a powerful demonstration of the extent to which across Serbia, not just in Belgrade, people reject Milosevic as president.</p> <p>\"Milosevic was unpopular at the time of the ballot, 10 days ago.</p> <p>\"Now he is evidently held in even greater contempt by the people because of his attempts to rob them of their votes.\"</p> <p>Speaking at the Conservative conference in Bournemouth today, Shadow Foreign Secretary Francis Maude said: \"This is the last desperate attempt by Slobodan Milosevic to buy time and exhaust his opponents.\"</p> <p>Speaking in London Mr Cook repeated the message.</p> <p>\"Everyone else in Serbia knows that Milosevic has lost any right to office. If Milosevic dares go to his window today, he will see the people want him out,\" Mr Cook told reporters.</p> <p>\"Milosevic must go, the only question now is how and when he goes.</p> <p>\"The sooner he goes, the sooner we can get on with the fresh start we want for the people of Serbia, rebuilding their country and rebuilding bridges with a modern Europe. Today's demonstrations were markedly different from previous opposition action,\" Mr Cook said.</p> <p>\"He is confronted today not just with words but possibly a million people on the streets calling for him to go and he is confronted across the country with industrial action,\" the foreign secretary said.</p> <p>However, he ruled out direction action to aid the protesters in their struggle with the security forces.</p> <p>\"I'm not making threats. The last thing that would be helpful for the people of Serbia today is threats. That is what he wants,\" he said.</p> <p>Asked about the possibility of a war crimes amnesty to ease Milosevic's exit from office, Mr Cook said: \"It is not a matter for governments, it is a matter for the war crimes tribunal.\"</p> <p>Separately, Germany called on the Yugoslav army and security forces not to use force against protesters demanding that President Slobodan Milosevic step down, according to Reuters.</p> <p>\"Milosevic has lost the elections,\" Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said in a statement. \"Now the way must be cleared for the will of the Serbian people to take effect. The army and police, too, must respect the will of the Yugoslavs and should not use force against the people.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair today called in a statement for Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to stand down. Outside Downing Street as he left for Warsaw tonight, Mr Blair said: \"The verdict from the elections was clear. The verdict on the streets is clear. The message for Milosevic is clear. \"Go. Go now. Go before any more lives are lost, before there is any more destruction. \"And I say this to the people of Serbia, whatever the differences that have been between us. \"Now that you have reached for democracy, the hand of friendship and partnership from countries like Britain is there for you, so that together, in whatever way we can, we will rebuild this troubled part of Europe and secure a peaceful and prosperous future for all the people there.\" Foreign Secretary Robin Cook delivered a similar uncompromising message to the Yugoslav leader challenging him to go and go quickly. US President Clinton, meanwhile, ruled out US military intervention in Yugoslavia in a formal statement, confirming Mr Cook's earlier remark to that effect. Mr Clinton branded Milosevic's regime \"a hardcore dictatorship\" and said: \"I think the people are trying to get their country back, and we support democracy and the will of the Serbian people.\" Speaking with reporters in the White House's rose garden after an education event, the president said: \"All we want for the Serbian people (is)...the right to freely choose their own leaders.\" Asked if the United States might intervene militarily, he said, \"I don't believe it's an appropriate case for military intervention.\" He said the United States should not do or say anything that would strengthen Milosevic. Mr Cook made it clear that western governments would not intervene to spare the president prosecution by the war crimes tribunal in a deal to make him stand down in favour of the opposition leader, Vojislav Kostunica, widely believed to have won the election 10 days ago. \"Ten days ago the people of Serbia rejected Milosevic at the ballot box. Today they have rejected him on the streets of Belgrade,\" Mr Cook said. \"It is a powerful demonstration of the extent to which across Serbia, not just in Belgrade, people reject Milosevic as president. \"Milosevic was unpopular at the time of the ballot, 10 days ago. \"Now he is evidently held in even greater contempt by the people because of his attempts to rob them of their votes.\" Speaking at the Conservative conference in Bournemouth today, Shadow Foreign Secretary Francis Maude said: \"This is the last desperate attempt by Slobodan Milosevic to buy time and exhaust his opponents.\" Speaking in London Mr Cook repeated the message. \"Everyone else in Serbia knows that Milosevic has lost any right to office. If Milosevic dares go to his window today, he will see the people want him out,\" Mr Cook told reporters. \"Milosevic must go, the only question now is how and when he goes. \"The sooner he goes, the sooner we can get on with the fresh start we want for the people of Serbia, rebuilding their country and rebuilding bridges with a modern Europe. Today's demonstrations were markedly different from previous opposition action,\" Mr Cook said. \"He is confronted today not just with words but possibly a million people on the streets calling for him to go and he is confronted across the country with industrial action,\" the foreign secretary said. However, he ruled out direction action to aid the protesters in their struggle with the security forces. \"I'm not making threats. The last thing that would be helpful for the people of Serbia today is threats. That is what he wants,\" he said. Asked about the possibility of a war crimes amnesty to ease Milosevic's exit from office, Mr Cook said: \"It is not a matter for governments, it is a matter for the war crimes tribunal.\" Separately, Germany called on the Yugoslav army and security forces not to use force against protesters demanding that President Slobodan Milosevic step down, according to Reuters. \"Milosevic has lost the elections,\" Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said in a statement. \"Now the way must be cleared for the will of the Serbian people to take effect. The army and police, too, must respect the will of the Yugoslavs and should not use force against the people.\"",

She had moved to bump her rival's speech off the front page of yesterday's Daily Telegraph by briefing selected reporters - on her own initiative - on her latest drugs initiative soon after he sat down. Mr Portillo knew nothing of the crackdown until told by reporters. Unsurprisingly, he disapproves. </p> <p> The very gay people and black people he sought to include in William Hague's big tent are certain to have their share of drug users, whose recreational gear might cost them a \u00a3100 fine if stopped by the police, as they so disproportionately are. </p> <p> How serious is this renewed culture war in the Tory ranks between its liberal, even libertarian tendency and its social authoritarians? As Mr Hague struggles to find a new language in which to address disaffected, disrespectful voters it is potentially very serious - both with the voters and with those who may seek to wrest the leadership from him after the coming election. </p> <p> Though he dabbles in rightwing populism few who know Mr Hague well doubt that he is anything but a privately tolerant man for whom Norman Tebbit's viscerally narrow agenda - cricket tests and all - is unpalatable as well as outdated. This week the internet is (as usual) awash with dodgy allegations about the private lives of \"Tory hypocrites\". Some colleagues believe Mr Portillo is the genuinely chastened man he appears to be precisely because he has been on the receiving end of some brutal social exclusion in the tabloids over his youthful sexual adventures. </p> <p> His chastened mood, they muse, suggest he fears the newspaper files are not yet empty. Certainly he does not disport himself like a threat to Hague who has brought the Tories back from the near-dead, if not yet to electability. </p> <p> Mr Hague's instinct for social tolerance is buttressed by key staff at Tory HQ, policy advisers like Danny Finkelstein (ex-SDP) and Sebastian Coe and by the bulk of the shadow cabinet. Francis Maude, the shadow foreign secretary, made a similar plea for inclusivity to Portillo's on the same day. He too has been on what Mr Portillo called a long journey: his gay brother died of Aids. The likes of Michael Ancram, David Willetts, Theresa May and Archie Norman are up for tolerance too. </p> <p> Steve Norris, still a player in the party, showed the way forward in his inclusive campaign for London mayor. </p> <p> They will prevail if Mr Hague survives the coming election with a decent result, a Labour majority halved for instance. Tory MPs are also increasingly aware that another reason for keeping him is that the post-Hague leadership battle would probably be Portillo against Widdecombe. Under Mr Hague's own rule book activists would then ballot on the winner. That is the underlying signficance of this week's conference beauty parade. \"They'd pick Ann,\" murmur alarmed MPs. </p> <p> John Redwood, ousted, then reinstated and still ambitious, is instinctively a Widdecomber. So is smooth Iain Duncan Smith, the Tory defence spokesman for whose speech Lady Thatcher got up early for, a sign of favour.

Why not, Margaret was, comes back the answer. Is Miss Widdecombe, for all her popular virtues, the politician to take the Tories back to power? MPs ask each other.

Deriding New Labour as a \"fashion\" whose time had passed, he combined a commitment to improve the quality of public services, particularly in inner cities, with a tough line on issues such as crime, taxation and Europe. \"This week the people of Britain look to us to see if we are ready to be a government,\" he said, claiming that his party's conference had proved this \"beyond doubt\". He challenged Tony Blair to call the election immediately, and derided the government in a string of effective jokes. \"Last week in Brighton the security was so tight it was Wednesday before they stabbed each other in the back,\" he said, describing the government as \"divided, arrogant and out of touch\". Nowhere was this more apparent, he said, than with the Dome. \"There it is, the Dome: the first paragraph of their manifesto and the last word about their Government,\" he said. The word which dominated was \"people\", an effort to contrast the Tories' grasp of popular concern over issues such as petrol tax with the government's refusal to compromise with protesters. \"For all the people who think that the law should be on the side of the house-owner and not the house-breaker - I'm in it for you,\" Hague said. \"For all the people who want to keep the pound - I'm in it for you.\" Throughout the Tory leader sought to appeal to what he called the \"mainstream\". \"The people I grew up with and millions like them are the mainstream of this country. They are the people who motivate me,\" he said. There was only a brief mention of \"tolerance, mutual respect and the rich diversity of this country\" - in contrast to Michael Portillo's address earlier in the week. That speech is believed to have led to a row between the shadow chancellor and the party leader. Arguing that \"wanting to pay less tax isn't greedy\", Hague laid out his position on taxation, certain to be one of the key battlegrounds at the election.

      "body": "<b> Foreign Secretary</b> <br> Good Afternoon. Ten days ago the people of Serbia rejected Milosevic in the ballot box. Today they have rejected him on the streets of Belgrade. The information I am receiving from Belgrade is of massive demonstrations on the streets. From all over Serbia people have converged on Belgrade. I am told that the convoy from Nis alone was 58 kilometres long \u0096 a powerful demonstration of the extent to which across Serbia, not just in Belgrade, people reject Milosevic as the President of their country. <p> Milosevic was unpopular at the time of the ballot 10 days ago. Now he is evidently held in even greater contempt by the people because of his attempts to rob them of their vote. Today's demonstration is a powerful, convincing statement of the wish of the Serb people to be rid of Milosevic. Everyone else in Serbia knows that Milosevic has lost any right to be in office and if Milosevic dares go to his window today he will see for himself that Serbia wants him out. </p> <p>Milosevic must go. The only question now is how and when he will go. Those are questions for him. The longer he postpones his departure, the longer will be the disruption to which he condemns Serbia, and the sooner he goes the sooner we can get on with the fresh start we want for the Serb people, rebuilding their country and rebuilding its bridges to the modern Europe. All that is necessary is for Milosevic to get out of the way and to let the Serb people have the fresh start for which they voted.</p> <p> <b>Question:</b><br> What help will Britain give the people of Yugoslavia now to achieve this?</p> <p> <b> Foreign Secretary</b><br> We have made it clear all along that the moment there is a change in Yugoslavia, all sanctions will go and we will start the task of reconstruction of Serbia with the people of Serbia. We have already been in contact with the Commission to discuss what we can move on quickly, for instance on the clearing of the Danube to which Milosevic is the last remaining obstruction.</p> <p> <b>Question:</b><br> If Mr Milosevic successfully stalls this situation, as is possible, what else can you do, because we all know that words don't matter to this man?</p> <p> <b> Foreign Secretary</b><br> He is confronted today not just with words, he is confronted with possibly approaching a million people on the streets demonstrating their demand that he should go. He is confronted also in Serbia with industrial action, sometimes by the very people who have supported him in the past, such as the coalminers who used to be a stronghold of support for him. He is under immense pressure. It is not just rhetoric that he can see outside his window today.</p> <p> <b>Question:</b><br> Is there anything left that you can do, that Britain can do?</p> <p> <b> Foreign Secretary</b><br> I am not making threats. The last thing that would be helpful to Serb people at the present time would be for me to give any threat to Milosevic. Believe me that is what he wants so that he can try and play what he would pretend would be a patriotic card. The people who are posing the threat to Milosevic are his own people, they want him out, it is called democracy, they voted him out, they are determined to get their way with their vote.</p> <p> <b>Question:</b><br> If things degenerate into bloodshed, is there a point at which you think NATO should get involved?</p> <p> <b> Foreign Secretary</b><br> I think the least helpful thing I could do today would be to respond with a positive answer to that question. No, we have no plans for intervention, we have no intentions of intervention, we want Milosevic to go so that we can work as partners and allies with the Serb people to reconstruct their country.</p> <p> <b>Question:</b><br> What are your contacts with other western governments on the question of any formula for amnesty for Milosevic as part of a bargain for getting him out? Is it out of the question?</p> <p> <b> Foreign Secretary</b><br> It is not a matter for governments, it is a matter for the War Crimes Tribunal who they bring charges against. They have chosen to indict President Milosevic. It is not for us to second-guess that indictment, it is a matter for the Tribunal to decide in the fullness of time when a hearing may be held against Milosevic on the basis of that indictment. And, indeed if I may say so, I think the way in which Britain and other countries have pursued the war criminals from the wars across the former Yugoslavia is one of the pressures on Milosevic and one of the signs that Serbia must change if it is to join the modern world.</p> <p> <b>Question:</b><br> Do you have any active contacts with Mr Kostunica?</p> <p> <b> Foreign Secretary</b><br> Mr Kostunica has briefed the representatives of the western Diplomatic Corps within Belgrade and of course we hear those responses from him. I am also in active contact with a number of the other Foreign Ministers around Europe, with Madeleine Albright, and I have spoken 3 times in the past 5 days with Igor Ivanov, the Russian Foreign Minister. There is an impressive degree of common ground between all of us, including Russia, that Milosevic lost in that first ballot, that he should respect the wishes of the people and that we should all work together to make sure that the people of Serbia get the change they voted for and get the fresh start that can come with that change.</p>",

It's nonsense to say we are dumbing down.\" </p> <p>He also said the new schedule meant there would be fewer half hourdocusoaps and DIY-style programmes used to fill awkward slots caused by the 9pm news buffer. </p> <p>\"There had been a plethora of docusoaps which made the schedule feel rather thin,\" he said. \"You don't feel that way with this new schedule. Moving the news to 10pm was a critical part of the creative revival of BBC1.\" </p> <p>Mr Thompson conceded that some Panorama staff had been unhappy at the move of the programme to Sundays but stuck to his line that more viewers would be available in the new slot.</p>",

Where are the serious documentaries and current affairs on BBC1? This is ITV without the adverts and is that what viewers pay their licence fee for?\" Mark Thompson, director of Television at the BBC rebutted the claim and said he hoped the schedule would calm fears among some observers that BBC1 is moving downmarket. The BBC came into direct conflict with Culture secretary Chris Smith by its decision to alter the schedule. Mr Thompson said: \"This is no less public service than it was with the news at 9pm. ITV won't have programmes like Have I Got News for You, or Panorama. We still have contemporary dramas to come like The Sins with Pete Postlethwaite and Sir David Attenborough's State of the Planet. It's nonsense to say we are dumbing down.\" He also said the new schedule meant there would be fewer half hourdocusoaps and DIY-style programmes used to fill awkward slots caused by the 9pm news buffer. \"There had been a plethora of docusoaps which made the schedule feel rather thin,\" he said. \"You don't feel that way with this new schedule. Moving the news to 10pm was a critical part of the creative revival of BBC1.\" Mr Thompson conceded that some Panorama staff had been unhappy at the move of the programme to Sundays but stuck to his line that more viewers would be available in the new slot.",

Here are the five most often asked about vacuum cleaners: </p> <p> <strong> 1. Which is better, upright or a cylinder? </strong> </p> <p> An upright cleaner is generally better for cut-pile carpets because a rotating brush (beater bar) in its cleaning head not only beats and sucks out the dirt but also lifts the carpet pile. However, some cylinder cleaners have a turbo brush attachment that does the same job. For natural fibre flooring, hard floors and loop-pile carpet, you are better off with a cylinder cleaner, which relies on suction alone to pick up dirt. If you prefer using an upright, look for one with the option to turn off the beater bar, or with an automatically adjustable cleaning head. </p> <p> <strong> 2 What type would be a good choice for asthma sufferers?</strong> </p> <p> Look for a vacuum cleaner that has a filter efficiency of at least 95%. This refers to the proportion of tiny dust particles that are retained in the bag or canister. It is not a measure of how efficiently it picks up dirt. </p> <p> <strong> 3 How important is wattage?</strong> </p> <p> A common misconception is that vacuum cleaners with the highest power ratings (watts) work best. Wattage relates to how much electricity is used rather than the amount of dirt sucked up. Until all manufacturers test to the same performance standards, you'll have to take our word for it. </p> <p> <strong> 4 Pet hairs are a constant problem in our house, so what should I look for?</strong> </p> <p> A cleaner with a beater bar or turbo brush will help lift pet hairs, but avoid using it on loop-pile or natural floor coverings as the beating action could damage the surface. </p> <p> <strong> 5 What about stairs?</strong> </p> <p> Cylinder cleaners are generally lighter and more compact and so easier to carry around. Look for one that is small enough or specially designed to balance well on steps or has a long flexible hose.</p>",

Here are the five most often asked about vacuum cleaners: 1. Which is better, upright or a cylinder? An upright cleaner is generally better for cut-pile carpets because a rotating brush (beater bar) in its cleaning head not only beats and sucks out the dirt but also lifts the carpet pile. However, some cylinder cleaners have a turbo brush attachment that does the same job. For natural fibre flooring, hard floors and loop-pile carpet, you are better off with a cylinder cleaner, which relies on suction alone to pick up dirt. If you prefer using an upright, look for one with the option to turn off the beater bar, or with an automatically adjustable cleaning head. 2 What type would be a good choice for asthma sufferers? Look for a vacuum cleaner that has a filter efficiency of at least 95%. This refers to the proportion of tiny dust particles that are retained in the bag or canister. It is not a measure of how efficiently it picks up dirt. 3 How important is wattage? A common misconception is that vacuum cleaners with the highest power ratings (watts) work best. Wattage relates to how much electricity is used rather than the amount of dirt sucked up. Until all manufacturers test to the same performance standards, you'll have to take our word for it. 4 Pet hairs are a constant problem in our house, so what should I look for? A cleaner with a beater bar or turbo brush will help lift pet hairs, but avoid using it on loop-pile or natural floor coverings as the beating action could damage the surface. 5 What about stairs? Cylinder cleaners are generally lighter and more compact and so easier to carry around. Look for one that is small enough or specially designed to balance well on steps or has a long flexible hose.",

      "body": "<p>This has been the best, the most upbeat and the most successful Conservative Conference in years.</p> <p>This week the people of Britain look to us to see if we are ready to be a Government.</p> <p>And with the policies we have presented and the purpose we have demonstrated, we have shown beyond doubt that we are ready for Government.</p> <p>This week the people of Britain look to us to see if we have the right team to run the country.</p> <p>And with brilliant platform speeches we have shown beyond doubt that this Shadow Cabinet, with its breadth of vision and its depth of talent, is the best team for Britain.</p> <p>The breadth of vision to help hard working families; and depth of talent too. Didn't Michael Portillo make a fantastic speech and show what a brilliant Chancellor of the Exchequer he'll be?</p> <p>The breadth of vision to preserve our independence in a flexible Europe; and the depth of talent. After years of Robin Cook wouldn't it be great to have a real Foreign Secretary like Francis Maude?</p> <p>The breadth of vision to rejuvenate our inner cities, set our schools free, help our pensioners and improve the NHS; and the depth of talent with people like Michael Ancram, Archie Norman, Theresa May, David Willetts and Dr Liam Fox ready to take up the challenge of government.</p> <p>The breadth of vision to win the war against crime; and the depth of talent that would give us a great crime-fighting Home Secretary in Ann Widdecombe.</p> <p>Our Conference has looked like a Conference for the future. Labour's looked like a Conference from the past.</p> <p>After all the years of trying to control the trade unions, it was back to beer and sandwiches in Brighton last week. Tony Blair likes beer and sandwiches without the beer. I like it without the sandwiches. Come to think of it, I like it without the unions.</p> <p>And throughout this week, we have shown the British people beyond doubt that we can win the next general election.</p> <p>Thanks to the Deputy Prime Minister we now know when that election is planned to be. Last week that political titan was asked a trick question: has Labour's disastrous performance changed your plans for an election in six month's time? John Prescott innocently replied: 'no it hasn't'.</p> <p>But even without John Prescott helping us out, we're ready for that election whenever Tony Blair now dares to call it. We're ready for it next autumn, we're ready for it next May, we're ready for it now. Go on Tony, call it now.</p> <p>We all remember the armchair critics who told us after the last election that we could not recover. Don't even bother they said, for we have entered a new world in which Tony Blair can do no wrong and New Labour will rule forever.</p> <p>But New Labour was not a philosophy, it was a fashion. And nothing is more unfashionable than a fashion that's out of fashion.</p> <p>We saw them last week, divided, arrogant and out of touch. What a bunch they are - this soap opera of a government.</p> <p>In last week's episode of the Neighbours from Hell: Robin has fallen out with Peter. Peter won't talk to Geoffrey any more. Geoffrey won't lend his holiday home to Tony. Mo has been sent to Coventry. Clare doesn't like the tent run by Tony's crony. Tony's crony blames Chris and Peter. Tony rows with Gordon. Peter won't speak to Gordon. And Gordon won't speak to anyone at all.</p> <p>Last week in Brighton the security was so tight it was Wednesday before they stabbed each other in the back.</p> <p>No Ministers in recent times have lost touch so rapidly with the people who elected them.</p> <p>When an angry pensioner sent a cheque for 75p to Gordon Brown, he cashed it.</p> <p>When Baroness Jay was asked if she understood the desperate crisis in farming, she said she knew all about it because she \"had a little cottage in the country\".</p> <p>Cocooned in Whitehall they have retreated into a world where they never have to make do with a failing school, or witness a crime, or pay for a tank of petrol.</p> <p>It is fundamental to their decline that they have betrayed and forgotten the real people of this country. And it is fundamental to our recovery that we have become the champions of the common sense instincts of the people of our country.</p> <p>And it is you, the people of this country, who do wait for hospital treatment, and do see crime on your street, and do pay for your tank of petrol, that I have in my mind as we fight the next election - It's you that I'm in it for.</p> <p>For all the people who can't afford to pay more in tax to a Government that squanders their money - I'm in it for you.</p> <p>For all the people who want classrooms where teachers can apply reasonable discipline to children without fear of ending up in court - I'm in it for you.</p> <p>For all the people who despair at the neglect and poverty and waste of human talent in our inner cities and want to do something about it - I'm in it for you.</p> <p>For all the people who think it's a scandal when a patient's throat cancer operation is cancelled four times because of political targets - I'm in it for you.</p> <p>For all the people who think that the law should be on the side of the house-owner and not the house-breaker - I'm in it for you.</p> <p>For all the people who can see that our asylum system is in chaos and want political leaders with the courage to get up and say so - I'm in it for you.</p> <p>For all the people who believe that we shouldn't be handing over more of the rights and powers of this country - I'm in it for you.</p> <p>For all the people who want to keep the Pound - I'm in it for you.</p> <p>For all the people who are sick of the spin and the waste and the lies and the cronies and the sycophants, sick of the arrogance and the high-handedness, sick of the contempt for our traditions and for our Parliament, sick of a Chancellor too out of touch to listen and of a Prime Minister too arrogant to apologise, for all those people - we are all in it for you.</p> <p>For all the people who really hoped that they had elected a Government that would deliver on its promises and have been so bitterly disappointed - we are in it for you.</p> <p>These are people who look to us to give them back their country. And we will not let them down.</p> <p>When Tony Blair declared war on the forces of Conservatism, he declared war on all these people.</p> <p>Last year, in his Conference speech, he said defeating the forces of Conservatism was his great mission for the twenty first century. Last week, nine months into the twenty first century, he didn't mention the forces of Conservatism at all.</p> <p>We really do have a Prime Minister who is prepared to say whatever will please his audience without the slightest consistent thought or principle entering his head.</p> <p>But just because he's stopped talking about the forces of Conservatism, it hasn't made us go away. Just because he's paranoid about the forces of Conservatism doesn't mean we're not out to get him.</p> <p>Because what will bring this Government down is its arrogant contempt for the views of real people.</p> <p>You know the precise moment when everyone started to see through New Labour? Midnight. December 31st last year. You probably all had a good time on New Year's Eve. Ffion and I, we went to the Dome.</p> <p>What did Tony Blair tell us about the Dome? 'I'm absolutely sure that this is going to be a startling and exhilarating success \u0085 it will be the most famous new building in the world in the year 2000'. Well he wasn't wrong about that.</p> <p>And then there was John Prescott: 'if we can't make the Dome work, we're not much of a Government'. Whatever would we do without him?</p> <p>Tony Blair told us that the Dome would be 'the first paragraph of Labour's next Election Manifesto'. What a good idea.</p> <p>In fact such a good idea that I thought I'd help him out by drafting it for him: 'Our New Labour Government, by wasting vast sums of money on something shiny and glitzy on the outside, empty and meaningless on the inside, with no understanding of our history, no vision of our future, and with so much hype followed by complete and utter failure, have successfully built the perfect monument to the way we have governed Britain for the last four years'.</p> <p>There it is, the Dome: the first paragraph of their Manifesto and the last word about their Government.</p> <p>For the real lesson is even more serious than the failure of the Dome. It is that the Prime Minister who now admits that Governments can't run visitor attractions still thinks that Governments know best how to interfere in every classroom, manage every hospital ward, regulate every business and spend everyone's money.</p> <p>You've seen how New Labour said the Dome was going to be a success, and poured your money into it, put their cronies in charge, denied there was a problem, and how at the end it was the people of this country who had to pick up the bill.</p> <p>That is New Labour. That's what they're doing to our schools. That's what they're doing to our hospitals. That's what they're doing to our police force.</p> <p>With the Dome it's taken nine months to see that these interfering busy bodies didn't know what they were doing. Don't give them five more years to prove that they don't know what they're doing with our schools and our hospitals and our police.</p> <p>Peter Mandelson said recently: something's gone seriously wrong with this Labour Government, but what is it?</p> <p>Shall we tell him?</p> <p>Tax is rising faster than anywhere in the developed world. Hospital waiting lists are up 87,000. Secondary school class sizes are bigger. Welfare bills are soaring. Crime is rising after years of falling. The transport system is at a standstill. Petrol taxes are the highest in Europe. Red tape is prolific. Waste is endemic. The bureaucracy is bloated. Political correctness is rampant. The countryside is in crisis. The cities are neglected. Our independence as a nation is being given away and the Prime Minister is spending millions of pounds trying to con us all into abolishing the Pound when we all want to keep it.</p> <p>That's what's wrong with this Government.</p> <p>Three years ago at this Conference I made a prediction. I said: 'New Labour have certainly changed politics for the time being. Their politics without conscience brought fascination to begin with. Then admiration. But next it will bring disillusion. Finally it will bring contempt'.</p> <p>We remember the fascination. We endured the admiration. We have seen the disillusion and now, like millions of our fellow citizens, we feel the contempt.</p> <p>In his speech last week, Tony Blair announced again: 'I will act'. Well, of course he will. It's all been an act. It's only ever been an act. He's the biggest actor in town.</p> <p>But no amount of acting can save him from the truth spelt out in one of those famous Downing Street memos: 'TB' - a clever disguise - 'is not believed to be real. He lacks conviction, he is all spin and presentation, he just says things to please people, not because he believes them.'</p> <p>TB spent thousands of pounds getting that advice. WH could have told him it for nothing.</p> <p>The only person in the country still stuck in the fascination stage with New Labour is the Leader of the Liberals. But of course we've witnessed the four stages of the Liberal Party too. Irrelevance, irrelevance, irrelevance, and irrelevance.</p> <p>So people now look to us. They've seen through the Labour Party and its Leader. Millions are coming to know that not only has Labour failed to deliver, but that they are never going to deliver.</p> <p>This week, and in the coming weeks, people want to know what the alternative will be. They look to us. They want to know if we're ready. They want to know what drives us, what motivates us, what we would be like in office. They want to know where we come from and where we're going to.</p> <p>And they want to know what motivates me.</p> <p>Come with me to the Rother Valley, to the heart of South Yorkshire. See Rotherham, the industrial town I was born in. Visit Wath Comprehensive, the school that gave me a chance in life.</p> <p>Come and meet the people I grew up with. Children of proud mothers who struggled with small budgets, who relied on the local health service, and who hoped for a better life for their sons and their daughters. Children of fathers who worked hard in mines and on farms and in steel works, who never knew the security of owning a home or saving for a pension, who had no choice but to live from one week's pay packet to the next.</p> <p>Those children I grew up with have families of their own now. Many are better off than their parents. They own their own home and they're saving for a pension. Their jobs are in supermarkets, in high street banks, in telephone call centres; they're nurses and teachers and self-employed builders. And the girls in my class are now juggling with all the competing pressures of being good mothers and holding down a good job.</p> <p>But these people, the children I grew up with in South Yorkshire, want the same things as their parents did. They want security and stability for themselves and their families. They want a better life for their own children.</p> <p>Don't think that because they holiday in Tenerife and not Tuscany that they don't have aspirations for a better life.</p> <p>Don't think that because they've moved to Ilkley and not Islington that their voice can be ignored.</p> <p>The people I grew up with, and millions like them, are the mainstream of our country. They are the people who motivate me.</p> <p>And I know that they have almost given up on any politician from any political party standing up for them.</p> <p>For they see their modest incomes eaten away by more taxes every time they fill up their car or tear open their pay slip, and they wonder if any politician knows what its like to raise three children on a family budget that just won't stretch any further.</p> <p>They see young thugs walking free from our courts, and they wonder if any politician knows what it's like to live on a council estate where the criminals take control after dark.</p> <p>They see the independence of the country they love cast aside, and they wonder if any politician shares their patriotism and their pride in being British.</p> <p>These people, the people I grew up with, the mainstream people of this country, are the people who motivate me.</p> <p>And these are the people we will govern for. We will govern for hard working families. We will govern for people of every community and background. We will govern for the mainstream that New Labour has ignored. We will govern for all the people.</p> <p>For when New Labour say to us that we're only appealing to core Conservative voters when we talk about crime and asylum and tax and Europe, I say to them that they have completely lost touch with the hard working families of this country.</p> <p>I say to hard-working families everywhere: I know that you are looking at our Party and judging whether we are ready for government.</p> <p>You know that we are tough on crime, and I tell you this: no government in recent times has been as tough on criminals as we will be.</p> <p>You know that we want to reduce taxes, and no government in recent times has been as committed to cutting taxes as we will be.</p> <p>You know that we believe in Britain, and no party will stand up for the rights and independence of our country with as much resolve and fortitude as we will.</p> <p>You know all this, but I want you to hear something else you may not know.</p> <p>The Conservative Party in Government will direct its energies to improving the schools that are the most hopeless, to bringing life to inner city areas that are the most bleak, to helping pensioners that are the least well off, to tackling drug problems that scar the least fortunate, to addressing family break down in the most dislocated communities, and to improving the health care for those most dependent on the NHS.</p> <p>And it is because we are ready to do all these things that the message coming loud and clear from this Conference is that we are ready for government.</p> <p>There are some who say there is a contradiction between traditional Conservative issues and winning new Tory audiences; between tolerance and mutual respect for all people, and championing the mainstream values of the country.</p> <p>There is no contradiction. I say being tough on crime, believing in lower taxes and the robust defence of our nation's independence are not in contradiction with wanting better schools and hospitals and thriving inner cities; they are an essential part of achieving all those things. I say defeating political correctness and refusing simply to accept every demand from every pressure group is not in contradiction with respecting the differences between individuals; on the contrary, the championing of mainstream values is the championing of tolerance, mutual respect and the rich diversity of our country.</p> <p>Only by trusting the instincts and the individuals and the institutions and the independence of the people of this country can we hope to seize the opportunity that this Government is so tragically squandering.</p> <p>That's why we're going to lead a Common Sense Revolution.</p> <p>That's why we're going to govern for the hard working, hard pressed, decent law abiding people of this country and bring an end to the rule of the small out-of-touch New Labour clique that thinks it is so much better than the rest of us.</p> <p>We're going to govern for the families who've earned every penny they've got and need every penny they earn and want a Government that will cut taxes.</p> <p>Three weeks ago we experienced something in this country we hadn't seen for more than 20 years. The pumps ran out of petrol, the shops ran out of bread, and the country came to a standstill. Labour governments, don't you just love 'em?</p> <p>Tony Blair and his Government say we mustn't give in to pickets.</p> <p>What a nice little lecture from the same Labour politicians who led the seamans' strike and encouraged the miner's strike and supported the secondary pickets.</p> <p>If he'd really been listening, he'd never have introduced his stealth taxes and he'd never have had blockades and he'd never have had the vast majority of the people of this country join in a taxpayers' revolt.</p> <p>Well if they don't understand the taxpayers revolt, we do. If he's not in sympathy with it, we are. And if he won't cut taxes, we will.</p> <p>This Government has contempt for those who want low taxes. They think that wanting lower taxes is selfish and greedy.</p> <p>Wanting to pay less tax isn't greedy. The truck driver who told me how he had to work day and night and sleep in his cab just to feed a family he scarcely got to see wasn't being greedy.</p> <p>He was just desperate and angry to see that hard earned money he'd scraped together disappear in stealth taxes.</p> <p>And I tell him now that the Conservative Party understands the life he's living and we see his desperation and we share his anger and we will govern for him.</p> <p>Wanting to pay less tax isn't greedy. The young software consultant that I met who shook his head as he talked of his plans to move abroad because of the stealth taxes he now faces wasn't being greedy.</p> <p>He just can't understand how this country can ever succeed if he's being taxed out of work in an era when business can go anywhere in the world and we need innovators so badly.</p> <p>And I tell him now that the Conservative Party can see the damage being done to the economic future of our country and we see our talent going abroad and we share his belief that our country cannot afford it and we will govern for him.</p> <p>Wanting to pay less tax isn't greedy. The countless hard working families whom I meet everywhere I go who talk of how difficult they find it to save money and keep their families together and live on just one income while bringing up children aren't being greedy.</p> <p>They just feel betrayed by a Government that promised no tax increases at all.</p> <p>And I tell them now that the Conservative Party understands their sense of betrayal and we know how difficult high taxes have made their lives and we are on their side - and we will govern for them.</p> <p>All these people are looking to the Conservatives now and they want to know what we're going to do for them.</p> <p>We know what we're going to do for them.</p> <p>We're going to cut fuel tax. Three pence off a litre of petrol. Three pence off a litre of diesel.</p> <p>We're going to restore a married couples allowance - because I believe marriage is the bedrock of a secure and stable society.</p> <p>We're going to bring an end to the era of stealth taxes and start cutting the taxes paid by hard pressed families.</p> <p>And we know how we're going to pay for it too.</p> <p>We're going to make sure billions of pounds in surplus taxes raised by Gordon Brown goes back to taxpayers who earned it.</p> <p>We're going to reform the welfare system so that we stop losing billions of pounds in fraud and so that those who can work must work.</p> <p>We're going to stop wasting money on worthless Government schemes that are only designed to win headlines for Tony Blair.</p> <p>We're going to reduce the number of Ministers, cut the size of the House of Commons, halve the number of political advisers and cut the whole size of Whitehall so that there aren't so many politicians going around dreaming up expensive meddling schemes to interfere in everybody else's lives.</p> <p>Tony Blair may think his made-up numbers about Tory cuts will win him back a few votes. He couldn't be more wrong. People don't believe the phoney statistics and falsehoods he tells about his own policies and so they certainly won't believe the phoney statistics and falsehoods he tells about ours.</p> <p>The British people know we can have lower taxes and better public services if we spend wisely. They know it can be done.</p> <p>And we're going to do it.</p> <p>For we're ready to govern for all the people.</p> <p>We're going to govern for the parents who want their children to get the best chance in life, who want a Government that will deliver on education.</p> <p>Last week I visited the largest comprehensive school in Birmingham. And the reporters said to me - \"There's a grammar school nearby, why didn't you visit that?\"</p> <p>And I said \"I've visited grammar schools and they do a superb job. But our task now is to raise standards for that vast majority of parents and pupils who haven't got a grammar school to choose from.\"</p> <p>So I've been going to the inner city schools and talking to the pupils and the parents and the teachers.</p> <p>I've been hearing the pupils talk about their hopes and their dreams and how determined they are to better themselves:</p> <p>parents talk of how they want the right to choose the best schools for their children but feel that choice is denied to them;</p> <p>teachers talk of how frustrated they are to spend so much time filling in forms and how difficult they find it keeping discipline when the Government tries to stop them excluding troublemakers;</p> <p>head-teachers talk of the money that gets wasted on bureaucracy when it could be spent improving our schools.</p> <p>It's time someone listened to these people. The Conservative Party is listening to these people and I am determined that we will govern for them.</p> <p>All these people are looking to the Conservatives now and they want to know what we're going to do for them.</p> <p>We know what we're going to do for them.</p> <p>We're going to take the money that's spent by politicians and bureaucrats and let the schools spend it instead. \u00a3540 for every pupil.</p> <p>We're going to endow our universities and set them free to be the best in the world.</p> <p>We're going to create Free Schools that can determine their own ethos and decide their own admissions policy and set their own pay policy.</p> <p>We're going to have tougher discipline in our schools because we're going to end the ridiculous situation where schools are penalised by the Government when they exclude pupils and are forced by politicians to take back those who disrupt classrooms. This is a policy that undermines discipline and makes teachers lives impossible and it's going to stop.</p> <p>The British people know these things can be done.</p> <p>And we're going to do them.</p> <p>For we're ready to govern for all the people.</p> <p>We're going to govern for the people who rely on the state pension and the National Health Service and think everyone should share in the growing prosperity of our country.</p> <p>The Government seems confused at why pensioners are angry. But the reason is simple.</p> <p>Pensioners don't like being treated with contempt by people like the Chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party who said they were all \"racists\".</p> <p>They don't like being talked down to by people like Peter Mandelson who said that they're not worth bothering with because they're not 'aspirational'.</p> <p>I reject this language. Our pensioners should be treated with dignity and respect.</p> <p>And they don't like being treated as charity cases by a Chancellor of the Exchequer who prefers to go on handing out means tested benefits and one off gimmicks because he thinks he knows best.</p> <p>Labour has not governed for them. We will govern for them.</p> <p>All these people are looking to the Conservatives now and they want to know what we're going to do for them.</p> <p>We know what we're going to do for them.</p> <p>We're going to take Gordon Brown's gimmicks and the administrative costs wasted on them and put that money back into the basic state pension. \u00a35.50 more a week for every pensioner; \u00a310 for an older pensioner couple.</p> <p>We're going to match Labour penny for penny on the NHS and sweep away Labour's dogmatic opposition to private provision.</p> <p>We're going to make sure every penny is spent on clinical priorities rather than the political priorities of Labour politicians.</p> <p>We're going to give every young person in the country the chance to have a pension of their own far greater than the current state pension.</p> <p>The British people know these things can be done.</p> <p>And we're going to do them.</p> <p>For we're ready to govern for all the people.</p> <p>We're going to govern for the law abiding people of this country who have sometimes felt there wasn't a politician left prepared to champion their common sense values and instincts.</p> <p>It's time we halted the march of political correctness.</p> <p>Can you believe that Birmingham's Labour Council decided to rename Christmas 'the Winterval'?</p> <p>Can you believe that Education Ministers supported a ban on musical chairs because they think the game encourages aggression?</p> <p>Can you believe that they used Number 10 Downing Street to hold a summit on how many thin and fat people should appear on television?</p> <p>I want all these people who despair of this politically correct idiocy to know that we're going to govern for them.</p> <p>I want all the parents who think schools should respect their values and don't want Section 28 abolished to know that we're going to govern for them.</p> <p>I want all the people who are angry at the way our asylum system is in chaos and just want enforcement of the rules - I want them to know that we're going to govern for them.</p> <p>But nothing angers or frustrates the law abiding people of this country more than the failure of this Government to get a grip on rising crime.</p> <p>Like the group of black teenagers I met in a Lambeth comprehensive four months ago.

      "bodyText": "This has been the best, the most upbeat and the most successful Conservative Conference in years. This week the people of Britain look to us to see if we are ready to be a Government. And with the policies we have presented and the purpose we have demonstrated, we have shown beyond doubt that we are ready for Government. This week the people of Britain look to us to see if we have the right team to run the country. And with brilliant platform speeches we have shown beyond doubt that this Shadow Cabinet, with its breadth of vision and its depth of talent, is the best team for Britain. The breadth of vision to help hard working families; and depth of talent too. Didn't Michael Portillo make a fantastic speech and show what a brilliant Chancellor of the Exchequer he'll be? The breadth of vision to preserve our independence in a flexible Europe; and the depth of talent. After years of Robin Cook wouldn't it be great to have a real Foreign Secretary like Francis Maude? The breadth of vision to rejuvenate our inner cities, set our schools free, help our pensioners and improve the NHS; and the depth of talent with people like Michael Ancram, Archie Norman, Theresa May, David Willetts and Dr Liam Fox ready to take up the challenge of government. The breadth of vision to win the war against crime; and the depth of talent that would give us a great crime-fighting Home Secretary in Ann Widdecombe. Our Conference has looked like a Conference for the future. Labour's looked like a Conference from the past. After all the years of trying to control the trade unions, it was back to beer and sandwiches in Brighton last week. Tony Blair likes beer and sandwiches without the beer. I like it without the sandwiches. Come to think of it, I like it without the unions. And throughout this week, we have shown the British people beyond doubt that we can win the next general election. Thanks to the Deputy Prime Minister we now know when that election is planned to be. Last week that political titan was asked a trick question: has Labour's disastrous performance changed your plans for an election in six month's time? John Prescott innocently replied: 'no it hasn't'. But even without John Prescott helping us out, we're ready for that election whenever Tony Blair now dares to call it. We're ready for it next autumn, we're ready for it next May, we're ready for it now. Go on Tony, call it now. We all remember the armchair critics who told us after the last election that we could not recover. Don't even bother they said, for we have entered a new world in which Tony Blair can do no wrong and New Labour will rule forever. But New Labour was not a philosophy, it was a fashion. And nothing is more unfashionable than a fashion that's out of fashion. We saw them last week, divided, arrogant and out of touch. What a bunch they are - this soap opera of a government. In last week's episode of the Neighbours from Hell: Robin has fallen out with Peter. Peter won't talk to Geoffrey any more. Geoffrey won't lend his holiday home to Tony. Mo has been sent to Coventry. Clare doesn't like the tent run by Tony's crony. Tony's crony blames Chris and Peter. Tony rows with Gordon. Peter won't speak to Gordon. And Gordon won't speak to anyone at all. Last week in Brighton the security was so tight it was Wednesday before they stabbed each other in the back. No Ministers in recent times have lost touch so rapidly with the people who elected them. When an angry pensioner sent a cheque for 75p to Gordon Brown, he cashed it. When Baroness Jay was asked if she understood the desperate crisis in farming, she said she knew all about it because she \"had a little cottage in the country\". Cocooned in Whitehall they have retreated into a world where they never have to make do with a failing school, or witness a crime, or pay for a tank of petrol. It is fundamental to their decline that they have betrayed and forgotten the real people of this country. And it is fundamental to our recovery that we have become the champions of the common sense instincts of the people of our country. And it is you, the people of this country, who do wait for hospital treatment, and do see crime on your street, and do pay for your tank of petrol, that I have in my mind as we fight the next election - It's you that I'm in it for. For all the people who can't afford to pay more in tax to a Government that squanders their money - I'm in it for you. For all the people who want classrooms where teachers can apply reasonable discipline to children without fear of ending up in court - I'm in it for you. For all the people who despair at the neglect and poverty and waste of human talent in our inner cities and want to do something about it - I'm in it for you. For all the people who think it's a scandal when a patient's throat cancer operation is cancelled four times because of political targets - I'm in it for you. For all the people who think that the law should be on the side of the house-owner and not the house-breaker - I'm in it for you. For all the people who can see that our asylum system is in chaos and want political leaders with the courage to get up and say so - I'm in it for you. For all the people who believe that we shouldn't be handing over more of the rights and powers of this country - I'm in it for you. For all the people who want to keep the Pound - I'm in it for you. For all the people who are sick of the spin and the waste and the lies and the cronies and the sycophants, sick of the arrogance and the high-handedness, sick of the contempt for our traditions and for our Parliament, sick of a Chancellor too out of touch to listen and of a Prime Minister too arrogant to apologise, for all those people - we are all in it for you. For all the people who really hoped that they had elected a Government that would deliver on its promises and have been so bitterly disappointed - we are in it for you. These are people who look to us to give them back their country. And we will not let them down. When Tony Blair declared war on the forces of Conservatism, he declared war on all these people. Last year, in his Conference speech, he said defeating the forces of Conservatism was his great mission for the twenty first century. Last week, nine months into the twenty first century, he didn't mention the forces of Conservatism at all. We really do have a Prime Minister who is prepared to say whatever will please his audience without the slightest consistent thought or principle entering his head. But just because he's stopped talking about the forces of Conservatism, it hasn't made us go away. Just because he's paranoid about the forces of Conservatism doesn't mean we're not out to get him. Because what will bring this Government down is its arrogant contempt for the views of real people. You know the precise moment when everyone started to see through New Labour? Midnight. December 31st last year. You probably all had a good time on New Year's Eve. Ffion and I, we went to the Dome. What did Tony Blair tell us about the Dome? 'I'm absolutely sure that this is going to be a startling and exhilarating success \u0085 it will be the most famous new building in the world in the year 2000'. Well he wasn't wrong about that. And then there was John Prescott: 'if we can't make the Dome work, we're not much of a Government'. Whatever would we do without him? Tony Blair told us that the Dome would be 'the first paragraph of Labour's next Election Manifesto'. What a good idea. In fact such a good idea that I thought I'd help him out by drafting it for him: 'Our New Labour Government, by wasting vast sums of money on something shiny and glitzy on the outside, empty and meaningless on the inside, with no understanding of our history, no vision of our future, and with so much hype followed by complete and utter failure, have successfully built the perfect monument to the way we have governed Britain for the last four years'. There it is, the Dome: the first paragraph of their Manifesto and the last word about their Government. For the real lesson is even more serious than the failure of the Dome. It is that the Prime Minister who now admits that Governments can't run visitor attractions still thinks that Governments know best how to interfere in every classroom, manage every hospital ward, regulate every business and spend everyone's money. You've seen how New Labour said the Dome was going to be a success, and poured your money into it, put their cronies in charge, denied there was a problem, and how at the end it was the people of this country who had to pick up the bill. That is New Labour. That's what they're doing to our schools. That's what they're doing to our hospitals. That's what they're doing to our police force. With the Dome it's taken nine months to see that these interfering busy bodies didn't know what they were doing. Don't give them five more years to prove that they don't know what they're doing with our schools and our hospitals and our police. Peter Mandelson said recently: something's gone seriously wrong with this Labour Government, but what is it? Shall we tell him? Tax is rising faster than anywhere in the developed world. Hospital waiting lists are up 87,000. Secondary school class sizes are bigger. Welfare bills are soaring. Crime is rising after years of falling. The transport system is at a standstill. Petrol taxes are the highest in Europe. Red tape is prolific. Waste is endemic. The bureaucracy is bloated. Political correctness is rampant. The countryside is in crisis. The cities are neglected. Our independence as a nation is being given away and the Prime Minister is spending millions of pounds trying to con us all into abolishing the Pound when we all want to keep it. That's what's wrong with this Government. Three years ago at this Conference I made a prediction. I said: 'New Labour have certainly changed politics for the time being. Their politics without conscience brought fascination to begin with. Then admiration. But next it will bring disillusion. Finally it will bring contempt'. We remember the fascination. We endured the admiration. We have seen the disillusion and now, like millions of our fellow citizens, we feel the contempt. In his speech last week, Tony Blair announced again: 'I will act'. Well, of course he will. It's all been an act. It's only ever been an act. He's the biggest actor in town. But no amount of acting can save him from the truth spelt out in one of those famous Downing Street memos: 'TB' - a clever disguise - 'is not believed to be real. He lacks conviction, he is all spin and presentation, he just says things to please people, not because he believes them.' TB spent thousands of pounds getting that advice. WH could have told him it for nothing. The only person in the country still stuck in the fascination stage with New Labour is the Leader of the Liberals. But of course we've witnessed the four stages of the Liberal Party too. Irrelevance, irrelevance, irrelevance, and irrelevance. So people now look to us. They've seen through the Labour Party and its Leader. Millions are coming to know that not only has Labour failed to deliver, but that they are never going to deliver. This week, and in the coming weeks, people want to know what the alternative will be. They look to us. They want to know if we're ready. They want to know what drives us, what motivates us, what we would be like in office. They want to know where we come from and where we're going to. And they want to know what motivates me. Come with me to the Rother Valley, to the heart of South Yorkshire. See Rotherham, the industrial town I was born in. Visit Wath Comprehensive, the school that gave me a chance in life. Come and meet the people I grew up with. Children of proud mothers who struggled with small budgets, who relied on the local health service, and who hoped for a better life for their sons and their daughters. Children of fathers who worked hard in mines and on farms and in steel works, who never knew the security of owning a home or saving for a pension, who had no choice but to live from one week's pay packet to the next. Those children I grew up with have families of their own now. Many are better off than their parents. They own their own home and they're saving for a pension. Their jobs are in supermarkets, in high street banks, in telephone call centres; they're nurses and teachers and self-employed builders. And the girls in my class are now juggling with all the competing pressures of being good mothers and holding down a good job. But these people, the children I grew up with in South Yorkshire, want the same things as their parents did. They want security and stability for themselves and their families. They want a better life for their own children. Don't think that because they holiday in Tenerife and not Tuscany that they don't have aspirations for a better life. Don't think that because they've moved to Ilkley and not Islington that their voice can be ignored. The people I grew up with, and millions like them, are the mainstream of our country. They are the people who motivate me. And I know that they have almost given up on any politician from any political party standing up for them. For they see their modest incomes eaten away by more taxes every time they fill up their car or tear open their pay slip, and they wonder if any politician knows what its like to raise three children on a family budget that just won't stretch any further. They see young thugs walking free from our courts, and they wonder if any politician knows what it's like to live on a council estate where the criminals take control after dark. They see the independence of the country they love cast aside, and they wonder if any politician shares their patriotism and their pride in being British. These people, the people I grew up with, the mainstream people of this country, are the people who motivate me. And these are the people we will govern for. We will govern for hard working families. We will govern for people of every community and background. We will govern for the mainstream that New Labour has ignored. We will govern for all the people. For when New Labour say to us that we're only appealing to core Conservative voters when we talk about crime and asylum and tax and Europe, I say to them that they have completely lost touch with the hard working families of this country. I say to hard-working families everywhere: I know that you are looking at our Party and judging whether we are ready for government. You know that we are tough on crime, and I tell you this: no government in recent times has been as tough on criminals as we will be. You know that we want to reduce taxes, and no government in recent times has been as committed to cutting taxes as we will be. You know that we believe in Britain, and no party will stand up for the rights and independence of our country with as much resolve and fortitude as we will. You know all this, but I want you to hear something else you may not know. The Conservative Party in Government will direct its energies to improving the schools that are the most hopeless, to bringing life to inner city areas that are the most bleak, to helping pensioners that are the least well off, to tackling drug problems that scar the least fortunate, to addressing family break down in the most dislocated communities, and to improving the health care for those most dependent on the NHS. And it is because we are ready to do all these things that the message coming loud and clear from this Conference is that we are ready for government. There are some who say there is a contradiction between traditional Conservative issues and winning new Tory audiences; between tolerance and mutual respect for all people, and championing the mainstream values of the country. There is no contradiction. I say being tough on crime, believing in lower taxes and the robust defence of our nation's independence are not in contradiction with wanting better schools and hospitals and thriving inner cities; they are an essential part of achieving all those things. I say defeating political correctness and refusing simply to accept every demand from every pressure group is not in contradiction with respecting the differences between individuals; on the contrary, the championing of mainstream values is the championing of tolerance, mutual respect and the rich diversity of our country. Only by trusting the instincts and the individuals and the institutions and the independence of the people of this country can we hope to seize the opportunity that this Government is so tragically squandering. That's why we're going to lead a Common Sense Revolution. That's why we're going to govern for the hard working, hard pressed, decent law abiding people of this country and bring an end to the rule of the small out-of-touch New Labour clique that thinks it is so much better than the rest of us. We're going to govern for the families who've earned every penny they've got and need every penny they earn and want a Government that will cut taxes. Three weeks ago we experienced something in this country we hadn't seen for more than 20 years. The pumps ran out of petrol, the shops ran out of bread, and the country came to a standstill. Labour governments, don't you just love 'em? Tony Blair and his Government say we mustn't give in to pickets. What a nice little lecture from the same Labour politicians who led the seamans' strike and encouraged the miner's strike and supported the secondary pickets. If he'd really been listening, he'd never have introduced his stealth taxes and he'd never have had blockades and he'd never have had the vast majority of the people of this country join in a taxpayers' revolt. Well if they don't understand the taxpayers revolt, we do. If he's not in sympathy with it, we are. And if he won't cut taxes, we will. This Government has contempt for those who want low taxes. They think that wanting lower taxes is selfish and greedy. Wanting to pay less tax isn't greedy. The truck driver who told me how he had to work day and night and sleep in his cab just to feed a family he scarcely got to see wasn't being greedy. He was just desperate and angry to see that hard earned money he'd scraped together disappear in stealth taxes. And I tell him now that the Conservative Party understands the life he's living and we see his desperation and we share his anger and we will govern for him. Wanting to pay less tax isn't greedy. The young software consultant that I met who shook his head as he talked of his plans to move abroad because of the stealth taxes he now faces wasn't being greedy. He just can't understand how this country can ever succeed if he's being taxed out of work in an era when business can go anywhere in the world and we need innovators so badly. And I tell him now that the Conservative Party can see the damage being done to the economic future of our country and we see our talent going abroad and we share his belief that our country cannot afford it and we will govern for him. Wanting to pay less tax isn't greedy. The countless hard working families whom I meet everywhere I go who talk of how difficult they find it to save money and keep their families together and live on just one income while bringing up children aren't being greedy. They just feel betrayed by a Government that promised no tax increases at all. And I tell them now that the Conservative Party understands their sense of betrayal and we know how difficult high taxes have made their lives and we are on their side - and we will govern for them. All these people are looking to the Conservatives now and they want to know what we're going to do for them. We know what we're going to do for them. We're going to cut fuel tax. Three pence off a litre of petrol. Three pence off a litre of diesel. We're going to restore a married couples allowance - because I believe marriage is the bedrock of a secure and stable society. We're going to bring an end to the era of stealth taxes and start cutting the taxes paid by hard pressed families. And we know how we're going to pay for it too. We're going to make sure billions of pounds in surplus taxes raised by Gordon Brown goes back to taxpayers who earned it. We're going to reform the welfare system so that we stop losing billions of pounds in fraud and so that those who can work must work. We're going to stop wasting money on worthless Government schemes that are only designed to win headlines for Tony Blair. We're going to reduce the number of Ministers, cut the size of the House of Commons, halve the number of political advisers and cut the whole size of Whitehall so that there aren't so many politicians going around dreaming up expensive meddling schemes to interfere in everybody else's lives. Tony Blair may think his made-up numbers about Tory cuts will win him back a few votes. He couldn't be more wrong. People don't believe the phoney statistics and falsehoods he tells about his own policies and so they certainly won't believe the phoney statistics and falsehoods he tells about ours. The British people know we can have lower taxes and better public services if we spend wisely. They know it can be done. And we're going to do it. For we're ready to govern for all the people. We're going to govern for the parents who want their children to get the best chance in life, who want a Government that will deliver on education. Last week I visited the largest comprehensive school in Birmingham. And the reporters said to me - \"There's a grammar school nearby, why didn't you visit that?\" And I said \"I've visited grammar schools and they do a superb job. But our task now is to raise standards for that vast majority of parents and pupils who haven't got a grammar school to choose from.\" So I've been going to the inner city schools and talking to the pupils and the parents and the teachers. I've been hearing the pupils talk about their hopes and their dreams and how determined they are to better themselves: parents talk of how they want the right to choose the best schools for their children but feel that choice is denied to them; teachers talk of how frustrated they are to spend so much time filling in forms and how difficult they find it keeping discipline when the Government tries to stop them excluding troublemakers; head-teachers talk of the money that gets wasted on bureaucracy when it could be spent improving our schools. It's time someone listened to these people. The Conservative Party is listening to these people and I am determined that we will govern for them. All these people are looking to the Conservatives now and they want to know what we're going to do for them. We know what we're going to do for them. We're going to take the money that's spent by politicians and bureaucrats and let the schools spend it instead. \u00a3540 for every pupil. We're going to endow our universities and set them free to be the best in the world. We're going to create Free Schools that can determine their own ethos and decide their own admissions policy and set their own pay policy. We're going to have tougher discipline in our schools because we're going to end the ridiculous situation where schools are penalised by the Government when they exclude pupils and are forced by politicians to take back those who disrupt classrooms. This is a policy that undermines discipline and makes teachers lives impossible and it's going to stop. The British people know these things can be done. And we're going to do them. For we're ready to govern for all the people. We're going to govern for the people who rely on the state pension and the National Health Service and think everyone should share in the growing prosperity of our country. The Government seems confused at why pensioners are angry. But the reason is simple. Pensioners don't like being treated with contempt by people like the Chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party who said they were all \"racists\". They don't like being talked down to by people like Peter Mandelson who said that they're not worth bothering with because they're not 'aspirational'. I reject this language. Our pensioners should be treated with dignity and respect. And they don't like being treated as charity cases by a Chancellor of the Exchequer who prefers to go on handing out means tested benefits and one off gimmicks because he thinks he knows best. Labour has not governed for them. We will govern for them. All these people are looking to the Conservatives now and they want to know what we're going to do for them. We know what we're going to do for them. We're going to take Gordon Brown's gimmicks and the administrative costs wasted on them and put that money back into the basic state pension. \u00a35.50 more a week for every pensioner; \u00a310 for an older pensioner couple. We're going to match Labour penny for penny on the NHS and sweep away Labour's dogmatic opposition to private provision. We're going to make sure every penny is spent on clinical priorities rather than the political priorities of Labour politicians. We're going to give every young person in the country the chance to have a pension of their own far greater than the current state pension. The British people know these things can be done. And we're going to do them. For we're ready to govern for all the people. We're going to govern for the law abiding people of this country who have sometimes felt there wasn't a politician left prepared to champion their common sense values and instincts. It's time we halted the march of political correctness. Can you believe that Birmingham's Labour Council decided to rename Christmas 'the Winterval'? Can you believe that Education Ministers supported a ban on musical chairs because they think the game encourages aggression? Can you believe that they used Number 10 Downing Street to hold a summit on how many thin and fat people should appear on television? I want all these people who despair of this politically correct idiocy to know that we're going to govern for them. I want all the parents who think schools should respect their values and don't want Section 28 abolished to know that we're going to govern for them. I want all the people who are angry at the way our asylum system is in chaos and just want enforcement of the rules - I want them to know that we're going to govern for them. But nothing angers or frustrates the law abiding people of this country more than the failure of this Government to get a grip on rising crime. Like the group of black teenagers I met in a Lambeth comprehensive four months ago. We got around a table in their classroom, and do you know what they said to me? 'The police have got their hands tied and they've lost it. Crime is rising and we're most likely to be the victims'. These people are looking to the Conservatives now and they want to know what we're going to do for them. We know what we're going to do for them. We're going to restore Labour's cuts in our police force. And we're going to stop tying their hands with red tape and politically correct nonsense. We're going to have less PC and more PCs. We're going to have no more of Labour's early release schemes for rapists and burglars and muggers. We're going to overhaul the law to make sure that it is on the side of the people defending their homes instead of the criminals breaking into those homes. We're going to step up the war against drugs, not surrender to the drug dealers. We're going to make sure that prisoners don't idle around in their cells but do a full working day. We are going to give full force to the common sense instincts of the British people and we're going to win the war against crime. The British people know these things can be done. And we're going to do it. For we're ready to govern for all the people. And we're ready to govern for all parts of the country. Click here to read remainder of speech",

      "body": "<p>Earlier this year, I went to inner city housing estates in London and the north of England</p> <p>I saw there how too many of their schools are failing, there aren't enough jobs available, the shops have gone, and the sprawling tower blocks are rabbit warrens for crime. It's the same story in many of our cities.</p> <p>The people who live on these council estates have never looked to the Conservative Party for support, but I believe passionately that we still have a duty to help them.</p> <p>We are going to reclaim their streets from the drug dealers and car thieves.</p> <p>We are going to bulldoze the worst of the concrete tower blocks and ensure that there are new low rise homes where the criminals won't be welcome.</p> <p>And by bringing life back to our inner cities, we will ease the relentless pressure of the developers on our countryside.</p> <p>Only the most out of touch, metropolitan elite could regard the attack on our rural life and the desperate plight of our farmers as a source of amusement. Yet, in speech after speech, and joke after joke in Brighton last week, New Labour poked fun at the anger and hardship of the people of the countryside.</p> <p>This Government thinks it is attacking only a small rural minority. In fact it is attacking the values of tolerance and respect, the values of the mainstream majority.</p> <p>Rural people look to the Conservative Party to represent them and stand up for their way of life - and we will not let them down.</p> <p>For we are ready to govern for all parts of the country - and by country I mean the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.</p> <p>But a Conservative Government will only be able to do all of these things, and govern for all the people, if we still have a country left to govern at all.</p> <p>For this Labour Government is taking us down the road to a European superstate.</p> <p>Britain is uniquely placed to take advantage of the opportunities of the twenty-first century.</p> <p>We have a unique relationship with the United States, a unique relationship with Europe and a unique relationship with the Commonwealth.</p> <p>Our language is the global language of the new economy.</p> <p>It seems to me to be blindingly obvious and basic common sense that with so many opportunities opening before us, we should not hesitate to make the most of being British.</p> <p>And the advantages of independence seem to have been blindingly obvious to the Danes too.</p> <p>The result of the Danish referendum last week has once and for all demolished Labour's bogus arguments and scare tactics.</p> <p>In a Europe where so many decisions are taken by bureaucratic elites, we should be celebrating the fact that at least in one country the people have spoken.</p> <p>It now gives us a renewed opportunity to press the case for a different kind of Europe.</p> <p>Now we must champion the cause of a flexible, free trading, low tax, lightly regulated Europe.

      "bodyText": "Earlier this year, I went to inner city housing estates in London and the north of England I saw there how too many of their schools are failing, there aren't enough jobs available, the shops have gone, and the sprawling tower blocks are rabbit warrens for crime. It's the same story in many of our cities. The people who live on these council estates have never looked to the Conservative Party for support, but I believe passionately that we still have a duty to help them. We are going to reclaim their streets from the drug dealers and car thieves. We are going to bulldoze the worst of the concrete tower blocks and ensure that there are new low rise homes where the criminals won't be welcome. And by bringing life back to our inner cities, we will ease the relentless pressure of the developers on our countryside. Only the most out of touch, metropolitan elite could regard the attack on our rural life and the desperate plight of our farmers as a source of amusement. Yet, in speech after speech, and joke after joke in Brighton last week, New Labour poked fun at the anger and hardship of the people of the countryside. This Government thinks it is attacking only a small rural minority. In fact it is attacking the values of tolerance and respect, the values of the mainstream majority. Rural people look to the Conservative Party to represent them and stand up for their way of life - and we will not let them down. For we are ready to govern for all parts of the country - and by country I mean the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. But a Conservative Government will only be able to do all of these things, and govern for all the people, if we still have a country left to govern at all. For this Labour Government is taking us down the road to a European superstate. Britain is uniquely placed to take advantage of the opportunities of the twenty-first century. We have a unique relationship with the United States, a unique relationship with Europe and a unique relationship with the Commonwealth. Our language is the global language of the new economy. It seems to me to be blindingly obvious and basic common sense that with so many opportunities opening before us, we should not hesitate to make the most of being British. And the advantages of independence seem to have been blindingly obvious to the Danes too. The result of the Danish referendum last week has once and for all demolished Labour's bogus arguments and scare tactics. In a Europe where so many decisions are taken by bureaucratic elites, we should be celebrating the fact that at least in one country the people have spoken. It now gives us a renewed opportunity to press the case for a different kind of Europe. Now we must champion the cause of a flexible, free trading, low tax, lightly regulated Europe. A Europe that goes with the grain of the new global economy, in which nations combine in different combinations for different purposes to different extents. We will be the champions of that flexible Europe. And we will be the champions of Britain's right to govern itself. For we believe in being in Europe not run by Europe. So we will write into the law of our land the powers and rights that we hold today and which we will pass to the next generation, so that no stroke of a pen from Brussels, or retrospective court judgement, can take those rights away. And we will champion the common sense instincts of young people who know that the idea of creating artificial, centralised supra-national superstates is an idea left behind in the twentieth century as they plan their lives in the twenty-first. They too believe passionately that we should be making the most of being British. So I say to them, whatever else you might have thought about the Conservative Party and what we've done for Britain, it is only by coming with us that you can make sure that there will still be a Britain. Making the most of being British means that if taxes are lower in Britain than elsewhere in Europe we should be making them lower still to ensure that we keep our competitive advantages. Making the most of being British means that if our regulations are lighter than in Europe they should be lighter still for British businesses. And making the most of being British means that if other countries give up their currencies and take on the job of applying one set of rules to every economy across Europe, we should say: good luck, we wish them well, but we will keep our Pound. At the coming election, we will be the only Party committed to keeping the Pound, just as we will be the only Party committed to common sense on the countryside and on our inner cities, on crime, on education, on pensions, on health and on tax. As we approach this election, conscious of our responsibility to provide a new government, clear in our principles for which only we can stand, resolved in our purpose to serve the people of our country, we know who we are and what we promise to be. I don't promise the earth. I don't think we'll solve every problem. I don't think we'll avoid every mistake. I won't try to start new fads or fashions. I won't claim to be creating a new era. I just want to govern with the common sense instincts of the people of this country. I just want to govern with the common sense instincts of a proud people who believe in Britain. In place of squandered opportunity and high taxation, the determination to seize the opportunity of a new economy. In place of dogmatic interference and Whitehall knows best, the certain belief in the freedom of people to make their own choices about their schools and hospitals. In place of political correctness and the noise of the pressure group, the quiet trust in the tolerance and mutual respect of the British people. In place of fear on our streets and the menace of drugs, the absolute conviction that the war against crime can be won. In place of the cringeing surrender of our rights as a country, the confident assertion of our right to be a nation. I just want to govern with the common sense instincts of a people that believes in Britain and its values and institutions. I just want to bring to a people so deeply disillusioned by its Government, A Party that understands their concerns. A Party that shares their values. A Government that believes in our country. A Conservative Government, ready to govern for all the people.",

Why is the go-getting computer industry so married to this most cheerless of liveries? </p> <p>Granted, the Apple designers are offering us a collection of candy coloured iMacs, and the G3 looks splendidly reminiscent of a Bondi-blue jellyfish. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Nokia and others offer a chance to stand out ever so slightly from the herd with customisable press on covers for handsets. But what are we to do if plastic covers, or Macs or their operating system are not to your taste? </p> <p>The answer is: call in the decorators. An increasing number of artists and companies are now offering to customise stuff that has being crying out for ornament and a touch of individuality. </p> <p>One such company, <a href=\"http://www.Art-tek.co.uk\">Art-tek.co.uk</a>, offers a service to transform just about anything, from computer mice to laptops, into a gleaming, lacquered objet d'art using the honed skills of Japanese lacquerware artists. </p> <p>\"We think hardware should be a visual feast, coolly tactile and reflect the owners personality just like desktop designs do,\" says lacquer artist Susumu Okawa. \"So at Art-tek we enjoy turning the mundane into a highly personal work of art. Something emblematic.\" </p> <p>Art-tek's work is the logical extension of the success of the configure-it-yourself PC offers of Gateway and Dell and reflects the fact that many more PCs are becoming part of the furniture as PCs move into the home and should look just as good. The company takes com missions to decorate handsets and hardware in any way its clients desire, charging from \u00a390 for a simple lacquered mouse to hundreds more for a whole PC. </p> <p>It is no accident that Art-tek uses Japanese lacquer techniques. Much of the decorated technology available takes its cue from Japan. A combined love of decorative arts and technology is very much alive there and several companies exist to bring boring computer boxes to life. </p> <p>Akira Sudo's Custom Paint Computers in Tokyo specialises in decorating Macs and PDAs. (See <a href=\"http://www.jd-net.com/WM/\">www.jd-net.com/WM</a>) The hand held devices it treats are particularly attractive - echoing the Japanese tradition of the lacquered box. \"We use a special paint used by Japanese auto-repair shop which makes it particularly tough and gives our work that shell-like metallic finish,\" says Sudo. </p> <p>For tarting up a Palm, for example, the company charges \u00a395. A small price to pay, perhaps, for the ultimate in self expression. </p> <p>Rather more expensive, but perhaps more convertible if you happen to be a fashion victim, are the one-off mobile handset covers being auctioned by Nokia, who commissioned top international fashion designers to create phone covers in support of the Aids charity London Lighthouse. These unique Xpress covers will be auctioned through online auction house QXL.com from 13-27 October (register for this at <a href=\"http://www.london-lighthouse.org.uk\">www.london-lighthouse.org.uk</a>). </p> <p>The company that makes the Xpress covers for Nokia, X-art, is also in the market to produce designs for individuals or organisations looking for promotional gimmicks. X-art has even produced covers for football teams so that fans can co-ordinate themselves with logos and colours even down to their mobile phones. </p> <p>Some PC manufacturers will be glad to hear that beige, too, is an option.</p>",

      "bodyText": "What is it about beige? Why is the go-getting computer industry so married to this most cheerless of liveries? Granted, the Apple designers are offering us a collection of candy coloured iMacs, and the G3 looks splendidly reminiscent of a Bondi-blue jellyfish. Meanwhile, Nokia and others offer a chance to stand out ever so slightly from the herd with customisable press on covers for handsets. But what are we to do if plastic covers, or Macs or their operating system are not to your taste? The answer is: call in the decorators. An increasing number of artists and companies are now offering to customise stuff that has being crying out for ornament and a touch of individuality. One such company, Art-tek.co.uk, offers a service to transform just about anything, from computer mice to laptops, into a gleaming, lacquered objet d'art using the honed skills of Japanese lacquerware artists. \"We think hardware should be a visual feast, coolly tactile and reflect the owners personality just like desktop designs do,\" says lacquer artist Susumu Okawa. \"So at Art-tek we enjoy turning the mundane into a highly personal work of art. Something emblematic.\" Art-tek's work is the logical extension of the success of the configure-it-yourself PC offers of Gateway and Dell and reflects the fact that many more PCs are becoming part of the furniture as PCs move into the home and should look just as good. The company takes com missions to decorate handsets and hardware in any way its clients desire, charging from \u00a390 for a simple lacquered mouse to hundreds more for a whole PC. It is no accident that Art-tek uses Japanese lacquer techniques. Much of the decorated technology available takes its cue from Japan. A combined love of decorative arts and technology is very much alive there and several companies exist to bring boring computer boxes to life. Akira Sudo's Custom Paint Computers in Tokyo specialises in decorating Macs and PDAs. (See www.jd-net.com/WM) The hand held devices it treats are particularly attractive - echoing the Japanese tradition of the lacquered box. \"We use a special paint used by Japanese auto-repair shop which makes it particularly tough and gives our work that shell-like metallic finish,\" says Sudo. For tarting up a Palm, for example, the company charges \u00a395. A small price to pay, perhaps, for the ultimate in self expression. Rather more expensive, but perhaps more convertible if you happen to be a fashion victim, are the one-off mobile handset covers being auctioned by Nokia, who commissioned top international fashion designers to create phone covers in support of the Aids charity London Lighthouse. These unique Xpress covers will be auctioned through online auction house QXL.com from 13-27 October (register for this at www.london-lighthouse.org.uk). The company that makes the Xpress covers for Nokia, X-art, is also in the market to produce designs for individuals or organisations looking for promotional gimmicks. X-art has even produced covers for football teams so that fans can co-ordinate themselves with logos and colours even down to their mobile phones. Some PC manufacturers will be glad to hear that beige, too, is an option.",

      "body": "<p><strong>Please you tell me more about the fourth Test between West Indies and India at Kingston in April 1976? It looks like a bloodbath! Five Indian batsmen were absent hurt in the second innings. What happened?</strong> asks Dean Ilott from Mexico City</p> <p>The match was played on a recently relaid pitch, which offered unpredictable bounce to the West Indian fast bowlers. Michael Holding and Wayne Daniel were in the super-fast category, while Bernard Julien and Van Holder weren't far behind. India went into the match in good form - they had made 406 runs (for only four wickets) in the final innings to win the previous Test, at Port-of-Spain - still an all-time Test record. But at Kingston two people retired hurt in their first innings of 306. Aunshuman Gaekwad was hit on the left ear and spent two nights in hospital, while Brijesh Patel had to have stitches after being hit in the mouth (remember that these were pre-helmet days). Neither of them played any further part in the match - and neither did Gundappa Viswanath, who was caught off a ball which broke a finger of his right hand. Bishan Bedi, India's captain, declared before he and Bhagwat Chandrasekhar - two of Test cricket's worst batsmen - had to face the music. India's gentle pace attack couldn't take advantage of the pitch, and West Indies made 391. Then India went in again, without the three injured batsmen. They reached 97 for 5 - 12 ahead - but that was it. Bedi said both he and Chandrasekhar had suffered hand injuries while fielding, and were also unable to bat. All 17 members of India's touring party fielded at some stage during the match - and one of the substitutes, Surinder Amarnath, was carted off to hospital during the game for an appendix operation. West Indies won the match by ten wickets, and won the series 2-1. It was the start of their surge to the top of world cricket. Their previous series had ended in a 5-1 humiliation in Australia, but after this West Indies ruled the roost until the end of the 1980s.</p> <p><strong>What are the ten ways you can be out in cricket?</strong> asks Tim Varley</p> <p>Six of them happen regularly (far too regularly if you're me) bowled, caught, hit wicket, leg before wicket (lbw), run out and stumped. Three more are rare enough to get a little section all of their own in the Wisden Almanack - handled the ball, hit the ball twice and obstructing the field. And the tenth method hardly ever happens - Timed Out. That's when the incoming batsman wilfully takes more than two minutes to come to the crease. The only man to have been given out this way in first-class cricket Is Hemulal Yadav of Tripura, during a Ranji Trophy match against Orissa at Cuttack in India in 1997-98. Wisden 1999 says: \"A drinks interval had been called at the fall of Tripura's ninth wicket, during which Yadav sat near the boundary, but the umpires said he made no attempt to come to the crease after the break, and upheld Orissa's appeal.\"</p> <p><strong>Who was the first Pakistan batsman to reach 5000 runs in Test cricket?</strong> asks Paul Bennett</p> <p>It was Zaheer Abbas, the stylish right-hander with the extravagant backlift. He passed 5000 during the first Test against New Zealand at Lahore in November 1984, and finished his Test career shortly afterwards with 5062 runs. Two others have passed 5000 since: Javed Miandad (8832 runs) and Salim Malik (5768). The next one to get there will probably be Inzamam-ul-Haq, who currently has 4504 runs in Tests.</p> <p><strong>I was surprised to discover, from the Australian Wisden, that the highest Test batting average for an Australian is not held by Don Bradman but one AE Trott, who played three Tests in the 1890s and had a batting average of 102. He is also listed as having the best bowling debut, with 8 for 43 against England. He later played for England, and died young in 1914. Can you tell me more about him?</strong> asks Matthew Brown</p> <p>Albert Trott, an attacking right-hand batsman and a medium-pace bowler, did indeed have a remarkable career. Born in Melbourne in 1873, he was called up for the third Test against England at Adelaide in 1894-95, and took 8 for 43, which remains the best bowling analysis on debut by any Test player. His scores of 38*, 72*, 85*, 10 and 0 gave him an average of 102.50. For reasons which remain unclear he was left out of the Australian team which toured England in 1896. It may have been that the captain didn't want to be accused of favouritism - it was Trott's older brother Harry. Albert Trott came to England anyway, and started playing for Middlesex in 1898. He played two Tests for England in South Africa in 1898-99, without much success, but played on at county level until 1910. In 1899, while playing for MCC against the Australians, he became the first - and still the only - batsman to hit a six over the pavilion at Lord's. After his career finished he suffered health problems, and in 1914, still only 41, he shot himself dead.</p> <p><strong>Please could you tell me the result of the last first-class match in Sheffield, which I think was in 1973?</strong> asks Peter Kerry</p> <p>I think you mean the last match at the Bramall Lane ground in Sheffield (Yorkshire played matches at Abbeydale Park, Sheffield, for a few years after 1973). The last match at Bramall Lane, before it was given over entirely to Sheffield United and football, was in August 1973. Appropriately, it was the Roses match, but inappropriately the match was ruined by rain and left drawn. Yorkshire were bowled out for 99 (seamer Peter Lee 6 for 43), Lancashire made 111 (John Sullivan 48*), then Yorkshire reached 114 for 2 (Phil Sharpe 62*). Geoff Boycott made only 9 and 6.</p> <p><strong>I'm an Englishman exiled in New York, and I work with a couple of Aussies. We miss cricket more than you can imagine, and have resolved to make a pilgrimage to Lord's next summer for the Test against Australia. What are the dates?</strong> asks Neal Davies</p> <p>Next year's Lord's Test against Australia will start on Thursday, July 19 (there's also one against Pakistan starting on May 17). Ticket details will eventually appear on the <a href=\"http://www-uk.cricket.org/link_to_database/NATIONAL/ENG/CLUBS/MCC/\">Lord's website</a>, but they're not there just yet.</p> <p><em>Steven Lynch is managing editor of Wisden Cricket Monthly.

Wisden 1999 says: \"A drinks interval had been called at the fall of Tripura's ninth wicket, during which Yadav sat near the boundary, but the umpires said he made no attempt to come to the crease after the break, and upheld Orissa's appeal.\" Who was the first Pakistan batsman to reach 5000 runs in Test cricket? asks Paul Bennett It was Zaheer Abbas, the stylish right-hander with the extravagant backlift. He passed 5000 during the first Test against New Zealand at Lahore in November 1984, and finished his Test career shortly afterwards with 5062 runs. Two others have passed 5000 since: Javed Miandad (8832 runs) and Salim Malik (5768). The next one to get there will probably be Inzamam-ul-Haq, who currently has 4504 runs in Tests. I was surprised to discover, from the Australian Wisden, that the highest Test batting average for an Australian is not held by Don Bradman but one AE Trott, who played three Tests in the 1890s and had a batting average of 102. He is also listed as having the best bowling debut, with 8 for 43 against England. He later played for England, and died young in 1914. Can you tell me more about him? asks Matthew Brown Albert Trott, an attacking right-hand batsman and a medium-pace bowler, did indeed have a remarkable career. Born in Melbourne in 1873, he was called up for the third Test against England at Adelaide in 1894-95, and took 8 for 43, which remains the best bowling analysis on debut by any Test player. His scores of 38*, 72*, 85*, 10 and 0 gave him an average of 102.50. For reasons which remain unclear he was left out of the Australian team which toured England in 1896. It may have been that the captain didn't want to be accused of favouritism - it was Trott's older brother Harry. Albert Trott came to England anyway, and started playing for Middlesex in 1898. He played two Tests for England in South Africa in 1898-99, without much success, but played on at county level until 1910. In 1899, while playing for MCC against the Australians, he became the first - and still the only - batsman to hit a six over the pavilion at Lord's. After his career finished he suffered health problems, and in 1914, still only 41, he shot himself dead. Please could you tell me the result of the last first-class match in Sheffield, which I think was in 1973? asks Peter Kerry I think you mean the last match at the Bramall Lane ground in Sheffield (Yorkshire played matches at Abbeydale Park, Sheffield, for a few years after 1973). The last match at Bramall Lane, before it was given over entirely to Sheffield United and football, was in August 1973. Appropriately, it was the Roses match, but inappropriately the match was ruined by rain and left drawn. Yorkshire were bowled out for 99 (seamer Peter Lee 6 for 43), Lancashire made 111 (John Sullivan 48*), then Yorkshire reached 114 for 2 (Phil Sharpe 62*). Geoff Boycott made only 9 and 6. I'm an Englishman exiled in New York, and I work with a couple of Aussies. We miss cricket more than you can imagine, and have resolved to make a pilgrimage to Lord's next summer for the Test against Australia. What are the dates? asks Neal Davies Next year's Lord's Test against Australia will start on Thursday, July 19 (there's also one against Pakistan starting on May 17). Ticket details will eventually appear on the Lord's website, but they're not there just yet. Steven Lynch is managing editor of Wisden Cricket Monthly.

The orders were issued simultaneously by Mr Barak and Mr Arafat during six hours of discussions in Paris arranged by Mrs Albright.</p> <p>The three areas are the Netzarim junction in northern Gaza, Joseph's Tomb in Nablus on the West Bank and the Circle area of Ramallah, also on the West Bank. An Israeli military official said the army was taking steps to avoid confrontations.</p> <p>\"The guiding principle is to see but not be seen,\" said Colonel Yossi Adiri, commander of Israeli forces near the Palestinian-ruled West Bank city of Nablus, after meeting his Palestinian counterpart. \"We understand that a visible force causes agitation, which we do not want. At the same time, these forces will be prepared for any development in the field.\"</p> <p>There have been no major clashes today, but street battles have usually erupted later in the day and three previous ceasefires have collapsed.</p> <p>Efforts to capitalise on this quiet period continued in Cairo, where Mrs Albright held talks with the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, and Mr Arafat.

      "bodyText": "The United States has helped set up a security committee to try to stave off further violence in the West Bank and Gaza after a week of clashes in which 67 people, mostly Palestinians, have died. The announcement came as Israeli and Palestinian security officials agreed a fourth ceasefire this morning, after talks between Israel's prime minister Ehud Barak and the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in Paris yesterday. \"President Clinton has already announced that the parties have agreed that the United States will chair a trilateral security committee to facilitate the process of security cooperation,\" US secretary of state Madeleine Albright said at a press conference in Cairo. In a sign of positive results from the Paris talks, the Israeli army today withdrew tanks from flashpoints in the West Bank in a respite from the worst violence between Israelis and Palestinians in years. Although Mr Arafat and Mr Barak failed to clinch a formal agreement, a ceasefire on the ground appeared to be holding in the quietest day since fighting erupted a week ago. The two men agreed to order their military commanders to separate their forces in three key flashpoint areas, according to US officials. The orders were issued simultaneously by Mr Barak and Mr Arafat during six hours of discussions in Paris arranged by Mrs Albright. The three areas are the Netzarim junction in northern Gaza, Joseph's Tomb in Nablus on the West Bank and the Circle area of Ramallah, also on the West Bank. An Israeli military official said the army was taking steps to avoid confrontations. \"The guiding principle is to see but not be seen,\" said Colonel Yossi Adiri, commander of Israeli forces near the Palestinian-ruled West Bank city of Nablus, after meeting his Palestinian counterpart. \"We understand that a visible force causes agitation, which we do not want. At the same time, these forces will be prepared for any development in the field.\" There have been no major clashes today, but street battles have usually erupted later in the day and three previous ceasefires have collapsed. Efforts to capitalise on this quiet period continued in Cairo, where Mrs Albright held talks with the Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, and Mr Arafat. Mr Barak was supposed to have taken part but returned to Israel instead, saying there was no point in continuing the discussions. Mrs Albright said that \"remarkable progress\" had been made in Paris and that both sides would follow through on security arrangements agreed there. The most contentious issue during the Paris talks was that of an inquiry into the causes of the fighting. Mr Arafat wanted an international inquiry with UN involvement, while Mr Barak preferred a joint Palestinian-Israeli investigation. At one point Mr Arafat stormed out - only to be stopped when Mrs Albright called guards to shut the residence's gates to block him. But the talks were described as productive, with US officials crediting both leaders with a sincere effort to restore the trust essential for peacemaking to proceed. US officials briefing reporters on Mrs Albright's plane said, for instance, that Mr Barak had agreed that Israeli forces would fire live ammunition only when their lives were threatened. The fighting was triggered by last Thursday's visit by rightwing Israeli politician Ariel Sharon to Jerusalem's Al Aqsa mosque compound - a site claimed as holy by both Jews and Muslims.",

The campaign fell through on technical grounds, because the European Commission introduced the measures under EU single market legislation and not as a health and safety issue. Now that the judges have thrown out the ruling, the Commission is expected to reintroduce the plans as health and safety legislation before the end of the year. Tobacco companies have insisted for years that Brussels had no legal basis to legislate across the EU on advertising. But, the Commission chose to use the single market legislation because it requires only a qualified majority of member states to go through and is therefore quicker.",

The west is also placing its hope in the man poised to take over from Slobodan Milosevic if the current campaign of civil disobedience succeeds. But the 56-year-old Mr Kostunica is no liberal. He is a fervent Serb nationalist who rails against Nato, as much as the present regime, for Belgrade's distressed state. He has said he would refuse to turn Mr Milosevic over to the Hague war crimes tribunal, does not recognise Montenegro's existence as a republic and would demand that Nato forces leave Kosovo and Serb forces be allowed to return. The soft-spoken and dour lawyer was even photographed last year in northern Kosovo brandishing an assault rifle, paramilitary-style. But given Serbia's desperate wish to end its pariah status, the west can count on Mr Kostunica not to indulge in the kind of military adventurism that has spilt so much blood and led to a truncated Yugoslavia, shorn of Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, and effectively Kosovo. At the very least, Mr Kostunica can be expected to back off from moves to destabilise Montenegro in return for desperately-needed western aid. He has said he would accept a pro-independence referendum in Montenegro, but expects the majority of Montegrins to stay within what remains of Yugoslavia. And he has gone on record as saying that Serbia should make its peace with Europe. Mr Kostunica's primary appeal to his long-suffering compatriots is his reputation for honesty - in contrast to other opposition leaders, tainted by allegations of corruption and their willingness to compromise with the regime. Unlike Vuk Draksovic and Zoran Djindjic, two other opposition figures, who favoured large Audis and long holidays on Montenegro's coastline, Mr Kostunica drives a battered Yugo.

Even Mr Kostunica's lack of charisma works in his favour as Serbians see his penchant for academic jargon rather than glib sound bites as evidence of his integrity.

Hussain registered the century partnership with a straight six off Naimur Rahman's off-spin and got his first 50 in nine one-day international innings in the next over, sweeping Hoque for four. Stewart drove Rahman straight for another boundary, to bring up England's 150 in the 30th over.</p> <p>It was a signal for a rare Hussain purple patch.

British children will answer to Begbie, Spud, Sick Boy (Trainspotting), Spike (Notting Hill), Lomper and Horse (The Full Monty), Soap, Bacon, Dog and Plank (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels) and their regional variants. </p> <p>As in ancient times, many British men are named for ease of identification with their trade, such as Tinker, an Irish labourer (The Crying Game), William Thacker, a bookshop owner in Notting Hill, or Mr Bean, a man whose escapades evoke the British love of toilet humour, engendered by the laxative effect of baked beans. (See sense of humour, below.) </p> <p>At the lower end of the social scale, nostalgia for the second world war still resonates, with chocks-away names such as Bunty (Chicken Run) and Daffy (The Beach) enjoying a resurgence, while at the higher end of the scale, anyone who isn't the Duke of Norfolk or the Earl of Sussex is called Charles or Rufus, or if they live in Scotland, Angus or \"Mac\". There aren't many women in Britain, but the few there are derive their names from US movie history (Scarlett, Four Weddings) or are called Victoria and Elizabeth and are the Queen of England. </p> <p><strong> The economy</strong><br> </p> <p> The engine of the British economy is driven by cannabis farming (Saving Grace; Lock, Stock), a booming cottage industry that fluctuates in accordance with the laws of plunder and gang in-fighting. Northern cities such as Sheffield used to be great centres of industry, but had to close when the demand for cutlery on the southern wedding circuit used up all their materials. There is a bitter divide between the prosperous south, where owners of money-losing bookshops maintain houses in London's most expensive districts, and the north, where levels of deprivation are such that repressed former steel workers have to strip to earn a crust and striking miners burn pianos for firewood. Ireland is mostly under water (Angela's Ashes). </p> <p><strong> Class system</strong><br> </p> <p> Britain operates on a more or less feudal system. Slave labour (allegorically addressed in Chicken Run) is a reality for the serfs who live north of the Wash and subsist on a diet of boiled eggs and amphetamines. Cultural deprivation has turned them wild: they underline their points by upsetting teacups and sob after their annual glass of wine at Christmas. Exposure to the Royal Ballet renders them infantile. </p> <p>Leisure activities in Britain are deeply divided by class. Children in the north of England start drinking cider at the age of 11, and their fathers box or pursue the popular working-class pastime of loitering (Billy Elliot; The Full Monty; Brassed Off). They are cold, but they've got rhythm. Middle-class men in the north of England collect garden gnomes, and those from the south attend the screening of foreign language films and learn sign language to better communicate with the deaf (Four Weddings). </p> <p>In Scotland, the Darwinian principle of survival of the fittest is a daily reality, where drug addicts compete with Scottish nationalists on the streets of Glasgow and the highlands are populated by red-haired giants known as \"clansmen\", harbouring ancient hatreds and nursing glory in their hearts (Rob Roy). </p> <p><strong> Job opportunities</strong> </p> <p> Nobody in Britain works, except for a few caterers on the London party circuit and some Irish terrorists posing as builders. Instead, men of working age picket their employers for reasons unknown - possibly for a better dress allowance - and attend job clubs, converted classrooms in which they are tempted out of the iron age by being taught how to operate a word processor (The Full Monty). However, their permanent state of outrage renders most northern men unemployable. When their wives (or more probably, ex-wives) are prised out of the kitchen, it is only to work in an environment where they are permitted to smoke, such as a municipal hall, the fields, or behind the bar in a working men's club. </p> <p>The social commitments of the metropolitan elite make full-time work out of the question, although they play at the fringes of the more genteel trades, such as antiquarian book selling, the voluntary sector and the business of opening a restaurant. </p> <p><strong> Transport</strong> </p> <p> The National Express coach net work is the only way of travelling up and down the country, although it's a journey that few undertake, given the shock awaiting them on arrival. Men entering London from the north for the first time are disoriented by its lack of coalmines and the suspicion that all southern men are repressed homosexuals. Southern men taking the coach north close their eyes until they reach Scotland, when they are whisked away from the terminus to their highland estates (Four Weddings; Elizabeth; Mrs Brown). </p> <p>Londoners get around in four-wheel drive vehicles or hail a taxi, or if they are on urgent business, steal a van. There are buses in London, but they are decorative rather than functional and cater largely for the tourist market. In Scotland people make do with walking or, more commonly, running, with the law in pursuit. </p> <p><strong> Communication</strong> </p> <p> A Briton from the south who trips over a paving stone might exclaim \"oops-a-daisy\" (Notting Hill), whereas a northerner might say \"fook\". (Billy Elliot). A northerner defending himself against a verbal attack might plead \"keep your blob on\", which is patois for \"remain calm\". Other key words in the northerner's vocabulary are, \"twat\", \"wanker\", and \"chuffed\", and most northerners communicate by using combinations of these three basic terms. </p> <p>The Scottish speak a pidgin language that requires subtitles in more evolved parts of the English-speaking world. For example, \"fling yir fuckin jaykit oan well\" means \"hang your coat up\", and \"ye ken she's really intae ye\" stands for \"you know she finds you attractive\". \"Ya plukey-faced wee hing oot\" has no known English equivalent. </p> <p>In London, men affectionately greet each other as \"bruvver\", as in \"nice one, bruvver\", or \"geezer\", as in \"all right, geezer?\", or confine themselves to the universal greeting of the east end, \"safe\", which means, \"hello\" (Lock, Stock). </p> <p><strong> Dress</strong> </p> <p> The British are unjustly targeted as poor dressers, when in fact they adhere to a strict set of tribal dress codes. Donkey jackets are the uniform of the northern man, where the recession has hit the manufacture of any colour brighter than grey, and northern women wear gold hoops through their ears and tracksuit bottoms that have lost their elastic. In the south, it is customary for men to wear suits, with an optional cummerbund around the waist, and for women to wear wide hats and ethnic jewellery, or to dye their hair burnt orange in protest against the burden of privilege under which they live (Four Weddings). </p> <p><strong> Sex</strong> </p> <p> Sex in Britain, if it exists at all, is a quick and unfulfilling affair. British men prefer the company of other British men and are predominantly asexual (Mr Bean), unless they are pursuing the age-old highland sport of rape and pillage. Since most British women are either recently deceased, of retirement age, or members of the royal family, sex is off the agenda. They tend to regard men as feeble under-performers who don't live up to their fathers (A Fish Called Wanda) or as brutes liable to pawn their jewellery as soon as they hit the pathologist's slab (Billy Elliot). A British man called upon to court a woman will go through a series of extraordinary contortions, culminating in a slapstick attempt to embrace her and ending in total humiliation, probably in his socks and underpants (Notting Hill). When it comes to sex, most British men would rather sit on a park bench reading Captain Corelli's Mandolin or marry their labradors. </p> <p><strong> Sense of humour</strong> </p> <p> Since the British laugh at their own shortcomings, they are in a perpetual state of amusement. They are particularly aroused by stories turning on the triumph of the underdog, such as a boy from a northern housing estate getting into the Royal Ballet school, hens escaping from a slaughterhouse, or a humble bookseller from Notting Hill wooing a Hollywood movie star with hilarious consequences. </p> <p>When the underdog spills things, walks into doors and is caught picking his nose by the object of his affection, the average Briton will be diverted for hours. Anyone who speaks in an accent three or more counties removed from his listener is guaranteed a delirious audience. </p> <p><strong>Big over there</strong></p> <p>1 Notting Hill (1999) $116.1m </p> <p>2 Chicken Run (2000) $106m </p> <p>3 The Crying Game (1992) $62.5m </p> <p>4 Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994) $52.7m </p> <p>5 The Full Monty (1997) $45.9m </p> <p>6 Bean (1997) $45.3m </p> <p>7 The Beach (2000) $39.8m </p> <p>8 The Lawnmower Man (1992) $32.1m </p> <p>9 Rob Roy (1995) $31.6m </p> <p>10 Elizabeth (1998) $30m</p>",

Alas, their luggage did not follow them to Berlin. Lufthansa promised it would arrive on the next flight to Berlin. It didn't. Then it was to be delivered overnight. It wasn't. Lufthansa said it had been put on the wrong aircraft and would be there the following afternoon. It wasn't. That evening they were told there was no trace of the luggage on the computer; the next morning they learnt that one suitcase had shown up, but it was up to them to collect it; the other, containing vital medication for his daughter's back problems, had not. \"By then my daughter had used up all her tablets in her hand luggage and was in such distress that she took an early flight home,\" says Hutchinson.

In the morning of her departure she was rung by airline officials wanting to confirm her seat, and she arrived at check-in three hours early as advised.

The Daily Express also believes that Blackburn Rovers are to make another attempt to sign Liverpool's Brad Friedel. The US international has been denied a work permit at Anfield, but Rovers are confident of adding Friedel to their roster. Rio Ferdinand has asked West Ham fans not to believe rumours linking him with a move to Leeds United. \"I know where I am and I am happy at West Ham,\" Ferdinand is quoted as saying in the Daily Star. \"What frustrates me is that fans will start thinking I'm putting it in the papers, or that perhaps my agent is. That is simply not the case.\"",

The 1998 directive had called for the phasing out of all tobacco advertising and sponsorship by 2006, but the EU's highest court ruled that the commission had \"no power\" to introduce the ban under single market legislation. The court's ruling followed a demand by the German government to cancel the directive, and a complaint by Imperial Tobacco Group plc and other tobacco producers, referred by the UK courts. The court said the directive should not have been adopted as an EU internal market directive aimed at removing market distortions. Germany and the producers argued it was a public health measure. The commission chose to use its single market provisions partly because EU laws on the single market only require a qualified majority of member states to approve them. Germany and Austria had opposed the original directive banning tobacco advertising. The commission is expected to attempt another ban under health and safety issues before the end of the year. John Carlyle, executive director of public affairs of the Tobacco Manufacturers Association, said: \"We welcome this judgment as we have always believed that the European Commission and the British government were acting illegally. \"We now hope that the government will talk with the industry and we look forward to talking to them. \"We still believe that we have the right to communicate with our adult customers to sell a legally available product and we will fight to retain that right.\" The court found that a publicity ban did not do away with distortions of competition between EU member states, which could be because of different production costs. \"The court estimates that a general ban on advertising for a large range of forms (posters, umbrellas, ash trays, hotel objects, film trailers) does not contribute to easing trade in the products,\" it also said. However, the court noted that some measures partially banning certain forms of publicity and sponsorship could be acceptable as an internal market measure. Different national rules, such as a ban on sponsorship in certain member states, can distort competition by determining where a sports competition may take place and affect the firms involved, it said. The publishing industry, as well as tobacco companies, had been arguing for years that Brussels had no legal basis for attempting to legislate across the EU on advertising.",

Bill Wilson, chief executive at Teamtalk, said: \"Not only will this enhance Teamtalk's reputation, but it will also widen our fan base and increase our global footprint.\" Teamtalk, which was set up in 1988, covers football, rugby league and union, golf, cricket, tennis, horse and greyhound racing, and has one of the largest user bases among UK sports websites. Teamtalk floated on AIM in April this year raising funds of \u00a345m, however, its share price has flat-lined around the 80p mark since the market slowdown earlier this year.",

Survivors of the two-train smash gathered at Paddington station in west London for the silence, which took place at 8.11am. That was the moment on 5 October last year when a Thames Trains' turbo crashed almost head-on with a London-bound Great Western train at Ladbroke Grove in west London. As well as the loss of 31 lives, more than 400 people were injured in the crash, the worst in terms of fatalities since the December 1988 Clapham rail disaster. While a silence was being observed at Paddington, the Bishop of Kensington, the Rt Rev Michael Colclough, was offering support and prayers for those attending a private ceremony close to the crash site. Great Western cancelled today's 6.03am Cheltenham-London service, the same time as the one that was in the crash, as a mark of respect. Flowers were being laid at Reading station, in Berkshire, and at other stations on the Cheltenham to London route. A further minute's silence was being observed, with prayers being said at the crash site at noon. Mr Colclough is preaching at a 4pm memorial service at Westminster Central Hall, the venue for the public inquiry into the crash. The bishop was asking the injured and bereaved to remember those who died \"with love and thankfulness ... not to bring back the past, but to set themselves to the future.\" The victims of the crash, who are critical of the pace of safety improvements, were led by the badly-injured Pam Warren, 33, founder of the Paddington Survivors Group. The group is particularly incensed that the Government, backed by an official report, is choosing a less-sophisticated and vastly cheaper form of train protection, the Train Protection Warning System, for nationwide introduction. \"One year on, my main thought is how horrible it is that nothing much has changed in rail safety,\" said Mrs Warren, from Reading, who has had to wear a plastic face mask for months because of her severe burns. Survivors say the costly Automatic Train Protection system, due to be introduced gradually, should be installed at once, as was recommended after the 1988 Clapham rail disaster. A public inquiry into train protection systems is continuing in London.

      "body": "<p>Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation is interested in buying Russia's biggest and most influential independent media group, according to reports in Moscow, though any deal would be controversial. </p> <p>The Media-most company of exiled mogul Vladimir Gusinsky is at the centre of a bitter battle for control of its assets with the Kremlin and Mr Gusinsky's main creditor, Gazprom, Russia's gas monopoly. It includes Russia's biggest private television channel, NTV, cable TV operations, a Moscow radio station, and a daily newspaper. </p> <p>Rem Vyakhirev, the powerful head of Gazprom, Russia's biggest company which is part-owned by the state, said he was insisting on taking over Media-most and selling it on unless Mr Gusinsky came up with the $211m (\u00a3144m) it owes and a further $272m due for repayment next year. </p> <p>\"We are demanding the return of the debt. This is not politics,\" said Mr Vyakhirev in Delhi, where he is accompanying President Putin on an official visit. \"If they can't pay the money, we'll take the Media-most shares and sell them to someone who will pay more.\" </p> <p>An western media holding company was showing an interest, he added. Gazprom sources told the Kommersant newspaper the prospective buyer was News Corp, which had shown its interest \"orally and in written form\". </p> <p>Martin Pompadur, an executive vice-president of News Corporation in charge of European operations, was understood to be on business in Russia this week, but News Corp declined to comment on what it called speculation. </p> <p>There is no sizeable foreign ownership of the media in Russia as the sector is heavily indebted and barely profitable.

      "bodyText": "Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation is interested in buying Russia's biggest and most influential independent media group, according to reports in Moscow, though any deal would be controversial. The Media-most company of exiled mogul Vladimir Gusinsky is at the centre of a bitter battle for control of its assets with the Kremlin and Mr Gusinsky's main creditor, Gazprom, Russia's gas monopoly. It includes Russia's biggest private television channel, NTV, cable TV operations, a Moscow radio station, and a daily newspaper. Rem Vyakhirev, the powerful head of Gazprom, Russia's biggest company which is part-owned by the state, said he was insisting on taking over Media-most and selling it on unless Mr Gusinsky came up with the $211m (\u00a3144m) it owes and a further $272m due for repayment next year. \"We are demanding the return of the debt. This is not politics,\" said Mr Vyakhirev in Delhi, where he is accompanying President Putin on an official visit. \"If they can't pay the money, we'll take the Media-most shares and sell them to someone who will pay more.\" An western media holding company was showing an interest, he added. Gazprom sources told the Kommersant newspaper the prospective buyer was News Corp, which had shown its interest \"orally and in written form\". Martin Pompadur, an executive vice-president of News Corporation in charge of European operations, was understood to be on business in Russia this week, but News Corp declined to comment on what it called speculation. There is no sizeable foreign ownership of the media in Russia as the sector is heavily indebted and barely profitable. A foreign takeover of such a substantial group could cause political problems for Mr Putin, with communists and nationalists complaining of the country's second biggest TV channel becoming anti-Russian. Mr Gusinsky fled Russia for Spain in July after his offices were raided by heavily armed paramilitary police and he was briefly jailed. Criminal charges against him were suddenly dropped in return for his selling out to Gazprom. This agreement he now says was signed, under duress and at gunpoint. Dmitry Ostalsky, a spokesman in Moscow for Mr Gusinsky, said he knew nothing of the proposed Murdoch bid. \"We've got nothing against western investors, but, of course, this is not normal because Gazprom does not own Media-most.\" Mr Vyakhirev said that under the deal signed on July 20, the gas company agreed to take on all of Media-most's debt and pay Mr Gusinsky a further $300m.

Two of America's four major television networks - NBC and Fox - decided not to offer live coverage of Tuesday night's face-off between Al Gore and George W Bush. Instead of watching the first debate in what is shaping up to be the closest US presidential race since 1960, viewers were offered the chance to watch a baseball game or the premiere of Dark Angel, a new sci-fi adventure featuring a genetically enhanced prototype woman.</p> <p>This decision - taken sheepishly by the National Broadcasting Corporation and with some gusto by the Rupert Murdoch-owned Fox channel - has reopened the debate about what constitutes public service broadcasting in the US. The row offers a transatlantic perspective on the industry battle between commercial organizations and government guardians as the UK debate rages on over whether the evening news should be seen at 9pm or later.</p> <p>In some ways, it is difficult for outsiders to see what all the fuss is about. Most Americans can chose between 50 and 75 television channels. Even New Yorkers offered NBC's match between the local Yankees and Oakland Athletics could watch the political debate live on no fewer than eight channels.</p> <p>The answer came in a blistering piece written by William Kennard, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, the US television watchdog, on the day of the planned debate. Under the headline 'Fox and NBC Renege on a Debt', Mr Kennard pointed out that the US congress had agreed to give public broadcasters extra spectrum to provide the next wave of digital television services four years ago as long as they continued to 'serve the public interest'. He estimated the commercial value of this extra air space at more than $70bn and added there was \"no underestimating\" the value of televised political debates.</p> <p>Put simply, while America's numerous cable channels are allowed to offer as much entertainment as they want, public broadcasters are not because they receive licenses from the government to use the public airwaves.</p> <p>\"As trustees of the public airwaves, the networks must do more than just entertain: they must also serve the needs of citizens by facilitating an informed democratic process\" wrote Mr Kennard. He ended his article in the New York Times with a warning that \"in the future, the networks should remember that the public interest is far more important than their financial interest.\"</p> <p>Fox, which does not intend to show any of the three planned presidential debates nor the vice-presidential one tonight, made a new offer as Mr Kennard's article was going to print. The station offered each of the contenders a blank half-hour slot on prime-time Friday night television at the end of October to answer the question: 'Why should Americans vote for you?'</p> <p>Given that one of the participants himself - George W Bush - failed to change the allotted slot for air time agreed by the bipartisan debate committee, this plan is unlikely to change the official timetable.</p> <p>Neither the FCC, nor the candidates, has replied to it. Indeed, the FCC, which has the power to revoke a network's public broadcasting license, has said little about the entire issue since the publication of Mr Kennard's article.</p> <p>Television executives mutter that in the age of the internet, where there is so much choice over what to watch and when, the notion of public service is irrelevant anyway. \"There's only a finite number of people who want to watch the debates,\" said one, who nevertheless refused to be named.</p> <p>In the end, an estimated 75m people watched the first live debate of this year's election. With both NBC and Fox sticking to their plans not to offer live coverage, however, the debates could end with fewer viewers than a ball game and a Lara Croft-lookalike. If so, it will be a close-run thing to see which contestant turns grey and clammy first in the battle ahead between the government and the television industry.</p>",

Given that one of the participants himself - George W Bush - failed to change the allotted slot for air time agreed by the bipartisan debate committee, this plan is unlikely to change the official timetable. Neither the FCC, nor the candidates, has replied to it. Indeed, the FCC, which has the power to revoke a network's public broadcasting license, has said little about the entire issue since the publication of Mr Kennard's article. Television executives mutter that in the age of the internet, where there is so much choice over what to watch and when, the notion of public service is irrelevant anyway. \"There's only a finite number of people who want to watch the debates,\" said one, who nevertheless refused to be named. In the end, an estimated 75m people watched the first live debate of this year's election. With both NBC and Fox sticking to their plans not to offer live coverage, however, the debates could end with fewer viewers than a ball game and a Lara Croft-lookalike. If so, it will be a close-run thing to see which contestant turns grey and clammy first in the battle ahead between the government and the television industry.",

Graphic images of children being tortured and apparently murdered were followed within minutes by an apology which in turn led to resignations and allegations of rampant corruption.

Shaking with anger, he attempted to scalp a political opponent in the process. Mr Lerner claimed the chairman of the parliamentary commission on the media, Mario Landolfi, had pressured him during lunch. \"When coffee came, he took out a scrap of paper and told me: 'There's this person to fix up, if possible.'\" Confirming widespread suspicions that RAI's three state-owned channels were riddled with patronage, the scandal has catapulted media ownership back on to the agenda in the run-up to the general election.

      "body": "<p>Imperial nationalism is bad because it is imperial, not because it is nationalist. It is worth recalling that most empires have been constructed on behalf of dynasties, religions, or secular ideologies such as Marxism-Leninism. Cultural nationalism, as a rule, is too inward-looking to serve as the basis of an imperial ideology. Nazi Germany is often held up as an example of the evils of nationalism, but Hitler's ideology was a kind of racist transnationalism, which held that all true \"Aryans\" were kin, whether they shared a common language and culture or not. Anyway, imperial nationalisms are greatly outnumbered by anti-imperial nationalisms, for the simple reason that small ethnic nations have enough trouble holding their own without trying to conquer their regions, much less the world. The purpose of most nationalists is nothing more sinister than trying to preserve the identity of a relatively small ethnic and linguistic community by achieving and maintaining independence as a sovereign political community.</p> <p>This is why it is so absurd to blame the world wars of the 20th century on the nationalist movements in the Balkans. Nationalism in the decaying Habsburg empire was the trigger of the first world war, not the cause. The cause of the first world war was Germany's ambition to become the dominant world power by becoming the dominant European power - an ambition which threatened the interests of Russia, France, Britain, and the US - empires all.</p> <p>Instead of blaming nationalism for 20th-century wars which were really caused by imperial rivalries, we should give some credit to the stubborn and defiant particularism of anti-fascist and anti-communist nationalists in Europe and Asia for defeating the transnational tyrannies of National Socialism and communism. Nationalists from France to Poland to Greece battled heroically to stop their countries from being melted down into Hitler's New Order; and nationalists from central Asia to the Baltic republics brought down the Soviet empire when the Soviet elite no longer had the nerve to hold it together by terror. Some of those anti-Nazi and anti-Soviet nationalists were democrats; some were not. But even the partisans and the dissidents who did have democratic values did not want democracy in the abstract. They wanted democracy for their people - the Danes, the Ukrainians, the Lithuanians, the Poles. Thanks in part to their battles for \"narrow\" and \"ethnocentric\" national self-determination, the world was saved from domination by supra-national totalitarianism. Johann Gottfried von Herder wrote in 1791: \"How wonderfully has Nature separated nations, not only by woods and mountains, seas and deserts, rivers and climates, but most particularly by languages, inclinations and characters, [so] that the work of subjugating despotism might be rendered more difficult...\"</p> <p>Critics of nationalism often assume that national sentiment is somehow incompatible with democracy. In fact, the relationship tends to be the other way around. Almost all stable democracies are nation-states, while multinational states tend to be dictatorships. The reason is simple. In a mono-ethnic society, ethnic power is not an issue; whichever party wins in Sweden will be made up of Swedes. That means that there can be political coalitions based on various other aspects of identity - class, or religion, or political ideology. But in a multi-ethnic society, political parties usually coalesce around the main ethnic groups. Each ethnic group is afraid that the others will seize control of the machinery of government. In Belgium, the Flemings worry that the Walloons will be too powerful; in Canada, the Anglo-Canadians and Quebecois eye one another with distrust. At worst, as in Yugoslavia and Lebanon, the competition between ethnic parties escalates into war.</p> <p>Only Tito's dictatorship held the Yugoslav federation together. The Soviet Union broke up along national lines the moment that a degree of democracy was permitted. There are very few stable multi-ethnic democracies. The ones that do exist - such as Switzerland - tend to be based on intricate constitutional arrangements such as elaborate systems of federalism and equally elaborate systems of power-sharing. Political philosophers and Op-Ed columnists can have fun devising intricate power-sharing schemes for a multi-ethnic Bosnia or a multi-ethnic Kosovo. But realistic policymakers have to face the fact that power-sharing systems seldom work.</p> <p>Where a state like Yugoslavia has crumbled because its constituent ethnic nations do not want to live together, it is folly for outsiders to try to force them together in a shotgun marriage - or rather a shotgun remarriage. In such circumstances, it is in the interest of all concerned that the outside powers act as divorce counsellors, seeing to it that the divorce takes place with as little bloodshed as possible. The wisest course may be to turn temporary division into permanent partition, and to recognise formally the existence of new nation-states. The results will not always be fair: some individuals will not be able to return to their homes; some groups will find themselves minorities trapped behind new borders. But in diplomacy as in the rest of life, the perfect is the enemy of the good. The rough justice of partition may be acceptable if it prevents endless warfare or endless peacekeeping.</p> <p>The Balkans is not the only place where there may never be lasting peace or prosperity until borders are redrawn, at least roughly, along national lines. In sub-Saharan Africa, most of the states are artificial creations of British and French colonial administrators. The map of African governments cuts across the map of African ethnic nations. There is no Nigerian or South African nation, any more than there was a Yugoslav or Soviet nation. One reason why so many African states are dictatorships is that force is required to prevent these artificial contraptions from breaking down in civil war among the rival ethnic nations, like the Hutu and Tutsi in Rwanda and Burundi. (Incidentally, one of the unfortunate residues of western racism and imperialism is the tendency to describe the nations of western Europe as nations, the nations of eastern Europe as ethnic groups, and the nations of Africa as tribes.) Any attempt to make political borders correspond with ethnic nations in Africa, as in the Balkans, would be messy and imperfect. But the alternative - preserving the political relics of European colonialism forever at the cost of endless authoritarianism and internecine conflict and the poverty which comes in their wake - is much worse than redrawing a border here and a border there.</p> <p>Needless to say, most of the several thousand ethnic groups in the world are too small to have states of their own - although the example of the Slovenes proves that statehood is possible for very tiny nations. The Sorbs and Wends of Germany will never have their own nation-states, any more than the German-speaking Amish in the US will have theirs. But the fact that every tiny ethnic group does not qualify for statehood does not discredit the desire for independence of substantial ethnic nations like the Kurds.</p> <p>At what point would there be too many countries? Between 1945 and today, the number of UN member states increased from 51 to 188. The addition of a dozen or two dozen more nation-states would not create chaos. At any given time, there are only a few great military and economic powers, and it is on their relations among themselves, not the number of small states, that international order depends.</p> <p>Most nation-states are relatively small, but this need not be a handicap. A small nation-state can take advantage of commercial economies of scale by joining the global market or a trading bloc like the EU or Asean; and it can take advantage of military economies of scale by joining a military alliance like Nato. Because of its political sovereignty, a nation-state, even a small, weak, nation-state, can negotiate the nature of its relations with its trading partners and its military allies. This is something no ethnic minority in a multinational state can ever do.</p> <p>In this connection, it is useful to distinguish internationalism from transnationalism. Internationalism presupposes the existence of distinct nations which interact with one another on a voluntary basis. Transnationalism posits the disappearance of nation-states and their replacement by something else - sub-national tribes, supra-national blocs.</p> <p>While the supposed trend toward transnationalism is a mirage, the growth of internationalism is real. It is more a consequence of the end of the cold war and the division of the countries of the world into rival camps than of the internet or trade treaties. There is no contradiction between the multiplication of nation-states and increasing international integration. Slovenia escaped from its involuntary membership in Yugoslavia, and immediately applied for admission to Nato and the EU. It is an abuse of language to say that when a country joins a military alliance or a trading bloc it is \"surrendering its sovereignty.\" On the contrary, it is exercising its sovereignty, so long as it retains the option to quit the alliance or trading bloc if it so chooses.</p> <p>The globalisation of commerce is an example of internationalism, not transnationalism. A Norwegian may order a product from Thailand over the internet. But he is still a Norwegian; the Norwegian government can tax and conscript him, the Thai government cannot; and it is the Norwegian government, not the Thai government, which provides for his health care and his state pension out of taxes levied on his fellow Norwegians. Globalisation is reshaping nations - but it is not replacing them.</p> <p>All of this raises an interesting question. If the nation-state is alive and well, and if nationalism is by no means the evil that it is made out to be, then why is there so much loathing of nationalism and propaganda in favour of various kinds of supra-national systems of world order? One reason is obvious: most of the states in Africa, and the middle east, and much of Asia, are non-national entities whose borders are threatened by nationalist movements. The UN should really be called the United Regimes, inasmuch as many of the members of the general assembly are multinational states held together by repression. For obvious reasons, many of these governments would prefer that self-determination be sacrificed to the sanctity of inherited borders, no matter how absurd and anachronistic the borders are. But this doesn't explain the intense hostility to nationalism in the western media, and all of the addled talk about the nation-state withering away.</p> <p>Every segment of the political spectrum in the west - left, centre and right - has its own fantasy version of cosmopolis. The socialist left, for almost two centuries, has hoped, in the face of all evidence, that international class loyalties will eventually prevail over inter-class national loyalties. Libertarians hope to reduce countries to nothing more than postcodes in the free global market. The influence of Protestant millenarianism and evangelism can be seen on British liberal internationalism and American Wilsonian liberalism. There is even a kind of conservative internationalism - although it is that of reactionary traditionalists such as John Lukacs, nostalgic for a pre-national, aristocratic European Christendom, rather than of the populists and nationalists who dominate the right in most western countries. (Given that most of literate, civilised humanity lived for most of history under non-national empires - some, like China and Rome, of long duration and lasting cultural importance - it is surprising that there is not more of this kind of conservative nostalgia for imperial civilisations.)</p> <p>Whether the chattering classes like it or not, a century from now there will be more nation-states in the world, and fewer multinational states. Nation-states like Japan and Russia and China and the US and Germany and India and Brazil, in some form, will still be here. But many if not most of today's multinational states will have vanished from the map. The UK may give way to a federation of the nation-states of England, Scotland, Ireland and Wales. Australia and New Zealand will be sovereign republics. Canada is unlikely to survive the 21st century; the only question is whether the English-speaking provinces join the US or stragggle along on their own, when the federation dissolves. Indonesia and Malaysia may be replaced on the map by a number of new, smaller countries. Not all of the nationalism of the century ahead will be disintegrative. A Greater Albania and a Kurdistan might be cobbled together. The inevitable overthrow of the remaining monarchies in the middle east may produce the amalgamation of portions of the Arab world, a region where the present borders were drawn up generations ago by the colonial bureaucrats of Britain and France. Not every nation will obtain its state: China is unlikely to free Tibet; and India is unlikely to consent to a Sikh nation-state. Whether Africa progresses or continues to decay depends in large part on whether the international community permits genuine nation-states to be formed from the wreckage of the post-colonial regimes. In some cases, such as the break-up of the UK, these changes might occur without bloodshed; in other cases they may be accompanied by immense suffering, and may even trigger conflicts among rival great powers.</p> <p>A case can be made that, on the whole, the good which has come with replacing multinational dynastic empires and dictatorships with nation-states which at least have a chance to become stable liberal democracies, has outweighed the bad which often accompanies the break-up of non-national states. In any event, the future seems clear. The 19th century was a century of nationalism. The 20th century was also a century of nationalism. In all likelihood, the 21st century will be a century of nationalism as well.</p> <p>Michael Lind is senior fellow at the New America Foundation in Washington DC and writes fiction, non-fiction and poetry.</p> <p>\u00a9 Prospect 2000</p>",

It was not immediately clear if this means a complete rerun of the elections will be required. The court is to release a full ruling on Thursday.</p> <p>The constitutional court ruling - by judges loyal to the president - could be aimed at allowing Milosevic to stay in power longer; his term does not expire until the middle of next year, which leaves him free to set a new election date any time before then. Milosevic's government conceded that Kostunica gained more votes than Milosevic, but not a large enough margin to allow him to avoid a second round of voting. The opposition said it would boycott a second round.</p> <p>The unexpected court ruling appeared calculated to help Milosevic regain the upper hand after losing ground in growing popular protests against his rule.</p> <p>Police on Wednesday were forced to abandoned plans to take over a striking coal mine after confronting fearless anti-Milosevic crowds - a stunning development unprecedented in a former communist nation with no history of major worker uprisings.</p> <p>The court ruling on Wednesday infuriated opposition leaders. \"He saw that he cannot push through the second round against the majority of the people,\" opposition campaign manager Zoran Djindjic said of Milosevic, adding: \"His solution is ... to create a new situation for totally new elections; allowing him to cling to power for further months.\"</p> <p>Ironically, the court ruling was indirectly initiated by the opposition after it pressed its claims of election fraud before the judges. The tribunal met in emergency session to hear claims by the 18-party opposition coalition that Milosevic's cronies manipulated election results by using a sophisticated software program, a copy of which opposition leaders claimed to have obtained.</p> <p>Even before the court ruling, passions were high. Zoran Zivkovic, the mayor of Nis, the nation's third largest city, said any violence on the part of Milosevic's forces Thursday would be met by violence from crowds. \"I'm telling the army and police that we won't stop,\" said Zivkovic, addressing 30,000 anti-Milosevic demonstrators in Nis on Wednesday. \"We are going to Belgrade to finish off what we had started in the elections.\"</p> <p>Before the court's decision was announced, top opposition figures had been buoyed by the police capitulation at the Kolubara mine complex. They rushed to join more than 10,000 protesters there and openly predicted Milosevic's quick demise. \"Serbia has risen so that one man would leave,\" Kostunica told cheering workers and their supporters at the Kolubara mine near Lazarevac, about 25 miles south of Belgrade.</p> <p>Opposition leaders issued an ultimatum for Milosevic to resign by 3pm on Thursday - the time set for the Belgrade rally. \"This flame will engulf the whole of Belgrade,\" said Vladan Batic, an opposition leader.</p> <p>Police in riot gear had occupied the strip mine complex in an attempt to break up the largest of the nationwide strikes against Milosevic, but were unable to contain a swelling crowd that heeded the workers' cry for help. With sunset approaching, the police gave up. Most police withdrew from their barricades and mingled with strikers inside the compound.</p> <p>The mine walkout was the forerunner of other strikes; state telecommunications company workers announced they would stay away from work, and city bus drivers and garbage collectors in Belgrade also refused to work. It is the first widespread strike action in Yugoslavia's 55-year history.</p> <p>In an open letter to Milosevic, Kostunica said, \"It will be better for you to recognize electoral defeat or risk the danger of open clashes nationwide.\"</p> <p>Even before the court ruling, however, Milosevic, showed no signs he was contemplating defeat. His prime minister, Momir Bulatovic, repeated the position that Milosevic can remain in office until June 2001 regardless of the election outcome.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In what appeared to be the latest ploy to buy time for the president, Yugoslavia's highest court invalidated part of the September 24 presidential elections, which Milosevic's opponents say was won outright by his rival Vojislav Kostunica. It was not immediately clear if this means a complete rerun of the elections will be required. The court is to release a full ruling on Thursday. The constitutional court ruling - by judges loyal to the president - could be aimed at allowing Milosevic to stay in power longer; his term does not expire until the middle of next year, which leaves him free to set a new election date any time before then. Milosevic's government conceded that Kostunica gained more votes than Milosevic, but not a large enough margin to allow him to avoid a second round of voting. The opposition said it would boycott a second round. The unexpected court ruling appeared calculated to help Milosevic regain the upper hand after losing ground in growing popular protests against his rule. Police on Wednesday were forced to abandoned plans to take over a striking coal mine after confronting fearless anti-Milosevic crowds - a stunning development unprecedented in a former communist nation with no history of major worker uprisings. The court ruling on Wednesday infuriated opposition leaders. \"He saw that he cannot push through the second round against the majority of the people,\" opposition campaign manager Zoran Djindjic said of Milosevic, adding: \"His solution is ... to create a new situation for totally new elections; allowing him to cling to power for further months.\" Ironically, the court ruling was indirectly initiated by the opposition after it pressed its claims of election fraud before the judges. The tribunal met in emergency session to hear claims by the 18-party opposition coalition that Milosevic's cronies manipulated election results by using a sophisticated software program, a copy of which opposition leaders claimed to have obtained. Even before the court ruling, passions were high. Zoran Zivkovic, the mayor of Nis, the nation's third largest city, said any violence on the part of Milosevic's forces Thursday would be met by violence from crowds. \"I'm telling the army and police that we won't stop,\" said Zivkovic, addressing 30,000 anti-Milosevic demonstrators in Nis on Wednesday. \"We are going to Belgrade to finish off what we had started in the elections.\" Before the court's decision was announced, top opposition figures had been buoyed by the police capitulation at the Kolubara mine complex. They rushed to join more than 10,000 protesters there and openly predicted Milosevic's quick demise. \"Serbia has risen so that one man would leave,\" Kostunica told cheering workers and their supporters at the Kolubara mine near Lazarevac, about 25 miles south of Belgrade. Opposition leaders issued an ultimatum for Milosevic to resign by 3pm on Thursday - the time set for the Belgrade rally. \"This flame will engulf the whole of Belgrade,\" said Vladan Batic, an opposition leader. Police in riot gear had occupied the strip mine complex in an attempt to break up the largest of the nationwide strikes against Milosevic, but were unable to contain a swelling crowd that heeded the workers' cry for help. With sunset approaching, the police gave up. Most police withdrew from their barricades and mingled with strikers inside the compound. The mine walkout was the forerunner of other strikes; state telecommunications company workers announced they would stay away from work, and city bus drivers and garbage collectors in Belgrade also refused to work. It is the first widespread strike action in Yugoslavia's 55-year history. In an open letter to Milosevic, Kostunica said, \"It will be better for you to recognize electoral defeat or risk the danger of open clashes nationwide.\" Even before the court ruling, however, Milosevic, showed no signs he was contemplating defeat. His prime minister, Momir Bulatovic, repeated the position that Milosevic can remain in office until June 2001 regardless of the election outcome.",

      "bodyText": "Michael Heseltine last night launched his most ferocious attack on William Hague when he compared the Euroscepticism of the Tory leadership to the stance adopted by Labour's \"extreme left\" in the early 1980s. In a major escalation of the Tory civil war over Europe, the former deputy prime minister said that his party had embraced the \"psychology of the empty chair\" which would damage Britain. The man who made his name spearheading the Tory attack on the Labour party of Michael Foot declared: \"The last time so substantial an abdication of British interests was advocated by a major political party occurred when the extreme left ran the Labour party in the early 1980s.\" His remarks, at a dinner organised by the \"wet\" Tory Reform Group, were designed to inflict maximum damage to the Conservative leadership which has become even more Eurosceptic at this year's party conference. Mr Hague underlined the new lurch to the right yesterday by embracing a Danish politician linked to extreme right wing parties in Europe. Mr Heseltine was careful not to mention Mr Hague by name last night. But it was clear that he had the Tory leader in mind when he pointed out that today's party was out of step with every Conservative prime minister since Harold Macmillan. The former deputy prime minister told the dinner in Bournemouth: \"It would be a curious volte-face now if the Conservatives - who have alone carved out Britain's present relationship with Europe - were to proclaim that Macmillan, Home, Heath, Thatcher and Major shared in common the fact that they had got it all wrong. \"The prospect of victory for our party at the next election can be much enhanced by attracting back to ourselves those who listened and were convinced by the advice about our role in Europe of all our post-war Conservative prime ministers.\" Mr Heseltine dismissed Eurosceptic objections to the single currency, voiced during yesterday's foreign affairs debate at the conference. \"To suggest that the euro zone is to become a boom and bust economy is to ignore Britain's remarkable post-war record of achieving just that reputation, long before the euro was a serious reality,\" he said. Mr Heseltine's provocative suggestion that today's Tories are in the same mould as the Labour party of the 1980s - which wanted to withdraw from the EEC - will deal a severe blow to Mr Hague. The former deputy prime minister is still widely respected on all wings of the party for his successful crusade against the Labour in the early 1980s over the party's support for nuclear disarmament, nationalisation and opposition to the EEC. Mr Heseltine's speech last night was designed to be the high point of a fightback by the pro-Europeans at this year's Tory conference. The Heseltine wing had planned to keep its powder dry, but decided to take on the leadership after Mr Hague's recent mini-manifesto warned that the EU could cause the \"destruction of Britain\". The new shift to the right on Europe was demonstrated in yesterday's foreign affairs debate when William Hague warmly shook the hand of the Danish politician Claus Bunk Pedersen who played a leading role in the recent No campaign in the Danish referendum on the euro. Mr Pedersen is a former chairman of the European Young Conservatives which has links to the Italian Alleanza Nazionale party which describes itself as \"post fascist\". Mr Pedersen, who received a standing ovation, declared that Mr Hague was a statesman of \"first rank\". The shadow foreign secretary, Francis Maude, won loud applause when he said that Tony Blair wanted to force Britain into a \"European superstate\". Mr Maude attempted to mock the EU by pointing out that it had recently passed a directive which would tell people how to climb a ladder. His criticism backfired last night when it emerged that two Tory Euro MPs voted for the directive. The West Midlands MEP Philip Bushill-Mathews even tried to strengthen the directive. Keith Vaz, the Europe minister, last night accused Mr Maude of making a serious gaffe. \"Francis Maude's gaffe would be laughable if the issue wasn't so serious,\" he said. \"There are around 90 industrial fatalities a year involving falls from heights in Britain. It is right that proposals should be looked at to prevent these tragic accidents.\"",

The band was called Oasis and would go on to earn a multi-million pound fortune for the artists and their record companies. Adam Driscoll made three quid. </p> <p>Such was the lot for music promoters in the days before the internet. Spot all the talented bands, and allow the record companies to make all the money. </p> <p>But Channelfly has an interesting proposition. What if it had filmed that famous Oasis gig and acquired the rights from an unsigned band hungry for recognition? What if it then put the film for sale on the internet and charged Oasis's millions of fans two quid each to download the whole concert? </p> <p>Nearly eight years later and Driscoll is now chief executive of <a href=\"http://www.Channelfly.com\" target=\"_new\">Channelfly.com</a>, a rapidly expanding internet and music group that employs 53 people. The company has enjoyed a successful summer, acquiring the Student Broadcast Network (a network of 49 college stations) and hosting a Channel 4 late night music show, the Barfly Sessions held at The Monarch, the venue where Oasis first played that fateful gig. </p> <p>By night, a visit to The Monarch in Camden is deceptive. To the naked eye it looks like a large pub, with lots of trendy exposed brick and a modest stage. But remote-controlled cameras are hidden away in the ceiling and the pub also houses a 24 track sound desk, vision mixers and separate production room upstairs. </p> <p>\"The first thing we did,\" says Driscoll, \"was install cameras into the venue.

      "bodyText": "In September 1994, Adam Driscoll gave an unsigned band from Manchester their first London gig. The band was called Oasis and would go on to earn a multi-million pound fortune for the artists and their record companies. Adam Driscoll made three quid. Such was the lot for music promoters in the days before the internet. Spot all the talented bands, and allow the record companies to make all the money. But Channelfly has an interesting proposition. What if it had filmed that famous Oasis gig and acquired the rights from an unsigned band hungry for recognition? What if it then put the film for sale on the internet and charged Oasis's millions of fans two quid each to download the whole concert? Nearly eight years later and Driscoll is now chief executive of Channelfly.com, a rapidly expanding internet and music group that employs 53 people. The company has enjoyed a successful summer, acquiring the Student Broadcast Network (a network of 49 college stations) and hosting a Channel 4 late night music show, the Barfly Sessions held at The Monarch, the venue where Oasis first played that fateful gig. By night, a visit to The Monarch in Camden is deceptive. To the naked eye it looks like a large pub, with lots of trendy exposed brick and a modest stage. But remote-controlled cameras are hidden away in the ceiling and the pub also houses a 24 track sound desk, vision mixers and separate production room upstairs. \"The first thing we did,\" says Driscoll, \"was install cameras into the venue. Not webcams, but proper TV cameras. There no point in building an archive of material if it ends up looking like someone recorded it at home.\" Driscoll began archiving the bands last summer. Nearly 200 different bands play at the venue each year, but the first band he chose to archive was the then unknown Coldplay. Needless to say, they went on to have a number one album.

First, was Adam created simply to cure his sister? Is this an instance of breaking the golden principle that a human being should never be used as a means to an end (however noble that end is, as in the case of saving Molly Nash's life)?

      "bodyText": "The touching photos of Adam Nash cradled in the arms of the sister whose life he has perhaps saved, have prompted not delight but panic. It centres on three moral issues. First, was Adam created simply to cure his sister? Is this an instance of breaking the golden principle that a human being should never be used as a means to an end (however noble that end is, as in the case of saving Molly Nash's life)? The answer is unknowable - who can know the inner workings of a couple's decision to have a child? In recent years, other parents of sick children in need of transplants have made exactly the same decision as the Nashes and have had another child naturally.

      "bodyText": "The government will announce plans today to ban tobacco advertising and sponsorship as the World Health Organisation piles on the pressure for an official inquiry into smuggling allegations against the tobacco giants. Public health minister Yvette Cooper is to promise legislation to significantly curb cigarette promotion within hours of the European Court of Justice ruling unlawful a Brussels directive intended to achieve the same end. A bill is expected in the Queen's Speech next month to fulfill Labour's manifesto commitment to end advertising, with a fierce debate underway in Whitehall over whether motor racing and snooker should retain controversial three-year extensions. Under a European Union proposal, the two sports could have continued taking tobacco money until 2006 rather than the 2003 deadline for other sectors after lobbying by Downing Street. Labour was forced to return a \u00a31m gift, and turn down a second, after it emerged the money had been donated by Formula One mogul Bernie Ecclestone who stood to gain a small fortune from the extension. Downing Street is believed to be torn between treating the grand prix industry like all other sectors to \"draw a line\" under the Ecclestone affair and sleaze accusations or sticking with the longer period, fearing a shorter timescale could damage the sport. The Commons health select committee supports a tougher line with motor racing. The World Motor Sport Council of the International Automobile Federation last night announced it would impose its own ban on tobacco advertising and sponsorship from 2006. The EU directive is expected to be struck out by the court on technical grounds after the commission introduced it under EU single market legislation rather than as a health and safety issue. The commitment to outlaw advertising comes as a senior WHO official urged ministers to investigate evidence that British American Tobacco and other companies have profitted hugely from smuggling. The Commons health committee proposed a Whitehall inquiry earlier this year, but BAT, which set up an internal inquiry after the Guardian published internal documents, is lobbying against an investigation. David Yach, director of the WHO's programmes on non-communicable diseases, said: \"By forcing prices down, large-scale cigarette smuggling is contributing to the growth of smoking in developing countries.\"",

He made astute appointments, and his well-informed love of music and good liturgy, together with clear, intelligent preaching, made it a natural setting for his gifts. His personality and sensitive leadership enabled a varied group of individuals to work well together.</p> <p>Seven months after going to Worcester, his mother and aunt, with whom he had lived all his life and to whom he was utterly devoted, died. Then he was diagnosed with throat cancer. For a long time he totally lost his voice, and it was four years before he was able to use it properly.</p> <p>As dean he restored the fine Norman crypt, previously a store-room, but now regarded as the finest part of the cathedral. He also oversaw many imaginative projects to mark the diocese's 1,300th anniversary.</p> <p>Tom Baker was an only child in a house of nine adults, including grandparents on both sides and aunts, in Southampton. He was educated at the local King Edward VI School, Exeter College, Oxford, and Lincoln Theological College. He served his title at All Saints, Kings Heath, Birmingham. He was then sent to revive St James, Edgbaston, which he did.</p> <p>From 1954 to 1960 he was sub-warden of Lincoln Theological College, and from 1960 until 1971 he was principal of Wells Theological College. Re-shaping the worship at Wells in a way that was at once modern and classically Christian, taking Wells staff to Taiz\u00e9 in Burgundy and other places of Christian excellence on the continent, it was the most creative and influential period of his life.</p> <p>He persuaded the cathedral chapter to let the college use the undercroft for worship. In this in-the-round setting, worship that was well ordered, attentive and reflective of the concerns of the world was insisted on.

      "bodyText": "When Tom Baker, who has died aged 79, was Dean of Worcester, from 1975-1986, his was said to be the happiest cathedral in England. He made astute appointments, and his well-informed love of music and good liturgy, together with clear, intelligent preaching, made it a natural setting for his gifts. His personality and sensitive leadership enabled a varied group of individuals to work well together. Seven months after going to Worcester, his mother and aunt, with whom he had lived all his life and to whom he was utterly devoted, died. Then he was diagnosed with throat cancer. For a long time he totally lost his voice, and it was four years before he was able to use it properly. As dean he restored the fine Norman crypt, previously a store-room, but now regarded as the finest part of the cathedral. He also oversaw many imaginative projects to mark the diocese's 1,300th anniversary. Tom Baker was an only child in a house of nine adults, including grandparents on both sides and aunts, in Southampton. He was educated at the local King Edward VI School, Exeter College, Oxford, and Lincoln Theological College. He served his title at All Saints, Kings Heath, Birmingham. He was then sent to revive St James, Edgbaston, which he did. From 1954 to 1960 he was sub-warden of Lincoln Theological College, and from 1960 until 1971 he was principal of Wells Theological College. Re-shaping the worship at Wells in a way that was at once modern and classically Christian, taking Wells staff to Taiz\u00e9 in Burgundy and other places of Christian excellence on the continent, it was the most creative and influential period of his life. He persuaded the cathedral chapter to let the college use the undercroft for worship. In this in-the-round setting, worship that was well ordered, attentive and reflective of the concerns of the world was insisted on. Students also encountered biblical scholarship that was, to many, startlingly radical, and which set out to relate Christian truth to a culture rapidly moving away from traditional signposts. With a growing number of older ordinands who had not studied for many years, seminars were carefully shaped to give them selective reading and focused questions. Another feature of the college was the emphasis on small groups. Every student had to belong to a house group with regular meetings, and there were in addition other special groups in which the psycho-dynamics of life together could be experienced and ex plored.

      "bodyText": "BA last night suspended 11 pilots and three cabin crew following allegations that they had breached the company's strict rules about drinking alcohol before flights. In a move which could result in a strike of its 3,500 pilots, BA said the staff involved had been removed from duty pending the outcome of an internal investigation. They face dismissal if the allegations are proved. David Hyde, BA's director of safety, said: \"We take any potential breach of regulations very seriously. We have launched a formal investigation and have notified the Civil Aviation Authority.\" The allegations are made in a Channel 4 Dispatches programme due to be screened next week. BA said it had asked the makers of the documentary to hand over any evidence that will assist the investigation. The allegations refer to staff employed on short haul flights from Europe to Gatwick over a period of several months earlier this year. The drinking incidents were mainly at European hotels and the three cabin crew members are said to have included at least one stewardess. Under BA's rules, staff are only allowed to drink in moderation in the 24 hours before a flight and are not permitted any alcohol in the eight hours before reporting for duty or while on duty. Staff were suspended on Friday, immediately after Channel 4 contacted BA, although it is understood that BA warned staff a month ago of the documentary team's activity. Mr Hyde said that the company had to act swiftly because the safety of passengers and its aircraft was a priority. \"These allegations surprise us, but we are erring on the side of caution in removing staff from duty while the investigations are carried out,\" he declared. He stressed that all BA flights are recorded so that management can monitor the behaviour of crews on duty. \"This enables us to identify drunken driving, and there is no suggestion that safety was compromised on any of the flights that followed these alleged drinking incidents,\" he said. Mr Hyde refused to release the names of the staff involved because none of the allegations have been proven. But the airline pilots' union, Balpa, is furious that at least one former BA cabin crew member took part in the programme, drinking with ex-colleagues while filming took place. Christopher Darke, Balpa's general secretary, attacked the programme for its \"underhand and disgraceful journalistic methods, which could be described as entrapment.\" He went on: \"Channel 4 has used ex-cabin crew members to befriend, entice and entrap flight and cabin crew, then filmed them secretly without their knowledge and consent.

The four UK networks now have 34m customers between them, equivalent to more than one per household. </p> <p>The blistering pace of growth has been driven by pre-pay services which allow users to keep a tighter grip on costs by replacing monthly bills with credit vouchers. </p> <p>Pre-pay has broadened the appeal of mobile phones to lower income groups and to new age groups. Parents now commonly buy pre-pay services for their children to keep them in touch without the threat of spiralling bills. Last week a report suggested that children were now spending more on their mobile phones than anything else. </p> <p>In the last quarter, One2One, the traditional laggard of the four networks, managed to win the most customers, adding 1.1m new users. Of these, 98% were on pre-pay and 2% on contract. </p> <p>Industry pundits said the figures could be inflated by some users owning more than one phone. </p> <p>Mobile phone companies have become extremely hot properties. In a mark of the growth of the sector, Vodafone has become the largest company in the country, worth some \u00a3154bn. It is bigger than the oil company BP Amoco at \u00a3138bn and dwarfs British Telecom which is worth a mere \u00a347bn. </p> <p>An Orange spokesman said: \"A few years ago people were still debating how many people would have mobile phones and how often would they use them. </p> <p>It is now pretty well accepted that in the next couple of years virtually everyone in this country will own a mobile phone. The debate is no longer about will it happen but how long it will take.\" </p> <p>In Finland, which has embraced mobile phones more keenly than anywhere else, 80% own mobile phones. The US, unusually, is far behind Europe due to the lack of national networks, older technology and the legacy of a system where the person receiving the call had to pay for it. </p> <p>Vodafone remains the biggest network in Britain with 10.2m customers following the three-month period to the end of September in which it added 877,000. </p> <p>BT Cellnet is the second largest with 8.7m, Orange is a close third with 8.3m and One2One has 7.1m. Virgin Mobile which launched last year on the One2One network now has more than 400,000 customers. </p> <p>The introduction of Wap (wireless application protocol) phones this year, providing very basic internet access, has also driven new handset sales. </p> <p>Although they were met with a lukewarm reception, Wap services are expected to improve rapidly. The government has just auctioned the next generation of mobile phone spectrums which will allow internet access at higher speeds than conventional modems, CD-quality sound and the arrival of video phones. The five licences went under the hammer for \u00a323bn and services are expected to start in 2002/3.</p>",

Pre-pay has broadened the appeal of mobile phones to lower income groups and to new age groups. Parents now commonly buy pre-pay services for their children to keep them in touch without the threat of spiralling bills. Last week a report suggested that children were now spending more on their mobile phones than anything else. In the last quarter, One2One, the traditional laggard of the four networks, managed to win the most customers, adding 1.1m new users. Of these, 98% were on pre-pay and 2% on contract. Industry pundits said the figures could be inflated by some users owning more than one phone. Mobile phone companies have become extremely hot properties. In a mark of the growth of the sector, Vodafone has become the largest company in the country, worth some \u00a3154bn. It is bigger than the oil company BP Amoco at \u00a3138bn and dwarfs British Telecom which is worth a mere \u00a347bn. An Orange spokesman said: \"A few years ago people were still debating how many people would have mobile phones and how often would they use them. It is now pretty well accepted that in the next couple of years virtually everyone in this country will own a mobile phone. The debate is no longer about will it happen but how long it will take.\" In Finland, which has embraced mobile phones more keenly than anywhere else, 80% own mobile phones. The US, unusually, is far behind Europe due to the lack of national networks, older technology and the legacy of a system where the person receiving the call had to pay for it. Vodafone remains the biggest network in Britain with 10.2m customers following the three-month period to the end of September in which it added 877,000. BT Cellnet is the second largest with 8.7m, Orange is a close third with 8.3m and One2One has 7.1m. Virgin Mobile which launched last year on the One2One network now has more than 400,000 customers. The introduction of Wap (wireless application protocol) phones this year, providing very basic internet access, has also driven new handset sales. Although they were met with a lukewarm reception, Wap services are expected to improve rapidly. The government has just auctioned the next generation of mobile phone spectrums which will allow internet access at higher speeds than conventional modems, CD-quality sound and the arrival of video phones. The five licences went under the hammer for \u00a323bn and services are expected to start in 2002/3.",

One of the most uncomfortable subjects in politics surfaced again this week, when a bitter accusation of inter-generational rivalry was made at the Conservative party conference in Bournemouth. Women who had tried unsuccessfully for selection as parliamentary candidates described the difficulties they faced in finding seats, claiming inexperienced men were often \"parachuted in\" to winnable constituencies.</p> <p>The harshest words came from 32-year-old pharmacist Fiona Guest, who placed the blame for the Tories' poor record in selecting female candidates squarely on other women. \"It's the old ladies on the selection committees, to put it bluntly,\" she said on Monday, confirming the stereotype of Tory ladies as upper-middle-class housewives in floral dresses with a weakness for personable men.</p> <p>Her comments follow criticism of Betty Boothroyd, the Labour MP who recently stood down as Speaker of the House of Commons, by colleagues who felt she had not been sufficiently supportive of women. Boothroyd annoyed younger female MPs when she banned breastfeeding in working areas of the house; one unnamed MP recently told the Daily Telegraph there was a \"real undercurrent of bitterness\" among female colleagues about her performance as Speaker.</p> <p>Yet the claim that Boothroyd dislikes women has been denied by MPs as diverse as Diane Abbott and cabinet office minister Mo Mowlam; the latter has expressed gratitude to Boothroyd for the practical help she offered when Mowlam was being treated for a brain tumour. It certainly looks as though some sections of the media, after praising Boothroyd to the skies when she announced she was to stand down, have done a characteristic volte-face and begun to look for ammunition against her.</p> <p>It is this undeniable undertow of misogyny in public life that makes it all the harder to disentangle accusations about \"Queen Bee\" syndrome - the theory that older women resent their younger colleagues and sometimes deliberately hold them back.</p> <p>That it happens can be demonstrated in two words: Margaret Thatcher. The former prime minister's record of excluding other women was extraordinary and left a legacy that is still being felt today. Over a period of 11 years, she appointed only two other women to her cabinets, creating an experience gap so severe that John Major apparently could not find any suitably-qualified women to serve in his own first cabinet. Thatcher seems to have been one of those women who revels in her uniqueness, relishing her role in a way that actually set back the cause of women in the Conservative party, an ironic bequest from Britain's first female PM.</p> <p>But, according to Fiona Guest, there are plenty more women like her in today's Tory party. \"There are still women who don't want women to be MPs and turn down able women,\" she insists. \"I know. I have sat on selection committees.\"</p> <p>Mary-Ann Stephenson, director of the Fawcett Society, confirms that this theory is widely held. \"The tradition has always been that it was men who blocked women in the Labour party and women who blocked them in the Conservative party.\"</p> <p>Now, though, she thinks Conservative men are just as likely to stand in the way of women candidates. \"People may be more aware when women do it,\" she says, \"because of the expectation that women should promote and encourage other women. But I do think there's a generational shift in the Conservative party. The older generation have traditional views, such as the idea that women have children at a young age and should wait until they grow up. But the age at which people have children is going up.\"</p> <p>The new generation of Conservative women consists of professionals, who are the least likely of any group to take time off from their careers, turning traditional Tory thinking on its head. \"They go back to work very quickly,\" Stephenson points out. \"They expect to be able to win seats.\"</p> <p>That a gap is opening up between these women and their older colleagues is indicated by recent remarks from Gillian Shepherd, a former Tory minister. If conditions in the House of Commons are unacceptable to parents of young children, she said, \"then it is better to wait to get elected until it is an easier proposition\". Was she suggesting William Hague take a break from parliament if he and Ffion have babies? It seems unlikely.</p> <p>No wonder the Conservative party is uncomfortable with the entire subject, with some female MPs acknowledging the problem but without coming up with much in the way of remedies. As a direct result, the overall number of women in the Commons is actually expected to fall at the next general election as Labour women in marginal constituencies lose their seats and are replaced by Tory men. In a parliamentary democracy in which women make up less than 20% of MPs, this is an indictment of the Conservatives' selection process as well as infuriating for the party's would-be women candidates.</p> <p>There is some evidence, though, that generational conflicts extend beyond the confines of the Conservative party. Some women Labour MPs oppose Gwyneth Dunwoody, the leading female contender to replace Boothroyd as Speaker, and say they want a modernising candidate. (Dunwoody has said she would support the existing ban on breastfeeding.) There are genuine disagreements between women MPs who came into parliament 20 or 30 years ago, determined to show they could succeed on the same terms as men, and younger women - perhaps more directly influenced by feminism - who do not see why they should accept working conditions that favour men.</p> <p>It is hard to avoid the conclusion that, not just in parliament, women from different generations have yet to learn to live with each other and avoid the kind of rivalry that leads to gleeful headlines. Part of this is accounted for by Stephenson's point about expectations: a bad male boss is seen as a bad boss, whereas a woman who abuses her authority over younger female employees is viewed very much in terms of her gender. Nor is it the case that the hostility is all one-way, with some younger feminists showing themselves all too eager to dismiss the achievements of older writers and activists.</p> <p>Some of these conflicts are real, others may be due to lack of communication. Anna Coote, a long-time feminist and editor of New Gender Agenda, recalls a recent meeting, organised by the Fawcett Society, that brought together women of different generations. \"The disagreements are blown up,\" she says. \"We found we agreed on practically everything.\"</p> <p>This may be true of women on the centre-left, who have been grappling with the competing demands of work and family for several decades. Although some women Labour MPs are unhappy with their working conditions, the party currently has 101 of them, compared with the Conservatives' 14.

Mr Bush spent the day campaigning in Pennsylvania, while Mr Gore travelled to Ohio, both key battleground states. Early polls yesterday showed the Democratic vice-president making inroads among undecided voters in the aftermath of the head-to-head meeting, which drew an estimated audience of more than 60m viewers. A poll of debate-watchers for CBS News showed that 56% thought Mr Gore performed better than his rival, compared with 42% for Mr Bush. A similar survey for CNN had Mr Gore with a 48%-41% advantage on debate performance, while an NBC poll gave Mr Gore a 46%-36% margin. The first of this autumn's three presidential debates will certainly have put to rest the facile notion that the 2000 election is a contest between indistinguishable candidates with a common philosophy. In 90 minutes of often fact-filled debate at the University of Massachusetts on Tuesday night, Mr Gore and Mr Bush set out starkly different approaches to the role of government in domestic and international affairs. They repeatedly drew the battle lines on issues ranging from tax cuts to abortion, and from protection of the environment to Balkans peacekeeping. Yesterday's press reactions were predictably varied. Mr Bush \"held his own in the first match\", the Dallas Morning News concluded; \"Bush got his clock cleaned\", the online magazine Slate decided; The Washington Post judged that \"both candidates cleared the bar of minimum requirements\", while the Los Angeles Times said: \"If the race is based on this debate, it remains a squeaker.\" There were \"surprisingly few of the usual gaffes and zingers that the public usually remembers from debates\", the New York Times said. \"Instead the powerful impression was of two advocates of different views of government.\" Only in the closing exchanges did the debate turn anything like personal, as Mr Bush launched an attack on his opponent's character and trustworthiness with regard to campaign fundraising. Mr Gore refused to be drawn into a personal exchange this time, but he may find such abstinence harder in the next debate on October 11. Mr Gore spent most of the evening playing to his strengths as a man familiar with the details of policy and experienced in government and foreign policy. He reeled off a bewildering list of figures on his and Mr Bush's tax plans, health-spending proposals and pension plans. Asked about the situation in Serbia, the vice-president talked crisply about President Slobodan Milosevic, Montenegro and opposition leader Vojislav Kostunica, words which the syllabically challenged Republican candidate carefully avoided pronouncing, probably wisely. Neither man made more than a passing mention of President Bill Clinton, but Mr Bush repeatedly tried to present himself as an outsider, presenting his lack of Washington experience as an asset, not a liability. \"You've had your chance, and nothing has been done,\" Mr Bush told his opponent. Before the debate began, Mr Gore's press spokesman Chris Lehane promised a contest between \"two competing visions, one for the many, the other for the few\". It was a characterisation that Mr Gore repeatedly asserted throughout the longest single section of the debate, a back-and-forth on the candidates' tax and spending plans. \"He would spend more money on tax cuts for the wealthiest 1% than all of the new spending that he proposes for education, healthcare, prescription drugs and national defence combined,\" Mr Gore charged. In an echo of a key issue from the past two presidential elections, the two candidates revealed sharp disagreements about abortion, with Mr Gore supporting women's rights to choice and Mr Bush defending \"life for the unborn\". With the next president perhaps having the opportunity to fill as many as four vacancies on the nine-member US supreme court during the coming years, the issue of abortion was \"on the ballot in this election\", Mr Gore claimed.

      "byline": "Stephen Moss",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Stephen Fry is quite clear about what he is. It's there in the first line of his entry in Who's Who: \"writer, actor, comedian\". That probably reverses the public perception of Fry, whose blustering generals and bloodthirsty monarchs have made him television's favourite barmy buffer. But writing is not a sideline: he is a proper writer, not a celebrity with a word processor. </p> <p>The Stars' Tennis Balls (hideous title but a pertinent quote from The Duchess of Malfi), which is published today, is his fourth novel. Add his well-received memoir, Moab Is My Washpot, and Paperweight, a 470-page collection of his journalism, and he has something resembling an oeuvre. To have produced such a volume of work at the age of 43 is impressive enough; to have done it while appearing in films and on TV, as well as developing a curious role as linchpin of British national life (his close friends number everyone from Prince Charles to Peter Mandelson), is extraordinary. </p> <p>I was watching a banal TV biog of Sir John Mills the other day, and who should pop up giving his pennyworth but Fry, separated from \"Johnny\" by 50 years but still apparently a close chum. Fry is a fixture on such programmes, just as he is a regular - always polished and funny - on chat shows. He is one of those clever people who uses ubiquity to ensure that you never find out anything about them. </p> <p>As his output would suggest, Fry is stupendously well organised. He has his laptop (he is crazy about software) and a constantly ringing mobile that plays The Ride of the Valkyries (he is crazy about Wagner). He also has a cold, but he's a trouper and can still apostrophise through the sneezes and wheezes. A Fry soliloquy is something to behold, words, ideas and quotations tumbling out in torrents. The third playing of The Ride of the Valkyries prompts me to ask him about Wagner and, in turn, music. He becomes animated and I am engulfed. </p> <p>\"I am a very emotional person, and music was the thing that always made it gush out. Music has a particular access to one's emotional self that is at a far deeper level than any other art form. Eliot said it was the deepest of the arts and deep beneath the arts, and that seems to be true. I suppose it's because it's abstract, it's not about anything, so it's not mediated or palliated by the dirt of actual reference. A word is more or less a token - poets are always struggling with the words they're having to use. I think it was Rilke who said that 'language is the universal whore that I must make into a virgin'. Musicians don't have to do that: they don't have to use language, the diminished currency of everyone. Because music isn't about anything, it can be about everything.\" </p> <p>When Fry was on remand for credit card fraud as a teenager (you surely know all that stuff from chat shows and the memoir), his fellow inmates called him \"the professor\". His alter ego on Radio 4's Loose Ends was Dr Donald Trefusis, Carnegie professor of philology at Cambridge. In his journalism (mainly columns he wrote for the Listener and the Daily Telegraph), he uses the word \"banausian\" with a remarkable, indeed tiresome, frequency. You get the point: he is a crazy prof, in fact and fiction. </p> <p>The new novel, a reworking of The Count of Monte Cristo (readers will be invited to spot the similarities), falls into the category of good read rather than great book, pacy, well constructed and rather gruesome. If one were to make a criticism, one might say that it was a trifle banausian. It works like clockwork, but one does not buy a novel to tell the time. </p> <p>When celebrities write novels, it is often the celebrity that gets reviewed rather than the novel. Should he perhaps publish them pseudonymously, as Don Trefusis, say? \"It is the dearest dream of one's bosom for it to be reviewed as a novel, not a Stephen Fry novel, but you can't keep it a secret, and then it looks like a form of vanity. I do receive letters from people who are only dimly aware that I've popped my face on the screen, particularly from abroad. In the US and Germany they have no sense of me as a person. </p> <p>\"I've got less self-conscious about it. I used to feel incredibly embarrassed if I went to a dinner party and there was a 'real' novelist there.

      "bodyText": "Stephen Fry is quite clear about what he is. It's there in the first line of his entry in Who's Who: \"writer, actor, comedian\". That probably reverses the public perception of Fry, whose blustering generals and bloodthirsty monarchs have made him television's favourite barmy buffer. But writing is not a sideline: he is a proper writer, not a celebrity with a word processor. The Stars' Tennis Balls (hideous title but a pertinent quote from The Duchess of Malfi), which is published today, is his fourth novel. Add his well-received memoir, Moab Is My Washpot, and Paperweight, a 470-page collection of his journalism, and he has something resembling an oeuvre. To have produced such a volume of work at the age of 43 is impressive enough; to have done it while appearing in films and on TV, as well as developing a curious role as linchpin of British national life (his close friends number everyone from Prince Charles to Peter Mandelson), is extraordinary. I was watching a banal TV biog of Sir John Mills the other day, and who should pop up giving his pennyworth but Fry, separated from \"Johnny\" by 50 years but still apparently a close chum. Fry is a fixture on such programmes, just as he is a regular - always polished and funny - on chat shows. He is one of those clever people who uses ubiquity to ensure that you never find out anything about them. As his output would suggest, Fry is stupendously well organised. He has his laptop (he is crazy about software) and a constantly ringing mobile that plays The Ride of the Valkyries (he is crazy about Wagner). He also has a cold, but he's a trouper and can still apostrophise through the sneezes and wheezes. A Fry soliloquy is something to behold, words, ideas and quotations tumbling out in torrents. The third playing of The Ride of the Valkyries prompts me to ask him about Wagner and, in turn, music. He becomes animated and I am engulfed. \"I am a very emotional person, and music was the thing that always made it gush out. Music has a particular access to one's emotional self that is at a far deeper level than any other art form. Eliot said it was the deepest of the arts and deep beneath the arts, and that seems to be true. I suppose it's because it's abstract, it's not about anything, so it's not mediated or palliated by the dirt of actual reference. A word is more or less a token - poets are always struggling with the words they're having to use. I think it was Rilke who said that 'language is the universal whore that I must make into a virgin'. Musicians don't have to do that: they don't have to use language, the diminished currency of everyone. Because music isn't about anything, it can be about everything.\" When Fry was on remand for credit card fraud as a teenager (you surely know all that stuff from chat shows and the memoir), his fellow inmates called him \"the professor\". His alter ego on Radio 4's Loose Ends was Dr Donald Trefusis, Carnegie professor of philology at Cambridge. In his journalism (mainly columns he wrote for the Listener and the Daily Telegraph), he uses the word \"banausian\" with a remarkable, indeed tiresome, frequency. You get the point: he is a crazy prof, in fact and fiction. The new novel, a reworking of The Count of Monte Cristo (readers will be invited to spot the similarities), falls into the category of good read rather than great book, pacy, well constructed and rather gruesome. If one were to make a criticism, one might say that it was a trifle banausian. It works like clockwork, but one does not buy a novel to tell the time. When celebrities write novels, it is often the celebrity that gets reviewed rather than the novel. Should he perhaps publish them pseudonymously, as Don Trefusis, say? \"It is the dearest dream of one's bosom for it to be reviewed as a novel, not a Stephen Fry novel, but you can't keep it a secret, and then it looks like a form of vanity. I do receive letters from people who are only dimly aware that I've popped my face on the screen, particularly from abroad. In the US and Germany they have no sense of me as a person. \"I've got less self-conscious about it. I used to feel incredibly embarrassed if I went to a dinner party and there was a 'real' novelist there. I would think they had every reason to think 'I saw your window display in Waterstone's, you bastard, while my literary masterpiece sits on the back table'. Now I have to accept the fact that I can never be quite sure why people read the books.\" Might the writing, as the Who's Who hierarchy suggests, displace the acting? \"I cordon off some time to write a book, so I take on nothing at all for these months. I just cannot write and act at the same time. I can't be halfway through a chapter and then go off and act. I have to become completely lost in it. But to be only a writer would drive me mad. I'm a pretty social animal a lot of the time and writing is such an isolated business that if that was my only work I don't know how I'd cope.

What seems to have been crucial was an ability to survive cooling temperatures and, perhaps, to exploit unusual food resources. Amphibians may have survived because of their ability to hibernate or to enter a state of torpor. When the temperature drops they become dormant but remain alive. Dinosaurs did not have this ability. The small mammals alive at this time did not hibernate, but had insulating fur and could burrow underground. Much remains to be understood about this mass extinction, but most of those who perished were large-bodied animals - none survived beyond the Cretaceous period. </p> <p> Mark Swindale, Brodick, Arran. </p> <p> <b> In Mel Brooks' film The History of the World: Part I, Moses descends from Mount Sinai and drops a third tablet of stone, so destroying commandments 11-15.

If that doesn't work, don't apologise. <br> 14. If forced to apologise, don't resign. <br> 15. If forced to resign, get a good book deal. </p> <p> Charles Harris, London NW3. </p> <p>\u0095 11.

If we were all wiped out in a nuclear blast when the clock struck midnight, then it would have been a rip-off. </p> <p> Martin Baloch, Manchester. </p> <p>\u0095 I work as a programmer for a company that produces business software. During 1998 and 1999, I spent 13 months doing Y2K remedial work, as did many others at the company. Our software is heavily date-dependent. If we hadn't done this work, our software would not have been able to function on January 1 2000 (and would have barely functioned from January 1 1999, because of the need to calculate annual renewal dates). </p> <p>The job involved checking thousands of programs containing an average of 5,000 lines of code each. Each data item and procedure had to be checked to see if it contained or influenced dates. Every change carried with it the possibility of an introduced error. Everything then had to be tested thoroughly. This had to be done while normal development of the systems was continuing. This story was repeated all over the world. That is where those \"billions\" went: companies spending large sums of money on a task that added no value to the systems except to keep them going. </p> <p>By the way, the story about Italy only spending a few million pounds is not true. That figure represented the government's spend on Y2K awareness. Their spend on remedial work was comparable to Britain's. It is a tribute to the hard work of software professionals that large-scale disruption was avoided. However, when I see comments like those of the questioner, I begin to wish there had been a few disasters. </p> <p> T J Mason, Halifax, W Yorks. </p> <p> <b> On a map of the Bering Strait, at the tip of Alaska's Seward Peninsula, are the names Wales and Cape of Prince of Wales. Why are they there?</b> </p> <p> \u0095 Cape Prince of Wales, the western extremity of Alaska, was named by Captain Cook on his third and final voyage in search of the North West Passage in 1778-79. As he had to invent many thousands of names for newly discovered features, it is not surprising that some of them lack originality, and he probably had few opportunities to ask the local people what names they had for geographical features as he was sailing past but not landing. The town of Wales did not exist at that time, at least under that name. </p> <p> Ted Webber, Cairns, Australia. </p> <p> <b> On the eastbound carriageway three miles west of M4 junction 13 is a large exit labelled Works Access Only.

But he will search in vain for evidence to support his allegation of US government involvement. I was a Ministry of Transport civil servant involved in advising ministers on the route. The heaviest lobbying came from the racehorse trainers and members of the House of Lords - who seemed to form the majority of the population of the \"royal\" county of Berkshire - but there was not a word from Dr Strangelove. </p> <p>The Welford depot was served by the truncated remains of the Lambourn railway branch line. This closed to passengers in 1960 but the Newbury-Welford section remained open specifically to serve the base, and this continued after the adjacent section of the M4 was opened in 1971. I understand the decline of British rail freight in the mid-1970s led to the US forces' wish to shift the traffic to road, leading to the building of the slip road and closure of the railway. This may be the source of Mr Batts's unfounded suspicion. </p> <p> Reginald Dawson, Tywyn, Gwynedd. </p> <p> <b> Why do I have nightmares if I sleep on my back?</b> </p> <p> \u0095 At the Arnhem Open Air Museum in Holland, I saw a reconstructed Friesland house and was surprised to find that Frieslanders slept in upright beds in small cubicles.

Perhaps the questioner is descended from Dutch fisherfolk? </p> <p> Ted Wilson, Bramhall, Cheshire. </p> <p> <b> The recent forest fires in the western United States were described as the worst for 50 years. The same was said about the disastrous floods in Mozambique earlier this year. What happened to the weather 50 years ago, and was it caused by global warming?</b> </p> <p> \u0095 Contrary to the scaremongering reports one often sees in the media, there is no evidence to suggest that such weather-related extremes are due to global warming either now or in the past. Extremes have occurred in the past naturally and are likely to do so in the future.

      "bodyText": "Caught in the slipstream of an accelerating scientific and social revolution, the nine-year-old agency set up to regulate Britain's test tube baby clinics, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, was beginning to look its age yesterday. As the HFEA attempted to deal with the Mastertons' accusations - and digest the consequences of \"designer babies\" in Illinois - the head of one of Britain's leading IVF clinics said he supported the Scottish couple's case for choosing the sex of their baby, and blamed the authority for knocking the couple \"from pillar to post\". Simon Fishall, who runs the Centre for Assisted Reproduction at the Park Hospital in Nottingham, painted a Kafkaesque picture of the plight of the Mastertons, caught in a maze of buck-passing ethical bodies. He contradicted the HFEA's statements that the Mastertons had been unable to get any of the five specially licensed IVF clinics in Britain to agree to the procedure. His comments highlighted the growing dissatisfaction among British IVF practitioners at the caution and long decision making process at the HFEA. \"I think that gender selection is very much a case by case issue and in this particular case, the Mastertons have my support, because of the circumstances,\" he said. \"I suspect - and I may be wrong - our clinic may well have treated them had the HFEA been supportive.\" Dr Fishall said the couple had initially approached the HFEA because the agency was carrying out a public consultation exercise on gender selection at the time. The HFEA told them to approach the clinics. Although Dr Fishall was supportive, he had to put the application to his own, local ethical committee. Because the HFEA had not come down one way or the other, the local committee said no. \"I think the HFEA's passing of the buck at that stage was wrong,\" he said. An HFEA spokesman said general policy only allowed couples to choose the sex of their child if there was a hereditary medical problem that was more likely to be passed on to one gender over another. The authority is now under pressure on several fronts. Besides the Mastertons' legal challenge, a number of IVF clinics want to get HFEA licences to carry out procedures similar to the \"designer baby\" technique used to help the Nash family in Illinois. In that case, which was made public on Tuesday, a couple had a baby son by IVF techniques who had been genetically selected, at the embryo stage, to have bone marrow capable of saving his baby sister. The head of another British IVF clinic, Paul Serhal of University College Hospital, said yesterday that he would like to carry out a similar procedure to help sufferers from a genetic blood disease called thalassemia, which affects people of Mediterranean ancestry. One of the results of thalassemia is that sufferers experience a decline in fertility, so many go for IVF as a matter of course, he said. At present, Mr Serhal's clinic is licensed to screen IVF embryos of affected couples to select those which do not have the disease gene. But he could, if the HFEA agreed, carry out a second screening, to make sure that the child born would have a particular blood type which could be transfused into the father to cure them. \"This is not done routinely, which I find extraordinary,\" he said. \"It is not as if we would be disfiguring or dismembering a child. \"The point is we are already carrying out genetics tests on embryos for patients at risk of genetic illness. If at the same time we do a genetic test for a potential cure for the father, I can't see anything wrong with that.\" Mr Serhal said he had not applied to the HFEA for a licence for this type of testing before because of fears he would not be able to get the agreement of all the many individual doctors and scientists involved in the clinic's IVF programme. But he said it was time for an effort to get a licence. \"I will definitely do whatever is possible to convince some of my colleagues that, in selected cases, where patients are already having IVF, this would be acceptable.\" However Mr Serhal was against the idea of testing embryos to choose the sex of a child, even in the Mastertons' case. \"In this particular case, they are talking about replacing a dead child, and you can't replace a dead child,\" he said.",

Operation Halifax, performed after consultation with those who led the Fred West investigation, included an exhaustive search of three back gardens in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, because of fears a body may have been buried there. The operation, which involved sniffer dogs and 40 officers working with ground penetrating radar, was called off last night when no human remains were found. The twin move by detectives followed a 10-month investigation sparked by claims from a 38-year-old woman who told police she was held hostage in a house in Gladstone Street, Peterborough, for most of 1999. As the inquiry progressed, a 30-year-old man and a 23-year-old woman came forward alleging they were also abused in the house on separate occasions between 1984 and 1992. Officers broadened the inquiry in the summer when the 38-year-old woman remembered one of her alleged captors referring to a body hidden in the back garden. Six people - four men and two women - were arrested when they appeared voluntarily at Bridge Street police station in Peterborough yesterday. A police spokesman said they were being questioned about allegations of assault and cruelty, and an allegation that a body had been concealed. Another man was arrested at his home in the city. He was also being questioned about alleged concealment of a body. The seven are believed to have lived in two of the terraced houses in Gladstone Street. The third house is unoccupied. Detective Chief Inspector Dick Harrison, who is leading the inquiry, ordered the search as a precaution. Six small areas were dug up yesterday under the supervision of Corrinne Duhig, a forensic archaeologist from Cambridge University. \"We have found no evidence to support suggestions there are human remains in these gardens,\" said Mr Harrison.",

The governments would be looking at ways of forcing out Mr Milosevic after his disastrous showing in last month's presidential election.</p> <p>Mr Dienstbier, who has a reputation for being outspoken, suggested that the price of immunity was worth paying to free Serbia from Mr Milosevic.</p> <p>He told reporters in Prague: \"The only possible deal, and the most important thing for Mr Milosevic, is to have guarantees that if he leaves power, he will not be prosecuted and will not spend the rest of his life somewhere in prison.\"</p> <p>He added: \"The real question is if we are more interested in Milosevic . . . or the future of 10m Serbs and probably the Balkans.\"</p> <p>His remarks raised suspicion that whatever the west might be saying publicly, in private a deal was in the offing.</p> <p>But Mr Annan said Mr Dienstbier had been speaking in a personal capacity and \"did not represent the views of the secretary general\". He added that no one other than the prosecutor had the authority to withdraw indictments.</p> <p>A Foreign Office source said there was no shift in the British position. \"We are not in the business of doing deals with Milosevic.

      "bodyText": "The United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, rebuked his special envoy to Yugoslavia, Jiri Dienstbier, last night for proposing that President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia should be offered immunity from prosecution for war crimes. Mr Dienstbier, the UN human rights representative in the region and a former Czech foreign minister, held out the prospect of the deal in return for Mr Milosevic standing down as president. Immunity would wreck the Balkans war crimes tribunal in the Hague and undermine the proposed international criminal court, which is being set up in an attempt to ensure leaders cannot escape prosecution for human rights abuses. If Mr Milosevic, who has been indicted by the UN for war crimes, escaped prosecution, it would be hard to sustain the case against others accused of war crimes in the Balkans, such as Radovan Karadzic, the former Bosnian Serb leader, and the Bosnian Serb General Ratko Mladic, who is wanted for genocide. The row over the indictment came as the US indicated that a meeting of the Contact Group on the Balkans - the US, Russia, Britain, Germany, France and Italy - was being planned for this week. The governments would be looking at ways of forcing out Mr Milosevic after his disastrous showing in last month's presidential election. Mr Dienstbier, who has a reputation for being outspoken, suggested that the price of immunity was worth paying to free Serbia from Mr Milosevic. He told reporters in Prague: \"The only possible deal, and the most important thing for Mr Milosevic, is to have guarantees that if he leaves power, he will not be prosecuted and will not spend the rest of his life somewhere in prison.\" He added: \"The real question is if we are more interested in Milosevic . . . or the future of 10m Serbs and probably the Balkans.\" His remarks raised suspicion that whatever the west might be saying publicly, in private a deal was in the offing. But Mr Annan said Mr Dienstbier had been speaking in a personal capacity and \"did not represent the views of the secretary general\". He added that no one other than the prosecutor had the authority to withdraw indictments. A Foreign Office source said there was no shift in the British position. \"We are not in the business of doing deals with Milosevic. He should be held to account in the Hague.\" Jim Landale, a spokesman for the UN tribunal's panel of 14 judges, described Mr Dienstbier's remarks as \"extremely disturbing\". He, too, stressed that the indictment could only be withdrawn by a judge at the request of the UN chief prosecutor, Carla del Ponte. Ms Del Ponte said Mr Dienstbier had no authority to propose a deal. She was at present working to expand the indictment to include even more charges of war crimes. Russia has invited both Mr Milosevic and Vojislav Kostunica, who won last month's election, to Moscow to discuss the impasse. The US has said that if Mr Milosevic sets foot in Moscow, Russia, as a member of the UN, should hand him over for prosecution. Russian officials warned yesterday that any western attempt to thwart Mr Milosevic's arrival would be viewed as a \"hostile step\" and stressed that he would not be arrested as a war criminal if he did arrive. Mr Kostunica also insisted that he would not hand over Mr Milosevic to the UN war crimes tribunal. The Russian foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, said Mr Putin's offer on Monday to host the two Serbian rivals in mediation talks in Moscow still stood. But neither man has officially responded to Mr Putin's offer and the chances of a Moscow summit appeared to be receding. Dmitry Rogozin, the head of the Russian parliamentary affairs committee, criticised the west's calls for Russia to arrest Mr Milosevic. \"On the one hand the west is secretly urging Russia to influence the political situation in Yugoslavia, which is possible only within the limits of political dialogue, and on the other has publicly announced that Milosevic has to be arrested and tried,\" he said. He accused the west of hypocrisy and said there was no chance of Moscow handing Mr Milosevic over to the Hague. In an interview with a Russian newspaper, Mr Kostunica said he would not hand over Mr Milosevic. \"Because this tribunal is a political and not a legal institution. Because this conflicts with my sense of truth and justice. Because this is against the position of Yugoslavia. \"I could continue this list, but the Hague tribunal is not my main worry,\" he said.",

      "bodyText": "Slobodan Milosevic's political allies in Montenegro dealt the Yugoslav president a blow yesterday, saying they had not yet decided whether to take part in a second round of presidential elections. Arguing that the people of Serbia had clearly signalled a desire for change, the deputy chairman of Montenegro's Socialist People's party (SNP) called on Mr Milosevic to reach a compromise with the opposition regarding the contested vote. \"I am worried and not very happy about what is happening in Serbia,\" Predrag Bulatovic said. Mr Milosevic has insisted that a runoff ballot is needed in the presidential battle, rejecting assertions by the opposition leader, Vojislav Kostunica, that his party won an outright majority in the September 24 vote. Without saying so directly, Mr Bulatovic indicated that he thought Mr Milosevic was in the wrong. \"It is obvious the people of Serbia want a change,\" he said. Asked whether he was disappointed by the Yugoslav president's reaction to the poll, he said Mr Milosevic was facing his first election defeat. \"Everyone needs to get used to losing if they are a democrat,\" Mr Bulatovic said. Montenegro is Serbia's last remaining partner in Yugoslavia and the SNP is the republic's only mainstream party to back Mr Milosevic. The party's popularity has fallen in recent years thanks to its close links to the Serbian strongman, and it is currently languishing in opposition in the republic's parliament. Montenegro's pro-western government boycotted last month's elections, claiming the ballot was illegal; turnout in Montenegro was just 28.5%, with 91.5% of votes going to Mr Milosevic's party. The Serbian opposition has offered to make Mr Bulatovic prime minister if the SNP abandons Mr Milosevic ahead of the second-round vote, scheduled for October 8. A tired and pale-looking Mr Bulatovic said he was not interested in the position and added that his party had already agreed that its leader and current federal prime minister, Momir Bulatovic, should stay on in the post. However splits are opening within SNP ranks. Momir Bulatovic, no relative of Predrag, announced on Monday he thought a second-round vote should take place. However, the party's executive board met the same day and failed to agree on the need for a runoff ballot. Another meeting is due in the next 48 hours. \"It is a very complex situation. We don't know if there will be a second round and we have still not decided if we shall participate in it,\" Predrag Bulatovic said, adding that continued election controversy would fuel secessionist fires in Montenegro. He urged Mr Milosevic and Mr Kostunica to work out their differences, saying that if needed the Serb Orthodox Church or Russia could mediate. \"A compromise would be a great step forward for our democracy, but compromises are very rare among politicians of our country,\" he said.

      "bodyText": "A chemical used in 90% of suntan lotions worldwide might be toxic, according to new research by a team of Norwegian scientists. And exposure to the sun could make the UVB filter octyl methoxycinnamate (OMC) even more deadly, according to a report published in New Scientist magazine. Tests conducted by the Norwegian radiation protection authority found that half of mouse cells died when they came into contact with a weak dose of OMC, at a much lower concentration than is used in most of the world's sunscreens. Shining a lamp on the OMC-impregnated cells, to simulate sunshine, made the chemical twice as deadly. NRPA biophysicist Terji Christensen warned sunbathers to use sunscreens with caution. The Cosmetic Toiletry and Perfumery Association said OMC had been \"thoroughly tested for safety\".",

      "bodyText": "Plants grown in contaminated soil near the Chernobyl nuclear power station in Ukraine have mutated at a much faster rate than expected. Researchers from Switzerland, Britain and Ukraine warn in an article in the latest edition of the journal Nature that their experiments show that the effects of radiation on plants are not well understood and may be more severe than was previously thought. The scientific team, led by Olga Kovalchuk from the Friedrich Miescher Institute in Basel, planted identical crops of wheat in two locations - one on a highly radioactive plot close to Chernobyl, the other in uncontaminated but otherwise similar soil 19 miles away. They then grew further crops from the seeds of each set of wheat. Even though the plants close to the nuclear power station were exposed to radiation for only 10 months, the genes of the crop raised from this seed showed a sixfold increase in the mutation rate compared with the normal wheat. What alarmed the scientists was that the wheat growing in the radioactive area was exposed to relatively low doses of radiation. \"This low-level exposure should not cause such a large increase in the mutation rate, suggesting that chronic exposure to ionising radiation has effects that are as yet unknown,\" they wrote in Nature. The scientists do not believe the mutations could have been caused directly by a weak blast of radiation hitting the plants' DNA. They suspect that some so far unidentified mechanism is affecting genes by upsetting the delicate mechanism of the plant cells as a whole. The findings have troubling implications for future generations of plants, animals and humans living in and around the Chernobyl contamination zone, created in 1986 when one of the four reactors on the site exploded. So far the only undisputed medical effect of the disaster has been a big rise in the number of cases of child and adolescent thyroid cancer in the regions of Ukraine, Belarus and Russia adjacent to Chernobyl. But scientists fear that the worst consequences of Chernobyl will only emerge in future generations. The disaster has had mixed consequences for the environment around the power station. In the short term the area, evacuated of human beings, has become a haven for wildlife. The danger now is from clumps of radioactive particles which were blown across Ukraine and Belarus by the wind and fell to earth. But the of radioactive mutations - the generation of hideous monsters and giant insects - is unlikely to occur, since even with radiation speeding up changes in DNA, it would still take many generations for evolution to pick out useful new genes which would enable new species to emerge and survive.",

Francis Maude, the shadow foreign secretary, made a similar plea for inclusivity to Portillo's on the same day. He too has been on what Mr Portillo called a long journey: his gay brother died of Aids.

Tory MPs are also increasingly aware that another reason for keeping him is that the post-Hague leadership battle would probably be Portillo against Widdecombe. Under Mr Hague's own rule book activists would then ballot on the winner. That is the underlying signficance of this week's conference beauty parade. \"They'd pick Ann,\" murmur alarmed MPs.</p> <p>John Redwood, ousted, then reinstated and still ambitious, is instinctively a Widdecomber. So is smooth Iain Duncan Smith, the Tory defence spokesman for whose speech Lady Thatcher got up early for, a sign of favour. He wants the armed forces exempt from the Human Rights Act, he said this week.</p> <p>Andrew Lansley, the shadow cabinet's policy wonk, is a Tebbit protege. Other lesser lights think that way and many party activists and voters. Above all Miss Widdecombe - 53 yesterday - articulate, feisty, brave and rightwing, shows increasing signs of believing her own publicity.</p> <p>Could I be leader, she must ask herself in the mirror ? Why not, Margaret was, comes back the answer. Is Miss Widdecombe, for all her popular virtues, the politician to take the Tories back to power? MPs ask each other. No. Tony Blair would be delighted by the prospect. So the Widdecombe-Portillo spat has one immediate benefit. It helps secure Mr Hague in his job.</p> <p><b>Libertarians v authoritarians</b></p> <p><b>Opposing voices in the Tory ranks</b></p> <p><b> Michael Portillo</b><br> \"We are a party for people, not against people.

Under Mr Hague's own rule book activists would then ballot on the winner. That is the underlying signficance of this week's conference beauty parade. \"They'd pick Ann,\" murmur alarmed MPs. John Redwood, ousted, then reinstated and still ambitious, is instinctively a Widdecomber. So is smooth Iain Duncan Smith, the Tory defence spokesman for whose speech Lady Thatcher got up early for, a sign of favour. He wants the armed forces exempt from the Human Rights Act, he said this week. Andrew Lansley, the shadow cabinet's policy wonk, is a Tebbit protege. Other lesser lights think that way and many party activists and voters. Above all Miss Widdecombe - 53 yesterday - articulate, feisty, brave and rightwing, shows increasing signs of believing her own publicity. Could I be leader, she must ask herself in the mirror ? Why not, Margaret was, comes back the answer. Is Miss Widdecombe, for all her popular virtues, the politician to take the Tories back to power? MPs ask each other. No. Tony Blair would be delighted by the prospect. So the Widdecombe-Portillo spat has one immediate benefit. It helps secure Mr Hague in his job. Libertarians v authoritarians Opposing voices in the Tory ranks Michael Portillo \"We are a party for people, not against people. We are for all Britons: black Britons, British Asians, white Britons. Britain is a country of rich diversity... We are for people whatever their sexual orientation. The Conservative party isn't merely a party of tolerance: it's a party willing to accord every one of our citizens respect.\" October 3 2000 Francis Maude \"Our party has always contained its representative share of gays, including my late brother. A national party has to be serious about being inclusive and tolerant. Tolerance is not an optional addition to this party's values; it is an absolutely vital part of it which sustains us.\" October 3 Steven Norris Policies such as support for section 28 are no more than \"homophobic nonsense - and the gay community know it.\" October 4 2000 Ann Widdecombe \"I have never quite been sure what is meant by that phrase social tolerance. What I believe is that the state should have a preferred model, that it should promote the traditional family.\" October 4 2000 Iain Duncan Smith On gays in the forces: \"I believe, as the previous government did, that we should follow the advice of the armed forces, which has always been that lifting the ban would adversely affect operational effectiveness.\" January 2000",

      "bodyText": "Over the past year we've launched a rash of initiatives to get the UK online by 2005. A big part of this has been measures to improve government's web presence and the services we provide (Web-master-general, October 3). On September 11, the prime minister launched UK online, backed up by \u00a31bn in funding to get government online as well as people and business. The centrepiece is a new report, e.gov: electronic government services for the 21st century. It puts in place incentives, levers and institutional structures to make sure the transformation happens in Whitehall. A third of government services are already online. These are being improved, and new ones developed all the time. Within the next year you will be able to learn subjects like maths and Japanese; apply for Employment Service jobs; and forecast your pension online. The quality of our sites is improving at pace. New guidelines on navigation, design and access have been welcomed by the private sector and organisations like the Royal National Institute for the Blind. Ian McCartney MP Cabinet Office minister \u0095 The suggestion that FT.com turned down an offer to outsource our site development and pressed ahead with doing the job ourselves, with the assistance of some small subcontractors, is simply wrong (Notebook, October 3). Huw van Steenis of JP Morgan named FT.com as one of the few European websites that were better than their US equivalents. Visits to the site and advertising revenues are two to three times higher than a year ago. Every day 1.5m FT.com pages are seen by 140,000 users. Our site is visited by over 1m individuals per month. This is one of Britain's great internet success stories. Peter Martin Editorial director, FT Internet Activities",

      "body": "<p>One of cinema's greatest tale-tellers, it's easy to imagine that spaghetti western maestro Sergio Leone would have been a hoot when it came to inventing bedtime stories. In fact, though, when someone happened to find the director sending one of his girls to the land of nod while making For A Few Dollars More, they didn't hear him intoning a story, but words of fiscal wisdom. </p> <p>\"The first thing to learn\", Sergio told the kid, \"is never put a cent of your own money into a picture.\" It's advice that Dwight Yoakam may soon wish someone had given him at a formative age. Because the country singer recently sold his $825,000 Malibu home to help finance the movie South Of Heaven, West Of Hell, which he wrote, directed and stars in alongside Billy Bob Thornton, Vince Vaughn and Bridget Fonda. The movie, Yoakam's debut stab at directing, finds him playing a veteran of the Spanish Civil War, and was apparently inspired by Westerns like One-Eyed Jacks and Pat Garrett And Billy The Kid - neither of which, it has to be said, exactly set box-office cash tills ringing when they were originally released. </p> <p>And Yoakam isn't the first person to fund a movie out of his own pocket. </p> <p>Indeed, unless they already have some development deal it's customary for producers to pay seed money for scripts, location-scouting and a lot of expensive lunches in the hope that this will impress the money men enough to sign on the dotted line. When Untouchables producer Art Linson was trying to persuade Universal to pony up for his Hunter S Thompson adaptation Where The Buffalo Roam, for example, he paid for the notorious gonzo journalist to stay in a pricey LA hotel. It was a decision that soon began to melt his Amex card, as Linson recalls in his autobiography A Pound Of Flesh: \"The first thing I noticed in the room was a gashing four-inch hole in the wall by the side of a picture above the couch. 'What's with the hole?' I shouted through to the bedroom where [Thompson] had gone to change. 'It was an accident.' He reappeared holding a gun. 'This wasn't supposed to carry past 15 feet.' He walked off seven paces from the wall, turned, and fired. Another gaping hole blasted through the wallpaper. 'Christ', he said, 'these specifications can't be trusted.' My hand instinctively reached for my wallet.\" </p> <p>Of course, helping to finance a film can also enable film-makers to keep control of their movies. A theory most recently proven by James Cameron, who initially agreed to waive his titanic Titanic fee when it looked like the ship was about to go down with a brace of movie companies on deck. </p> <p>\"Yeah, that definitely shows the advantages of putting in our own money,\" agrees British producer Gregor Truter, who's just completed his debut movie Lava. \"Because once it stops being one man's vision, that becomes a very dangerous situation. Once it becomes filming by committee you're in all sorts of trouble. I mean, I didn't like Titanic, but it is Cameron's vision. Funnily enough I saw it with Leslie Grantham, who's in Lava, and if he doesn't like a film he just starts talking. With about 20 minutes to go Leslie was going, 'Oh dear, oh fucking dear. Go on, hurry up and fucking drown.'\" </p> <p>The downside to this strategy is that if the film fails at the box office then the director stands to lose far more than just their reputation. It was just such a scenario that confronted Francis Ford Coppola during the production of Apocalypse Now - a film whose spiralling budget United Artists only agreed to finance as long as he put up pretty much everything he owned as collateral. While the film would show a profit, the pressures inherent in taking this risk are more than apparent in Apocalypse's accompanying documentary Hearts Of Darkness. </p> <p>\"Yeah, that rant he has when he says it's all a disaster is one of the most scary bits of film I've ever seen,\" says Truter. \"It's like a horror film to me. I just hope I'm never in that situation.\" But what, then, is a film-maker like Dwight Yoakam supposed to do if he simply runs out of money? </p> <p>\"Well, it obviously helps if you've got a house worth $825,000,\" Truter laughs. \"But I would suggest that trying to pay for it yourself is a particularly stupid thing to do. If you have a proven track record, like Steven Spielberg, I'd say fair enough. But your first feature... Well, I'd say good luck. And, you know, good on Dwight for having that kind of blind faith. I don't mean to do him down. But after the first day of shooting, blind faith means nothing.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "One of cinema's greatest tale-tellers, it's easy to imagine that spaghetti western maestro Sergio Leone would have been a hoot when it came to inventing bedtime stories. In fact, though, when someone happened to find the director sending one of his girls to the land of nod while making For A Few Dollars More, they didn't hear him intoning a story, but words of fiscal wisdom. \"The first thing to learn\", Sergio told the kid, \"is never put a cent of your own money into a picture.\" It's advice that Dwight Yoakam may soon wish someone had given him at a formative age. Because the country singer recently sold his $825,000 Malibu home to help finance the movie South Of Heaven, West Of Hell, which he wrote, directed and stars in alongside Billy Bob Thornton, Vince Vaughn and Bridget Fonda. The movie, Yoakam's debut stab at directing, finds him playing a veteran of the Spanish Civil War, and was apparently inspired by Westerns like One-Eyed Jacks and Pat Garrett And Billy The Kid - neither of which, it has to be said, exactly set box-office cash tills ringing when they were originally released. And Yoakam isn't the first person to fund a movie out of his own pocket. Indeed, unless they already have some development deal it's customary for producers to pay seed money for scripts, location-scouting and a lot of expensive lunches in the hope that this will impress the money men enough to sign on the dotted line. When Untouchables producer Art Linson was trying to persuade Universal to pony up for his Hunter S Thompson adaptation Where The Buffalo Roam, for example, he paid for the notorious gonzo journalist to stay in a pricey LA hotel. It was a decision that soon began to melt his Amex card, as Linson recalls in his autobiography A Pound Of Flesh: \"The first thing I noticed in the room was a gashing four-inch hole in the wall by the side of a picture above the couch. 'What's with the hole?' I shouted through to the bedroom where [Thompson] had gone to change. 'It was an accident.' He reappeared holding a gun. 'This wasn't supposed to carry past 15 feet.' He walked off seven paces from the wall, turned, and fired. Another gaping hole blasted through the wallpaper. 'Christ', he said, 'these specifications can't be trusted.' My hand instinctively reached for my wallet.\" Of course, helping to finance a film can also enable film-makers to keep control of their movies. A theory most recently proven by James Cameron, who initially agreed to waive his titanic Titanic fee when it looked like the ship was about to go down with a brace of movie companies on deck. \"Yeah, that definitely shows the advantages of putting in our own money,\" agrees British producer Gregor Truter, who's just completed his debut movie Lava. \"Because once it stops being one man's vision, that becomes a very dangerous situation. Once it becomes filming by committee you're in all sorts of trouble. I mean, I didn't like Titanic, but it is Cameron's vision. Funnily enough I saw it with Leslie Grantham, who's in Lava, and if he doesn't like a film he just starts talking. With about 20 minutes to go Leslie was going, 'Oh dear, oh fucking dear. Go on, hurry up and fucking drown.'\" The downside to this strategy is that if the film fails at the box office then the director stands to lose far more than just their reputation. It was just such a scenario that confronted Francis Ford Coppola during the production of Apocalypse Now - a film whose spiralling budget United Artists only agreed to finance as long as he put up pretty much everything he owned as collateral. While the film would show a profit, the pressures inherent in taking this risk are more than apparent in Apocalypse's accompanying documentary Hearts Of Darkness. \"Yeah, that rant he has when he says it's all a disaster is one of the most scary bits of film I've ever seen,\" says Truter. \"It's like a horror film to me. I just hope I'm never in that situation.\" But what, then, is a film-maker like Dwight Yoakam supposed to do if he simply runs out of money? \"Well, it obviously helps if you've got a house worth $825,000,\" Truter laughs. \"But I would suggest that trying to pay for it yourself is a particularly stupid thing to do. If you have a proven track record, like Steven Spielberg, I'd say fair enough. But your first feature... Well, I'd say good luck. And, you know, good on Dwight for having that kind of blind faith. I don't mean to do him down. But after the first day of shooting, blind faith means nothing.\"",

      "body": "<p>Mary Woronov is horizontal on a couch, and when she gets up to greet me something within it snaps from the stress. She has always been too much: too tall, too beautiful, too aggressive, too masculine. At school, she was too dangerous to be left alone with other children. As a teenager, her teeth were too crooked, and her mother forced them straight - wishing she could straighten her daughter out, too. </p> <p>Woronov's fine new novel, Snake, draws on such childhood details and on the LA debauchery that came later. But as her other new book, Swimming Underground: My Years in the Warhol Factory, makes clear, it was in mid-60s bohemian Manhattan that this constitutional excessive found a place to call home. She was a leather-clad whip-dancer for the Velvet Underground, a star of Chelsea Girls, ghosted past icons from Tennessee Williams to Dali, gobbled speed and saw her life as art. </p> <p>The near-fatal shooting of Warhol in 1968 spun her into other orbits: as the most rapaciously arrogant and serpentine of Roger Corman's B-movie queens (Death Race 2000, Rock'n'Roll High School), then a hard-partying, late-flowering punk, and a lead role in cult movie Eating Raoul. Painting and porn are on the CV, too, but these coolly sadistic, unpredictable books may be her peak. Now 57, a strange mix of mousy timidity, fierceness and unshielded honesty, impressions of the Factory flood from her, emotional imprints at odds with received history. </p> <p>It was Gerard Malanga - poet, photographer, film-maker - who seduced her into Warhol's world when she was a Cornell art student on a field trip to the Factory; the sight of his camera making sense of her life felt like a baptism. Usually, Billy Name (whose photographs illuminate Swimming Underground) was the one who procured \"superstars\" for the combustible assembly of breathing \"art objects\" Warhol surrounded himself with - the raw material for his movies. What were the criteria for being chosen? </p> <p>\"For one thing, you had to have a fair amount of amphetamine,\" Woronov smiles. \"For another thing, you had to have some kind of gender-slippage, or be very beautiful, like Nico. Surely that was her only talent. I didn't like her, she wasn't very nice. Or you had to be creative with your own body. Like Candy Darling, a man who decided - way before there was an operation to be had - to be this fabulous woman. You had to invent yourself. </p> <p>\"My qualification was that I was very timid about men. I wanted them so much I would imitate them - so I came in with a very masculine air, a very beautiful girl being masculine. Also, there was an innocence about me, and yet I had rage in me, a force-field around me that was violent, which I didn't know what to do with. Warhol figured it out really quickly. He put me in Chelsea Girls.\" </p> <p>Along with Ondine (aka The Pope, the Factory's most sardonically poisonous tongue), Woronov dominated Warhol's greatest movie, a sadistic, coiled bully, letting her violence loose on cowering fellow \"superstars\" Ingrid and Pepper. Her image - \"smouldering, imperious, articulate\", in the words of fan Camille Paglia - looks like a prototype for many women today. But even now, she can't see that she's feminine. </p> <p>\"I don't trust femininity,\" she says with a short, nervous laugh. \"I'm not maternal at all. I don't want children, and I never have. I think it's a sin to bear them. Especially into this world, where there's so much pain and grief. I would die if I made someone live in this world. I'd kill myself. I don't think I should've been put here. I don't see any point to this, I think this is hell. But nevertheless, I'm in it, and I do like the people in it. It's kind of a cruel joke that you just die at the end. I used to be very angry about that. But then, the sadness of old friends dying connects you to humanity. Which I wasn't before.\" </p> <p>Swimming Underground is full of cold fronts, deliberate disconnections from real emotion, as Woronov and the rest let their \"art-object\" existences consume them. You can see them in Billy Name's pictures, in love with each other's bohemian style, ignoring the seedy Manhattan scenes behind them. Woronov would snatch gulps of normal air, in a home she shared with a relatively straight friend. But, like so many 60s figures - Lennon, Kesey and Nixon as much as Warhol - she couldn't wait to get back to the cameras and tapes, the dangerously improvised movie in which the decade's famous seemed determined to star. </p> <p>\"Warhol had his recorder on all the time,\" she says. \"You didn't talk to him, you talked to it. It was easier not to see him and the rest as real people. At that time, I didn't see myself as a real person. My whole life was a performance. If we went somewhere with Warhol, we felt we were being watched, that we were on screen. Now, lots of people seem to feel that way. Then, it was unheard of. It made us feel like super-people, like everyone else was just an audience, that they had no rights. There are benefits to feeling that way. But there are things you leave behind. Like normal compassion.\" </p> <p>The book is at its most compulsive when detailing the self-destructive night-time roamings of this fragile, transgressive elite. Those who went furthest were nicknamed Mole People, pasty from lack of sunlight, tunnelling for new sensations. Warhol, too, when glimpsed, is \"white, empty, waiting to be filled\". Vampire Nest, Woronov calls her penultimate chapter. </p> <p>\"It always ended at dawn,\" she says. \"The city was like the end of the world then. Just before all these people who are not like you go to work and race along the street, there's a sense of the end. The fact that everybody is going to die, the fact that you're not really alive. It was an interesting sense, I liked it. I also remember sitting in rooms and realising it was dawn, and that I would have to stay because I couldn't face that mob. You had to hide because those people didn't understand you. You're an empty shell, you haven't eaten in four days, you can't think, you have this bizarre voice rattling in your head like a broken egg. I mean, you must take cover. Or else, get another shot. </p> <p>\"I didn't like getting another shot, others did, and they really cracked. But my main drug was amphetamine, and I liked coming down from it. It's like the phone is off the hook, and you're still walking around. You get very cold inside, your body feels electric and everything matters. It was like going back to the grave, to sleep.\" </p> <p>The reasons why they pioneered such risky lives, in such an inhospitable era is obscure. But Warhol was their presiding spirit. \"He was fearless,\" Woronov says. \"Especially with the movies. People called them stupid and ugly and boring. But it didn't bother him at all. All those things were just fine. Which made you wonder about him. So, fine, we thought, we'll go with you.\" </p> <p>And, once inside his Factory walls, there were times, for this misfit band, when the tightrope lives they were walking seemed almost blessed. \"We weren't interested in each others' personal problems. I had a lot of them then, but I would forget them when I was with Warhol. And we became this bizarre in-crowd. God only knows why, because there were a lot of boring hours. But we did consciously keep up a certain image, we consciously mocked people. We had nothing to lose - we were outsiders. Everybody hated us anyway. But together, they were afraid of us. All of a sudden, they weren't picking on us, they were moving back.

      "bodyText": "Mary Woronov is horizontal on a couch, and when she gets up to greet me something within it snaps from the stress. She has always been too much: too tall, too beautiful, too aggressive, too masculine. At school, she was too dangerous to be left alone with other children. As a teenager, her teeth were too crooked, and her mother forced them straight - wishing she could straighten her daughter out, too. Woronov's fine new novel, Snake, draws on such childhood details and on the LA debauchery that came later. But as her other new book, Swimming Underground: My Years in the Warhol Factory, makes clear, it was in mid-60s bohemian Manhattan that this constitutional excessive found a place to call home. She was a leather-clad whip-dancer for the Velvet Underground, a star of Chelsea Girls, ghosted past icons from Tennessee Williams to Dali, gobbled speed and saw her life as art. The near-fatal shooting of Warhol in 1968 spun her into other orbits: as the most rapaciously arrogant and serpentine of Roger Corman's B-movie queens (Death Race 2000, Rock'n'Roll High School), then a hard-partying, late-flowering punk, and a lead role in cult movie Eating Raoul. Painting and porn are on the CV, too, but these coolly sadistic, unpredictable books may be her peak. Now 57, a strange mix of mousy timidity, fierceness and unshielded honesty, impressions of the Factory flood from her, emotional imprints at odds with received history. It was Gerard Malanga - poet, photographer, film-maker - who seduced her into Warhol's world when she was a Cornell art student on a field trip to the Factory; the sight of his camera making sense of her life felt like a baptism.

      "body": "<p>The Royal Collection has not been in the news much since Anthony Blunt, then Surveyor of the Queen's Pictures, was unmasked as a Soviet spy in 1979. Until now. It was announced last week that a new art gallery is to be created at Holyrood Palace in Edinburgh to display works (primarily drawings) from the Royal Collection. It will open in 2002, together with a modernised Queen's Gallery at Buckingham Palace, in what appears to be an attempt to rebrand this fabulous art collection as a public benefit rather than a private perk. </p> <p>It's not good enough. The Queen's is the last of the royal art collections formed in the period between the 17th and 19th centuries to remain in royal hands; it includes the world's most significant archive of drawings by Leonardo da Vinci - from his anatomical study of a baby in the womb to sketches for The Last Supper - as well as works by Rembrandt, Michelangelo, Raphael, Brueghel, Holbein, Titian, Lorenzo Lotto, Jacopo Bassano, Lucas Cranach... It is, in short, one of the world's great art collections, scattered throughout the royal palaces. </p> <p>The only way the Queen can do justice to the Royal Collection is to give it to us. Give it up, or at least, give up the paintings. The Royal Collection also includes armour, furniture and clocks; you name it, some Royal over the years collected it. They can keep most of that - though the British Museum or the V&amp;A might welcome a nice 18th-century clock. But it's unacceptable that the Royal Family should hold some of the most important paintings and drawings in the world \"in trust\" for a nation that is, by implication, incapable of looking after these things for itself. Surely we're grown up now. </p> <p>We have the best-run, most accessible public museums in the world, still mostly free of charge (which Royal galleries cannot be because the Royal Collection is funded from royal revenues). Yet London's National Gallery is a comparatively small museum with approximately 2,000 paintings collected by the museum since its foundation in 1824. This makes it very different from the Louvre in Paris or the Prado in Madrid, which have far bigger collections. The reason is simple: the Louvre and the Prado have at their core the collections of the French and Spanish monarchies, inherited long ago by modern nation states. The Louvre became a public museum and its art was nationalised in 1792, the fruit of the French Revolution; the Prado was established by King Ferdinand in 1819 as a museum of painting and sculpture from royal acquisitions. The National Gallery would be hugely enriched by some of the Queen's paintings. The same goes for the National Gallery of Scotland and every public collection in Britain. </p> <p>You could argue that palaces are not bad places to keep paintings. The ones at Hampton Court can be seen permanently and others, such as Rembrandt's 1642 Self-Portrait, which was lent to the National Gallery's Rembrandt exhibition last year, can be glimpsed from time to time. </p> <p>Glimpsed, when they should be on permanent view at public art galleries. To visit Hampton Court costs \u00a310.50; people go to see the Maze, the kitchens, the Real Tennis court. No one goes just to see the paintings; the day I went, the Renaissance Gallery was emptier than Tate Britain on a wet Monday morning. </p> <p>Even more alarming is the treatment of a work such as Artemisia Gentileschi's Self-Portrait as the Allegory of Painting, a Baroque masterpiece. You can see it, if you can find it, at Hampton Court. It hangs in a side-room, badly lit, inadequately labelled, with nothing to tell visitors it is worth looking at. Someone should tell the Surveyor of the Queen's Pictures, or the Surveyor of the Queen's Works of Art, or one of the other quaintly titled dignitaries who look after the Royal Collection, that Artemisia is special. The picture is treated as part of the palace decor, of less interest than the Tudor kitchens. </p> <p>\"Much of the Royal Collection is integral to the different royal palaces,\" says the collection's PR person Frances Dunkels, and if \"integral\" means displayed in such a way that a great painting is treated as a prop in a theatre of royal heritage, that's true. Some of the most important paintings in Britain hang at Hampton Court; Mantegna's Triumphs of Caesar, a sequence of history paintings that is one of the supreme masterpieces of the Renaissance, can be found in the palace gardens, where it is on display in the Orangery. In non-royal language, they keep it in the garden shed. You can buy only one postcard of a painting that is not a royal portrait in the shop, which is full of Queen Mum mugs and bottles of olde worlde mead. The problem with showing paintings in royal settings is that royalty determines how they are seen; a royal gallery is not, by definition, a public one. The spectacle of royalty subsumes everything and relegates even the greatest artists in history to a subordinate role in demonstrating the glory of the monarchy. If Leonardo da Vinci is displayed at Holyrood, his drawings will simply become part of the royal show. </p> <p>But the Royal Collection is part of our history as much as theirs; unless you believe in the divine right of monarchs, the Windsors have no more claim on paintings purchased in the early 17th century by Charles I than we do. The doomed king was an enthusiastic art collector; some of the finest paintings in the Royal Collection, including Mantegna's Triumphs of Caesar, come from the collection of the Dukes of Gonzaga in Mantua in northern Italy, which he bought wholesale in 1629. </p> <p> Charles's flamboyant love of art may even have contributed to the puritan loathing of him that got him executed. His collection is part of British history, far more than it is part of the family history of the Windsors, who displayed not the slightest intelligent commitment to expanding the collection in the 20th century. The last royal to have any energy or judgment as an art collector was Prince Albert. He added German Renaissance paintings to the collection, including a wonderful picture by Lucas Cranach the Elder. </p> <p>The Royal Collection has affected, and continues to affect, the way we experience art in Britain. There is a unique British snobbishness about painting that associates art appreciation with being upper crust, and has its corollary in a rejection of high art by people who don't feel it belongs to them. This goes right back to the 18th century when William Hogarth sneered at the philistine way in which aristocrats plastered the walls of their palaces with \"black masters\", Renaissance paintings darkened by time and candlelight which were collected only for their value. At Hampton Court some of the rooms even have simulated candlelight, so that the paintings by Renaissance masters on the walls cannot be seen properly in the \"atmospheric\" shadows. </p> <p>Because of the old snobbery that has surrounded high art in Britain, there is a false polarity of old and new. We feel that we possess new art, that it is for us and can be understood by us, whereas art history belongs to the ancien regime. What we need is something to make art from the past available to us, owned by us. The Queen could do a real public good by giving up the Royal Collection. It would be a world news sensation. It would make it harder for anyone to question the monarchy's modernity. Most of all, it would mean we could look at some of the greatest paintings and drawings in the world whenever we felt like it, at our leisure. We would all feel like monarchs. </p> <p>\u0095 Hampton Court Palace: 020-8781 9500.</p>",

The problem with showing paintings in royal settings is that royalty determines how they are seen; a royal gallery is not, by definition, a public one. The spectacle of royalty subsumes everything and relegates even the greatest artists in history to a subordinate role in demonstrating the glory of the monarchy. If Leonardo da Vinci is displayed at Holyrood, his drawings will simply become part of the royal show. But the Royal Collection is part of our history as much as theirs; unless you believe in the divine right of monarchs, the Windsors have no more claim on paintings purchased in the early 17th century by Charles I than we do. The doomed king was an enthusiastic art collector; some of the finest paintings in the Royal Collection, including Mantegna's Triumphs of Caesar, come from the collection of the Dukes of Gonzaga in Mantua in northern Italy, which he bought wholesale in 1629. Charles's flamboyant love of art may even have contributed to the puritan loathing of him that got him executed. His collection is part of British history, far more than it is part of the family history of the Windsors, who displayed not the slightest intelligent commitment to expanding the collection in the 20th century. The last royal to have any energy or judgment as an art collector was Prince Albert. He added German Renaissance paintings to the collection, including a wonderful picture by Lucas Cranach the Elder. The Royal Collection has affected, and continues to affect, the way we experience art in Britain. There is a unique British snobbishness about painting that associates art appreciation with being upper crust, and has its corollary in a rejection of high art by people who don't feel it belongs to them. This goes right back to the 18th century when William Hogarth sneered at the philistine way in which aristocrats plastered the walls of their palaces with \"black masters\", Renaissance paintings darkened by time and candlelight which were collected only for their value. At Hampton Court some of the rooms even have simulated candlelight, so that the paintings by Renaissance masters on the walls cannot be seen properly in the \"atmospheric\" shadows. Because of the old snobbery that has surrounded high art in Britain, there is a false polarity of old and new. We feel that we possess new art, that it is for us and can be understood by us, whereas art history belongs to the ancien regime. What we need is something to make art from the past available to us, owned by us. The Queen could do a real public good by giving up the Royal Collection. It would be a world news sensation. It would make it harder for anyone to question the monarchy's modernity. Most of all, it would mean we could look at some of the greatest paintings and drawings in the world whenever we felt like it, at our leisure. We would all feel like monarchs. \u0095 Hampton Court Palace: 020-8781 9500.",

Well, who knows?</p> <p>For these are missing children. They are children who have been abducted. They may have been kidnapped, or - most commonly - taken by one parent from the other. Sometimes they have just disappeared.</p> <p>It is every parent's ultimate horror and when, unimaginably, it happens it proves to be a horror that is compounded by helplessness. There seems to be nothing that can be done: the police, the courts, governments, international conventions - all are powerless. Ask Catherine Meyer. She knows. She has used every avenue to try to reach her two children taken in Germany more than six years ago - and as the wife of Sir Christopher Meyer, the British ambassador to the US, she has access to more avenues than most. Yet even the personal intervention of the US president, who approached the German chancellor, hasn't worked.</p> <p>It is that helplessness which is one reason why tonight, at the Savoy Hotel in London, Meyer has assembled a glittering cast for an American-style fund-raising ball to mark the official launch of the International Centre for Missing and Exploited Children. It is an organisation she has co-founded and which has just been awarded charitable status by the Charities Commission. Cherie Booth QC is the patron of the organisation in Britain and is speaking tonight; Hillary Clinton is in powerful support in the US and has sent a message for the programme. The Savoy will be heaving with child-friendly celebrities: Michael Douglas and Catherine Zeta Jones are promised, Michael Caine and Shakira, perhaps the Duchess of York; actors, politicians, lawyers, people of power and influence. The aim is to use their names and fame to highlight the issue.</p> <p>\"I have been through this nightmare and there is a real lack of awareness about it,\" says Meyer. Tonight she plans to change all that. In a fatalistic sort of way, she believes that perhaps it is her role now, given that her own children are gone. She hasn't given up on her own case, but after six years she wants to fight for other people's children, too. Her own story is a remarkable one. She lost everything in her fight for her children: job, home, car and savings but then met and married Christopher Meyer.</p> <p>\"When I arrived in Washington I didn't want anyone to know my story,\" she says. Soon, however, she realised she could use her standing to make a real fuss. That is exactly what she has done. Tonight's event is planned to draw attention to this escalating problem, with ever-increasing numbers of children abducted as ever more people travel to distant lands and meet and marry foreigners. \"It is a human rights issue,\" says Meyer. It is about the rights of children.</p> <p>The party is also intended to mark the inauguration of a website, set up in co-operation with the British police <a href=\"http://www.missingkids.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.missingkids.co.uk</a> to try to trace those sweet, smiling faces, those tragic missing children.</p> <p>The website has been in operation for some months - it was used, for example, this summer to try to find Sarah Payne before it was too late. Despite that ghastly outcome, there have been successes and the police are convinced this is a new tool that could be of real help. Both the police and the charity want to expand its use and alert more forces to its existence. It is intended to operate internationally and includes remarkable technical facilities, using ageing techniques for children who have been missing for years, for example.</p> <p>Meyer knows where her missing children are. It doesn't make the pain any easier. Alexander and Constantin are with her ex-husband who has used the courts in Germany in a protracted legal wrangle which has denied her even access to them. Meyer says that according to the terms they agreed on separation, she sent the children on holiday to their father in the summer of 1994. He didn't send them back. Although ordered to do so by the high court in London, under the terms of the Hague Convention which governs this matter, the father appealed to the German courts. The case is still before them.</p> <p>One of the purposes of the campaign is to draw attention to the working of the Hague Convention. Catherine can reel off the statistics of those countries which observe the requirements and the \"return\" rate of abducted children. The UK, for example, returns more than 90% of children abducted here; Germany returns 38%. There is a particular problem between the US and Germany and Meyer has also helped set up another organisation in Washington to co-ordinate parents involved in tug-of-love disputes between the two countries. She has written two books about missing children and has become an expert in international law. She is helping to organise an international conference on the Hague Convention.</p> <p>Her energy and commitment are remorseless. In the three years she has lived in Washington she has addressed committees of both the House of Representatives and the Senate and, on her own behalf, pulled every string she can.</p> <p>It still hasn't worked. Meyer has seen her children for less than 24 hours in all those long years and she has never seen them on her own terms, only in their father's house or at the lawyers'. And they have rejected her when she has seen them. She is matter-of-fact about this. She understands about parent alienation. She knows they have been told things that are not true. It doesn't make it any easier for her.</p> <p>\"They have said: 'We don't want to see you'. 'You have forced the press to lie.' 'You have written a book full of lies'. 'You could have come to see us any time - but you didn't.' They have been told I abandoned them.\"</p> <p>She remembers her children as they were when she lost them. They were aged seven and nine, still little boys who might cry when they fell over and scraped their knees. It is more than six years now since her children ran for comfort in her arms.</p> <p>The pain is unimaginable and only those who have suffered it can really understand. They are \"parent victims\" and they can relate immediately to each other. When I was with Meyer this week she met another mother, Chris O'Sullivan from Cork, whose four-year-old daughter, Deirdre, disappeared with her father last December. There was an immediate empathy between the two women as they met for the first time. \"If anyone had told me at the time Deirdre went that 10 months later it would be as if she had disappeared off the face of the earth, I don't think that I could have gone on living,\" O'Sullivan says.</p> <p>Meyer understood. \"Human beings adapt,\" she says. \"In a way it is easier that my children are still seven and nine for me because otherwise I would be further away from them.

      "bodyText": "The former Russian president Boris Yeltsin has promised that the publication next week of the final volume of his memoirs will shed light on the backroom manoeuvring at the Kremlin which propelled the then obscure Vladimir Putin to power last year. A Presidential Marathon covers Mr Yeltsin's final years in power, from the troubled presidential election campaign of 1996 to his unexpected resignation on the eve of the new millennium. Political analysts are waiting to see how he accounts for the crises which coloured this period: the unsatisfactory end to the first Chechen war, his frequent illnesses, the flawed privatisation process, the corruption investigations into his family and associates, and the thinking behind his decision to appoint five new prime ministers in the space of just 17 months. In one of his few interviews since leaving the Kremlin, Mr Yeltsin acknowledged yesterday the scale of his troubles during this time, saying the book analysed \"the years which cost me so much blood, perhaps the most difficult years of my political career\". But Mr Yeltsin stopped short of guaranteeing book buyers a gripping read, adding unwisely: \"I think that expos\u00e9s and sensations are not exactly my style.\" Translations of the book are to be published in western countries - including Britain - later this month, and the ex-president stands to boost his already substantial retirement allowance if it sells well. But a taster chapter published yesterday in the weekly paper Argumenty i Fakty casts doubt on quite how informative the memoirs will be - indicating rather that Mr Yeltsin is using this book, as he did the last volume, primarily as a forum for self-justification. Describing the days before his announcement on December 31 that he was handing power to Mr Putin, Mr Yeltsin details the reactions of his family to the news and the practical arrangements. But he fails to explain the fundamental question: why he thought it was necessary to abandon his post so hurriedly. The first person to hear Mr Yeltsin's decision to hand over power was Mr Putin, whose instant reaction was uncertainty that he was up to the responsibility. \"I do not think I am ready for this decision,\" Mr Yeltsin recalls him saying. \"It is a grave destiny.\" The ex-president, who prefers to be referred to as the first president, adds: \"This was not weakness. You couldn't call Putin weak - this was the doubt of a strong man.\" Since his resignation Mr Yeltsin has appeared in public only very occasionally, looking unhealthy and bloated. During this time, he claims to have kept a tape recorder with him at all times, dictating thoughts which fed into the work. But, like the two earlier volumes, the book was written with much assistance from a Kremlin speechwriter, Valentin Yumashev, a central figure in the Yeltsin entourage. Earlier this year another -decidedly more thrilling - account of Mr Yeltsin's last days in power was published in a Moscow newspaper, trailed as an exclusive extract from the forthcoming memoirs. A long passage including a description of how Mr Yeltsin was entranced by Mr Putin's abilities during a boar-hunting trip outside Moscow -\"He held his rifle firmly, as one holds in one's arms a woman one loves\" - was reprinted in the French newspaper Le Monde, which had failed to spot that the original piece was published on April 1.",

What can you do to save a child already sentenced to death by her own genetic inheritance? Not long ago, the grieving parents would just have had to watch her die and know that any other child born to them might easily face the same fate. But for this child there was another option. She could be saved by a transplant, which was most likely to be successful if it came from a sibling. But is it ever ethical to use one child to save another, and more especially to create one child to help another? </p> <p>In the Nash case, the parents wanted another child, a healthy child, one without Fanconi anaemia. Disregard ing Molly's plight, they had several options: they could conceive the old-fashioned way and hope the baby was not affected (despite the 25% chance that it would be); they could conceive naturally and have an abortion if ante-natal tests showed the child was affected; or they could opt for a new technique. Pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) involves creating an embryo by in vitro fertilisation, removing one cell and testing it, and then proceeding to use only unaffected embryos. So far so good. Surely no one could wish this couple with one affected child to risk another if the means exist to prevent it without the trauma of an abortion. </p> <p>The next step of choosing, from the unaffected embryos, one that was compatible with their afflicted daughter, which could help her, is not a huge or necessarily an undesirable step. It saves a life, relieves suffering and is not likely to make baby Adam less loved and appreciated than he would have been had he been randomly, naturally conceived. So, in this particular case, it would be quite difficult to condemn the parents for their choices or the doctors for using their best scientific and medical skills to do what the parents wanted. </p> <p>The question remains as to whether this sets humanity on a slippery slope to the creation of \"designer\" babies, genetically manipulated at the parents' whim to be taller, blonder, cleverer or more athletic than their peers. PGD is not an easy technique for doctor or patient. It is certainly not something you would undertake lightly, or for trivial reasons. Any form of IVF is a difficult business. It involves strong drugs and much disruption. It is intrusive, expensive and in Britain has a success rate, according to the latest figures from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), of 16.7%. You need a good, compelling reason such as infertility to undergo all that. </p> <p> PGD, however, is not a treatment for infertility but for genetic disorders and one might therefore expect it to be rather more successful. Yet it has a take-home-baby rate of closer to 10%. Lisa Nash had four successive attempts before she conceived Adam. Is anyone going to go through all that for possible added intelligence - even if it were possible to isolate the gene responsible? </p> <p>In this country, just five clinics are licensed to do PGD and each must apply to the HFEA for authorisation to carry out each new test. We basically allow PGD only for cases where there is a serious medical condition. So far, no one has asked us about a situation like that of the Nash family. But there are always hard cases and difficult decisions. The HFEA has been discussing PGD for some years and last November held a public consultation on the subject. That ended in March and the results have gone to the new Human Genetic Commis sion; we should have some conclusions by the beginning of next year. Among the issues are which sort of conditions PGD should be used for, whether it should always relate to a family history or could and should be used for the screening of some other genetic conditions, such as Downs Syndrome. </p> <p>One of the other big ethical issues arises in the use of PGD for sex selection. This may be for medical reasons, for instance where a male child would have haemophilia, but there are those, like the recently publicised case of the Mastersons in Scotland, where the parents want a child of a specific sex for social reasons, in this case to replace a daughter who has died. The HFEA's ethics committee has discussed sex selection (not necessarily by PGD) and are mostly against it for social reasons. But this specific case, where parents want to replace their only daughter, has not been turned down by the HFEA as a whole. We agreed that the matter could be considered by a licence committee if a licensed centre, which was willing to do the procedure, applied. </p> <p>We all want the welfare of the child born by any of the techniques we license to be paramount. We want each baby to be an individual and treated as such. It is important to those who regulate IVF in Britain that embryos are not created lightly or abused and destroyed wantonly and that, at every stage, the importance of individual human life is acknowledged. </p> <p>\u0095 Sara Nathan is a member of the ethics committee of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",

Industry sources said the brand, which is also behind People of Today - a rival to Who's Who - could fetch up to \u00a310m. Sterling insisted Debrett's was profitable but did not fit with its focus on specialist trade publications. \"The directors of Sterling believe that the Debrett's brand would be capable of significant further development and application if brought together with the right customer-facing partner,\" it said in an announcement to the stock market. Shares in Sterling, which publishes 100 business-to-business annual reviews, had slipped 1.5p to 150p as the markets closed last night. Analysts said that it was a sensible move as Debrett's was unlikely to feature strongly in the company's future. \"This is just good housekeeping,\" said Malcolm Morgan of Williams de Broe. \"It's not going to bring them a huge amount of cash and doesn't recognise a change of strategic direction.\" Sterling has appointed its financial adviser, Hawkpoint Partners, to carry out the strategic review of Debrett's. A sale or possibly a joint venture are understood to be the favoured options although a deal is not expected to be finalised for a couple of months. According to observers, online operators are expected to be among the bidders. Almost 150 editions of Debrett's Peerage and Baronetage have been published since it was first launched in 1769, during the reign of King George III. Recent additions to People of Today, which has 32,000 entries, include England soccer manager Kevin Keegan and Tony Ball, chief executive of BSkyB. Debrett's is also behind a range of books, including guides on etiquette and outrageous party games.",

      "bodyText": "A damaging split has developed inside the shadow cabinet between supporters of William Hague and Michael Portillo over the handling of what should have been the Tories top vote winning policy - to cut fuel duty by 3p a litre. The row which has echoes of the disputes, which have bedevilled Labour between the Brownites and the Blairites, exploded at an shadow cabinet \"awayday\" at a hotel near Ayles- bury at the end of last month. Both Hague and Portillo supporters confirm that there was \"a row\" between Mr Portillo and at least four members of the shadow cabinet over his failure until the next day to produce a plan to cut fuel duty while the nation had nearly been brought to a halt by protesters. During one exchange Archie Norman, the shadow environment secretary, is said to have told him: \"You are leaving us fighting in the trenches without giving us any guns.\" Mr Hague's supporters are furious that the leader did not act earlier to take over the handling of the policy, and see this as the first sign that Michael Portillo is seeking to carve out his own agenda. According to them, Mr Hague and almost half the shadow cabinet wanted to announce a pledge to cut petrol duty in early September, well before the protest began. They say the cut, which would have been higher at 5p per litre, was vetoed by Mr Portillo. When the shadow cabinet next met on September 20, after the fuel protest and evidence that the Labour poll lead was collapsing, Mr Portillo came under fire from at least four shadow cabinet ministers - Archie Norman, Andrew Lansley, Bernard Jenkin, and Liam Fox. They accused him of dragging his feet. Mr Portillo is said to have announced a u-turn, promising a 3p cut a litre in line with the Tories' opposition to the last rate rise in the Budget. But according to shadow cabinet sources Mr Portillo decided he would announce it himself - and made it clear to William Hague that he did not want any leaking of the figure in advance when journalists were briefed the next day. According to sources he also refused to allow two of the strongest critics who were furious about this, Mr Jenkin, the transport spokesman, and Mr Norman, to take part in the press conference announcing the price cut. Instead he insisted on doing it alone after a short introduction from the leader. One source said: \"It shows Michael's poor judgment and William Hague is letting him get away with it. If we had proceeded with the original plan the Tories could not have been accused on jumping on any populist bandwagon - we would have had protesters saying that they wanted at least what the Tories were already demanding.\" One of Mr Portillo's critics, Mr Lansley, tried to publicly redress the balance by pointing out at a conference fringe meeting that the Tories had been committed to reversing Labour's 3p tax rise since the Budget. Some senior Tories are also critical of Mr Portillo holding a \u00a310,000 consultancy with an US oil and chemical giant, Kerr McGee, which has extensive North Sea oil interests, while holding the shadow chancellor's job. One senior backbencher pointed out that he could not have announced the tax cut in parliament, as holding that job breached the advocacy rules.

(We have already reached many important agreements - in Camp David territorial partition, marking of borders, the future of the settlements, defence arrangements and even an independent Palestinian state).

Like A-levels, only infinitely superior, helping students \"become critical and compassionate thinkers, lifelong learners and informed participants in local and world affairs, conscious of the shared humanity that binds all people together.\" It sounds a bit foreign to me. That's just the sort of narrowminded attitude I'd expect from somebody who dropped French and European history at 16. Extraordinary! How? By insisting that pupils take six subjects including maths, English, a second language, one of the humanities, and media studies with a special focus on the social functions of docusoaps. Really? Not the media studies part. That little invention was what people of higher learning call a jeu d'esprit . Anyway, a new survey shows that one in eight of Britain's leading public schools are considering introducing the exam. \"A substantial minority of schools are starting to look at the IB, and this must reflect increasing dissatisfaction and concern about the new curriculum,\" says Dr Philip Evans, who chairs the schools' universities committee. Maintaining the gold standard and all that. Indeed. The restructured A-level system, some independent-sector heads claim, doesn't stretch the brightest pupils enough. Whereas at Britain's leading public schools they're firm believers in stretching the brightest pupils. And lots of other painful things, too, if the rumours are true. So will the spread of the IB in the UK help improve the cultural and intellectual calibre of the woefully ignorant younger generations? Don't ask me complicated questions like that. I only got 17 As at A-level. An Oxford admissions tutor adds: \"I'm terribly sorry, Miss Spence, but A-levels just don't cut the mustard now we've got the Baccalaureate. Have you considered a degree in brewing studies at the University of Wessex? Or Harvard?\"",

The national police chief, General Suroyo Bimantoro, accused Eurico Guterres of refusing to hand over weapons and instructing hundreds of his men to take back guns they had surrendered to the police in the town of Atambua, near the border with East Timor. The move coincides with UN reports that the militias' grip on the approximately 130,000 East Timorese refugees in West Timor is starting to weaken in some camps and that hundreds of refugees have returned to their homeland in the last couple of weeks. Mr Guterres was picked up at a Jakarta hotel and questioned for more than seven hours at the police headquarters. His lawyer, Suhardi Sumomulyono, said the arrest was not legal because the officers had no warrant and the charges were extremely unclear. If convicted, his client faces six years imprisonment. A police senior superintendent, Saleh Saaf, said: \"Eurico Guterres was arrested after there was enough evidence for him to become a suspect in the destruction and burning of the UNHCR office in Atambua.\" He did not say if Mr Guterres was also suspected of the murder of the three employees of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. Gen Bimantoro said Mr Guterres's detention was not linked to his being named earlier this week as a suspect for atrocities committed in East Timor last year. \"The East Timor investigation is still on-going,\" he said. Since the UNHCR murders Indonesia has come under increasing international pressure to deal with the militias. All the international aid agencies have withdrawn from West Timor and are refusing to return until those responsible for the aid workers' deaths have been detained, the militias disarmed and disbanded and law and order restored, a spokesman for the UNHCR, Peter Kessler, said. He said Mr Guterres's arrest was \"a step forward\", but added: \"Right now we're only seeing baby steps [from the Indonesian authorities]. We have a long way to go before the refugees can be considered free and in a position to make up their own minds whether to return to East Timor.\" The United States, Britain and the World Bank have threatened to suspend aid to Jakarta if the problems in West Timor are not resolved in the next few months. Jakarta's attempts to disarm the militias, which want East Timor returned to Indonesian rule, have so far proved a relative failure. Only a few dozen rifles and several hundred homemade firearms have been recovered. Most of their weapons were given to them by the Indonesian military last year when they were trying to destabilise East Timor in the run-up to the self-determination referendum, which was won overwhelmingly by the independence side. It was after this vote that the militias rampaged through East Timor and drove more than 270,000 people into West Timor. Mr Kessler said that the increasing number returning in the past few weeks showed that the militias' grip was slackening in some areas. \"In some areas the militias have withdrawn and the refugees are starting to pack up,\" he said. \"In other areas they [the militias] are still taking roll calls every week and in some camps every day. They are forbidding movement, even to go shopping for food.\"",

Inside the halls at Bournemouth and Brighton, there's been a lot of passion. The glow of mutual pleasure at advancing a common project has, despite argumentative reality intruding on Labour's affairs, scarcely ever cooled. Talking to each other, leader and party share a presumption of belief. There is very little doubt or cynicism. The audience actually wants to believe what it is told.</p> <p>Outside, the experience of leaders is completely different, and seems to get more so with every passing year. Outside, almost nobody is listening, hearing or believing. Both anecdote and opinion polls tell politicians that they've never been less trusted. They struggle to get through. The latest signals from the BBC only confirm their plight. The context they must live with is one where both main television channels now plan to slot their main news bulletins at the identical near-bedtime hour, and Panorama, the BBC's prime contribution to public affairs journalism, is sunk into the graveyard.</p> <p>This deepening scorn for politicians and their work coincides with other developments - which may be no accident. The audience in the conference hall is supposed to be less important than the other one. It has, after all, fewer votes. The parties' efforts to reach it, soothe it and satisfy it get ever more sophisticated. They spend vast resources on advice about how to reach out. Every backdrop, every lighting colour-change, every floor-speaker is choreographed in the hope of maximising the nationwide audience. But this audience, if it's there at all, registers indifference or rejection.</p> <p>In much the same spirit are most convictions muted. That's what the Tories were instructed to do this year: minimise their extremism, soften their image. Yet still the deficit, between the conference and the country, continues, because the politicians don't know how to handle the real problem. The real problem is not disagreement so much as general disbelief.</p> <p>The Tories did quite well at softening themselves. They showed how easily words could do the trick. Pledge yourself to a long-dead label and lo!, you set the terms of the reporting and the images the headlines produce. One Nation is a phrase that did once mean something. Fifty years ago, when the Disraelian formula was reclaimed by progressive MPs trying to make their way in a class-bound Tory party, it denoted a challenge to the fustian reactionaries then in charge. Now its meaning has become degraded. Everyone is as much for One Nation as they are for motherhood. Purloined by the right, to proclaim the party's togetherness, the imagery of this soft idea was projected this week with considerable discipline.</p> <p>There were a few hardline gestures. Ann Widdecombe gave conference a lot of pleasure on druggies and asylum seekers. Grammar schools and assisted places are pledged to come back. No-one spoke of Europe with other than contemptuous aggression. But if One Nation means emphasising the collective good, we heard plenty of it. There's suddenly an inner-city policy that is the purest milk of Heseltine; an education policy where the leader pledges his preference for state schooling; a health policy with the NHS avowedly at the heart of it; and even a Widdecombe utterance urging that prison be regarded as a place of reform not merely punishment. Wheel on John Major to give his imprimatur to the new inclusiveness, and the re-branding of this party, as being in touch with the same world Tony Blair appeals to, seems to be well advanced.</p> <p>But who will believe it? Who believes anything they hear, these days? Consider the credibility of Michael Portillo, the acme of re-branding. Here's the man in charge of the policy where there really is an irreducible difference with the other side, and he's not prepared to come up front with it. Instead he gives us the performance of the perfect postmodern Conservative, a journey round his semi-repentant psyche, rather than an honest tour of the programmes he would cut in order to accommodate the taxes he wants to get rid of. Empathy not candour is the watchword. These people, now that they think they have an outside chance of winning the election, are as disingenuous as the Blairism they have spent so much of the week biliously condemning.</p> <p>They are, in other words, trapped in the system of disbelief. They are part of it. All oppositions need an audience that believes they can change the world, but the Tories have yet to find it: not so much because most people disagree with them as because the party has caught the modern disease - being more interested in branding than in substance. The electorate's cynicism gets more armour-plated every year, and stitched-together One Nationism will not penetrate it.</p> <p>This is partly a Tory failure. The nation of cynics is observant. It sees a party that has few policies worked out in coherent detail. Mr Hague's overnight promise to better anything Labour does for pensioners was a naked piece of opportunism. Pensioners have every reason to be wary. Likewise, the whole electorate can only regard the inner-city lunge in the same spirit as Hague's impetuous commitments to accelerate health spending and reduce fuel taxes. They look like pledges for the moment, proving that politicians can do anything with figures. The soft-soaping self-presentation at the conference only makes people wonder why they are being got at.</p> <p>For behind the Tory failure is this deeper crisis of democratic politics: the fact that, outside the political world, most people neither like nor trust nor even take much interest in what politicians do. Francis Maude, in a speech to the Bow Group, expressed a timely anxiety about it. The eruption of the fuel protesters last month was, he thought, the latest symptom \"prompted by a sense that the politicians had in some really profound way broken the covenant of trust with the people\". Reaching for some kind of answer and a clean-sheet break with the past, Mr Maude suggested that \"relentless honesty\" would be made the first hallmark of a new Conservative government.</p> <p>I don't think Tony Blair, at his own party conference, did much to cure the disease of disbelief. He rallied the party, but in the country his poll ratings continue to lurch. Trust has departed his scene. So it will be, at a lower level, with the party that now pledges to be, above all, honest. \"Give me honesty, but not just yet\", it prefers to say, as it prevaricates about spending cuts and blatantly dissembles on how far it intends to disengage from the European Union. It successfully put on a new display this week, instructing the party faithful to moderate their instincts. This was supposed to broaden its base.

All these are legally registered first names which Honduran parents have given to their children in recent years, and which the national electoral tribunal feels are simply over the top. The tribunal, which oversees the country's public birth registry, announced earlier this week that it would ask the legislature to forbid parents from registering their children under \"extravagant or offensive\" names. The tribunal also plans to allow children to sue parents who gave them \"gross or insulting\" names. \"We are concerned by the custom among peasants of giving absurd names to their children,\" it declared in a statement. \"Without doubt, such names are a bother to the people who have to carry them through life.\" Particularly troublesome, it says, are naming practices in the largely indigenous Gracias a Dios in eastern Honduras. The province's name translates as \"Thank God\". \"It is common [there] for people to employ names usually used for automobile parts,\" the tribunal said. A young man there called Motor Martinez could meet the young girl - not a relative - called Bujia Martinez (Spark Plug Martinez). But if the proposed law wins approval, they will not be allowed to call their child Ignition. Nor would they be able to use the names of well-known personalities. According to the electoral rolls, at least one hapless Honduran bears the given name Bill Clinton, and another Ronald Reagan. AP",

He has embraced the role of modern Mexico's first president-elect from an opposition party - the conservative National Action party - with the energy and rock solid self-belief that kept him going through years of campaigning before his July election victory. \"You can already feel the transformation, there is a huge amount of positive energy, and the desire to get down to work and build a great nation,\" he said before he left Mexico. \"We want the Europeans to know that Mexico is now a true democracy, that the corruption and the insecurity is over, and that there is a government that is positive about investment.\" A Jesuit-educated former Coca-Cola executive and former rancher, Mr Fox defeated the Institutional Revolutionary party (PRI) after three years of sustained campaigning, chipping away at the widely held assumption that, however unpopular the 71-year regime might be, it could never lose the presidency. Now he is under pressure to shatter another two deeply held Mexican beliefs: that politicians never keep their promises and that power corrupts. \"I feel the enormous weight of peoples' expectations on my shoulders, but I am not going to run away, it doesn't frighten me,\" he said at his Mexico City headquarters, as if reciting a daily mantra. But governing successfully without a legislative majority, and attempting to transform a country of 100m people riddled with corruption, eaten away by poverty, and harbouring a myriad simmering conflicts will require more than determination. It will require all the political capital Mr Fox can muster, which is why his frenetic activity in the five months between being elected and taking office on December 1 owes as much to his need to keep the electoral feelgood factor going as it does to the nuts and bolts issues of the transition. Mr Fox's immediate focus is on eliminating high-level corruption and reducing violent crime. He admitted that reducing poverty would take longer, but insisted that peace in the troubled southern state of Chiapas could come as soon as the Zapatista rebel leader, Subcomandante Marcos, wakes up to the fact that a genuinely democratic government is now in power. Such upbeat talk of a post-PRI Mexican miracle has been aided by the outgoing president Ernesto Zedillo's determination to leave office gracefully.This has won him both praise as a statesman and howls of \"traitor\" from members of his party as it divides itself in a tug-of-war for its declining power base. \"The PRI leaves behind corruption, violence, poverty, backwardness, but on the other hand the economy is doing well and we have economic and political stability,\" Mr Fox said. He admitted that there would be resistance to the political clean-up and progressive modernisation he had promised, mainly from organised crime, the drug cartels and the most corrupt elements in the PRI, who see their interests affected, but he insisted that he would \"do battle\" against them. There are creeping signs that the honeymoon is already losing its shine. The revelation that senior advisers are already being paid salaries equivalent to government ministers lies uneasily with Mr Fox's promises of an upright political morality. There are also rumours that the transition team is riddled with backbiting and that there is a delicate relationship between the press and Mr Fox's spokeswoman, Martha Sahagun, in part sparked by speculation that they are about to get married. \"Now he is beginning to have to face the real Mexico, and the real Mexico is full of contradictions, even within his own supporters,\" the political analyst Alfonso Zarate said.",

The post of UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the head of an agency which works with 22m refugees throughout the world, is due to be filled by the end of the month. The UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, was in Geneva this week for discussions with the UNHCR executive about the position. But the International Council of Voluntary Organisations (ICVO), which represents most of the non-governmental aid organisations, is critical of the secrecy. Frances Stevenson, head of programmes for M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res, a member of the ICVO, said yesterday: \"There is no transparency at all. It is not clear who is being considered. She said: \"Like any democracy, we should know who the candidates are and there should be a public arena to allow debate rather than have it done behind closed doors.\" The ICVO, in an attempt to open up the process, wrote to various people mentioned as candidates, asking them to provide \"manifestos\". The results, published in the latest issue of its magazine Talk Back, are mixed. Some candidates refused to answer and others gave only sketchy details. Mr Annan declined at a press conference on Monday to name the candidates he was considering. \"This is not a public election. We have organised a long search.

African countries have put forward Maxime-Leopold Zollner de Medeiros of Benin, a former UNHCR official. Other candidates include Sergio Vieira de Mello, the UN's representative in East Timor and highly regarded as a former assistant high commissioner; the current assistant high commissioner Soren Jessen-Petersen; and Jan Pronk, a Dutch minister. The incumbent, Sadako Ogata, of Japan, is retiring. Mr Annan will make the appointment, which then has to be approved by the UN. This is normally a formality.

      "body": "<p>DNA fingerprinting, a technique routinely used to convict murderers and rapists, is being pioneered in Florida as a way of catching poachers hunting endangered wildlife. </p> <p>The technique has been developed by Ginger Clark, a senior lab technician at the University of Florida. \"I tend to get bored easily,\" she says. \"I was friends with a few people at the Fish and Wildlife Commission. About three years ago they wanted a test to be able to tell white tailed deer meat from other kinds of deer because they wanted to make hunting white tailed deer illegal. So that's what got me started. I worked out a test. Then I worked out one to tell what sex the deer was and it all snowballed from there.\" </p> <p>In Florida it is illegal to hunt white tailed deer for all but a short season; females can be hunted for only two days a year. Unscrupulous poachers are known to hunt both sexes of this rare deer and pass the meat off as another sort of venison. Clark's test can identify the species of deer, the sex, even what territory the animal is from, and on occasions, a particular individual. The test is based on identifying DNA from within the animal's mitochondria, small organs found in every cell which are inherited maternally. A hair, a few drops of blood or a scrap of flesh are usually enough to extract the relevant genetic material. </p> <p>\"The test is used in only a small proportion of cases,\" says Captain John Moran, investigation supervisor at the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission. He explains that poachers often confess if caught red-handed. \"Occasionally individuals are not going to be helpful and then we gather forensic evidence.\" </p> <p>He is currently prosecuting an individual who was very clearly unhelpful. An officer found a freshly killed doe in a field and waited to see if the poacher would return. But a fire broke out nearby and he was asked to help. When he returned early the next morning, the deer had been removed. </p> <p>\"The suspect lived about a mile or so away,\" says Moran, \"We went round to his house and found him asleep on the kitchen table next to a pile of entrails. He had blood and meat all over his trousers, but the rest of the animal was nowhere to be seen. He said it was from a deer he'd killed a few days ago.\" </p> <p>The officers took samples from the entrails, blood and hair on the table, as well as hair and blood left in the field where the deer had been killed. The results of the DNA test proved the deer samples were from the same animal. The poacher is likely to be convicted and to face a fine of up to $1,000 and a year in jail. </p> <p>Clark's test is also being used by the Fish and Wildlife Commission to investigate crimes against other endangered animals such as black bears and sea turtles which it is illegal to kill, and wild turkey and alligators which can be hunted but for a very short hunting season. </p> <p>Every year Florida holds a lottery, the lucky winners get to shoot 'gators. Because the lab at Florida University has been studying sea turtles for years and taking blood samples from the mothers as they return to their natal beaches, Clark can match up the DNA from poached animals very precisely to determine the exact beach from which the poachers stole them - even if the turtles have already been cooked. Ironically, the poachers are aided by wildlife conservation since conservation officials watch where the mother turtles lay their eggs, and put a flag above the nests. </p> <p>The idea is to warn people where the nests are as it is illegal to disturb or harass a turtle. However, the poachers use the flags as a way of telling where the eggs are. On the black market turtle eggs sell for a dollar and a quarter raw and a dollar and a half cooked. They have great appeal to certain clientele though Clark cannot understand why. \"They're nasty raw and still slimey on the inside when they're cooked,\" she says, \"The thought of eating them makes my skin crawl.\" </p> <p>Jim Ray, a local farmer, has started using Clark's technique, not only to guard against poachers, but also as a way of helping the hunting fraternity.

      "bodyText": "DNA fingerprinting, a technique routinely used to convict murderers and rapists, is being pioneered in Florida as a way of catching poachers hunting endangered wildlife. The technique has been developed by Ginger Clark, a senior lab technician at the University of Florida. \"I tend to get bored easily,\" she says. \"I was friends with a few people at the Fish and Wildlife Commission. About three years ago they wanted a test to be able to tell white tailed deer meat from other kinds of deer because they wanted to make hunting white tailed deer illegal. So that's what got me started. I worked out a test. Then I worked out one to tell what sex the deer was and it all snowballed from there.\" In Florida it is illegal to hunt white tailed deer for all but a short season; females can be hunted for only two days a year. Unscrupulous poachers are known to hunt both sexes of this rare deer and pass the meat off as another sort of venison. Clark's test can identify the species of deer, the sex, even what territory the animal is from, and on occasions, a particular individual. The test is based on identifying DNA from within the animal's mitochondria, small organs found in every cell which are inherited maternally. A hair, a few drops of blood or a scrap of flesh are usually enough to extract the relevant genetic material. \"The test is used in only a small proportion of cases,\" says Captain John Moran, investigation supervisor at the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission. He explains that poachers often confess if caught red-handed. \"Occasionally individuals are not going to be helpful and then we gather forensic evidence.\" He is currently prosecuting an individual who was very clearly unhelpful. An officer found a freshly killed doe in a field and waited to see if the poacher would return. But a fire broke out nearby and he was asked to help. When he returned early the next morning, the deer had been removed. \"The suspect lived about a mile or so away,\" says Moran, \"We went round to his house and found him asleep on the kitchen table next to a pile of entrails. He had blood and meat all over his trousers, but the rest of the animal was nowhere to be seen. He said it was from a deer he'd killed a few days ago.\" The officers took samples from the entrails, blood and hair on the table, as well as hair and blood left in the field where the deer had been killed. The results of the DNA test proved the deer samples were from the same animal. The poacher is likely to be convicted and to face a fine of up to $1,000 and a year in jail. Clark's test is also being used by the Fish and Wildlife Commission to investigate crimes against other endangered animals such as black bears and sea turtles which it is illegal to kill, and wild turkey and alligators which can be hunted but for a very short hunting season. Every year Florida holds a lottery, the lucky winners get to shoot 'gators. Because the lab at Florida University has been studying sea turtles for years and taking blood samples from the mothers as they return to their natal beaches, Clark can match up the DNA from poached animals very precisely to determine the exact beach from which the poachers stole them - even if the turtles have already been cooked. Ironically, the poachers are aided by wildlife conservation since conservation officials watch where the mother turtles lay their eggs, and put a flag above the nests. The idea is to warn people where the nests are as it is illegal to disturb or harass a turtle. However, the poachers use the flags as a way of telling where the eggs are. On the black market turtle eggs sell for a dollar and a quarter raw and a dollar and a half cooked. They have great appeal to certain clientele though Clark cannot understand why. \"They're nasty raw and still slimey on the inside when they're cooked,\" she says, \"The thought of eating them makes my skin crawl.\" Jim Ray, a local farmer, has started using Clark's technique, not only to guard against poachers, but also as a way of helping the hunting fraternity. He breeds white tailed deer specifically for shooting parties. By building up a profile of all 300 of his deer, he can determine which deer to breed from to ensure he gets the biggest \"racks\"; allowing hunters to kill deer with large antlers is more lucrative. If any of the deer are stolen for meat, breeding, or by \"weirdoes\" who will hang their stuffed heads up as trophies as if they'd shot the deer themselves, the Fish and Wildlife Commission could tell if it was one of Ray's deer. \"We really want to set a standard for the entire deer farming industry,\" says Ray. The key difference between DNA testing for poaching and for murder, is that it is the victim, rather than the villain, whose genetic profile is investigated. While the technique is undoubtedly useful, fingerprinting the perpetrator may one day also be an option. As it is, the tests do not always work in the law enforcement officers' favour. Clark describes how she was once given a blood sample which the Fish and Wildlife Commission was convinced came from a black bear. \"It was actually from a racoon. These guys from Fish and Wildlife are rarely wrong - he probably was poaching black bear, but they just didn't catch him in the act that time.\"",

But better do it soon, because there's a monster devouring the internet, and communal surfing could soon be just another adjunct of ICQ (\"I Seek You\"). </p> <p>Although it is still struggling to make an impression, the group surfing idea is far from new. It goes back at least as far as January 1995, when <a href=\"mailto:marj@ubique.co.il\">Marjorie Schejter</a> posted one of the most exciting messages to hit the WWW-talk mailing list. </p> <p>She was announcing a test version of Ubique's Virtual Places software, an \"extension to the web\", and the Sesame Navigator browser. \"People who use Sesame will be able to meet each other at your web pages, interact in real-time using text chat and audio, and conduct guided tours of your site and of other Virtual Places sites,\" she wrote. And it sounded like an Open Sesame for the web. </p> <p>This wasn't a mass market program - Virtual Places was available only for expensive Unix workstations - but it was surely just a matter of time before someone came along with something that ran on Windows PCs and Macs, and used a central server to synchronise surfers, instead of asking webmasters to run a \"virtual reality\" application. </p> <p>But while many companies have tried, none seems to have been much of a success. Gooey has come closest, but even that has struggled to reach critical mass. And that's the problem with all the systems that have started from scratch. You can visit half a dozen of your favourite websites with CrowdBurst, Odigo, TogetherWeb, TourBar or whatever, and sometimes not find anyone there at all. </p> <p>When you do find someone else at a website, either they turn out to be Brazilian (and claim not to speak English) or an Israeli (and claim not to work for a software developer) or else your message requesting a chat times out and you don't make contact at all. Well, that's what happened to me: an evening trying different systems for this article netted just one brief chat. </p> <p>It isn't that group surfing programs are hard to use: most get you up and running within 10-15 minutes. Typically you go to the home website and download a browser plug-in that identifies you to the system. It's best to save the file to a common directory, such as C:\\Dowloads on a PC, and run it from there, thinking carefully about the implications of the various questions you may be asked. As well as a nickname and an email address, details may include your gender, age, marital status, languages spoken, job, hobbies and interests, and even your star sign. Most of these will be made available to other users who may look you up before deciding whether to accept or reject an offer to chat. </p> <p>Once installed, the plug-in will add a side-bar or an extension to the bottom of your browser or, like Odigo, run pop-up consoles that help you find other users and send them messages, much like any instant messaging software. With \"community surfing\" add-ons, the tour guide or group leader can take other users to different websites, or pass control to another user. </p> <p>There's no doubt that these systems could be very useful in, for example, customer service applications, education and training. And they could provide newbies with conducted tours that introduce them to the best of the web, perhaps as pre-packaged sets of web addresses. But there is considerable doubt about whether communal surfing will ever become a mass market, or if it does, that the companies providing these applications will become rich and famous. </p> <p>The problem is that their initial premise is wrong. For huge numbers of people, surfing is not a solitary business. While online, they are also using a text-chat or instant messaging service, and the market for internet-based chat has already been taken. It is dominated by ICQ, which is owned by America Online, and by America Online's own Instant Message (IM) feature. </p> <p>ICQ already has more than 73 million users, and AOL takes the total to 138 million: a large proportion of the web. Even Microsoft, which can distribute its IM software with Windows, has only about 20 million users. </p> <p>And if you look at ICQ, it has not only been growing at a prodigious rate, it has been adding new features and new services just as quickly. There is now almost nothing you cannot do with ICQ. You can send instant messages, exchange files, keep notes, send email, send SMS messages to GSM mobile phones, create your own web page, send greetings cards ... and with ICQ Surf, \"surf along with other ICQ Surf users, find people who share your interests and chat with them on the same web page!\" </p> <p>With the new ICQPhone, you can even use internet-telephone technology to talk-and-surf, using your voice as well as, or instead of, typing in text. This is the nascent market that Firetalk and Cahoots probably thought they had to themselves. </p> <p> All this means that ICQ's software has become something of a monster: the basic file is now a 5 megabyte download, and there are 13 optional plug-ins. However, there's rarely a shortage of people to chat to. The problem with ICQ is keeping people away. </p> <p>And whereas most online chat and communal surfing programs are limited to one or two operating systems, sometimes only Windows, ICQ supports most clients to some degree, including Palm and Windows CE handhelds. </p> <p>AOL probably understood the power of instant messaging before the rest of us. It bought Ubique, the pioneer, in September 1995, when the idea was still permeating through the web, then sold it again, in May 1998, to IBM's Lotus Software division. Just a month later, AOL took over Mirabilis, the developer of ICQ, swapping a loser for a winner. It was a smart move, and one that will be hard for any start-up to overcome. </p> <p>Still, one curious point about the whole online chat/group surfing field is how much it owes to Israeli companies.

      "body": "<p>Think of someone you know who has never used the net, not even for email: your mother perhaps. If a government survey released this week is to be believed, the net-disenfranchised constitute 55% of adults - or almost 25 million people on the wrong side of the digital divide. </p> <p>Now put yourself in the position of the web missionary: the poor idiot who, after dinner and a bottle of wine, agrees to show your never-user around. How do you do it? </p> <p>Conscious of the power of first impressions, do you decide to show them one thing, which, to the eyes of a newcomer, will immediately release the potential, spirit and charm of the web? If so, what will it be? Email? A powerful search engine? A portal? A news service? None of the above? </p> <p>I believe there is one unmarketed, relatively unknown type of site that, executed right, will help to introduce the newcomer to the internet and keep them coming back. It is called a weblog. </p> <p>A weblog is, literally, a log of the web - a sort of frequently updated portal, where new entries go to the top and old ones drift to the bottom. It usually consists of the take of one editor - the weblogger or \"blogger\" - on the gems he or she has found online, either generally or on a theme. It sounds simple, and it is. Find one who shares your taste, and you have a surfing companion for life. </p> <p>The benefits to the new user are many. As with a conventional gateway site, you are soon offered links to other sites that cover your field of interest. But a good weblog will contain extra qualities: topicality, an individual voice, and a simple, often Spartan, design. These combine to create user-friendliness away from the glare of the big corporations - exactly what the sceptical surfer wants from the net, and doesn't get anywhere else. </p> <p>If your newcomer is into US media gossip, say, they need not go much further than <a href=\"http://www.MediaNews.org\" target=\"_new\">MediaNews.org</a>, edited by Chicago weblogger Jim Romenesko. It may be produced by a journalism institute, but it began as a labour of love. \"A weblog,\" he says, \"is certainly more intimate than a corporate site - and I think the best ones will increase that intimacy.\" </p> <p>With intimacy comes the freedom to explore a niche: <a href=\"http://www.chaparraltree.com/honeyguide/\" target=\"_new\">http://www.chaparraltree.com/honeyguide</a>. Honeyguide is a science weblog and Romenesko's other site, the <a href=\"http://www.obscurestore.com/\" target=\"_new\">Obscure Store</a>, a weblog of the weirder world of news. </p> <p>If your newcomer wanted something more general, they would find that close bond in any number of personal sites. <a href=\"http://www.haddock.org\" target=\"_new\">http://www.obscurestore.com</a>. The Haddock Directory is a weblog-cum-portal by Phil Gyford, an ex-Londoner now attending a course in \"studies of the future\" in Texas. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.kitschbitch.com/\" target=\"_new\">Kitschbitch</a>, by Katy Lindemann, a gap year student who did a stint at the Guardian, is more diary-based. And in <a href=\"http://www.rebeccablood.net/\" target=\"_new\">Rebecca's Pocket</a>, half news weblog, half liberal treatise on the world, San Francisco-based web developer Rebecca Blood chats to you as if you were in the next room. The tease \"what's in Rebecca's pocket?\" says it all. </p> <p>So why are weblogs so little known? Although they have been around since the very beginning of the net, the term was coined only in December 1997 (by Jorn Barger, editor of the <a href=\"http://www.robotwisdom.com\" target=\"_new\">Robot Wisdom weblog</a>), and there are still only tens of thousands across the world - nothing compared to the billion or so web pages in existence. Furthermore, most blogs are run by twentysomething Americans with at least an unhealthy interest in computers - a bias that is still reflected in the content of most sites. </p> <p>Only in the past year has software been developed which allows people to get blogging with the minimum of know-how: <a href=\"http://www.blogger.com \" target=\"_new\">Blogger</a>, the most celebrated of these, has just celebrated its first birthday and its 40,000th user. But although Pyra, the company that created it, is rightly praised for increasing the number of webloggers, Blogger has also spawned \"link-sluts\" - cliquey, second-generation webloggers who link to better blogs in the hope of a link in return. Despite Blogger's impressive figures, the number of quality weblogs hasn't quite reached critical mass. </p> <p>Webloggers can also be fiercely protective of their independence. Like the editors of zines before them, they exist in a world beyond the gaze of the marketing exec and the venture capitalist. \"Few webloggers are doing weblogs to attract millions of viewers,\" says Gyford, who edits Haddock. \"They don't have any marketing budget to help them do that, so they won't.\" </p> <p>Romenesko concurs, although his audience has grown quickly from just hundreds of visits a month to a quarter of a million, by little more than links and word of mouth. \"It's like fanzines - it's always going to be a semi-underground culture, and they have a limited interest,\" he says. \"Look at how much money is spent on marketing for these major sites.\" He does, though, sound a note of vindication: \"Fox News: their website, which has probably dozens of employees, they market on the Fox News channel. They don't have many more visitors than I have at my Medianews.org weblog, which has never spent a cent in promotion.\" </p> <p>Like Romenesko, most webloggers are sceptical of the way corporations exploit technology - and rightly proud of the way weblogs buck the trend. </p> <p>\"As we are increasingly bombarded with information from our computers, handhelds, in-store kiosks, and now our clothes,\" says Blood, in an apologia she has posted on Rebecca's Pocket, \"the need for reliable filters will become more pressing. We urgently need to cultivate forms of self-expression in order to counteract our self-defensive numbness and remember what it is to be human.\" </p> <p>Such filters are especially important to the newcomer; but the irony remains that it takes a corporation to reach newcomers on any scale. So, anathema as it is to many in the blogging community, why aren't more corporations doing weblogs of their own? </p> <p>A few newspapers have tried it out. <a href=\"http://www.sjmercury.com\" target=\"_new\">The San Jose Mercury News</a> runs a weblog, with high-profile IT columnist Dan Gillmor at the helm. The same newspaper produced one to catalogue the Y2K \"crisis\" in the days and hours after midnight 2000 - pity the journalist who had to cancel leave for that. Other papers with weblogs include <a href=\"http://www.startribune.com/\" target=\"_new\">The Minneapolis Star Tribune</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.theage.com.au/\" target=\"_new\">Melbourne Age</a> and, of course, the Guardian. Our blog of global journalism has been around since April. </p> <p> Also there is increased potential for niche media, such as the trade press, to create weblogs to suit their market. \"I can easily see a corporation producing a topic-oriented weblog,\" says Blood. \"In fact, I think it would be a very good way to position oneself as an expert in an area. I'm surprised more companies aren't doing this.\" </p> <p>But the value doesn't stop there. Internet service providers (ISPs) such as <a href=\"http://www.virgin.net\" target=\"_new\">Virgin Net</a> and <a href=\"http://www.Freeserve.com\" target=\"_new\">Freeserve</a> - home surfers' first view of the net - have long been putting original content on their websites, hoping customers will see them not only as a connection but as a gateway to the web. </p> <p> Many customers proceed to change their home page to a search engine or media brand they trust. But how much more trusting would newcomers become if these pages truly fulfilled the gateway function, and provided regularly updated links and commentary from the new surfer's point of view? </p> <p>The trouble, as Gyford points out, is the fear of losing 'stickiness'. \"Big corporations will want to attract millions of viewers,\" he says, \"so they'll produce very different products. People who make such decisions would have seen it as sending viewers off to other sites which is still, to them, a very bad idea.\" </p> <p>Of course, it doesn't take much nous to realise that links are what the web is all about; nor that 'stickiness' is achieved by offering users a service they trust. </p> <p>If you believe statistics published by Which? Online this summer, seven million Britons don't believe the net product is for them; and another half the population, who have used it at work, can't justify having it at home. </p> <p>Maybe it's time the ISPs, whose job it is to get people online, adopted more of the spirit of the net and said hello to the corporate weblog. </p> <p>\u0095 Chris Alden edits the Guardian Unlimited weblog <a href=\"http://guardianunlimited.co.uk/weblog\" target=\"_new\">http://guardianunlimited.co.uk/weblog </a>.</p>",

Internet service providers (ISPs) such as Virgin Net and Freeserve - home surfers' first view of the net - have long been putting original content on their websites, hoping customers will see them not only as a connection but as a gateway to the web. Many customers proceed to change their home page to a search engine or media brand they trust. But how much more trusting would newcomers become if these pages truly fulfilled the gateway function, and provided regularly updated links and commentary from the new surfer's point of view? The trouble, as Gyford points out, is the fear of losing 'stickiness'. \"Big corporations will want to attract millions of viewers,\" he says, \"so they'll produce very different products. People who make such decisions would have seen it as sending viewers off to other sites which is still, to them, a very bad idea.\" Of course, it doesn't take much nous to realise that links are what the web is all about; nor that 'stickiness' is achieved by offering users a service they trust. If you believe statistics published by Which? Online this summer, seven million Britons don't believe the net product is for them; and another half the population, who have used it at work, can't justify having it at home. Maybe it's time the ISPs, whose job it is to get people online, adopted more of the spirit of the net and said hello to the corporate weblog. \u0095 Chris Alden edits the Guardian Unlimited weblog http://guardianunlimited.co.uk/weblog .",

      "body": "<p>Reviewing someone's first novel, it is customary to be polite about it, to find things to praise in it. So let me say straight away that James Thackara's The Book Of Kings is printed on very nice paper, and the typeface is clear and readable. And, given that it's 773 pages long, the author has shown a commendable degree of application and spent a great deal of time on the project. </p> <p>That, as it turns out, is the literary-London story of the book; that he's been writing it for years and years. This, we were promised, was going to be the great novel of the European experience, covering continents in its magisterial stride. Now, at last, here it is, and we can judge for ourselves. </p> <p>And it's terrible. Startlingly badly written, with no apparent understanding of what drives people or how people relate or talk to each other, it is a book of gigantic, hopeless awfulness. You read it to a constant, internal muttering of \"Oh -God - Thackara - please, don't - no - oh, God, just listen to this rubbish\". It's so awful, it's not even funny. There is not one decent sentence in the book, nothing but falsity and a useless sincerity. It may be the very worst novel I have read. </p> <p>The scene is Paris in 1932. Thunder clouds are gathering over Europe, but what care our four gay students? They will go and drink and eat and be merry at Polidor's! Ah, Polidor's, where you can buy, er, fish from the jolly old patronne - \"' La-Bas, mes beaux gar\u00e7ons, mes anges ; sit down, eat a good dinner!' she shouted, with the discernment of old women for young men.\" Meanwhile things are getting grim in Germany. </p> <p>Soon the time will come for our four students to part. David Sunda, Johannes Godard, Duncan Penn and Justin Lothaire; each comes from a different part of the world. History will treat some of them roughly, of that you may be sure! And some will survive the coming catastrophe, and some, mes braves , will triumph over the savage wavelets of History. (Thackara's style, distressingly, is rather contagious.) And the result is the usual stuff, the tragedy of Germany, the tragedy of Europe, friends sundered by the movements of History, and a book as thick as your wrist. </p> <p>What sets Thackara apart is quite a simple fact. He can't write. After a while, the incredulous reader starts to play a game: to open the book at random and try and find a tolerable sentence. Save your effort - you will never win. Thackara is always ahead of you, with his uncanny knack for the not-quite-right word and the yer-what turn of phrase. \"You could not see his parents' intricate cultivation, nor that the ball was in the Palazzo Farnese, just after the war.\" \"Justin's friend was not in the courtyard, but the fountain was.\" \"The Hanoverian battery commander, Egbert, was as delighted as a music conductor to show off for his guests behind the embankment wall.\" These examples are taken entirely at random. It is all at least as bad as this, and some of it is worse to an unspeakable degree. </p> <p>Terrible as Thackara's prose is, it becomes quite unremarkable when set next to his idea of dialogue. \"David . . . what about kindness and children, what about right and wrong? Also love. What about love?\" \"Isn't the power and its refinement here?\" \"The struggle there, Eli, is for the soil of my fathers.\" Every single character talks in exactly the same idiotically macaronic way, and 500 pages into it, you are still trying to remember which humourless pundit is which.

      "bodyText": "Reviewing someone's first novel, it is customary to be polite about it, to find things to praise in it. So let me say straight away that James Thackara's The Book Of Kings is printed on very nice paper, and the typeface is clear and readable. And, given that it's 773 pages long, the author has shown a commendable degree of application and spent a great deal of time on the project. That, as it turns out, is the literary-London story of the book; that he's been writing it for years and years. This, we were promised, was going to be the great novel of the European experience, covering continents in its magisterial stride. Now, at last, here it is, and we can judge for ourselves. And it's terrible. Startlingly badly written, with no apparent understanding of what drives people or how people relate or talk to each other, it is a book of gigantic, hopeless awfulness. You read it to a constant, internal muttering of \"Oh -God - Thackara - please, don't - no - oh, God, just listen to this rubbish\". It's so awful, it's not even funny. There is not one decent sentence in the book, nothing but falsity and a useless sincerity. It may be the very worst novel I have read. The scene is Paris in 1932. Thunder clouds are gathering over Europe, but what care our four gay students? They will go and drink and eat and be merry at Polidor's! Ah, Polidor's, where you can buy, er, fish from the jolly old patronne - \"' La-Bas, mes beaux gar\u00e7ons, mes anges ; sit down, eat a good dinner!' she shouted, with the discernment of old women for young men.\" Meanwhile things are getting grim in Germany. Soon the time will come for our four students to part. David Sunda, Johannes Godard, Duncan Penn and Justin Lothaire; each comes from a different part of the world. History will treat some of them roughly, of that you may be sure! And some will survive the coming catastrophe, and some, mes braves , will triumph over the savage wavelets of History. (Thackara's style, distressingly, is rather contagious.) And the result is the usual stuff, the tragedy of Germany, the tragedy of Europe, friends sundered by the movements of History, and a book as thick as your wrist. What sets Thackara apart is quite a simple fact. He can't write. After a while, the incredulous reader starts to play a game: to open the book at random and try and find a tolerable sentence. Save your effort - you will never win. Thackara is always ahead of you, with his uncanny knack for the not-quite-right word and the yer-what turn of phrase. \"You could not see his parents' intricate cultivation, nor that the ball was in the Palazzo Farnese, just after the war.\" \"Justin's friend was not in the courtyard, but the fountain was.\" \"The Hanoverian battery commander, Egbert, was as delighted as a music conductor to show off for his guests behind the embankment wall.\" These examples are taken entirely at random. It is all at least as bad as this, and some of it is worse to an unspeakable degree. Terrible as Thackara's prose is, it becomes quite unremarkable when set next to his idea of dialogue. \"David . . . what about kindness and children, what about right and wrong? Also love. What about love?\" \"Isn't the power and its refinement here?\" \"The struggle there, Eli, is for the soil of my fathers.\" Every single character talks in exactly the same idiotically macaronic way, and 500 pages into it, you are still trying to remember which humourless pundit is which. The women sound like the men. The men sound like nothing on earth. And not one of them has a single thing to say other than how the Tragedy of History is progressing. The awful thing is that Thackara really wants to say something. He is utterly sincere, and will probably be admired by people who believe that sincerity, rather than art, is the basis of a great novel. He is probably a nice man. He obviously cares deeply about these great historical movements and has done a great deal of research - my God, he has researched and researched and researched.

      "body": "<p>Goliath beware. In the fertile lands of internet radio, David just found his slingshot. And, fittingly, it is called Aim. </p> <p>In the music industry, Goliath has brothers. There are five of them, the \"major\" record labels. Between them they control a mighty 74% of the music market. Time Warner, EMI, Universal, Sony and BMG all loom large while, by contrast, the remaining 26% - the independent record companies - number more than 400. </p> <p>As equally diverse as the \"indies\" are the number of new digital technologies springing up - internet radio, broadband television, mobile phone radio - offering new avenues for the labels' content. </p> <p>But there is a problem. The essence of British copyright law is thus: if a company profits from an artist's work by broadcasting, the artist and their label are due compensation. In terrestrial broadcasting, all is well. Several collecting bodies amass due royalties for the artists, labels, publishers and composers. </p> <p>But no one collects online fees. That means that, with blanket licences unavailable, the indies are in danger. If a broadcaster wants to license independent music, each tiny label is in a weak bargaining position. Worse still, if a broadcaster had to approach each of the 400 indies in turn, the logistical headache becomes a complete turn off. Labels do not get copyright fees, broadcasters cannot license content and emerging markets are left in stasis. </p> <p>Enter the Association of Independent Music (Aim). Rep resenting more than 95% of Britain's indies, Aim solves the two problems in one. It is a one-stop shop for broadcasters looking to license independent music and it wields the indie's market share the only way it is useful: as a whole. Even more importantly, while the majors deliberate, deny and dread the issue of new technologies like digital distribution and internet radio, Aim is taking the bull by the hard drive. </p> <p>In July, Aim launched its trial: labels allowed legal access to their digital back catalogues to broadcasters. The goal, in six months' time, is a licensing agreement for digital music, that everyone has agreed to and participated in forming. One-nil to the indies. </p> <p>Playing centre forward for Aim is the recently appointed Mo Darbyshire. </p> <p>An expert within the broadcast industry, Darbyshire is also the director of music services at Sky. It is her task to conduct this trial and then assemble a licensing scheme. </p> <p>\"Aim has two major advantages,\" she explains. \"One, having autonomy and two, being able to move very quickly with it. I would be very surprised if the majors were able to put a licensing scheme together as quickly as Aim will be able to.\" </p> <p>The task facing Aim, with its target of a digital licensing scheme, is not an easy one. It must establish, to the industry's satisfaction, a scale of remuneration over a vast variety of new media. </p> <p>Just what is the worth of a track played on internet radio? Over a mobile phone? To subscription broadband TV? There are hard decisions that must be taken, but at least the indies are tackling them. The majors, by contrast, are stuck like a rabbit in headlights. </p> <p>When the majors are not vainly trying to make the whole digital music phenomenon disappear, by suing companies such as Napster and My.MP3.com, they are reacting to the possibilities of digital music about as quickly as Blair to a fuel crisis. \"I understand their nervousness,\" adds Mo Darbyshire, \"but they need to get hold of it by the throat. The technology is here and it's not going away. I don't think that digital distribution is going to be quite the threat that everyone thinks.\" </p> <p>Just as radio did not destroy newspapers, or in turn television replace radio, every new medium forces a market repositioning, seldom elimination. </p> <p>The majors, however, have yet to decide whether digital distribution is incremental or substitutional to their business. Is it core, near core or incidental to what they do? </p> <p>The problem is, digital distribution blurs the boundaries between broadcasting and product. Aim's trial does not include downloads, the source of <a href=\"http://www.My.MP3.com\" target=\"_new\">My.MP3.com</a> and Napster's grief. </p> <p>That's a product the labels want to sell individually. But what is the difference between listening to a CD and having audio streamed to your hi-fi? </p> <p>The issue of internet radio, again, makes the major's very nervous. Online radio is an interactive experience and flips on its head the old model of radio as a passive listening experience. </p> <p>As Aim's legal adviser, Helen Smith explains: \"Internet radio means 20 different things to 10 different people.\" Aim's trial covers the use of continuous or live streaming, looped productions and archived or on-demand productions. The issue of advance play listing worries the majors no end, because why buy a track you could record? </p> <p>From a UK perspective, the majors' hands are, in many ways, tied by US parent companies. Andy Strickland, the editor of Dotmusic.com, Britain's biggest music website, explains: \"We say to the majors 'this situation is mad.' They reply, 'sorry but our business affairs are in California and this is their policy'. </p> <p>\"Nobody wants to make a decision or formalise a partnership and then have to be responsible. So everyone's having 'trials' and waiting for front runners to emerge.\" </p> <p>The reason for the major label paralysis that is stalling growth, however, dates back to a painful 1980's experience, the MTV fiasco. Caught out by the explosion in music videos, major labels lost the chance to profit from the content they'd produced. By some clever negotiating with individual labels, MTV by-passed the central licensing authorities. It was to prove the beginning of the end for blanket licenses. </p> <p> Even though MTV massively promoted major labels' products, those labels fear donating their content. But as Dotmusic's deputy editor, James Poletti explains: \"There isn't one single winner emerging from the internet in the same way MTV rose to stand alongside the majors. The competition is much more fierce and the start-up costs aren't anything like as high.\" </p> <p>The rise of MTV left the indie labels out in the cold. With websites like Dotmusic, a member or \"friend\" of Aim, considering the internet radio market, the Aim trial gives broadcasters legitimacy and the indies a head start. </p> <p>As Poletti explains: \"The independent labels have got a captive audience. If we wanted to launch an internet radio station today, the only way we could do it was if we used the labels affiliated with Aim. Our users would hear nothing by the majors.\" </p> <p>One company launching internet radio stations is Capital Radio. While the station currently simulcasts its conventional shows online, taking advantage of a licensing loophole, it has plans for three internet specific stations. </p> <p>Three niche channels, provisionally called Diva (for young professional women), Rage (hard dance and nu-metal) and Urban Grooves (soul and R'n'B), are designed to target specific markets. </p> <p>Online radio does not fit conventional broadcast models. The more listeners you have online, for example, the more it costs you for extra bandwidth and equipment to serve them. </p> <p>Furthermore, \"narrow casting\" as Capital refers to it, is tailor-made for niche music in niche markets. Gone are the days of playing the 10 top-selling singles four times a day. Stations can afford to cater to the vast numbers of people with more diverse interests in music. </p> <p>To \"extract value\" from listeners, Capital ensures the radio icon that sits on your desktop has advertising tailored to the particular niche demographic to which you belong, and the music tracks are played with audio ads running between them. And, next to a picture of the album artwork, there is a link which allows you to impulse-buy the album from which the music you are listening to is taken. </p> <p>Capital Interactive's head of programming and production, Tom Laidlaw, explains: \"Wouldn't it be great to be able to buy tracks on the radio without having to hum it to the sales assistant in HMV? That's what we're trying to offer: radio with a 'buy it' button. It's a holy grail.\" </p> <p>Again the boundaries are blurred. With Capital Radio the broadcaster and the retailer, they sit on both sides of the fence. Laid law denies any conflict of interest. \"As soon as a radio station compromises its output, it's finished,\" he says. </p> <p>Equally, with pack shots of CDs displayed as a track plays, isn't it a small step (in bandwidth terms) to show accompanying videos? Thus a radio broadcaster becomes a kind of e-MTV. </p> <p>Capital also has plans to target markets abroad in the future. Talks have begun with undisclosed companies with technology capable of tailoring adverts to individual countries. </p> <p>Welcome to the future of internet radio: personalisation. Stepping beyond niche broadcasting, where the content is shaped towards a demographic, here the content will be further narrowed to uniquely suit each listener. </p> <p>And while Capital is keen to stress this isn't a jukebox or CD substitute - all models that would compromise its relationship with the majors - it does mean unique content for each listener. </p> <p>Market research house Forrester sees the path to ubiquitous personalised internet radio happening in three stages. The next two years are still the PC era, with access remaining through your desktop computer. By 2004, the rise of broadband means we will see the dawn of a device era, with TV set top boxes and internet radios becoming more common. By 2005 and beyond, Forrester forecasts internet radios capable of being used anywhere, anytime, inside portable in-car radios and wireless MP3 players. They predict that 41% of the US population will tune in by that time. </p> <p>Certainly the development of internet car radios will boost usage, but the British area of growth is set to be mobile phones. </p> <p>Internet radio on your phone is already a reality. In August, Virgin Mobile launched the world's first MP3 phone which tunes into virgin.net's online radio broadcast. Users can also access its jukebox facility, listening to clips of 10 new tracks each week - and not just those acts who are signed to V2 records, either. If they like those tracks they can buy them directly using their mobile. </p> <p>Better is yet to come: while the Virgin MP3 phone now requires users to load digital audio files from home PCs, there will soon be phones with a permanent connection to the networks. </p> <p>By next spring, users will be able to download albums' worth of digital music from their personal collection, anywhere. Bored with the album you took to work on your phone, by lunch? You'll be able to replace it with a click of a button, over the air. </p> <p>And if your own collection is dull, with a permanent connection to the network, the multitude of internet radio stations will be just as near. </p> <p>Steven Day, a spokesman for Virgin Mobile, says: \"All of the other competitors in the UK mobile phone market have been talking about the things you can do with your phone for ages. None of them have ever done anything of note.\" </p> <p>You can be sure they are taking note now. </p> <p>All of which makes Aim's trial all the more important. Peter Quick, label manager for Aim member, Ninja Tune records, points out: \"We have to make sure that we don't end up with the same situation as America where there are no recording performance royalties. </p> <p>\"If you leave it for years without making a stand for copyright on internet radio, you'll make it increasingly likely that there won't be any.\" </p> <p>Ready, Aim? Fire. </p> <p><strong> Music definitions</strong> </p> <p> <strong> ATRAC</strong> </p> <p>Sony's audio compression system, used in MiniDisc players and the Sony Memory Stick Walkman.

      "bodyText": "Goliath beware. In the fertile lands of internet radio, David just found his slingshot. And, fittingly, it is called Aim. In the music industry, Goliath has brothers. There are five of them, the \"major\" record labels. Between them they control a mighty 74% of the music market. Time Warner, EMI, Universal, Sony and BMG all loom large while, by contrast, the remaining 26% - the independent record companies - number more than 400. As equally diverse as the \"indies\" are the number of new digital technologies springing up - internet radio, broadband television, mobile phone radio - offering new avenues for the labels' content. But there is a problem. The essence of British copyright law is thus: if a company profits from an artist's work by broadcasting, the artist and their label are due compensation. In terrestrial broadcasting, all is well. Several collecting bodies amass due royalties for the artists, labels, publishers and composers. But no one collects online fees. That means that, with blanket licences unavailable, the indies are in danger. If a broadcaster wants to license independent music, each tiny label is in a weak bargaining position. Worse still, if a broadcaster had to approach each of the 400 indies in turn, the logistical headache becomes a complete turn off. Labels do not get copyright fees, broadcasters cannot license content and emerging markets are left in stasis. Enter the Association of Independent Music (Aim). Rep resenting more than 95% of Britain's indies, Aim solves the two problems in one. It is a one-stop shop for broadcasters looking to license independent music and it wields the indie's market share the only way it is useful: as a whole. Even more importantly, while the majors deliberate, deny and dread the issue of new technologies like digital distribution and internet radio, Aim is taking the bull by the hard drive. In July, Aim launched its trial: labels allowed legal access to their digital back catalogues to broadcasters. The goal, in six months' time, is a licensing agreement for digital music, that everyone has agreed to and participated in forming. One-nil to the indies. Playing centre forward for Aim is the recently appointed Mo Darbyshire. An expert within the broadcast industry, Darbyshire is also the director of music services at Sky. It is her task to conduct this trial and then assemble a licensing scheme. \"Aim has two major advantages,\" she explains. \"One, having autonomy and two, being able to move very quickly with it. I would be very surprised if the majors were able to put a licensing scheme together as quickly as Aim will be able to.\" The task facing Aim, with its target of a digital licensing scheme, is not an easy one. It must establish, to the industry's satisfaction, a scale of remuneration over a vast variety of new media. Just what is the worth of a track played on internet radio? Over a mobile phone? To subscription broadband TV? There are hard decisions that must be taken, but at least the indies are tackling them. The majors, by contrast, are stuck like a rabbit in headlights. When the majors are not vainly trying to make the whole digital music phenomenon disappear, by suing companies such as Napster and My.MP3.com, they are reacting to the possibilities of digital music about as quickly as Blair to a fuel crisis. \"I understand their nervousness,\" adds Mo Darbyshire, \"but they need to get hold of it by the throat. The technology is here and it's not going away. I don't think that digital distribution is going to be quite the threat that everyone thinks.\" Just as radio did not destroy newspapers, or in turn television replace radio, every new medium forces a market repositioning, seldom elimination. The majors, however, have yet to decide whether digital distribution is incremental or substitutional to their business. Is it core, near core or incidental to what they do? The problem is, digital distribution blurs the boundaries between broadcasting and product. Aim's trial does not include downloads, the source of My.MP3.com and Napster's grief. That's a product the labels want to sell individually. But what is the difference between listening to a CD and having audio streamed to your hi-fi? The issue of internet radio, again, makes the major's very nervous. Online radio is an interactive experience and flips on its head the old model of radio as a passive listening experience. As Aim's legal adviser, Helen Smith explains: \"Internet radio means 20 different things to 10 different people.\" Aim's trial covers the use of continuous or live streaming, looped productions and archived or on-demand productions. The issue of advance play listing worries the majors no end, because why buy a track you could record? From a UK perspective, the majors' hands are, in many ways, tied by US parent companies. Andy Strickland, the editor of Dotmusic.com, Britain's biggest music website, explains: \"We say to the majors 'this situation is mad.' They reply, 'sorry but our business affairs are in California and this is their policy'. \"Nobody wants to make a decision or formalise a partnership and then have to be responsible. So everyone's having 'trials' and waiting for front runners to emerge.\" The reason for the major label paralysis that is stalling growth, however, dates back to a painful 1980's experience, the MTV fiasco. Caught out by the explosion in music videos, major labels lost the chance to profit from the content they'd produced. By some clever negotiating with individual labels, MTV by-passed the central licensing authorities. It was to prove the beginning of the end for blanket licenses. Even though MTV massively promoted major labels' products, those labels fear donating their content. But as Dotmusic's deputy editor, James Poletti explains: \"There isn't one single winner emerging from the internet in the same way MTV rose to stand alongside the majors. The competition is much more fierce and the start-up costs aren't anything like as high.\" The rise of MTV left the indie labels out in the cold. With websites like Dotmusic, a member or \"friend\" of Aim, considering the internet radio market, the Aim trial gives broadcasters legitimacy and the indies a head start. As Poletti explains: \"The independent labels have got a captive audience. If we wanted to launch an internet radio station today, the only way we could do it was if we used the labels affiliated with Aim. Our users would hear nothing by the majors.\" One company launching internet radio stations is Capital Radio. While the station currently simulcasts its conventional shows online, taking advantage of a licensing loophole, it has plans for three internet specific stations. Three niche channels, provisionally called Diva (for young professional women), Rage (hard dance and nu-metal) and Urban Grooves (soul and R'n'B), are designed to target specific markets. Online radio does not fit conventional broadcast models. The more listeners you have online, for example, the more it costs you for extra bandwidth and equipment to serve them. Furthermore, \"narrow casting\" as Capital refers to it, is tailor-made for niche music in niche markets. Gone are the days of playing the 10 top-selling singles four times a day. Stations can afford to cater to the vast numbers of people with more diverse interests in music. To \"extract value\" from listeners, Capital ensures the radio icon that sits on your desktop has advertising tailored to the particular niche demographic to which you belong, and the music tracks are played with audio ads running between them. And, next to a picture of the album artwork, there is a link which allows you to impulse-buy the album from which the music you are listening to is taken. Capital Interactive's head of programming and production, Tom Laidlaw, explains: \"Wouldn't it be great to be able to buy tracks on the radio without having to hum it to the sales assistant in HMV? That's what we're trying to offer: radio with a 'buy it' button. It's a holy grail.\" Again the boundaries are blurred. With Capital Radio the broadcaster and the retailer, they sit on both sides of the fence. Laid law denies any conflict of interest. \"As soon as a radio station compromises its output, it's finished,\" he says. Equally, with pack shots of CDs displayed as a track plays, isn't it a small step (in bandwidth terms) to show accompanying videos? Thus a radio broadcaster becomes a kind of e-MTV. Capital also has plans to target markets abroad in the future. Talks have begun with undisclosed companies with technology capable of tailoring adverts to individual countries. Welcome to the future of internet radio: personalisation. Stepping beyond niche broadcasting, where the content is shaped towards a demographic, here the content will be further narrowed to uniquely suit each listener. And while Capital is keen to stress this isn't a jukebox or CD substitute - all models that would compromise its relationship with the majors - it does mean unique content for each listener. Market research house Forrester sees the path to ubiquitous personalised internet radio happening in three stages. The next two years are still the PC era, with access remaining through your desktop computer. By 2004, the rise of broadband means we will see the dawn of a device era, with TV set top boxes and internet radios becoming more common. By 2005 and beyond, Forrester forecasts internet radios capable of being used anywhere, anytime, inside portable in-car radios and wireless MP3 players. They predict that 41% of the US population will tune in by that time. Certainly the development of internet car radios will boost usage, but the British area of growth is set to be mobile phones. Internet radio on your phone is already a reality. In August, Virgin Mobile launched the world's first MP3 phone which tunes into virgin.net's online radio broadcast. Users can also access its jukebox facility, listening to clips of 10 new tracks each week - and not just those acts who are signed to V2 records, either. If they like those tracks they can buy them directly using their mobile. Better is yet to come: while the Virgin MP3 phone now requires users to load digital audio files from home PCs, there will soon be phones with a permanent connection to the networks. By next spring, users will be able to download albums' worth of digital music from their personal collection, anywhere. Bored with the album you took to work on your phone, by lunch? You'll be able to replace it with a click of a button, over the air. And if your own collection is dull, with a permanent connection to the network, the multitude of internet radio stations will be just as near. Steven Day, a spokesman for Virgin Mobile, says: \"All of the other competitors in the UK mobile phone market have been talking about the things you can do with your phone for ages. None of them have ever done anything of note.\" You can be sure they are taking note now. All of which makes Aim's trial all the more important. Peter Quick, label manager for Aim member, Ninja Tune records, points out: \"We have to make sure that we don't end up with the same situation as America where there are no recording performance royalties. \"If you leave it for years without making a stand for copyright on internet radio, you'll make it increasingly likely that there won't be any.\" Ready, Aim? Fire. Music definitions ATRAC Sony's audio compression system, used in MiniDisc players and the Sony Memory Stick Walkman. SCMS (Serial Copy Management System) prevents digital copying. ATRAC is derived from Adaptive TRansform Acoustic Coding. MP3 Compression technology that can store music in small files for fast downloads, MP3 is the people's choice for exchanging digital music files, partly because it provides no copyright protection. The name is derived from MPEG (Motion Picture Experts Group) 1, Audio Layer 3. RealMedia Streaming sound and (later) video formats developed by Real Networks (formerly Progressive Networks). Real was first to bring sound to the web, with RealPlayer in 1995. It now dominates the market for streaming media with RelaAudio and RealVideo. WMA Windows Media Audio (or MS Audio 4.x): Microsoft's music format, launched in April 1999, for \"streaming\" and storing music files. Its compression system provides better quality than MP3 or the same quality with files about half the size. Windows Media Digital Rights Management (DRM) provides copyright protection.

      "body": "<p>I have a new toy and it is attracting quite a bit of attention. Workmates come over to my desk, pick up the gleaming new toy, \"ooh\" and \"aah\" as if it's November 5, and then ask how much the toy is going to cost when it comes out. My answer ensures the same response from everyone - they quickly put it down and walk off before they risk damaging it. </p> <p>And the cause of all this excitement? The next generation of MP3 player, Creative Labs' Dap Jukebox. Dap stands for digital audio player, a term which Creative Labs is keen to stress as the Jukebox is designed to do far more than simply play MP3 files. </p> <p>Yes, the estimated price of \u00a3349 might make you flinch, but the Jukebox makes every other player on the market look ready for the retirement home. </p> <p>And while it is roughly twice the price of other players on the market, it offers much more than twice the performance. The fact that it has been designed as a curvy, silver delight doesn't harm matters either. </p> <p>It is not the Dap Jukebox's looks that have got reviewers in a tizz, though. The Jukebox can pack up to 200 albums of MP3 files on to its 6GB of memory (the higher the quality of the encoding, the larger the file size - 200 albums is possible at a 96kbps bit-rate). </p> <p>Creative Labs has made the whole process of retrieving tracks off a CD on to the player as painless as possible, as long as you have an internet connection. </p> <p>As soon as a new CD is placed into your PC's CD drive, the program goes off to the CD DataBase on the internet, identifies the album, artist and even genre (this takes a few seconds), then begins the process of copying it on to the PC's hard drive and encoding each track into the chosen audio format. Each CD should take 15 minutes to copy. </p> <p>You can also plug speakers into the back of the Jukebox via its two stereo line-in sockets. </p> <p>The Jukebox also uses firmware software, meaning that its operating system can be upgraded to take account of new digital formats. This is highly significant, given that MP3 has only a limited shelf-life as the standard digital audio format. </p> <p>Microsoft is currently leading the pack of would-be successors with its Windows Media Audio (WMA) format, which offers better quality and smaller file sizes than MP3, as does Dolby's pioneering Audio Acoustic Coding (AAC) format. </p> <p>Creative Labs is promising that the Jukebox will be able to read MP3, WAV, AAC, and WMA formats. </p> <p>Technicalities aside, what is it really like to be able to carry an entire record collection around in your hand? I have always listened to music en route to places. In fact, I used to be late for work every day because I couldn't decide on a selection of CDs to take with me to play in my Discman. </p> <p>Similarly, my one gripe with my last MP3 player was the pain of having to delete everything then transfer a new album on to it whenever I wanted to listen to something new. </p> <p>Those problems simply don't exist any more. I have about 100 albums on my Jukebox at the moment, and I just grab the player and my headphones on the way out of the door, knowing that whether I want to listen to Talvin Singh, The Clash or The Byrds, it's all there, accessible in seconds. </p> <p>You can search by album, artist or genre, queue up a few albums to listen to, or pick individual tracks and then save the resulting playlist on the Jukebox to play another time. </p> <p>At the same time, the Jukebox can be oddly unsatisfying. The best analogy is probably that of the child let loose in the sweet shop. </p> <p>If you have a finicky CD Discman or MiniDisc, and you want to change the disc you are listening to, you know that will involve effort. </p> <p> But with the Jukebox, you aren't constrained in the same way, only by the range of your record collection. So having borrowed the new Richard Ashcroft album from a friend at work (and copied it straight on to my Jukebox), I'm still to get past the second track. </p> <p>Listening to a new album requires an element of discipline, as you get to grips with songs that you've never heard before. Why would I want to do that when I have pretty much every one of my all-time favourite albums sitting just a few clicks away on my Jukebox? </p> <p>Minor worries about the future of our music-listening habits aside, Creative Labs will still need a small riot squad armed with boltcutters to get my new toy off me. </p> <p>I'm not crazy about the Dap prefix but, for once, an IT company has come up with the perfect product name. It really is like owning the best pub jukebox you ever heard.</p>",

      "bodyText": "I have a new toy and it is attracting quite a bit of attention. Workmates come over to my desk, pick up the gleaming new toy, \"ooh\" and \"aah\" as if it's November 5, and then ask how much the toy is going to cost when it comes out. My answer ensures the same response from everyone - they quickly put it down and walk off before they risk damaging it. And the cause of all this excitement? The next generation of MP3 player, Creative Labs' Dap Jukebox. Dap stands for digital audio player, a term which Creative Labs is keen to stress as the Jukebox is designed to do far more than simply play MP3 files. Yes, the estimated price of \u00a3349 might make you flinch, but the Jukebox makes every other player on the market look ready for the retirement home. And while it is roughly twice the price of other players on the market, it offers much more than twice the performance. The fact that it has been designed as a curvy, silver delight doesn't harm matters either. It is not the Dap Jukebox's looks that have got reviewers in a tizz, though. The Jukebox can pack up to 200 albums of MP3 files on to its 6GB of memory (the higher the quality of the encoding, the larger the file size - 200 albums is possible at a 96kbps bit-rate). Creative Labs has made the whole process of retrieving tracks off a CD on to the player as painless as possible, as long as you have an internet connection. As soon as a new CD is placed into your PC's CD drive, the program goes off to the CD DataBase on the internet, identifies the album, artist and even genre (this takes a few seconds), then begins the process of copying it on to the PC's hard drive and encoding each track into the chosen audio format. Each CD should take 15 minutes to copy. You can also plug speakers into the back of the Jukebox via its two stereo line-in sockets. The Jukebox also uses firmware software, meaning that its operating system can be upgraded to take account of new digital formats. This is highly significant, given that MP3 has only a limited shelf-life as the standard digital audio format. Microsoft is currently leading the pack of would-be successors with its Windows Media Audio (WMA) format, which offers better quality and smaller file sizes than MP3, as does Dolby's pioneering Audio Acoustic Coding (AAC) format. Creative Labs is promising that the Jukebox will be able to read MP3, WAV, AAC, and WMA formats. Technicalities aside, what is it really like to be able to carry an entire record collection around in your hand? I have always listened to music en route to places. In fact, I used to be late for work every day because I couldn't decide on a selection of CDs to take with me to play in my Discman. Similarly, my one gripe with my last MP3 player was the pain of having to delete everything then transfer a new album on to it whenever I wanted to listen to something new. Those problems simply don't exist any more. I have about 100 albums on my Jukebox at the moment, and I just grab the player and my headphones on the way out of the door, knowing that whether I want to listen to Talvin Singh, The Clash or The Byrds, it's all there, accessible in seconds. You can search by album, artist or genre, queue up a few albums to listen to, or pick individual tracks and then save the resulting playlist on the Jukebox to play another time. At the same time, the Jukebox can be oddly unsatisfying. The best analogy is probably that of the child let loose in the sweet shop. If you have a finicky CD Discman or MiniDisc, and you want to change the disc you are listening to, you know that will involve effort. But with the Jukebox, you aren't constrained in the same way, only by the range of your record collection. So having borrowed the new Richard Ashcroft album from a friend at work (and copied it straight on to my Jukebox), I'm still to get past the second track. Listening to a new album requires an element of discipline, as you get to grips with songs that you've never heard before. Why would I want to do that when I have pretty much every one of my all-time favourite albums sitting just a few clicks away on my Jukebox? Minor worries about the future of our music-listening habits aside, Creative Labs will still need a small riot squad armed with boltcutters to get my new toy off me. I'm not crazy about the Dap prefix but, for once, an IT company has come up with the perfect product name. It really is like owning the best pub jukebox you ever heard.",

It works with both digital and analogue TV systems. </p> <p>The introduction of TiVo in the US nearly two years ago generated acres of press coverage, largely on account of the TV companies' fears that users would never watch an advert again. Others, Dyke included, believe that once users have mastered the unit's electronic programming guide, traditional TV schedules will be jettisoned. </p> <p>Yet PVRs like TiVo and its rival in the US, Replay TV, have hardly captured the TV viewing public's imagination. </p> <p>Both TiVo and Replay went on sale in the US in early 1999. Since their launch, combined sales for both systems have been less than 100,000 units. Although industry pundits predict sales will reach around 400,000 by the end of the year, that's still very small beer in a nation of committed couch potatoes. That figure is made to look even more modest compared with the enormous take up in the US of DVD players. </p> <p>So will it fare any better over here? </p> <p>Not surprisingly, Sky's director of new product development Brian Sullivan believes so. He's banking on sales of up to 100,000 units in the first 18 months to two years of the product's life. He also feels that some of the reasons why sales have been sluggish in the US don't apply to the UK. </p> <p>\"In the US the product was clearly over-priced, with early units selling for $1,000. Also it was a new product category. Britons have been hearing about the product for two years now and are more aware of it than the Americans were when it launched over there.\" </p> <p>Sullivan is also believes that Britain is a nation of time-shifters. The TiVo box sports a facility called a Season Pass that will automatically record every episode of a particular programme. For a nation addicted to soaps it could prove to be a winning feature. </p> <p>The Sky/TiVo unit is unlikely to be the only PVR using hard disk storage on sale in the UK for long. Sky has already announced the spring arrival of XTV, an enhanced Sky Digital decoder that also features an integrated PVR manufactured in the UK by Pace Micro Technologies and NDS Technologies, part of the News International stable. The XTV unit will boast two digital tuners enabling, for the first time, Sky Digital viewers to watch one satellite channel while recording another. </p> <p>Other manufacturers, such as Nokia, Bush and Philips, have also unveiled prototype PVRs, though they are unlikely to reach the market until the companies have secured deals with broadcasters to programme information. </p> <p>One company the trio would dearly love to secure a deal with is ONdigital. In spite of constant speculation, including rumours of a tie-in with TiVo's rival Replay TV, the digital broadcaster has refused to give anything away. Company spokesperson Andrew Marre admits that \"personal video recorders are on the company's roadmap, but not for a long time and not at the kind of price Sky is charging\". </p> <p> The success of the TiVo box may hinge on whether a nation that still can't programme its VCRs can work its way round TiVo's operating system. </p> <p>Fortunately, the TiVo system is very simple to use. One click on the remote control brings up TiVo Central, the system's menu page. Recording a programme involves browsing the on-screen listings, which feature two weeks' worth of schedules at a time, finding what you want to record and clicking on it. Users can also use the system's search option to discover, for example, if a certain film will be shown in the next couple of weeks. </p> <p>But the search is limited to programme titles. An obvious enhancement for the MK II version would be a keyword search, so for example you could type in Coventry City, and all the programmes that mention the football club would flash up. </p> <p>Users are offered a choice of recording quality for the programme. On best quality, the hard drive will store up to 14 hours of programming. Using the lowest quality, the system can archive up to 40 hours of TV in a standard akin to long play mode on VCRs. </p> <p>Viewers can also rate the programmes they have recorded using the TiVo's thumbs up system. As the system develops a bank of information about the user's viewing habits, it begins to make suggestions as to programmes they might enjoy. It will also automatically record some programmes if it is confident that the user would not want to miss them. </p> <p>According to Sky's research the system's trump card could be its ability to pause live TV. Users can either continue to watch the programme from the point they stopped or return to seeing it in real time. Thanks to the unit's buffer system, users can also instantly jump back eight seconds, a feature sure to prove popular with sports fans looking for instant replays of controversial incidents. </p> <p>While there's no denying that the TiVo system is capable of some rather neat tricks, it is essentially a video recorder. So will the notoriously price-conscious British public be prepared to spend \u00a3600, when \u00a3250 buys a fairly sophisticated Nicam Stereo VCR? Sky's marketing team certainly has an interesting 12 months to look forward to. </p> <p><strong> How Tivo works</strong><br> Buy a TiVo system and you are in actually installing a mini PC under your TV. The box uses the Linux open-source operating system, contains a 50Mz Power PC processor and boasts a 40 gigabyte hard drive. </p> <p>To record programmes, the TiVo system takes the analogue signal from your TV aerial and using its MPEG encoder chip converts it into digital binary code which it then stores on its hard drive.

The company has announced that a plug-in GSM phone module will go on sale in the US in December and probably arrive here next spring. Dubbed the Visorphone, the module features a battery, speaker, antenna, a series of buttons and a headset. </p> <p>It will sync with the Handspring's Palm-based personal information manager (PIM), so it can access numbers already stored in it. The module will also enable users to send e-mails and surf the net, although they must first download a web browser for the device. Handspring in the UK could not say which phone networks the module will support, or its price. It's expected to cost around $300. Several companies are working on similar modules for the Palm series of PDAs, although these are not expected to go on sale until the end of next year at the earliest. Also on sale in the USA - and expected here next year - is an MP3 player module for the Handspring. </p> <p><strong> Instant image</strong></p> <p> Ever wanted to email an image seconds after you've taken it? That's the key facility on the \u00a3350 Casio Message-Cam, which goes on sale next month through Vodafone stores. It's essentially a touch-screen PDA which features a digital camera, voice recorder and all the usual organiser facilities. However, it's bundled with a Siemens C35 Wap mobile phone which uses the Vodafone network. Connect the two together and thanks to the Message-Cam web browser, you'll be able to surf the internet and send both text and pictures by email. (AN)</p> <p> <strong> Your diary on your wrist</strong><br> Seiko Epson has come up with a watch that doubles as a PDA complete with a personal information manager (PIM). </p> <p>The Chrono-bit wristwatch performs the functions of a supercompact computer and can sync up with schedule and contact data from Microsoft Outlook 2000/98/ 97, Lotus Notes R5/R4.6, and Lotus Organiser 2000. </p> <p>Data from the PIM is synchronised with the watch by pressing a button on its \"synchro-station\" via a cradle connected to a PC. </p> <p>Characters and numbers can also be entered manually using the watch's revolving bezel-type keyboard. The watch is water resistant, and will be available in the stainless steel and plastic versions. </p> <p>Priced at \u00a3300 for the Japanese market, the Chrono-bit does not yet have a UK release date. </p> <p>Chrono-bit now joins other gadget watches already available in Japan, including a fully functional watch that can take digital pictures, send them via email, and play music files.

      "bodyText": "Speak easily Handspring Visor owners could soon be using their PDA (personal digital assistant) to make phone calls. The company has announced that a plug-in GSM phone module will go on sale in the US in December and probably arrive here next spring. Dubbed the Visorphone, the module features a battery, speaker, antenna, a series of buttons and a headset. It will sync with the Handspring's Palm-based personal information manager (PIM), so it can access numbers already stored in it. The module will also enable users to send e-mails and surf the net, although they must first download a web browser for the device. Handspring in the UK could not say which phone networks the module will support, or its price. It's expected to cost around $300. Several companies are working on similar modules for the Palm series of PDAs, although these are not expected to go on sale until the end of next year at the earliest. Also on sale in the USA - and expected here next year - is an MP3 player module for the Handspring. Instant image Ever wanted to email an image seconds after you've taken it? That's the key facility on the \u00a3350 Casio Message-Cam, which goes on sale next month through Vodafone stores. It's essentially a touch-screen PDA which features a digital camera, voice recorder and all the usual organiser facilities. However, it's bundled with a Siemens C35 Wap mobile phone which uses the Vodafone network. Connect the two together and thanks to the Message-Cam web browser, you'll be able to surf the internet and send both text and pictures by email. (AN) Your diary on your wrist Seiko Epson has come up with a watch that doubles as a PDA complete with a personal information manager (PIM). The Chrono-bit wristwatch performs the functions of a supercompact computer and can sync up with schedule and contact data from Microsoft Outlook 2000/98/ 97, Lotus Notes R5/R4.6, and Lotus Organiser 2000. Data from the PIM is synchronised with the watch by pressing a button on its \"synchro-station\" via a cradle connected to a PC. Characters and numbers can also be entered manually using the watch's revolving bezel-type keyboard. The watch is water resistant, and will be available in the stainless steel and plastic versions. Priced at \u00a3300 for the Japanese market, the Chrono-bit does not yet have a UK release date. Chrono-bit now joins other gadget watches already available in Japan, including a fully functional watch that can take digital pictures, send them via email, and play music files. Other models offer wireless communications and GPS (satellite positioning) functions.

There's been a \"consumer\" (read \"citizen\") revolt against raw capitalism, an implication strangely absent from much of the coverage in the net press. </p> <p>Neither does he directly mention \"censorware\" like NetNanny and others, and the implications of unrestrained, privatised, largely American censors deciding what is accessible to kids and others forced to use filtered net access (including workers in offices denied access to trade union sites). </p> <p>The one point that had me flummoxed was his claim that Dreamweaver and Photoshop \"make artists indirectly censor themselves\".

Let's hope most Mac users take a more positive attitude than Mr McGill. <br> <strong> Cameron Paterson</strong> <br> <a href=\"mailto:cameronp@lineone.net\">cameronp@lineone.net</a> </p> <p> As the kind of Mac user who uses her Mac the way she uses her car - if it goes I'm happy and don't even want to think about why - I welcomed Craig McGill's piece on Mac's OS X. </p> <p>It was a model of clarity in the way it spelled out the new operating system's downside. It was positively user-friendly - rather like the Macs I know and love, come to think of it. </p> <p>What a pity Apple seems to be heading off into unfamiliar territory. I guess I'll just have to look after my herd of aging dinosaurs (from Classic to iMac OS 9) and hope they don't all die on me. <br> <strong> Christine Findlay</strong> <br> <a href=\"mailto:christine@maura.demon.co.uk\">christine@maura.demon.co.uk</a> </p> <p><strong> Censorship</strong><br> John Carr's response to my article about blocking software (Second Sight, September 21) might have been more informative to readers had he noted that he and his wife, Labour Peer Baroness Thornton, were active in promoting the Regulation of Investigatory Powers bill and that Carr has long advocated the imposition of blocking software in public libraries as well as schools. </p> <p>I also found it interesting that he referred to my alleged desire to look at pornography myself, since I have told him before that I do not use pornography recreationally and have managed to avoid seeing it on the internet by the no-doubt complicated hi-tech trick of not clicking on it. </p> <p>Although Mr Carr claims to plead for tolerance and freedom of choice, he apparently wishes that only his own choice be observed in public and educational facilities. </p> <p>Some of us would choose otherwise, preferring not to impose repression on young people when we know that it correlates so highly with sex crime. </p> <p>Mr Carr may wish to avoid pornography, but I find this less compelling than my desire to avoid promoting rape. </p> <p>He also ignored the substance of my article, which pointed out that blocking software does not simply block pornography, but also blocks a great deal of material that is not pornographic or even related to problematic subjects. </p> <p>Most importantly, the software may block words like \"Playboy\", \"pornography\" and \"breasts\", but cannot be relied upon to do what it claims to do, which is block most erotic images. Why should the government waste money on an obstructive, intrusive policy that does not work? </p> <p>Unfortunately, Mr Carr's letter is typical of the calibre of debate we have come to expect from the proponents of censorship and, alas, from government, who ignore the facts and instead repeat indefinitely things that are not true and do more harm than good. <br> <strong> Avedon Carol</strong> <br> <a href=\"mailto:avedon@cix.compulink.co.uk\">avedon@cix.compulink.co.uk</a></p>",

Jason Staines jstaines@postmaster.co.uk Missed out I'm staggered that the Sinclair Spectrum didn't make the PC timeline: after all, it defined computing for British kids in the 80s, while Apple and DOS boxes remained impossibly expensive imports. (Didn't any of your writers remember Sinclair Research Ltd?) No sign of Amstrad, either, though its PCWs were the first to bring word processing to many British homes. Nick Sweeney nick@nonspace.org Welcome read Douglas Rushkoff's take on net censorship (Second Sight September 28) got much right and was a very welcome contribution on a mostly ignored subject. He could have drawn out the thread of the implications of napster a bit more. There's been a \"consumer\" (read \"citizen\") revolt against raw capitalism, an implication strangely absent from much of the coverage in the net press. Neither does he directly mention \"censorware\" like NetNanny and others, and the implications of unrestrained, privatised, largely American censors deciding what is accessible to kids and others forced to use filtered net access (including workers in offices denied access to trade union sites). The one point that had me flummoxed was his claim that Dreamweaver and Photoshop \"make artists indirectly censor themselves\". Please explain. Paul Canning cann03ing@yahoo.com New look Mac Craig McGill's review of OS X (Online, September 28) could be boiled down to one sentence: \"It's different, so I don't like it\". He may genuinely prefer the current Mac OS, but perhaps he has forgotten that with a few weeks or even days of unbiased use, the quirks and differences of OS X could become equally familiar. The loss of familiar landmarks like the Apple menu, for instance, may be disorientating at first but OS X includes new and powerful ways of navigating through the system. A modern Mac OS with pre-emptive multitasking and protected memory is years overdue. Let's hope most Mac users take a more positive attitude than Mr McGill. Cameron Paterson cameronp@lineone.net As the kind of Mac user who uses her Mac the way she uses her car - if it goes I'm happy and don't even want to think about why - I welcomed Craig McGill's piece on Mac's OS X. It was a model of clarity in the way it spelled out the new operating system's downside. It was positively user-friendly - rather like the Macs I know and love, come to think of it. What a pity Apple seems to be heading off into unfamiliar territory. I guess I'll just have to look after my herd of aging dinosaurs (from Classic to iMac OS 9) and hope they don't all die on me. Christine Findlay christine@maura.demon.co.uk Censorship John Carr's response to my article about blocking software (Second Sight, September 21) might have been more informative to readers had he noted that he and his wife, Labour Peer Baroness Thornton, were active in promoting the Regulation of Investigatory Powers bill and that Carr has long advocated the imposition of blocking software in public libraries as well as schools. I also found it interesting that he referred to my alleged desire to look at pornography myself, since I have told him before that I do not use pornography recreationally and have managed to avoid seeing it on the internet by the no-doubt complicated hi-tech trick of not clicking on it. Although Mr Carr claims to plead for tolerance and freedom of choice, he apparently wishes that only his own choice be observed in public and educational facilities. Some of us would choose otherwise, preferring not to impose repression on young people when we know that it correlates so highly with sex crime. Mr Carr may wish to avoid pornography, but I find this less compelling than my desire to avoid promoting rape. He also ignored the substance of my article, which pointed out that blocking software does not simply block pornography, but also blocks a great deal of material that is not pornographic or even related to problematic subjects. Most importantly, the software may block words like \"Playboy\", \"pornography\" and \"breasts\", but cannot be relied upon to do what it claims to do, which is block most erotic images. Why should the government waste money on an obstructive, intrusive policy that does not work? Unfortunately, Mr Carr's letter is typical of the calibre of debate we have come to expect from the proponents of censorship and, alas, from government, who ignore the facts and instead repeat indefinitely things that are not true and do more harm than good.
