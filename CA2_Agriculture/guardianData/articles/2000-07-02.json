A range of measures to stamp out drunken hooliganism will be on the agenda when chief constables meet the prime minister and the home secretary, Jack Straw, at No 10. Among them will be powers to allow a senior police officer to shut a pub on the spot for up to 48 hours if there is a threat to public safety. Courts may also be able to impose orders prohibiting known troublemakers from going into pubs, with life bans for the worst offenders. The announcement of this crime initiative, which has been heavily trailed, follows an angry and sceptical reaction to Mr Blair's proposal of on-the-spot fines for Saturday night hooligans. His proposal, made to an audience of students during a visit to Germany on Friday, was greeted with dismay by supporters of civil liberties. The radical QC Michael Mansfield said it made the police \"judge and jury to fine people on the spot\". The The Liberal Democrat leader, Charles Kennedy, described the idea as \"daft\". He said on BBC1's Breakfast With Frost: \"How are the police actually going to operate that? \"They are not enamoured of this idea of where they're made judge and jury at one and the same time, as well as being the police.\" Today's violent crime summit at Downing Street comes as figures indicated a rise in insurance claims for countryside crime. The insurance firm NFU Mutual said the cost of thefts from homes and businesses in the countryside rose by 6% in 1999, to \u00a3168m. However, the cost of equipment and vehicle thefts from farms fell from \u00a393m in 1998 to \u00a382m last year. NFU Mutual suggested this showed farmers had become more security conscious, but the message had not filtered through to homeowners and businesses.

      "body": "<p>A dentistry company, Oasis Healthcare, is raising \u00a35.3m in an AIM flotation to fund plans for a national network of more than 100 surgeries. </p> <p>The company already owns 14 surgeries employing 58 dentists mainly in the Midlands. It hopes to persuade Britons of the virtues of having cosmetic work done on their teeth. </p> <p>Malcolm Hughes, the chief executive, said: \"Dentistry is not just about clinical efficiency but about something crucially important to people - their smile.\" </p> <p>Americans routinely paid for improvements to their teeth, regarding dentistry as just another consumer purchase. This attitude had yet to reach Britain. \"We don't see a smile as something we can buy in, whereas in the US they do.\" </p> <p>Oasis was founded four years ago by a dentist in the north of England but ran into trouble because of a lack of financial backing. New management took over in 1998 and Mr Hughes, a former managing director of Vernons pools, was appointed earlier this year. The business floated on Ofex early last year. It is likely to be valued at more than \u00a311m on AIM. </p> <p>Mr Hughes believes underfunding in the national health service is making life difficult for independent dentists. Many want to join larger organisations, to save money on purchasing equipment and to pay for marketing campaigns advertising cosmetic work. </p> <p>Oasis says just under half of British adults visit their dentists less than once a year and only 45% are registered with NHS practices.

      "bodyText": "A dentistry company, Oasis Healthcare, is raising \u00a35.3m in an AIM flotation to fund plans for a national network of more than 100 surgeries. The company already owns 14 surgeries employing 58 dentists mainly in the Midlands. It hopes to persuade Britons of the virtues of having cosmetic work done on their teeth. Malcolm Hughes, the chief executive, said: \"Dentistry is not just about clinical efficiency but about something crucially important to people - their smile.\" Americans routinely paid for improvements to their teeth, regarding dentistry as just another consumer purchase. This attitude had yet to reach Britain. \"We don't see a smile as something we can buy in, whereas in the US they do.\" Oasis was founded four years ago by a dentist in the north of England but ran into trouble because of a lack of financial backing. New management took over in 1998 and Mr Hughes, a former managing director of Vernons pools, was appointed earlier this year. The business floated on Ofex early last year. It is likely to be valued at more than \u00a311m on AIM. Mr Hughes believes underfunding in the national health service is making life difficult for independent dentists. Many want to join larger organisations, to save money on purchasing equipment and to pay for marketing campaigns advertising cosmetic work. Oasis says just under half of British adults visit their dentists less than once a year and only 45% are registered with NHS practices. Although many of Oasis' surgeries offer NHS work, the group hopes to take advantage of a trend towards the private sector.",

And are the skills you've learned as a PA likely to be of any use when you're so high up the ladder that you have a personal assistant of your own? Most definitely, claims Barker, who says many of her communication skills were learned during her time as a receptionist for programmes including Time Watch and Paddington Green. But she is modest about her career move into TV presenting, putting it down largely to chance. \"I'm still recovering from the shock of discovering I got the job, as it is a mystery to me how my show reel appeared at the Blue Peter office,\" she explains. \"The first I knew of the job was when I had a call inviting me to audition.

She worked for 18 months on the Evening Leader in north Wales before meeting the violinist Nigel Kennedy, who offered her a job as his PA after a drink. It was then that she began to mix with the big players who would eventually offer her a way into Fleet Street. </p> <p>\"Being a secretary allows you to regularly meet the people who are giving out the jobs. You can earn their respect and get yourself remembered for being efficient and capable. It also allows you to make a huge range of contacts who may come in handy at any given moment,\" explains Shauna Horgan, vice president of the Association of Graduate Careers Advisory Services. \"In secretarial jobs that involve attending social functions, it may sometimes be appropriate to mention in passing your high-flying future career plans.\" </p> <p>Best-selling author Jilly Cooper spent eight years as a secretary before landing the column on the Sunday Times that led to her career as a novelist.

This is particularly important since secretarial work is recognised as being far higher status than it used to be.\" </p> <p>Sarah El Doori, of recruitment consultancy Office Angels, agrees: \"The key is to show you're pro-active. If you want to be picked out from the crowd, you need to make it clear that you can find solutions to problems - both big and small.\" </p> <p>Former PA Anthea Turner claims that she has her secretarial days to thank for her organisational skills. In addition, she believes, it has enabled her to work well with her current PA, Alison Astall, which has made a huge difference to her working life. Perceiving your relationship with your PA as a partnership rather than a power relationship, she says, gives them both a chance to reach their full potential. \"What I like about Alison is that she is forthright,\" said Turner recently. \"If she doesn't think something is working, she says so.\" </p> <p>Even if you don't get the fame, there's still a hope of getting the fortune. Look no further than Carly Fiorina, once a secretary at the computer company Hewlett Packard, and now its chief executive, earning a reported \u00a350m over three years. Others who have followed in the career trail of Melanie Griffiths in the movie Working Girl - where she moved from PA to principal - include Tina Fotherby, managing director of PR firm The Yes Company, and Ben Hampshire, special effects producer. Both Fotherby, who began in 1979 as a junior secretary on weekly magazines at IPC, and Hampshire, who claims he \"could not even type\" when he started out as William Hurt's PA, claim total loyalty is essential if you want any kind of high- profile role. Trust is everything, they say, particularly in the media. </p> <p>\"Watch everything and everyone around you like a hawk,\" adds Richard Smith, manager of a recruitment consultancy who began his career as a clerical worker. \"You need to learn as much as possible without actually being taught it. And never assume you have to do the same jobs every day. Take the initiative and think creatively whenever you can.\" A competitive edge and a fighting instinct won't go amiss either, he adds. </p> <p>Some secretarial roles, though, - such as those in the legal and medical worlds - have the reputation of hitting the glass ceiling with a thump, leaving no opportunities for high- flyers. \"But,\" says Emma Cummerford, a solicitor from Chesham who began her career as an office junior for a law firm, \"although it takes a long time and a lot of hard work to make it in this field, your experience as a legal secretary undoubtedly puts you at an advantage in terms of legal knowledge, jargon and contacts.\" </p> <p>Cummerford believes many legal secretaries are put off by the hard slog ahead. Unlike, say, the media, success depends on qualifications rather than talent-spotting. \"My degree took me two evenings a week for four years.

But I've come out with a job that is totally secure and extremely fulfilling.\" Although the prospects are bleaker for medical secretaries who want to become medical practitioners, the British Society of Medical Secretaries is quick to point out that secretaries are increasingly moving into management roles within surgeries and hospitals. </p> <p>Not surprisingly, recruitment agencies report that graduates are taking up roles as secretaries and PAs faster than ever. \"They have realised it's one of the best stepping stones into their chosen career,\" says Caroline Foote, managing director of recruitment consultants Career Moves. \"Many of them - particularly in the media - are seeking top jobs and see this as a way in.\" They're lucky, she says, because 10 years ago, secretaries required formal training. Now, however, graduates finish their studies and realise they have a good typing speed, impressive knowledge of computer software, admirable communication skills and a good brain - all the things that a modern PA needs.

      "body": "<p>Madonna lives around the corner, and both Richard Branson and Bill Gates have homes close by - this is London's obscenely trendy Notting Hill Gate, home also to Foxtons estate agents' first branch, established more than 20 years ago. The window is full of beautiful pictures of homes to sell your soul for - and you might need to, with prices ranging from \u00a3120,000 for a studio flat to \u00a36m for a mansion. </p> <p>Inside, a dozen or so young men talk into telephone headsets at a hasty pace that lets customers know that they've got places to go, people to see and hot property to sell. Sales team secretary Sarah Wilkinson, 32, is getting used to the atmosphere, having just completed her three-month probationary period. \"I worked at a branch of Rothschilds bank for three years before coming here so I was used to a very corporate environment, very suited, where you have to mind your Ps and Qs. I took voluntary redundancy and was looking for a place that was completely different,\" she explains. </p> <p>\"I really wanted somewhere a little more dynamic but still a little bit taxing. I want to work hard and still go for a drink with the gang afterwards. I wasn't getting that before - I was the second youngest in the office and here I'm the oldest. I'm older than my two managers, which was a bit of a shock, really,\" she says. </p> <p>After leaving school at 16, all of Wilkinson's secretarial skills were learnt on the job - she has an impressive typing speed of 80wpm. \"I learnt to type while I was working as a receptionist at a hotel. I picked it up as I went along. I'm naturally quite dexterous,\" she says. Another secretary at Foxtons' Kensington branch provided the training for this job in an intensive three days. </p> <p>Wilkinson rarely takes lunch breaks, preferring to get her head down - the greatest challenge in this job, she says, is trying to clear the sheer volume of work. Three months in the job and she can recite the whole estate agent's procedure: \"Basically the process of buying and selling a house is very much like a production line. There are very set functions for each stage of the process. It begins with an evaluation and I'll type up the first letter telling a customer how much their property is worth, all about our fees and our marketing policies. </p> <p>\"If they instruct us, we have to get a set of details together which means ordering the floor plans and getting the photographer round there. Pictures are sent to me digitally by email. I collate them and type up the details of the property, then compile a brochure for the client's approval; they have to agree with our terms and conditions and, once everything is approved, the details go in the window.

      "bodyText": "Madonna lives around the corner, and both Richard Branson and Bill Gates have homes close by - this is London's obscenely trendy Notting Hill Gate, home also to Foxtons estate agents' first branch, established more than 20 years ago. The window is full of beautiful pictures of homes to sell your soul for - and you might need to, with prices ranging from \u00a3120,000 for a studio flat to \u00a36m for a mansion. Inside, a dozen or so young men talk into telephone headsets at a hasty pace that lets customers know that they've got places to go, people to see and hot property to sell. Sales team secretary Sarah Wilkinson, 32, is getting used to the atmosphere, having just completed her three-month probationary period. \"I worked at a branch of Rothschilds bank for three years before coming here so I was used to a very corporate environment, very suited, where you have to mind your Ps and Qs. I took voluntary redundancy and was looking for a place that was completely different,\" she explains. \"I really wanted somewhere a little more dynamic but still a little bit taxing. I want to work hard and still go for a drink with the gang afterwards. I wasn't getting that before - I was the second youngest in the office and here I'm the oldest. I'm older than my two managers, which was a bit of a shock, really,\" she says. After leaving school at 16, all of Wilkinson's secretarial skills were learnt on the job - she has an impressive typing speed of 80wpm. \"I learnt to type while I was working as a receptionist at a hotel. I picked it up as I went along. I'm naturally quite dexterous,\" she says. Another secretary at Foxtons' Kensington branch provided the training for this job in an intensive three days. Wilkinson rarely takes lunch breaks, preferring to get her head down - the greatest challenge in this job, she says, is trying to clear the sheer volume of work. Three months in the job and she can recite the whole estate agent's procedure: \"Basically the process of buying and selling a house is very much like a production line. There are very set functions for each stage of the process. It begins with an evaluation and I'll type up the first letter telling a customer how much their property is worth, all about our fees and our marketing policies. \"If they instruct us, we have to get a set of details together which means ordering the floor plans and getting the photographer round there. Pictures are sent to me digitally by email. I collate them and type up the details of the property, then compile a brochure for the client's approval; they have to agree with our terms and conditions and, once everything is approved, the details go in the window. I have to sort out sales memoranda and letters to solicitors and I'll do all the invoicing right up until we receive the cheque,\" she says, without pausing for breath. Her office is on the first floor, away from the hubbub of the sales team. \"I'm my own person up here. No one is hanging over me. I'm used to having someone looking over my shoulder a bit more, but I'm very much left to my own devices and it helps that I'm very disciplined,\" she says. Foxtons has to be very image conscious, with branches in some of the most sought-after locations in London. The image also tends to attract a particular kind of staff, explains Wilkinson. \"They have to be the Foxtons personality, which is young, vibrant - they have to have a personality, basically. People who want to work and then go for a glass of wine afterwards. We all work hard and play hard which is exactly how it should be - I'd rather have that then work a little bit and go home bored and miserable. Wouldn't you?\"",

      "body": "<p>Last week, a prosecutor in Italy launched an investigation into the death of a bank worker to determine whether her employer and colleagues should be tried for her manslaughter. And their alleged weapon? Cigarettes. </p> <p>Ten months ago, the 35-year-old woman collapsed at her desk in a Milan bank and died of an acute asthma attack. Her family claim that, although the bank was aware that she suffered from the illness - she had been employed under a scheme that gives tax incentives to employers who hire people with physical impairments - she had to work in a badly ventilated room, surrounded by persistent smokers. Her repeated requests to be moved were ignored. The prosecutor must now decide whether those who continued to smoke around her should be charged with her death. </p> <p>Health and safety legislation in this country has done much to protect the rights of non-smokers, but it is not inconceivable that this might happen in Britain. There are still many workplaces, often small businesses where the boss smokes or where the issue has never been raised, that do not restrict smoking. </p> <p>However, an increasing number of smoking policies are appearing in the workplace. Quite apart from the health risks associated with smoking - active or passive - many employers are worried about reduced productivity because of smoking breaks, or absenteeism because of ill health. Smoking can also pile on the costs for firms, with extra cleaning and redecoration, special ventilation requirements, separate facilities for smokers and higher fire insurance premiums than for smoking-free premises. </p> <p>Action on Smoking and Health (Ash) recommends that employers develop a smoking policy in consultation with employees. An employer has a duty to protect staff from harmful substances - and that includes tobacco smoke - but imposing a total smoking ban may create new problems: 28% of adults regularly light up, and that's a lot of potentially demotivated workers. </p> <p>Ash suggests that a successful policy should include a timetable of changes; support for those trying to quit, a decision on whether there will be a smoking room (and, if so, for how long), plus rules on breaks. </p> <p>Many workplaces that once had designated smoking areas have now opted for a total ban on lighting up in the building. It hasn't solved the problem: instead, smokers tend to congregate around entrances, and non-smokers resent being left to cover for their colleagues. </p> <p>Two and a half years ago, when non-smoking staff at Harlow council expressed concern at this, bosses implemented a policy by which smokers must make up the time spent on breaks. All staff work under a flexitime arrangement of 37 hours a week and any employee who leaves the building for a cigarette must indicate this on his or her timesheet. </p> <p>Welwyn and Hatfield council allow staff to smoke in designated areas outside the building and had planned to ban smoking entirely in April this year. However, research showed that the staff members were not adequately prepared to deal with the new regulations and they will be allowed to continue to smoke in those areas until April 2001, when the policy will be reviewed. </p> <p>Many employers are getting around the problem by offering support to employees who want to quit - from nicotine patches to hypnosis. More help is on the way in the form of Zyban, a groundbreaking anti-smoking pill, which, it was announced last week, is to be available on NHS prescription. </p> <p>But what about the people who don't wish to stop smoking, but accept that some restrictions are necessary? The Freedom Organisation for the Right to Enjoy Smoking Tobacco (Forest) points out that employers have a duty to ensure the welfare of all employees, including smokers. It points to alternatives such as better ventilation and air-cleaning systems, a compromise which, though expensive, benefits smokers and non-smokers. And those who think it fair to penalise people for cigarette breaks might like to consider the number of non-smokers in any office who have more coffee breaks and personal phone calls than are strictly necessary. </p> <p>Smoking is a highly emotive issue - it is easy to demonise those who continued to puff away at the Milan bank - but the future does not look bright for smokers. The Health and Safety Commission will shortly be publishing its code of practice on passive smoking and is urging a complete ban on workplace smoking that could come into operation as early as next year. But there are those who doubt that office smoking can be stubbed out. Employers will not want to lose able people simply because they smoke and, while many will be offering smoke cessation therapy, they will also have to accept that some people, whatever the health risks, simply do not want to stop.</p> <p><strong>Useful links</strong></p> <p>Action on Smoking and Health (Ash), tel: 020 7739 5902; <a href=\"http://www.ash.org.uk\">www.ash.org.uk</a></p> <p>Freedom Organisation for the Right to Enjoy Smoking Tobacco (Forest), tel: 020 7233 6155; <a href=\"http://www.forest-on-smoking.org.uk\">www.forest-on-smoking.org.uk</a></p>",

Her repeated requests to be moved were ignored. The prosecutor must now decide whether those who continued to smoke around her should be charged with her death. Health and safety legislation in this country has done much to protect the rights of non-smokers, but it is not inconceivable that this might happen in Britain. There are still many workplaces, often small businesses where the boss smokes or where the issue has never been raised, that do not restrict smoking. However, an increasing number of smoking policies are appearing in the workplace. Quite apart from the health risks associated with smoking - active or passive - many employers are worried about reduced productivity because of smoking breaks, or absenteeism because of ill health. Smoking can also pile on the costs for firms, with extra cleaning and redecoration, special ventilation requirements, separate facilities for smokers and higher fire insurance premiums than for smoking-free premises. Action on Smoking and Health (Ash) recommends that employers develop a smoking policy in consultation with employees. An employer has a duty to protect staff from harmful substances - and that includes tobacco smoke - but imposing a total smoking ban may create new problems: 28% of adults regularly light up, and that's a lot of potentially demotivated workers. Ash suggests that a successful policy should include a timetable of changes; support for those trying to quit, a decision on whether there will be a smoking room (and, if so, for how long), plus rules on breaks. Many workplaces that once had designated smoking areas have now opted for a total ban on lighting up in the building. It hasn't solved the problem: instead, smokers tend to congregate around entrances, and non-smokers resent being left to cover for their colleagues. Two and a half years ago, when non-smoking staff at Harlow council expressed concern at this, bosses implemented a policy by which smokers must make up the time spent on breaks. All staff work under a flexitime arrangement of 37 hours a week and any employee who leaves the building for a cigarette must indicate this on his or her timesheet. Welwyn and Hatfield council allow staff to smoke in designated areas outside the building and had planned to ban smoking entirely in April this year. However, research showed that the staff members were not adequately prepared to deal with the new regulations and they will be allowed to continue to smoke in those areas until April 2001, when the policy will be reviewed. Many employers are getting around the problem by offering support to employees who want to quit - from nicotine patches to hypnosis. More help is on the way in the form of Zyban, a groundbreaking anti-smoking pill, which, it was announced last week, is to be available on NHS prescription. But what about the people who don't wish to stop smoking, but accept that some restrictions are necessary? The Freedom Organisation for the Right to Enjoy Smoking Tobacco (Forest) points out that employers have a duty to ensure the welfare of all employees, including smokers. It points to alternatives such as better ventilation and air-cleaning systems, a compromise which, though expensive, benefits smokers and non-smokers. And those who think it fair to penalise people for cigarette breaks might like to consider the number of non-smokers in any office who have more coffee breaks and personal phone calls than are strictly necessary. Smoking is a highly emotive issue - it is easy to demonise those who continued to puff away at the Milan bank - but the future does not look bright for smokers. The Health and Safety Commission will shortly be publishing its code of practice on passive smoking and is urging a complete ban on workplace smoking that could come into operation as early as next year. But there are those who doubt that office smoking can be stubbed out. Employers will not want to lose able people simply because they smoke and, while many will be offering smoke cessation therapy, they will also have to accept that some people, whatever the health risks, simply do not want to stop.

And that should be that. But what often occurs is the first bicker of the evening, along the lines of: \"Is that all?\" followed by a sulk and the comment: \"You never tell me anything.\" But what is there to tell? Jargon becomes meaningless outside the office and so do the jobs we do themselves. </p> <p>Most office jobs are confusing and surreal enough to the person actually doing them. Having to explain in plain, layman's terms exactly what you did all day could lead to mental exhaustion bordering on brain seizure.

      "bodyText": "One of the most mind-numbing, toe-curling, bone-marrow-curdling phrases any self-respecting business person can hear is: \"How was your day, then?\" This is always part of the traditional partner greeting rituals and is usually offered without one ounce of apparent interest the minute your briefcase hits the hall linoleum. The stock reply is: \"Ok, thanks\". And that should be that. But what often occurs is the first bicker of the evening, along the lines of: \"Is that all?\" followed by a sulk and the comment: \"You never tell me anything.\" But what is there to tell? Jargon becomes meaningless outside the office and so do the jobs we do themselves. Most office jobs are confusing and surreal enough to the person actually doing them. Having to explain in plain, layman's terms exactly what you did all day could lead to mental exhaustion bordering on brain seizure. How much easier to work in the police force and regale all with the collars you felt during a day on the beat. Or be a lifeguard and describe each life saved in glorious detail. Supplying your loved one with a photocopied version of your daily to do list, with each item ticked off would hardly help.

It is a delight to see an artist like Zinedine Zidane opening up a game; it can be also be absorbing to watch a craftsman like Alessandro Nesta closing one down. Football is not basketball, not simply high-scoring razzmatazz. Its dominant appeal remains in the fact that it is difficult to score, not that it is easy. It is about a contest of wills and contrasts of styles. </p> <p>Professionals having time to think and opportunities to implement, they will continue to find ways of stretching the laws. While, say, Claudio Gentile's terrible treatment of Diego Maradona in the 1982 World Cup could never happen again - hopefully, thankfully - new practices have emerged despite the clean-up. </p> <p>There is still too much diving, feigning injury and shirt-pulling - a response that usually invites more leniency than the tackle from behind but can be equally cloying, defensively - going on, for example.

It must be a double-edged emotion for Pierlugi Collina to see Italy reach the final.

Against Italy, rightly sensing that their opponents' attacking ambition would be limited, they chose - admittedly mainly due to injury - midfield players as full-backs in Paul Bosvelt and Giovanni Van Bronckhorst. It was an acknowledgment of an enlightened Ajax system that has youngsters being rotated positionally so that they do not grow up pigeonholed and limited, unlike often in England where the big kid becomes a centre-half. France now show it too. What would have become of Patrick Vieira in this country? </p> <p>It is also noticeable how the French, everybody's favourite team, resemble what Ars\u00e8ne Wenger is trying to achieve at Arsenal; solid central defenders at ease with the ball, raiding full-backs, midfield shield, a playmaker and swift striker, switching comfortably from 4-5-1 to 4-3-3. Surely there are enough Englishmen to emulate that. </p> <p>Of the several reasons advanced against Wenger as a potential England coach this past week has been that, more and more, he fills these positions with overseas players.

Yes, love is blind, whether for England or for Orange, but it need not give rise to invective. Cowardice does not triumph over a host team fresh from scoring six goals in their previous game. Cowardice does not enable a squad to hold scoreless the tournament co-favourites while playing a man down for 90 minutes. It was appalling to hear Barry Davies, Trevor Brooking and Alan Hansen raving on about how Italy not only did not deserve to win, but how their very existence as a national side threatened to destroy the game as we know it. Just who are the cowards, chaps: Toldo? Nesta? Cannavaro? Maldini? Iuliano? Conte? Albertini? For the final, try getting your heads out of the sand and take note of what is actually happening on the field, instead of pretending you're seeing what you wish you could see. </p> <p><strong> Belief</strong> </p> <p>In themselves. They always thought they'd reach the final, and the force of this collective belief insulated them from the cries of carping critics, who demanded they be a team they are not. All 22 are veterans of Serie A, which means they face maximum pressure every week. It also means they've come to know and respect one another, as players and individuals. Each member of the squad not only believes in himself, but in his team-mates, and no leap of faith is required: only the knowledge acquired through the shared experience of the ferociously rigorous Serie A campaign. They can be likened to the US Marines: the impossible we'll do today; the inconceivable might take a little longer. </p> <p><strong> Brains</strong> </p> <p>They read the game. They play with intelligence. They know their limitations as a group and they adapt. They adapt also to the ever-changing circumstances of a match with an elegance so subtle it often goes unnoticed. When Herbert Spencer wrote about 'the survival of the fittest' he was not referring to mere physical stamina, but to the Darwinian ability to cope with new challenges and to withstand perils to which others succumb. A surprising number of these Italian players - Toldo, Nesta, Cannavaro, Ferrara, Iuliano, Maldini, Di Livio, Albertini, Conte, Fiore, Zambrotta, Montella, Del Piero, at the least - are also highly intelligent, knowledgeable, and quick-thinking individuals off the pitch. These mental attributes can be seen in their play, collectively and individually, and their decisive advantage over most opponents in this department has remained unsung for far too long, as tinpot jingoists blather on instead about their perceived histronics. </p> <p><strong> Background</strong> </p> <p>Seven members of the Italy squad come from Juventus, four from Milan, four from Roma, two from Lazio, two from Fiorentina, and one (who happens to be Cannavaro) from Parma. This is Oxford and Cambridge, and Harvard and Princeton. These are the strongest of the clubs in Serie A. They are winners, and the players chosen from among them have winning as their most significant common denominator: the desire to win, the knowledge of how to do so, and the experience of having done so with great consistency. Not an Everton, Middlesbrough, Fenerbahce, Salamanca, Wolfsburg, Nagoya Grampus Eight, or New York-New Jersey Metrostar alumnus to be found. </p> <p> <strong> Backbone</strong></p> <p>'Their resilience drew gasps of admiration... a remarkable feat of courage and endeavour... Those who expected Italy to crack under pressure do not know their football... awesome, all were giants... more than heroic... generosity of spirit... discipline, organisation and composure... refusing to be overrun...' Those were just a few of the comments in the British press on Friday. One would hope that the BBC biddies might read and learn, instead of continuing to ooze their unctuous inanities. No Italy team had ever won all three first-round matches in a European Championship or World Cup. Eight goals scored, two conceded to date. Not counting the Sweden match, which was really just a friendly, because Italy already were through, they've taken 24 corners and conceded 28. Hardly the mark of a team forever terrified to go forward. And before the semi-final, they had acquired only three yellow cards in four matches, hardly indicative of a team so eager to bring the game into disrepute. </p> <p><strong> Back four</strong></p> <p> As in Nesta, Cannavaro, Maldini and Iuliano. One can quibble about formation and say Italy sometimes use three at the back with Maldini in midfield, but the captain has been, is, and always will be first and foremost a defender, and one who personifies backbone, brains and belief in every match. Nesta and Cannavaro, meanwhile, have become the strongest interior defensive pair in the world, with the unfailing ability, shared by their team-mates, to rise to the level the occasion demands. Iuliano, inserted among them, has consistently found ways to make himself useful. This foursome not only shut down the Dutch physically (Patrick Kluivert will be a long time peeling the shadow of Nesta from his back), but psychologically as well. It was the neurotic and brittle co-hosts who lost both their nerve and their verve in the face of Italy's absolute defensive intransigence. </p> <p><strong> Balance</strong></p> <p> Responsibilities are distributed among all, and willingly accepted. Del Piero and Totti may often seem to play the role of prima donna, but they don't have to be told twice to get back and defend. With Vieri lost to injury, and having chosen (unwisely, in my opinion) to bypass Roberto Baggio, Zoff found himself without the players who had between them scored seven of Italy's eight goals in the World Cup of two years ago. Just as you can only beat the team you're playing, as Gary Lineker has pointed out, you can only play the cards you're holding in your hand. Without a proven striker of international calibre, without any creativity or even pace in midfield (only the untested Fiore being a possible, sporadic exception) Zoff had no choice but to put the bulk of the weight on the shoulders of his defenders. But is this noxious 'negativity' or merely common sense? </p> <p><strong> Brinksmanship</strong></p> <p>The outlandish is commonplace in Italy, hysteria the only rational response to the cruel vicissitudes of fate. Undeniably, Italy have a flair for the dramatic, even if their tactical approach demands the mundane. This causes them to make hard work of easy tasks (see their classic qualifying home and away draws with Belarus), and to become energised and focused only when the high wire on which they're standing starts to tremble, and they see there's no net below. Italy were stronger with 10 men against Holland than with 11, because the 10 felt once again that they had suffered an injustice, and it's the sense of grievance, even more than espresso, that really makes the Italian juices flow. </p> <p><strong> Brotherhood</strong></p> <p>They are not simply a team, they are a family. Ron Atkinson has cogently remarked that among the other reasons France are so strong is that, 'they trust each other with the ball'. This Italy team would trust each other with their lives, not to mention their wives. Which side stood as one, each with an arm around the next man's shoulder, during the penalty phase on Thursday? Which side's substitutes were standing at the end of the match, instead of slumping sullenly in solitary fashion, not even wanting to look at one another, much less hug? The desire to love one another is in their genes, and shared tribulation brings it to the fore. This is by now not so much a football side as a combat-hardened infantry platoon, with an esprit de corps the other teams simply never managed to achieve.

      "body": "<p>The general assumption that Italy's presence will make this a disappointing or overly defensive final may be wide of the mark.</p> <p> In all probability France v Holland would have proved a more open game, but Italy have enough tournament experience to realise playing for penalties is unlikely to work twice. Although their 10-man rearguard action against Holland was awesome, they actually only got through to the final because the Dutch missed two penalties in normal time, which practically amounts to progress by default. </p> <p>Italy cannot rely on that happening again, nor can they afford any more dismissals. To have any chance of beating the French, who incidentally happen to be quite good at penalties, Italy will have to score a goal, preferably an early one, and defend it. They have talented strikers in Filippo Inzaghi, Alessandro del Piero and Francesco Totti, but if they leave them stranded too far upfield against France it will be asking for trouble. </p> <p>An early goal will also be what France are looking for, since it would force Italy to play. French strikers like Thierry Henry and Nicolas Anelka have the pace to trouble Italy's back line, though as Portugal proved in the semi-final, if you defend fairly deep and limit the space for the quick players to run into, even a supply line like Zinedine Zidane can dry up.</p> <p> Zidane should still be the key figure in the final, however.

      "bodyText": "The general assumption that Italy's presence will make this a disappointing or overly defensive final may be wide of the mark. In all probability France v Holland would have proved a more open game, but Italy have enough tournament experience to realise playing for penalties is unlikely to work twice. Although their 10-man rearguard action against Holland was awesome, they actually only got through to the final because the Dutch missed two penalties in normal time, which practically amounts to progress by default. Italy cannot rely on that happening again, nor can they afford any more dismissals. To have any chance of beating the French, who incidentally happen to be quite good at penalties, Italy will have to score a goal, preferably an early one, and defend it. They have talented strikers in Filippo Inzaghi, Alessandro del Piero and Francesco Totti, but if they leave them stranded too far upfield against France it will be asking for trouble. An early goal will also be what France are looking for, since it would force Italy to play. French strikers like Thierry Henry and Nicolas Anelka have the pace to trouble Italy's back line, though as Portugal proved in the semi-final, if you defend fairly deep and limit the space for the quick players to run into, even a supply line like Zinedine Zidane can dry up. Zidane should still be the key figure in the final, however. He is exactly the sort of player the Dutch could have done with in Amsterdam. Holland's creative players were found wanting in the semi-final, but now is the time for the French to show they have that something extra. Already developing an arrogance to match the Germans' at their height, the French are fond of claiming they are the best team in the world, with good reason.

      "body": "<p><strong> FERGIE: YOU WON'T CATCH US </strong> </p> <p>Alex Ferguson has told Premiership rivals: You could spend \u00a3100 million and you still won't catch us. 'This team is capable of holding its own momentum,' says Fergie, 'regardless of what others are doing.' </p> <p> <strong> WENGER EYES UP ZIDANE </strong></p> <p><strong> </strong> Arsene Wenger says he wants Zinedine Zidane - but not for \u00a340m. 'I would love to have him here at Highbury but it is not possible. He's the best in the world in his position: in today's market he'd be worth \u00a340m.' </p> <p> <strong> O'LEARY IN \u00a310M EHIOGU SWOOP </strong></p> <p><strong> </strong> David O'Leary has agreed a \u00a310m Leeds package to rescue unsettled Ugo Ehigou from Aston Villa: he'll offer \u00a35m cash plus Michael Duberry. </p> <p><strong> Arsenal</strong><br> </p> <p>Arsenal are new favourites to land Nuno Gomes. 'We don't intend to sell him,' says <strong> Benfica's </strong> Joao Vale e Azevedo, 'but we couldn't refuse an extraordinary offer.' Arsene Wenger is also watching <strong> Deportivo </strong> star Flavio da Conceicao as a replacement for Marc Overmars, plus Brazilian duo Edu and Edmilson. 'We might take a gamble on them,' says Wenger, 'but it is far from done.' </p> <p><strong> Aston Villa</strong><br> </p> <p>John Gregory will be \u00a34m up by the end of the week - Steve Watson is off to <strong> Everton </strong> for \u00a32m and Mark Draper will sign for <strong> Southampton </strong> for \u00a31.5m. Benito Carbone could also go: he's officially a free agent as of last night. </p> <p><strong> Bradford</strong><br> </p> <p>Geoffrey Richmond says <strong> Newcastle </strong> have no chance of signing keeper Matt Clarke - but Clarke isn't so sure. 'I know they're interested,' he says, 'and they're a big club.' The deal would mean Des Hamilton moving in the opposite direction. </p> <p><strong> Charlton</strong><br> </p> <p>Peter Varney says Charlton are failing to sign players because rival clubs are asking 'crazy' transfer fees. 'It's common knowledge that Charlton have money to spend,' says Varney. 'When everyone knows how much, they ask for crazy money.' </p> <p><strong> Chelsea</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Mario Stanic </strong> says he'll be winning medals at Chelsea next season. 'I've won the Super Cup, Uefa Cup and Italian Cup, but I will win more here.' Mikael Forsell, meanwhile, will choose between <strong> Bolton </strong> and <strong> Palace </strong> when he returns from holiday. </p> <p><strong> Coventry</strong><br> </p> <p>Coventry are chasing Don Hutchison and Niclas Alexandersson. 'I think we have a chance of signing them,' says Bryan Richardson. 'Certainly over the next 14 days we will start to seem some changes.' </p> <p><strong> Derby</strong><br> </p> <p>Man Utd have refused to sell <strong>Dan Higginbotham</strong>. Jim Smith lodged a \u00a31.5m bid last week, but United want to keep their left-sided options open. </p> <p><strong> Everton</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> John Collins </strong> will join <strong> Fulham </strong> this week - he'll be replaced by <strong> Tranmere's </strong> Alan Mahon. Alessandro Pistone, meanwhile, is still surprised by his move to Goodison: 'I had my ups and downs at Newcastle but I'm still surprised they sold me.' </p> <p><strong> Ipswich</strong><br> </p> <p>Ipswich look to have beaten <strong> Everton </strong> and <strong> Wimbledon </strong> to the signing of John Scales; George Burley also wants <strong> Hibs' </strong> \u00a32m-rated midfielder Russell Latapy. </p> <p><strong> Leeds</strong><br> </p> <p>Peter Ridsdale has ruled out a big money bid for <strong> West Ham's </strong> Rio Ferdinand - but could sanction the sale of David Hopkin to <strong> Bradford </strong> or <strong> Man City </strong> this week. </p> <p><strong> Leicester</strong><br> </p> <p>Peter Taylor wants two new goalkeepers to back-up Tim Flowers - and is set to bid for <strong> Everton's </strong> Michael Ball. 'I rate Michael and I have enquired about him,' says Taylor. 'But there are others I have also asked about.' </p> <p><strong> Liverpool</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Nick Barmby's </strong> demand to join Liverpool has infuriated <strong> Everton </strong> boss Walter Smith. 'They've made an inquiry and he wants to go. It has become an impossible situation.' <strong> Sunderland</strong> ,<strong> </strong> meanwhile, have denied bidding for David Thompson. </p> <p><strong> Manchester City</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Stoke's </strong> John Rudge has denied that Peter Thorne is set to sign for City: 'It's just rumours.' Joe Royle is likely to move for <strong> Coventry's </strong> Noel Whelan instead. </p> <p><strong> Manchester United</strong><br> </p> <p>Martin Edwards has denied a bid for <strong> Lazio's </strong> Pavel Nedved: 'We haven't bid for him - we haven't even discussed him.' A move for <strong> River Plate's </strong> Juan Pablo Sorin is, though, on the cards: Alex Ferguson wants the 24-year-old left-back to replace Dennis Irwin. He could also bid for <strong> Peterborough </strong> starlet Adam Drury. </p> <p><strong> Middlesbrough</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Chris Sutton </strong> will choose this week between <strong> Middlesbrough </strong> and <strong> Celtic</strong> . 'Chris isn't swinging towards anyone just yet,' says agent John Viola. 'We'll speak to both'. If Sutton signs, it'll mean the end for Brian Deane - <strong> Blackburn </strong> are keen. </p> <p><strong> Newcastle</strong><br> </p> <p>Bobby Robson is set to complete a shock \u00a38m swoop for Belgian striker Emile Mpenza. Robson has already talked down <strong> FC Schalke's </strong> \u00a312m asking price, and will meet Mpenza this week to discuss terms. He could also be tempted by <strong> Barcelona's </strong> decision to sell<strong> </strong> \u00a33.9m-rated Spain captain Josep Guardiola. </p> <p><strong> Southampton</strong><br> </p> <p> Glenn Hoddle will complete his \u00a31.5m move for Mark Draper this week, but looks to have missed out on <strong> Tottenham's </strong> Ipswich-bound defender John Scales. </p> <p><strong> Sunderland</strong><br> </p> <p>Peter Reid is closing on <strong> Mechelen's </strong> Tom Peeters: 'He's a player I like the look of,' says Reid. 'I've made an inquiry and we'll see what happens.' Reid is also 'still hopeful' of landing key target Radek Bejbl, and expects developments this week. </p> <p><strong> Tottenham</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Neale Fenn </strong> should join <strong> Brentford </strong> for \u00a3350,000 tomorrow - 'I've become very stale in the reserves', says Fenn. 'At my age I need regular first team football.' David Ginola's move to <strong> Villa </strong> is in doubt - negotiations over personal terms are stalling. </p> <p><strong> West Ham</strong><br> </p> <p> Harry Redknapp wants <strong> Man United </strong> flop Jordi Cruyff. 'I think Cruyff's a good free transfer,' says Redknapp. 'We're looking to make room for him by shifting one or two players. If I make the space, he's definitely one I'd like.'</p>",

      "bodyText": "FERGIE: YOU WON'T CATCH US Alex Ferguson has told Premiership rivals: You could spend \u00a3100 million and you still won't catch us. 'This team is capable of holding its own momentum,' says Fergie, 'regardless of what others are doing.' WENGER EYES UP ZIDANE Arsene Wenger says he wants Zinedine Zidane - but not for \u00a340m. 'I would love to have him here at Highbury but it is not possible. He's the best in the world in his position: in today's market he'd be worth \u00a340m.' O'LEARY IN \u00a310M EHIOGU SWOOP David O'Leary has agreed a \u00a310m Leeds package to rescue unsettled Ugo Ehigou from Aston Villa: he'll offer \u00a35m cash plus Michael Duberry. Arsenal Arsenal are new favourites to land Nuno Gomes. 'We don't intend to sell him,' says Benfica's Joao Vale e Azevedo, 'but we couldn't refuse an extraordinary offer.' Arsene Wenger is also watching Deportivo star Flavio da Conceicao as a replacement for Marc Overmars, plus Brazilian duo Edu and Edmilson. 'We might take a gamble on them,' says Wenger, 'but it is far from done.' Aston Villa John Gregory will be \u00a34m up by the end of the week - Steve Watson is off to Everton for \u00a32m and Mark Draper will sign for Southampton for \u00a31.5m. Benito Carbone could also go: he's officially a free agent as of last night. Bradford Geoffrey Richmond says Newcastle have no chance of signing keeper Matt Clarke - but Clarke isn't so sure. 'I know they're interested,' he says, 'and they're a big club.' The deal would mean Des Hamilton moving in the opposite direction. Charlton Peter Varney says Charlton are failing to sign players because rival clubs are asking 'crazy' transfer fees. 'It's common knowledge that Charlton have money to spend,' says Varney. 'When everyone knows how much, they ask for crazy money.' Chelsea Mario Stanic says he'll be winning medals at Chelsea next season. 'I've won the Super Cup, Uefa Cup and Italian Cup, but I will win more here.' Mikael Forsell, meanwhile, will choose between Bolton and Palace when he returns from holiday. Coventry Coventry are chasing Don Hutchison and Niclas Alexandersson. 'I think we have a chance of signing them,' says Bryan Richardson. 'Certainly over the next 14 days we will start to seem some changes.' Derby Man Utd have refused to sell Dan Higginbotham. Jim Smith lodged a \u00a31.5m bid last week, but United want to keep their left-sided options open. Everton John Collins will join Fulham this week - he'll be replaced by Tranmere's Alan Mahon. Alessandro Pistone, meanwhile, is still surprised by his move to Goodison: 'I had my ups and downs at Newcastle but I'm still surprised they sold me.' Ipswich Ipswich look to have beaten Everton and Wimbledon to the signing of John Scales; George Burley also wants Hibs' \u00a32m-rated midfielder Russell Latapy. Leeds Peter Ridsdale has ruled out a big money bid for West Ham's Rio Ferdinand - but could sanction the sale of David Hopkin to Bradford or Man City this week. Leicester Peter Taylor wants two new goalkeepers to back-up Tim Flowers - and is set to bid for Everton's Michael Ball. 'I rate Michael and I have enquired about him,' says Taylor. 'But there are others I have also asked about.' Liverpool Nick Barmby's demand to join Liverpool has infuriated Everton boss Walter Smith. 'They've made an inquiry and he wants to go. It has become an impossible situation.' Sunderland , meanwhile, have denied bidding for David Thompson. Manchester City Stoke's John Rudge has denied that Peter Thorne is set to sign for City: 'It's just rumours.' Joe Royle is likely to move for Coventry's Noel Whelan instead. Manchester United Martin Edwards has denied a bid for Lazio's Pavel Nedved: 'We haven't bid for him - we haven't even discussed him.' A move for River Plate's Juan Pablo Sorin is, though, on the cards: Alex Ferguson wants the 24-year-old left-back to replace Dennis Irwin. He could also bid for Peterborough starlet Adam Drury. Middlesbrough Chris Sutton will choose this week between Middlesbrough and Celtic . 'Chris isn't swinging towards anyone just yet,' says agent John Viola. 'We'll speak to both'. If Sutton signs, it'll mean the end for Brian Deane - Blackburn are keen. Newcastle Bobby Robson is set to complete a shock \u00a38m swoop for Belgian striker Emile Mpenza. Robson has already talked down FC Schalke's \u00a312m asking price, and will meet Mpenza this week to discuss terms. He could also be tempted by Barcelona's decision to sell \u00a33.9m-rated Spain captain Josep Guardiola. Southampton Glenn Hoddle will complete his \u00a31.5m move for Mark Draper this week, but looks to have missed out on Tottenham's Ipswich-bound defender John Scales. Sunderland Peter Reid is closing on Mechelen's Tom Peeters: 'He's a player I like the look of,' says Reid. 'I've made an inquiry and we'll see what happens.' Reid is also 'still hopeful' of landing key target Radek Bejbl, and expects developments this week. Tottenham Neale Fenn should join Brentford for \u00a3350,000 tomorrow - 'I've become very stale in the reserves', says Fenn. 'At my age I need regular first team football.' David Ginola's move to Villa is in doubt - negotiations over personal terms are stalling. West Ham Harry Redknapp wants Man United flop Jordi Cruyff. 'I think Cruyff's a good free transfer,' says Redknapp. 'We're looking to make room for him by shifting one or two players. If I make the space, he's definitely one I'd like.'",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>These three footballers could only have come from Italy. Alessandro Nesta, Fabio Cannavaro and Francesco Toldo look, think and play quite unlike inhabitants of any other nation. </p> <p>Toldo was born first, 28 years ago in Padova, the son of a tobacconist. On Thursday, more than 20 people gathered in the family shop to watch the semi-final against Holland on television. They knew their boy should not have been playing. Francesco Toldo was Italy's reserve keeper until Gianluca Buffon broke a hand in Oslo shortly before Euro 2000. </p> <p>Cannavaro was born in Naples 26 years ago, the son of a semi-professional footballer. From an early age he cultivated an Italian ambition: he wanted to be a defender. Cannavaro has a faint contempt for attackers. They can mess around with the ball, even lose it. </p> <p>Cannavaro found a role model in another Neapolitan defender, Ciro Ferrara, who is 33 and sits on Italy's bench. 'He was and is my example,' says Cannavaro. </p> <p>Had Cannavaro been born in England, he would probably never have found employment as a centre-back: he is only 5ft 9in. To compensate, he has built up his upper body and arms. A defender needs his arms, says Cannavaro says, because he has to be always touching his striker, checking where he is. Cannavaro loves these details. He defends by vocation. The most enjoyable thing in football, he says, is marking: 'Marcare, marcare, marcare!' He is a happy man, the only Italian player who is cheerful in defeat. </p> <p>The man-marker is a peculiarly Italian profession, like gondolier or fashion designer. The post has a long, if not always honourable, history, encompassing legends like Oriali, Bergomi, Collovati and the filthy Claudio Gentile. They would sing in the shower if they shut a striker out of the match, even if their team had lost. They form the stock of role models. </p> <p>Alessandro Nesta was born 24 years ago in Rome. He grew up in Cinecitta, the film studio suburb, son of a station guard and Lazio supporter named Giuseppe. Aged ten, Alessandro joined Lazio. 'I felt immediately this was a great talent,' says Felice Pulici, who spotted him. 'The way he ran, with his back straight. And a natural gift of playing the ball simply.' </p> <p>Nesta made his debut at 17, under Dino Zoff, now Italy's coach. As Lazio trained a few weeks later, he saw Paul Gascoigne flying towards him like a fat UFO. Nesta held his leg firm, and unintentionally broke Gascoigne's. On realising this, he cried. </p> <p>But he progressed. He acquired his lucky shirt number, 13 (Italians think 17 is the unlucky number) and just before Euro 96, helped Italy win the European Under-21 Championship. He was voted player of the tournament. </p> <p>Aged 21, he made his debut for Italy. A year later, while sidelined with torn knee ligaments, his team-mates voted him club captain. Today he also sits on the Lazio board. Playing alongside Sinisa Mihajlovic, who is cranked into life only for free-kicks, he acts as libero and stopper at once. He senses gaps before they appear. 'He's a good one,' says Marco van Basten in the Dutch magazine Hard Gras . </p> <p>So gracefully does the Roman move that he is sometimes compared to the great Italian libero Franco Baresi. But Nesta, though a better defender, lacks Baresi's creativity. In 139 league games for Lazio he has scored only once. Nor does he talk much. But after Lazio pipped Juventus to the Italian title last season, he led his home crowd in a rendition of ' Juve, Juve, vaffanculo! ' This is best not translated. </p> <p>Italy have fielded their first-choice defence in four matches at Euro 2000 (against Sweden, the second team played). In those four matches they have conceded one goal, against Turkey, and that caused national anguish. </p> <p>Cannavaro, asked to name the best defenders at Euro 2000, replies: 'After myself and Nesta, I think the Frenchman Thuram.' </p> <p>So dominant have Nesta and Cannavaro been that the Italian fans have copied their hairbands. That is part of a trend of this month: the glorification of defending. Suddenly, it seems, kids no longer want to be Beckham or Alessandro del Piero, but Cannavaro. The new cult, incidentally, will only make Toldo, Nesta and Cannavaro more fearsome. With keepers and defenders, as with fast bowlers, the aura helps. </p> <p>The way the Italians do it, defending is indeed glorious_'the most important thing in football,' says Cannavaro. And it is beautiful: Cannavaro and Nesta are girls' idols. Contrast these two with, say, Martin Keown and Sol Campbell. The two Italians are more mobile, partly thanks to club gymnastics exercises, and partly because they were chosen for mobility. They stay upright, never lunge: their team-mate, Mark Iuliano, conceded a penalty on Thursday with a horizontal sliding tackle on Edgar Davids that was worthy of an English defender. Nesta and Cannavaro rarely even foul. 'It's marvellous to play a forward out of a match without using rough methods,' says Nesta. 'That gives me the ultimate kick.' </p> <p>On Thursday Nesta did concede a penalty, pulling at Patrick Kluivert's shirt, but otherwise eliminated the Dutch forward in the prescribed manner. Cannavaro at once shadowed Kluivert, Dennis Bergkamp, and, after Italy were reduced to 10 men, Boudewijn Zenden. Colleagues Paolo Maldini and Iuliano were both occasionally beaten but it is impossible to remember Cannavaro being beaten once. </p> <p>He also delighted in throwing himself in front of Dutch shots, so that Toldo had little to do given that his team spent 120 minutes defending. 'The Dutch could have played for 24 hours and they would not have been able to score,' Toldo said afterwards. It was an understatement. </p> <p>On Thursday the keeper stopped three penalties. He said later that he had discussed penalty psychology with Del Piero, Italy's leading penalty expert. 'It's a subtle game of glances and feeling,' was all Toldo would reveal. His technique certainly involves staring at the penalty-taker. The watching Pele was seen gesturing at Toldo, gesturing at his own eye, and laughing. </p> <p>Afterwards Zoff was asked: 'What do you say to a keeper who saves three penalties for you?' </p> <p>'Thank you,' said Zoff. </p> <p>After the Dutch match, the Italian newspaper La Gazzetta dello Sport awarded Cannavaro nine marks out of 10. La Stampa gave Toldo a straight 10. Such marks are unheard of. And Italy has seen good defenders before.</p>",

Had Cannavaro been born in England, he would probably never have found employment as a centre-back: he is only 5ft 9in. To compensate, he has built up his upper body and arms. A defender needs his arms, says Cannavaro says, because he has to be always touching his striker, checking where he is. Cannavaro loves these details. He defends by vocation. The most enjoyable thing in football, he says, is marking: 'Marcare, marcare, marcare!' He is a happy man, the only Italian player who is cheerful in defeat. The man-marker is a peculiarly Italian profession, like gondolier or fashion designer. The post has a long, if not always honourable, history, encompassing legends like Oriali, Bergomi, Collovati and the filthy Claudio Gentile. They would sing in the shower if they shut a striker out of the match, even if their team had lost. They form the stock of role models. Alessandro Nesta was born 24 years ago in Rome. He grew up in Cinecitta, the film studio suburb, son of a station guard and Lazio supporter named Giuseppe. Aged ten, Alessandro joined Lazio. 'I felt immediately this was a great talent,' says Felice Pulici, who spotted him. 'The way he ran, with his back straight. And a natural gift of playing the ball simply.' Nesta made his debut at 17, under Dino Zoff, now Italy's coach. As Lazio trained a few weeks later, he saw Paul Gascoigne flying towards him like a fat UFO. Nesta held his leg firm, and unintentionally broke Gascoigne's. On realising this, he cried. But he progressed. He acquired his lucky shirt number, 13 (Italians think 17 is the unlucky number) and just before Euro 96, helped Italy win the European Under-21 Championship. He was voted player of the tournament. Aged 21, he made his debut for Italy. A year later, while sidelined with torn knee ligaments, his team-mates voted him club captain. Today he also sits on the Lazio board. Playing alongside Sinisa Mihajlovic, who is cranked into life only for free-kicks, he acts as libero and stopper at once. He senses gaps before they appear. 'He's a good one,' says Marco van Basten in the Dutch magazine Hard Gras . So gracefully does the Roman move that he is sometimes compared to the great Italian libero Franco Baresi. But Nesta, though a better defender, lacks Baresi's creativity. In 139 league games for Lazio he has scored only once. Nor does he talk much. But after Lazio pipped Juventus to the Italian title last season, he led his home crowd in a rendition of ' Juve, Juve, vaffanculo! ' This is best not translated. Italy have fielded their first-choice defence in four matches at Euro 2000 (against Sweden, the second team played). In those four matches they have conceded one goal, against Turkey, and that caused national anguish. Cannavaro, asked to name the best defenders at Euro 2000, replies: 'After myself and Nesta, I think the Frenchman Thuram.' So dominant have Nesta and Cannavaro been that the Italian fans have copied their hairbands. That is part of a trend of this month: the glorification of defending. Suddenly, it seems, kids no longer want to be Beckham or Alessandro del Piero, but Cannavaro. The new cult, incidentally, will only make Toldo, Nesta and Cannavaro more fearsome. With keepers and defenders, as with fast bowlers, the aura helps. The way the Italians do it, defending is indeed glorious_'the most important thing in football,' says Cannavaro. And it is beautiful: Cannavaro and Nesta are girls' idols. Contrast these two with, say, Martin Keown and Sol Campbell. The two Italians are more mobile, partly thanks to club gymnastics exercises, and partly because they were chosen for mobility. They stay upright, never lunge: their team-mate, Mark Iuliano, conceded a penalty on Thursday with a horizontal sliding tackle on Edgar Davids that was worthy of an English defender. Nesta and Cannavaro rarely even foul. 'It's marvellous to play a forward out of a match without using rough methods,' says Nesta. 'That gives me the ultimate kick.' On Thursday Nesta did concede a penalty, pulling at Patrick Kluivert's shirt, but otherwise eliminated the Dutch forward in the prescribed manner. Cannavaro at once shadowed Kluivert, Dennis Bergkamp, and, after Italy were reduced to 10 men, Boudewijn Zenden. Colleagues Paolo Maldini and Iuliano were both occasionally beaten but it is impossible to remember Cannavaro being beaten once. He also delighted in throwing himself in front of Dutch shots, so that Toldo had little to do given that his team spent 120 minutes defending. 'The Dutch could have played for 24 hours and they would not have been able to score,' Toldo said afterwards. It was an understatement. On Thursday the keeper stopped three penalties. He said later that he had discussed penalty psychology with Del Piero, Italy's leading penalty expert. 'It's a subtle game of glances and feeling,' was all Toldo would reveal. His technique certainly involves staring at the penalty-taker. The watching Pele was seen gesturing at Toldo, gesturing at his own eye, and laughing. Afterwards Zoff was asked: 'What do you say to a keeper who saves three penalties for you?' 'Thank you,' said Zoff. After the Dutch match, the Italian newspaper La Gazzetta dello Sport awarded Cannavaro nine marks out of 10. La Stampa gave Toldo a straight 10. Such marks are unheard of. And Italy has seen good defenders before.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>There is a reason Zinedine Zidane suffers from premature baldness. Genius footballer, generous nature, gentle man, his maker must have thought it only fair to show some evidence of imperfection. </p> <p>Over the past month no other player from a catchment area that embraces an entire continent has captured the imagination quite like Zidane. He is mesmeric. Watching him dance over the grass leaving a flurry of opponents in his wake has been, in the words of the man from L'Equipe , like falling in love. Nobody says it quite like the French. </p> <p>And at the moment, in footballing terms, nobody does it quite like the French. They are a more majestic sight now than when they won the World Cup, and the most important reason for this improvement is that their maestro, Zidane, is playing out of his skin. </p> <p>Already a member of the pantheon of European masters tonight he is on the brink of something unique. On his day his technical gifts bear comparison with Cruyff, Van Basten, Gullit, Platini - but none of them claimed both World and European titles. What of Matth\u00e4us or Klinsmann, who own both those medals at home? Ask a hundred football connoisseurs who they would rather pay to watch: Matth\u00e4us, Klinsmann or Zidane. </p> <p>If France overcome Italy in the Euro 2000 final Zidane will have both the box-office appeal and the Oscars. Adoration and achievements in equal measure. </p> <p>He says he feels at the top of his form. His manager Roger Lemerre is not the only expert to believe he is the best footballer on the planet. The demise of Ronaldo eliminates his nearest competitor. A few months ago, when the Brazilian was in Paris for an operation and Zidane was over for a publicity shoot for Lego, he went to the hospital to visit the player whose star began to fall at the precise moment Zidane's soared upwards. The French are proud of Zidane because he is a good man as well as a great player. Always has been. Fame has changed his life but not him. Back home he is so well known and liked by virtually his entire nation that everybody - from manager, team-mates and supporters right through to the President of the Republic - uses his nickname, Zizou. </p> <p>Of Algerian stock, Zidane hails from a poor quarter of Marseilles. His parents sacrificed his father Smail's meagre wage to buy him boots and gave him an unbringing he described as 'hard but fair, which taught me respect, humility, sharing'. He perfected his mellifluous style in the streets: flowerpots for goalposts, a plastic bottle for a trophy, he played endlessly with his friends. </p> <p>As a boy he went to watch Olympique Marseille with his father and three brothers on the Curve Nord - the only place to be for OM fans from his side of town - and Enzo Francescoli was his hero. He named his first son Enzo. </p> <p>He clings to his roots, and his roots cling to him. During the World Cup a smouldering portrait of their very own Zizou was blown up to cover the wall of an entire building on the Corniche overlooking the Mediterranean. </p> <p>His first club was Cannes, an hour's drive along the Riviera coast road. They spotted him at 13 and invited him to join their academy, a successful school which also produced Johan Micoud and Patrick Vieira. By 16 he was in the first team (staggered to pocket \u00a3500 per match, which he handed over to his parents, of course). At 20 he was gone, to Bordeaux, where he began to mature under the paternal tutelage of coach Rolland Courbis, another Marseillais. 'My fame,' notes Zidane, 'was born there. I was transformed.' </p> <p>What fun was had at Bordeaux, where Zidane struck up an instant bond with the team-mate who became his best friend, the more extrovert Christophe Dugarry. They get along because, although they are different personalities, they are both emotional and sensitive. Together with Bixente Lizarazu, they inspired their homely club to legendary feats. None of them will ever forget a European odyssey which began with the Intertoto Cup and ended with a Uefa Cup final. Zidane was making waves. Juventus paid \u00a33.5 million to whisk him to Serie A . Comparisons with Platini were increasingly frequent. 'It's too heavy a heritage to carry,' he countered back then. 'I am Zinedine Zidane and people have to understand I will never be Michel Platini. I am not a leader of men and I never will be.' He used to be, to borrow a French phrase, a b\u00e9ni-oui- oui, someone whose shyness means it's easier to be monosyllabic and say yes, yes all the time. </p> <p> Nowadays you might spot him shouting at Deschamps or Djorkaeff for a misplaced pass. He has even publicly disagreed with one or two of Lemerre's tactical decisions. At 28 and at his peak he is more comfortable as a leader. He has learned to accept it and can express himself more freely. In his own subtle way he has become a driving force. His rapport with the younger players in the squad is developing all the time. </p> <p>Those who persist in making comparisons between him and Platini point to one fundamental difference. Zidane is not a prolific goalscorer (15 in 56 games, as opposed to Platini's 41 in 72). His critics suggest a player with such elevated status should have been able to make the difference for Juventus when they inexplicably squandered this season's title. </p> <p>In his defence, one of the reasons he does not score so regularly is that he has such an extraordinary talent for creating goals for others. In Euro 2000 he has made more of those devastating slalom dribbles than Marc Overmars and more decisive crosses than Luis Figo. Besides, as Lemerre points out, his game is still evolving: 'There is so much more to come from Zidane. He can improve still further. He's phenomenal, on his way to becoming a monument of French football like Platini or Kopa.' </p> <p>The affiliation between Platini and Zidane goes back to the moment Zizou celebrated his 12th birthday with the honour of being ballboy at the V\u00e9lodrome when France met Portugal in the 1984 European Championship. He was watching his country in the flesh for the first time, enchanted as Platini plundered a dramatic winner to take France to the final. Fourteen years on the roles were reversed. Platini was on the sidelines, captivated by the sight of the rightful successor to his distinguished No 10 shirt scoring to win the World Cup. </p> <p> Goals might be the one string to Zidane's bow which could do with fine tuning (although his return of two, at key moments, during Euro 2000 is not bad). Otherwise he has never played so well. Tournament by international tournament he has raised the standards and so have France. Zidane's first cap came as Les Bleus were restructuring after a kamikaze failure to qualify for USA 94. By the time Euro 96 came around he was already billed as the fulcrum. But he arrived in England tired and sore, having played more than 60 games and torn a muscle in a car accident. Neither he nor his team made the heart soar. </p> <p>Memories of France 98 will be forever intertwined with Zizou's two fine headed goals against Brazil. Victory was everything, but the competition wasn't a free-flowing breeze for team or talisman. People forget their hero was sent off for stamping on a Saudi Arabian and forced to miss two games. Without him, France disposed of South Africa but could only squeeze past Paraguay with a golden goal. </p> <p>He returned to face Italy in the quarter-final, and at a critical time manager Aime Jacquet gave him a crucial pep talk. 'Zizou, the French team is not you, and you don't represent the French team. Think hard about those words,' he warned, before adding, poignantly, 'But it's you who can make us win.' </p> <p>In Euro 2000 France, and their conductor, have reached a higher plane. Compared to the World Cup there is more poetry in his performances. More absolute control. More of those tricks where he rolls his studs over the ball to keep possession. He is hard to dispossess not because of body strength, but crafty close control. It's like moving a ball of wool an inch to the left and watching a kitten paw at the vacated space. The manager who took him to Juventus, Marcello Lippi, described it as his skill for making complicated things easy. </p> <p>But the point about Zidane's brilliance is, not only is he a joy to the eye, he is also ruthlessly efficient. Lemerre no doubt likes to see him wow the crowd with a clever turn, but he loves to see him slice open the opposition's defence with a devastating pinpoint pass. </p> <p>If Italy have the legs to continue damming more fluid opponents with their wall of resistance Zidane will be the man expected to fashion the breakthrough. Playing regularly in Serie A means he is not overawed by the smothering cloak of an Italian defence. Psychologically, he knows he can rise above that and impose his skills. He is particularly pleased it is Dino Zoff's prudent team who stand between him and his country's double dream. </p> <p>France are 90 minutes (please no more unbearable golden goals or penalty shoot-outs) from sporting immortality. This would make them not just a great French side, or a great modern side, but one of the great football teams of all time, inspired by one of the great players. Over to you, Zizou.</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Holland are famous for never winning a World Cup but crediting themselves with a couple of moral victories for playing the best football. They are entitled to look back on Euro 2000 in the same way. The tournament will no longer end in a giant orange party, but, largely thanks to the hosts, it deserves to be remembered as one of the great football-fests. Even France's Emmanuel Petit has said: 'This tournament is stronger than the World Cup two years ago.' </p> <p>Images of Italy prevailing in the orangeness of the Amsterdam ArenA, of Portugal's despair at that golden-goal penalty, and of Zinedine Zidane transcending anything seen in Europe since Johan Cruyff will linger long in the memory. There were good teams, there were bad teams, but there were very few bad games. </p> <p>Even the occasional stinker like England v Germany was only depressing for its poverty of talent and imagination, and not for the petty indiscipline and mean-spirited negativity which disfigured earlier tournaments. Euro 2000 was confirmation that rule changes have got the game into good shape for the next century. There were heroes aplenty, from Zidane to Zlatko Zahovic, and no real villains. And that includes Italy. </p> <p>There can be little doubt that Holland were the true hosts. The Belgians have never added much to the gaiety of nations, and here both their fans and their football were flat, functional and quickly forgotten. Dutch fans and players, on the other hand, seemed to be competing with each other in a friendly fight to see who could be the more vibrant. In the final analysis, given that Rotterdam this evening is still likely to be a fairly orange experience even though the dream ending has been shattered by Italian reality, the fans probably won. </p> <p>It was certainly revealing to be in the Grand Place in Brussels, the square which earlier in the tournament had witnessed the water cannon versus En-ger-land contest, on the day of the Portugal-France semi-final. Portuguese fans, wandering the streets in flags and face paint, were slightly outnumbered by French supporters who had noisily taken over a few bars and pavement cafes. By far the biggest presence, however, was that of the Dutch in their regulation orange. </p> <p>'I am sorry, I am embarrassed to be Dutch,' an Amsterdam waitress whispered as a battered orange bus full of supporters in matching orange bowler hats brought traffic to a standstill outside her cafe before the second semi-final. At that point it was rather more acutely embarrassing to be English. Just as a German banner at the France-Portugal match had pointedly alerted the German FA to the fact that this was how football should be played, the boisterous but never less than courteous Dutch could be held up as an example to the obnoxious element among England followers. 'That,' the message might read, 'is how you support a national team.' </p> <p>There are those who will claim it is a pity such colourful and committed support did not get the final it deserved, or, more contentiously, that Holland's positive attacking play was effectively mugged by football's dark forces in the Amsterdam ArenA. But this simply will not do. Complaining of cynicism in Italian defending is like objecting to the heat in the Tropics. Rules have been re-framed over the last decade to discourage teams from skulking in their own half and stifling play, but Italy were severely penalised against Holland for the bits of their game which were unduly uncompromising. </p> <p>They effectively had to play 90 minutes with 10 men and conceded two penalties in normal time. One cannot advance a moral case for a team which managed to miss five penalties in a semi-final, and neither can one dismiss Italy as anti-football when they defended an adverse situation so heroically. Despite Italy's numerical disad vantage they actually had three attacking forwards on the field late in the game in Alessandro Del Piero, Marco Delvecchio and Francesco Totti, so it is hardly even the case that they simply got men behind the ball. </p> <p>Dino Zoff's side may not win many friends playing like that, but very few defences could surrender so much possession and territory and still prevent a goal. The idea that every team should play fantasy football is just that, fantasy. </p> <p>You can only measure the brilliance of attacking sides like France and Brazil against teams who don't give away goals for the asking. Holland 6 Yugoslavia 1 was entertaining, but Italy 0 Holland 0 was instructive. Football needs its light and dark, chiaroscuro as they call it in the country which gave us catenaccio . It will be interesting, to say the least, so see whether France's attacking reputation emerges intact after today's final. </p> <p>One goal is all it might take to undo Italy, and Holland were unlucky to the extent that Dennis Bergkamp hit a post early in the game and Francesco Toldo made a couple of vital stops, but by the end, hindered in no small way by Frank Rijkaard's mystifying substitutions, the clockwork orange machine had wound down to the extent that it was harmlessly spinning in ever-decreasing circles. </p> <p>So if France prevail it will be a victory for attacking football but if the game goes Italy's way, it will still be a victory for football. France v Holland would inevitably have been a disappointment anyway, just as France v Portugal did not produce the feast everyone was expecting. It is also worth asking whether Holland were ever all they were cracked up to be, since their most impressive performances in this tournament were against a weak Danish side, a France B team and a shambles from Yugoslavia. Against a full-strength and capable Czech team they needed a lucky late goal to secure victory, and against resolute Italy they ran out of ideas. </p> <p>France should do better, even if their own semi-final suggested they might struggle against an organised defence. Their key advantages are pace and movement, and the player to push open the door is Zidane. If he takes the ball standing still, as he did too often against Portugal, he will impress with his balance and close control but ultimately play into Italy's hands.

It could be argued the competition was devoid of drama or upset in its early stages, with no real shocks in the group stage and every quarter-final going to form, but the two semi-finals certainly corrected that impression.

No wonder Uefa are considering scrapping the golden-goal period already. It did not seem possible the Amsterdam semi could rival the Brussels one, but it did, and it produced an upset into the bargain.

Boorish English behaviour does not begin on the cross-channel ferry or at the commencement of a football tournament. Its existence and tolerance at home is the unwritten story every time the government or Uefa wring their hands over the latest shaming example of non-assimilation with more civilised cultures.

      "bodyText": "Holland are famous for never winning a World Cup but crediting themselves with a couple of moral victories for playing the best football. They are entitled to look back on Euro 2000 in the same way. The tournament will no longer end in a giant orange party, but, largely thanks to the hosts, it deserves to be remembered as one of the great football-fests. Even France's Emmanuel Petit has said: 'This tournament is stronger than the World Cup two years ago.' Images of Italy prevailing in the orangeness of the Amsterdam ArenA, of Portugal's despair at that golden-goal penalty, and of Zinedine Zidane transcending anything seen in Europe since Johan Cruyff will linger long in the memory. There were good teams, there were bad teams, but there were very few bad games. Even the occasional stinker like England v Germany was only depressing for its poverty of talent and imagination, and not for the petty indiscipline and mean-spirited negativity which disfigured earlier tournaments. Euro 2000 was confirmation that rule changes have got the game into good shape for the next century. There were heroes aplenty, from Zidane to Zlatko Zahovic, and no real villains. And that includes Italy. There can be little doubt that Holland were the true hosts. The Belgians have never added much to the gaiety of nations, and here both their fans and their football were flat, functional and quickly forgotten. Dutch fans and players, on the other hand, seemed to be competing with each other in a friendly fight to see who could be the more vibrant. In the final analysis, given that Rotterdam this evening is still likely to be a fairly orange experience even though the dream ending has been shattered by Italian reality, the fans probably won. It was certainly revealing to be in the Grand Place in Brussels, the square which earlier in the tournament had witnessed the water cannon versus En-ger-land contest, on the day of the Portugal-France semi-final. Portuguese fans, wandering the streets in flags and face paint, were slightly outnumbered by French supporters who had noisily taken over a few bars and pavement cafes. By far the biggest presence, however, was that of the Dutch in their regulation orange. 'I am sorry, I am embarrassed to be Dutch,' an Amsterdam waitress whispered as a battered orange bus full of supporters in matching orange bowler hats brought traffic to a standstill outside her cafe before the second semi-final. At that point it was rather more acutely embarrassing to be English. Just as a German banner at the France-Portugal match had pointedly alerted the German FA to the fact that this was how football should be played, the boisterous but never less than courteous Dutch could be held up as an example to the obnoxious element among England followers. 'That,' the message might read, 'is how you support a national team.' There are those who will claim it is a pity such colourful and committed support did not get the final it deserved, or, more contentiously, that Holland's positive attacking play was effectively mugged by football's dark forces in the Amsterdam ArenA. But this simply will not do. Complaining of cynicism in Italian defending is like objecting to the heat in the Tropics. Rules have been re-framed over the last decade to discourage teams from skulking in their own half and stifling play, but Italy were severely penalised against Holland for the bits of their game which were unduly uncompromising. They effectively had to play 90 minutes with 10 men and conceded two penalties in normal time. One cannot advance a moral case for a team which managed to miss five penalties in a semi-final, and neither can one dismiss Italy as anti-football when they defended an adverse situation so heroically. Despite Italy's numerical disad vantage they actually had three attacking forwards on the field late in the game in Alessandro Del Piero, Marco Delvecchio and Francesco Totti, so it is hardly even the case that they simply got men behind the ball. Dino Zoff's side may not win many friends playing like that, but very few defences could surrender so much possession and territory and still prevent a goal. The idea that every team should play fantasy football is just that, fantasy. You can only measure the brilliance of attacking sides like France and Brazil against teams who don't give away goals for the asking. Holland 6 Yugoslavia 1 was entertaining, but Italy 0 Holland 0 was instructive. Football needs its light and dark, chiaroscuro as they call it in the country which gave us catenaccio . It will be interesting, to say the least, so see whether France's attacking reputation emerges intact after today's final. One goal is all it might take to undo Italy, and Holland were unlucky to the extent that Dennis Bergkamp hit a post early in the game and Francesco Toldo made a couple of vital stops, but by the end, hindered in no small way by Frank Rijkaard's mystifying substitutions, the clockwork orange machine had wound down to the extent that it was harmlessly spinning in ever-decreasing circles. So if France prevail it will be a victory for attacking football but if the game goes Italy's way, it will still be a victory for football. France v Holland would inevitably have been a disappointment anyway, just as France v Portugal did not produce the feast everyone was expecting. It is also worth asking whether Holland were ever all they were cracked up to be, since their most impressive performances in this tournament were against a weak Danish side, a France B team and a shambles from Yugoslavia. Against a full-strength and capable Czech team they needed a lucky late goal to secure victory, and against resolute Italy they ran out of ideas. France should do better, even if their own semi-final suggested they might struggle against an organised defence. Their key advantages are pace and movement, and the player to push open the door is Zidane. If he takes the ball standing still, as he did too often against Portugal, he will impress with his balance and close control but ultimately play into Italy's hands. If he can take the ball at pace, forcing defenders to commit themselves and using his sublime distribution to get France on the move, the favourites should prosper. Either way, one hopes the tournament breaks a recent sequence and gets the final it deserves, since there is no doubt it has been the most enjoyable, skilful and memorable meeting of nations since the early Seventies. Here are a few reasons why. FOOTBALL Not quite Brazil in 1970 perhaps, but some truly fabulous passing, movement and finishing from those such as Portugal, France, Spain and Holland.

Within five seconds, the French send their first long ball to Thierry Henry. Within thirty seconds, the second long ball sets Henry free. He dumps Fabio Cannavaro and chips a low ball to the far post where Maldini beats Zidane to the ball.</p> <p><strong>2</strong> Italy try to get a little snow on it too, and Marco Delvecchio nearly profits before an onrushing Barthez intercepts.</p> <p><strong>4</strong> Italian corner, conceded by Desailly. The ball is played short, then across to the right flank, but the eventual cross meets the hands of Barthez.</p> <p><strong>5</strong> Henry, already looking lively, hits the outside of Francesco Toldo's left-hand post with the keeper left bewildered.</p> <p><strong>7</strong> Great play by Italy. Pessotto finds Fiore on the right flank. The Udinese man accelerates away from Lizarazu and places a great cross onto the head of Marco Delvecchio, but Barthez saves.</p> <p><strong>8</strong> Now it's the turn of the French to attack in this exhilarating opening to the game. Dugarry turns Cannavaro on the edge of the box and digs out a cross that finds Youri Djorkaeff. Djorkaeff takes the ball down on his chest wonderfully, but is crowded off the ball before he can shoot.</p> <p><strong>15</strong> Free-kick for Italy is taken by Demetrio Albertini, who ambitiously aims to curl the ball over Barthez from 30 yards. Not too surprisingly, he fails.</p> <p><strong>18</strong> The initially hectic pace of the game has slowed now, with the Italians sitting deeper and the French happily keeping possession in midfield. </p> <p><strong>19</strong> As an example of the way the game is currently going, Didier Deschamps is France's best attacking option as they congregate around the Italian box. The water carrier has a fiersome crack, but it flys a couple of feet over the bar.</p> <p><strong>21</strong> Another attack for the French fails to truly trouble the Italian defence. Christophe Dugarry shows some nice touches to find some space on the edge of the box, but his shot is immediately charged down by Alessandro Nesta. Not an unfamiliar sight.</p> <p><strong>23</strong> Dugarry's persistence wins the French a corner. Djorkaeff takes it, and Desailly meets it, but the ball is slowed by a defender's body and trickles just wide of goal.</p> <p><strong>26</strong> Henry, who seems to be sharing the left flank with Dugarry, mystifies Cannavaro with two step-overs in quick succession. The French forward then falls over, but referee Frisk sees no foul.</p> <p><strong>29</strong> A swift move across the box by the French almost lets in Henry. But Nesta is there, simply standing in Henry's path and refusing to let him turn.</p> <p><strong>30</strong> Henry on the ball again, this time embarking on a seemingly optimistic run at the Italian back seven. He leaves two for dead however and the third, Luigi Di Biagio, brings him down from behind. Yellow card, the first of the game.</p> <p><strong>34</strong> The last few, otherwise ordinary, minutes have been pepped up by the first signs of a tasty feud between Marcel Desailly and Delvecchio. Only pushing and name calling so far, but we live in hope. </p> <p><strong>38</strong> A half-chance, at last. Henry again finds space on the left, dragging Nesta wide with him. He then cuts inside and then produces a shot which turns into a good pass to Djorkaeff on the six yard line. Djorkaeff turns and toe-pokes the ball, but Toldo gets down and saves.</p> <p><strong>39</strong> France lose the ball deep in the Italian half, and Italy break quickly, with Albertini passing long to Delvecchio who lays the ball back to Totti who scuffs a shot wide. Not too dangerous, but a reminder to the French all the same.</p> <p><strong>41</strong> Another fiery run from Henry leaves Cannavaro shaking like a chandelier. Another rash challenge ensues, as does another yellow card.</p> <p><strong>43</strong> Paolo Maldini gets clear on the left wings and rushes into the box. His cross only reaches Desailly, but his clearance nearly falls at the feet of Delvecchio. Fortunately for the Chelsea man, Djorkaeff has tracked back and clears. </p> <p><strong>46</strong> Half-time.</p> <p><strong>45</strong> France kick-off. </p> <p><strong>46</strong> Zinedine Zidane makes his first potent contribution of the game. Gathering the ball in the business end of the field he gallops away from Albertini and slips a delicious ball inbetween Nesta and Cannavaro for Henry to run onto. Run onto it he does, beating Nesta to the ball, but his partner Cannavaro stands firm and gets a touch just before Henry can shoot.</p> <p><strong>49</strong> Henry creates the clearest opening of the game so far. The Arsenal striker again gets the ball on the left, beats Iuliano, then Cannavaro before crossing low across the goalmouth, beating opponents and teammates alike.</p> <p><strong>52</strong> Italian substitution: Alessandro Del Piero for Stefano Fiore. The golden boy makes his way off the bench once more. Will he make the difference this time?</p> <p><strong>53</strong> Perhaps by the process of osmosis, Del Piero's arrival inspires Italy's best attack of the match. Paolo Maldini, marauding down the left wing,. gets the bal from Albertini and crosses dangerously into the box. The ball eludes everyone again, but goes out for a corner.</p> <p><strong>55 GOAL! France 0 - 1 Italy</strong> It's magic! A touch of skill from Totti, the second decent cross of the game from Pessotto and a crisp left-foot finish from Delvecchio. Suddenly the outsiders have the lead. If only they were any good at defending...</p> <p><strong>56</strong> French substitution - Sylvain Wiltord for Christophe Dugarry. France go for it straightaway. Dugarry's had a good game, but the World Champions need goals.</p> <p><strong>59</strong> They almost needed another too, after a fast Italian break finds Del Piero in space. The \u00a360,000-a-week star has only Barthez to beat, but finishes woefully, dragging the ball wide of the far post. </p> <p><strong>61</strong> Zidane, now sitting much further forward, picks a pass that only he can, discombobulating two defenders and finding Sylvain Wiltord. The Bordeaux striker advances on goal from a narrow angle. He shoots, when passing to Djorkaeff would have made better sense, and Toldo's long legs clear.</p> <p><strong>65</strong> Italian substitution - Massimo Ambrosini for Luigi Di Biagio. Things get even tighter in the Italian midfield.</p> <p><strong>68</strong> Zidane takes a free-kick 10 yards outside the Italian area. The ball finds Henry in the six-yard box. His touch is immaculate, but so is Toldo's anticicpation and the keeper gets down to the striker's quick shot.</p> <p><strong>69</strong> Another dangerous break from the Italians. Totti is the initiator (the Roma man looking more comfortable in a deeper midfield role), picking out Delvecchio with a 30-yard pass. Delvecchio receives the ball, but the attentions of Laurent Blanc leads him to strike wide.</p> <p><strong>74</strong> Totti again instigates a valuable period of possession for the Italians, getting the ball in midfield finding Delvecchio and charging up the field in time to receive a return pass. He then slips the ball to Del Piero on the edge of the box, but the golden boy slips over. Maybe Zoff had it right all along.</p> <p><strong>75</strong> French substitution: David Trezeguet for Youri Djorkaeff. That's three French strikers on the field and Zidane..</p> <p><strong>79</strong> Zidane gets the ball in the Italian box, he skins Paolo Maldini twice, but is brought to a halt by an excellent challenge from... er... Allessandro Del Piero. So that's why he's come on then.</p> <p><strong>83</strong> At this stage of the game, even the reluctant Lilian Thuram is getting forward. He beats Maldini too and produces a fabulous cross from the touchline. But no-one is there to meet it for France, and not for the first time.</p> <p><strong>84</strong> The ball springs to the other end immediately. Totti finds Pessotto who picks out Ambrosini, who slyly slides the ball left into Del Piero's path. It's a similar position to the one he missed from a few minutes ago, and this time his first-time shot cannons off Barthez's legs.</p> <p><strong>85</strong> Italian substitution: Vincenzo Montella for Marco Delvecchio<br> French substitution: Robert Pires for Bixente Lizarazu.</p> <p><strong>89</strong> More French pressure, and more Italian interceptions. The world champions don't look like finding a way through, but they've got four minutes of injury time in which to do it.</p> <p><strong>93 GOAL! France 1 - 1 Italy</strong> Would you believe it. One minute left and again France gain possession on the left hand side of the Italian box. Wiltord beats Cannavaro and once more a shot aims for the far post. This time however the shot finds its target, eluding Toldo's massive reach and nestling insde the net. Game on again, and what a time to do it.</p> <p><strong>94</strong> Full-time brings extra time. Alessandro del Piero, how are you feeling?</p> <p><strong>1</strong> Italy kick off.</p> <p><strong>2</strong> Zidane finds Henry in that left-wing position with Trezeguet advancing into the box too, but the striker neither crosses nor shoots and an opportunity is wasted.</p> <p><strong>4</strong> More French pressure results in a long-range shot from Robert Pires that Toldo can't quite handle. He recovers quickly however, and gets a boot in the face from Trezeguet for his trouble. </p> <p><strong>8</strong> Del Piero gets the ball with his back to goal. He controls, spins, and... shoots miles over again.</p> <p><strong>9</strong> This time it's the French who break quickly and Ambrosini is forced to bring down Wiltord. Zidane steps up for the free-kick, in a similar position to the one he scored from against Spain, and misses.</p> <p><strong>11</strong> A nice cross from Pires is met by an acrobatic volley from Zidane which deflects off Maldini for a corner.</p> <p><strong>12 GOLDEN GOAL! FRANCE 2 - 1 ITALY</strong> Pires makes the opening, beating two men, dinking the ball over Pessotto's outstretched leg and tearing into the area. Nesta goes to cover, but Pires surprises him and instead of crossing pulls the ball back. David Trezeguet, waiting in the six-yard box, takes one step back from his marker and smashes the ball with his left foot into the roof of the net. France are European champions, and what a way to do it.</p>",

Djorkaeff takes the ball down on his chest wonderfully, but is crowded off the ball before he can shoot. 15 Free-kick for Italy is taken by Demetrio Albertini, who ambitiously aims to curl the ball over Barthez from 30 yards. Not too surprisingly, he fails. 18 The initially hectic pace of the game has slowed now, with the Italians sitting deeper and the French happily keeping possession in midfield. 19 As an example of the way the game is currently going, Didier Deschamps is France's best attacking option as they congregate around the Italian box. The water carrier has a fiersome crack, but it flys a couple of feet over the bar. 21 Another attack for the French fails to truly trouble the Italian defence. Christophe Dugarry shows some nice touches to find some space on the edge of the box, but his shot is immediately charged down by Alessandro Nesta. Not an unfamiliar sight. 23 Dugarry's persistence wins the French a corner. Djorkaeff takes it, and Desailly meets it, but the ball is slowed by a defender's body and trickles just wide of goal. 26 Henry, who seems to be sharing the left flank with Dugarry, mystifies Cannavaro with two step-overs in quick succession. The French forward then falls over, but referee Frisk sees no foul. 29 A swift move across the box by the French almost lets in Henry. But Nesta is there, simply standing in Henry's path and refusing to let him turn. 30 Henry on the ball again, this time embarking on a seemingly optimistic run at the Italian back seven. He leaves two for dead however and the third, Luigi Di Biagio, brings him down from behind. Yellow card, the first of the game. 34 The last few, otherwise ordinary, minutes have been pepped up by the first signs of a tasty feud between Marcel Desailly and Delvecchio. Only pushing and name calling so far, but we live in hope. 38 A half-chance, at last. Henry again finds space on the left, dragging Nesta wide with him. He then cuts inside and then produces a shot which turns into a good pass to Djorkaeff on the six yard line. Djorkaeff turns and toe-pokes the ball, but Toldo gets down and saves. 39 France lose the ball deep in the Italian half, and Italy break quickly, with Albertini passing long to Delvecchio who lays the ball back to Totti who scuffs a shot wide. Not too dangerous, but a reminder to the French all the same. 41 Another fiery run from Henry leaves Cannavaro shaking like a chandelier. Another rash challenge ensues, as does another yellow card. 43 Paolo Maldini gets clear on the left wings and rushes into the box. His cross only reaches Desailly, but his clearance nearly falls at the feet of Delvecchio. Fortunately for the Chelsea man, Djorkaeff has tracked back and clears. 46 Half-time. 45 France kick-off. 46 Zinedine Zidane makes his first potent contribution of the game. Gathering the ball in the business end of the field he gallops away from Albertini and slips a delicious ball inbetween Nesta and Cannavaro for Henry to run onto. Run onto it he does, beating Nesta to the ball, but his partner Cannavaro stands firm and gets a touch just before Henry can shoot. 49 Henry creates the clearest opening of the game so far. The Arsenal striker again gets the ball on the left, beats Iuliano, then Cannavaro before crossing low across the goalmouth, beating opponents and teammates alike. 52 Italian substitution: Alessandro Del Piero for Stefano Fiore. The golden boy makes his way off the bench once more. Will he make the difference this time? 53 Perhaps by the process of osmosis, Del Piero's arrival inspires Italy's best attack of the match. Paolo Maldini, marauding down the left wing,. gets the bal from Albertini and crosses dangerously into the box. The ball eludes everyone again, but goes out for a corner. 55 GOAL! France 0 - 1 Italy It's magic! A touch of skill from Totti, the second decent cross of the game from Pessotto and a crisp left-foot finish from Delvecchio. Suddenly the outsiders have the lead. If only they were any good at defending... 56 French substitution - Sylvain Wiltord for Christophe Dugarry. France go for it straightaway. Dugarry's had a good game, but the World Champions need goals. 59 They almost needed another too, after a fast Italian break finds Del Piero in space. The \u00a360,000-a-week star has only Barthez to beat, but finishes woefully, dragging the ball wide of the far post. 61 Zidane, now sitting much further forward, picks a pass that only he can, discombobulating two defenders and finding Sylvain Wiltord. The Bordeaux striker advances on goal from a narrow angle. He shoots, when passing to Djorkaeff would have made better sense, and Toldo's long legs clear. 65 Italian substitution - Massimo Ambrosini for Luigi Di Biagio. Things get even tighter in the Italian midfield. 68 Zidane takes a free-kick 10 yards outside the Italian area. The ball finds Henry in the six-yard box. His touch is immaculate, but so is Toldo's anticicpation and the keeper gets down to the striker's quick shot. 69 Another dangerous break from the Italians. Totti is the initiator (the Roma man looking more comfortable in a deeper midfield role), picking out Delvecchio with a 30-yard pass. Delvecchio receives the ball, but the attentions of Laurent Blanc leads him to strike wide. 74 Totti again instigates a valuable period of possession for the Italians, getting the ball in midfield finding Delvecchio and charging up the field in time to receive a return pass. He then slips the ball to Del Piero on the edge of the box, but the golden boy slips over. Maybe Zoff had it right all along. 75 French substitution: David Trezeguet for Youri Djorkaeff. That's three French strikers on the field and Zidane.. 79 Zidane gets the ball in the Italian box, he skins Paolo Maldini twice, but is brought to a halt by an excellent challenge from... er... Allessandro Del Piero. So that's why he's come on then. 83 At this stage of the game, even the reluctant Lilian Thuram is getting forward. He beats Maldini too and produces a fabulous cross from the touchline. But no-one is there to meet it for France, and not for the first time. 84 The ball springs to the other end immediately. Totti finds Pessotto who picks out Ambrosini, who slyly slides the ball left into Del Piero's path. It's a similar position to the one he missed from a few minutes ago, and this time his first-time shot cannons off Barthez's legs. 85 Italian substitution: Vincenzo Montella for Marco Delvecchio French substitution: Robert Pires for Bixente Lizarazu. 89 More French pressure, and more Italian interceptions. The world champions don't look like finding a way through, but they've got four minutes of injury time in which to do it. 93 GOAL! France 1 - 1 Italy Would you believe it. One minute left and again France gain possession on the left hand side of the Italian box. Wiltord beats Cannavaro and once more a shot aims for the far post. This time however the shot finds its target, eluding Toldo's massive reach and nestling insde the net. Game on again, and what a time to do it. 94 Full-time brings extra time. Alessandro del Piero, how are you feeling? 1 Italy kick off. 2 Zidane finds Henry in that left-wing position with Trezeguet advancing into the box too, but the striker neither crosses nor shoots and an opportunity is wasted. 4 More French pressure results in a long-range shot from Robert Pires that Toldo can't quite handle. He recovers quickly however, and gets a boot in the face from Trezeguet for his trouble. 8 Del Piero gets the ball with his back to goal. He controls, spins, and... shoots miles over again. 9 This time it's the French who break quickly and Ambrosini is forced to bring down Wiltord. Zidane steps up for the free-kick, in a similar position to the one he scored from against Spain, and misses. 11 A nice cross from Pires is met by an acrobatic volley from Zidane which deflects off Maldini for a corner. 12 GOLDEN GOAL! FRANCE 2 - 1 ITALY Pires makes the opening, beating two men, dinking the ball over Pessotto's outstretched leg and tearing into the area. Nesta goes to cover, but Pires surprises him and instead of crossing pulls the ball back. David Trezeguet, waiting in the six-yard box, takes one step back from his marker and smashes the ball with his left foot into the roof of the net. France are European champions, and what a way to do it.",

Walsh and Ambrose realised immediately what was required and adapted accord ingly. They both pitched the ball back of a length and used the cracks in the pitch.

Whether it hits the pads or the poles, the batters are in trouble. </p> <p>They also altered the way the ball came out of the hand. On a Lord's-type surface, they bowl seam-up and on a length. This means that the ball kisses the deck and the pitch does the work. Up in Birmingham, they put a lot more energy on the ball and this could be seen on the replays. This means that the ball stays in contact with the pitch a fraction longer and therefore has more of a chance to do something. It's very similar to a golfer pitching on to a hard green. With plenty of energy on the ball, a player gets a lot of bite and the ball grips and stays put. </p> <p>Having that ability is a huge advantage on the baked clay conditions we encountered in Birmingham. </p> <p>West Indies' back-up bowlers, Reon King and Franklyn Rose, are both quicker than Walsh and Ambrose but not nearly so consistent. They bowl the odd 'four' ball and this takes the pressure off the batsmen. The big two keep you thinking the whole time and give very little away.

I believe the secret to this is how loose they are. Their actions are fluid and require remarkably little effort, which therefore doesn't take much out of them. A lot of bowlers put 100 per cent into every delivery and sooner or later that will take its toll. </p> <p>I don't know Curtly very well but Courtney is a total gentleman off the pitch.

It happened at Edgbaston and yesterday's premature end at Lord's was threatened only by fading light. </p> <p>I lay much of the blame on the Lord's wicket. The strip looked very poor to me, with uneven bounce which made it very difficult for the batsmen. After 21 wickets fell on Friday, I wonder if the pitch-inspectors will be called in. In my judgment they should be, and if this Test was being played at any venue other than headquarters, that would be a formality. We all know the commercial clout wielded by Lord's Tests, but the pitch has not been at all good. </p> <p>Even the Roses match finished early yesterday. Pitches all over the country seem to be deteriorating and if we want to produce top- class batsmen and bowlers then we need top-class pitches for them to perform on. It's not the first time Lord's has been suspect because I remember Raymond Illingworth bitterly complaining about this wicket when he captained England. </p> <p>All of which puts Michael Vaughan's performance yesterday into context. His was a superb, mature innings in the most trying circumstances. I remember saying last year that Vaughan should be given a go and some of the more mediocre players of my own generation snorted at my opinion, suggesting I was simply backing another Yorkshireman. Not so - and perhaps those critics might think again. I suggest Vaughan will now get the run he deserves - certainly that his innings yesterday deserved. </p> <p>Remember, this was his debut at Lord's in a Test. There was a lot riding on his performance and conditions were not in his favour. Credit must go to Michael Atherton for the way he assisted, coaxed and cajoled Vaughan in the afternoon session. I'm sure Atherton must have done quite a lot of talking; a lot of reassuring. Vaughan responded and the stand set up England. They took their chance even if there was a wobble, but comeback boy Dominic Cork and Darren Gough batted well and sensibly to see us home. </p> <p>Having said that, West Indies disappointed me. They appeared negative, refusing to crowd the bat, and several early chances went through the slip cordon - where just two men were stationed. Vaughan had a couple sneak through there, Atherton escaped once and Hick could have been out within a few balls of arriving at the crease. I think West Indies had enough runs to warrant a real attack early on. </p> <p>If Vaughan deserves credit with the bat, praise goes to Andy Caddick with the ball. He bowled beautifully on Friday but his performance underlines why I believe the central contracts system is not necessarily a good thing. </p> <p>Caddick, like myself when I played, is a rhythm bowler. He needs to play, to bowl, to stay in the groove. It might also explain why questions are being asked about the discrepancy between his first- innings performances in Tests, which are ordinary, compared to very good returns in second innings. He needs to bowl, needs to work himself into a rhythm, but how can he do that when he is withdrawn from county cricket by Team England? Not all bowlers are the same. Some need to rest and can slot back into action. My old pal Brian Statham was like that - he didn't need constant action. I fancy Caddick might be better served away from the seclusion and bending his back between Tests. </p> <p>His performance also demonstrated what a good bowler Caddick is when he pitches the ball on a decent length. He can often look ordinary when he gets frustrated and bowls some two feet short. Not so on Friday.</p>",

      "body": "<p>'Who writes your scripts?' a bemused Graham Gooch once asked Ian Botham after a miraculous return to Test cricket. I never discovered the precise answer but I can tell you it's the same bloke used by Dominic Cork. </p> <p>In the gloaming at Lord's in front of an enthralled, nail-biting capacity crowd Cork led England to victory by two wickets in the most pulsating finish to a Lord's Test since the 1963 match against the West Indies. </p> <p>Joining forces with Darren Gough with 28 runs required and two wickets remaining the Derbyshire captain, almost short-circuiting on adrenalin, guided England home. His assault on the hapless Franklyn Rose was breathtaking on a surface where batsmen had been tormented since Thursday tea time. There was a clip for two, then a spectacular pulled six into the grandstand. Next he deposited the wilting Rose over mid-on. Suddenly England sensed they could win again. </p> <p>Now Cork and Gough, admirably calm and correct in a crisis, opted for singles, often scrambled singles. Despite the Herculean efforts of Courtney Walsh, who took six wickets and his old partner Curtly Ambrose, they took England to their target at 7.03pm - another watershed for English cricket? Who knows? Two leg byes tied the game; then Cork calmly guided the ball down to the Tavern and the celebrations could begin. </p> <p>This is a game that tantalises, teases and tortures. I guess that's why we watch it. On Friday it sped thrillingly towards its climax. But yesterday we were denied a swift conclusion. It was always going to be agonising and indeed the progress of a match that had suddenly captured the public's imagination (Euro 2000 - what's that? Tim who?) was at times painfully slow; at others painfully frenetic. It was brilliant cricket. </p> <p>Dank cloud cover and flecks of drizzle kept the groundstaff on the alert. Just 43 minutes of play were possible in the morning; Curtly Ambrose reeled off maidens. If England were to defeat the West Indies it was going to take an awful long time. And to prevent their season from disintegrating they had to win. </p> <p>But after Friday no-one with any sense was making any predictions except the usual one: so much depends on Atherton. It was soon clear that when the England opener woke yesterday he was excited rather than intimidated by the prospect, the hallmark of a proper Test player. Of course he played and missed at Ambrose but there was no mistaking his resolve. </p> <p>You could not say the same about Mark Ramprakash. After avoiding a pair by deflecting Walsh wide of gully in the first over of the day, he fell in the fifth without adding to his score. As he attempted to force a shortish ball from Walsh , the ball ricocheted off the inside edge on to his stumps. The bat was crooked as he looked for the ball and he left an agonisingly discon solate figure. His record at Lord's where he plays his county cricket is baffling, 81 runs from 11 innings. </p> <p>During that first 40 minutes batting looked impossible. Ambrose yielded one run in six overs , a push to mid-on for a single from the 27th ball Atherton had received. Amb-rose passed the outside edge, the inside edge and gradually those knowing smiles gave way to exasperation. </p> <p>At the other end Walsh was as testing but occasionally offered something to hit. Just before the interruption Atherton punched him square for four, then hooked him to square leg. There were roars of relief from a capacity crowd. </p> <p>After an extended interval there was little respite especially for Vaughan. He might have been lbw to Walsh; there was a concerted appeal for a caught behind two balls later. Ambrose beat him time and time again. All this before he had scored. Eventually he stroked a straight drive for three from his 29th ball. What torment. Yet throughout Vaughan had given the appearance of calm, that he knew what he was trying to do. This calmness under siege - he had some practise in Johannesburg in the winter - is his greatest asset. </p> <p>Then imperceptibly the runs started to come. Inevitably this coincided with the removal of Ambrose from the attack; his first thirteen overs cost thirteen runs and four of those were from the luckiest of inside edges from the bat of Vaughan. Obviously England were determined to be aggressive against the support bowlers, to prey on their inexperience. This worked. Vaughan immediately clipped Rose through the onside; Atherton unveiled a handsome cover drive. This pair stole the odd quick single and England were on the move. </p> <p>Both King and Rose bowled some serious deliveries but they were not mesmeric; there was always the hope of runs and Vaughan took them adroitly. The match was slipping away from the West Indies - England were now 95-1 after 36 overs - so Jimmy Adams had to turn to Walsh again. </p> <p>Walsh delivered. It was not a spectacular ball, just short of a length outside off stump, but Vaughan nibbled and Jacobs took a straightforward catch. Vaughan's 41 represented untold riches by England's recent standards and has booked his place for the Old Trafford Test. He rarely takes the breath away but he thrives on the occasion. At the moment that's enough. </p> <p>How would Graeme Hick react to such a taut situation? His second ball from Walsh brought great encouragement to England. He cracked it to the cover boundary off the back foot. His third shaved his off stump. He tried to remain positive but after tea he drove away from his body and presented Lara at first slip with a regulation catch. </p> <p>At the other end Atherton had been imperturbable, but he was promptly lbw to Walsh after 212 minutes of service. 120-4. Alec Stewart's inclination was to put everyone out their delicious misery swiftly. Not possible against Walsh but when Rose dropped short he twice pulled him imperiously to the mid-wicket boundary. </p> <p>But Walsh jagged a ball back down the slope and up went umpire Venkat's finger. Three balls later it was in the air again, less justifiably as he gave Craig White caught behind off the inside edge - or his thigh. 140-6. By now Knight was calmed. It had been reported that there was 'no major fracture' of the finger damaged in the field on Friday. It may be broken which would explain why he was unable to attempt forcing strokes. </p> <p>Knight soon departed edging Rose to the keeper. Ambrose returned from the Pavilion End and at 160 Caddick was patently lbw. Most thought it was all over for England. Dominic Cork most certainly didn't.</p>",

Well, they always say that. But he was clearly doing more than spinning a line. Self-evidently Cork was ready to come back. He talked of the frustration of knowing that you're good enough, yet being sidelined and the need to seize the chance when it came. We can safely say he's done that as well. </p> <p>Even before he picked up his bat late yesterday afternoon he had had a brilliant match. By the time he placed it back in his cricket bag he had had an unforgettable one. 'I'm more disciplined now, but still aggressive,' he said. This combination of qualities was the hallmark of Cork's performance with the ball in this match, with the bat he was just inspirational. </p> <p>His contribution here initially called to mind his remarkable Test debut against the West Indies at Lord's five years ago --7 for 43 and all that. In that match he started as England's first change support bowler, consigned to bowling into the wind or at the wrong end. He ended it as England's number-one strike bowler. </p> <p>In this game he has not leapfrogged England's other pacemen. Darren Gough in the first innings, Andy Caddick in the second have ensured that they remain in possession of the new ball for the foreseeable future, but his contribution has been immense. </p> <p>His performance on the first day when the West Indies appeared to be en route to 400 was overshadowed by his stunning innings, but nonetheless it was vital. </p> <p>For the first three hours of the match the ball declined to swing; batting seemed a gentle occupation. Cork did something about that. For even though the speedster, often a disingenuous device, told us that he was the slowest of England's pace attack, it was Cork who first decided to hit the wicket. This means banging the ball into the pitch hard, rather than bowling pretty away-swingers. Cork can not only swing the ball but he can also bowl skidding bouncers and short balls that discomfort the batsmen. </p> <p>Cork, rather than Gough or Caddick, had the wit to change tack on day one. Campbell was bounced and was out hooking; Hinds was surprised by several short balls; Jacobs was also out hooking and Cork was commendably quick to bounce Ambrose. Then, as the wickets started to tumble, the ball could be spied swinging and batting was thereafter a struggle for everyone. </p> <p>Throughout the match Cork offered no easy runs. He hasn't asked the ball to swing too much by pitching on the right-hander's leg stump in pursuit of the miracle ball. In the second innings when the ball was swinging and Caddick was running riot at the other end, he tried nothing too ambitious. He merely kept his line to the left-handers, sustained the pressure and was duly rewarded. And he batted quite well.</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Sometimes the simplest things are the most memorable. Four delicious days of rising with the sun, swimming naked in translucent waters; three nights in a wooden shack on the beach with no electricity, running water or lavatories (it was the sea or the bushes): this was Tulum, the hippy hang out on Mexico's Caribbean coast, the Mayan resort of good karma, where the ancient ruins on the clifftop mark the place the ley lines supposedly cross. It was a fantastic time, but by the end of it our bodies were so caked in layers of salt, sand, suntan lotion and after-sun cream that we thought we'd never be clean again. And it was making us irritable. We needed to move on. </p> <p>Two hours ride inland on an air-conditioned coach brought us to the dusty village of Coba and the five-star splendour of Villas Archaeologicas. (Such is the prerogative of the budget traveller with healthy plastic back-up. Mind you, at \u00a340 a night, it was hardly a splurge). </p> <p>The name conjured up an image of faded colonial grandeur. I imagined a rambling Spanish mansion, with cool interiors and peeling plaster. Maybe an overgrown courtyard with a mucky pool, with dark green fronds lapping at dark green water. </p> <p>In fact, it was a thoroughly modern 40-room Club Med hotel, luxurious yet slightly characterless in a white and terracotta Seventies style. The aesthetics were not uppermost in our minds, though. What we cared about was a shower, a shave and a lavatory. </p> <p>The guidebook told us Coba was a little-visited place, and the hotel was nearly empty. A group of eight Europeans checked in after us, but the only other guests we saw were a French couple, who constantly played Travel Scrabble and a family of American evangelists. After lunch we watched the evangelist father lead the three gleaming children in Bible study in the restaurant. The hotel is not a reason in itself to come to Coba. People come to see the ruins of the ancient city of the same name, which spread out through the rainforest for about 50 square miles. The entire site is a national park. The road into the village leads to a crocodile-infested lake, then skirts round it to the park entrance and heads off into the rainforest to somewhere bigger, grander. </p> <p>The buildings in Coba are mainly low-rise concrete. On one side are grubby tourist shops and restaurants. With few customers the waiters spend their days sweeping the spotless floors and watching Mexican soap operas. On the other side are mainly houses, a tortilleria (where we saw a whole family pounding, kneading, rolling and slapping thin circles of dough on to a conveyor belt into the oven) and a concrete basketball court, where the town's teenagers were hanging out. </p> <p>The heat is so relentless that it seems as though everything is done at half speed. Even shooting a few hoops is apparently done in slow motion. </p> <p>In the lake lazed a single crocodile: none of the thrashing about I had hoped for, with a tourist or a small animal in its jaws; rather it snoozed languidly in the shallows, seemingly aching for shade. </p> <p>The crocodiles may seem uninterested, but the dogs are even more listless. When you walk by they stand in the middle of the road staring at you. But they don't bark and run up to you like most dogs. Instead the mangy mutts just yawn and pad lazily away, glassy-eyed, bored. The children, on the other hand, are the most animated I have ever seen. And the place is overrun with them - scrawny, grinning bundles of energy, laughing and chasing you down the road. The dogs are like rats. This place could be where the Pied Piper stopped and set up home. That the children and the dogs are tiny and undernourished is a sure sign that the trickle-down effects of the Mexican eco nomic miracle or the direct benefits of tourism haven't reached the townspeople. It made us feel slightly awkward, knowing that little of the money we spent in the hotel would stay in Coba. </p> <p>However, such thoughts were far off as we ate dinner by the pool and got slowly drunk. Around us the Bible family were giving thanks for each tortilla, the French couple were running out of Scrabble letters (how many points for 'ennui'?) and the tour group were playing drinking games with tequila, creme de menthe and cheap white wine. </p> <p>We wandered out of that sanitised environment in search of a bit of air and walked straight into Coba's carnival. Some Mexican towns celebrate the week before Lent in good Catholic tradition, with parades, dances and concerts. Here, everyone gets involved. Excited children were parading through town, dressed in colourful home-made costumes: ballet dancers, ancient Egyptians, Mayan chiefs, even a rabbit. There were six or seven makeshift floats, decorated bicycles and carts mainly pushed along by adults or the bigger children. Like some toothless reptile the parade lumbered through the dark ness, lurching out of the shadows into the startling buzz of a street lamp or the headlights of an accompanying car. One float was a warrior's chariot, with Termenator [sic] written on the side in pen. On another, a brown and yellow tower resembled a giraffe's head, leaning sadly to one side. A cart covered in blue and gold painted cardboard was a royal landau. In it sat the carnival king and queen, he holding a cardboard sceptre and she with a silver foil key to the town. A single mangy pony pulled the cart. So, this really was a one-horse town. </p> <p>Yes, it was low-key and childish. Yes, it was cheap and makeshift, but the point is that it was something real and alive. It belonged to the town. Unlike the ruined city which is the only Coba that visitors want to know about, unlike our fancy hotel which took from the town but gave little back, this parade was on the town's own terms. </p> <p>The children were loving it, their round faces shining, mouths wide open, coughing with laughter. The adults were dressed in their finest clothes, proud of their collective efforts and, best of all, we were part of it. It wasn't put on for our benefit, they got nothing from us being there, but they were so friendly towards us that we felt welcome immediately. The children squealed with delight as we took photographs and called out 'ola' one after the other, as though one of them doing it gave courage to the next. </p> <p>I spoke - if that's how you can describe my faltering juxtaposition of Spanish words - to some of them and they told me what everyone around them was called. I asked when that night's dance started and they told me nine o'clock. </p> <p>'Pero es muy tarde!' I joked, and when I said they would have to be in bed by then they laughed even more. </p> <p> The parade ended in the car park, where it had begun, and I smugly thought of the other guests in the hotel: they had no idea what was going on just a few yards from where they were tucking into dessert. They probably weren't interested - most of them were on a one-night stopover as part of an organised archaeological tour, and would be conserv ing their energies for the next day's exploring. Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to preach. It's fine to admire majestic ruins, but why not also celebrate something full of life which is happening around the corner? </p> <p>Much later, we went to the 'park' where the town dance was taking place. It was a concrete circle with four concrete paths radiating outwards. A mediocre band played something between mariachi and calypso on a small wooden stage. Disco lights throbbed out of time. About a dozen young couples danced, just as lazily as they went about their daily business, the girls dressed in frills and the boys in smart trousers and shirts. In the shadows around the dancefloor were more people, mainly older. Some were seated at tables drinking and talking, perhaps remembering dances past. Others were just lurking, unsure how to join in. The smaller children - whose enthusiasm and excitement had driven the parade earlier - had gone to bed and had taken their energy with them. The town had worn itself out. There was no more fun to be had. </p> <p>We got up early the next morning, before the sun was on the lake and headed to the national park. We hired bikes and cycled round the thousand-year-old ruins. They were awe-inspiring. We climbed the main pyramid, Nohoch Mul, which, at 120ft, is the tallest Mayan structure in the the Yucatan peninsula. The top rises elegantly above the rainforest canopy. From up there we could see the lake glinting in the morning sun, the town lying sleepily under a low cloud of dust and the road snaking off into the distance. A few hours later we were there, on a bus heading through the jungle to somewhere bigger, livelier. </p> <p>The imperious majesty of ancient Coba, dead but not forgotten, was what we imagined before we came; what we took with us was the humanity of a Coba forgotten but not dead, its people existing in the shadow of their predecessors, sluggishly beating out a life under the sun with a sad and gentle grace. </p> <p>Sometimes the simplest things are the most memorable.</p>",

The imperious majesty of ancient Coba, dead but not forgotten, was what we imagined before we came; what we took with us was the humanity of a Coba forgotten but not dead, its people existing in the shadow of their predecessors, sluggishly beating out a life under the sun with a sad and gentle grace. Sometimes the simplest things are the most memorable.",

      "body": "<p>There are many exotic spots in the world where old pop stars come, musically, to die. However, Phnom Penh, the filthy, crazy, frightening, beautiful capital of Cambodia, is not usually one of them. </p> <p>And yet it is here, overlooking the mighty Mekong River in a bar with ceiling fans shifting the sticky night air that we find... well, who exactly? His name is Duncan Kilburn and he owns the bar. Cambodian women in long silk dresses are serving beer to sweaty expats and the odd backpacker who's swerved off the trail between Thailand and Vietnam. Most people between 25 and 50 will have heard of his band, the Psychedelic Furs. Ah yes. Part of the quintessential, new wave British sound of the early Eighties. </p> <p>Kilburn played saxophone. Twenty years on, the balding, frayed 44-year-old has washed up in Phnom Penh of all places. He admits who he is and agrees to tell his story - and talk about Cambodia. </p> <p>It is midnight. There are lizards on the wall and Lancashire hotpot on the menu. Prostitutes are loitering outside and beggars, maimed by the millions of mines strewn across this shattered land, crouch on the potholed pavement. </p> <p>Kilburn is strumming the guitar and singing or, more accurately, strangling Lou Reed's 'Walk on the Wild Side'. It is an appropriate number because Phnom Penh(pronounced P'nom Pen) is generally described as the Wild East, the final frontier of lawlessness in Asia. </p> <p>The city no longer goes to sleep to the sound of Pol Pot's death squads murdering innocent citizens and personal quarrels are less likely to be settled by hand grenade than they were a few years ago. But the peace is fragile; poverty and corruption are the norm. The atmosphere is edgy. It is a toss-up whether residents are more likely to be run over by a petty official's limo, bought with siphoned foreign aid, or mugged by a bloke with an AK-47. </p> <p>And all this within a few yards of the glittering royal palace and ancient temples - surrounded by squalor but magnificent enough to remind you how far this once-powerful civilisation has fallen. </p> <p>Every moped-taxi driver has a tale about how half his family were wiped out in the mid-Seventies when the Khmer Rouge emptied Phnom Penh in two weeks. They herded everyone off to the 'killing fields' to engage in a catastrophic experiment in collectivism and despotism that left about two million people dead - a fifth of the population of Cambodia. </p> <p>It was at about this time that Kilburn and a few mates formed The Furs in distant London. The band burned briefly but brightly and was big enough to be supported by U2. While Pol Pot rampaged, Kilburn was half a planet away, touring New York and mingling with Iggy Pop and David Bowie at the height of the Furs' success. </p> <p> Vietnam invaded Cambodia and ended Pol Pot's dictatorship in 1980. Alcohol, stress and drug-tinged scandal put an acrimonious end to the Psychedelic Furs in 1982. </p> <p>Kilburn has not seen his band-mates since. After the split, he reverted to his day job of computer programmer. He was posted to Hong Kong, where he slipped into conventionalism and eventually became an entrepreneur. He opened a bar called the Globe, then ventured forth, seeking untapped markets. This led him to Cambodia, where he opened his bar and restaurant, also called the Globe. He is convinced the prospect of political stability will bring tourists and investors flocking and make his fortune. </p> <p>So it is that on a mosquito-filled night in Phnom Penh towards the end of the rainy season, Kilburn is to be found giving one of his regular little gigs. He follows the Lou Reed number with one of his own, The Furs' 'Femme Fatale'. Appropriate again, given Cambodia's stomach-churning sex industry. A 10-minute moped ride from the Globe will find you in a flesh market thinly disguised as a disco. It's all here in Phnom Penh, but with a little less neon than Bangkok. Man wants 10-year-old boy for sex? Just pay a few extra dollars to the shoeshine waifs who flit around the pavement cafes. </p> <p>Back at the Globe, Kilburn puts down his guitar and wanders on to the balcony to observe this unhinged capital. </p> <p>'The number one law in Cambodia is there is no law,' he says. 'This feels like the last Asian outpost of anarchy.' </p> <p>He points to the dusty, potholed road below, the only thing between the Globe and the vast, palm-lined Mekong River gliding by on its way from Tibet to Vietnam and the South China Sea. 'Look around and what do you see?' he asks. Answer: A sleek Toyota coup\u00e9 with smoked windows and no markings cruising along a battered scrap of street. </p> <p>'People driving smart cars with no number plates,' he says. 'This is one of the poorest countries on earth, with no economic structure to speak of. Where do you think those come from?' Misused aid, diverted into the pockets of government cronies. </p> <p>Sure, there's been an official crackdown on the trade in surplus arms. It is apparently no longer so easy to buy grenades, automatic guns and rocket launchers in a market for little more than the price of bananas. And the octogenarian 'ganja grannies', who used to sell cannabis on open stalls have had to become more clandestine. Cambodia has seen off the Khmer Rouge and the vulnerable regime is struggling for respectability.But not an awful lot has changed beneath the surface. </p> <p> 'You can buy heroin in the drugstore, and there is a big under-age sex trade,' says Kilburn. When I arrived in 1997 you could buy a hand grenade for $5 [\u00a33], and ordinary folk carried guns. If you are caught with such things now they will put you in prison... at least until you find $10 to buy your way out.' </p> <p>Corruption is, he says, a fact of life. He won't go into details, but he and his wife and young son were forced to flee to Malaysia and lie low for a while in 1998. Five men had burst into the Globe and held machine guns to his wife's head in some unspecified, mafia-type property dispute involving an ex-Minister with enormous underworld power. </p> <p>Only temporarily deterred, the family came back. Kilburn is now exploring new opportunities for business on Cambodia's unspoilt coastline, and inland at the ramshackle temple ruins around spectacular Angkor Wat - one of the seven wonders of the world. </p> <p>He never made a fortune from the Furs, although he still receives modest royalty cheques, including one for \u00a3200 the week before from sales of the band's best-known album, Pretty in Pink . His hope that Cambodia will join the tourist trail in the new millennium is by no means guaranteed, however. Much of the country was out of bounds to foreigners until recently, except to mine-clearance experts. </p> <p>Even now diplomatic staff are warning their expat citizens, off the record, that the shaky peace could blow apart with the impending show trials of two of the late Pol Pot's henchmen. Thousands of former Khmer Rouge have been brought out of exile on the Thai border, given amnesty and absorbed into the Cambodian establishment in the past few years. But a few ringleaders, who failed to remain inconspicuous, will face the music. As one expat said sagely: 'Never be the last to be caught.' </p> <p>Due in the dock soon are ruthless commander Ta Mok, 'The Butcher', and torture master 'Deuch' of the infamous Tuol Sleng detention centre, now a desolate museum, with row after row of soul-chilling photographs of the old regime's victims - before and after torture. </p> <p>Even Prime Minister Hun Sen, ex-Khmer Rouge, defector to Vietnam and now a moderate, though autocratic, leader, is caught up in allegations that his wife was involved in the murder of a beautiful Cambodian actress, reportedly Hun Sen's mistress. </p> <p>To cap it all, one of the most stabilising factors in Cambodia today, the arch-survivor and political chameleon King Norodom Sihanouk, who has been in and out of government for more than 40 years, threatens to shatter the jittery calm by dying and pro voking a power struggle. He lies frail with cancer in the royal palace. Meanwhile, around the corner, another of Phnom Penh's bizarre residents sits in the legendary Foreign Correspondents' Club waiting for Sihanouk's epochal death so that he can write the final chapter of his history of modern Cambodia. </p> <p>Al Rockoff is the renowned American war photographer best remembered in recent times via his big-screen alter ego John Malkovich, who portrayed him in the movie The Killing Fields . Rockoff was the photographer who tried, but failed, to fake a passport for Dith Pran, the Cambodian assistant of New York Times journalist Sydney Schanberg, when the Khmer Rouge took Phnom Penh. The real Rockoff apparently returns to Phnom Pehn regularly. Fans say he needs to research his book, local cynics scoff that he is a sad has-been, still wallowing in atrocious/glorious war memories. </p> <p>One FCC regular says: 'He'll bend your ear about his Khmer Rouge days if he's in the mood, has a few beers or a busty blonde for an audience. But don't ask him about the Killing Fields film - he says it's inaccurate.' </p> <p>Rockoff certainly looks the stereotypical, cantankerous veteran of Camodia's gory/glory years. The craggy, aloof face; the long, Tolkienesque beard and straggly hair; the khaki flak jacket and battered camera bag. </p> <p>He glances up with a suspicious scowl. </p> <p> The Observer : 'Mr Rockoff? Would you mind having a chat with The Observer ?' </p> <p>He would, mind, apparently. 'I'm a very private person. I'm just a photographer and I'm here taking pictures, not doing some journalism lark,' he growls. </p> <p> The Observer : 'Just interested to hear your view of what is likely to happen in Cambodia...' </p> <p>There is a moment when it looks as though he may use his camcorder as a cosh. Pause, sneer: 'I'm not a tour guide.' </p> <p>He's obviously not in the mood for talking of 'his Khmer Rouge days'. Fine. Forget it. There are many places where old war horses come, photographically, to die. Phnom Penh is definitely one of them.</p> <p><strong>Travel file</strong></p> <p>Joanna Walters travelled to Cambodia via Vietnam.

      "body": "<p><strong> Venus Beauty </strong> <br>(1998, 15, Tartan, VHS/Retail, rental) </p> <p>Written and directed by Tonie Marshall, this witty, touching adult movie is one of the best French pictures of the last few years. The beguiling Nathalie Baye plays Ang\u00e8le, a 40-year-old divorc\u00e9e, one of three assistants in a small Parisian beauty parlour, the V\u00e9nus Beaut\u00e9 salon, that pampers the faces and bodies of its mainly female patrons and hears their confessions. This comforting, pastel-coloured place that helps fight off the ravages of time is a haven from the harsh world outside, where the tough, promiscuous Ang\u00e8le goes from one bad relationship to another. Avoiding easy cynicism, the film has a warm, honest, realistic approach to life and relationships. It's excellently performed by Baye, Bulle Ogier (the salon's soign\u00e9e manager) and others, and among various guest appearances there's a charming contribution by the director's mother, the great Micheline Presle. </p> <p><strong> A Walk on the Moon</strong> <br> (1999, 15, Paramount, VHS/Rental) </p> <p>Produced by Dustin Hoffman, this fine directorial debut by actor Tony Goldwyn is set at a modest Jewish holiday resort in the Catskills where the mother, wife (Diane Lane), 14-year-daughter (Anna Paquin) and seven-year-old son of hard-working, frustrated New York television repair man (Liev Schreiber) are spending the summer of 1969. This is the year of the Apollo 11 moon landing and Woodstock, the time of the Vietnam War and its counterculture, and these events impinge on the family's life in funny, revealing and sometimes painful ways. Rarely contrived, only occasionally glib, this small gem of a movie is accurate in its evocation of the recent past and honest in its confronation of potentially tragic crises. </p> <p> <strong> Le Beau Serge </strong> <br>(1959, 12, Second Sight, VHS/Retail) </p> <p> With this milestone debut (largely financed by his wife), the 27-year-old Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma critic Claude Chabrol launched the French New Wave, and he immediately followed it with a companion piece Les Cousins , also released this week. In the first a Parisian student (Jean-Claude Brialy) returns to a bleak, acutely observed village to save a distressed, alcoholic boyhood friend (G\u00e9rard Blain). In the second - an erotic, highly mannered version of the town-mouse, country-mouse story - decent provincial lad Blain comes to study in Paris and falls under the baleful influence of Brialy, his sophisticated cousin. Both movies are photographed in black-and-white by Henri Deca\u00eb, a key New Wave figure who shot the first films of Louis Malle and Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut. </p> <p> <strong> The Searchers </strong> <br>(1956, PG, Warner, DVD/Retail) </p> <p>On DVD at last in the appropriately named Timeless Classics series, John Ford's initially derided Western is as towering as the buttes and mesas of Monument Valley that provide its setting. As the embittered Civil War veteran searching for his niece, kidnapped by the Indians, John Wayne gives his greatest performance and the movie has influenced people as different as Buddy Holly and Martin Scorsese.</p>",

Ingeniously, and with the polish of the most experienced corporate facilitator, in order to introduce us to Catharism, D.M. 'Call me Don' Thomas took on the mantle of a twelfth-century Cathar priest.

No, he just did everything in the manner of one, to get us into the swing of things. </p> <p>Not that it was particularly swinging, mind you. The Cathars believed in the dualism of good and evil.

Breakfasts were a good mix of virtuously healthy fruit salad, cereal and yoghurt with a coffee and pain au chocolat chaser. Lunch started with a delicious soup, and dinners ended with the most pleasing puddings, including some old Anglo-French favourites: chocolate mousse and banoffee pie. Local wine flowed. All meals were help-yourself style, and volunteers were welcomed to lay the tables and help with clearing up.

Thomas. At Easter, the weather hadn't quite got there, albeit for a couple of hot days when some of our party gathered around the pool on sun loungers with the languid ease of time-share veterans. Nevertheless, there were many opportunities to find a quiet spot - in a hammock, on a swing, or just in a patch of daisies - to muse, stare into space and scribble. When it rained, we huddled around a wood burner, ate creme eggs and tried our hand at albas, sestinas and villanelles, inspired by the trobadors and trobairitz, but also seeking help from the likes of Ezra Pound and Pushkin.

In the regional press, where more than 60 per cent of titles have one way or another changed ownership in the last five years, RIM is the last prize in the shop, and three companies have now joined the chase to buy its publisher. </p> <p>The acquisitive and vast American publisher Gannett lodged an application to purchase it with the Department of Trade and Industry last Wednesday. Two days later Johnston Press said it had done the same, and a similar statement will be made in the next two days by Trinity Mirror. With the three newspaper groups all besieging Trade Secretary Stephen Byers' in-tray with their requests, only the regional division of the Daily Mail and General Trust, Northcliffe Newspapers, has been spared the battle. It already has competing regional titles. </p> <p>With the communications white paper due in the autumn, the Government has a headache deciding whether to allow the consolidation bandwagon to roll through the regional press - particularly as local papers, like local TV franchises, are incredibly important to many of its own backbenchers. </p> <p>With the five remaining players in the regional newspaper market seemingly poised to shrink to four - and one of them a US operation - the regional press has evolved a long way from the locally-based groups, often family-owned, enterprises of the past. </p> <p>'You've got to expect, even at this stage, that a player of Gannett's size, which has already bought both Newsquest and Newscom Groups, will either look for a further purchase or for an exit, even if it buys RIM too,' says one media analyst. 'All these companies see regional newspapers as a means of generating online profits from existing cash cows.' </p> <p>It is an outcome very few would have predicted when Candover, the venture capitalists, paid what at the time seemed a punishingly high price of \u00a3360m for the papers owned by United News and Media when it decided to sell out of the stodgy regionals market in 1998. </p> <p>Much to the surprise perhaps of established media companies such as Pearson and Emap, which also took a strategic and early exit from the regional press, the value of these newspaper assets has soared as the industry consolidated and the number of groups available to purchase dropped. </p> <p>RIM is said to harbour private expectations that the company could be worth as much as \u00a3650m if it went ahead with a planned stock market flotation. This is probably a bit over-optimistic with the group's most recent annual profits of just \u00a323m . But somewhere in the three-way bidding, the price of the papers could still reach a respectable figure of between \u00a3500m and \u00a3550m. </p> <p> Candover, which owns 51 per cent of the company, seems to have played a very canny game. It started out from being in a position, two years ago, where most industry observers thought it had hideously overpaid for its stake. Biding its time while independent press groups have been snapped up, it has made RIM far more attractive because it is the last available asset. </p> <p>But while most people think of their local paper as the repository for such vital information as the timing of the next church fete and the availability of second-hand three-piece suites, their place in the new economy is making the industry's consolidation look financially very attractive. </p> <p>'We gather and store information digitally - we just distribute it via paper. In the future that may change', says RIM chief executive Chris Oakley, 'Our internet revenues are around \u00a32m a year now. In five years I'm sure the majority of our revenues will still come from newspapers, but the proportion will gradually change. It is possible to foresee a time when online revenues will outweigh paper revenues.' </p> <p>This is a surprise coming amid the cratering of confidence, particularly in content-driven internet businesses, but Oakley believes that the mix of proprietary local information and advertising coupled with newspaper brands means that estab lished newspaper companies can be confidence in their online investment strategies eventually paying dividends. </p> <p>'Those established companies who are looking at online as a way of extending their brands and improving distribution are on to a winner; spending a fortune to establish new brands probably won't make a success of it.' </p> <p>But in gathering these vast tracts of digital information and increasingly pushing editorial functions away from local towns and into regional centres, is the industry serving its shareholders better, but letting down its readership? </p> <p>Hardly surprisingly, Oakley thinks not: 'I would say that there has been a vast improvement in most of the local and regional press over the past 15 years, largely due to the consolidation process. The quality of production is higher, the centralisation of business has allowed us, for the first time, to compete for advertising on a national level and the editorial is at least as good, or in some cases better, than it was.' </p> <p>The Government is un likely to bail out the local newspaper office as a dying craft.

      "body": "<p>You could almost have set your watch by it. Barely 25 minutes after Southend's pubs started calling time on Friday's shift of revellers, the first shout came over the police radio: youths were reported trying to break into a shop. Squads of lads had had just enough time to swill down the remains of their fizzy Carlsbergs, wipe the dribbles off the front of their carefully untucked shirts and stagger off along the seafront in search of drunken sustenance. Now it was time for lager-fuelled high jinks.</p> <p>The Ford Mondeo driven by PC Mick Taylor reached the shop, a half-mile from the town centre, in a couple of minutes, joining three other patrol cars which had raced to the scene. The four lads in question, all in their early twenties, were not only still there, but very drunk and unhappy with the sudden and dramatic attention. For a moment it looked as if though things would turn ugly, but after a few minutes of quiet questioning from Taylor, the tension was replaced by joking as it became clear that the youths had not been trying to burgle the unlikely target of an 'everything for \u00a31' shop.</p> <p>'We were just waiting on our pizza and we started having a larking-around fight,' explained Neil, the mouthiest of the group. 'We were rolling about making a racket, and we maybe banged into the shop doors a couple of times. Then, the next thing we are surrounded by four cop cars.'</p> <p>It was the sort of minor incident played out in every town centre in Britain every Friday and Saturday night. In this case, it ended with matey handshakes all round before the lads were left to their pizza. But if Tony Blair has his way, the likes of Neil and his mates could find themselves being marched off to the cash machine at the nearest bank for money to pay a \u00a3100 on-the-spot fine for their loutish behaviour.</p> <p>In a speech to 1,000 students in the German town of T\u00fcbingen last week, the Prime Minister announced this latest idea to crack down on the tide of anti-social behaviour, usually drink-related, which causes 'offence and misery in too many towns and cities on too many Friday and Saturday nights'.</p> <p>'A thug,' he said, 'might think twice about kicking in your gate, throwing traffic cones around your street or hurling abuse into the night sky if he thought he might get picked up by the police, taken to a cashpoint and asked to pay an on-the-spot fine.'</p> <p>Blair believes it is perverse that hard-pushed front line police officers should have the power to fine people who park illegally, but can deal with loutish drunks only through a 'long, expensive process through the police station, courts and beyond'.</p> <p>If the idea was meant to be the answer to the Government's sensitivities on law and order, it immediately backfired. Senior police officers and lawyers were puzzled about why he chose to drop what is being widely dismissed as a gimmick into a highbrow speech on community ethics and the value of religious faith in modern society. The most obvious theory is that Blair is desperate to be seen to be taking the initiative on law and order ahead of the publication on 18 July of new crime figures which are expected to be bad.</p> <p>While burglary and car crime will show another fall, violence against the person is expected to show a double-figure increase. The political logic is simple: behind the twitching curtains of suburban Britain, the feeling is that yobbery is on the march, unchecked by a lily-livered Government. So what better, or cheaper, way to reclaim the law and order initiative agenda than by tossing the tabloids the juicy bone of summary justice?</p> <p>It is not difficult to understand Ministers' reluctance to unleash more gloomy results on a public which already suspects that new Labour is starting to lose its grip on crime. The Government was startled by the row over rural crime sparked by the case of Tony Martin, the Norfolk farmer convicted of the murder of a 16-year-old intruder. Then came the ugly antics of England football hooligans in Belgium for Euro 2000.</p> <p>Blair's choice of Germany to air his plan shows how keen he is to re-establish his Government's damaged reputation with the British public and of his European partners.</p> <p>The reality on the ground is more complicated, and adds weight to complaints that he is pandering to little more than an unsubstantiated fear of thuggery stalking the country.</p> <p>No separate figures are available for loutish behaviour, whether caused by drink or not, so it is impossible to tell the scale of the problem.</p> <p>The one area which Blair seems to have in mind, and for which statistics are available, is criminal damage. Yet even there, the evidence runs against his argument. The last crime figures, released last October, show a 3.2 per cent fall for this offence.</p> <p>Only 11 per cent of the 879,600 incidents in the 12 months up to March 1999 involved damage to objects such as bus shelters and telephone kiosks.</p> <p>But it is places such as Southend that are the true test. The Essex resort is famous for two things: its pier and its louts. With more than 400 licenced premises attracting a heady mix of locals and day-trippers every weekend, trouble is likely any weekend.</p> <p>'We have pubs chucking out from 11pm and the clubs going through until 2am,' said Inspector Howard Laverack, the officer in charge of Friday's night shift. 'That means we get problems with people having too much to drink or being under the influence of drugs, which can affect their behaviour. Some Friday and Saturday nights can be bloody horrendous.'</p> <p>Even here, however, Blair can count on little support. 'I can see where he's coming from,' said Laverack. 'But I can't see how we could give an on-the spot fine to somebody misbehaving because they are drunk or on drugs, or both, because they are impossible to deal with, especially if they offer violence.</p> <p>It not just police who are unimpressed. Friday night in Southend was quiet, but the atmosphere was still tense. Trouble never seemed far away, especially when the clubs started emptying drink- and often drug-filled customers into the street.</p> <p>Lee Phypes, head doorman at Papillon's bar on the seafront for eight years, expects trouble every weekend. A few weeks ago, a drunk came at him with an ashtray and on a few memorable occasions in the past, huge mass fights have erupted between members of drunken coach parties.</p> <p>Even he sees little point in giving police the new power. 'It would be a waste of time. We deal with the stuff that happens inside, they deal with it when it's outside. They would never use fines because it would be more hassle.'</p> <p>Papillon's punters agreed. 'You get trouble down here quite a lot,' said Paul Horwood, 18, who was in town for a night out with three mates from east London.</p> <p>'Some people come looking for trouble but usually they're just pissed up, and they are not going to be thinking about fines or anything.'</p> <p>A little before 2am and PC Taylor and his partner, Gary Watts, have made their third tour round the near-deserted town centre streets. As they cruised past Tots, a gleaming, neon-spangled nightclub above the seafront, a drunken young woman spotted the car and unleashed a loud barrage of abuse.

      "bodyText": "You could almost have set your watch by it. Barely 25 minutes after Southend's pubs started calling time on Friday's shift of revellers, the first shout came over the police radio: youths were reported trying to break into a shop. Squads of lads had had just enough time to swill down the remains of their fizzy Carlsbergs, wipe the dribbles off the front of their carefully untucked shirts and stagger off along the seafront in search of drunken sustenance. Now it was time for lager-fuelled high jinks. The Ford Mondeo driven by PC Mick Taylor reached the shop, a half-mile from the town centre, in a couple of minutes, joining three other patrol cars which had raced to the scene. The four lads in question, all in their early twenties, were not only still there, but very drunk and unhappy with the sudden and dramatic attention. For a moment it looked as if though things would turn ugly, but after a few minutes of quiet questioning from Taylor, the tension was replaced by joking as it became clear that the youths had not been trying to burgle the unlikely target of an 'everything for \u00a31' shop. 'We were just waiting on our pizza and we started having a larking-around fight,' explained Neil, the mouthiest of the group. 'We were rolling about making a racket, and we maybe banged into the shop doors a couple of times. Then, the next thing we are surrounded by four cop cars.' It was the sort of minor incident played out in every town centre in Britain every Friday and Saturday night. In this case, it ended with matey handshakes all round before the lads were left to their pizza. But if Tony Blair has his way, the likes of Neil and his mates could find themselves being marched off to the cash machine at the nearest bank for money to pay a \u00a3100 on-the-spot fine for their loutish behaviour. In a speech to 1,000 students in the German town of T\u00fcbingen last week, the Prime Minister announced this latest idea to crack down on the tide of anti-social behaviour, usually drink-related, which causes 'offence and misery in too many towns and cities on too many Friday and Saturday nights'. 'A thug,' he said, 'might think twice about kicking in your gate, throwing traffic cones around your street or hurling abuse into the night sky if he thought he might get picked up by the police, taken to a cashpoint and asked to pay an on-the-spot fine.' Blair believes it is perverse that hard-pushed front line police officers should have the power to fine people who park illegally, but can deal with loutish drunks only through a 'long, expensive process through the police station, courts and beyond'. If the idea was meant to be the answer to the Government's sensitivities on law and order, it immediately backfired. Senior police officers and lawyers were puzzled about why he chose to drop what is being widely dismissed as a gimmick into a highbrow speech on community ethics and the value of religious faith in modern society. The most obvious theory is that Blair is desperate to be seen to be taking the initiative on law and order ahead of the publication on 18 July of new crime figures which are expected to be bad. While burglary and car crime will show another fall, violence against the person is expected to show a double-figure increase. The political logic is simple: behind the twitching curtains of suburban Britain, the feeling is that yobbery is on the march, unchecked by a lily-livered Government. So what better, or cheaper, way to reclaim the law and order initiative agenda than by tossing the tabloids the juicy bone of summary justice? It is not difficult to understand Ministers' reluctance to unleash more gloomy results on a public which already suspects that new Labour is starting to lose its grip on crime. The Government was startled by the row over rural crime sparked by the case of Tony Martin, the Norfolk farmer convicted of the murder of a 16-year-old intruder. Then came the ugly antics of England football hooligans in Belgium for Euro 2000. Blair's choice of Germany to air his plan shows how keen he is to re-establish his Government's damaged reputation with the British public and of his European partners. The reality on the ground is more complicated, and adds weight to complaints that he is pandering to little more than an unsubstantiated fear of thuggery stalking the country. No separate figures are available for loutish behaviour, whether caused by drink or not, so it is impossible to tell the scale of the problem. The one area which Blair seems to have in mind, and for which statistics are available, is criminal damage. Yet even there, the evidence runs against his argument. The last crime figures, released last October, show a 3.2 per cent fall for this offence. Only 11 per cent of the 879,600 incidents in the 12 months up to March 1999 involved damage to objects such as bus shelters and telephone kiosks. But it is places such as Southend that are the true test. The Essex resort is famous for two things: its pier and its louts. With more than 400 licenced premises attracting a heady mix of locals and day-trippers every weekend, trouble is likely any weekend. 'We have pubs chucking out from 11pm and the clubs going through until 2am,' said Inspector Howard Laverack, the officer in charge of Friday's night shift. 'That means we get problems with people having too much to drink or being under the influence of drugs, which can affect their behaviour. Some Friday and Saturday nights can be bloody horrendous.' Even here, however, Blair can count on little support. 'I can see where he's coming from,' said Laverack. 'But I can't see how we could give an on-the spot fine to somebody misbehaving because they are drunk or on drugs, or both, because they are impossible to deal with, especially if they offer violence. It not just police who are unimpressed. Friday night in Southend was quiet, but the atmosphere was still tense. Trouble never seemed far away, especially when the clubs started emptying drink- and often drug-filled customers into the street. Lee Phypes, head doorman at Papillon's bar on the seafront for eight years, expects trouble every weekend. A few weeks ago, a drunk came at him with an ashtray and on a few memorable occasions in the past, huge mass fights have erupted between members of drunken coach parties. Even he sees little point in giving police the new power. 'It would be a waste of time. We deal with the stuff that happens inside, they deal with it when it's outside. They would never use fines because it would be more hassle.' Papillon's punters agreed. 'You get trouble down here quite a lot,' said Paul Horwood, 18, who was in town for a night out with three mates from east London. 'Some people come looking for trouble but usually they're just pissed up, and they are not going to be thinking about fines or anything.' A little before 2am and PC Taylor and his partner, Gary Watts, have made their third tour round the near-deserted town centre streets. As they cruised past Tots, a gleaming, neon-spangled nightclub above the seafront, a drunken young woman spotted the car and unleashed a loud barrage of abuse. The officers shook their heads and drove on. 'That's a classic example of why this idea won't work,' said Taylor. 'We could have stopped her but that could have been like sending up a rocket so what would be the point of trying to fine her? We already have the powers we need, it just comes down to practical policing and how we use our judgment.' Watts agreed: 'If you asked the British public what they wanted the police to sort out first, I would say burglary was a bigger priority.' Just then, another emergency call came over the radio. A member of the public had reported seeing a handgun in a black Jaguar driven by four young men on the seafront. As the officers joined the operation to stop it, Taylor remarked wryly: 'Now that's a bit more serious than somebody chucking a traffic cone around and shouting.' stuart.millar@observer.co.uk",

      "bodyText": "James Brown I'm reading Slow Down Arthur, Stick to Thirty by Harland Miller. It's a very accurate report of inner-city speed and dole life. I'm also going to be reading Nothing by Paul Morley, a pretty moving account of how he came to terms with his father's death. I just think he is a quite unique voice and it is a very common story, people's parents dying young. Allegra McEvedy I'm going to be reading The Wind-up Bird Chronicle by Haruki Murakami. It is kind of magical realism: Raymond Carver meets Thomas Pynchon, about a man who sees things and has a wife who misbehaves. Nothing really makes sense and it leaves you hanging with lots of questions. Richard Eyre I shall be reading Martin Amis's Experience. Partly because I was taught by his father and partly because I find father-son relationships fascinating. I'll also read Graham Robb's biography of Victor Hugo. And I'm planning on reading all the novels of Iris Murdoch. Marika Cobbold I've just got The Human Stain by Philip Roth. I loved his American Pastoral and I Married A Communist. He is a writer of vision, passion and humanity. I'm also going to read All That Really Matters by Campbell Armstrong. It's a heart-wrenching and uplifting memoir of marriage, loss and redemption.

Otherwise it'll be manuscripts mostly, especially The Neal Pollack Anthology of American Literature. After that, any spare time will be given, wholly, to pornography. Auberon Waugh I'll be taking Malcolm Bradbury's To the Hermitage on holiday, which is the funniest book ever written, and I'm also taking V.S. Naipaul's Reading and Writing because he's just excellent. Ian McEwan I'm going to Spain for my holidays so I'll take some Lorca and Michael Frayn's Towards the End of Morning which has been reissued. I'll also be taking a preview copy of Julian Barnes's novel Love Etc which isn't published until August, plus Colin Tudge's The Variety of Life which is a celebration of all the creatures that have ever lived.

Most hard-bitten journalists backed West Indies. With the help of Dominic Cork, we scraped home. </p> <p>The drizzle that held up play for 50 minutes brought a false sense of security. Perhaps it wouldn't be so hard after all. Yet when reality intervened, it was business as usual. In the 40 minutes of play before drizzle caused an early lunch, Ambrose bowled 36 balls, almost all of them to Atherton, who eked out a meagre one run for a little push past silly mid-on. Apart from this, he went past the outside edge perhaps ten times. </p> <p>At the other end Ramprakash at least got off the mark, off the outside part of the bat, through gully. I felt for him. He is a tense man, as well as an engaging one. I imagine from his recent play that he is in torment about it. He must get conflicting advice: 'Get your head down, this is your chance,' alternating with 'Relax. Imagine it's a county match. Think positive.' </p> <p>He must wonder whether to look to get forward on these recent testing pitches, at Edgbaston and at Lord's, or back. If he tries hard to protect against outswing he over-adjusts, gets his leg too far over, and is liable to be lbw or caught off bat and pad (these being his dismissals at Edgbaston): when he readjusts he risks being caught at slip, as in the first innings here. </p> <p>Yesterday he seemed to jump excitedly at a looser ball from Walsh, jerkily, not letting it come to him. The result was a crooked bat, and an inside edge on to the stumps. For his peace of mind, he needs to be left out. The contrast with Atherton, who had up to then been frequently all at sea against Ambrose, was revealed next over, when he hit an identical ball for four between gully and cover. </p> <p>I thought that England made a selection error for this match. When Nasser Hussain had to pull out I thought we needed Graham Thorpe. He is capable of scoring off decent balls and is quick to latch on to the short ball, pulling with a tough quickness of eye and wrist, like the other left- handers Border, Langer and Lara. This ability forces the bowlers to pitch the ball up further. They also have to change their line for the left hander. </p> <p>I would have brought him in for Ramprakash from the start. We shouldn't have hung about. But when Nasser dropped out, I was even more convinced that we had to pick Thorpe; we were asking for trouble to enter such a key match with three untried batsmen in the first five. Why have the scores been so sensationally low here? Since tea on day one, when West Indies were 170 for two, 285 runs had been scored by Friday night for the loss of 27 wickets. No one reached 30. What on earth happened? The ball has gone through quicker as the match has gone on, and deviated in the air and off the dead tufty grass. </p> <p>The main change came in England's approach in the second innings. Someone obviously decided that the thing to do was to bang the ball in. This they did with transforming effect on Friday, in one of the most enthralling sessions of cricket I can remember. Caddick was, in Michael Slater's epithet, awesome. No longer merely the rigid guardsman, he ran in with menace. </p> <p>Stewart gave him good fields; he was lucky to get Campbell, caught at third man, but the fielder had rapidly been deployed there, a case of luck partly earned. </p> <p>To the left handers he placed two short legs, giving the bowler permission to bowl straight rather than wide of off stump, and shorter than usual. </p> <p>Caddick has the astonishing statistic of averaging 36 in the first innings of Test cricket, and 18 in the second. This raises questions about nerves. </p> <p>At Friday's play, Graham Gooch suggested to the openers that they find some way of disrupting the composure of Ambrose and Walsh. The England bowlers needed to rough them up, give them a dose of their own old medicine. ('Make him swallow the ball, Malcolm,' was one encouragement for the bats man in the days of Marshall). On the other hand, it was in the interest of West Indies to keep to their length and line. How they were to be riled was not revealed. Verbal nastiness was not, I imagine, what Gooch had in mind, but nor perhaps was running down the wicket as Brian Close did against Wes Hall in the amazing match at Lord's in 1963. </p> <p>In fact we were incredibly lucky yesterday against Ambrose.

Right-wing conservatives inside the Curia, the Vatican's administration, are believed to have championed the beatification in defiance of warnings that it would rupture Jewish-Catholic relations. Pius IX was a courageous opponent and victim of nineteenth-century anti-clericalism, they claim. But critics say he is being championed only to balance the simultaneous beatification of John XXIII, a reforming pope beloved by liberals.</p> <p>Under Pius IX, laws were passed banning Jews from secondary and higher education, limiting their employment and property rights and invalidating their evidence in court.</p> <p>The last pope-king, who reigned from 1846 to 1878, is most notorious for kidnapping. The most sensational case occurred in Bologna, then a papal state, when police snatched six-year-old Edgardo Mortara from his Jewish parents and seven siblings. Four years earlier he had had a fever and a servant girl had sprinkled water on his head in case he died.</p> <p>Edgardo was declared subject to canon law, which required the Church to take religious charge of any person baptised. His parents never saw him again, despite international lobbying for his return. Edgardo was effectively adopted as a son by Pius IX and became a priest. He died in Belgium in 1940, a disturbed man, according to his diaries.</p> <p>Jewish leaders held a conference in Rome last week to register their anger. Two decades of efforts by the current Pope to improve Vatican-Jewish relations were imperilled, they said. The Mortara case 'is the biggest wound that remains in the Italian Jewish world ... that still hasn't scarred over,' said Amos Luzzatto, president of the Union of Italian Jewish Communities. 'It is a fact that the name of Pius IX is associated among Jews with the sad memory of Jewish children baptised against the will of their parents.'</p> <p>Echoing dismay from American Jewish groups, Richard Heideman, president of B'nai B'rith International, has written a protest letter to the Vatican congregation responsible for beatifications.</p> <p>Elan Steinberg, of the World Jewish Congress, was puzzled why a Pope who recently prayed at the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem and apologised for centuries of persecution should now undermine Jewish-Catholic reconciliation. 'We have a paradox here,' she said.</p> <p>A proposal to beatify Pius IX in 1985 was shelved after two senior cardinals and official biographers suggested he was unsuitable. It was not for the Jewish people to tell the Vatican who to make a saint, but the Mortara case went 'right to the heart of religious tolerance', said Steinberg.</p> <p>Israel has not officially complained because it is saving its fire for the bigger battle over the possible beatification of Pius XII, who remained silent about the Holocaust during the Second World War, said one diplomat.</p> <p>Meanwhile, one of Irish-Americans' most senior lobbyists in Washington has launched a coast-to-coast campaign against Pius IX's beatification. Father Sean McManus, a Catholic priest and leading figure in the Irish National Caucus, has called on Irish-Americans to put pressure on bishops and cardinals in the United States to persuade the Vatican to reverse its decision.</p> <p>Under pressure from Britain's then Prime Minister, William Gladstone, Pius IX excommunicated the Fenians from the Catholic Church on 12 January, 1870. At the time the Fenians were en-gaged in acts of violence in both Ireland and Britain. In devoutly Catholic Ireland, the excommunication order effectively killed off any popular support for the revolutionary republican organisation.</p> <p>McManus said he had no problem reconciling his Catholicism and his overall loyalty to the present Pope John II with his opposition to Pius IX becoming a saint.</p> <p>'A great injustice was done against the Fenian movement by excommunicating them,' he said. 'The main reason I am opposing this beatification is hypocrisy. The Fenians were excommunicated because they used violence, but Pius IX also used violence.</p> <p>'Pius IX had a standing army and used it to maintain the temporal power of the Vatican State. He even called for Irish volunteers to fight in the Papal Army against the troops of the Carbonari.'</p>",

But critics say he is being championed only to balance the simultaneous beatification of John XXIII, a reforming pope beloved by liberals. Under Pius IX, laws were passed banning Jews from secondary and higher education, limiting their employment and property rights and invalidating their evidence in court. The last pope-king, who reigned from 1846 to 1878, is most notorious for kidnapping. The most sensational case occurred in Bologna, then a papal state, when police snatched six-year-old Edgardo Mortara from his Jewish parents and seven siblings. Four years earlier he had had a fever and a servant girl had sprinkled water on his head in case he died. Edgardo was declared subject to canon law, which required the Church to take religious charge of any person baptised. His parents never saw him again, despite international lobbying for his return. Edgardo was effectively adopted as a son by Pius IX and became a priest. He died in Belgium in 1940, a disturbed man, according to his diaries. Jewish leaders held a conference in Rome last week to register their anger. Two decades of efforts by the current Pope to improve Vatican-Jewish relations were imperilled, they said. The Mortara case 'is the biggest wound that remains in the Italian Jewish world ... that still hasn't scarred over,' said Amos Luzzatto, president of the Union of Italian Jewish Communities. 'It is a fact that the name of Pius IX is associated among Jews with the sad memory of Jewish children baptised against the will of their parents.' Echoing dismay from American Jewish groups, Richard Heideman, president of B'nai B'rith International, has written a protest letter to the Vatican congregation responsible for beatifications. Elan Steinberg, of the World Jewish Congress, was puzzled why a Pope who recently prayed at the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem and apologised for centuries of persecution should now undermine Jewish-Catholic reconciliation. 'We have a paradox here,' she said. A proposal to beatify Pius IX in 1985 was shelved after two senior cardinals and official biographers suggested he was unsuitable. It was not for the Jewish people to tell the Vatican who to make a saint, but the Mortara case went 'right to the heart of religious tolerance', said Steinberg. Israel has not officially complained because it is saving its fire for the bigger battle over the possible beatification of Pius XII, who remained silent about the Holocaust during the Second World War, said one diplomat. Meanwhile, one of Irish-Americans' most senior lobbyists in Washington has launched a coast-to-coast campaign against Pius IX's beatification. Father Sean McManus, a Catholic priest and leading figure in the Irish National Caucus, has called on Irish-Americans to put pressure on bishops and cardinals in the United States to persuade the Vatican to reverse its decision. Under pressure from Britain's then Prime Minister, William Gladstone, Pius IX excommunicated the Fenians from the Catholic Church on 12 January, 1870. At the time the Fenians were en-gaged in acts of violence in both Ireland and Britain. In devoutly Catholic Ireland, the excommunication order effectively killed off any popular support for the revolutionary republican organisation. McManus said he had no problem reconciling his Catholicism and his overall loyalty to the present Pope John II with his opposition to Pius IX becoming a saint. 'A great injustice was done against the Fenian movement by excommunicating them,' he said. 'The main reason I am opposing this beatification is hypocrisy. The Fenians were excommunicated because they used violence, but Pius IX also used violence. 'Pius IX had a standing army and used it to maintain the temporal power of the Vatican State. He even called for Irish volunteers to fight in the Papal Army against the troops of the Carbonari.'",

When will people catch on to the subtle delights of mature Amontillado Sherry? This deliciously nutty, dry, full-bodied fortified is a super example of the Andalusian alchemy which turns the boring Palomino grape into one of the world's great wines. </p> <p><strong> 1999 Corbi\u00e8res, Domaine Madelon</strong> (\u00a33.69, Majestic). I've tried a lot of southern French reds under \u00a34 and this one still comes out ahead. It's soft, fleshy and deeply coloured with notes of black pepper, liquorice, blackberries and sweet plums. The tannins are very smooth for a wine at this price. </p> <p><strong> 1999 Canepa S\u00e9millon, Colchagua</strong> (\u00a33.99, Unwins, Fullers, Waitrose). S\u00e9millon is an unusual variety to find in Chile, where Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay are the grape varieties of choice. This lemony, pleasantly herbal white has medium-to-full body, refreshing acidity and an enticing finish. </p> <p><strong> 1999 Riverview Sauvignon Blanc, Neszm\u00e9ly</strong> (\u00a33.99, Safeway). If anyone is making a better value Sauvignon Blanc than this Hungarian stunner, then I'd love to see it. Grass and grapefruit are the dominant flavours in this intense, well-balanced white from ace winemaker, Akos Kamocsay. </p> <p><strong> 1999 La Palmeria Merlot</strong> (from \u00a34.49, Oddbins, Unwins, Fullers). This deeply coloured, fleshy Chilean Merlot has sweet blackcurrant fruit, succulent tannins and a touch of vanilla oak. </p> <p><strong> 1999 Cuv\u00e9e de l'Arjolle Ros\u00e9, Vin de Pays des Ctes de Thongue</strong> (\u00a34.95, Justerini &amp; Brooks, 020 7493 8721). Summer is a great time to drink ros\u00e9 and this dry southern French example is absolutely delicious. It's refreshing, but also has plenty of rosehip and strawberry fruit concentration. </p> <p><strong> 1999 Argento Malbec</strong> (\u00a34.99, Sainsbury's, Tesco, Wine Rack, Bottoms Up, Thresher, Victoria Wine, Wine Cellar). Still the best value Argentine red on the market, this sumptuously packaged Malbec from one of South America's leading producers continues to impress with its richness and its plummy, oak-influenced concentration and its drinkability. </p> <p><strong> 1999 Tesco Chilean Cabernet Sauvignon Reserve, Curic\u00f3</strong> (\u00a34.99, Tesco). Tesco's own-label Chilean reds are excellent value and this Cabernet from Valdivieso is the best of the lot. It's minty and intense with finely textured tannins and flavours of currant and fresh blackcurrant offset by subtle oak. </p> <p><strong> 1998 L'Arco Friuli Cabernet Franc</strong> (\u00a34.99, Somerfield). London-based Aussie John Worontschak is the man behind this impressive north-east Italian red. Made from the Loire Valley's Cabernet Franc grape, it's grassy and soft with classic notes of green pepper and pencil shavings. </p> <p><strong> 1998 Vouvray Hand-Picked, Denis Marchais</strong> (\u00a34.99, Asda). Chenin Blanc can taste of apple cores when badly made, but this medium-sweet wine shows the variety's more attractive side. It's crisp and honeyed with flavours of Cox's apple and pear. </p> <p><strong> 1999 Rock Ridge Chardonnay, Vinfruco</strong> (\u00a34.99, Marks &amp; Spencer). South African Chardonnay is improving with every vintage and can now compete with Australia under \u00a35. Werner Engelbrecht's toasty, well-balanced, subtly oaked white is distinguished by the ripeness and purity of its fruit. </p> <p><strong> 1994 Bernkasteler Badstube Riesling Kabinett, Sanctus Jacobus</strong> (\u00a34.99, Majestic). A great follow up to the 1990 vintage. Fresh and extremely light on the palate with notes of apple and lime blossom, this is a great introduction to off-dry Mosel Riesling. </p> <p> <strong> Under \u00a310 </strong></p> <p><strong> 1999 Santa Digna Sauvignon Blanc, Miguel Torres, Curic\u00f3</strong> (\u00a35.49, Selfridges; 01442 870 900). Miguel Torres is more commonly associated with Spain than Chile, but the wines he's producing in the Curic\u00f3 Valley are outstanding. This rich, concentrated, almost tropical Sauvignon Blanc could easily be mistaken for a top Kiwi white. </p> <p><strong> 1998 Landskroon Shiraz, Paarl</strong> (\u00a36.49, Safeway). This well-priced Shiraz is spicy and smooth, with powerful blackberry and raspberry fruit flavours and vanilla sweetness from American-oak ageing. </p> <p><strong> 1999 Anjou, Domaine Ogereau</strong> (\u00a36.99, Swig, 020 7431 4412). Youthful Loire reds are ideal for summer drinking, especially if they're chilled. This perfumed Cabernet Franc has got surprising depth and concentration, with flavours of cassis and green pepper and medium tannins. </p> <p><strong> 1999 Pazo de Se\u00f1orans Albari\u00f1o, Rias Baixas</strong> (from \u00a37.95, Tanners, 01743 234 500; Harvey Nichols; Valvona &amp; Crolla, 0131 556 6066). The wines from Spain's Atlantic coast are some of the most underrated in Europe. This subtle unoaked white, with its understated flavours of peach and apricot and its zesty acidity is ideal summer drinking. </p> <p><strong> 1997 Chianti Classico, Il Tarocco</strong> (\u00a37.99, Oddbins). From a great Tuscan vintage, it's a blend of 90 per cent Sangiovese and 10 per cent Canaiolo with well-balanced oak, pronounced acidity, intense cherry fruit and a classic, almond finish. Needs food. </p> <p><strong> 1999 Capel Vale Verdelho, Western Australia</strong> (\u00a37.99, Majestic; \u00a36.99 if you buy two or more bottles). A brilliant western Australian take on a classic Madeira grape. This is extremely lively with floral aromas, crisp natural acidity and flavours of lime and guava. The oak is so subtle. Delicious. </p> <p><strong> 1998 Pinot Grigio Benefizium Porer, Lageder</strong> (\u00a38.49, Majestic; Bibendum, 020 7722 5577). All too often insipid, Italian Pinot Grigio is capable of great intensity in the right area. This example from the best producer in the Alto Adige is soft and peachy with great concentration and super palate length. </p> <p><strong> 1997 JJ Pr\u00fcm Riesling Kabinett</strong> (\u00a38.90, Justerini &amp; Brooks, 020 7493 8721). Pr\u00fcm is one of my desert-island producers, fashioning Mosel Rieslings of feline subtlety and elegance. This is a near perfect example of a Kabinett-style with lovely balance between sugar, acidity and fruit. </p> <p><strong> 1999 Pisano Tannat, RPF</strong> (\u00a38.99, Waitrose). Daniel Pisano makes Uruguay's best red wines. This well-structured Tannat is much softer than the examples you find in Madiran, the grape's other home, with flavours of mulberry, cherry and chocolate. </p> <p><strong> 1998 Gr\u00fcner Veltliner, Alte Reben, Oberfeld, Dr Unger</strong> (\u00a39.40, Morris &amp; Verdin, 020 7357 8866). Austria produces some of Europe's most exciting whites. This intense (and for Austria, underpriced) white is overtly spicy with flamboyant flavours of grapefruit and bay leaf. </p> <p><strong> 1998 Tim Adams, The Fergus, Clare Valley</strong> (\u00a39.99, Wine Rack, Bottoms Up, Australian Wine Club, 0800 856 2004). Tim Adams is one of my favourite Aussie producers. This Grenache-based Clare Valley blend is one of the mintiest wines I've ever tasted, showing spicy oak, ripe tannins and lush flavours of strawberry and brown sugar. </p> <p><strong> 1999 Kuentz-Bas Alsace Gew\u00fcrztraminer Collection</strong> (\u00a39.99, Unwins, Fuller's). Alsace Gew\u00fcrztraminer can be a bit of a one-glass wine, but this is an exception. It's got the classic lychee and rose-petal aromas, but the wine is dry and extremely well-balanced. </p> <p> <strong> Under \u00a320 </strong></p> <p><strong> 1998 Glazebrook Merlot/Cabernet, Hawkes Bay</strong> (\u00a310.99, Roberson's, 020 7371 2121; Swig, 020 7431 4412). 1998 was a fantastic vintage for red wines in New Zealand, so it's no surprise that Hawkes Bay (the best area for Bordeaux blends) came up trumps. Alwyn Corban's blend of Merlot and Cabernet is a delicious alternative to top claret. </p> <p><strong> 1997 Von Blauem Schiefer, Heymann-L\u00f6wenstein, Mosel</strong> (\u00a311.80, Morris &amp; Verdin, 020 7357 8866). Most dry German whites are barely drinkable, but the wines from Heymann-L\u00f6wenstein are simply stunning. This green-tinged, medium-bodied Riesling is beautifully balanced with flavours of ripe apple and passion fruit. </p> <p><strong> 1997 Rosso Conero, Sassi Neri</strong> (\u00a312.45, Berry Brothers &amp; Rudd, 0870 900 4300). Top-notch Montepulciano from the Marches, showing intense colour, a vibrant, attractively oaked nose, rich tannins and flavours of currant, plum and black cherry. </p> <p><strong> 1998 Domaine Borie de Maurel, Cuv\u00e9e Sylla, Minervois</strong> (\u00a312.99, Oddbins). Languedoc reds don't get much better than this. The nose is massively concentrated with aromas of herbs, spices and ripe blackberry. Will improve for five to 10 years. </p> <p><strong> 1997 Chorey Les Beaune, Tollot Beaut</strong> (\u00a313.65, Berry Brothers &amp; Rudd, 0870 900 4300). Not a great vintage in Burgundy, but this Pinot Noir is drinking beautifully now. Fragrant with notes of raspberry and wild strawberry and attractive oak flavours. </p> <p><strong> Mavrodaphne of Patras, Karelas</strong> (\u00a313.95, Orchard Hive and Vine, 01568 611 232). Discovered by an Observer reader, this 50-year-old Greek sweet wine is one of the best things I've tasted in years. Rich and full-bodied with hints of prune and leather. </p> <p><strong> 1997 Coldstream Hills Reserve Chardonnay</strong> (\u00a314.99, Oddbins). Cool-climate Aussie Chardonnay has improved dramatically in the past five years, typified by the advances at Coldstream Hills in the Yarra Valley. A very complex wine with notes of toast, butter and fudge underscored by acidity. </p> <p><strong> 1998 Tokay Pinot-Gris Grand Cru, Sonnenglanz, Bott-Geyl</strong> (\u00a314.99, Majestic). Top Alsace wines are some of France's finest whites. This rich Pinot Gris from a Grand Cru site is soft and spicy with flavours of peach, melon and fennel. </p> <p><strong> 1996 Quinta do Portal Grande Reserva</strong> (\u00a315.95, Great Northern Wine Company, 01765 606 767; Ellis of Richmond, 020 8943 4033; Great Western Wine Company, 01225 322 800); Charles Hennings, 01798 872 485). French consultant Michel Rolland had a hand in this exciting Douro red made principally from Touriga Nacional grapes. This is peppery and intense with sweet fruit flavours. <strong> 1992 Tokaji Aszu, 5 Puttonyos, Disznoko</strong> (\u00a315.99 per 50cl, Oddbins). From a Bordeaux-owned estate, this is a sweet, tea-leafy Tokaji showing the influence of the benign botrytis mould. </p> <p><strong> 1998 The Virgilius Viognier, Yalumba</strong> (\u00a316.99, Oddbins Fine Wine; Noel Young, 01223 844 744; Bennetts, 01386 840 392). Yalumba has produced an Aussie white that compares with the best Condrieus from the northern Rhne. Subtle oak and flavours of white peach and apricot. </p> <p><strong> 1997 Ridge Geyserville</strong> (from \u00a318.95, Adnams, 01502 727 220; Friarwood, 020 7736 2628; Harvey Nichols; Lea &amp; Sandeman, 020 7244 0522; Morris &amp; Verdin, 020 7357 8866). Zinfandel specialist Paul Draper is one of California's most intelligent winemakers. This Zin-based field blend from very old vines is heady, almost raisiny stuff with notes of tobacco, spice and sweet vanilla oak.</p>",

Top Alsace wines are some of France's finest whites. This rich Pinot Gris from a Grand Cru site is soft and spicy with flavours of peach, melon and fennel. 1996 Quinta do Portal Grande Reserva (\u00a315.95, Great Northern Wine Company, 01765 606 767; Ellis of Richmond, 020 8943 4033; Great Western Wine Company, 01225 322 800); Charles Hennings, 01798 872 485). French consultant Michel Rolland had a hand in this exciting Douro red made principally from Touriga Nacional grapes. This is peppery and intense with sweet fruit flavours. 1992 Tokaji Aszu, 5 Puttonyos, Disznoko (\u00a315.99 per 50cl, Oddbins). From a Bordeaux-owned estate, this is a sweet, tea-leafy Tokaji showing the influence of the benign botrytis mould. 1998 The Virgilius Viognier, Yalumba (\u00a316.99, Oddbins Fine Wine; Noel Young, 01223 844 744; Bennetts, 01386 840 392). Yalumba has produced an Aussie white that compares with the best Condrieus from the northern Rhne. Subtle oak and flavours of white peach and apricot. 1997 Ridge Geyserville (from \u00a318.95, Adnams, 01502 727 220; Friarwood, 020 7736 2628; Harvey Nichols; Lea &amp; Sandeman, 020 7244 0522; Morris &amp; Verdin, 020 7357 8866). Zinfandel specialist Paul Draper is one of California's most intelligent winemakers. This Zin-based field blend from very old vines is heady, almost raisiny stuff with notes of tobacco, spice and sweet vanilla oak.",

      "body": "<p>This is the time of year when those things I normally treat as accessories to a meal become the meal itself. I am thinking of the untidy heap of green beans on the side of the plate that, with a little chopped shallot, mustardy dressing and some shredded butterhead lettuce, becomes a light lunch. The grilled tomatoes that are normally an adjunct to a steak that find themselves dumped on garlic toast and playing a starring role in a bruschetta and goat's cheese garden lunch. The side order of couscous that gets a more elaborate seasoning (say a couple of slices of grilled salmon, matchsticks of cucumber and masses of mint) and ends up as my entire supper. </p> <p>I cannot deny that I like the idea of these culinary underdogs getting their moment of glory, but then I am someone for whom a baked potato has always been dinner, rather than just a lump of starch nestling next to the meat. It is the same with potato salad - though its traditional job may be to sit aside some thick slices of cold ham or beef, I find it can, if well made, make a good principal dish. In fact, that is just what it has been in my house since the sun started shining. </p> <p>Note the epithet 'well made'. This means starting with some decent spuds rather than those that have been sleeping in the vegetable rack. This is the occasion for splashing out on waxy-fleshed salad potatoes, such as the tapered La Ratte or Charlotte and the most tiny, most earthy of Jerseys, or perhaps just some seriously floury 'main-crop'. Organically grown potatoes taste noticeably better, too. You can't say this about all organic vegetables or fruit, but you can certainly say it about most food grown underground, such as carrots and parsnips. </p> <p>Received wisdom says that waxy potatoes are the ones for salad - those with a yellow flesh and thin skins. I both agree and disagree. While a candle-fleshed potato keeps its shape after tossing in the dressing, there is nothing quite like a crumbly main-crop tattie in a rustic presentation, falling apart temptingly in the mayo. </p> <p>Whatever, the more recently dug the potato, the more chance it will have a deep flavour, though, of course, much depends on the variety. Potatoes lose their flavour more quickly than you would think, and I see every reason for buying them as regularly as we buy the salad. I know this goes against the grain of convenience shopping, but good eating has never been without its inconveniences ever since man first had to chase a mammoth for his supper. I buy my potatoes, as with any other vegetable, when I need them, and cook them the day I get them home. Anyone who has eaten the potatoes from their organic bag from a farmers' market on the day of delivery will know what I mean. </p> <p>A potato salad can be an elegant affair where cherubic, kidney-shaped new potatoes, carefully scrubbed and boiled with mint, come dressed with hand-beaten mayonnaise, or an altogether rougher deal with coarse slices of pungent onion, the floury spuds crumbling into oily, vivid yellow mayo. Both can be good. </p> <p>To peel or not to peel? I can only say that it is an entirely personal thing, and anyone who gets into a fume about a flake of skin on their Jerseys doesn't have enough to do. On the other hand, the skin adds nothing except a bit of fibre and has an annoying habit of sticking to your knife. I find the skin a good thing only if it is very thin and meticulously scrubbed. But tell me I am not alone in finding something quietly perfect about a dish of scrupulously de-skinned new potatoes without the remotest flake of skin, dressed with a classic vinaigrette and some spanking fresh parsley. </p> <p> <strong> Roast new potato salad with rosemary and mustard</strong> </p> <p> Serves 4 as a side dish. </p> <p>25 new potatoes </p> <p>1 head of garlic </p> <p>olive oil </p> <p>a couple of sprigs of rosemary </p> <p><strong> for the dressing</strong> </p> <p>2 tbsps red-wine vinegar </p> <p>2 tbsps smooth Dijon mustard </p> <p>5 tbsps olive oil </p> <p>Scrub the potatoes thoroughly, then put them in an ovenproof dish or roasting tin. Break the garlic into cloves, but don't peel them, then add them to the potatoes. Drizzle over a little olive oil, then scatter with flakes of sea salt and the leaves from the rosemary sprigs. Bake at 200 C/gas mark 6 for 45 to 60 minutes till they are puffed and golden, their insides fluffy. </p> <p>Pour the vinegar into a small lidded jar with the mustard, olive oil, some salt and pepper and shake it hard to give a thick dressing. You can use a little whisk if you prefer. When the potatoes come from the oven, press down hard on each one with the back of spoon so that they crack open slightly, then pour over the hot mustard dressing. As you eat, press the soft garlic from its skins. </p> <p> <strong> Warm duck salad with fried potatoes, peas and mint</strong> </p> <p> Serves 2 as a main dish, 4 as a snack. </p> <p>2 large duck legs </p> <p>1 big, juicy lemon or 2 less generous ones </p> <p>500g new potatoes </p> <p>a bunch of mint </p> <p>100g shelled peas </p> <p>a little olive oil </p> <p>Put the duck, skin-side up, in a small, shallow, ovenproof dish. I use one of those French enamelled cast-iron numbers. Squeeze over the juice from half of the lemon, liberally season with salt and black pepper and put into a hot oven (200 C/gas mark 6) to roast until the skin is crisp and the meat is brown all the way through (about 50 minutes to an hour). </p> <p>Scrub the potatoes so thoroughly you can barely see any skin (it will only get in the way when you fry them later), then drop them into boiling salted water, adding about half of the mint. Meanwhile, bring another pan of water to the boil, salt it lightly and add the peas. Boil till tender and sweet, then drain them. </p> <p>Once the duck has roasted for half an hour, tip the fat off into a shallow pan (the sort that can go on the hob) and return the duck to the oven for a further half hour. </p> <p>When the potatoes are tender to the point of a knife, drain them thoroughly and cut them into thick slices. They will crumble a bit, but no matter. Warm the drained duck fat over a moderate heat and add the sliced potatoes and any crumbs of potato. They will slowly crisp. Dislodge them from the pan every now and again with a palette knife. </p> <p>Remove the duck from the oven, lift it from the dish with tongs on to a chopping board, and cut the meat from the bones, discarding any obviously excessive lumps of fat. Cut up the flesh a little, but try to leave it in fat, juicy pieces. Tip it into a salad bowl. Drain the peas and add them, too. Pull the remaining mint leaves from the stalks and chop them, then add them to the duck and and peas. </p> <p>When the potatoes are golden and crusty, lift them out (tongs or a draining spoon are best for this) and add them to the duck and mint. Pour most of the fat from the pan into a heat-proof pot and let it cool - you can use it to fry potatoes or to start cooking onions for a casserole. Put the pan back on the heat and squeeze in the remaining lemon juice. Stand back from the heat as you do this (mine jumped out and burned me), then scrape at the pan to loosen any golden crusty bits of potato, then quickly swish it into the salad bowl. Turn the pepper and salt mills over it once or twice, and add a splash - no more - of olive oil, then pile on to plates. </p> <p> <strong> New potato, herring, rocket and cr\u00e8me frache salad</strong> </p> <p> A sweet-sharp salad with a creamy dressing. Avoid the temptation to over-mix the salad when you are dressing it - the beetroot is inclined to send everything a very unfetching shade of marshmallow pink. Serves 4 as a light main course. </p> <p>300g waxy 'salad' potatoes </p> <p>4 small, cooked beetroot </p> <p>6 fillets of pickled herring </p> <p>4 medium-sized gherkins </p> <p>1 small sweet onion, peeled, </p> <p>or 4 trimmed spring onions </p> <p>200g rocket leaves and fine stems </p> <p>a small bunch of dill </p> <p>1 tbsp red-wine vinegar </p> <p>1 tbsp olive oil </p> <p>1 tsp smooth Dijon mustard </p> <p>100g cr\u00e8me frache </p> <p>100g live yogurt </p> <p>Scrub the potatoes and bring them to the boil in deep salted water. Let them simmer for 15 minutes or so, until they are tender to the point of a knife. </p> <p>Peel the beetroot, then cut them into thick wedges and put them in a mixing bowl. Remove the little wooden sticks that inevitably come with soused herrings and cut each fillet into six chunks, then add to the beetroot, but do not mix. </p> <p>Thickly slice the gherkins, then add them to the beetroot and herring. Peel the onion and slice it very finely, or chop the spring onion, and add to the bowl. Rinse the rocket leaves and check them over, removing any thick stalks or wilted leaves. Keep them separate from the rest of the ingredients. Chop the dill and add it to the beetroot and herring. </p> <p>Drain the potatoes, and peel off their skins as soon as they are cool enough to hold. Don't let them get cold - you want to dress them while they are warm. Cut each potato in half if they are very small, into quarters if not, and add them to the mixing bowl. </p> <p>With a fork, mix the vinegar and olive oil in a small bowl or jar, and season with salt and black pepper and the mustard, then beat in the cr\u00e8me frache and the yogurt. Gently fold the dressing into the rest of the ingredients in the bowl, but stirring only lightly to avoid the beetroot sending everything pink. Divide the rocket between four plates, and pile the potato salad between them.</p>",

Roast new potato salad with rosemary and mustard Serves 4 as a side dish. 25 new potatoes 1 head of garlic olive oil a couple of sprigs of rosemary for the dressing 2 tbsps red-wine vinegar 2 tbsps smooth Dijon mustard 5 tbsps olive oil Scrub the potatoes thoroughly, then put them in an ovenproof dish or roasting tin. Break the garlic into cloves, but don't peel them, then add them to the potatoes. Drizzle over a little olive oil, then scatter with flakes of sea salt and the leaves from the rosemary sprigs.

Warm duck salad with fried potatoes, peas and mint Serves 2 as a main dish, 4 as a snack. 2 large duck legs 1 big, juicy lemon or 2 less generous ones 500g new potatoes a bunch of mint 100g shelled peas a little olive oil Put the duck, skin-side up, in a small, shallow, ovenproof dish.

New potato, herring, rocket and cr\u00e8me frache salad A sweet-sharp salad with a creamy dressing. Avoid the temptation to over-mix the salad when you are dressing it - the beetroot is inclined to send everything a very unfetching shade of marshmallow pink. Serves 4 as a light main course. 300g waxy 'salad' potatoes 4 small, cooked beetroot 6 fillets of pickled herring 4 medium-sized gherkins 1 small sweet onion, peeled, or 4 trimmed spring onions 200g rocket leaves and fine stems a small bunch of dill 1 tbsp red-wine vinegar 1 tbsp olive oil 1 tsp smooth Dijon mustard 100g cr\u00e8me frache 100g live yogurt Scrub the potatoes and bring them to the boil in deep salted water. Let them simmer for 15 minutes or so, until they are tender to the point of a knife. Peel the beetroot, then cut them into thick wedges and put them in a mixing bowl. Remove the little wooden sticks that inevitably come with soused herrings and cut each fillet into six chunks, then add to the beetroot, but do not mix. Thickly slice the gherkins, then add them to the beetroot and herring. Peel the onion and slice it very finely, or chop the spring onion, and add to the bowl. Rinse the rocket leaves and check them over, removing any thick stalks or wilted leaves. Keep them separate from the rest of the ingredients. Chop the dill and add it to the beetroot and herring.

During the Second World War, along with 6,500 other Roma Gypsies from what is now the Czech Republic, Maria was deported to a Nazi concentration camp, in her case Auschwitz. Like nine out of 10 Czech Roma, her mother, father and sister died in the gas chambers. Maria was one of only 600 to survive.</p> <p>Communism kept a tight social lid on anti-Roma racism after the war but now the evils that Maria experienced have caught up with the next generation. Her son, Milan, was beaten up by police during an anti-racist demonstration. Her grandson, also called Milan, was attacked by 'skinheads' with baseball bats. They shattered his knee, broke his hand and fractured his skull. Her nephew was assaulted.</p> <p>'My grandmother saw too many children die in the camps,' says Milan Jnr, now in north London with his family waiting to hear whether their application for asylum is accepted by Britain. 'Now she saw all of us being beaten up too. For my grandmother history was repeating itself.'</p> <p>Maria died in 1995. Two years later her family fled the Czech Republic to escape the rising tide of anti-Roma violence which they, and many others, assert is allowed to continue by state authorities - local police, town councils, mayors - who are as racist as the thugs. 'Under Communism it was safe, because you could go to the police,' says Milan. 'Now most of the skinheads are policeman. Gypsies don't have any rights.'</p> <p>The story of Maria and her family illustrates the depth of suffering of a people who have fought for generations for recognition of their plight. The violence they have experienced is horribly commonplace, yet that Maria had children at all is unusual. 'Of the few Czech Roma who survived the Holocaust a large proportion had either been surgically sterilised while in the camps or rendered infertile by their treatment,' says Dr Donald Kennrick, one of the few academics to have carried out research on the Nazi genocide of gypsies.</p> <p>Since the death of the Eastern bloc in the Nineties there have been countless incidents of Roma being murdered or assaulted, of their homes being firebombed and their businesses being destroyed. If the victims were the families of Jewish survivors of the Holocaust it is unimaginable their persecution would not be met by international condemnation. But, because they are Roma and have been less than successful in publicising their own cause, it has slipped by widely unremarked.</p> <p>The problems faced by the Roma of central and eastern Europe do not appear to trouble Britain. Since the autumn of 1997, when there was a sudden increase in the number of Roma from the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Romania claiming asylum in Britain, the Home Office has maintained a policy of refusing almost 100 per cent of claims at point of application.</p> <p>By contrast, Canada has accepted more than 85 per cent of similar claims. 'It's clear from examination of the claims that the overwhelming majority are purely economic migrants,' the Home Office said last week; it's a position that has done little to discourage racist press comment with which some tabloids and local newspapers have greeted the Roma's arrival in the UK.</p> <p>The Home Office may not be able to sustain opposition to Roma asylum-seekers for long. On Thursday the House of Lords will give its judgment in the case of Milan Horvath, a Slovak Roma who entered the UK with his wife and child in October 1997.</p> <p>He claimed asylum on the grounds that he had a well-founded fear of persecution. In 1985 his father was murdered by racist thugs, a killing police failed to investigate. His brother was beaten up by a group using chains and baseball bats, and other Roma neighbours were killed. His home was set on fire and ransacked so many times that he and his family took refuge in a makeshift dugout in the back garden. The police, says Horvath, did nothing.</p> <p>Home Secretary Jack Straw has argued that the authorities in countries like the Czech Republic and Slovakia have the powers to investigate racist attack and that therefore Roma cannot claim a well-founded fear of persecution as understood by the 1951 International Convention on Refugees, because the racism is not state-sponsored.</p> <p>Horvath's legal team is arguing that, whatever the theoretical position, in practice the authorities in Slovakia are so racist that they will not act, leaving their client in fear of his life. The House of Lords is being asked to decide what level of police inaction amounts to the state condoning racist violence. Should it find in Horvath's favour, the ruling will apply to other countries.</p> <p>In the early stages of Horvath's case the Home Secretary refused to accept his account of his family's suffering. Straw said it was unbelievable his family had been attacked so often. Since then, as the case graduated from the asylum tribunals to the court system, his account has been taken as fact. Even so, says Peter Jorrow of the Refugee Legal Council, which has represented Horvath, the Home Office has little time for the details.</p> <p>'They've been ignoring the evidence,' Jorrow says. 'We put in lots of evidence on the plight of the Roma, from the US State Department and the UNHCR [the United Nations' refugee agency]. All they put in was a letter from the Slovak ambassador. The Home Office refuses to engage with the issue on an evidential basis. All they say is, in our view it doesn't amount to persecution.'</p> <p>Milan Daniel will be interested in the outcome of Horvath's case. 'The British government say the Czech Republic is a safe country and this is why we must go back,' he says. 'They are very, very wrong. I have to thank the British government for all they have given us, but they mustn't send us back. We have nothing to go back to.'</p> <p>The Bock family, now living in a council flat in Clacton-on-Sea, Essex, will be watching the Horvath case closely. Villem Bock' s father, Frantisek, spent years as a child in Auschwitz. He was one of only three children of 11 to survive. 'All the time my father would talk about the camp,' Villem, 48, says. 'He told me how he saw his parents being taken to the gas chambers. That was the last he saw of them.'</p> <p>Sixty years later, Villem also found himself detained in a camp, this time British. When he, his wife Valeria and their 10-year-old daughter Marie arrived at Stansted Airport on 1 March, Villem was interviewed for three days before being detained at Tinsley House, near Gatwick.</p> <p>Back in the Czech Republic, Valeria's brother, Daniel, had been murdered by racists. Valeria and Villem had, in turn, been forced out of their jobs and then from their homes. 'They were beating people up in the streets,' Valeria says. 'They burned down Roma houses. They did everything they could to make life harder. We moved to a new town and the people told us we had to leave.' So they did. 'I couldn't help but be worried for my children.'</p> <p>Their journey took them to Canada, which they left when Villem's mother, still in the Czech Republic, was diagnosed with cancer. They left two teenage daughters behind, who now have refugee status in Canada. As soon as they arrived back in the Czech Republic they realised conditions were no better. They got out, first to Norway and then to the Netherlands, each country refusing their application. Villem was released from Tinsley House, on payment of a surety by a supporter of the Roma cause. All the family care about now is that they are not returned to the Czech Republic. 'The Roma are still being attacked,' Villem says. 'It feels as if it will soon be the same as when Hitler was in power. The skinhead movement is too strong.</p> <p>'Everybody has forgotten about the Roma. The concentration camps were for the Jews and the Gypsies but nobody remembers the Gypsies.' There are no museums to the Gypsy dead of the Holocaust, he says. At Lety, in the Czech Republic, a concentration camp for Gypsies was established during the Second World War. There are no memorials there of the sort established at Auschwitz or Dachau. The land is now a pig farm. 'They did it because they think of us as pigs.'</p> <p>For the Bock family and the Daniel family the Holocaust is not part of a history that must be remembered for the sake of remembrance. It is part of their present, the brutality of their family's past echoing down the years.</p> <p>The judges in the Lords might like to listen to those echoes as they reach their judgment this week.</p>",

This is where slugs come on sabbatical as a reward for exceptional service. It is a slug health farm. And everyone knows that slugs and snails regard a delphinium as a delicacy beyond all others. In previous years, our attempts at delphinium growing have foundered on the smacking of slug lips. Yet this year we have perfect delphiniums - uneaten towers of shimmering azure blue, violet and purple. Monkland church spire can only echo them hazily across the fields beyond the river. </p> <p>In the chalky soil of North Hampshire where I grew up, delphiniums marked hot summer days like pillars of flowering righteousness - as reliably present in the summer herbaceous border as church was on Sundays. I would return from school in early July to find them there unheralded and confident on a summer's day. </p> <p>The memory of this makes me very sad. The thing I resent and regret most about being sent away to boarding school at seven was that the seasons of my subsequent childhood were lost. You'd say goodbye to home in mid-spring and return in high summer with all the shifting movement and subtlety of growing things discarded. May and June were glimpsed as though from a train, beyond all reach save memory. I cannot remember any flowers at school. Just-mown grass, the smell of linseed oil and the horrible rhododendrons. You can take the child away from home but you cannot take the home from inside the child. You learn to hold it inside and, long past the usefulness of that particular trick, it hangs on there: gardens, fields and whole parishes tucked away as a survival kit. </p> <p>Years later, in the mid-80s, Sarah and I are driving down to Kent at about this time of year. We go round a corner and the barley, still green, suddenly billows and ripples like silk on the downland. And I feel the same acute pang of homesickness as I did as a child, allowed out for a day, seeing the beech tree fill with leaf and the hedges smoky with cow parsley. Spring drifting into summer without me. It was then that I knew London was a place of exile, and probably the moment I mentally pulled out of our business and started screwing up that patch of our lives. </p> <p>So now we have delphiniums of our own, in our own grown-up lives, growing here in Herefordshire, a hundred miles from Hampshire and so many miles of water under the bridge. We haven't done anything particularly out of the ordinary this year that has made the flowers grow so tall and unpalatable to the slugs and snails. I am talking of Delphinium elatum hybrids, which are the most common and easiest to grow. We have two types, 'Black Knight', which is a dark indigo with a black eye and 'King Arthur' - inky blue with a white eye. </p> <p>White is officially banned from the Jewel garden, but keeps sneaking in under some guise or other, and it passes the colour police in this instance because the combined effect is not white and blue but a violet made softer and paler. We bought them as young plants and planted them in last April. They did nothing to write home about last summer and we did not protect them in any way over winter, although conventional wisdom advises putting a mulch of grit over the crowns in winter to protect them from slugs. </p> <p>We have D 'Faust' on order - I saw it at Chelsea and loved its intensity of dark purple - although I see that it is described in the RHS Encyclopedia of Garden Plants as being 'deep cornflower-blue... overlaid with purple, and with indigo eyes'. Whatever. The effect combines to a shimmering Rothko-like intensity of purple. The hybrids come in colours ranging from deep purple to white, via blue, mauve and pink. But I want my delphiniums to be essentially blue. This partly to reclaim lost emotional territory, but also because blues don't come cheap in the garden and should be encouraged and nurtured at every opportunity. Delphiniums don't just turn out willingly in indigo, navy, cobalt, aquamarine and icy sapphire, but they do so with the volume turned up. They make a big blue sound and, despite my own maudlin memories and the connotation of the blues, it is a joyous noise. A blue party. </p> <p>Of the D elatum hybrids, the 'King Arthur' group, 'Nimrod', 'Nobility' and the 'Black Knight' group all give you rich, dark blues. 'Fenella', 'Blue Tit' and 'Blue Nile' are lighter, clearer tones. D grandiflorum has a solitary flower of a staggeringly intense blue. I say that, I admit, only on the evidence of a photograph in Nori and Sandra Pope's book Colour by Design (\u00a325, Conran Octopus) as I have never grown it myself. They class it as a perennial, though it is normally treated as an annual. It is much smaller than a 'normal' delphinium, but they flower for longer, keeping going all summer if they are kept cut. </p> <p>You can get small delphinium hybrids with stumpy stems, but what is the point? Delphiniums take up their space in the air and even the smallest garden can be made to seem bigger by good strong vertical growth. Of course, a flower spike 6ft tall or more needs staking. </p> <p>If you find that slugs make it hardly worth the bother of persevering with delphiniums, then their cousin the monkshood - or aconitum - is the nearest thing to creating that massed, blue/violet effect. Slugs steer well clear of aconitums and their poison. But inedibility aside, they are a good, if less intense, substitute for delphiniums. We have Aconitum napellus 'Sparks Variety', which is a deep violet, flowering now and will last for most of the summer. A 'Newry Blue' is on order, and has lighter, bluer flowers. Christopher Lloyd, in Lloyd's Garden Flowers (\u00a330, Cassell) says magisterially of A napellus: 'It need not detain us.' I was so struck by the dismissiveness of this that I have just nipped outside to check on its detainability. Right about a lot of things, he's wrong about this one. It fails any specimen-plant test, but is invaluable in a border, guaranteeing an uneaten intensity of blue and violet that is otherwise so rare. But, I concede, it ain't no delphinium. </p> <p> A carmichaelii sounds good, as do A carmichaelii 'Barker's Variety' and the darker blue 'Kelmscott'. Whatever the variety of carmichaelii, they flower late in summer, coinciding, if you are lucky, with the second flush of delphiniums. Unless, of course, you have been dispatched to boarding school, in which case you will miss everything. Very much.</p> <p>\u0095 Thompson &amp; Morgan special offer Observer readers can buy six Delphinium 'Arrow', mixed, for \u00a314.99 including UK p&amp;p - supplied as bare-root plants with at least three breaks.

      "body": "<p>Tony Blair's dinner with German Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der near Berlin's Glienecke Bridge last Thursday lasted longer than expected. The two leaders discussed the future of Europe over stuffed turbot and rack of lamb, washed down with a 1997 Baden Riesling and a mellow Sp\u00e4tburgunder from the same year.</p> <p>The discussion, after quips from Blair about how England and Germany should forge an alliance in 2004 to make sure that France don't win the next European Championship, quickly turned to the speech last Tuesday by the French President, Jacques Chirac.</p> <p>When Chirac got up to speak in the Reichstag he knew that what he was about to say would toss the finely balanced European debate into stormy waters. France and Germany were still the leading players, he made clear, and if other nations (namely Britain) didn't want to forge ahead with plans for closer integration, then they would be left in the slow lane.</p> <p>Chirac had opened the way to a two-speed Europe - with Paris and Berlin in a sleek Mercedes on the highway to integration while Britain phut-phuts along in an easily overtaken old Morris Minor. This is supposed to be the unspoken British worry. And Chirac had just spoken about it.</p> <p>Foreign Secretary Robin Cook was briefed on Chirac's idea to form a 'pioneer group' of countries which would form a continental power base. His response was rapid: 'It is important that we have a Europe of equal member states, in which all states have the same rights and all states participate fully in the projects of the EU.'</p> <p>Talk of a two-speed Europe sends a shiver down the spine of the Government. They don't mind talking about 'flexibility' with some states having different arrangements on defence or border controls. But two-speed? That is not part of Blair's vision.</p> <p>So, what is going on? Was Chirac rubbing Blair's nose in it? Were he and Schr\u00f6der signalling that Britain had better get on board with the euro or suffer the consequences? Would Blair find himself locked out of the key European decision-making bodies? No, it is all far more complicated than that.</p> <p>To understand Chirac's speech you need to understand the byzantine ways of French politics. Observers point out that the centre-right Gaullist President has previously been relatively cautious on Europe. Last week's conversion, the cynics say, was a cleverly judged manoeuvre to boost the President's popularity in France and his profile at home and abroad.</p> <p>In 2002 France goes to the polls to choose the next President and elect a new government. Currently Lionel Jospin, an old-style Socialist, is Prime Minister and governs with the help of the Communists and the Greens. But he has presidential ambitions. Previously Jospin and Chirac have set aside their differences in the interests of smooth government. Now, 18 months before the elections, it seems that battle has commenced.</p> <p>Key to the campaign, and to last week's speech, are the group of Chirac advisers dubbed la douzaine europhile. They include bureaucrats, businessmen and politicians. All are ferociously capable. All have been close to Chirac for years. They are also very keen to be still walking past the Elys\u00e9e Palace's liveried footmen and through its corridors lined with Gobelin tapestries in several years time.</p> <p>They include a former Prime Minister, Alain Jupp\u00e9, at least two former Ministers and, most interesting of all, J\u00e9rme Monod, a heavy-set 69-year-old bureaucrat turned businessman, a Commander of the L\u00e9gion d'Honneur and a key Chirac aide for nearly 30 years.</p> <p>Monod's role is vital. Over the past few months the staterooms of the Elys\u00e9e Palace have seen a fierce debate between aides who wanted Chirac to make an impact with his Reichstag speech, those who wanted to wait and those who opposed any kind of major statement on Europe. Monod - who has always favoured a strong French role at the heart of an increasingly unified Europe - is thought to have been essential in convincing the President that the time was right for a major pronouncement.</p> <p>Though the decision on the speech was taken several weeks ago, spectacular confirmation of the political acumen of the President and his closest advisers came last week. Last Monday the newspaper Lib\u00e9ration published a poll which showed that 59 per cent of the French now describe themselves as 'enthusiastic' or 'favourable' to the European project. An amazing 70 per cent felt political and economic unification should be accelerated.</p> <p>Chirac's words caught the public mood perfectly. He spoke in relatively vague, visionary terms, but maintained a stress on the importance of the nation state. He also outmanoeuvred Jospin, who was reduced to making churlish comments about how the President's position did not reflect current government policy. His remarks were barely reported.</p> <p>Somehow Chirac has sensed a seismic shift in public opinion. The significance of the change the Lib\u00e9ration poll reveals is difficult to underestimate. Just three years ago polls showed the nation split equally been sceptics and euro-enthusiasts.</p> <p>In many ways the Germans stole the initiative when Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer made his controversial speech in May, saying that a federal Europe should be the EU's endgame.</p> <p>Chirac nicely stole it back. 'We know it is going to happen and we need to be a major player,' said one French journalist last week. 'We also need to keep up with the Germans if we are going to keep them in check. As for the British, it is a bit like your style of football. You are looking a little dated and a little marginalised to the average Frenchman these days. If we bother looking at all.'</p> <p>In France the consensus is now clear. The prospect of greater integration provokes little controversy. In fact it is seen, if anything, as a bulwark against the spread of 'McDonald's culture' and the 'Americanisation of the world'.</p> <p>Yesterday the French assumed the rotating presidency of the European Union and the government's avowed intention of overseeing a steady overhaul of the EU to ready it for further expansion has the genuine support of the electorate.

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair's dinner with German Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der near Berlin's Glienecke Bridge last Thursday lasted longer than expected. The two leaders discussed the future of Europe over stuffed turbot and rack of lamb, washed down with a 1997 Baden Riesling and a mellow Sp\u00e4tburgunder from the same year. The discussion, after quips from Blair about how England and Germany should forge an alliance in 2004 to make sure that France don't win the next European Championship, quickly turned to the speech last Tuesday by the French President, Jacques Chirac. When Chirac got up to speak in the Reichstag he knew that what he was about to say would toss the finely balanced European debate into stormy waters. France and Germany were still the leading players, he made clear, and if other nations (namely Britain) didn't want to forge ahead with plans for closer integration, then they would be left in the slow lane. Chirac had opened the way to a two-speed Europe - with Paris and Berlin in a sleek Mercedes on the highway to integration while Britain phut-phuts along in an easily overtaken old Morris Minor. This is supposed to be the unspoken British worry. And Chirac had just spoken about it. Foreign Secretary Robin Cook was briefed on Chirac's idea to form a 'pioneer group' of countries which would form a continental power base. His response was rapid: 'It is important that we have a Europe of equal member states, in which all states have the same rights and all states participate fully in the projects of the EU.' Talk of a two-speed Europe sends a shiver down the spine of the Government. They don't mind talking about 'flexibility' with some states having different arrangements on defence or border controls. But two-speed? That is not part of Blair's vision. So, what is going on? Was Chirac rubbing Blair's nose in it? Were he and Schr\u00f6der signalling that Britain had better get on board with the euro or suffer the consequences? Would Blair find himself locked out of the key European decision-making bodies? No, it is all far more complicated than that. To understand Chirac's speech you need to understand the byzantine ways of French politics. Observers point out that the centre-right Gaullist President has previously been relatively cautious on Europe. Last week's conversion, the cynics say, was a cleverly judged manoeuvre to boost the President's popularity in France and his profile at home and abroad. In 2002 France goes to the polls to choose the next President and elect a new government. Currently Lionel Jospin, an old-style Socialist, is Prime Minister and governs with the help of the Communists and the Greens. But he has presidential ambitions. Previously Jospin and Chirac have set aside their differences in the interests of smooth government. Now, 18 months before the elections, it seems that battle has commenced. Key to the campaign, and to last week's speech, are the group of Chirac advisers dubbed la douzaine europhile. They include bureaucrats, businessmen and politicians. All are ferociously capable. All have been close to Chirac for years. They are also very keen to be still walking past the Elys\u00e9e Palace's liveried footmen and through its corridors lined with Gobelin tapestries in several years time. They include a former Prime Minister, Alain Jupp\u00e9, at least two former Ministers and, most interesting of all, J\u00e9rme Monod, a heavy-set 69-year-old bureaucrat turned businessman, a Commander of the L\u00e9gion d'Honneur and a key Chirac aide for nearly 30 years. Monod's role is vital. Over the past few months the staterooms of the Elys\u00e9e Palace have seen a fierce debate between aides who wanted Chirac to make an impact with his Reichstag speech, those who wanted to wait and those who opposed any kind of major statement on Europe. Monod - who has always favoured a strong French role at the heart of an increasingly unified Europe - is thought to have been essential in convincing the President that the time was right for a major pronouncement. Though the decision on the speech was taken several weeks ago, spectacular confirmation of the political acumen of the President and his closest advisers came last week. Last Monday the newspaper Lib\u00e9ration published a poll which showed that 59 per cent of the French now describe themselves as 'enthusiastic' or 'favourable' to the European project. An amazing 70 per cent felt political and economic unification should be accelerated. Chirac's words caught the public mood perfectly. He spoke in relatively vague, visionary terms, but maintained a stress on the importance of the nation state. He also outmanoeuvred Jospin, who was reduced to making churlish comments about how the President's position did not reflect current government policy. His remarks were barely reported. Somehow Chirac has sensed a seismic shift in public opinion. The significance of the change the Lib\u00e9ration poll reveals is difficult to underestimate. Just three years ago polls showed the nation split equally been sceptics and euro-enthusiasts. In many ways the Germans stole the initiative when Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer made his controversial speech in May, saying that a federal Europe should be the EU's endgame. Chirac nicely stole it back. 'We know it is going to happen and we need to be a major player,' said one French journalist last week. 'We also need to keep up with the Germans if we are going to keep them in check. As for the British, it is a bit like your style of football. You are looking a little dated and a little marginalised to the average Frenchman these days. If we bother looking at all.' In France the consensus is now clear. The prospect of greater integration provokes little controversy. In fact it is seen, if anything, as a bulwark against the spread of 'McDonald's culture' and the 'Americanisation of the world'. Yesterday the French assumed the rotating presidency of the European Union and the government's avowed intention of overseeing a steady overhaul of the EU to ready it for further expansion has the genuine support of the electorate. The French national mint has already stopped printing francs in readiness for the full introduction of the euro in 2002. There has been no word of protest. A few lone voices - some from Chirac's own Gaullist party - carped at the President's Reichstag speech. Right-wing politicians spoke of 'accelerating a fatal process for France and the other nations of Europe'.

The night air was warm and sticky, and on opening the car door the first thing we heard was loud, bellowing laughter, as if from an over-excited boy.</p> <p>In the garden sat a group of friends and family drinking wine, beer and mineral water, and eating birthday cake. The faces were smiling and animated, and all were indistinct, except one. The thick dark hair, olive skin, intense eyes and joyous smile. Then there was that boyish laugh again. I knew him instantly.</p> <p>Sitting there, dressed only in a pair of black Versace swimming trunks and clutching a fat Cuban cigar, was Diego Maradona. As we made our way towards the group he looked up.</p> <p>'Andres!' he exclaimed on greeting my friend.</p> <p>Then, with equal vigour, he welcomed me with an illuminated face and outstretched hand. Quickly I took it, unable to avoid the irony of the situation: I was shaking the Hand of God.</p> <p>Only an hour earlier such an extraordinary meeting had seemed highly unlikely. My holiday in Cuba was coming to an end. I had been staying with my friend Andy Cawthorne in Havana - 10 years ago we trained together: now while I work for BBC Radio Leeds, Andy is Reuters' man in Havana - and soon after I arrived Andy told me that he had met Maradona several times since the Argentine arrived on the Caribbean island in January at the invitation of the Cuban leader Fidel Castro.</p> <p>Andy added there was a chance that I, too, might meet Maradona, but then came the news that he had left the island on the very day of my arrival, and would be away for several days in Germany, playing in a testimonial match for Lothar Matth\u00e4us.</p> <p>I shrugged off my disappointment and had almost forgotten about it until one night, two days before I was to return to England, the phone rang at Andy's apartment. We'd just finished dinner and I was slumbering in a hammock when Andy shouted, 'He's back!'</p> <p>The call was from Alfredo, an Argentine cameraman who worked with Andy and who had become one of Maradona's best friends in Cuba. Alfredo had travelled with Maradona to Germany, but had returned home ahead of him. Now, Maradona was back in Cuba and had gone straight from the plane to Alfredo's house where they were having a party to celebrate the 12th birthday of Alfredo's son Santiago.</p> <p>As we drove along Havana's bumpy, broken streets I have to confess that that for a moment I wanted to turn back. We carried on, and the moment we shook hands I knew we had made the right decision. Despite the 10-hour flight Maradona's energy and charisma in the flesh were remarkable. Of course the figure I was now looking at was very different to the footballer I remember. His bare torso was bloated and he looked at least a couple of stone overweight. At 39 the man is still unmistakable, but the mistakes of the man have left their mark.</p> <p>The garden was perfect for such a gathering. A large patio area was filled with a few tables and chairs, and a big brick-built barbecue glowed and gave out delicious smells.The dozen or so of us included Andy's wife Euridice, Alfredo and his wife Vicki, and the couple's young sons Santiago and Frederico. There was also Maradona's great friend and manager, the white-haired Guillermo Coppola, and a few other family and friends.</p> <p>To begin with there were three or four people sitting between me and Maradona - or Diegito, as he is known to his closest friends - and I simply listened. Suddenly as we were finishing off the birthday cake, Maradona burst into song. His voice was surprisingly good. The songs were slow Argentine tangos with sad melodies, normally telling the stories of lost loves, reflecting a melancholic side to his nature. After singing three or four on his own, he enlisted one of his friends for a duet. Then, as it headed towards midnight and a few of the guests started to drift away, I seized my chance. I got up and took a seat at the round garden table, directly opposite him.</p> <p>For a moment I didn't know what to say. In the end I opted for a subject I know both of us know a lot about: his brilliant goal against England in the 1986 World Cup. 'Is it,' I ask, a little hesitantly, 'the best you ever scored?'</p> <p>He listened patiently, almost like a teacher to a pupil.</p> <p>'Si!' he roared excitedly, and then gripped the gathering with a precise, near-photographic recital of how he took a ball from his Argentine colleagues, then danced gracefully through the English team. Amazingly he could still name the players he left in his wake.</p> <p>'Butcher. Fenwick. Reid.'</p> <p>I helped him with the pronunciations. Then, in perhaps the most surreal moment of the whole evening (and there were a few), he asked me where Mark Hateley was nowadays.</p> <p>'I don't know,' I was forced to confess. 'The last I knew he was player-manager of Hull City, but I'm not sure now.'</p> <p>Then, like two guys sitting in a pub, we started talking football. He began by going back to the 1982 World Cup, and how the German goalkeeper Harald Schumacher notoriously tackled an attacking player, leaving him injured on the ground.</p> <p>'Battiston?' I said. 'It was Battiston who was hurt!'</p> <p>'Muy bien! Muy bien! Muy bien!' he repeated, clearly impressed that I remembered it so well. I rose to imitate the dreadful tackle by Schumacher, and Maradona nodded encouragingly.</p> <p>We talked of my home-town team, Derby County. Earlier some of the other guests had mocked when I asked if they had heard of the Rams. But Maradona simply nodded.</p> <p>Had he heard of our Argentine striker, Esteban Fuertes, who'd been forced to return to Argentina because of irregularities with his passport?</p> <p>'Yes, and he was a good player,' said Maradona.</p> <p>'We could do with you playing for Derby,' I joked.</p> <p>'I'll come and be manager!' he fired back, with a big smile.</p> <p>'And I can be your assistant!' I shouted, and together we rose from our chairs and did a high five on the deal.</p> <p>I asked him who would win Euro 2000. 'Holland have a great chance,' he replied, 'first because it's local for them.'</p> <p>Then we debated who should host the 2006 World Cup. 'It's time for the Africans to have a World Cup, and who better than South Africa?' he said.</p> <p>Who was his own footballing hero?</p> <p>'George Best. He's my idol.'</p> <p>As for the redevelopment of Wembley, his view was emphatic. 'Wembley is the stadium,' he said. 'I wish they could have just remodelled it, instead of destroying it.'</p> <p>In the way that family snaps are passed around at parties, envelopes of photos were being circulated in our small gathering, but these were of Maradona in Germany several days earlier. 'It was fantastic, very emotional. I felt marvellous because I could run. I felt as if time had not passed. I felt fantastic with the ball at my feet. The crowd had not forgotten anything about what I used to do on the pitch.'</p> <p>And he was in no doubt where the credit lay for the turnaround in his fortunes. 'When I reached Cuba my heart was at 30 per cent, not even that,' he said. 'I went to play [in Germany] with 60 per cent, almost like a normal person. For that I want to thank the Cuban doctors, Fidel, all of Cuba, for their support and respect. Of course I dedicate that game to all the Cubans. Here I have found peace, tranquility.'</p> <p>(Certainly as I looked at him his time in Cuba appears to have been well spent. Yes he was still overweight, but he seemed much better than the swollen, sorry figure who arrived in the country at the start of the year. He is expected to stay on the island for several more months, his presence and slow recovery there seen as a publicity coup for Cuba's health service. And he's playing football again: not just the Matth\u00e4us testimonial - which won rave reviews - but regularly in Havana, on a concrete pitch behind the health spa where he lives.)</p> <p>At one point, as if to emphasise his gratitude to his new - albeit temporary - home, he leapt up and dived into the swimming pool, splashing around chanting support for Fidel Castro, and Cuba. When he removed the towel from his shoulders, I could clearly see the tattoo of Che Guevara on his right shoulder. (On Maradona's other shoulder is another ornate tattoo, of what looked like an eagle.

      "bodyText": "We arrived at the white-painted detached house to find it hidden from the road by a swathe of palm trees. The night air was warm and sticky, and on opening the car door the first thing we heard was loud, bellowing laughter, as if from an over-excited boy. In the garden sat a group of friends and family drinking wine, beer and mineral water, and eating birthday cake. The faces were smiling and animated, and all were indistinct, except one. The thick dark hair, olive skin, intense eyes and joyous smile. Then there was that boyish laugh again. I knew him instantly. Sitting there, dressed only in a pair of black Versace swimming trunks and clutching a fat Cuban cigar, was Diego Maradona. As we made our way towards the group he looked up. 'Andres!' he exclaimed on greeting my friend. Then, with equal vigour, he welcomed me with an illuminated face and outstretched hand. Quickly I took it, unable to avoid the irony of the situation: I was shaking the Hand of God. Only an hour earlier such an extraordinary meeting had seemed highly unlikely. My holiday in Cuba was coming to an end. I had been staying with my friend Andy Cawthorne in Havana - 10 years ago we trained together: now while I work for BBC Radio Leeds, Andy is Reuters' man in Havana - and soon after I arrived Andy told me that he had met Maradona several times since the Argentine arrived on the Caribbean island in January at the invitation of the Cuban leader Fidel Castro. Andy added there was a chance that I, too, might meet Maradona, but then came the news that he had left the island on the very day of my arrival, and would be away for several days in Germany, playing in a testimonial match for Lothar Matth\u00e4us. I shrugged off my disappointment and had almost forgotten about it until one night, two days before I was to return to England, the phone rang at Andy's apartment. We'd just finished dinner and I was slumbering in a hammock when Andy shouted, 'He's back!' The call was from Alfredo, an Argentine cameraman who worked with Andy and who had become one of Maradona's best friends in Cuba. Alfredo had travelled with Maradona to Germany, but had returned home ahead of him. Now, Maradona was back in Cuba and had gone straight from the plane to Alfredo's house where they were having a party to celebrate the 12th birthday of Alfredo's son Santiago. As we drove along Havana's bumpy, broken streets I have to confess that that for a moment I wanted to turn back. We carried on, and the moment we shook hands I knew we had made the right decision.
