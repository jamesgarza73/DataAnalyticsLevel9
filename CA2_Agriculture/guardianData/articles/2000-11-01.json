Eriksson is due to succeed Kevin Keegan full-time after seeing out his contract at Lazio, with the FA \"hopeful\" of reaching an agreement with the Italian champions for the Swede to take charge in three World Cup qualifiers in March in June. But one Lazio official said it was \"probably wishful thinking\" to expect Eriksson to stay until June 30, and there is strong speculation that the club's president Sergio Cragnotti will now not hesitate to dismiss the 52-year-old at the slightest slip in the Champions League or Serie A. Cragnotti and Eriksson had a stormy 35-minute meeting yesterday, and the president is thought to feel angry and betrayed by Eriksson's behaviour, despite his public pronouncements that he under-stood his coach's decision and realised he needed \"a new challenge and other stimulation\". Cragnotti has extracted a pledge from Eriksson to see out his contract but knows he has ready-made replacements in Dino Zoff, a former Lazio coach who returned to the club as vice-president after leading Italy to the Euro 2000 final, and Roberto Mancini, an up-and-coming member of Lazio's coaching staff. Eriksson has told the FA he would like to take charge for the qualifiers on a part-time basis but Lazio seem less than happy at that prospect and may try to block the arrangement when discussions resume. \"The FA did not ask if Sven-Goran Eriksson could do the England job part-time,\" Cragnotti claimed.

      "bodyText": "The former England captain Alec Stewart will today be named in an Indian police report into alleged match-rigging. The 162-page report, which was handed over to India's sports minister Sukhdev Singh Dhindsa this week, contains details of matches that were allegedly fixed and names five Indian and at least seven non-Indian players, including the former West Indies captain Brian Lara. Dhindsa, when asked on Star News television to identify players named in the report, said: \"Lara is also there, and Stewart, the English player. There are two or three [non-Indian] others, including Pakistani players.\" The report, which was compiled by India's Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), is based on testimony gathered from a number of bookmakers who gave details of match-rigging and their involvement with players. It is not clear what Stewart is actually accused of committing any offence or whether he is merely mentioned by bookmakers. According to one source, non-Indian players named in the report are accused of \"indirect\" involvement in match-rigging and \"being offered money by Indian bookmakers and punters\". Stewart, who is touring with England in Pakistan, refused to comment but the fact that his name appears in the report will put Lord MacLaurin, chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board, in a difficult position. MacLaurin has stated that \"if someone is under suspicion he should be removed from the game until his case is heard and his innocence is proved\". A spokesman for the ECB said yesterday: \"We will not be saying anything until we see the report.\" The publication of the report comes as the former Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Paul Condon, who is in charge of the International Cricket Council's investigation into corruption, prepares to speak publicly today for the first time on the subject. The report names the Indian Test players Mohammed Azharuddin, Ajay Jadeja, Nayan Mongia, Manoj Prabhakar and Ajay Sharma. The Indian team physiotherapist Ali Irani is accused of passing on information on matches and the squad to bookmakers. But the report finds that there is insufficient evidence against the former Indian captain and coach Kapil Dev. Other non-Indian players named in the report are said to include the Australian batsman Mark Waugh, the former Pakistan captain Salim Malik and the former Australian Test batsman Dean Jones. A copy of the report is to be sent to the South African inquiry into match-rigging and will also be made available to the ICC and cricket governing bodies around the world. The CBI has admitted that it does not have enough evidence to prosecute any players and that its report is based entirely on interviews with bookmakers. But officials are examining the possibility of bringing charges against Azharuddin and Sharma under special legislation aimed at curbing corruption among civil servants.

      "body": "<p>The cheque is pinned on Karen Kaur's office notice board - proof, she says, that the scheme on which she is a support worker can have transforming effects. \"Look, here's the first pay cheque of one of my boys. He photocopied it for me. Isn't it great?\" All the scheme's participants are under 25; most have struggled with school, vanished from other training courses, are without a secure home and have, in some cases, drifted into crime. </p> <p>Her small, freshly-painted office in Hackney, east London, and the cheque fluttering on the cork board are evidence, says Kaur, that the work of the Youth Build Trust (YBT) can help where other training courses have failed. \"This isn't just training; it's a guaranteed job and, perhaps more importantly, a home - somewhere secure to live at the end.\" </p> <p>It is the housing element of the YBT scheme, currently running at 11 sites in Britain, that makes it unique. Young people who are unemployed and in housing need are given the chance to train in construction, get National Vocational Qualification I and II, a job at the end of the course and the chance to live in the house they build, or to apply for alternative accommodation through the housing association where they are working. </p> <p>\"Here they're doing the work for real,\" says temporary training manager Dave Telfer. It's not like college where you have a go for five minutes on a test bench,\" Building accommodation for a YBT colleague or for the YBT itself - Kaur's office is being refurbished by her team - is an important part of the motivation for most participants. </p> <p>There is also more support than you would expect on the average training course. Elaine McGlone is the support worker for the first YBT project in Scotland, which was started earlier this year in Paisley. \"I used to be a nurse and then worked for Dr Barnardo's, but this really stretches me - I'm their advocate,\" she says. McGlone deals with court visits, probation officers and can help trainees find accommodation. \"And I can just help and encourage when they get out of bed the wrong way and feel rubbish.\" </p> <p>Most of the participants are no angels, she says. Many have been in trouble with the police and dodged school for years, but only by giving them intense support can she be sure that those who are capable will complete the course. </p> <p>Twenty-year-old Joe Allan began skipping school at the age of 12. He says: \"I've been on four training courses and always dropped out. I knew they were just six months out of the dole. But this was worthwhile from day one. I haven't missed a day's work. This is real work, not training.\" </p> <p>For others, a criminal record has seemed an insuperable barrier to finding work. The guaranteed job at the end of the YBT course should help Darren Caldwell, 22, escape his criminal past. \"Two years for car theft was the big one,\" he says. \"I thought that was it. People don't want to give you a job with that on your book.\" </p> <p>Caldwell believes that working alongside other construction workers and trainers in the scheme is helping raise his expectations and build confidence. \"They treat you with respect. They're on \u00a3200 and I'm on \u00a355 a week but they'll buy you a drink and treat you as an equal because we're helping them on the job.\" </p> <p>The YBT was set up 10 years ago by Kenneth Claxton, an architect who reckoned that a link between self-build and social housing could solve two problems at once - lack of qualifications and homelessness in the very young. \"Brighton council asked me: 'What's the youngest age that someone can build their own house?' I thought it was an interesting question - and it led to us establishing YBT.\" </p> <p>So far, the trust has probably helped about 300 people, financed from a variety of sources including the Housing Corporation, the Department for Education and Employment, the YMCA and European Social Fund. But similar projects in Europe are soaring ahead of us, claims Claxton. \"The Germans are beating us hollow. They've been running this sort of scheme for 20 years and doing brilliantly.\" </p> <p>Last week, Mo Mowlam spoke at the Youthbuilding 2000 conference in Birmingham and handed over the National Young Builders Award to Jason Stanton, 22. \"It was unanimous,\" says Claxton. \"Jason has travelled the greatest distance that anyone can: he was 21, homeless and beset by personal problems. He's completed an NVQ part II and sent us a handwritten note describing what he'd got out of YBT. You couldn't but be convinced of his deserving the award.\" </p> <p>For Telfer, the Jason Stantons are rare. But successes like him repay the hard work of the YBT team. \"They're like salmon,\" says Telfer. \"Only a few will make it. But if any do it's a fantastic achievement for them and us.\" </p> <p> <strong> The joy of starting a new life</strong><br></p> <p> Jason Stanton, winner of the Young Builders Award, completed a year's training with the Youth Build Trust in Norwich and now lives in the house he built as part of his training course. </p> <p>\"I was living in a night shelter, and in those places it's hard to avoid alcohol and drugs,\" says, Jason, aged 22. \"I've had my own problems with both. I've been in prison for four months on weapons offences and, to be honest, I've been in trouble for a long time. I was at a boarding school for my behaviour problems; there was trouble at home with violence and family break-up. So that was how I came to be in the night shelter. </p> <p>\"I got on the YBT scheme through being on the dole and then New Deal. I'd never done a training course before, never had a full-time job and I was nervous. I also had an attitude problem, I always have had. But I think there was support at YBT and they helped me move from the night shelter to the YMCA where I had my own room. I also met my fiancee, and she and her family have given me loads of support. It's been hard at times, but I've got friends now. I've a lot more confidence in myself; I've learnt a trade and that's really fantastic. We moved into the house I built with YBT last March. To say it's satisfying is the biggest understatement. It's a lovely house. I'd never have got anything like this without doing the scheme. </p> <p>\"I'm not working in construction at the moment because I haven't got my driving licence yet and you need one. So in the next three or four months I'll try to get that and ultimately, I'd like to have my own carpentry and joinery business. I'd never thought it possible. I cried when they told me I'd won the award, but doing the scheme changed my life around.\"</p>",

The government's social services inspectorate (SSI) is calling for improved training in disability awareness and disability rights to enable staff to do more to help clients achieve independence. </p> <p>The inspectorate is voicing particular concern over the direct payments scheme, by which people with disabilities can be given cash to organise their own care packages. Just days after social services directors trumpeted the growing success of the scheme, the report says it is taking off too slowly. Although more and more councils are introducing direct payments, actual numbers taking them up remain low in many areas. </p> <p>The new arrangements are aimed at giving disabled people increased choice and power through a more flexible service. But the report says \"most councils and staff still have fully to absorb and carry through the independent living philosophy\". </p> <p>Denise Platt, SSI chief inspector, says: \"It is clear that direct payments are a good way for many people to achieve a sense of control over their life. We must therefore do everything possible to promote these services and to make independent living a reality.\" </p> <p>The report, New Directions for Independent Living, comes hard on the heels of figures from the Association of Directors of Social Services, suggesting that more than 3,600 disabled people aged 18-65 were receiving direct payments under the discretionary system introduced in 1997. Now, a team of SSI inspectors, which studied 10 local authorities in England, declares it is \"disappointed at the limited progress\" made by most of the sampled councils. In some cases, the team felt staff were ambivalent about the new scheme and had \"not fully assimilated principles of independent liv ing into their practice\". </p> <p>One social worker told the inspectors: \"I am very worried about direct payments - vulnerable people managing their own services.\" Another asked if it was right to \"risk\" such payments. Other staff were either unfamiliar with the legislation, or lacked knowledge of the specific local procedures for arranging direct payments in their area. </p> <p>Sian Vasey, an officer at the National Centre for Independent Living, says people with disabilities need support to access direct payments. \"It can be a bit of a hassle to sort out, but once you've set things up it means you can fine-tune the services to exactly what you want. I use the money to pay people to get me up in the morning and it's useful if you want to go away overnight as you can pay someone to go with you. </p> <p>\"The next battleground is going to be ensuring that the direct payments cash is enough to meet your needs. I know some people who can afford to fund a personal assistant to get them up, but then there's not enough cash to enable them to do anything or go anywhere for the rest of the day.\" </p> <p>Marion Harrington, head of commissioning elderly and disabled services for Westminster council, says that to deal with the \"hassle factor\", her authority has brought in a voluntary organisation to sort out issues such as tax and national insurance for disabled people who effectively become employers if they use direct payments. </p> <p>\"Otherwise it would be a huge amount of work for social workers and care managers. It is compli cated, so clients have to be quite motivated to want to take it on,\" Harrington says. \"We've found it's mainly those at the higher end of the needs spectrum who have done so. Among those who have found it particularly useful are people who want to employ carers who speak their language or understand their particular cultural needs.\" </p> <p>The inspectorate is highlighting a lack of clear eligibility criteria for direct payments. It criticises some authorities for operating blanket exclusions of certain user groups, or limiting the scheme to just one group such as people living with Aids/HIV, instead of making decisions on an individual basis. </p> <p>In the main, the inspection team found that individuals making use of direct payments were more satisfied than those receiving services arranged by the council. By recruiting and employing their own staff, clients reported having more flexibility, enjoying a more reliable service and feeling more in control. One user commented: \"It's just turned everything around - it has given me self-respect.\" </p> <p>In general, though, the SSI found that many individuals with disabilities were being offered services in a piecemeal and fragmented way \"with few areas being able to demonstrate joined-up approaches at all levels and across all services\". In the 10 inspected councils, support for people with physical disability lagged behind arrangements for individuals with learning disabilities. </p> <p>In terms of good practice, the inspectors single out Calderdale, West Yorkshire, where social services has put together very intensive care packages to support some extremely dependent people in their own homes. </p> <p> \u0095 New Directions for Independent Living - Inspection of Independent Living Arrangements for Younger Disabled People is available free from DH Publications, PO Box 777, London SE1 6XH</p>",

In the main, the inspection team found that individuals making use of direct payments were more satisfied than those receiving services arranged by the council. By recruiting and employing their own staff, clients reported having more flexibility, enjoying a more reliable service and feeling more in control. One user commented: \"It's just turned everything around - it has given me self-respect.\" In general, though, the SSI found that many individuals with disabilities were being offered services in a piecemeal and fragmented way \"with few areas being able to demonstrate joined-up approaches at all levels and across all services\". In the 10 inspected councils, support for people with physical disability lagged behind arrangements for individuals with learning disabilities. In terms of good practice, the inspectors single out Calderdale, West Yorkshire, where social services has put together very intensive care packages to support some extremely dependent people in their own homes. \u0095 New Directions for Independent Living - Inspection of Independent Living Arrangements for Younger Disabled People is available free from DH Publications, PO Box 777, London SE1 6XH",

He photocopied it for me. Isn't it great?\" All the scheme's participants are under 25; most have struggled with school, vanished from other training courses, are without a secure home and have, in some cases, drifted into crime. </p> <p>Her small, freshly-painted office in Hackney, east London, and the cheque fluttering on the cork board are evidence, says Kaur, that the work of the Youth Build Trust (YBT) can help where other training courses have failed. \"This isn't just training; it's a guaranteed job and, perhaps more importantly, a home - somewhere secure to live at the end.\" </p> <p>It is the housing element of the YBT scheme, currently running at 11 sites in Britain, that makes it unique. Young people who are unemployed and in housing need are given the chance to train in construction, get National Vocational Qualification I and II, a job at the end of the course and the chance to live in the house they build, or to apply for alternative accommodation through the housing association where they are working. </p> <p>\"Here they're doing the work for real,\" says temporary training manager Dave Telfer. It's not like college where you have a go for five minutes on a test bench,\" Building accommodation for a YBT colleague or for the YBT itself - Kaur's office is being refurbished by her team - is an important part of the motivation for most participants. </p> <p>There is also more support than you would expect on the average training course. Elaine McGlone is the support worker for the first YBT project in Scotland, which was started earlier this year in Paisley. \"I used to be a nurse and then worked for Dr Barnardo's, but this really stretches me - I'm their advocate,\" she says. McGlone deals with court visits, probation officers and can help trainees find accommodation. \"And I can just help and encourage when they get out of bed the wrong way and feel rubbish.\" </p> <p>Most of the participants are no angels, she says. Many have been in trouble with the police and dodged school for years, but only by giving them intense support can she be sure that those who are capable will complete the course. </p> <p>Twenty-year-old Joe Allan began skipping school at the age of 12. He says: \"I've been on four training courses and always dropped out. I knew they were just six months out of the dole. But this was worthwhile from day one. I haven't missed a day's work. This is real work, not training.\" </p> <p>For others, a criminal record has seemed an insuperable barrier to finding work. The guaranteed job at the end of the YBT course should help Darren Caldwell, 22, escape his criminal past. \"Two years for car theft was the big one,\" he says. \"I thought that was it. People don't want to give you a job with that on your book.\" </p> <p>Caldwell believes that working alongside other construction workers and trainers in the scheme is helping raise his expectations and build confidence. \"They treat you with respect. They're on \u00a3200 and I'm on \u00a355 a week but they'll buy you a drink and treat you as an equal because we're helping them on the job.\" </p> <p>The YBT was set up 10 years ago by Kenneth Claxton, an architect who reckoned that a link between self-build and social housing could solve two problems at once - lack of qualifications and homelessness in the very young. \"Brighton council asked me: 'What's the youngest age that someone can build their own house?' I thought it was an interesting question - and it led to us establishing YBT.\" </p> <p>So far, the trust has probably helped about 300 people, financed from a variety of sources including the Housing Corporation, the Department for Education and Employment, the YMCA and European Social Fund. But similar projects in Europe are soaring ahead of us, claims Claxton. \"The Germans are beating us hollow. They've been running this sort of scheme for 20 years and doing brilliantly.\" </p> <p>Last week, Mo Mowlam spoke at the Youthbuilding 2000 conference in Birmingham and handed over the National Young Builders Award to Jason Stanton, 22. \"It was unanimous,\" says Claxton. \"Jason has travelled the greatest distance that anyone can: he was 21, homeless and beset by personal problems. He's completed an NVQ part II and sent us a handwritten note describing what he'd got out of YBT. You couldn't but be convinced of his deserving the award.\" </p> <p>For Telfer, the Jason Stantons are rare. But successes like him repay the hard work of the YBT team. \"They're like salmon,\" says Telfer. \"Only a few will make it. But if any do it's a fantastic achievement for them and us.\" </p> <p> <strong> The joy of starting a new life</strong><br></p> <p> Jason Stanton, winner of the Young Builders Award, completed a year's training with the Youth Build Trust in Norwich and now lives in the house he built as part of his training course. </p> <p>\"I was living in a night shelter, and in those places it's hard to avoid alcohol and drugs,\" says, Jason, aged 22. \"I've had my own problems with both. I've been in prison for four months on weapons offences and, to be honest, I've been in trouble for a long time. I was at a boarding school for my behaviour problems; there was trouble at home with violence and family break-up. So that was how I came to be in the night shelter. </p> <p>\"I got on the YBT scheme through being on the dole and then New Deal. I'd never done a training course before, never had a full-time job and I was nervous. I also had an attitude problem, I always have had.

A male colleague was treated for shock. No one has claimed responsibility but the first minister, David Trimble, said local police chiefs recently warned about increased activity among dissident republican paramilitaries the Real IRA, which carried out the Omagh bombing. \"There was a warning from the local superintendent some weeks ago about Real IRA activity there,\" he said. \"It's a reminder to us that there is still a significant terrorist threat and consequently anything that is done with regard to changes in policing has to be looked at very carefully to make sure that the capability and effectiveness of the RUC is not in any way diminished.\" Local politicians on all sides condemned the bombing.

The RUC chief inspector William Dorman said: \"This is a totally reckless, unwarranted attack, not only against my officers but the community as a whole. \"The officers had returned to the station for a short, well-earned break after an extremely busy Halloween night when the attack took place.\" Mr Trimble has banned Sinn Fein ministers from attending North/South council meetings in a bid to force the IRA to move on disarmament, but furious republicans said it would not work. The health minister, Bairbre de Brun, of Sinn Fein, will decide today what to do over a planned meeting on food safety with her Dublin counterpart Michael Martin in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, on Friday. The prime minister, Tony Blair, and the Irish premier, Bertie Ahern, have already had telephone talks on the fresh crisis which threatens to envelope the peace process. The blast at Castlewellan Royal Ulster Constabulary station came just hours after two Protestants were shot dead in north Belfast in separate attacks linked to the loyalist feud. Progressive Unionist worker Bertie Rice, 63, and 39-year-old former Ulster Democratic Party member Tommy English were both murdered in their homes yesterday. The killings, just three days after the murder of Ulster Defence Association member David Greer, 21, mark the re-ignition of the bloody feud between two rival loyalist factions. The bitter row between the Ulster Volunteer Force, politically represented by the PUP, and the Ulster Defence Association/Ulster Freedom Fighters, represented by the UDP, has already claimed three lives in the past few months. UDP leader Gary McMichael today appealed for dialogue between the two sides. He said: \"The UDA and UVF need to sit down and sort themselves out. \"There needs to be a truce formalised or it (violence) will inevitably appear somewhere else.\" The feud erupted in the summer in the Shankill Road area, where more than 200 families have been driven from their homes in what appeared to be a territorial dispute. But now, fresh arguments have broken out between individual paramilitaries in the north of the city. However, sources said Mr Rice and Mr English were \"soft targets\" without direct involvement in the dispute.

      "bodyText": "As Israelis and Palestinians today tried to arrange their first high-level, face-to-face talks in six weeks, violence continued on the West Bank with troops and gunmen from both parties exchanging heavy fire. According to hospital officials, two Palestinians were killed and twelve wounded in a firefight in Al Khader, near Bethlethem, when Israeli helicopter gunships fired missiles at the village in retaliation for earlier losses. An Israeli security source said the helicopters were being used to evacuate the Israeli casualties. Abu Dhabi television reported that two Israelis had been killed and four wounded. Three Palestinians, two of them aged 15 and 17, were also killed in clashes at the Karni crossing between Israel and the Gaza Strip, medical officials said, adding to the three Palestinians killed in the area yesterday. The death toll in nearly five weeks of violence now stands at 159, not including the two Israeli soldiers whose deaths have not been confirmed by the army. Most were Palestinians or Israeli Arabs. The Israeli army also reported firing shells at the Palestinian village of Beit Sahour, also near Bethlehem, in response to gunfire and retaliating to violence against the Jewish settlement of Gilo, near Jerusalem. \"It is possible we will decide that military steps taken so far have not been enough,\" warned Danny Yatom, a senior aide to the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak. \"Today, there was a very negative jump in the scope and severity of events.\" Meanwhile Shimon Peres, Israel's elder statesman, said he will hold talks with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Wednesday or Thursday to try to clear the air after 35 days of fighting. Barak and Arafat both attended a US-sponsored Middle East summit in Egypt on October 17, but refused to meet face-to-face. Peres, who as the architect of Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking has spent many hours negotiating with Arafat, said he did not have high expectations for his meeting with the Palestinian leader. He told Israel army radio: \"I just think that, even when there is shooting, we need to talk.\" Israel's top peace negotiator Gilead Sher will also participate in the meeting, expected to be held in Bethlehem. Israeli foreign minister Shlomo Ben-Ami and Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat are due to meet separately this week with US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, as part of American efforts to end the fighting and renew the peace process. Erekat said he will present a letter to Clinton with four Palestinian demands, including international protection and the establishment of an international inquiry commission into the violence. Arafat met with German chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der in Gaza City today, saying he was grateful for the visit \"at a time when we are subjected to military attacks.\" He said Germany had agreed to treat 50 wounded Palestinians, including several who are in serious condition. The Palestinian leader asked for greater European involvement in peace talks. \"We are looking for a German stance, a European stance to push the peace process forward, to protect the peace process,\" Arafat said in a joint news conference with Schr\u00f6der. But Germany has declined any further involvement, limiting its role to financial aid. In the Gaza Strip, more than 20,000 Palestinians joined a funeral for five of seven Palestinians killed in the past two days at the Karni crossing. The crowd repeated slogans shouted over a loudspeaker mounted on the lead truck: \"Goodbye, martyrs, we will meet in paradise. We will take revenge against the Israelis, and this will happen soon.\" Related stories Palestine unfazed by Israeli rockets Jemima Khan - tell the truth about Israel Interactive map of Israel Special report: Israel and the Middle East Useful links Israeli report 2000 - Amnesty International US Department of State - Middle East peace process TheTruthAboutIsrael.com Clashes Information Centre",

It trims to the moralisers while boasting of socially progressive policies. It bends to business, while expressing angst about over-worked parents - something to annoy everyone. Why never a clear principle? </p> <p>The committee designed to anchor the government's family values was seized by the strong male arm of the Home Office, instead of tucked under the protective wing of Health. But the \"family\" needed the smack of firm discipline, the aura of parenting orders. The paper's one redeeming feature is that it has plainly been tugged in two warring directions amid much disputation. It's easy to imagine Patricia Hewitt, Margaret Jay, Margaret Hodge, Patricia Hollis - women being the liberalisers in this government - tugging for sensible practical policies, while Jack Straw, Paul Boateng, Alan Howarth and the men demand tin-eared cheap moralising. </p> <p>So this is the result: you wonder anyone can still write without irony: \"The government believes the family is the basic building block of our society.\" Sententiously it proclaims that happy two-parent families are best - but tugging the other way, it adds, \"However, we know that other family structures can also be successful.\" It ping-pongs on this, getting nowhere. Who is this for? It is the kind of empty talk that makes politics mocked, a foggy code in a game far from life as lived nightly in soap operas or on the sofas where real families watch them. </p> <p>A confusing string of facts has been assembled, thrown in by the committee's two opposing sides. Absorb these: 72% of families are headed by married couples, only 12% by a cohabiting couple. (Many of these must be old.) Lone motherhood has trebled to 22% (panic?). Last year saw the fewest marriages ever recorded (40% of them are remarriages, do they count?). The government actuary predicts a doubling of cohabitation in 20 years. By 2011, 39% of men and 31% of women will never marry. Two warring sentences about one another: \"Children brought up by two birth parents had higher levels of life satisfaction, fewer psychological problems.\" But this is immediately countered by: \"Children brought up in re- structured families without care experience or early disadvantage did not differ significantly from those brought up by birth parents.\" </p> <p>All this is just a way of saying the blindingly obvious: children with either one or two parents do fine in stable, loving surroundings. Children with fighting parents, children in care or brought up cripplingly poor are at higher risk. All that matters is how many more or fewer children are in danger of serious emotional or physical deprivation - whatever their families. </p> <p>What is the magic that politicians pretend to see in the marriage certificate? It increasingly eludes the present generation of parents where 40% of babies are now born outside marriage, but mainly to cohabitees. The \"building block\" and \"institution\" looks hollow to them and weddings an embarrassing sham. Four out of 10 marriages end in divorce. </p> <p>There is a whole chapter on domestic violence, reflecting the same figures Scotland Yard announced last week: two women a week killed, a violent attack reported every minute and unreported every six seconds. But the government's rosy picture of ideal marriage never links these two together. If one in four women is attacked by her partner, half of them repeatedly in front of their children, isn't escape and bringing up children alone a better choice for that 25% of \"families\"? Single motherhood is often a cause to celebrate, an escape forbidden in the bad old days. </p> <p>\"We are not telling people how to live their lives, and even if we wanted to, we couldn't make it happen,\" says the paper, but its tone says otherwise. Jack Straw would like to tell people how to live their lives, though he has no more sticks and whips to crack families into line than did the back-to-basics Tories. William Hague's puny whip is to restore the \u00a3285 a year married couples allowance, as if that will get wicked cohabitees galloping up the aisle. What can Labour offer? This paper says that the (divorced) lord chancellor and the (divorced) Jack Straw are jointly producing a marriage information pack to give couples considering marriage. </p> <p>Here's the reality check. Chapter 3: What Families Want. Real families said it was after-school clubs, parks, streets closed to traffic and, above all, childcare. No one asked government for help with their marriage. Many specifically said they wanted no interference \"forced on the majority of caring, competent parents\". There is no electoral mileage in marriage. Nor will it fool the Daily Mail. They'll make mincemeat of this. Where's the beef, they'll ask? Where's the marriage-promoting policy? The Mail might enjoy a note under a blank section called Divorce and Relationship Breakdown, reading: \"Lord chancellor's department are unable to give any indication of what new initiatives may be taken forward in the area of divorce and relationship breakdown. Hopefully be in a position to provide some input in this area\". The answer, mercifully, is that there are no new initiatives in this area after the welcome abandonment of the impossible Tory divorce law reform. </p> <p>One section reveals how weak Labour is with employers on work/life balance, which strikes at the real heart of family life. Fathers with children aged under 11 work an average of 48 hours; a quarter work 50 hours. Mothers say they want flexi-time and term-time working, but Labour has left it to a voluntary campaign to persuade employers: no word of legislation here. </p> <p>Unless the ministerial group rewrites this paper, any brouhaha it attracts will focus on this marriage nonsense. The great bulk of the document will pass unnoticed - a shame since it contains a long list of all the good Labour is doing for children. More than a million have been lifted out of poverty, benefits are better, schools are improving, a national childcare strategy begins, with a host of unsung programmes that really might rescue children from failure. </p> <p>To promote these, why not call this paper \"Our Nation's Children\" or some such? Leave marriage, cohabiting and single parents alone. Be bold in mocking politicians who preach to empty pulpits. Make a virtue of high-spending practical policy over Tory sermonising that thinly camouflages their planned cuts in all such children's projects. It would be good to hear this draft was ditched long ago: of course no family values nonsense will mar the group's new paper on children.</p>",

On Friday, Krikalev will start working on a couple of bad batteries in the Zvezda living quarters, and his colleagues will try to organise the place to their liking. All the activities will be monitored by Russian Mission Control as well as by Nasa's Mission Control in Houston. Houston will take over control from Moscow once the American lab Destiny arrives in January with critical computer systems. The three men will call the space station home for four months, or until the end of February, when another three-person crew will take their place.",

      "bodyText": "Eric Cantona could be about to return to football as sports manager with his hometown club of Marseille, according to newspaper reports in France. Today's Le Parisien states that Cantona was offered the position on Monday. The role would make the former Manchester United striker responsible for all sporting matters, with sport manager Marcel Dib and club chairman Eric Di Meco removed from their posts . Brazilian Abel Braga would remain as coach of the club however. According to Le Parisien, Cantona is very interested in the position, but wants precise guarantees that he will be able to have a say in team affairs, and also have enough money to bring in new players during the winter break. Olympique Marseille have declined to comment on the report, which is the latest rumour to surround the troubled club. At present they lie in 15th place in the French first division, just one point above the relegation zone. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

They currently lie 15th in Le Championnat and are riddled with factionalism and internal dissent. And that's where Eric the peacekeeper comes in. Earlier this week, Cantona, who was born in Marseilles, met with the club's major shareholder Robert Louis-Dreyfus and was offered the job of sport manager, which would see him take responsiblity for all sporting matters at the club, except coaching the players. That would mean Marseille having to dismiss sport manager Marcel Dib and the club's chairman, Eric Di Meco.</p> <p>But even that won't be enough for Cantona. According to La Parisien, the Frenchman is very interested in the position, but only if all the cards are in his hands. In English, that means guarantees from the club about their spending power, his decision-making powers, and a cast-iron that he can bring new players in during the winter break. Which means Marseille's Brazilian coach Abel Braga Carlos da Silva could be on his way too. But three men falling by the wayside is surely a small price to pay for having Cantona back among football's flock - especially if he inspires the godly George Weah onto even greater acts of humanitarian work.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"You wouldn't mind so much if Sweden were one of the best football nations in the world and their coaches were hugely respected across the continent but clearly that is not the case\" - Chris Kamara, a pundit hugely respected across the continent, makes the points that matter.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>LOW LO AMO MAY GO</strong></p> <p>You've got to respect Rangers defender Lorenzo Amoruso.

Giving in would damage public services, he argued; a line that may be heard from Gordon Brown when he makes his key statement in a week's time.",

      "body": "<p>After 16 years of absence, my father came flying back into my life. He had left our family home when I was 11 after my parents divorced, emigrated to Australia with another woman, and terminated all contact with me and my sister Abigail. I knew very little about his new life - only the snippets of information that my grandparents gave us. So when my grandmother told me he was to visit the UK two months ago, the gaping hole he had left in my life - which I had been so busy ignoring for nearly two decades - was reopened. </p> <p>The ostensible reason for his visit was that my grandfather was very ill. But by making the journey back to England with his new wife and children, my father was, in a sense, returning to face the familial music. The picture I had of him in my head was of someone I disliked on principle. Yet how many times had I been told I was \"just like him\", forcing me to doubt myself? As I absorbed the idea that I could meet him if I wished, I felt a welling-up of bitter feelings that I thought had long since dissipated: his leaving me, not loving me, not caring enough to call or write. How could he have left his two little girls like that? </p> <p>Over the years, I had grown accustomed to his absence, and my passionate teenage anger had dulled to numbness. Now I instinctively felt that this shadowy figure on the periphery of our lives needed to be made real. While I feared that a meeting could at worst be traumatic for us, I also understood that this might be the only opportunity that my sister and I would be given to meet him; I knew we would regret it if we did not. </p> <p>We arranged the reunion with short, polite exchanges of correspondence, making it clear that we had no interest in meeting his wife, nor our half- brother and sister. In the weeks leading up to the arranged day, my nervous anticipation uncovered all the hurt and anger that I thought I had dealt with years ago. Powerful emotions elbowed their way into my day at inconvenient times: on the Tube, at my desk, in a restaurant. </p> <p>I was uncomfortably aware that my father was back in the same country again. As my subconscious went into panicked overdrive, I had vivid dreams about him. I wasn't sure that I was ready to confront him and felt unprepared for possible disappointment. I worried that he would be distant and unwilling to answer questions that we would need courage to ask. </p> <p>The day before we met, there were newspaper reports about a 14-year-old adopted girl who had killed herself because her natural father, whom she had spent four years tracing, did not want to know her. The emotional turmoil she must have suffered made us realise the risk we were taking: we had no idea what his reaction would be to us, nor ours to him. </p> <p>On the morning of the meeting, Abigail and I obsessed over how to greet him. We decided that to shake hands would be correct, for how could we embrace a stranger? Sitting in the caf\u00e9, half an hour early, I half expected my father of 1984 to walk in: a tall man, 6ft 3in, with dark curly hair and a moustache, who lived in his brown leather jacket. </p> <p>Abigail was the first to spot him: a slightly haggard-looking man, his hair and moustache now silver-grey, but still in a brown leather jacket. He couldn't see us at first, but when we stood up to greet him he came over and hugged us so fast that we couldn't proffer our hands instead. He had put on a lot of weight. And, ordering a vodka and Coke with more bravado than was necessary, he was clearly as nervous as we were. </p> <p>The polite chit-chat I had anticipated did not last long as he stumbled embarrassingly over our names, unaccustomed to using them to our faces. Launching into what he needed to say, he repeatedly attempted to explain why he had left. He said he had had to make a decision to leave our lives; with hindsight, he knew it was wrong. </p> <p>He said it had hurt him that we hadn't kept in touch, at which point I felt obliged to point out that it was not our responsibility to do that: he was the parent, after all, and we had been so young when he left. With more calmness than I felt, I told him how his actions had affected us, not only as children, but also in our adult lives. He insisted with great conviction that he was not the same man as he had been. Was he, I wondered, seeking our forgiveness? </p> <p>After suffering a breakdown (triggered, I learned later, by the birth of his daughter), he had had counselling for several years. He said he was now able to cry. So the past had caught up with him, I noted with satisfaction. Yet, even after he had admitted how his marriage to my mother had been wrecked by his philandering and immaturity, I could not help liking him. There were so many similarities between us - not just our temperaments but silly things, such as refusing to keep salt in the house. Despite my wariness, I found myself warming to him. </p> <p>My father talked about his new children a great deal, mentioning how disappointed they were at not being allowed to meet us. He said he never let them go to bed unhappy: \"I tell them not to worry about what happened in the day and that I love them. So we have a hug and kiss before they sleep.\" </p> <p>I caught myself thinking what a nice dad he was, this stranger sitting before me whose Aussie slang endearingly peppered our conversation. He seemed so much more emotionally open than I had ever expected, but as a father he had arrived 16 years too late. </p> <p>By the end of the afternoon, after such seemingly honest discussion, our small talk started to feel awkward. We had skirted around the possibility of meeting again; instead, we exchanged email addresses. At our leave-taking there were hugs and tears on all sides. I felt suddenly bereft when he walked out. As I accompanied Abigail back to Paddington station, we tried to make sense of what we felt. \"But I liked him,\" she told me in bewilderment. We had not been prepared for that. </p> <p>The pain over the next few days was akin to that at the end of a relationship, which, in a sense, it was. I had to relinquish some of my long-standing beliefs about my father. I had to try to find a place for the idea that he was a nice person, someone I had even felt affection for. This sudden change in my opinion of him surprised those around me; I almost felt that I was not allowed to like him. That disapproval made me wonder whether, in fact, it was my 11-year-old self that had responded so willingly to him. After all, she - not I, a mature, independent woman - was the one who needed a daddy. </p> <p>My sister and I both spoke to him again before he left. He was emotional over the phone as we discussed my grandfather's illness and how it was affecting his family. Although we spoke about such personal feelings, I felt no real closeness between us. I had not expected four hours together to repair 16 years of absence; however, I had, perhaps mistakenly, expected a father to have an automatic connection with his daughter. </p> <p>His other children have him as their dad and he is no longer ours: he forfeited that privilege long ago. We have begun to build a bridge between us, but a full relationship feels impossible with him living so far away. Maybe this new bond will be strengthened in the months to come; perhaps it will just fall away. Already, as my anger turns to sadness, I am forgetting him once more.</p>",

      "body": "<p>There was a rather surprising news item the other day. Professor Jonathan Gershuny of the Institute of Economic and Social Research, who has ploughed through tens of thousands of parents' diaries from 1961 to 1995, has concluded that British parents now spend more than four times as much time playing, doing homework or reading to their children. Moreover, we do more of this stuff than other nations. </p> <p>This is counter-intuitive, to put it mildly. One of the proudest symbols of our social and cultural isolation from the rest of the world is the fact that we Brits are not meant to like children. And if we do, we are not meant to show it. Certainly my father, on his biannual visits to see how my brother and I were getting on in the blacking factory, would affect a distant and austere manner, although we knew that his failure to recall our names, or indeed our faces, was simply a bluff designed to conceal his deep affection for us. To do otherwise would have been unmanly. </p> <p>Ah, but how things have changed. It definitely feels as though we have been putting the hours in - particularly since they closed down the blacking factory. Now everyone is giving their children what is amusingly called \"quality time\": 88 minutes a day for working fathers, as opposed to a brisk 11 minutes in 1961. Eighty-eight minutes a day for working fathers? Aren't they meant to be stuck on the M25? </p> <p>What's going wrong here? It's the precision of that detail in particular that makes me suspect there is something fishy about this research. Except that 88 minutes is, oddly enough, just about exactly as long as it takes to rewind and watch the Lion King again, with trailers. </p> <p>Parenthood is an awful responsibility, which is why I try to duck it as often as I can. I know one or two other men who are even more shiftless than I. But we do this not only because we are sick of perfect parents but for our own children's good: to make them autonomous, independent citizens who will look on us in our dotage with a mixture of indifference and contempt, the way you're meant to. The thing is that the kind of time spent with children is pretty much the same for both good and \"bad\" parents. I've broken it down roughly as follows: </p> <p>* 76% of the time is spent shouting at them. </p> <p>* 43% is spent saying, \"No\". (Or, more accurately, \"NO!!!!!\") </p> <p>* 42.999% is spent saying, \"Oh bloody hell, all right then.\" </p> <p>* 37% is spent not quite shouting at them. </p> <p>* 35% is spent wiping up after them. </p> <p>* 16% is spent in queues for funfair rides. </p> <p>* 15% is spent being rained on in public parks/the seaside/the country/on holiday in places which, prior to your visit, had never experienced a drop of rain at that time of year. </p> <p>* 8% is spent marvelling at the price of Brio train sets. </p> <p>You will have noticed that this adds up to rather more than 100%. Well, now you know why you don't go to the pub as often as you used to. And we have hardly scratched the surface, beneath which lurks the time spent telling them their dinner is ready, doing their homework (which contrives to be both rebarbatively inane and surprisingly complex at the same time), telling them their dinner is ready, the whole bathtime/bedtime business which we shall pass over in silence, scraping various excreta and disjecta off the carpet, telling them their DINNER IS READY, and pretending to be a monster for their edification and amusement. (Being a monster involves raising your arms above the head, shaping your hands into claws, and stalking after them making roaring noises. How children distinguish this from the normal disciplinary procedure is, frankly, beyond me.) </p> <p>That 88 minutes looms like a large rebuke. One wonders whether Ceridwen Roberts, of the Family Policy Studies Centre, has it right when she suggests that we may be spending more time with the kids, but it is (to paraphrase slightly) crap time. What researchers should bear in mind is the way one never has the reserves to deal with subsequent offspring the way one did with the first, when one was keen and full of bounce. </p> <p>For example, child number one had the alphabet rammed down her throat before she could crawl, and is now a pretty good reader, if I say so myself. Child number two, though, kind of missed out on all this, and the nearest I had got to such hot-housing with him was when I said the other day, \"Oh, that's a 'B', by the way.\" He is three-and-a-half. But why bother him with skills which will doubtless be redundant by the time he grows up? I've already taught him how to work the video.</p>",

And we have hardly scratched the surface, beneath which lurks the time spent telling them their dinner is ready, doing their homework (which contrives to be both rebarbatively inane and surprisingly complex at the same time), telling them their dinner is ready, the whole bathtime/bedtime business which we shall pass over in silence, scraping various excreta and disjecta off the carpet, telling them their DINNER IS READY, and pretending to be a monster for their edification and amusement. (Being a monster involves raising your arms above the head, shaping your hands into claws, and stalking after them making roaring noises. How children distinguish this from the normal disciplinary procedure is, frankly, beyond me.) That 88 minutes looms like a large rebuke. One wonders whether Ceridwen Roberts, of the Family Policy Studies Centre, has it right when she suggests that we may be spending more time with the kids, but it is (to paraphrase slightly) crap time. What researchers should bear in mind is the way one never has the reserves to deal with subsequent offspring the way one did with the first, when one was keen and full of bounce. For example, child number one had the alphabet rammed down her throat before she could crawl, and is now a pretty good reader, if I say so myself. Child number two, though, kind of missed out on all this, and the nearest I had got to such hot-housing with him was when I said the other day, \"Oh, that's a 'B', by the way.\" He is three-and-a-half. But why bother him with skills which will doubtless be redundant by the time he grows up? I've already taught him how to work the video.",

But things were difficult. Jon's brother and sister both had learning difficulties and were being taught in separate special schools, while Jon himself was hyperactive and always playing up.

Pundits often resort to the \"too close to call\" when it isn't (ie usually). That's partly cowardice or caution, but it's also a pardonable desire to make a real horse race out of a contest in which they have invested time and money.</p> <p>What's the point of, say, the BBC's Peter Snow saying \"That's it, you can all go to bed now, the Tories have won again\" as he could have done around 1am on election night in 1992. That was when the result came in at Basildon, a key marginal which David Amess held.</p> <p>Of course, he didn't say that.

Throughout that campaign I would ask Tory strategists \"How are you going to get out of this one?\" They would reply, a touch smugly, \"tax and Kinnock\", a tribute to the Labour leader's lack of perceived gravitas and (people forget this bit) John Smith's shadow budget.</p> <p>I came to the reluctant conclusion they were right and made sure the Guardian carried a \"Late Surge Give Tories Hope\" headline on polling day.

Everyone knew Labour would win, but most of us (Blair, Major and Ashdown included) reckoned on the basis of the 1992 experience that there would be a last minute drift back to the Tories. Far from it. Blair got the landslide that has caused him trouble ever since.</p> <p>In the US this November it's the closest I can remember since 1992 when Ross Perot's third party \"Reform\" candidacy helped deliver the White House to Bill Clinton at Bush Sr's expense, just as Ralph Nadar's Green challenge threatens to do the same to Vice President Gore.</p> <p>You knew Bush would beat Dukakis in 1988, you knew Reagan would beat Fritz Mondale in '84 and your strong hunch was that he'd oust Jimmy Carter after the humiliation of the Iranian hostage drama in 1980, the result, history may confirm, of a dirty deal with Tehran.</p> <p>The same pattern is there in British elections. Margaret Thatcher's three victories in '79, '83 and '87 were wholly predictable. Labour's Gerald Kaufman called the '83 manifesto \"the longest suicide note ever written.\"</p> <p>Ted Heath's defeat in the \"miners' election\" of February 1974 was a surprise to many. I thought: \"If you ask a daft question like 'Who governs Britain?', voters will reply, 'Evidently not you, chum.\" Oddly enough, I had a hunch that Heath would win in 1970 too: Harold Wilson was too complacent.</p> <p>French and German elections have thrown up their share of excitement. De Gaulle fell on a referendum, Helmut Kohl hung on too long - 16 years - and ensured that his successor lost to the SPD's Gerhard Schr\u00f6der. When President Jacques Chirac tried to pull a stunt with early parliamentary elections in 1998 he lost badly and was forced to make socialist Lionel Jospin his prime minister.</p> <p>It was a costly error which may allow Jospin to beat him for the presidency next time. Conversely Al Gore's reluctance to deploy Clinton's campaign magic until this week - fear of the ''sleaze'' factor or vanity? - may cost him dear on Tuesday night.</p> <p>Americans are also picking one-third of their 100 senators and the whole 435-strong House. The Democrats will try (and fail) to regain control of both. One of the many pleasures of being a foreign correspondent in the US is that American journalists are generous to outsiders. They even hand over exit poll data which the TV networks are unable to publish themselves until all the polling stations on the west coast are closed - lest the polls influence how people vote in California, as they are said to have done in 1980.</p> <p>Reagan was winning in the east and Californians, more than most, like to back a winner. They did. The result is - or was when I was a Washington correspondent - that a British reporter, armed with exit polls not being reported on US TV, can make braver predictions about the results instead of resorted to our old friend \"Too close to call.\"</p> <p>The joy of the Bush-Gore contest is that it is a real horse race. Instinct tells me Bush is going to win because people like him more and he's neutralised the widely held view that he's both intellectually inadequate and in the clutches of big business. But, hey, anything could happen. One slip on the hustings, one bomb in Tel Aviv, could make a landslide either way.</p> <p>Back in 1960 Senator Jack Kennedy beat vice-president Richard Nixon by 100,000 popular votes, the closest election in modern times. As everyone knows, the Republicans believed the Democratic machine bosses stole the election, probably in Chicago, though Nixon gallantly declined to press the charge himself. I was a bit young then, but in 1986 I visited \"Gentleman Jim\" Dunn, chairman of Chicago's legendary Cook County Democratic machine on other matters.</p> <p>Cook County is to the Windy City what Middlesex used to be to London, the local authority for most of the capital. With no prompting from me Gentleman Jim, by now an elderly charmer, reached into his drawer and produced a copy of the Illinois election returns for November 1960.</p> <p>His purpose was to prove to a visitor that his team hadn't stolen anything because the voting patterns \"downstate\" in the Republican rural areas were the same as in the Democratic strongholds in the city.</p> <p>It proves no such thing. Once a political machine know how many votes are needed to turn a minority into a majority it can organise them as it pleases. Still it was a grand election with a result that will resonate down the ages.</p> <p>Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, they were all flawed giants in those days, operating with Shakespearean hubris. Oh really? Like \"too close to call\" that's just another pundit's clich\u00e9.</p>",

One of the many pleasures of being a foreign correspondent in the US is that American journalists are generous to outsiders. They even hand over exit poll data which the TV networks are unable to publish themselves until all the polling stations on the west coast are closed - lest the polls influence how people vote in California, as they are said to have done in 1980. Reagan was winning in the east and Californians, more than most, like to back a winner. They did. The result is - or was when I was a Washington correspondent - that a British reporter, armed with exit polls not being reported on US TV, can make braver predictions about the results instead of resorted to our old friend \"Too close to call.\" The joy of the Bush-Gore contest is that it is a real horse race. Instinct tells me Bush is going to win because people like him more and he's neutralised the widely held view that he's both intellectually inadequate and in the clutches of big business. But, hey, anything could happen. One slip on the hustings, one bomb in Tel Aviv, could make a landslide either way. Back in 1960 Senator Jack Kennedy beat vice-president Richard Nixon by 100,000 popular votes, the closest election in modern times. As everyone knows, the Republicans believed the Democratic machine bosses stole the election, probably in Chicago, though Nixon gallantly declined to press the charge himself. I was a bit young then, but in 1986 I visited \"Gentleman Jim\" Dunn, chairman of Chicago's legendary Cook County Democratic machine on other matters. Cook County is to the Windy City what Middlesex used to be to London, the local authority for most of the capital. With no prompting from me Gentleman Jim, by now an elderly charmer, reached into his drawer and produced a copy of the Illinois election returns for November 1960. His purpose was to prove to a visitor that his team hadn't stolen anything because the voting patterns \"downstate\" in the Republican rural areas were the same as in the Democratic strongholds in the city. It proves no such thing. Once a political machine know how many votes are needed to turn a minority into a majority it can organise them as it pleases. Still it was a grand election with a result that will resonate down the ages. Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, they were all flawed giants in those days, operating with Shakespearean hubris. Oh really? Like \"too close to call\" that's just another pundit's clich\u00e9.",

The Antonov 26 aircraft burst into flames minutes after it left the town of Saurimo, 500 miles east of the Angolan capital, Luanda, the Portuguese news agency Lusa said. It is an area which has been a focus for fierce fighting between the army and the Unita rebel group which are engaged in a two-decade civil war. The crash happened \"in an area which is difficult to reach,\" Angola's civil aviation authority confirmed in a brief statement. Saurimo is located in thick jungle in one of Angola's main diamond-mining regions.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Drug testing of employees is increasingly common as large and small businesses try to identify workers using illegal substances. In many cases, the discovery of such use leads to instant dismissal. Yet the government is encouraging employers to offer jobs to former or recovering drug addicts. Is this a case of contradictory policies? </p> <p>There are good reasons why employers should respond positively to a request to give an addict a job. Research we have carried out in Glasgow shows there is one good reason in particular: helping an addict find work can make all the difference between their recovery and relapse. </p> <p>We interviewed dozens of addicts who had managed to overcome their dependence on illegal drugs. One thing that came through time and time again in their stories was the importance of building a sense of personal self worth. Years of drug use, it seemed, had not only broken relations with families and friends but had also, in most cases, broken the individuals themselves. </p> <p>Angela, who had been addicted to heroin for nine years, was typical. \"I was really sick of life revolving around drugs and just sick of the things I would do to get drugs, sick of drugs being the main thing in my life,\" she said. \"Drugs came before anything. They came before myself, the house, my family. I hated the folk I was associating with as well, the lifestyle. But I would still do it because I was getting the drugs. I hated the lying and the cheating, sleeping with folk I didn't like because they had drugs on them, and I just hated having no self-respect. I really hated myself.\" </p> <p>Once the initial pains of drug withdrawal are overcome, the recovering addict is faced with what is often a much greater challenge: to build a life that does not revolve around illegal drugs. One of the ways in which working can be so important for the recovering addict is in opening up the chance of meeting people who are not focused on illegal drugs. Such new-found friendships can present something of a challenge in their own right, as the addict faces the dilemma of when, or whether, to reveal the details of past drug use. Difficult as such decisions can be, they are an improvement on being known universally as an addict and having other addicts as the vast majority of your friends. </p> <p>Finding work is important in other ways too. If the devil finds work for idle hands, it is equally true that there is probably no greater temptation for addicts to resume using illegal drugs than sitting for hour after hour in a house or a flat with nothing to do. As Marion, another recovering addict, said: \"You can't just come off drugs and sit and do nothing. If you've got something constructive to do, that gives you something to concentrate on, to blank out the drugs.\" Bernadette, a third interviewee, agreed: \"I think if I hadn't been working, I would probably have stuck it two days. Working gave me something to focus on - if I hadn't been working I don't think I'd have lasted. I'd have been away chasing the drugs again.\" </p> <p> Another way in which work is important to the recovering addict is in allowing the person to develop a sense that, for the first time in their life, they have a future which stretches out further than their next hit. Work opens up a future of opportunities, of things to do, people to meet and places to go to. This sense of a future, which most of us take for granted, is in many instances entirely new for the recovering addict. </p> <p>It is easy to see why many employers are wary of responding positively to encouragement to assist recovering addicts by finding them work. Helping an addict is unlikely to be high on most employers' list of priorities. But it is difficult to overestimate the value of that help, where it is given. </p> <p>Our medical and social work services can do a lot to help people come off drugs, but they cannot build a life for the recovering addict. Nor can the addicts do that themselves unless they receive the help of those who can find them work. Yet none of us should have any illusion about what an employer is taking on when they give a recovering addict a job. The term \"recovering addict\" is favoured by addict self-help groups because it reminds everybody that relapse is an ever-present possibility. Each day of their life, the addict has to reaffirm their commitment to stay drug free.It is a war constantly fought, but never won. </p> <p>Falling back into using illegal drugs is an outcome made that much more likely if the addict is left on the margins of society, constantly looking up at the achievements of others but denied the opportunity to show what they are capable of themselves. The wider public may also be resistant to the idea of addicts being helped in this way.

      "bodyText": "Drug testing of employees is increasingly common as large and small businesses try to identify workers using illegal substances. In many cases, the discovery of such use leads to instant dismissal. Yet the government is encouraging employers to offer jobs to former or recovering drug addicts. Is this a case of contradictory policies? There are good reasons why employers should respond positively to a request to give an addict a job. Research we have carried out in Glasgow shows there is one good reason in particular: helping an addict find work can make all the difference between their recovery and relapse. We interviewed dozens of addicts who had managed to overcome their dependence on illegal drugs. One thing that came through time and time again in their stories was the importance of building a sense of personal self worth. Years of drug use, it seemed, had not only broken relations with families and friends but had also, in most cases, broken the individuals themselves. Angela, who had been addicted to heroin for nine years, was typical. \"I was really sick of life revolving around drugs and just sick of the things I would do to get drugs, sick of drugs being the main thing in my life,\" she said. \"Drugs came before anything. They came before myself, the house, my family. I hated the folk I was associating with as well, the lifestyle. But I would still do it because I was getting the drugs. I hated the lying and the cheating, sleeping with folk I didn't like because they had drugs on them, and I just hated having no self-respect. I really hated myself.\" Once the initial pains of drug withdrawal are overcome, the recovering addict is faced with what is often a much greater challenge: to build a life that does not revolve around illegal drugs. One of the ways in which working can be so important for the recovering addict is in opening up the chance of meeting people who are not focused on illegal drugs. Such new-found friendships can present something of a challenge in their own right, as the addict faces the dilemma of when, or whether, to reveal the details of past drug use. Difficult as such decisions can be, they are an improvement on being known universally as an addict and having other addicts as the vast majority of your friends. Finding work is important in other ways too. If the devil finds work for idle hands, it is equally true that there is probably no greater temptation for addicts to resume using illegal drugs than sitting for hour after hour in a house or a flat with nothing to do. As Marion, another recovering addict, said: \"You can't just come off drugs and sit and do nothing. If you've got something constructive to do, that gives you something to concentrate on, to blank out the drugs.\" Bernadette, a third interviewee, agreed: \"I think if I hadn't been working, I would probably have stuck it two days. Working gave me something to focus on - if I hadn't been working I don't think I'd have lasted. I'd have been away chasing the drugs again.\" Another way in which work is important to the recovering addict is in allowing the person to develop a sense that, for the first time in their life, they have a future which stretches out further than their next hit. Work opens up a future of opportunities, of things to do, people to meet and places to go to. This sense of a future, which most of us take for granted, is in many instances entirely new for the recovering addict. It is easy to see why many employers are wary of responding positively to encouragement to assist recovering addicts by finding them work. Helping an addict is unlikely to be high on most employers' list of priorities. But it is difficult to overestimate the value of that help, where it is given. Our medical and social work services can do a lot to help people come off drugs, but they cannot build a life for the recovering addict. Nor can the addicts do that themselves unless they receive the help of those who can find them work. Yet none of us should have any illusion about what an employer is taking on when they give a recovering addict a job. The term \"recovering addict\" is favoured by addict self-help groups because it reminds everybody that relapse is an ever-present possibility. Each day of their life, the addict has to reaffirm their commitment to stay drug free.It is a war constantly fought, but never won. Falling back into using illegal drugs is an outcome made that much more likely if the addict is left on the margins of society, constantly looking up at the achievements of others but denied the opportunity to show what they are capable of themselves. The wider public may also be resistant to the idea of addicts being helped in this way. There will be many who say that if any help is being offered in finding work, there are others more deserving of it. But even conceding that point, somewhere along the line we will need to offer help to recovering addicts if we are serious in tackling the drug problem. Drug testing of employees will continue to grow in a climate where people may fear the consequences of addicts driving our buses and trains, piloting our aircraft or serving in our military. These are all legitimate fears and drug testing in such circumstances is a way of increasing all of our safety. But if drug use automatically disqualifies an individual from any and every job, then there is very little prospect of recovery and many of those who may have been able to beat the dragon of their own addiction will fall back to their old ways. Those employers who have set aside their fears of employing recovering addicts can be quietly proud of what they are doing. They are never going to earn a fanfare for their initiative, but that is not their expectation. What they are looking for, and what we should all be looking for, is the quiet sense of achievement when a recovering addict has been able to build a life for themselves and can say: \"I am so much more than the addict I was\". \u0095 Jim McIntosh and Professor Neil McKeganey are respectively deputy director and director of the centre for drug misuse research at Glasgow University.",

After a lifetime in the printing trade, this grandfather of three has gone back to studying. \"I don't think age is important,\" he says. \"It's all totally relative.\" </p> <p>Which is why he has enrolled as a student mental health nurse at Luton university. Currently in his first year, he will be 58 when he qualifies. \"I've found something I am good at,\" he says with feeling. </p> <p>At a time when the health sector is crying out for more trained staff - the Department of Health is said to estimate the shortfall in mental health nurses in England as being close to 3,000 - his decision to join the nursing profession is timely; his commitment, absolute. </p> <p>Leedale, from Milton Keynes, recalls how he grew up with not even a spark of ambition, leaving grammar school with no qualifications. His father soon got him into the printing trade, where Leedale stayed until a couple of years ago. It was in the twilight years of his printing career that he first discovered his vocation. </p> <p>The son of a pharmacist, with a sister also in nursing, Leedale says he had always been interested in health- care and first aid. When he found out about Crossroads, a respite charity set up in the 80s by the old ITV flagship soap in memory of one of its leading actors, he began moonlighting. \"I had friends who had serious disabilities,\" says Leedale, who also has a granddaughter with cerebal palsy. \"When you know somebody like that in the community, you meet others with similar disabilities. </p> <p>\"I knew Crossroads helped them and I got interested in that type of care. The sort of shift I had in the printing industry meant I had plenty of time to fit in other things.\" </p> <p>When redundancy finally loomed, Leedale decided to sever links with printing for good and got a job as a healthcare assistant with the British Nursing Agency, working in a variety of settings. Soon, he began to feel frustrated. \"I wanted to know why I was doing what I was doing. Also, you see things that are wrong and you think you can do better but you can't comment unless you do it from a position of knowledge and strength.\" So with the support of colleagues and clients alike, Leedale decided to become a nurse. </p> <p>Having no qualifications was the first hurdle. Leedale found he could sit an academic aptitude test set by the UK Central Council, the regulatory body for nursing. He passed. With that under his belt, he was eligible to apply to nursing colleges, and was warmly accepted at Luton. </p> <p>\"My sister was thrilled to bits, but amazed, because of my age. To me it's a natural progression, but a lot of people are surprised.\" Although there are only five students in his year training to be mental health nurses, the first 18 months of study is a common foundation course shared with 39 other students who have opted for a career in general nursing. Leedale's training base is at Stoke Mandeville hospital, Buckinghamshire. </p> <p>While he claims that the academic demands test him to the limit, the fledgling student's grades suggest that he is more than coping with study, despite a 40-year gap. The biggest and less surmountable stressor is financial. \"They ask why people drop out of courses,\" he exclaims. \"A lot of it has got to be the financial pressure.\" </p> <p>As a mature student on a diploma course, Leedale receives a higher than usual bursary, but it is still far from ideal. </p> <p>His partner, Ann, is working longer hours to make up the difference. \"I would like to have more cash, for Ann not to work such long hours, for us not to worry about money so much. But I have no doubts about what I am doing.\" </p> <p>His younger counterparts, however, are not so sure. \"Some colleagues on my course are very focused, but others, now they are on the course, say: 'I don't know whether I really want to do this'.\" </p> <p>One obvious benefit Leedale brings to his training, is his ability to speak up. \"A lot of the others find they're being pushed around and ignored,\" he says. </p> <p>\"Perhaps because I'm that bit older, people are not inclined to do that to me so much.\" But like his colleagues, he finds that the encouraged practice of learning by observation does not happen as often as it should. \"Often you are used as part of the team, and are not being trained. You do the job that everyone would, in order to free up the trained staff for the more specialist roles.\" </p> <p> Leedale insists that he has no problem with taking instructions from his youngers. All he is interested in is becoming a fully qualified nurse. His immediate aim, on doing so, is to work on an acute mental health ward. \"I'm looking at it as a means of gaining good experience before I specialise. My aim is to increase my grades through practice and hopefully end up working in the community. Whether I achieve that, depends on what happens in mental health in the meantime.\" </p> <p>With official retirement only nine years away, Leedale remains sanguine. If health trusts don't keep him on after 65, he will go back to work for nursing agencies, which are less stringent about age limits. </p> <p>His advice to anybody else contemplating a budding career in the twilight years is this: \"Go for what you want, because throughout life you can miss a lot of opportunities which will never come around again. I know there are a lot of constraints, but if you sit down and set about things, there are often ways around them.\" </p> <p>For now, Leedale's biggest challenge is placating his younger daughter, who is about to get married. \"She's not impressed because on her marriage certificate she has to put her father's profession,\" he says. \"She doesn't want to put 'student'.\"</p>",

His immediate aim, on doing so, is to work on an acute mental health ward. \"I'm looking at it as a means of gaining good experience before I specialise. My aim is to increase my grades through practice and hopefully end up working in the community. Whether I achieve that, depends on what happens in mental health in the meantime.\" With official retirement only nine years away, Leedale remains sanguine. If health trusts don't keep him on after 65, he will go back to work for nursing agencies, which are less stringent about age limits. His advice to anybody else contemplating a budding career in the twilight years is this: \"Go for what you want, because throughout life you can miss a lot of opportunities which will never come around again. I know there are a lot of constraints, but if you sit down and set about things, there are often ways around them.\" For now, Leedale's biggest challenge is placating his younger daughter, who is about to get married. \"She's not impressed because on her marriage certificate she has to put her father's profession,\" he says. \"She doesn't want to put 'student'.\"",

It was easy for the psychologists in her case to do this, as the horrifying traumatic event that she experienced was a one-off and witnessed by others. The significance of this new diagnosis not only led to her getting different treatment, but to the potential for recovery. </p> <p>Unfortunately, the diagnosis of schizophrenia almost inevitably follows any hallucinatory experience, which leads the patient to believe that they have a disease from which they will never fully recover - itself a traumatic experience. I believe that in many cases the \"trauma\" leading to a diagnosis of schizophrenia has occurred early in the patient's life, is often ongoing in some form and, above all, has gone unrecognised, frequently affecting a particularly sensitive person at a time when they may be especially susceptible to it. </p> <p>Sadly, few psychiatrists are either willing or capable of unearthing such trauma. It is so much easier to stick on a label and prescribe drugs. </p> <p> <strong> Joan Woodward</strong></p> <p> psychotherapist,Birmingham <br></p> <p><strong> The TB question</strong><br> </p> <p> I was very interested to read about Ali Khalili and tuberculosis - partly because I worked alongside him until my retirement in 1990, and partly because I, too, had TB while working as a consultant in the NHS (Return of an old enemy, October 11). </p> <p>My own experience was somewhat different to his. In the first place, my chest X-ray was persistently normal. I virtually diagnosed myself in that I sent a specimen of sputum to the laboratory and, more or less as an afterthought, asked for TB bacilli to be looked for. </p> <p>Why did I get TB? Well, it is true that I was born in India but, as my name suggests, my genes are European. My symptoms started when I was skiing in Austria, after I had crashed and injured several tendons in my left leg and arm, but continued to ski in spite of quite severe pain. I had been working very hard and was probably in a sense \"run down\". I had also been exposed to contact with a tuberculous Indian patient not long before I developed the symptoms. </p> <p>It may be that Khalili's TB was as much a result of fatigue and stress as of his non-European genes. </p> <p><strong> Peter McMullin</strong></p> <p> Winchelsea, East Sussex <br></p> <p><strong> Housing the homeless</strong><br> </p> <p> It is with both fascination and dismay that I read about the ongoing debate over the sale of council housing (Dividing walls, October 18). </p> <p>This strategy has caused misery to many more than can be easily assessed. Having worked with homeless people in three major cities, it saddens me to see the same pattern repeated in them all. </p> <p>The market must be prepared to take some responsibility for those homeless people caught in the trap created by the need to make a fast buck. Amid all the talk about the new Human Rights Act, has anyone remembered that housing is a fundamental right? </p> <p>How about actually releasing the majority of the profit generated from the sale of council housing and actually doing something with it? If this is too radical, perhaps we could consider transferring public housing stock at more than little or no cost to the pseudo private sector, using funds generated to provide practical housing solutions for all our citizens. </p> <p><strong> Billy Gibson</strong></p> <p> Birmingham <br></p> <p><strong> Clarification</strong><br> </p> <p> I would be grateful if you would make it clear that the letter printed in my name on October 25 was written by me as honorary secretary of the London Labour Mayors' Association, although I believe that the London Association of Mayors would not disagree with my views. </p> <p><strong> Len Snow</strong></p> <p> London<br></p> <p>Write to Guardian Society, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER; or fax 020-7713 4154 or email <a href=\"mailto:society@theguardian.com\"> society@theguardian.com</a> Please supply your full address.

Joan Woodward psychotherapist,Birmingham The TB question I was very interested to read about Ali Khalili and tuberculosis - partly because I worked alongside him until my retirement in 1990, and partly because I, too, had TB while working as a consultant in the NHS (Return of an old enemy, October 11). My own experience was somewhat different to his. In the first place, my chest X-ray was persistently normal. I virtually diagnosed myself in that I sent a specimen of sputum to the laboratory and, more or less as an afterthought, asked for TB bacilli to be looked for. Why did I get TB? Well, it is true that I was born in India but, as my name suggests, my genes are European. My symptoms started when I was skiing in Austria, after I had crashed and injured several tendons in my left leg and arm, but continued to ski in spite of quite severe pain. I had been working very hard and was probably in a sense \"run down\". I had also been exposed to contact with a tuberculous Indian patient not long before I developed the symptoms. It may be that Khalili's TB was as much a result of fatigue and stress as of his non-European genes. Peter McMullin Winchelsea, East Sussex Housing the homeless It is with both fascination and dismay that I read about the ongoing debate over the sale of council housing (Dividing walls, October 18). This strategy has caused misery to many more than can be easily assessed. Having worked with homeless people in three major cities, it saddens me to see the same pattern repeated in them all. The market must be prepared to take some responsibility for those homeless people caught in the trap created by the need to make a fast buck. Amid all the talk about the new Human Rights Act, has anyone remembered that housing is a fundamental right? How about actually releasing the majority of the profit generated from the sale of council housing and actually doing something with it? If this is too radical, perhaps we could consider transferring public housing stock at more than little or no cost to the pseudo private sector, using funds generated to provide practical housing solutions for all our citizens. Billy Gibson Birmingham Clarification I would be grateful if you would make it clear that the letter printed in my name on October 25 was written by me as honorary secretary of the London Labour Mayors' Association, although I believe that the London Association of Mayors would not disagree with my views.

The roots lie in his political formation in the labour movement. Old Labour was a producerist tendency, there to defend the rights of workers and eradicate poverty through wealth redistribution. </p> <p>New Labour saw that modern societies required a more sophisticated approach. It spoke to and for employers as well as employees, and realised that people also consume goods and services. As good social democrats, New Labour believed scientific materialisation and economic growth were the cure for poverty. Environmentalism was at best seen as an eccentric sideshow, and at worst against business, against science and against the poor. </p> <p>These are myths. But Blair and his advisers have believed them. Hence, New Labour never embraced environmental priorities, and Blair has yet to deliver his election promise to \"put environmental concerns at the heart of policy-making\". </p> <p>Blair's speech contained a sharp and intelligent analysis of how environmental action is good for the economy and business. But if he genuinely \"wants to push green issues back up the political agenda\", he has a lot to do. </p> <p>First, he must recognise that sustainability really is the next big idea in politics. Political leadership on the environment now means working out how to replace free-market capitalism, as capitalism displaced communism. Environmentalists now know that humanity has to learn to live within ecosystem limits. </p> <p>Second, greens believe in fair shares of natural resources for everybody. If climate change places a limit on the safe production of greenhouse gases, then permitted emissions must be shared between north and south, with greater reductions in the north to help poor and vulnerable societies. </p> <p>Third, greens recognise the moral claims of future generations. Our consumption and development pressures must be restrained accordingly. </p> <p>It is easy to caricature these beliefs as anti-business. In private, this is indeed what Blair has said about environmentalists, particularly during the debates on global trade, the World Trade Organisation and GM foods (\"I am neither pro nor anti this technology\" said Blair last week, eyes darting around the room to see if his audience bought this remarkable assertion). In a classic and depressing New Labour spin operation before the big speech, Alistair Campbell briefed the media that his boss would be attacking green \"dogmatism\". Afterwards, other acolytes ran around denying any such intention. </p> <p>Blair is certainly a pragmatic politician. What his heart does not naturally understand, his head may be forced by events to apprehend.

The awkward truth is that politicians who turn their backs on environmental problems find that they rise up and bite them hard in the bum. </p> <p>As New Labour learnt over GMOs, fuel taxes and rural issues, so in the US the Democrats are discovering similar political lessons for themselves. Al Gore faces defeat because of the insurgent campaign of the green Ralph Nader in crucial states like California. Gore and the New Clinton Democrats have only themselves to blame for Nader's appeal. Clinton also promised that the environment would be at the heart of government, and he did not deliver. </p> <p>In Europe, environmentalism has often found a voice in government because of proportional electoral systems and the consequent rise of credible green parties. But Britain's, or at least England's, arthritic political system makes this almost impossible. </p> <p>So what can Mr Blair do to turn his green problems around? </p> <p>First, he must produce a programme for Labour's second term that promotes radical green policies in every sector, from a dematerialisation of the economy, to organic and environmental farming, to granting fundamental environmental rights to all citizens. The usual bland pabulum produced by Millbank policy wonkers will not do. He must spell out targets and timetables, polluter tax programmes and recycled revenue spending. That is how to provide the environmental services and products that enable consumers to go green conveniently (which he said he wanted). </p> <p>Second, he must lead on the international stage, and help forge a partnership between north and south. In the climate debate, the most backward country is the US. Whether Gore or Bush wins, Blair should use Britain's \"special relationship\" to persuade the US to join Europe in implementing the Kyoto agreement. </p> <p>Finally, Blair must abandon the quaint notion that business will suddenly green itself. He pleaded with environmentalists to enter into partnership with industry, praising business leaders for their alleged environmental credentials. But FOE and other environmental groups already have constructive discussions with business leaders, even with companies who have been campaign targets for many years. That is part of successfully persuading business to change. Generally, industry does not welcome environmental initiatives. Having fought to replace environmental regulations with market mechanisms as their preferred policy approach, big business has sought to dismember every new environmental tax measure from the fuel duty escalator to the climate change levy. </p> <p>Blair drew attention to the huge and growing market in environmental goods and services, although he didn't mention that Britain lags behind Germany and Japan in market share. That will not change without vigorous government intervention, including regulation, legislation, taxation and public investment. </p> <p>Environmental issues are coming to dominate the political landscape, at home and internationally. For all Blair's idealistic talk about constructive partnerships, there is unlikely to be any cosy consensus over the way forward. Environmental politics has to be hard-ball politics, because it is about managing fundamental change. It means deciding how to curb the car, shift to green energy, ban unsafe synthetic chemicals, minimise wasteful consumption, sustainably harvest wild resources and regulate trade. That has to be the job of the government, because business and consumers will not do so unprompted. </p> <p>But the eventual prize is worth fighting for: a world where, as the prime minister put it, \"we can be richer by being greener, and by being greener we will enrich the quality of our lives\".

      "body": "<p>A psychiatric patient dying of cancer is being denied his wish not to be injected with powerful anti-psychotic medication. Ron Holbeche, who is diagnosed schizo- phrenic, has untreatable cancer in his abdomen and lower back muscles. He suffers such acute pain he finds it difficult to walk. Friends and family do not expect him to live longer than five months. </p> <p>With the support of his family, 57-year-old Holbeche has requested to be relieved of the Depixol injection he has been receiving for more than 10 years. He says that not only is it humiliating to have the compulsory injection into his wasted muscles, but it causes him additional pain. He also claims the powerful tranquiliser drains him of energy, preventing him from carrying out his one lifelong passion - painting. </p> <p>Holbeche has offered to take the medication in tablet form. But two nurses and a psychiatrist last week drove to his flat in Crediton, Devon, to inject him. He says he was told that if he did not accept the injection, he would be taken back to psychiatric hospital. </p> <p>The treatment has angered local mental health workers and Holbeche's family. They argue that it is unreasonable to continue injecting such strong medication into a seriously ill man. Holbeche's son, Kieron, who has been caring for his father, says: \"Since the injection, my dad's soul has been destroyed. He is hurt and depressed. His painting acts as his own kind of therapy and medication during this part of his life. All I want is for my dad to spend his last few days with dignity.\" </p> <p>Holbeche's circumstances are, however, different to those of most other psychiatric patients receiving anti-psychotic medication in injection form. He spent 14 years in secure psychiatric units, including Broadmoor hospital, after being convicted in 1976 of manslaughter with diminished responsibility. He had stabbed a man in a fight after being found sleeping with his girlfriend. </p> <p>In 1990, Hilbeche was conditionally discharged on a Home Office section and went to live in Crediton. He was told he must comply with psychiatric treatment designed to prevent him from \"relapsing\" and possibly becoming a risk to the public. </p> <p>Despite his past, however, Holbeche has been accepted into the local community and has held painting classes in homes for elderly people and for adults with learning disabilities. Known locally as \"Crow\", he has also had his own painting exhibitions in the town. He has not re-offended and has spent less than three weeks as an in-patient during the past 10 years. </p> <p>\"Crow is a well known and well-liked in the community,\" says Andrew Barkla, a worker with mental health charity Mind, in Exeter. \"He is good at talking and listening to people and is very respectful towards them. He fits in very well. In the nine years I have known him I have not had any sense that he presents any kind of risk to anybody.\" </p> <p>Exeter and District Community Health, the NHS trust responsible for Holbeche's treatment, says it does not discuss individual patient cases. But exchanges between his solicitor and the trust are continuing, with the former considering going to a mental health tribunal and then, if necessary, to judicial review. Holbeche is due to be given his next injection tomorrow. </p> <p>Barkla says that if the government goes ahead with its plans for community treatment orders (CTOs), there will be more cases of patients complaining of being compulsory medicated in their homes - despite ministerial assurances that people will not be injected over the kitchen table. </p> <p>\"Other patients living in the community may in the future be facing a similar situation as Crow,\" says Barkla. \"For many patients, hospital is the preferred place to have their injections, leaving home an environment where they can experience a sense of freedom and live a normal life. But what CTOs risk doing is making the whole world a psychiatric hospital.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "A psychiatric patient dying of cancer is being denied his wish not to be injected with powerful anti-psychotic medication. Ron Holbeche, who is diagnosed schizo- phrenic, has untreatable cancer in his abdomen and lower back muscles. He suffers such acute pain he finds it difficult to walk. Friends and family do not expect him to live longer than five months. With the support of his family, 57-year-old Holbeche has requested to be relieved of the Depixol injection he has been receiving for more than 10 years. He says that not only is it humiliating to have the compulsory injection into his wasted muscles, but it causes him additional pain. He also claims the powerful tranquiliser drains him of energy, preventing him from carrying out his one lifelong passion - painting. Holbeche has offered to take the medication in tablet form. But two nurses and a psychiatrist last week drove to his flat in Crediton, Devon, to inject him. He says he was told that if he did not accept the injection, he would be taken back to psychiatric hospital. The treatment has angered local mental health workers and Holbeche's family. They argue that it is unreasonable to continue injecting such strong medication into a seriously ill man. Holbeche's son, Kieron, who has been caring for his father, says: \"Since the injection, my dad's soul has been destroyed. He is hurt and depressed. His painting acts as his own kind of therapy and medication during this part of his life. All I want is for my dad to spend his last few days with dignity.\" Holbeche's circumstances are, however, different to those of most other psychiatric patients receiving anti-psychotic medication in injection form. He spent 14 years in secure psychiatric units, including Broadmoor hospital, after being convicted in 1976 of manslaughter with diminished responsibility. He had stabbed a man in a fight after being found sleeping with his girlfriend. In 1990, Hilbeche was conditionally discharged on a Home Office section and went to live in Crediton. He was told he must comply with psychiatric treatment designed to prevent him from \"relapsing\" and possibly becoming a risk to the public. Despite his past, however, Holbeche has been accepted into the local community and has held painting classes in homes for elderly people and for adults with learning disabilities. Known locally as \"Crow\", he has also had his own painting exhibitions in the town. He has not re-offended and has spent less than three weeks as an in-patient during the past 10 years. \"Crow is a well known and well-liked in the community,\" says Andrew Barkla, a worker with mental health charity Mind, in Exeter. \"He is good at talking and listening to people and is very respectful towards them. He fits in very well. In the nine years I have known him I have not had any sense that he presents any kind of risk to anybody.\" Exeter and District Community Health, the NHS trust responsible for Holbeche's treatment, says it does not discuss individual patient cases. But exchanges between his solicitor and the trust are continuing, with the former considering going to a mental health tribunal and then, if necessary, to judicial review. Holbeche is due to be given his next injection tomorrow. Barkla says that if the government goes ahead with its plans for community treatment orders (CTOs), there will be more cases of patients complaining of being compulsory medicated in their homes - despite ministerial assurances that people will not be injected over the kitchen table. \"Other patients living in the community may in the future be facing a similar situation as Crow,\" says Barkla. \"For many patients, hospital is the preferred place to have their injections, leaving home an environment where they can experience a sense of freedom and live a normal life. But what CTOs risk doing is making the whole world a psychiatric hospital.\"",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Do you floss regularly and visit your dentist at least twice a year? If not, you're in good company. More than half the population rarely, if ever, go for a dental check-up - and things are getting steadily worse. </p> <p>There are several reasons. One in five refuseniks say they are afraid of how much they will end up paying. Some, the dentally phobic, are simply afraid. Others just find the whole business of someone probing into their orifices distasteful. </p> <p>However, the most alarming reason why people fail to see a dentist is because they cannot find one - not on the NHS, that is. In recent years, there has been a haemorrhaging of dentists into private practice, to the point where, according to the British Dental Association, the health service is now 1,800 dentists short. A decade ago, dentists earned only 5% of their income from private work: today the proportion is nearer 25%. Not surprisingly, the market for private dental plans has been booming. </p> <p>For patients who cannot afford to go privately and - unlike children, pregnant women and those on benefit - are not covered by fee exemption rules, the situation is becoming acute. One third of health authorities have difficulty meeting the demand for NHS dental treatment, with the south and west of England among the worst hit. In Cornwall, where the service is largely privatised, long queues form outside surgeries whenever an NHS practitioner opens up. </p> <p>Even when people do find an NHS dentist - sometimes after travelling miles - the treatment is often second-rate compared to what is available privately. Root canal work and other time-consuming procedures are more likely to fail because of the penny-pinching rules governing NHS fees. Ill-fitting dentures, inferior filling materials and crowns, minimal preventive work, poorly matched veneers - the list goes on. </p> <p>The government is well aware of the shortage of NHS dentists, and the need to raise quality standards. After some delay, it has launched a new strategy, with additional funding attached, to help modernise the sector. The prime minister has pledged that by September next year everybody will be able to get NHS dentistry if and when they need it. </p> <p>So is this just another throwaway promise - like abolishing child poverty - that should not be taken too seriously? Or can it really be done? Junior health minister Lord Hunt, responsible for dentistry, emphasises that the government is putting \u00a3100m into enticing dentists back to the NHS, setting up \"phone and go\" dental access centres for non-registered patients and upgrading the service. But high street dentists say the figures do not stack up. </p> <p>\"The \u00a3100m figure is a myth,\" argues Anthony Kravitz, chief negotiator for general dental practitioners at the British Dental Association (BDA), \"because \u00a360m of it is coming from savings we've already agreed to make. It's not new money at all. And only a small percentage of dentists will gain from the incentive payments. The strategy does nothing to seriously address the shortage of NHS dentists.\" </p> <p>Nor, even assuming dentists can be found to run them, will expanding the number of walk-in centres solve the long-term problem of access to dental care. The British Dental Health Foundation sees it as a worrying move away from regular NHS check-ups and treatment towards quick-fix dental first aid. </p> <p>The reason for the exodus from NHS dentistry comes down largely to a question of money. Ever since the early 90s, when the Conservatives negotiated a new contract for dentists, the real value of the treatment fees paid to them by the NHS has been falling. Typically, a privately practising dentist can get a 50%-60% higher fee rate, so no wonder they are increasingly closing their doors to NHS work. The dental trade fairs are awash with money from this booming private sector, says Kravitz, and all the latest orthodontic treatments and hi-tech gizmos can be had for a price. But under our two-tier system, none of it is available on the NHS. </p> <p>Ian Wylie, incoming chief executive at the BDA, believes the skinflint policy on dental fees reflects the low priority given to oral health generally. \"It got barely a mention in the NHS national plan and dentists have felt increasingly marginalised over the years,\" he says. \"Investment in dentistry has in no way kept pace with the rest of the health service.\" </p> <p>Yet dental health is such a key barometer of overall welfare. Free dental check-ups, along with eye tests, were what everyone rushed to get when the NHS was founded. The state of the nation's teeth has since dramatically improved, but there are still huge social inequalities, and worrying signs - such as 20% fewer people registering with an NHS dentist since 1992 - that things are slipping into reverse. </p> <p>\"Dentists can help detect serious conditions such as oral cancer and arrest long-term problems connected to gum disease,\" says Wylie, who is moving from the King's Fund health policy institute, where he has been director of corporate affairs. \"There is mounting evidence of links between poor oral health and heart disease, premature births,and malnutrition in the elderly. But practitioners need the time to do their job properly; something that, with fee-per-item contracts determining hourly rates, is at a premium within the NHS.\" </p> <p>Interestingly, in dental health settings with different funding arrangements, both patients and practitioners report far higher satisfaction levels. In Ellesmere Port, South Cheshire health authority has been running a \"personal dental service\" - one of a number nationally - that pays dentists according to the number of patients registered, rather than cavities filled.

      "bodyText": "Do you floss regularly and visit your dentist at least twice a year? If not, you're in good company. More than half the population rarely, if ever, go for a dental check-up - and things are getting steadily worse. There are several reasons. One in five refuseniks say they are afraid of how much they will end up paying. Some, the dentally phobic, are simply afraid. Others just find the whole business of someone probing into their orifices distasteful. However, the most alarming reason why people fail to see a dentist is because they cannot find one - not on the NHS, that is. In recent years, there has been a haemorrhaging of dentists into private practice, to the point where, according to the British Dental Association, the health service is now 1,800 dentists short. A decade ago, dentists earned only 5% of their income from private work: today the proportion is nearer 25%. Not surprisingly, the market for private dental plans has been booming. For patients who cannot afford to go privately and - unlike children, pregnant women and those on benefit - are not covered by fee exemption rules, the situation is becoming acute. One third of health authorities have difficulty meeting the demand for NHS dental treatment, with the south and west of England among the worst hit. In Cornwall, where the service is largely privatised, long queues form outside surgeries whenever an NHS practitioner opens up. Even when people do find an NHS dentist - sometimes after travelling miles - the treatment is often second-rate compared to what is available privately. Root canal work and other time-consuming procedures are more likely to fail because of the penny-pinching rules governing NHS fees. Ill-fitting dentures, inferior filling materials and crowns, minimal preventive work, poorly matched veneers - the list goes on. The government is well aware of the shortage of NHS dentists, and the need to raise quality standards. After some delay, it has launched a new strategy, with additional funding attached, to help modernise the sector. The prime minister has pledged that by September next year everybody will be able to get NHS dentistry if and when they need it. So is this just another throwaway promise - like abolishing child poverty - that should not be taken too seriously? Or can it really be done? Junior health minister Lord Hunt, responsible for dentistry, emphasises that the government is putting \u00a3100m into enticing dentists back to the NHS, setting up \"phone and go\" dental access centres for non-registered patients and upgrading the service. But high street dentists say the figures do not stack up. \"The \u00a3100m figure is a myth,\" argues Anthony Kravitz, chief negotiator for general dental practitioners at the British Dental Association (BDA), \"because \u00a360m of it is coming from savings we've already agreed to make. It's not new money at all. And only a small percentage of dentists will gain from the incentive payments. The strategy does nothing to seriously address the shortage of NHS dentists.\" Nor, even assuming dentists can be found to run them, will expanding the number of walk-in centres solve the long-term problem of access to dental care. The British Dental Health Foundation sees it as a worrying move away from regular NHS check-ups and treatment towards quick-fix dental first aid. The reason for the exodus from NHS dentistry comes down largely to a question of money. Ever since the early 90s, when the Conservatives negotiated a new contract for dentists, the real value of the treatment fees paid to them by the NHS has been falling. Typically, a privately practising dentist can get a 50%-60% higher fee rate, so no wonder they are increasingly closing their doors to NHS work. The dental trade fairs are awash with money from this booming private sector, says Kravitz, and all the latest orthodontic treatments and hi-tech gizmos can be had for a price. But under our two-tier system, none of it is available on the NHS. Ian Wylie, incoming chief executive at the BDA, believes the skinflint policy on dental fees reflects the low priority given to oral health generally. \"It got barely a mention in the NHS national plan and dentists have felt increasingly marginalised over the years,\" he says. \"Investment in dentistry has in no way kept pace with the rest of the health service.\" Yet dental health is such a key barometer of overall welfare. Free dental check-ups, along with eye tests, were what everyone rushed to get when the NHS was founded. The state of the nation's teeth has since dramatically improved, but there are still huge social inequalities, and worrying signs - such as 20% fewer people registering with an NHS dentist since 1992 - that things are slipping into reverse. \"Dentists can help detect serious conditions such as oral cancer and arrest long-term problems connected to gum disease,\" says Wylie, who is moving from the King's Fund health policy institute, where he has been director of corporate affairs. \"There is mounting evidence of links between poor oral health and heart disease, premature births,and malnutrition in the elderly. But practitioners need the time to do their job properly; something that, with fee-per-item contracts determining hourly rates, is at a premium within the NHS.\" Interestingly, in dental health settings with different funding arrangements, both patients and practitioners report far higher satisfaction levels. In Ellesmere Port, South Cheshire health authority has been running a \"personal dental service\" - one of a number nationally - that pays dentists according to the number of patients registered, rather than cavities filled. By combining the forces of the local community dental service with all its NHS dentists, it has increased registration by 15%, which is an important achievement in an area with some of the country's worst dental health. \"Plus, now they're off the fee-per-item treatment bandwagon, it has freed up dentists to look seriously at preventive issues, rather than just reaching for the drill,\" says Tony Jenner, South Cheshire's consultant in dental public health. In Cornwall, the local health trust is directly funding a dental access centre to address the severe shortage of NHS treatment. \"The funding system allows dentists to work in a very different way,\" says the service's clin ical director, Peter Nibbs. \"They can offer people more time and have a more rewarding NHS career. Patient surveys have given us embarrassingly universal applause.\" The government's new strategy offers health authorities some scope to commission these types of services locally, but only as add-ons to plug the most obvious access gaps. The present funding regime - the one that prompts a third of newly qualified dentists to say they want to work for private firms - is largely left untouched. The answer, argues the BDA, is to drastically improve NHS dentists' remuneration. Others retort that dentists are just greedy, unethical even: unnecessarily whipping out wisdom teeth and over-prescribing, to bump up their income. \"Of course there's some bad practice,\" says Wylie. \"But the vast majority of the public have a lot of trust in their dentists. We have to show we value their work in the public sector, and allow them to do a good job.\" The alternative - leaving the supply of dental services up to the vagaries of the market - can only reinforce the image of dentists as hustlers who, to coin the old phrase, put metal in your mouth and pull money out of your pocket. The fluoride issue: A five-year-old living in Manchester is three times more likely to suffer tooth decay and to have extractions than one living in Birmingham. The difference seems to be mainly down to fluoride. Manchester's water is non-fluoridated, whereas Birmingham has had fluoride added to its water for almost 40 years. So how fair is that? Not at all, say most dentists, doctors and public health experts. Which is why they have welcomed a major new report from York University which shows significant oral health benefits from fluoridating water, and no \"clear evidence\" of adverse health effects, other than some risk of mottled teeth. Children in fluoridated areas have 15% less tooth decay and there is strong evidence that fluoride - a mineral that strengthens tooth enamel - has benefits for adults too. But only 10% of the country's water supply has fluoride added, in part because of fears about health risks and objections to compulsory mass medication. The real stumbling block to extending fluoridation has been the water companies themselves. Since the industry's privatisation, they have had the final say on whether to add fluoride to water supplies. They have now indicated they will co-operate if the government indemnifies them from any resulting legal action.

      "body": "<p>Does it make sense for the health service to use spare capacity in the private sector? Of course. Only the ideologically obtuse would ignore the under-used capacity in the private sector, where bed occupancy is barely 50%, while NHS facilities are overstretched. This would be true at any time in the year, but is even more relevant now as winter approaches and the pressure on the NHS intensifies. So there is nothing wrong in principle with the \"concordat\" which the health secretary Alan Milburn signed with the private sector yesterday, allowing NHS patients to be transferred to private critical beds. This is no new phenomenon. NHS hospitals have been doing deals with private hospitals for years. Last year \u00a31.25bn of NHS spending on hospital and community health services, almost 5% of the total, was spent with private hospitals. This involved 350,000 operations in an NHS performing 6m. The new deal might add a further 100,000. </p> <p>The health secretary was right to say the problem with the NHS was lack of capacity, not of cash. In the next five years, the NHS will receive its biggest funding increase since it was founded 50 years ago. The aim is to transform the system into a quicker, more responsive, more patient-friendly service. This in turn - particularly the much shorter hospital waiting times - should further reduce demand for private medicine. But not overnight. Hence yesterday's deal. The spare capacity in private hospitals allows local block contracts (say 20 hip replacements by March) to be secured at marginal cost, and that means lower prices. This is good for taxpayers as well as patients. Some deals, where NHS doctors and nurses use the spare private operating theatre, will be even cheaper. </p> <p>There are three caveats. First, the plan does not have a timespan attached. It should have. If the modernised NHS lives up to its ministerial billing, the private sector should become less important. Yet the agreement suggests it will help \"longer term\" planning. Second, it makes no mention of private \"freeloading\" - the fact that all training costs fall on the NHS, and not on private hospitals. This should not be ducked. Third, it fails to clarify what ought to happen when the private sector gets things wrong. At present, uncertainty reigns when because of private hospital failure a patient has to be transferred to an NHS intensive care bed. PPP pays the NHS; Bupa does not. PPP has the right approach.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Does it make sense for the health service to use spare capacity in the private sector? Of course. Only the ideologically obtuse would ignore the under-used capacity in the private sector, where bed occupancy is barely 50%, while NHS facilities are overstretched. This would be true at any time in the year, but is even more relevant now as winter approaches and the pressure on the NHS intensifies. So there is nothing wrong in principle with the \"concordat\" which the health secretary Alan Milburn signed with the private sector yesterday, allowing NHS patients to be transferred to private critical beds. This is no new phenomenon. NHS hospitals have been doing deals with private hospitals for years. Last year \u00a31.25bn of NHS spending on hospital and community health services, almost 5% of the total, was spent with private hospitals. This involved 350,000 operations in an NHS performing 6m. The new deal might add a further 100,000. The health secretary was right to say the problem with the NHS was lack of capacity, not of cash. In the next five years, the NHS will receive its biggest funding increase since it was founded 50 years ago. The aim is to transform the system into a quicker, more responsive, more patient-friendly service. This in turn - particularly the much shorter hospital waiting times - should further reduce demand for private medicine. But not overnight. Hence yesterday's deal. The spare capacity in private hospitals allows local block contracts (say 20 hip replacements by March) to be secured at marginal cost, and that means lower prices. This is good for taxpayers as well as patients. Some deals, where NHS doctors and nurses use the spare private operating theatre, will be even cheaper. There are three caveats. First, the plan does not have a timespan attached. It should have. If the modernised NHS lives up to its ministerial billing, the private sector should become less important. Yet the agreement suggests it will help \"longer term\" planning. Second, it makes no mention of private \"freeloading\" - the fact that all training costs fall on the NHS, and not on private hospitals. This should not be ducked. Third, it fails to clarify what ought to happen when the private sector gets things wrong. At present, uncertainty reigns when because of private hospital failure a patient has to be transferred to an NHS intensive care bed. PPP pays the NHS; Bupa does not. PPP has the right approach.",

Tory ministers conceded most current QMV arrangements to help create the single market in the 1980s.</p> <p>Yesterday Mr Prodi explained: \"It is important that we reinforce the will of the union to support enlargement, preserving our efficiency and having an extension of qualified majority vote... I think this is a fundamental point. Let's put it in very simple terms: it is basically eliminating the right of veto as much as possible - the right of veto is really a manacle chained to Europe.\"</p> <p>Labour ministers routinely say they are prepared to abandon the national veto in favour of QMV on defined areas including environmental, transport and some employment policies. John Redwood protested last night that - unlike most EU states - the Blair government has never set out a formal position on the veto, despite persistent Commons questions.</p> <p>Last night Keith Vaz, minister for Europe, issued a routine denial from the Foreign Office. He said that Mr Prodi and the commission \"are entitled to their view\" but that national governments will decide the issue at Nice - \"treating each issue on their merits\".</p> <p>It was the third time Mr Vaz has been forced to issue a generic denial over Euro scare stories in as many days, as Conservatives and their newspaper allies seized on remarks by Brussels officials as proof that Labour ministers are lying about their federalist intentions.</p> <p>On Sunday the issue was a still-informal scheme for harmonising passport and identity card design in the interests of security. Yesterday a document surfaced on the commission's website suggesting that the \"charter of fundamental rights\" - due to be endorsed at Nice - will acquire eventual legal force.</p> <p>Labour ministers have repeatedly denied that as well. Mr Vaz calls it \"a political declaration of existing rights, it will be non-binding\".</p> <p>The latest row involves the former Italian premier, now head of the commission. Mr Prodi was backed by Mr Blair for the top job in Brussels because of his reformist record and honesty but has since embarrassed Whitehall by his expressions of long-established Italian Euro enthusiasm.</p>",

His remarks suggest the commission wants to apply existing tax agreements reached by John Major and Margaret Thatcher more uniformly, notably over VAT rates, widely different across the EU, and excise duties. Tory ministers conceded most current QMV arrangements to help create the single market in the 1980s. Yesterday Mr Prodi explained: \"It is important that we reinforce the will of the union to support enlargement, preserving our efficiency and having an extension of qualified majority vote... I think this is a fundamental point. Let's put it in very simple terms: it is basically eliminating the right of veto as much as possible - the right of veto is really a manacle chained to Europe.\" Labour ministers routinely say they are prepared to abandon the national veto in favour of QMV on defined areas including environmental, transport and some employment policies. John Redwood protested last night that - unlike most EU states - the Blair government has never set out a formal position on the veto, despite persistent Commons questions. Last night Keith Vaz, minister for Europe, issued a routine denial from the Foreign Office. He said that Mr Prodi and the commission \"are entitled to their view\" but that national governments will decide the issue at Nice - \"treating each issue on their merits\". It was the third time Mr Vaz has been forced to issue a generic denial over Euro scare stories in as many days, as Conservatives and their newspaper allies seized on remarks by Brussels officials as proof that Labour ministers are lying about their federalist intentions. On Sunday the issue was a still-informal scheme for harmonising passport and identity card design in the interests of security. Yesterday a document surfaced on the commission's website suggesting that the \"charter of fundamental rights\" - due to be endorsed at Nice - will acquire eventual legal force. Labour ministers have repeatedly denied that as well. Mr Vaz calls it \"a political declaration of existing rights, it will be non-binding\". The latest row involves the former Italian premier, now head of the commission. Mr Prodi was backed by Mr Blair for the top job in Brussels because of his reformist record and honesty but has since embarrassed Whitehall by his expressions of long-established Italian Euro enthusiasm.",

      "bodyText": "Freud Communications, the agency that famously painted Concorde blue in a PR stunt for Pepsi Cola, has lost the UK consumer account for Pepsi after seven years. The multi-million pound business has moved to rival PR agency Ketchum Life, which has picked up the entire UK consumer PR account for all Britvic's carbonated drinks. Britvic markets some of the UK's best-known soft drinks brands, including Tango and R Whites lemonade as well as Pepsi. Freud's will continue to work on Pepsi until the end of the year. After that it will retain the international consumer PR account for Pepsi and will continue to handle the corporate PR for Pepsi Cola UK. Oliver Wheeler, a director of Freud Communications, said: \"It is unfortunate that we will no longer be working with Britvic as an extension of our global Pepsi portfolio.\" The account will be headed at Ketchum Life by deputy managing director Jenny Swift. She said: \"This is a fantastic win for us. It plays entirely to our strengths.\" Tango was previously handled by PR agency Henry's House, which also pitched for the consolidated account. Ian Armstrong, senior brand manager on Tango who co-ordinated the pitch, said: \"All the shortlisted agencies put up a strong performance but we were particularly impressed by Ketchum Life's strong grasp of their brief, their understanding of the strategies required and knowledge of the key influencers to deliver the object.\" Freud's had been expected to lose the UK consumer account because of its work for Pepsico, the US owner of Pepsi. The blue Concorde stunt was part of an international rebranding drive that saw Pepsi cans change from red to blue to distinguish them from arch-rival Coca-Cola. Freud's also orchestrated a tie-in with the Mirror, which changed its pages from white to blue for a day. Britvic, which distributes Pepsi in the UK, is widely expected to come up for sale in the near future with Pepsico the most likely buyer. This would create a conflict of interest if Freud were also working for Britvic.",

This could settle a long-standing and increasingly boring argument... do your best!\"</p> <p>You're right, William. Contrary to popular belief, Giggsy never had the option of playing for England. He was born in Cardiff to Welsh parents, and only moved to the Manchester area when he was seven.</p> <p>He did captain England schoolboys when he played at that level for Manchester United, but as Mark Wylie of the Manchester United museum explains: \"That was due to residence.

The first game was a Group D match played on June 8 1958 in Gothenburg. Despite going 2-0 down after 56 minutes, goals from West Brom's Derek Kevan and Preston's Tom Finney earned them a 2-2 draw.</p> <p>The England side for that match was: McDonald - Howe, Banks, Clamp - Wright (c), Slater - Douglas, Robson, Kevan, Haynes, Finney.</p> <p>However, after the sides finished second in the group with three points, they were forced to play off on June 18. Unfortunately, England - with Finney unfit and Bobby Charlton unused in the stands - could not breach the Soviet defence this time. Although Chelsea winger Peter Brabrook had a goal disallowed for handball, the Russians held firm and eventually won 1-0 when their left-winger Ilyin scored on 68 minutes.</p> <p>The England team for that match was: McDonald - Howe, Banks, Clayton - Wright (c), Slater - Brabrook, Broadbent, Kevan, Haynes, A'Court.</p> <p><strong>WHY ARE EXETER CALLED THE GRECIANS?</strong></p> <p>\"Why are Exeter City nicknamed The Grecians?\" asks Philip Mawdsley. \"I know that the city was once home to a legion of Roman soldiers but that doesn't really explain how the football club picked up its peculiar nickname. Even native Exonians I've asked don't seem to know.\"</p> <p>The answer - according to Hazel Harvey's book Exeter Past - stems from a fair on Southernhay in July 1726, in which the Siege of Troy was enacted. Apparently the inhabitants of St Sidwell's (outside the city walls) identified themselves with the attacking Greeks, or Grecians.</p> <p>Less than a decade later, football matches between the city dwellers (who called themselves the Blues) and \"the rugged inhabitants of St Sidwell's\" were commonplace. Soon \"Greeks\" had given way to \"Grecians\" and by the mid-1800s the term instantly identified a resident from St Sidwell's. </p> <p>So perhaps it's not surprising that the football ground just off the end of Sidwell Street acquired a \"Grecian Gate\". And when the team that played there, St Sidwell's Old Boys, changed its name to Exeter City, they were given the nickname \"Grecians\".</p> <p><strong>SHILTS FROM THE SPOT</strong></p> <p>\"Against which player did Peter Shilton make his only penalty save for England? It's got me stumped,\" admits Carl Hollingworth.</p> <p>Shilton's only penalty success in an England shirt came when he saved a spot-kick from Andreas Brehme of West Germany in a 1985 3-0 victory in Mexico City.</p> <p>Sadly, Brehme had the last laugh, pelting one past the spring-haired custodian in some match or other in Turin five years later. And a few days after that, Brehme became the first man to settle a World Cup final from the spot.

Her first appearance in the BBC1 schedules was a sensational hit, pulling in 7.8m viewers. It was almost enough to beat ITV in the ratings and clinches Ms Robinson's position as one of the few hosts who could provide a real challenge to ITV's Who Wants to be a Millionaire?. The quiz show has been winning audiences of more than 4m on BBC2 but made its debut on BBC1 last night as part of the new-look schedule. It opened with a 32% share over 40 minutes from 8pm, according to unofficial overnights. ITV's long-running police drama, The Bill, which was scheduled against the Weakest Link, was only narrowly ahead with an average audience of 8.2m and a 33% share between 8pm-9pm. BBC1 boss Lorraine Heggessey will be thrilled with the performance of The Weakest Link, which has virtually wiped out the 3.5m-viewer gap that previously existed with ITV. Last week in the same BBC1 slot, sitcom My Family attracted just 6m, while The Bill averaged 9.5m. The Weakest Link's debut is thought to be the best by a BBC1 quiz show for five years. The programme enjoyed a strong inheritance from EastEnders, with the build-up to Frank Butcher's departure from Albert Square drawing a massive 13.2m and 57% share from 7.30pm. A second instalment of EastEnders from 8.40pm drew 9.8m. But despite this hefty leg-up, the second outing for BBC1 Pete Postlethwaite drama The Sins, following on at 9.10pm, dropped from last week's 6.6m to 6.1m. Elsewhere last night, Channel 4 documentary repeat The Real Prince Philip held up well, averaging 2.5m and a 12% share over nearly two hours from 9pm.

Beijing's liaison office in Hong Kong says it \"strongly condemns\" the incident in which a small group of protesters burnt a newspaper cutting outside the local office of the Chinese foreign ministry. Pro-Beijing newspapers in Hong Kong have demanded that the protesters face criminal prosecution although no law appears to have been broken. Mr Jiang lost his temper completely last Friday when asked about official Chinese support for Hong Kong's chief executive, Tung Chee-hwa, serving for a second term. \"I'm angry,\" he shouted at a group of Hong Kong reporters, accusing them of being \"too simple [and] sometimes naive\". \"I am not a journalist,\" he continued, \"but I have seen a lot. I need to teach you a lesson about life.\" Mr Jiang was stung by a question suggesting that his endorsement of Mr Tung amounted to an \"imperial instruction\". Twice he moved to rejoin Mr Tung but then spun on his heels and advanced on the reporters again, jabbing his finger in the air. \"Let me tell you,\" he shouted, \"I've lived through many battles. I've seen it all. I've been to every country in the west!\" The outburst has given Jiang-watchers fresh insight into the often tetchy character of the supreme leader of a nation of 1.3bn people. Infuriated by demonstrators last year on a state visit to Switzerland, Mr Jiang boycotted the official welcoming ceremony and told the Swiss president, Ruth Dreifuss, that \"you have lost a friend\". Mr Jiang, writes his biographer Willy Lam, is obsessed with appearances and likes to project an image of self-confidence.

His father, the owner of a paint company, and his mother, an artist, were keen for their son to study painting. Thus, from the age of 10, he attended the Chicago Art Institute. After moving to Los Angeles, he continued his studies at Chouinard Art Institute, which eventually became the California Institute of Arts, or Cal Arts, producing many of Hollywood's finest animators.</p> <p>In 1938, Hurtz got a job assisting Art Babbitt, one of the chief animators at Walt Disney Studios. One day, while cleaning up Babbitt's drawings of dancing Chinese mushrooms, from the Nutcracker Suite sequence of Fantasia (1940), Babbitt asked him how much he was earning. \"When he heard it was $25 a week, he got mad, went up to Walt's office and got me a $10-a-week raise,\" Hurtz recalled. \"I think the lack of a regular wage scale was one of the main reasons for the strike.\"</p> <p>The strike, on May 29 1941, was proposed by Hurtz, an active member of the Hollywood Cartoonists Union, after Babbitt was sacked for being critical of the inequalities, and for attempting to get Disney to allow his animators to join a union. The conflict lasted for several months, but its positive result helped raise the status and wages of animators in Hollywood.</p> <p>Hurtz, who was labelled a \"dangerous red\" and dismissed by Disney, became part of the film motion picture unit of the US Army Signal Corps during the second world war, making animated training films at Hal Roach Studios. After being demobbed, he joined other former Disney animators - such as John Hubley, Bob Cannon and Steve Bosustow - who had formed United Productions of America, better known as UPA.</p> <p>Hurtz had learned, while working on wartime instructional films, that complicated concepts could be expressed in line and colour with extreme economy. Reacting against the detail of the Disney style, UPA created spare, elegant, highly stylised and more contemporary drawings.</p> <p>The group established itself as a new creative force in short cartoons with the 1951 Oscar-winner Robert Cannon's Gerald McBoing Boing, on which Hurtz was the layout artist. The company's democratic structure allowed its members to explore their individual styles, and Hurtz was able to direct A Unicorn In The Garden (1953), based on a story by James Thurber.</p> <p>In an effort to duplicate the unfinished look of Thurber's New Yorker cartoons, Hurtz assigned some work to the studio's least competent draftsmen - to get the \"nice, lumpy look\" he was after. He also worked on some Mr Magoo cartoons, UPA's most successful productions.</p> <p>With the decline of UPA in the late 1950s, Hurtz left to work independently, most notably as director of several celebrated title sequences, designed by Saul Bass, for such films as Around the World In 80 Days (1956), Anatomy Of A Murder (1959) and Psycho (1960). The graphic motifs of the lastwere nervous, balletic horizontal and vertical bars that expanded and contracted in mirror-image patterns, suggesting, simultaneously, prison bars, city buildings and sound waves, as well as symbolising the schizophrenia of the main character, Norman Bates.</p> <p>In 1959, Hurtz joined Jay Ward Productions, a newly-formed television animation studio, to supervise Rocky And His Friends, the popular comic series featuring a flying squirrel. This was followed by The Adventures Of Hoppity Hooper (1964) and George Of The Jungle (1967).

Ms Howell is hoping the cherry acronym - \"contemporary hardworking exiles from the rock and rave years\" - will stick as a new way of describing people in their late thirties and beyond.",

Charlton are set to sign Jamaican striker Ricardo Fuller for \u00a31m. Bolton are interested in taking loan striker Isaiah Rankin off Bradford's hands - but not at the Yorkshire club's \u00a31.5m asking price. Huddersfield will announce the appointment of Lou Macari as their new manager this morning, according to Teamtalk. Joe Jordan will be his number two, with John Deehan staying on as coach. Tony Cottee, who left Norwich yesterday by mutual consent, is expected to be named manager of Barnet later today.",

      "byline": "David Teather,  media business correspondent",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Bertelsmann, one of the top five music publishing businesses in the world, yesterday broke ranks with its rivals and agreed to drop its copyright lawsuit against Napster, the rogue online music distributor. </p> <p>The agreement appeared to be a tacit acknowledgement by Bertelsmann that the landslide change being wrought on music sales by the internet cannot be stopped. It also marks a significant stage in the development of online music distribution toward a more controlled environment endorsed by the recording industry. </p> <p>Bertelsmann said it had formed a strategic alliance with Napster to develop the website into a secure, membership-based service and invited the other big four to participate. The lawsuit will be dropped once the membership-based service is put in place. </p> <p>The music business has so far struggled to find a method of protecting royalty payments online. </p> <p>The two companies said they had already put together a business model and that Bertelsmann would provide funds to further develop the service. In return for the funding Germany-based Bertelsmann will take a stake in Napster. </p> <p>Napster is the brainchild of 19-year-old college dropout Shawn Fanning and enables fans to swap songs for free by trading MP3 files, a compression technology which turns music on compact disc into computer files. </p> <p>One by one, the large record labels have reached licencing agreements with MP3.com - a similar smaller website. But Napster which has attracted 38m users has until now been cast as the enemy of the music business. Mr Fanning said he was excited that Bertelsmann \"appreciates and values the uniqueness of the community Napsters' users have built\". </p> <p>Napster is awaiting an appeals court decision on whether the online service can continue operating pending a final decision on the lawsuit. The suit was also being brought by Universal Music - currently being taken over by Vivendi - Sony Music, Warner Music and EMI. </p> <p>Bertelsmann chairman Thomas Middelhoff said: \"Napster has pointed the way for a new direction for music distribution, and we believe it will form the basis of important and exciting new business models for the future of the music industry.\" </p> <p>Time Warner, which owns Warner Music, gave an initial welcome to the decision by Bertelsmann.

      "bodyText": "Bertelsmann, one of the top five music publishing businesses in the world, yesterday broke ranks with its rivals and agreed to drop its copyright lawsuit against Napster, the rogue online music distributor. The agreement appeared to be a tacit acknowledgement by Bertelsmann that the landslide change being wrought on music sales by the internet cannot be stopped. It also marks a significant stage in the development of online music distribution toward a more controlled environment endorsed by the recording industry. Bertelsmann said it had formed a strategic alliance with Napster to develop the website into a secure, membership-based service and invited the other big four to participate. The lawsuit will be dropped once the membership-based service is put in place. The music business has so far struggled to find a method of protecting royalty payments online. The two companies said they had already put together a business model and that Bertelsmann would provide funds to further develop the service. In return for the funding Germany-based Bertelsmann will take a stake in Napster. Napster is the brainchild of 19-year-old college dropout Shawn Fanning and enables fans to swap songs for free by trading MP3 files, a compression technology which turns music on compact disc into computer files. One by one, the large record labels have reached licencing agreements with MP3.com - a similar smaller website. But Napster which has attracted 38m users has until now been cast as the enemy of the music business. Mr Fanning said he was excited that Bertelsmann \"appreciates and values the uniqueness of the community Napsters' users have built\". Napster is awaiting an appeals court decision on whether the online service can continue operating pending a final decision on the lawsuit. The suit was also being brought by Universal Music - currently being taken over by Vivendi - Sony Music, Warner Music and EMI. Bertelsmann chairman Thomas Middelhoff said: \"Napster has pointed the way for a new direction for music distribution, and we believe it will form the basis of important and exciting new business models for the future of the music industry.\" Time Warner, which owns Warner Music, gave an initial welcome to the decision by Bertelsmann. It said: \"The Napster-BMG announcement seems to be a positive step for the industry. It demonstrates a couple of things very clearly. One, that the industry is rapidly moving towards adoption of a subscription model and two, in the online world, artists and intellectual property rights will be protected. It is clear consumers want access to music in a way that is safe, secure and easy to use.\" In July, a US judge ordered Napster to shut down its services pending a full trial but the court of appeals allowed Napster to stay in business.

      "bodyText": "Civilian Content, the British film and TV company, yesterday announced it had secured lottery funding of \u00a320m over the next three years, as it reported its interim results. The AIM-listed company, headed by Richard Thompson, who with his father is said to have amassed a combined fortune of \u00a3340m, wants to become a major producer with a broad audience appeal. Confirmation of lottery funding for Civilian Content's subsidiary, the Film Consortium, came after a successful review by the Film Council. The company has already had three years of funding, but it looked as if it would lose the lottery backing in August because of commercial failures. The company has since been sold to Civilian Content, a move welcomed by the Film Council. Richard Holmes, Civilian Content's managing director, said: \"With the lottery funding confirmed and an exciting pipeline of film and television product coming to market over the next few months we are well placed to achieve our stated ambition of becoming major producers of content with broad audience appeal and potential for UK and international exploitation.\" Civilian reported a first-half pretax loss of \u00a3687,000 for the six months to 30 June this year from a profit of \u00a33m for the same period last year. Turnover was \u00a31.6m, up from \u00a30.6m for the previous year.",

      "body": "<p>The American presidential election and the Danish referendum on the single currency may not seem to have much in common, but together they are posing some historic choices for Britain. Whether it is Al Gore or George W Bush who wins next week, America looks set to loosen its ties with Europe. At the same time, partly as a result of Denmark's devastating referendum, Europe is fractured and directionless as never before.</p> <p>For decades Britain has positioned itself as a mediator between Europe and America. The risk today is that it will be left stranded between them. The United States is the world's only truly global power, its hegemony more complete than any in modern history. America's military and technological might is such that no state can come anywhere close to challenging it in the foreseeable future. Yet it is possessed by insecurity. After a decade of sustained interventionism, the world has not been made over in America's image. The conflicts of the Balkans and the Middle East have proved resistant to American power and idealism. The American public is discovering that the post-cold war world is a dangerous and intractable place.</p> <p>Hence its fascination with national missile defence (NMD), the scheme for a hi-tech shield against attack by rogue states. Across the whole spectrum of foreign and defence policy, America is tilting towards unilateral action in defence of its national interest. As Hugo Young has noted, George Bush's chief foreign policy advisor, Condoleeza Rice, has called for the withdrawal of American forces from Kosovo and Bosnia - seemingly ignorant of the fact that more than 80% of the peacekeeping forces are provided by European countries.</p> <p>Baffled by the intractability of the world, and angered by its stubborn resistance to American values, a substantial section of American opinion is turning inwards. Utopian rhetoric about worldwide democratic capitalism is being replaced by the more pragmatic project of globalisation in one country. The internationalist perspective that framed American foreign relations from the second world war right through the Clinton era is being steadily superseded by a single-minded focus on America's strategic interests. This tilt to unilateralism may be accentuated if Dubya Bush wins the White House, but it will not be altered if Al Gore takes the crown. In future, as in the past, America's relations with the rest of the world are likely to be shaped by the imperatives of trade, oil and old- fashioned geopolitics.</p> <p>America's turn to realpolitik need not be all bad. The world may be reverting to an international system more like that of the 19th than the 20th century, in which wars were fought over interests, not ideologies. A more introverted and self- regarding America is not without risks, but American policies are better shaped by the limited imperatives of national interest than by the unending demands of ideology. Even so, this shift in American thinking is taking place at an awkward time.</p> <p>The Danish referendum has shattered forever any prospect of the European Union coming together as a whole to form a federal state. There can be no more talk of a multi-speed Europe - a metaphor which suggests that all EU members are travelling to the same destination. The EU is already multidirectional. France and Germany may be bent on closer union, but it is clear that several member states will not follow them - above all Britain. There is now no way a referendum on Britain joining the euro can be held and won in Labour's second term - and if not then, when? In truth, there is now little prospect of Britain ever joining the euro.</p> <p>It is not only that the hostility of British voters to the euro has rarely been more pronounced. More, the euro's continuing weakness is revealing deep-seated flaws in the European project. Can anyone be sure that, sometime over the next 10 or 20 years, opposition to the single currency will not grow in influence in France and Germany? How can anyone be sure the euro will still exist 20 years from now?</p> <p>British voters' increasingly immovable hostility to the idea of deeper integration with the EU cannot be explained chiefly by the Blair government's timorous refusal to engage the issue. It is a reasonable response to the demonstrated failings of European institutions.</p> <p>Outside the wilder fringes of the Tory party, few people seriously entertain the idea of Britain leaving the EU. Equally, however, there are few who can now be persuaded that it is in Britain's interest to opt for deeper integration.</p> <p>Yet the halfway house, between the US and Europe, may soon cease to be viable. With France and Germany coming together in an experiment in top-down, post- democratic federalism and the US withdrawing from Europe in order to defend its national interests unilaterally, the risk for Britain is that it may be left in a no man's land. A choice is shaping up for Britain for which voters and the political classes seem wholly unprepared.</p> <p>John Gray is professor of European thought at the LSE.

      "bodyText": "The American presidential election and the Danish referendum on the single currency may not seem to have much in common, but together they are posing some historic choices for Britain. Whether it is Al Gore or George W Bush who wins next week, America looks set to loosen its ties with Europe. At the same time, partly as a result of Denmark's devastating referendum, Europe is fractured and directionless as never before. For decades Britain has positioned itself as a mediator between Europe and America. The risk today is that it will be left stranded between them. The United States is the world's only truly global power, its hegemony more complete than any in modern history. America's military and technological might is such that no state can come anywhere close to challenging it in the foreseeable future. Yet it is possessed by insecurity. After a decade of sustained interventionism, the world has not been made over in America's image. The conflicts of the Balkans and the Middle East have proved resistant to American power and idealism. The American public is discovering that the post-cold war world is a dangerous and intractable place. Hence its fascination with national missile defence (NMD), the scheme for a hi-tech shield against attack by rogue states. Across the whole spectrum of foreign and defence policy, America is tilting towards unilateral action in defence of its national interest. As Hugo Young has noted, George Bush's chief foreign policy advisor, Condoleeza Rice, has called for the withdrawal of American forces from Kosovo and Bosnia - seemingly ignorant of the fact that more than 80% of the peacekeeping forces are provided by European countries. Baffled by the intractability of the world, and angered by its stubborn resistance to American values, a substantial section of American opinion is turning inwards. Utopian rhetoric about worldwide democratic capitalism is being replaced by the more pragmatic project of globalisation in one country. The internationalist perspective that framed American foreign relations from the second world war right through the Clinton era is being steadily superseded by a single-minded focus on America's strategic interests. This tilt to unilateralism may be accentuated if Dubya Bush wins the White House, but it will not be altered if Al Gore takes the crown. In future, as in the past, America's relations with the rest of the world are likely to be shaped by the imperatives of trade, oil and old- fashioned geopolitics. America's turn to realpolitik need not be all bad. The world may be reverting to an international system more like that of the 19th than the 20th century, in which wars were fought over interests, not ideologies. A more introverted and self- regarding America is not without risks, but American policies are better shaped by the limited imperatives of national interest than by the unending demands of ideology. Even so, this shift in American thinking is taking place at an awkward time. The Danish referendum has shattered forever any prospect of the European Union coming together as a whole to form a federal state. There can be no more talk of a multi-speed Europe - a metaphor which suggests that all EU members are travelling to the same destination. The EU is already multidirectional. France and Germany may be bent on closer union, but it is clear that several member states will not follow them - above all Britain. There is now no way a referendum on Britain joining the euro can be held and won in Labour's second term - and if not then, when? In truth, there is now little prospect of Britain ever joining the euro. It is not only that the hostility of British voters to the euro has rarely been more pronounced. More, the euro's continuing weakness is revealing deep-seated flaws in the European project. Can anyone be sure that, sometime over the next 10 or 20 years, opposition to the single currency will not grow in influence in France and Germany? How can anyone be sure the euro will still exist 20 years from now? British voters' increasingly immovable hostility to the idea of deeper integration with the EU cannot be explained chiefly by the Blair government's timorous refusal to engage the issue. It is a reasonable response to the demonstrated failings of European institutions. Outside the wilder fringes of the Tory party, few people seriously entertain the idea of Britain leaving the EU. Equally, however, there are few who can now be persuaded that it is in Britain's interest to opt for deeper integration. Yet the halfway house, between the US and Europe, may soon cease to be viable. With France and Germany coming together in an experiment in top-down, post- democratic federalism and the US withdrawing from Europe in order to defend its national interests unilaterally, the risk for Britain is that it may be left in a no man's land. A choice is shaping up for Britain for which voters and the political classes seem wholly unprepared. John Gray is professor of European thought at the LSE.

Mr Ivanov, secretary of Russia's security council and a close and influential adviser to President Putin, met Peter Ricketts, chairman of Whitehall's joint intelligence committee, and other officials. It is believed to be the first meeting between such senior security officials from Britain and Russia. At a press conference Mr Ivanov made it clear that terrorism featured prominently on the agenda. He referred repeatedly to Chechnya and the Taliban regime in Afghanistan and to what he called \"pseudo-religious organisations [masquerading] under the guise of the Muslim religion\". He raised the activities of the Halo Trust mine clearing charity whose members Moscow accused earlier this year of subversive actions in Chechnya. Mr Ivanov, who also met Tony Blair, said the British government shared Moscow's views on what he called \"the horrible evil\" of terrorism and the need to counter money-laundering. He added that Russia had learned from \"the UK's positive experiences in Northern Ireland\". He also raised American plans for a national missile defence system, a project which will mean amending or scrapping the anti-ballistic missile (ABM) treaty signed by the US and the then Soviet Union in 1972.",

      "body": "<p>\"Don't judge my heart,\" George W Bush scolded Al Gore when the vice president questioned his record as Texas governor. Mr Gore retreated, insisting he meant to do nothing so personal. But Lydia Camarillo would not have held back. For her, it is personal.</p> <p>Mrs Camarillo is in an unusually good position to judge the quality of Governor Bush's compassion. She lives in the colonias, the Hispanic shanty towns clustered in the Rio Grande Valley. It is the poorest corner of the nation, from where the warm, fuzzy campaign talk about the governor's much-vaunted heart and his concern to \"leave no child behind\" seems, at best, surreal.</p> <p>Viewed from here, Texas is a harsh state of extreme inequality, which has become more unequal under Mr Bush's leadership. In a time of booming economy and record budget surpluses, the governor's corporate allies have made a killing at the lucrative intersection of state government and business. Meanwhile 45% of the population in the lower Rio Grande Valley live below the poverty line and pray that they never need medical help they cannot afford. It is an unforgiving place, unrecognisable from the progressive and tolerant state evoked in Mr Bush's stump speeches.</p> <p>The governor's powers are strictly circumscribed by the state constitution, but with less than a week potentially separating Mr Bush from the White House, his priorities and policies as Texas governor give clear indications about how he might lead America.</p> <p>Mrs Camarillo views him as a negligent, absentee landlord. She points out that he has never even been to a \"colonia\" with its mostly Mexican-American population. In his five years as governor, Mr Bush has been to the border region only a handful of times, for \"photo-opportunities\". But unlike all his recent predecessors, he has never strayed into the huddled grids of dirt roads and shacks, so he cannot have smelt the dizzying odour of a thousand pit latrines and septic tanks when the rain begins to fall.</p> <p>\"When it floods it brings up all that stuff,\" Mrs Camarillo said. \"It rises up and gets into people's houses.\"</p> <p>When her son, Robert, fell ill with bronchitis she hesitated before taking him to see a doctor because she had no health insurance. When his condition became serious, she panicked and rushed him across the Rio Grande, to the Mexican border town of Reynosa. \"The doctor there said if I had been just a few hours later, he would have been dead.\"</p> <p>Lydia Camarillo's plight is not unusual. There are 1.4m uninsured children in Texas, a higher proportion than anywhere else in the country, be cause Texas, under Mr Bush's governorship, makes it harder than any other state to get affordable healthcare. Lydia and her husband, Belarmino, have no steady jobs. She bakes cakes and sells them from home, and the family migrates northwards in the summer to work as agricultural labourers.</p> <p>But the Camarillos' most prized possession, a pick-up truck, is valued at over $2,000 (about \u00a31,380), which is enough to disqualify them from Medicaid, the government funded free healthcare scheme. They are considered too \"wealthy\".</p> <p>This was an issue to which the governor gave unusually detailed attention. His administration blocked the adoption of a national child health insurance programme (Chip), which offers affordable care to families just above the absolute poverty level. Although the scheme is funded entirely by the federal government, Mr Bush argued that 20% of the applicants \"will come in seeking Chip but will be enrolled in Medicaid instead\", and that would have to be paid out of his state budget. In plain English, he was afraid poor Texan families would find out what free medical care they were entitled to. His administration fought an attempt to put it on the state legislative agenda in 1997. Instead, he spent much of the state's $6.4bn on tax-cuts, including a $1bn cut in property taxes. Under increasing duress last year, he suggested a more limited scheme which would have excluded 200,000 children, before giving in to political pressure.</p> <p>\"On Chip, he was no good at all. He had to be dragged into it kicking and screaming,\" said Ernesto Cortes, a leader of the local community action group, Valley Interfaith.</p> <p>In his standard presidential campaign appearances, Mr Bush now claims credit for the Chip scheme, which has evolved into an essential element of his bipartisan \"compassionate conservative\" image.</p> <p>It is spin of Orwellian boldness. It is still tougher in Texas than in almost any other state to gain access to Medicaid. And in a region where the per capita income is $7,700, less than half the Texas average, the Bush administration in 1997 actually attempted in 1997 to lower the minimum wage of $3.25 an hour.</p> <p>Mr Bush's governorship has overseen a steady deregulation of business, at the expense - his critics argue - of the individual. Nowhere is this clearer than in tort reform, the central plank in Mr Bush's election campaigns in 1994 and today.</p> <p>Crudely put, the law limits the ability of courts to inflict punitive damages on negligent businesses. It would, Mr Bush promised, curb the spread of \"junk lawsuits\" by avaricious lawyers aimed at extorting money out of innocent firms.</p> <p>But tort reform also affected people like Donna Hall, whose husband Charles was killed in 1996 in an explosion at a refinery in Amarillo, at the opposite end of Texas. He had repeatedly complained about the state of the valves, but the management had neglected to carry out maintenance work. A jury imposed $42.5m in punitive damages on the refinery, Ultramar Diamond Shamrock, but under the tort reform laws, a judge unilaterally reduced the award to $200,000, barely enough to cover the cost of taking the firm to court.</p> <p>Once again, where there were losers, there were also winners - in this case the company. The legislation also restricted claims on Texas insurance companies, who, according to the Centre for Economic Justice in Austin, made $3bn in windfall profits as a result. The insurance industry has subsequently been a significant contributor to the Bush presidential campaign.</p> <p><b> Most polluted</b><br></p> <p>On the other end of the winner-loser scale are JR and Lupe Cordova. The couple live in Houston, which last year overtook Los Angeles as the most polluted city in the nation. As a focal point of the petro-chemical industry, it has always been a dirty town, but from where the Cordovas stand, it has got a loss worse.</p> <p>Perched on the Houston Ship Channel, their neighbourhood, which goes by the ironic name of Woodland Acres, has been suffocated by the seemingly unregulated industrial sprawl around them. A steel firm called North Shore Supply Company built a galvanising plant across the road from them, despite zoning regulations defining the street as residential. Despite the family's complaints, those regulations have never been enforced, and the plant continues to add to the burden of chemicals and black dust in the air. By their own accounting, Houston industries pump nearly a million tonnes of pollutants into the air each year in \"accidental\" chemical releases. The condition of the air alone is estimated to cause nearly 1,000 deaths in Houston a year.</p> <p>The Cordovas' son Stephen, 10, has chronic bronchitis and, like his father, a near-permanent rash which turns the skin on his arm red and tough. At elementary school, he would vomit after every meal. Their daughter Jessica, 15, had such severe asthma that she was unable to go outside for more than 20 minutes at a time. \"My daughter tells her version of our life together. It's all seen from inside looking through the window at us outside,\" Mrs Cordova said.</p> <p>Mr Cordova developed severe sinus and respiratory problems and had to leave his job as a docker on the channel, but he still wanted to stay in the blighted neighbourhood he had grown up in. But, the Cordovas were forced out of Woodland Acres anyway.</p> <p>After Mrs Cordova, a schoolteacher, became prominent in a campaign by local mothers to force national environmental standards on the local industries, the couple began receiving death threats.

      "bodyText": "\"Don't judge my heart,\" George W Bush scolded Al Gore when the vice president questioned his record as Texas governor. Mr Gore retreated, insisting he meant to do nothing so personal. But Lydia Camarillo would not have held back. For her, it is personal. Mrs Camarillo is in an unusually good position to judge the quality of Governor Bush's compassion. She lives in the colonias, the Hispanic shanty towns clustered in the Rio Grande Valley. It is the poorest corner of the nation, from where the warm, fuzzy campaign talk about the governor's much-vaunted heart and his concern to \"leave no child behind\" seems, at best, surreal. Viewed from here, Texas is a harsh state of extreme inequality, which has become more unequal under Mr Bush's leadership. In a time of booming economy and record budget surpluses, the governor's corporate allies have made a killing at the lucrative intersection of state government and business. Meanwhile 45% of the population in the lower Rio Grande Valley live below the poverty line and pray that they never need medical help they cannot afford. It is an unforgiving place, unrecognisable from the progressive and tolerant state evoked in Mr Bush's stump speeches. The governor's powers are strictly circumscribed by the state constitution, but with less than a week potentially separating Mr Bush from the White House, his priorities and policies as Texas governor give clear indications about how he might lead America. Mrs Camarillo views him as a negligent, absentee landlord. She points out that he has never even been to a \"colonia\" with its mostly Mexican-American population. In his five years as governor, Mr Bush has been to the border region only a handful of times, for \"photo-opportunities\". But unlike all his recent predecessors, he has never strayed into the huddled grids of dirt roads and shacks, so he cannot have smelt the dizzying odour of a thousand pit latrines and septic tanks when the rain begins to fall. \"When it floods it brings up all that stuff,\" Mrs Camarillo said. \"It rises up and gets into people's houses.\" When her son, Robert, fell ill with bronchitis she hesitated before taking him to see a doctor because she had no health insurance. When his condition became serious, she panicked and rushed him across the Rio Grande, to the Mexican border town of Reynosa. \"The doctor there said if I had been just a few hours later, he would have been dead.\" Lydia Camarillo's plight is not unusual. There are 1.4m uninsured children in Texas, a higher proportion than anywhere else in the country, be cause Texas, under Mr Bush's governorship, makes it harder than any other state to get affordable healthcare. Lydia and her husband, Belarmino, have no steady jobs. She bakes cakes and sells them from home, and the family migrates northwards in the summer to work as agricultural labourers. But the Camarillos' most prized possession, a pick-up truck, is valued at over $2,000 (about \u00a31,380), which is enough to disqualify them from Medicaid, the government funded free healthcare scheme. They are considered too \"wealthy\". This was an issue to which the governor gave unusually detailed attention. His administration blocked the adoption of a national child health insurance programme (Chip), which offers affordable care to families just above the absolute poverty level. Although the scheme is funded entirely by the federal government, Mr Bush argued that 20% of the applicants \"will come in seeking Chip but will be enrolled in Medicaid instead\", and that would have to be paid out of his state budget. In plain English, he was afraid poor Texan families would find out what free medical care they were entitled to. His administration fought an attempt to put it on the state legislative agenda in 1997. Instead, he spent much of the state's $6.4bn on tax-cuts, including a $1bn cut in property taxes. Under increasing duress last year, he suggested a more limited scheme which would have excluded 200,000 children, before giving in to political pressure. \"On Chip, he was no good at all. He had to be dragged into it kicking and screaming,\" said Ernesto Cortes, a leader of the local community action group, Valley Interfaith. In his standard presidential campaign appearances, Mr Bush now claims credit for the Chip scheme, which has evolved into an essential element of his bipartisan \"compassionate conservative\" image. It is spin of Orwellian boldness. It is still tougher in Texas than in almost any other state to gain access to Medicaid. And in a region where the per capita income is $7,700, less than half the Texas average, the Bush administration in 1997 actually attempted in 1997 to lower the minimum wage of $3.25 an hour. Mr Bush's governorship has overseen a steady deregulation of business, at the expense - his critics argue - of the individual. Nowhere is this clearer than in tort reform, the central plank in Mr Bush's election campaigns in 1994 and today. Crudely put, the law limits the ability of courts to inflict punitive damages on negligent businesses. It would, Mr Bush promised, curb the spread of \"junk lawsuits\" by avaricious lawyers aimed at extorting money out of innocent firms. But tort reform also affected people like Donna Hall, whose husband Charles was killed in 1996 in an explosion at a refinery in Amarillo, at the opposite end of Texas. He had repeatedly complained about the state of the valves, but the management had neglected to carry out maintenance work. A jury imposed $42.5m in punitive damages on the refinery, Ultramar Diamond Shamrock, but under the tort reform laws, a judge unilaterally reduced the award to $200,000, barely enough to cover the cost of taking the firm to court. Once again, where there were losers, there were also winners - in this case the company. The legislation also restricted claims on Texas insurance companies, who, according to the Centre for Economic Justice in Austin, made $3bn in windfall profits as a result. The insurance industry has subsequently been a significant contributor to the Bush presidential campaign. Most polluted On the other end of the winner-loser scale are JR and Lupe Cordova. The couple live in Houston, which last year overtook Los Angeles as the most polluted city in the nation. As a focal point of the petro-chemical industry, it has always been a dirty town, but from where the Cordovas stand, it has got a loss worse. Perched on the Houston Ship Channel, their neighbourhood, which goes by the ironic name of Woodland Acres, has been suffocated by the seemingly unregulated industrial sprawl around them. A steel firm called North Shore Supply Company built a galvanising plant across the road from them, despite zoning regulations defining the street as residential. Despite the family's complaints, those regulations have never been enforced, and the plant continues to add to the burden of chemicals and black dust in the air. By their own accounting, Houston industries pump nearly a million tonnes of pollutants into the air each year in \"accidental\" chemical releases. The condition of the air alone is estimated to cause nearly 1,000 deaths in Houston a year. The Cordovas' son Stephen, 10, has chronic bronchitis and, like his father, a near-permanent rash which turns the skin on his arm red and tough. At elementary school, he would vomit after every meal. Their daughter Jessica, 15, had such severe asthma that she was unable to go outside for more than 20 minutes at a time. \"My daughter tells her version of our life together. It's all seen from inside looking through the window at us outside,\" Mrs Cordova said. Mr Cordova developed severe sinus and respiratory problems and had to leave his job as a docker on the channel, but he still wanted to stay in the blighted neighbourhood he had grown up in. But, the Cordovas were forced out of Woodland Acres anyway. After Mrs Cordova, a schoolteacher, became prominent in a campaign by local mothers to force national environmental standards on the local industries, the couple began receiving death threats. In November 1999, someone blew the windows out of their car with a shotgun. That was too much, and the family moved to a suburb in north Houston earlier this year. They have yet to find jobs there and they are unable to sell their house in Woodland Acres. North Shore Supply offered $14,000, and Mr Cordova angrily turned them down. As far as the Cordovas are concerned, Mr Bush is entirely responsible for their plight. \"George Bush had the authority to do something about it, and he did nothing,\" Mrs Cordova said. The environment is one area where the Texas governor does wield almost absolute power. He is responsible for appointing the three members of the state regulatory board, the Texas Natural Resources Conservation Commission (TNRCC).

Expansion plans for Ashford in Kent, Milton Keynes, and Cambridgeshire, as well as a proposed Thames gateway \"linear city\" east of Dartford, are giving cause for concern. </p> <p>The agency is also pressing for an urgent meeting with the Greater London authority to discuss improving the Thames barrier, which was considered an adequate safeguard until 2030; one senior official said improvements would probably be necessary well before then. </p> <p>Immediate defence schemes will be needed to protect some of the 2m homes in England and Wales built on flood plains, invariably in the 70s and 80s when planning was relaxed. And, yesterday, the Association of British Insurers advised house buyers to employ surveyors to ask questions about flood risk before any exchange of contracts. </p> <p>The ABI's director general, Mary Francis, said they were concerned about how the government would find sufficient suitable land for 3m new homes in England by 2016.

      "bodyText": "Plans for tens of thousands of new houses, particularly for the south-east and East Anglia, may have to be redrawn or scrapped because of poor flood defences, the environment agency warned yesterday. Government departments, local councils and the agency plan to meet over the next few weeks to reassess drainage schemes amid growing concern about the risk to areas earmarked for big developments. Expansion plans for Ashford in Kent, Milton Keynes, and Cambridgeshire, as well as a proposed Thames gateway \"linear city\" east of Dartford, are giving cause for concern. The agency is also pressing for an urgent meeting with the Greater London authority to discuss improving the Thames barrier, which was considered an adequate safeguard until 2030; one senior official said improvements would probably be necessary well before then. Immediate defence schemes will be needed to protect some of the 2m homes in England and Wales built on flood plains, invariably in the 70s and 80s when planning was relaxed. And, yesterday, the Association of British Insurers advised house buyers to employ surveyors to ask questions about flood risk before any exchange of contracts. The ABI's director general, Mary Francis, said they were concerned about how the government would find sufficient suitable land for 3m new homes in England by 2016. The environment agency said many housing developments would have to be reconsidered or scrapped as too risky. The agency also said it was concerned about pockets of housing going ahead against its advice. \"We have worked hard at getting the message across to councils that they shouldn't allow developments in flood-risk areas,\" an official said. \"Some have heeded our advice, but small schemes are slipping through and they gradually build up to present a much bigger problem.\" Countryside groups also warned that developments would have to go back to the drawing board.

Sandy Bruce-Lockhart, leader of Kent county council, said his authority would ask the government to scale down housing projections. Kent is being told to take 129,000 houses by 2016 - 30% more than it wants.

      "body": "<p>Tim Westwood's bright red van is parked outside Radio 1. I know this because Tim Westwood's bright red van has his name painted on it in big white letters. Inside, a courier turns to a security guard. \"What the hell is that ?\" Another man walks in. \"Is that Tim Westwood's bloody van outside?\"</p> <p>Next comes the veteran DJ Simon Mayo. \"I see Tim Westwood's here.\" The first guy shakes his head. \"I'll tell you what that's about, Simon. M-O-N-E-Y.\"</p> <p>\"And the flava,\" Mayo deadpans. \"Don't forget the flava.\"</p> <p>As if. Because Tim Westwood has flava to burn. Two decades after making his debut as a pirate DJ, he is doing what he loves, playing the the latest in US rap. To the half million British fans who listen to his weekend shows on Radio 1, he is, quite simply, Westwood: the face of hip-hop.</p> <p>The white face of hip-hop. Straight outta Lowestoft, son of Bill, the late Bishop of Peterborough. No, make that the white, faintly wrinkled face of hip-hop, complete with transatlantic intonation and studied lexicon of mad skills and hot goddamn beats. Better yet, the white, faintly wrinkled, public-school-educated face of hip-hop, in his bright red van with his name painted on the side.</p> <p>There. You've had the cheap shots. It's not rocket science. While he may be Westwood to his fans, to detractors he's merely the real-life Ali G, a gibberish-spouting embarrassment, guilty of being entirely the wrong colour and class for his chosen profession. To the BBC, however, he is a godsend, a proven draw for otherwise indifferent \"urban\" (read black) listeners. Which is why, alongside Radio 1 publicist Paul, he is here in spotless camouflage, talking up his employer's plans for a new \"urban\" digital radio station.</p> <p>\"I believe in public service, man,\" he declares. \"I believe in serving the audience that supports you.\"</p> <p>An admirably Reithian sentiment. Only I feel obliged to mention that, by fronting a project designed for, to quote the Radio 1 blurb, a black audience under 24, he (neither black, nor under 24) is playing into his critics' hands. He bristles, just slightly.</p> <p>\"I'm here as a DJ, man. And I really feel that I can make a strong and positive contribution to the running of the station.\"</p> <p>He sounds as if he is at a job interview, and that is before he gives an exhaustive rundown of his CV (\"that's a lot of experience, man\"). Then he catches my eye. \"So ... what would these criticisms be, man?\"</p> <p>There is no chance to reply before Paul reminds me that the Radio 1 Rap Show is the BBC's best-performing programme with a young black audience. \"Right,\" Westwood nods emphatically. \"And I think I can offer experience on-air, in production, and also in management.\"</p> <p>Great. After all, no one would question his commitment. When he talks hip-hop, it's almost touching. For real. \"Come on, man. There's a multimillion dollar industry comin' outta hip-hop, man, outta people who would have had no choice but be sellin' drugs on the corner, man. Come on, man. That's a revolution, man. Respect it and be part of it, man.\"</p> <p>Except that, despite the enthusiasm, he seems wary. Defensive. Then again, you'd be touchy if you'd been shot at point-blank range at a set of south London traffic lights, as he was last July when two men fired repeatedly through his Range Rover window. The first bullet just missed his spine. Despite various conspiracy theories, no charges were brought. \"The police got a couple of people,\" he shrugs. \"Lack of evidence let 'em go. Just one of those things, man.\"</p> <p>No, to Westwood, the bitterest legacy of the shooting was his sniggering appropriation by the media. \"I been around forever, workin' for the hip-hop community, but before I got blasted, the press wasn't bothered, man. Then everyone wanted to know me.\"</p> <p>And to make a joke of him. Unkind voices even suggested that, in terms of credibility, getting shot was the best move of his career. So why does he think he provokes such hostility? \"I don't, man. I get tremendous love out there, man. Tremendous love.\"</p> <p>But not from the media. \"What, do you hate me?\"</p> <p>No, I say. I don't hate him at all.</p> <p>\"Then some of the media's feelin' me, man ... I don't know, man, some cats don't understand hip-hop, man. That's their issue, man.\"</p> <p>He's getting pricklier by the minute. Perhaps, like dogs smelling fear, the press have latched on to his reluctance to discuss his background. Take him at his word, and you would think he had come out of the womb spinning mad flavas.</p> <p>\"So? I'm a DJ, man. Talk to me about music, man. That's who I am, man. I'm not a \"- he spits the word - \"personality.\"</p> <p>But he has got a van outside with his name on it in 3ft-high letters. He hesitates. \"That's just a hot truck, man. Come on man. That's a lot of flava, man. A lot of flava. Paul? Are you feelin' me, Paul?\"</p> <p>Paul seems ambivalent. Anyway, that doesn't explain why he won't acknowledge his early life. \"OK, man. What d'you want to know, man?\"</p> <p>Regrettably, I ask about his first childhood memory. Five minutes later, he's still fuming. \"Childhood memory? How is that relevant to hip-hop, man? Damn, man. My first childhood memory isn't relevant, man. Come on, man. Ask me another.\"</p> <p>OK. \"How old are you?\"</p> <p>There is a very long silence. It seems a fair point. After the shooting, his age was given as everything from 30 to 42. \"So, how old are you?\"</p> <p>\"I'm 27.\"</p> <p>\"Tim, you're not. How old are you?\" \"I just told you my age, man. My age, right ... I'm going to tell you about my age. I don't want to be saying my age, man. My age, right ... it depends what paper you read. HAHAHA!\"</p> <p>I tell him I'm not trying to be funny.</p> <p>\"I am!\"</p> <p>\"How old are you?\"</p> <p>\"How old am I?

      "bodyText": "Tim Westwood's bright red van is parked outside Radio 1. I know this because Tim Westwood's bright red van has his name painted on it in big white letters. Inside, a courier turns to a security guard. \"What the hell is that ?\" Another man walks in. \"Is that Tim Westwood's bloody van outside?\" Next comes the veteran DJ Simon Mayo. \"I see Tim Westwood's here.\" The first guy shakes his head. \"I'll tell you what that's about, Simon. M-O-N-E-Y.\" \"And the flava,\" Mayo deadpans. \"Don't forget the flava.\" As if. Because Tim Westwood has flava to burn. Two decades after making his debut as a pirate DJ, he is doing what he loves, playing the the latest in US rap. To the half million British fans who listen to his weekend shows on Radio 1, he is, quite simply, Westwood: the face of hip-hop. The white face of hip-hop. Straight outta Lowestoft, son of Bill, the late Bishop of Peterborough. No, make that the white, faintly wrinkled face of hip-hop, complete with transatlantic intonation and studied lexicon of mad skills and hot goddamn beats. Better yet, the white, faintly wrinkled, public-school-educated face of hip-hop, in his bright red van with his name painted on the side. There. You've had the cheap shots. It's not rocket science. While he may be Westwood to his fans, to detractors he's merely the real-life Ali G, a gibberish-spouting embarrassment, guilty of being entirely the wrong colour and class for his chosen profession. To the BBC, however, he is a godsend, a proven draw for otherwise indifferent \"urban\" (read black) listeners. Which is why, alongside Radio 1 publicist Paul, he is here in spotless camouflage, talking up his employer's plans for a new \"urban\" digital radio station. \"I believe in public service, man,\" he declares. \"I believe in serving the audience that supports you.\" An admirably Reithian sentiment. Only I feel obliged to mention that, by fronting a project designed for, to quote the Radio 1 blurb, a black audience under 24, he (neither black, nor under 24) is playing into his critics' hands. He bristles, just slightly. \"I'm here as a DJ, man. And I really feel that I can make a strong and positive contribution to the running of the station.\" He sounds as if he is at a job interview, and that is before he gives an exhaustive rundown of his CV (\"that's a lot of experience, man\"). Then he catches my eye. \"So ... what would these criticisms be, man?\" There is no chance to reply before Paul reminds me that the Radio 1 Rap Show is the BBC's best-performing programme with a young black audience. \"Right,\" Westwood nods emphatically. \"And I think I can offer experience on-air, in production, and also in management.\" Great. After all, no one would question his commitment. When he talks hip-hop, it's almost touching. For real. \"Come on, man. There's a multimillion dollar industry comin' outta hip-hop, man, outta people who would have had no choice but be sellin' drugs on the corner, man. Come on, man. That's a revolution, man. Respect it and be part of it, man.\" Except that, despite the enthusiasm, he seems wary. Defensive. Then again, you'd be touchy if you'd been shot at point-blank range at a set of south London traffic lights, as he was last July when two men fired repeatedly through his Range Rover window. The first bullet just missed his spine. Despite various conspiracy theories, no charges were brought. \"The police got a couple of people,\" he shrugs. \"Lack of evidence let 'em go. Just one of those things, man.\" No, to Westwood, the bitterest legacy of the shooting was his sniggering appropriation by the media. \"I been around forever, workin' for the hip-hop community, but before I got blasted, the press wasn't bothered, man. Then everyone wanted to know me.\" And to make a joke of him. Unkind voices even suggested that, in terms of credibility, getting shot was the best move of his career. So why does he think he provokes such hostility? \"I don't, man. I get tremendous love out there, man. Tremendous love.\" But not from the media. \"What, do you hate me?\" No, I say. I don't hate him at all. \"Then some of the media's feelin' me, man ... I don't know, man, some cats don't understand hip-hop, man. That's their issue, man.\" He's getting pricklier by the minute. Perhaps, like dogs smelling fear, the press have latched on to his reluctance to discuss his background. Take him at his word, and you would think he had come out of the womb spinning mad flavas. \"So? I'm a DJ, man. Talk to me about music, man. That's who I am, man. I'm not a \"- he spits the word - \"personality.\" But he has got a van outside with his name on it in 3ft-high letters. He hesitates. \"That's just a hot truck, man. Come on man. That's a lot of flava, man. A lot of flava. Paul? Are you feelin' me, Paul?\" Paul seems ambivalent. Anyway, that doesn't explain why he won't acknowledge his early life. \"OK, man. What d'you want to know, man?\" Regrettably, I ask about his first childhood memory. Five minutes later, he's still fuming. \"Childhood memory? How is that relevant to hip-hop, man? Damn, man. My first childhood memory isn't relevant, man. Come on, man. Ask me another.\" OK. \"How old are you?\" There is a very long silence. It seems a fair point. After the shooting, his age was given as everything from 30 to 42. \"So, how old are you?\" \"I'm 27.\" \"Tim, you're not. How old are you?\" \"I just told you my age, man. My age, right ... I'm going to tell you about my age. I don't want to be saying my age, man. My age, right ... it depends what paper you read. HAHAHA!\" I tell him I'm not trying to be funny. \"I am!\" \"How old are you?\" \"How old am I? Depends what newspaper you read, man.\" \"No, how old are you?\" \"Yeah, and my answer, for the third time, is: it depends what newspaper you read, man. Yeah, man.\" He won't look me in the eye. Why won't he tell me how old he is? \"Because I have. Come on, man. You're makin' issues at this precise moment.\" I've heard blue-rinsed old ladies being less evasive. \"I'm 27, man.

      "body": "<p>The deputy prime minister made a statement on the storm havoc yesterday. This is the man who, at the Labour party confererence, took credit for the weather. \"No hosepipe bans!\" he boasted.</p> <p>Not yesterday. Only gentle summer rain, rain as warm and moist and welcome as a complimentary hot towelette, is brought to you by Labour governments. The disasters of this week are entirely due to Tory local authorities allowing houses to be built on flood plains. At last MPs have found a way of making the weather a party political issue. And they say the art of rhetoric is dead!</p> <p>As usual the House faced the terrifying Prescott wall of words, which sweeps down on a community of MPs, ripping out arguments, tearing down questions, hurling debris round members' knees. Often the hapless victims have no warning of what's on the way. For example, as the Lib Dems' Don Foster pointed out, the prime minister's press spokesman, Alastair Campbell, had said on Monday that he didn't expect there to be any statement on this topic today.</p> <p>At this, a freak surge burst the riverbank. Foaming and pounding, the deputy prime minister raged. \"Can I tell him that I make statements when I make them to this House. Nobody else is responsible, I am responsible to this House, no parliamentary, no news spokesman, if I decide it is right to make a statement to this House, that's what I do, that's what I have done, and it didn't come from anybody else!\"</p> <p>A rant like that could carry a whole field full of livestock down the river. But suddenly there was one of those moments of calm, perhaps at the eye of the hurricane. After what seemed like an eternity - it was maybe two seconds - he said: \"Oops, sorry Alastair\" to delighted laughter.</p> <p>But, as weathermen always say, there's more to come. \"In regard to funding, of course we have increased in considerably during our own resources between the Maff and ourselves, there has been an increase and what worries me most is we tend to plan for circumstances which are a lot less than we should readily expect now, what we assume to be extreme circumstances are being built into the structures we have,\" he said, the water gushing out as from a broken fire hydrant. Hansard writers, the fourth emergency service, struggled valiantly to bring help where it was most needed, but even they were helpless against the tide.</p> <p>Statistics came crashing past.

      "bodyText": "The deputy prime minister made a statement on the storm havoc yesterday. This is the man who, at the Labour party confererence, took credit for the weather. \"No hosepipe bans!\" he boasted. Not yesterday. Only gentle summer rain, rain as warm and moist and welcome as a complimentary hot towelette, is brought to you by Labour governments. The disasters of this week are entirely due to Tory local authorities allowing houses to be built on flood plains. At last MPs have found a way of making the weather a party political issue. And they say the art of rhetoric is dead! As usual the House faced the terrifying Prescott wall of words, which sweeps down on a community of MPs, ripping out arguments, tearing down questions, hurling debris round members' knees. Often the hapless victims have no warning of what's on the way. For example, as the Lib Dems' Don Foster pointed out, the prime minister's press spokesman, Alastair Campbell, had said on Monday that he didn't expect there to be any statement on this topic today. At this, a freak surge burst the riverbank. Foaming and pounding, the deputy prime minister raged. \"Can I tell him that I make statements when I make them to this House. Nobody else is responsible, I am responsible to this House, no parliamentary, no news spokesman, if I decide it is right to make a statement to this House, that's what I do, that's what I have done, and it didn't come from anybody else!\" A rant like that could carry a whole field full of livestock down the river. But suddenly there was one of those moments of calm, perhaps at the eye of the hurricane. After what seemed like an eternity - it was maybe two seconds - he said: \"Oops, sorry Alastair\" to delighted laughter. But, as weathermen always say, there's more to come. \"In regard to funding, of course we have increased in considerably during our own resources between the Maff and ourselves, there has been an increase and what worries me most is we tend to plan for circumstances which are a lot less than we should readily expect now, what we assume to be extreme circumstances are being built into the structures we have,\" he said, the water gushing out as from a broken fire hydrant. Hansard writers, the fourth emergency service, struggled valiantly to bring help where it was most needed, but even they were helpless against the tide. Statistics came crashing past. He was asked about the increased house building in the south-east. But the point about a maelstrom is that it always swirls where it is least expected. Suddenly, he was talking about failed water pumping structures on the east coast rail route. \"That was by alternative governments, so don't make that particular point, but we are now actually taking proper, putting the amount of resources and investment to move what we call extreme conditions which we must now regard as normal ... \"The Serplan [south-east regional plan] demand for housing was 33,000, I think when Professor Cope came along he suggested it was 55,000, we suggested that we would be 43,000 and the present building is about 39!\" This torrent brought misery and despair to the peaceful folk of the Conservative party who can have had no idea of the devastation about to be visited upon them.

      "bodyText": "The mysterious eleventh-hour evidence that threatens to destroy the crown's case in the Lockerbie trial is said to reveal how the bomb was made and how it got on board Pan Am Flight 103 in 1988. The Scottish court in the Netherlands heard yesterday that the defence for the two Libyan accused of responsibility had made inquiries in four separate countries, including the US and an unnamed Middle Eastern state, after it was given access to a dossier released by a \"foreign source\". This source is widely speculated to be Syria. The two accused have lodged a special defence of incrimination, blaming, among others, the Damascus-based Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command (PFLP-GC) for the Lockerbie bombing, which was the biggest act of mass murder in British history. A fourth adjournment to the trial since the dramatic evidence first came to light on October 4 was granted yesterday as the court was given, for the first time, a basic outline of its nature. Defence counsel William Taylor QC said: \"It [the evidence] purports to provide information as to the manufacture of the bomb and to give explanation as to how that bomb got on the plane.\" Mr Taylor said defence inquiries centred on a 1988 \"Autumn Leaves\" investigation by the German criminal intelligence agency, the BKA, which had led to the arrest of several Palestinians and the discovery of weapons and explosives. He said this established new links between the defence case and the PFLP-GC. When the BKA arrested two men during Autumn Leaves, one a known member of the PFLP-GC, it discovered a primed bomb planted within a Toshiba radio cassette recorder in the boot of their car. The crown alleges that the bomb that blew up Flight 103, killing all 269 passengers and crew on board and 11 on the ground, was inside a Toshiba radio cassette recorder. Investigations by Scottish police in the aftermath had first focused on Palestinian terrorist groups, before the emphasis was switched to Libya as being responsible. Since the defence was given access to the evidence last Monday, it has made worldwide investigations. Mr Taylor said that a member of the defence had travelled to Tripoli \"with a view to securing the opening of a communications route with another Middle Eastern state\". There has been widespread speculation that Syria is the source of the evidence, since its new leader, Bashar al-Assad, is thought to be keen to end its isolation from the west and to foster better relations with Libya. The evidence has also led to defence inquiries in a European country previously unconnected to the trial. Mr Taylor said two Scottish solicitors had used a Serbo-Croat translator during their investigations in that country. Despite the complex defence investigation and a prospect for further delays, Mr Taylor said he hoped he would be able to reconvene on Tuesday. \"We are operating to that timescale,\" he said. The crown has only a few days of its case against Abdelbaset Al Megrahi and Al Amin Khalifa Fhimah to run before it rests. The Libyans deny charges of murder, conspiracy to murder and breaching the Aviation Security Act. The final crucial witness called by the crown is expected to be Abu Talb, a Palestinian terrorist serving a life sentence in Sweden for bombing an airline office. However, Mr Talb is also accused by the defence of being responsible for the Lockerbie bombing. The defence case, which will attempt to lay the blame for the bombing on Palestinian terrorists, is expected to last around six weeks.",

The government is making contingency plans for a disaster with sheep, trying to identify flocks which appear genetically resistant to BSE-like diseases. The agency said that most animal experiments take a long time. A spokesman explained: \"We have to accept that decisions on the management of the epidemic and the protection of the public's health will continue to be based on an incomplete understanding of the science and will rely on expert judgments for years to come.\" Further bans on farm feeding practices that turn animals into cannibals were also urged in a draft report from the agency on anti-BSE controls. The agency wants EU partners to introduce further feed controls and ensure that pro-cessed meat products exported to this country state whether they contain mech-anically recovered meat made from high-pressure machines forcing meat off bones - often used in products such as burgers. Machine recovered meat from vertebral columns of cattle and sheep is banned. Other MRM is not, although products made in such a way in this country have to carry labels. The agency has been told that the use of sheep intestines for sausages in this country is low. The programme shows how seriously government bodies are taking the advice of the Phillips inquiry into BSE. BSE-like infectivity has not been found in experiments into cows' milk or poultry. Pigs have been infected experimentally by injection but not by feeding. Sheep have caught BSE after being fed infected cattle brain. The agency is dismayed that a new cattle tracking system meant to ensure animals can be traced is not watertight. Up to 10% of \"passports\" are not properly filled in.",

In an interview with the Guardian, the Taliban's foreign affairs spokesman, Faiz Ahmed Faiz, said Afghanistan had \"no difficulty\" with the US. \"We don't like the logic of intimidation and force. This is not rationalism,\" he said. The US has been actively considering targeting Bin Laden - one of Washington's most wanted terrorists - following the attack on the USS Cole in Aden on October 12 in which 17 US sailors were killed. The Americans have spent the past two-and-a-half weeks searching for hard evidence linking Bin Laden to the terrorist explosion and have placed their forces in the Gulf on a state of high alert. Western diplomats believe any missile strike would take place just before the US presidential elections next Tuesday - in time to gain maximum political mileage from an attack but too late for a counter-strike before the poll. Sources in Kabul say the Taliban have been \"panicked\" by the threat and have held a series of top-level meetings in Kandahar. \"We don't understand the reasons that enable the Americans to attack 20m people,\" Mr Faiz said. In a sign of growing anxiety, the Taliban authorities have asked a CNN crew to leave Kandahar, where Bin Laden has one of several hideouts, accusing it of causing tension. At the weekend, Pakistan, one of only three countries that recognise the Taliban, said it would not allow the US to use its airspace for a bombing mission. In August 1998, 13 days after accusing Bin Laden of carrying out the attacks on the US embassies in east Africa, the Americans fired 70 cruise missiles from a ship off Pakistan's coast at his camps around Khost and Jalalabad.

Reliant on a generator to provide electricity, Badakshan TV is the only television station left in Afghanistan.</p> <p>Tonight's news will, once again, lead with the war against the Taliban, the Islamic militia in control of most of Afghanistan, which has banned television, cinema, music, and most other forms of entertainment.</p> <p>Then, after prayers, the station will show another film from its collection of 1,200 old videos rescued from Kabul four years ago, just before the Taliban seized the capital.</p> <p>Perhaps it will be a cowboy film or a Hindi movie, all with subtitles in Dari, the Persian dialect widely spoken in this remote area of north-eastern Afghanistan which remains outside Taliban control.</p> <p>In a country shaped by 20 years of war, the station's most popular film comes as no surprise.</p> <p>\"Rambo, that's the one that everyone really enjoys,\" said Mohammad Din Kawahani, the station's director, chief correspondent and senior technician. \"People like that very much. Star Wars, that's another popular one.\"</p> <p>The fact that Badakshan TV can broadcast at all is a feat in itself. The station uses an ancient and immense Iranian transmitter, which barely covers the old quarter of Faizabad. There is just one television camera for filming.</p> <p>The old videos, which are the mainstay of the three-hour nightly broadcasts, are played on a 16-year-old Sony video machine for which there are no spare parts. The annual \u00a315,000 budget does not allow for much investment.</p> <p>Faizabad, which is home to the opposition's headquarters, is decidedly a low-tech town.

      "bodyText": "The television studios, perched on a mountainside overlooking the town of Faizabad, reek of diesel fuel. Reliant on a generator to provide electricity, Badakshan TV is the only television station left in Afghanistan. Tonight's news will, once again, lead with the war against the Taliban, the Islamic militia in control of most of Afghanistan, which has banned television, cinema, music, and most other forms of entertainment. Then, after prayers, the station will show another film from its collection of 1,200 old videos rescued from Kabul four years ago, just before the Taliban seized the capital. Perhaps it will be a cowboy film or a Hindi movie, all with subtitles in Dari, the Persian dialect widely spoken in this remote area of north-eastern Afghanistan which remains outside Taliban control. In a country shaped by 20 years of war, the station's most popular film comes as no surprise. \"Rambo, that's the one that everyone really enjoys,\" said Mohammad Din Kawahani, the station's director, chief correspondent and senior technician. \"People like that very much. Star Wars, that's another popular one.\" The fact that Badakshan TV can broadcast at all is a feat in itself. The station uses an ancient and immense Iranian transmitter, which barely covers the old quarter of Faizabad. There is just one television camera for filming. The old videos, which are the mainstay of the three-hour nightly broadcasts, are played on a 16-year-old Sony video machine for which there are no spare parts. The annual \u00a315,000 budget does not allow for much investment. Faizabad, which is home to the opposition's headquarters, is decidedly a low-tech town. The telephone network, an ageing Ericsson system, has just 600 lines and no numbers - callers must rely on the memory of the operator, Mohammad Raza, to put them through to the right destination. A US firm is now trying to set up a satellite telephone system to connect Faizabad to the other small towns in opposition areas. Mr Kawahani said that a quarter of the 100,000 people of Faizabad have a television. But it is unlikely that all the sets still work and, since the town has no electricity, viewers need an expensive generator or car battery to tune in. \"We are using the most primitive type of equipment. It is all completely out of date,\" said Mr Kawahani. The station has two large satellite dishes which allow it to receive international channels such as the BBC and CNN, but not to rebroadcast them to the viewers of Faizabad. Only 180 people in the town, among them aid workers and UN staff, have their own satellite receivers. \"We want the people to be informed about what is happening. The Taliban are totally against civilisation. Not only are there no human rights for women and girls, there is no television, no press, nothing.\" Originally, Badakshan TV, which was set up in 1986 during the Soviet occupation, simply rebroadcast programmes from the main Kabul station. When mojahedin factions took the capital in 1992 and forced out the pro-Soviet government, the station was closed. Now run by the former government of Burhanuddin Rabbani, who was overthrown by the Taliban in 1996, Badakshan TV's news programming is plainly opposed to the militia. \"We try to project things fairly to keep the people informed. But it is important to have propaganda against terrorism. It is good propaganda,\" the station director, Mr Kawahani, said.

Britain, and especially the Labour party, will feel the impact of this squeaker of a race.</p> <p>The US electorate should have no doubt as to what hangs on their decision. But, such are the talents of George W Bush and Al Gore, the voters still seem far from clear. For many, the two candidates are barely distinguishable on the issues - hence the emphasis on personality. That's a tribute to Bush's strategy of \"hugging\" Gore on policy - allowing the Democrat no real advantage on education or healthcare, for example- and a testament to Gore's timidity. The vice president has not dared mention the real differences between him and W, for fear of alienating the undecideds who will determine this contest.</p> <p>So he rarely utters a word about abortion rights, one of the few areas where the next president will be decisive. Whoever wins will appoint perhaps three or four new judges to the nine-member Supreme Court, replacing those due to retire. The current bench supports the 1973 Roe v Wade decision guaranteeing a woman's right to choose - but only by a knife-edge margin of five to four. Bush would appoint conservative, anti- abortion judges and, within a couple of years, the United States would become a land where no pregnancy can be legally terminated. Gore would uphold the 1973 right. Tuesday's poll is a referendum on abortion - but it suits neither candidate to say so. Bush does not want to alienate suburban women who support choice, and Gore is panicky about rural conservatives who oppose it. But ignore the silence: this election matters.</p> <p>Or reflect on one of the fatal flaws of American society: its love affair with the gun. In America 10 children or teenagers die from firearms every day, with 30,000 people of all ages killed a year. A Gore administration might propose an owners' registration system or a child-proof mechanism on the trigger (like those on any bottle of pills). But expect no action from President W. In Texas he approved legislation allowing people to carry a concealed weapon anywhere - including into a church or synagogue. One activist for the National Rifle Association, the gun lobby headed by Charlton Heston, has bragged that if W wins \"the NRA will have an office in the White House\". The candidates don't want to talk about it: Gore is anxious not to scare off gun owners in must-win states such as Pennsylvania or West Virginia. But the division is there.</p> <p>On the terrain where the candidates are most up-front the choice is just as plain. Voters can go for Bush's plan to blow the current surplus bonanza on a mix of spending programmes and a juicy tax cut, or they can plump for Gore who offers no such tax reduction. An independent forecast says the Bush scheme would see the surplus swallowed up by 2012, plunging America back into deficit. Interest rates would head back up and the good times would be over. That's the choice.</p> <p>There's also a subtler decision to be made on Tuesday. For there is more to the presidency than making laws: it's also a social, even a cultural job.</p> <p>A president is not a prime minister. Head of government is only one of his duties; he also has to serve as leader of the American tribe and virtual father to the nation. Only this explains the reverence shown to past presidents, the enshrining of their papers in well-funded libraries, the enduring interest in the lives of a Kennedy or Roosevelt.</p> <p>This role, easily overlooked, is also on the line next week. Whoever wins will set the cultural tone for the nation. Just think of Bill Clinton's impact: future generations will see his as the iconic face of the 1990s, representing not just politics, but the entire spirit of the times.</p> <p>This is the role scholar Fred Greenstein, in a new book, The Presidential Difference, calls \"preaching and teaching\". It is central to the office. If Gore takes the nation's \"bully pulpit\" his sermons would be dull, but they would at least address the big questions of the present and future, from the internet to the environment.</p> <p>But what if Bush becomes America's high preacher? What mood would his presence create? The Dubya era would probably feel like the moment when the US decided to shy away from the future, to retreat into comfortable simplicities personified by a man who revelled in his lack of sophistication. It would herald America's stepping back from the scariness of the 21st century, opting instead for the plaid-shirt cosiness of a high-born Forrest Gump.</p> <p>We would get caught up in that undertow, too, just as we have lived through the Clinton era. But we would also feel a more direct effect, most immediately on foreign policy. A Bush White House would be keen to turn away from Europe, to distance itself from Clinton's efforts in the Balkans and Northern Ireland and to focus instead on Latin America.</p> <p>A secondary impact will be on the modern brand of special relationship, the one that's really mattered this last decade: the bond not so much between Britain and the US, as between Labour and the Democrats. If Gore loses, the Clinton-Blair partnership in power will be broken: one half of the transatlantic couple would suddenly be in the cold.</p> <p>Besides the PR blow - and the inevitable perception that the global centre-left's glory days are over and that low-tax, small-government conservatism is back - there would be a more substantive problem. Labour has borrowed much from its Clintonian cousins, whether Jack Straw's teenage curfews or Gordon Brown's working families tax credit. That transfer was easy when the American ideas were coated in the shiny gloss of electoral success. But why adopt them when they're tainted with failure? How easy would it be for Brown, an enthusiast for the American system, to persuade the Labour party to look west if the US becomes Bush country once more?</p> <p>The response is already being prepared. One of the human linchpins to the Labour-Democrat relationship told me yesterday that the modernisers, both here and in America, will simply argue that Gore's defeat came because \"he went too far to the left, he became too associated with 'big government'.\" The lesson New Labour wants to learn from Gore's struggle is that, \"you have to hold the centre\".</p> <p>But these are arguments Labour would rather not have to make.

      "body": "<p>Civil servants were yesterday accused by MPs of a cover-up, after they suppressed information on plans to tackle a predicted rise in deaths and pollution-related illness caused by a new generation of waste-burning incinerators.</p> <p>Ministers were furious that the information had not been highlighted to them - days after Lord Phillips, the law lord who headed the BSE inquiry, had condemned the secrecy across Whitehall.</p> <p>Michael Meacher, the environment minister, said: \"I cannot recall seeing these figures and as I have specifically asked civil servants to highlight any information and not hide it away in annexes I shall be taking this up immediately.

      "bodyText": "Civil servants were yesterday accused by MPs of a cover-up, after they suppressed information on plans to tackle a predicted rise in deaths and pollution-related illness caused by a new generation of waste-burning incinerators. Ministers were furious that the information had not been highlighted to them - days after Lord Phillips, the law lord who headed the BSE inquiry, had condemned the secrecy across Whitehall. Michael Meacher, the environment minister, said: \"I cannot recall seeing these figures and as I have specifically asked civil servants to highlight any information and not hide it away in annexes I shall be taking this up immediately. As for not being consulted about whether this information should be released, I shall be demanding an explanation from the environment agency.\" Last night, Christine Butler, MP for Castle Point in Essex, backed up Mr Meacher's stand, saying Whitehall's behaviour \"resembled the secretive attitudes of civil servants in the way they handled BSE\". The disclosure of Whitehall's refusal to release correspondence between the agency and the ministry on plans to tackle the problem of deaths was revealed in evidence from Alan Watson, an engineer, and Keith Collins, an economist, of Public Interest Consultants, a not-for-profit consultancy, to the Commons environment committee. It comes after the Department of Environment released figures showing that at present 88 people die and 168 people are hospitalised every year for lung-related diseases associated with emissions from the country's 12 incinerators. The detailed report also said people's lives will be shortened by cancer-causing dioxins from incinerators. Plans to at least double or even triple the number of incinerators could see the number of deaths rise to 100 and possibly higher each year. Mr Collins told MPs that Mr Watson had used the European Union open government code for environmental information - which is less secretive than the government's new freedom of information bill - to try to obtain the release of correspondence between the environment agency and the ministry. Both have admitted to holding meetings and planning how they intend to tackle health hazards caused by new incinerators and how they could affect the environment and the food chain. Confidential minutes of the latest meeting of the environment agency board on October 13 say: \"The agency has been discussing with the department of the environment, transport and the regions and the department of health, the development of a national, rather than agency, policy on health impacts from incineration.\" But officials from both ministries refused to release the correspondence to Mr Watson saying that it should be regarded as policy advice and \"could adversely affect future working relationships and policy development with the department of health.\" When Mr Watson appealed, officials said it would cost him \u00a3200 for the environment agency to conduct a full search and then claimed no such correspondence existed. This contradicted minutes sent to Mr Watson by the Department of Health showing a draft paper had been sent in July by the environment agency to the ministry on death and illness figures from air pollution from incinerators. Stefan Carlyle, head of scientific and technical information service of the agency, also told him that ministers had not been consulted about the refusal to release the information: \"I can inform you that Mr Meacher was not advised of our decision.\" Andrew Bennett, Labour chairman of the environment committee, last night demanded to see the correspondence between Mr Watson and the ministries.",

No one can condone the frenzied killing of these two Israeli soldiers and the perpetrators will certainly be called to account - unlike the soldiers responsible for killing the 12-year-old Palestinian boy.</p> <p>But why did Madeleine Albright present her immediate condolence to the families of these two Israeli soldiers, when more than a fortnight has passed without any such comments for the families of the dozens of killed Palestinian civilians?</p> <p>And she persistently refers to \"violence on both sides\" (regardless of the obvious disparity between a nuclear state and a lightly-armed police force. At the last count, there were 126 Palestinian fatalities, 35% under the age of 15, 4,000 Palestinian casualties and seven Israeli fatalities). In the presidential elections Al Gore and George Bush were forced in one of their first debates to compete in an almost farcical fashion over who would be more loyal to Israel. Gore, the clear winner, who has built his career on support from the Jewish lobby, said he would pressure Yasser Arafat to stop \"provocative acts of violence\".</p> <p>Hillary Clinton, who a year ago called for a Palestinian state, has been forced into a complete U-turn in her Senate campaign. The Jews have been remarkably successful as a people, despite historic adversity. As a result, the Israeli lobby in the US is rich and influential. The media are largely controlled by the Jews, as is Hollywood and they account for more than half the top policy-making jobs in the Clinton administration.</p> <p>Driving to pick up my son from school yesterday, I was horrified to see a freshly painted red sign on a wall: \"Kill all Jews. Jihad\". And a statement has just been issued from a London based Islamist group that \"all Jews and Americans have now become targets in the Muslim lands as a result of American policy\". Abhorrent as this kind of extremism may be, it is a direct result of what Muslims see as gross injustice, due to overwhelming Jewish influence in US politics and the media. The situation can only worsen, with an increase in fundamentalism.</p> <p>Many of my friends are Jewish, as was my paternal grandfather. The sad part is that I know the majority of them desperately want peace in the Middle East, but that peace can only be achieved once the US acts as an honest broker, and the US media as impartial commentators.</p> <p>Jemima and Imran Khan live in Islamabad</p>",

But why did Madeleine Albright present her immediate condolence to the families of these two Israeli soldiers, when more than a fortnight has passed without any such comments for the families of the dozens of killed Palestinian civilians? And she persistently refers to \"violence on both sides\" (regardless of the obvious disparity between a nuclear state and a lightly-armed police force. At the last count, there were 126 Palestinian fatalities, 35% under the age of 15, 4,000 Palestinian casualties and seven Israeli fatalities). In the presidential elections Al Gore and George Bush were forced in one of their first debates to compete in an almost farcical fashion over who would be more loyal to Israel. Gore, the clear winner, who has built his career on support from the Jewish lobby, said he would pressure Yasser Arafat to stop \"provocative acts of violence\". Hillary Clinton, who a year ago called for a Palestinian state, has been forced into a complete U-turn in her Senate campaign. The Jews have been remarkably successful as a people, despite historic adversity. As a result, the Israeli lobby in the US is rich and influential. The media are largely controlled by the Jews, as is Hollywood and they account for more than half the top policy-making jobs in the Clinton administration. Driving to pick up my son from school yesterday, I was horrified to see a freshly painted red sign on a wall: \"Kill all Jews. Jihad\". And a statement has just been issued from a London based Islamist group that \"all Jews and Americans have now become targets in the Muslim lands as a result of American policy\". Abhorrent as this kind of extremism may be, it is a direct result of what Muslims see as gross injustice, due to overwhelming Jewish influence in US politics and the media. The situation can only worsen, with an increase in fundamentalism. Many of my friends are Jewish, as was my paternal grandfather. The sad part is that I know the majority of them desperately want peace in the Middle East, but that peace can only be achieved once the US acts as an honest broker, and the US media as impartial commentators.

      "body": "<p><strong> The south-east</strong> </p> <p> Eleven severe flood warnings were in force last night, but river levels were starting to recede. With no significant rainfall expected in the next 36 hours the situation looks set to improve. Nearly all the motorways are free of flood water, though last night the M11 at Loughton remained treacherous, and the A3 from the M25 to Ripley, Surrey, was closed. The underground, which cancelled trains yesterday because of power failures and fallen trees, was almost back to normal last night. There were delays on South Central and Connex South Eastern trains but Eurostar, Gatwick Express and Heathrow Express ran normally. Dover ferry services stayed restricted. Electricity companies said last night they hoped to restore power to homes within 24 hours. </p> <p> <strong> East Anglia</strong> </p> <p> Severe flood warnings at Alconbury Brook and on the river Kym in Cambridgeshire have been downgraded; the only severe warning was for the region Nene downstream of Northampton. Further rain of up to 14mm is forecast for the next 24 hours. The environment agency warned that as flood plains in the region remain saturated the possibility of further flooding is high. Suffolk police warned motorists about surface water. Railway services were still restricted due to track repair work, but First Great Eastern said the problems caused by the storms were largely overcome. Eastern Electricity restored power to all but 2,000 of 50,000 affected homes. </p> <p> <strong> The north-east</strong> </p> <p> The worst floods for half a century hit Yorkshire and parts of the north east yesterday, as water sluiced off the Pennines. Leeds central roads turned into canals last night as the river Aire brimmed over embankments normally standing 25ft or more above water level. Hundreds were evacuated from smaller towns closer to the fells as the Aire and the Wharfe overflowed. Families camped in Bingley arts centre; in Skipton and Keighley, B&amp;Bs and the town's swimming pool became emergency homes. Electricity sub-stations closed leading to power shortages, and schools shut down along the river valleys. Airedale, Wharfedale and the Ouse plain around York, saw floods; the swollen river Nidd caused the rescue by ferry of 24 from a caravan park at Knaresborough. In Northumberland, a man died after a collision in his van at 6.40am with a gritter near the A19 near Seaton Burn, police said. Three others were injured, one seriously. </p> <p> <strong> The north-west</strong> </p> <p> More than 60 people, mostly pensioners, were waiting to return to their homes in Northwich, Cheshire, after the rivers Weaver and Dane burst their banks in the worst floods since 1946. Water levels rose by 1.5m in the early hours of yesterday morning. Sporadic showers continued and residents were evacuated from Garstang and Ribchester in Lancashire after debris blown into brooks and drains caused flooding, and the river Ribble swelled. Some roads had been under 3ftof water. AA Roadwatch North West said Lancashire roads were \"atrocious\". In Pilling, roads were closed to avoid structural damage to houses from water splashing. In Todmorden, the A646 was closed after a bridge collapsed. Transport in the region was an improvement on Monday's chaos. First North Western Trains returned to normal, running at minimal speeds south of Lancaster where a track had been cleared through yesterday's landslides. </p> <p> <strong> Midlands</strong> </p> <p> As the sun began to shine again yesterday and transport services got back to near normal, there were warning of floods from rivers in counties bordering Wales. Warnings cover the Wye at Hay, Hereford, the Ross-on-Wye, and the Monnow atSkenfrith, south of Hereford. Levels on the Severn were reported to be as high as during the floods of October 1998, and severe flood warnings were issued for Worcester, and for Shrewsbury, Bewdley and Ironbridge in Shropshire. Floods were expected to hit Bewdley and Bridgnorth. The river Teme was also in danger of flooding. There were no train services yesterday between Shrewsbury and Chester, and Shrewsbury and Machynlleth, and because local roads were impassable no bus services laid on instead. Birmingham's New Street station became a temporary terminus as many trains from Scotland and northern England to south Wales and the west country went no further. Local trains from Birmingham to Lichfield terminated at New Street because of power line problems. </p> <p> <strong> The south-west</strong> </p> <p> Rail travellers in the south west are facing disruption for several days to come from flooded tracks and tunnels. Although Paddington-Bristol services have resumed on a reduced timetable other services into the west country are stopping at Taunton. Passengers heading further west are being taken by bus to Exeter to pick up connections. A Railtrack spokesman warned that flooding between Exeter and Taunton could take up to three days to recede, and longer if the weather worsens. Sapperton tunnel, between Swindon and Gloucester, was expected to be closed for four weeks through flood damage. The flooded Chipping Sodbury tunnel was affecting mainline services between Swindon and Bristol Parkway and onward to south Wales. Severe flood warnings were last night in place on the river Avon at Bradford-on-Avon and between Melksham and Bathford as well as on the Lower Stour in Dorset. On the Avon river levels stayed high at Malmesbury and Bradford. </p> <p> <strong> Wales</strong> </p> <p> Bangor-on-Dee in north Wales was standing by for possible evacuation again last night as the lower Dee came dangerously close to overtopping its banks. Police and local authority officials were advising residents to leave home for safety reasons. The Dee was one of three Welsh rivers on which severe flood warnings remained in place yesterday. The Wye and Monnow in south-east Wales continued to cause concern; the environment agency was monitoring the situation at Monmouth and Ross-on-Wye. Train services continued to face disruption because of line closures, and several major roads remained impassable. The A465 Heads of the Valleys road, one of the principal road arteries in south Wales, is expected to be closed until next week after a landslip near Brynmawr involving tonnes of mud and debris. In mid Wales, flooding closed the main road between </p> <p>Welshpool and Newtown. The road linking Bangor-on-Dee and Wrexham was also closed through flooding. Power was being restored yesterday to the last of the 30,000 customers cut off by the weekend gale. </p> <p> <strong> Scotland</strong> </p> <p> Scotland escaped the bad weather which affected so many of the southern areas yesterday and the only problems were a hangover from the weekend. Train services between Glasgow and Edinburgh were down to one train each hour from the normal four because of a landslip, caused by heavy rain, which then blocked the railway line. But the services on the west and east coast mainlines were by yesterday getting back to the normal schedule. </p> <p> Reports by Jamie Wilson, Martin Wainwright, Angelique Chrisafis, Geoffrey Gibbs, David Ward, Gerry Seenan</p>",

      "body": "<p>Big names in rock'n'roll proved at the Q Awards in London yesterday that while British pop may be on the ropes it is not quite out.</p> <p>Despite the declining singles market, the likes of Oasis, their arch-rival Robbie Williams and the Chemical Brothers were in the mood to celebrate at the 11th annual event, staged by Britain's biggest selling music monthly.</p> <p>Q's 196,000 sales put it 50% ahead of its nearest rival in a sector that has been in a slump since the mid-1990s, and its success guaranteed a high celebrity count.</p> <p>The famous are drawn as much by the likelihood of seeing other famous people make fools of themselves as by the gold trophies. This year, with both Oasis and Williams nominated, promised to be memorable. Liam Gallagher did not disappoint his audience, receiving Oasis's best live act gong with the comment: \"This one's for Robbie, as usual. Fuck off.\"</p> <p>Afterwards Gallagher, who is dating Williams's former fiancee, Nicole Appleton of All Saints, said: \"I don't hate him, I just think he's rubbish. If he slags my band off, he slags my girlfriend off and he slags my brother off, I'll have him.\"</p> <p>Collecting the classic songwriter award, Williams said: \"I'm just going to keep my gob shut.\"</p> <p>Few others did. This year's surprise hits, Coldplay, accepted best album by inviting best newcomer, Badly Drawn Boy, outside for a fight, while Blur's Alex James bickered with Liam Gallagher.</p> <p>Kylie Minogue, who performs with Williams on his current hit, threatened to slap Gallagher when he heckled her. Perhaps their tetchiness was provoked by a report in the trade magazine Music Week that singles sales are down 22% on last year, while the top selling album of 2000, Play by Moby, was released in 1999.

      "bodyText": "Big names in rock'n'roll proved at the Q Awards in London yesterday that while British pop may be on the ropes it is not quite out. Despite the declining singles market, the likes of Oasis, their arch-rival Robbie Williams and the Chemical Brothers were in the mood to celebrate at the 11th annual event, staged by Britain's biggest selling music monthly. Q's 196,000 sales put it 50% ahead of its nearest rival in a sector that has been in a slump since the mid-1990s, and its success guaranteed a high celebrity count. The famous are drawn as much by the likelihood of seeing other famous people make fools of themselves as by the gold trophies. This year, with both Oasis and Williams nominated, promised to be memorable. Liam Gallagher did not disappoint his audience, receiving Oasis's best live act gong with the comment: \"This one's for Robbie, as usual. Fuck off.\" Afterwards Gallagher, who is dating Williams's former fiancee, Nicole Appleton of All Saints, said: \"I don't hate him, I just think he's rubbish. If he slags my band off, he slags my girlfriend off and he slags my brother off, I'll have him.\" Collecting the classic songwriter award, Williams said: \"I'm just going to keep my gob shut.\" Few others did. This year's surprise hits, Coldplay, accepted best album by inviting best newcomer, Badly Drawn Boy, outside for a fight, while Blur's Alex James bickered with Liam Gallagher. Kylie Minogue, who performs with Williams on his current hit, threatened to slap Gallagher when he heckled her. Perhaps their tetchiness was provoked by a report in the trade magazine Music Week that singles sales are down 22% on last year, while the top selling album of 2000, Play by Moby, was released in 1999. It has been such a slack year that the lifetime achievement award was suspended because organisers could not find anyone willing to turn up for it. \"It was supposed to be Bob Dylan, but they couldn't get him,\" said an insider. It would not have been enough for Dylan to send his best wishes on video: \"They have to come in person.\" The former Clash frontman Joe Strummer, a fit 48, was applauded when he admitted that his inspiration gong was the first he had received in a 25-year career. Even the Gallaghers were silenced when he said his talent was dwarfed by that of The Who, with whom he is on tour. Such generosity is not the norm at award events. Other winners such as David Gray, best single, and Travis, best act, confirmed that after years of domination by dance music, rock is making a comeback.

      "body": "<p>Just when you think born-again Christians are actually quite nice, they go and spoil it all by reverting to type. Unhappily - especially for Grace, the subject of <strong> Everyman</strong> (BBC1) - type is hypocritical, unforgiving, sanctimonious fundamentalists with absolutely no grasp of what JC Superstar meant when he said \"Love thy neighbour.\" They may play guitars and clap their hands but so did Status Quo and it didn't make them good people either. </p> <p>Grace was released from prison after serving 18 years of a mandatory life sentence for stabbing a man to death. Then a booze-swilling, drug-using prostitute, on her release she was a born-again Christian married to a troubled but loving man, Anthony, and determined to do and be good in a world that probably doesn't deserve her. Armed with her faith, a ferret and \u00a381 in cash, Grace's release and her subsequent struggles made for an extraordinary, honest and moving story which was more than done justice by a mature, considered and technically accomplished documentary. </p> <p>With insights from Gitta Sereny and Kent's chief probation officer, Grace's personal journey became a wider exploration and insight into the plight of those released from prison who seek to stay straight. With the excellent Pete Postlethwaite mesmerising in The Sins and Lord Woolf's judgement on Jon Venables and Robert Thompson, Everyman couldn't have come at a better time to contribute to the discussion of life after crime, the shortsightedness of the rabid, hang 'em reactionaries and how civilised (or not) a society we are. </p> <p>As Grace learned to adjust to a world nearly two decades older than when she left it, her faith and spirit frequently tested, it was made apparent that her chosen church was abandoning her. Volunteering to help run a playgroup for the children of her fellow Christians, Grace was rejected by the elders because they felt she couldn't be trusted. While it is understandable they fear headlines like \"Crazy Christians Hire Murderess As Nanny\", as people who purport to be religious, they should be ashamed of their ignorant, unchristian behaviour. </p> <p>When her relationship with Anthony also started to falter, it was hard not to feel for Grace, who more than lived up to her name. As she poured her heart out on a roundabout in the park (these things happen in the strangest places), she cried. She wasn't the only one. As they say in the Bible, Jesus wept. </p> <p>At least you know where you are with a Satanist. And you are probably in a scary place with lots of black drapes, candles, a pentagram on the floor and an inverted cross on the wall somewhere.

      "bodyText": "Just when you think born-again Christians are actually quite nice, they go and spoil it all by reverting to type. Unhappily - especially for Grace, the subject of Everyman (BBC1) - type is hypocritical, unforgiving, sanctimonious fundamentalists with absolutely no grasp of what JC Superstar meant when he said \"Love thy neighbour.\" They may play guitars and clap their hands but so did Status Quo and it didn't make them good people either. Grace was released from prison after serving 18 years of a mandatory life sentence for stabbing a man to death. Then a booze-swilling, drug-using prostitute, on her release she was a born-again Christian married to a troubled but loving man, Anthony, and determined to do and be good in a world that probably doesn't deserve her. Armed with her faith, a ferret and \u00a381 in cash, Grace's release and her subsequent struggles made for an extraordinary, honest and moving story which was more than done justice by a mature, considered and technically accomplished documentary. With insights from Gitta Sereny and Kent's chief probation officer, Grace's personal journey became a wider exploration and insight into the plight of those released from prison who seek to stay straight. With the excellent Pete Postlethwaite mesmerising in The Sins and Lord Woolf's judgement on Jon Venables and Robert Thompson, Everyman couldn't have come at a better time to contribute to the discussion of life after crime, the shortsightedness of the rabid, hang 'em reactionaries and how civilised (or not) a society we are. As Grace learned to adjust to a world nearly two decades older than when she left it, her faith and spirit frequently tested, it was made apparent that her chosen church was abandoning her. Volunteering to help run a playgroup for the children of her fellow Christians, Grace was rejected by the elders because they felt she couldn't be trusted. While it is understandable they fear headlines like \"Crazy Christians Hire Murderess As Nanny\", as people who purport to be religious, they should be ashamed of their ignorant, unchristian behaviour. When her relationship with Anthony also started to falter, it was hard not to feel for Grace, who more than lived up to her name. As she poured her heart out on a roundabout in the park (these things happen in the strangest places), she cried. She wasn't the only one. As they say in the Bible, Jesus wept. At least you know where you are with a Satanist. And you are probably in a scary place with lots of black drapes, candles, a pentagram on the floor and an inverted cross on the wall somewhere. Such a delightful scene brings us neatly to Home Front (BBC2), specifically the new-look Home Front which is presented by Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen and Diarmuid Gavin.

In fact, the stock does not look much more expensive than sluggish old British Airways. Retail punters, sadly, are locked out of this flotation, with all the stock going to institutions. But for any size of investor, this issue is not really about comparable valuations and the like. It is about whether this bucaneering entrepreneur, who wants all his staff to get rich on options and who will stand up and scream if his commercial interests are threatened, deserves personal backing. And in the interests of a more colourful world, the answer has got be be \"yes.\"",

There is something desperately childlike about her. As the last notes die away, a nurse appears and gently leads her away. She shuffles along, suddenly old all over again. </p> <p>The old lady has barely departed before an octogenarian in drag, his eyelashes fluttering like butterflies, launches into Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend. At the end he whips off his platinum wig to reveal a polished bald head winking in the light. </p> <p>If a bunch of pensioners singing songs by the Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, Elvis Presley and the Clash isn't high on the list of things that you are keen to experience, you are not alone. I have to admit that I too had my doubts about Road to Heaven - a show performed by 23 Americans aged between 70 and 90 who call themselves the Young @ Heart Chorus - despite the fact that it has become a cult hit in mainland Europe and the US. </p> <p>But at the Restless Gravity festival in Aberystwyth last weekend, bemusement gave way to fascination, and fascination to emotion. By the show's carefully calculated end, a large proportion of the audience - aged roughly between five and 90 - were on their feet, weeping and clapping. And it wasn't just at the sight of someone old enough to be a grandfather doing It's Not Unusual, or a crowd of senior citizens giving a deadpan rendition of Satisfaction. After all, Tom Jones will soon be queuing up for his bus pass and some of the Stones are grandparents. There is more to Road to Heaven than the elderly making a spectacle of themselves. </p> <p>When the show opens in London tonight under the auspices of the London International Festival of Theatre (Lift), it will raise debate about not only our perceptions of old people but also about the nature of theatre itself - what it is, who it is for and who can do it. It is not by chance that Road to Heaven is the opening salvo in a new Lift initiative that sees the festival move from being a biennial affair to taking its place as a regular year-round producer. </p> <p>Over the past 20 years, Lift's championing of international theatre and home-grown site-specific pieces has done more than anything else to change British ideas about theatre's place in our culture. Road to Heaven is part of that debate, a show that on paper should make you cringe but actually makes you cheer. </p> <p>The Young @ Heart Chorus began in 1981 as an activity at a lunch club for poor pensioners in Northampton, Massachusetts. The food was so dreary that organiser Bob Cilman decided to liven things up with a piano and a singsong. That lead to community shows. But it was the arrival of Roy Faudree, an associate of the avant-garde American theatre collective the Wooster Group who also runs his own company, No Theater, that took Young @ Heart into a new dimension. </p> <p>Faudree was interested in the idea of the elderly as potential artists, and wondered what would happen if, instead of singing pre-war golden-oldie standards, the chorus sang pop songs - the very songs that many of them had told their own children and grandchildren to turn down during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. Would the glib lyrics penned by youngsters mean something different and fresh if sung by the very old? </p> <p>Faudree explains it this way: \"If you put an ashtray on a table, it is just an ashtray. If you put a torn glove beside it, it becomes drama. With this show I was trying to create a dramatic landscape and startling juxtapositions.\" How far it works can be seen from a song such as I Will Survive, which is transformed from a strutting disco anthem into something both absurdly tender and defiant when sung by a frail 80-year-old. </p> <p>Although Road to Heaven uses material culled from previous Young @ Heart shows, its crazy quilt effect is all the more powerful because of the way Faudree frames the show. It is set on the geriatric ward of a hospital or in an old people's home, and a conductor tries to drill the chorus into shape, into some kind of homogeneous whole. But it is the individuality of each member of the chorus that stands out, even down to the way that their lumpy, bumpy bodies - quite unlike the sleek-toned forms we are so used to seeing on stage - refuse to be invisible. In their Elvis Presley costumes, or perhaps dressed up as bees, these people show a kind of don't-give-a-damn defiance that you normally associate only with very young children. As Lucy Neal of Lift says: \"Part of the appeal of the show is that it is deliciously improper.\" </p> <p>After years of involvement Faudree says he still can't put his finger on why audiences respond so strongly to Young @ Heart, or even why he himself remains involved with the project when he is much in demand elsewhere as a director. \"I think it is because every time I go into rehearsal with these people and I am feeling tired and distracted I end up in a good mood. There is something joyous about it, and that's what the audience gets too. Bob Cilman has a theory that the reason the audience reacts so positively is because it makes them confront their own mortality.\" </p> <p>Certainly, Road to Heaven is a rare acknowledgement that none of us is as young as we were and that we are all dying. But hell, we can have some fun as we do. Road to Heaven suggests that old age doesn't have to be all Zimmer frames and regret. When the chorus sings Forever Young it doesn't sound like wishful thinking. It sounds like a manifesto, a statement of intent, a wake-up call. </p> <p>\u0095 At the Lyric Hammersmith, London W6 (020-8741 2311), from November 1-4.</p>",

Over the past 20 years, Lift's championing of international theatre and home-grown site-specific pieces has done more than anything else to change British ideas about theatre's place in our culture. Road to Heaven is part of that debate, a show that on paper should make you cringe but actually makes you cheer. The Young @ Heart Chorus began in 1981 as an activity at a lunch club for poor pensioners in Northampton, Massachusetts. The food was so dreary that organiser Bob Cilman decided to liven things up with a piano and a singsong. That lead to community shows. But it was the arrival of Roy Faudree, an associate of the avant-garde American theatre collective the Wooster Group who also runs his own company, No Theater, that took Young @ Heart into a new dimension. Faudree was interested in the idea of the elderly as potential artists, and wondered what would happen if, instead of singing pre-war golden-oldie standards, the chorus sang pop songs - the very songs that many of them had told their own children and grandchildren to turn down during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. Would the glib lyrics penned by youngsters mean something different and fresh if sung by the very old? Faudree explains it this way: \"If you put an ashtray on a table, it is just an ashtray. If you put a torn glove beside it, it becomes drama. With this show I was trying to create a dramatic landscape and startling juxtapositions.\" How far it works can be seen from a song such as I Will Survive, which is transformed from a strutting disco anthem into something both absurdly tender and defiant when sung by a frail 80-year-old. Although Road to Heaven uses material culled from previous Young @ Heart shows, its crazy quilt effect is all the more powerful because of the way Faudree frames the show. It is set on the geriatric ward of a hospital or in an old people's home, and a conductor tries to drill the chorus into shape, into some kind of homogeneous whole. But it is the individuality of each member of the chorus that stands out, even down to the way that their lumpy, bumpy bodies - quite unlike the sleek-toned forms we are so used to seeing on stage - refuse to be invisible. In their Elvis Presley costumes, or perhaps dressed up as bees, these people show a kind of don't-give-a-damn defiance that you normally associate only with very young children. As Lucy Neal of Lift says: \"Part of the appeal of the show is that it is deliciously improper.\" After years of involvement Faudree says he still can't put his finger on why audiences respond so strongly to Young @ Heart, or even why he himself remains involved with the project when he is much in demand elsewhere as a director. \"I think it is because every time I go into rehearsal with these people and I am feeling tired and distracted I end up in a good mood. There is something joyous about it, and that's what the audience gets too. Bob Cilman has a theory that the reason the audience reacts so positively is because it makes them confront their own mortality.\" Certainly, Road to Heaven is a rare acknowledgement that none of us is as young as we were and that we are all dying. But hell, we can have some fun as we do. Road to Heaven suggests that old age doesn't have to be all Zimmer frames and regret. When the chorus sings Forever Young it doesn't sound like wishful thinking. It sounds like a manifesto, a statement of intent, a wake-up call. \u0095 At the Lyric Hammersmith, London W6 (020-8741 2311), from November 1-4.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>One of the most difficult experiences recalled by Magnum photographer Eve Arnold is her close encounter with Joseph McCarthy at his witchhunt hearings in Washington. It was 1954 and Arnold had only been working as a photographer for two years. What was the experience like? \"Terrible,\" she shudders. </p> <p>\"He had a kind of oily charm. I had come late to the hearings and his secretary said she should introduce me before I went in. McCarthy held up the meetings in order to speak to one freelance photographer. Everything had to come his way, all the publicity.\" </p> <p>She then experienced the same paralysing fear that countless Americans had experienced at the hands of McCarthy. \"I was the only woman in the press corps,\" she says. \"So when we broke for lunch McCarthy came over and put his arm around my shoulder. I put my hand up to remove his hand because I could not bear the thought of being touched by him, but with my hand up there I realised I couldn't do that. I found you didn't play games with that man. If he put his hand on you, you didn't want to have your past checked out - although I had nothing to hide. So I wound up holding hands with McCarthy, dying inside. </p> <p>\"The other press men looked at me in horror, with the great man's hand on my shoulder. I said: 'Excuse me, Senator, I got to go to work,' and moved away from him and photographed him and Roy Cohn, who had just been around all the American libraries in Europe throwing out books. When I went down for lunch in the senate dining room, before I could even order my soup, the journalists, about 30 of them, all turned away; nobody would talk to me. So awful was the sense of horror in that room. I could not tell these men why I had done that.\" </p> <p>Arnold has now been taking pictures for almost half a century. Perhaps her best known sequences are the pictures she took of Marilyn Monroe, both early in her career and in 1960 on the set of The Misfits with Monroe's then husband, Arthur Miller. But she is wary of the danger familiar to many a photographer of allowing a famous subject to overshadow a lifetime's work. \"We had great fun together,\" she says of her times with the screen legend. \"But I don't want to be Marilyn's Boswell.\" </p> <p>Arnold got into photography when a boyfriend - or \" beau\" as she calls him - gave her a camera. She took a job with a film processor in Hoboken, New Jersey, and worked there for five years. They would sometimes get a roll of erotic film to be processed, but the law said these could not be sent through the post. So they were locked in a special file and never returned. \"But every now and then,\" she says, \"the boss would drive up in his Cadillac with some friends and ask for the key to the cupboard. Then we could hear them guffawing away in his private office.\" </p> <p>She joined Magnum, the celebrated co-operative photo agency, very early, introduced by the brother of Hungarian war photographer Robert Capa, one of the founding members. </p> <p>Her first great success was a 1952 black fashion show in New York, which was followed by a series on the imperious Marlene Dietrich. She photographed James Cagney at home hoofing with his wife Willy, a former chorus girl. He sang dirty Yiddish ditties for her. (Cagney was Catholic but brought up on New York's East Side.) She did John Huston and his young daughter Angelica, Margot Fonteyn, Rudolph Nureyev and Yves Montand. She did a reportage of a Malcolm X meeting and a series depicting Joan Crawford being dressed by her daughter Christina (who later exposed her in Mommie Dearest). </p> <p>At one point, Crawford, completely drunk, posed nude. Crawford had begun her career in blue films. \"She was a sad, benighted creature,\" Arnold says. \"I never printed the pictures, but I sent her the negatives and that made me her friend for life.\" </p> <p>She travelled the world to get some of the great scoops of the century. She was the first American photographer allowed into China, permitted to travel all over that immense territory almost without restriction. She got her visa, she says, with the help of a Chinese friend the day after Nixon reached his rapprochement with China in 1972. \"The difference between a fine photograph and a good, useable photograph,\" she says, \"might be a gesture, a movement of the hand, a moment's introspection. You don't have time to notice everything.\" </p> <p>In 1966 she had already got the scoop of the decade: a picture of Russian dissidents reclining in baths with motor tyres for pillows, undergoing hydrotherapy intended to cure them of their unorthodox views. How did she get into the psychiatric hospital? She says she works on \"robber's time\", swiftly grabbing shots, often without the subject realising it. </p> <p>\"The previous year,\" she says, \"I had done a fun story in Russia about the oldest man in the world. The Russians were so pleased when I applied again I had no trouble getting a visa. Of course we knew all about the dissidents being held in psychiatric wards. But if I had asked to see them I wouldn't have got in. I said I wanted to see the psychiatrists. At one point the official who was showing me around was called to the phone so I just took a quick shot through a window.\" </p> <p>She talks with passion about the specific details of her art: the virtues of available light (\"By the time you set up lights the image is gone\"); working with colour film (\"With all those colour magazines around in the 70s you couldn't make a living without colour\"); and her beloved Nikon cameras. </p> <p>She speaks of her preference for manual cameras - automatics are, of course, infradig and one does not even bother to acknowledge digital. And she recalls that once in India she had all her Nikons stolen. When she came back to New York, she decided that since she had to replace them she would go high-class and get a load of Leicas (the preferred tool of Cartier-Bresson). \"But when I was going out the door I turned back and said, 'I don't want any of these. I had very good luck with Nikons so I'll stick to them.' \" </p> <p>We get into an argument about colour, which she will not admit is more unreliable than black and white. \"Colour can be treacherous,\" I insist. \"Take, for example, your celebrated picture Black is Beautiful of a beautiful black girl. She wasn't black - she was glowing red.\" </p> <p>\"There are many tones of black,\" she laughs. \"Even red?\" \"Even red,\" she says, this time with steel in her voice. As the Chinese and Russians discovered, Eve Arnold holds her ground. </p> <p>\u0095 Eve Arnold will be the subject of The John Tusa Interview on Radio 3 on Sunday at 5.45pm.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Shares in SmithKline Beecham and Glaxo Wellcome, the pharmaceutical companies set for a \u00a391bn merger, were among the biggest fallers yesterday after their trading statements sent waves of uncertainty through the City. </p> <p>Despite announcing solid results, the pair both admitted to setbacks with the development of important drugs and failed to convince observers their union will be approved this year. </p> <p>The completion of the deal, which will create the world's largest drugs company by market share, is being delayed by US federal trade commission concerns over the combined group's dominant position in the anti-smoking market. Glaxo owns prescription medicine Zyban while SmithKline has interests in nicotine patches and gum. </p> <p>Jean-Pierre Garnier, chief executive of SmithKline, said he hoped the merger would be approved by Christmas without the need for forced sales. \"I am looking at the year end for the merger with Glaxo and the creation of a very important company,\" he said. \"That would be a wonderful Christmas present.\" </p> <p>But analysts were disappointed there was no definite completion date. \"At the moment everyone just wants them to get on with integrating the two business,\" said one. \"There's a risk they won't complete this year and people are worried staff won't know where they are and there will be a lack of direction.\" Glaxo, reporting a nine-month trading update, said sales were up 12% at \u00a36.86bn on a year ago with growth driven by respiratory, central nervous system and anti-viral products. It also hopes NICE, the health authority set up by the NHS, will recommend in a report, expected imminently, that doctors be allowed to prescribe Relenza, its influenza treatment, on the NHS. </p> <p>The company's shares took a battering yesterday over continuing concerns about the side effects of Lotronex, its treatment for irritable bowel syndrome. It also admitted Advair, its new product for asthma, would not be available in the US until the first half of next year. As the market closed last night shares had fallen 84p, or 4%, to \u00a319.84. </p> <p>SmithKline said third quarter pre-tax profits were up 19% to \u00a3589m, excluding currency effects, with strong US sales led by anti-depressant Paxil/ Seroxat. Earnings per share rose 33% to 7.3p while sales in the three months to the end of September stood at \u00a32.19bn, a gain of 17% if currency effects are excluded. </p> <p>However, analysts said the numbers had been inflated by changes to wholesalers' stocking patterns which took the shine off the figures. </p> <p>The company also gave a warning that further tests on Ariflo, its pulmonary disease treatment, had to be carried out which will put its submission to regulators back by up to a year. As a result, SmithKline's shares also lost 4% with the stock tumbling 43p to close the day at 890p. </p> <p>Analysts said the stock market fortunes of the two companies were now inextricably linked. \"Everyone is already treating them as a merged industry,\" said one. \"People are no longer producing separate forecasts.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Shares in SmithKline Beecham and Glaxo Wellcome, the pharmaceutical companies set for a \u00a391bn merger, were among the biggest fallers yesterday after their trading statements sent waves of uncertainty through the City. Despite announcing solid results, the pair both admitted to setbacks with the development of important drugs and failed to convince observers their union will be approved this year. The completion of the deal, which will create the world's largest drugs company by market share, is being delayed by US federal trade commission concerns over the combined group's dominant position in the anti-smoking market. Glaxo owns prescription medicine Zyban while SmithKline has interests in nicotine patches and gum. Jean-Pierre Garnier, chief executive of SmithKline, said he hoped the merger would be approved by Christmas without the need for forced sales. \"I am looking at the year end for the merger with Glaxo and the creation of a very important company,\" he said. \"That would be a wonderful Christmas present.\" But analysts were disappointed there was no definite completion date. \"At the moment everyone just wants them to get on with integrating the two business,\" said one. \"There's a risk they won't complete this year and people are worried staff won't know where they are and there will be a lack of direction.\" Glaxo, reporting a nine-month trading update, said sales were up 12% at \u00a36.86bn on a year ago with growth driven by respiratory, central nervous system and anti-viral products. It also hopes NICE, the health authority set up by the NHS, will recommend in a report, expected imminently, that doctors be allowed to prescribe Relenza, its influenza treatment, on the NHS. The company's shares took a battering yesterday over continuing concerns about the side effects of Lotronex, its treatment for irritable bowel syndrome. It also admitted Advair, its new product for asthma, would not be available in the US until the first half of next year. As the market closed last night shares had fallen 84p, or 4%, to \u00a319.84. SmithKline said third quarter pre-tax profits were up 19% to \u00a3589m, excluding currency effects, with strong US sales led by anti-depressant Paxil/ Seroxat. Earnings per share rose 33% to 7.3p while sales in the three months to the end of September stood at \u00a32.19bn, a gain of 17% if currency effects are excluded. However, analysts said the numbers had been inflated by changes to wholesalers' stocking patterns which took the shine off the figures. The company also gave a warning that further tests on Ariflo, its pulmonary disease treatment, had to be carried out which will put its submission to regulators back by up to a year. As a result, SmithKline's shares also lost 4% with the stock tumbling 43p to close the day at 890p. Analysts said the stock market fortunes of the two companies were now inextricably linked. \"Everyone is already treating them as a merged industry,\" said one. \"People are no longer producing separate forecasts.\"",

For though the identity of the goalscorers had a familiar ring, this was a line-up that owed more to tomorrow's United than today's. </p> <p>Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Dwight Yorke lent some know-how to Sir Alex Ferguson's young set and it was they who made sure that a tie eagerly awaited by the Watford public would become no more than a routine passage to the next round.</p> <p>Such was Watford's embarrassment at the disparity in class that Tommy Mooney even missed a late penalty awarded for a foul by Raimond van der Gouw, who was shown the red card.</p> <p>It was lamentable the way a team unbeaten in the First Division failed to impose themselves, but even Graham Taylor seemed taken aback by the quality on view. \"If that was United's second team or third or fourth it still looks good enough to finish in the top six in the Premiership,\" he said.</p> <p>United's opener arrived after 12 minutes and though Solskjaer was credited with it the donkey-work was done by Ronnie Wallwork, whose strong challenge took the ball away from Paul Robinson and set up Luke Chadwick for a shot which Alec Chamberlain could only parry.</p> <p>Chadwick continued to be centrally involved, gliding effortlessly away from defenders before sending over crosses such as the one that gave Yorke the second goal eight minutes after half-time. How painful for Watford to see Chadwick dazzling so; he was signed by them as a schoolboy but, Taylor said, it is impossible to keep richly endowed youngsters at a small club.</p> <p>Wes Brown had a run-out for United as he needs games to build up his fitness and education, and his partnership with John O'Shea offered little encouragement to the opposition. Wallwork and Jonathan Greening got through a hard shift in midfield and offered both strength and skill to a team effort rounded off nine minutes from time when Solskjaer capitalised on a long clearance.</p> <p>\"We knew these lads had the ability, it's a question of whether they also have the confidence to express themselves and I was delighted to see them do so well on a big stage.\"</p> <p>So said Steve McLaren, the United assistant manager and with a leading part to play now in the development of the national team. He can reassure Sven-Goran Eriksson that there is a generation behind David Beckham showing equal promise. </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "bodyText": "The best that the First Division currently has to offer were no match for half a Premiership team last night. For though the identity of the goalscorers had a familiar ring, this was a line-up that owed more to tomorrow's United than today's. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Dwight Yorke lent some know-how to Sir Alex Ferguson's young set and it was they who made sure that a tie eagerly awaited by the Watford public would become no more than a routine passage to the next round. Such was Watford's embarrassment at the disparity in class that Tommy Mooney even missed a late penalty awarded for a foul by Raimond van der Gouw, who was shown the red card. It was lamentable the way a team unbeaten in the First Division failed to impose themselves, but even Graham Taylor seemed taken aback by the quality on view. \"If that was United's second team or third or fourth it still looks good enough to finish in the top six in the Premiership,\" he said. United's opener arrived after 12 minutes and though Solskjaer was credited with it the donkey-work was done by Ronnie Wallwork, whose strong challenge took the ball away from Paul Robinson and set up Luke Chadwick for a shot which Alec Chamberlain could only parry. Chadwick continued to be centrally involved, gliding effortlessly away from defenders before sending over crosses such as the one that gave Yorke the second goal eight minutes after half-time. How painful for Watford to see Chadwick dazzling so; he was signed by them as a schoolboy but, Taylor said, it is impossible to keep richly endowed youngsters at a small club. Wes Brown had a run-out for United as he needs games to build up his fitness and education, and his partnership with John O'Shea offered little encouragement to the opposition. Wallwork and Jonathan Greening got through a hard shift in midfield and offered both strength and skill to a team effort rounded off nine minutes from time when Solskjaer capitalised on a long clearance. \"We knew these lads had the ability, it's a question of whether they also have the confidence to express themselves and I was delighted to see them do so well on a big stage.\" So said Steve McLaren, the United assistant manager and with a leading part to play now in the development of the national team. He can reassure Sven-Goran Eriksson that there is a generation behind David Beckham showing equal promise. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It wasn't only the teenagers joining Cambridge's youth participation scheme who were apprehensive about the new venture giving them a voice in decision-taking. So were local councillors - and not just about how realistic the young people would be. </p> <p>Hannah Reed, one of the councillors, confessed: \"I'm 31 but I was nervous about being able to talk their language. I soon learned that by being yourself and not trying to act younger than you are, young people are ready to be straight with you.\" </p> <p>The success of the initiative was rewarded today when the city of Cambridge was named overall winner of the Guardian/Institute for Public Policy Research Public Involvement Award. </p> <p>Young people are one of the biggest excluded groups. Cambridge calculated under 18s represented 17 % of the city's population but, unlike other people, they did not even have a vote. There was cross-party support for getting them more involved in decision-taking. The council decided the best way forward was to let the young people work out what ought to be on the agenda. A three-stage exercise was launched that eventually involved more than 1,150 young people being invited to \"shoot your mouth off\". </p> <p>Stage one involved a survey of 700 young people through street interviews and a survey at four secondary schools. They were asked to identify three key issues. </p> <p>In stage two a grand jury of 40 young people then thrashed out these ideas at two half-day seminars. What emerged were two key priorities: first drugs, alcohol and crime; second \"more things to do in Cambridge\". The second was seen to be part of the solution to the first. </p> <p>Stage three was a much longer process in which a jury of 15 young people, trained on how to interview witnesses, were taken on two fact-finding missions to other towns as well as interviews with key Cambridge councillors, officials and leisure service managers. </p> <p>This was followed by four half-day jury sessions before written and oral reports were presented to council. What has followed has been impressive. The council responded to each of the 32 proposals and have taken up a significant proportion. </p> <p>These included a fare reduction on city buses for young people; a youth bus complete with computers, video games and youth workers making weekly visits to areas with few facilities; a free one-day summer party for 11 to 17-year-olds, which more than 2,000 attended; a new discount leisure card, designed by young people; a cyber cafe in the city centre for 16 Saturdays; and a review of council premises to see if more use could be made of them for young people's activities. </p> <p>More impressive still, the participation programme remains ongoing. All are invited to join in. A further 200 have enrolled. The city now has biannual youth conferences - this year's second was held last Saturday. The summer party has become an annual event. Four action groups have been set up dealing with transport, crime and disorder, and cycling. </p> <p>Andy Barnard, who served on both the grand jury and the 15-member policy jury, was only 14 when he became involved. \"I felt apprehensive at first but once the 15-member jury went away for a weekend together, real trust was established. We weren't patronised by the older members. We really bonded. It has given me much more confidence. I was even able to address 500 people from the city party platform. The council has listened and is moving on our agenda. The main aim now must be to widen participation.\" </p> <p>Reed feels equally rewarded. She explains: \"Young people are refreshing to work with. They're dead straight and honest. They ask much more direct questions than adults. Moreover, they were really realistic in their demands. They recognised the only way to proceed was to start with modest proposals then build on that. There are lessons here for all councils.\" </p> <p>While Cambridge was the overall winner, there were plenty more success stories. New means of involving the public - including the most mar ginal of groups - in key decisions that affect their lives emerged across the country. There was a citizen's jury of 16 drug addicts who helped develop a new strategy for detoxification and rehabilitation services for Big Issue vendors; there was a citizens' advisory group in Milton Keynes that is leading to extra permanent sites for travellers. </p> <p>In a crowded entry list, local councils were ahead of all other public, private and voluntary organisations. </p> <p>Dr Mo Mowlam, minister for the Cabinet Office, said at the awards ceremony in London that government needed to work with all interested parties in developing policies and services including front line staff. She added: \"That is the way we will develop the best policy, the best legislation and the best services. It is also the way to develop trust in the system of government.\" </p> <p>\"This is why the Guardian/IPPR awards are important. They will encourage government and other organisations that provide a public service to raise their game in finding new, effective ways of involving people. I hope today's ceremony will be the first of many.\" </p> <p>Matthew Taylor, director of the IPPR, said involving people in decision-taking had \"moved from the margin to the mainstream\". Public involvement was \"difficult and time consuming and sometimes expensive\" but produced better decisions for a wide variety of organisations. One aim of the scheme was to highlight out-standing initiatives with the hope that best practice could spread. </p> <p>He added: \"Sceptics claim that public participation risks heightening public expectations. Experience shows the public are realistic, and are willing and able to take part in decisions that affect their lives.\" </p> <p>One reason for the success of local councils is the government's \"best value\" programme that requires local councils to consult the communities they serve. The criteria selected by the 14-member judging panel required applicants to demonstrate more than just consultation. They had to demonstrate that something else had hap pened as a result: a change in service delivery, a shift in policy, or reform of the organisation's structure to give the public more say. More points were awarded for innovative approaches, sustainable strategies and schemes involving hard-to-reach groups. </p> <p>The 161 applicants included three community health groups, three police services, four primary care groups, six housing associations, seven private companies, eight health authorities or trusts, 13 charities, 50 voluntary or community organisations and 62 councils. </p> <p>The judges found charities were effective in organising questionnaires and focus groups but failed to go beyond these traditional techniques. Many voluntary organisations were using good community development techniques to keep in touch with users or client groups, but it was not always clear how these consultations led to a change of agenda. The private sector submitted seven schemes involving public consultation but there was insufficient evidence that the exercises had clearly changed decisions. </p> <p><strong>Reward for hard work</strong><br></p> <p><strong>The other award winners and what their projects achieved:</strong><br></p> <p> A campaign to help fight drug addiction and a city's help with the traveller community were two of the other outstanding Public Involvement Awards winners. </p> <p>The Big Issue in the North Trust, one of the six other award winners, tackled drug addicts. They selected a citizen's jury of 16 addicts, all working as vendors of the Big Issue. Twelve were taking heroin, seven crack and four cocaine. They were brought together for seven days, the first two to get to know each other and the next five to draw up a strategy for detoxification and rehabilitation services. Evidence was taken over two days from 11 expert witnesses including Mike Trace, the deputy drug tsar, Professor Howard Parker of Manchester University, senior drug police officers and specialist doctors. </p> <p>Their final report helped the trust to develop its own drug service for its vendors, many of whom have drug problems. The pilot, which runs until next year, has included buying bed places at Phoenix House, a charitable detoxification centre, and developing a follow-through residential and rehabilitation service. The report was submitted to the North West drugs commission and, on the advice of Paul Boateng, the Home Office minister whom the jury met, to all other relevant ministers. </p> <p>The Milton Keynes citizens' advisory group on travellers tackled an equally controversial group. Even while they were preparing their report, a disruptive group of travellers hit the local headlines when they turned up at one of the new town's two sites and began intimidating regular users. A caravan was set alight. </p> <p>Yet the group has succeeded in defusing the situation with a package that includes stronger action against unacceptable traveller behaviour and more tolerance of traveller families following a local code of conduct. The advisory group emerged from a multi-agency partnership (council, police and two major local landlords, Milton Keynes Park Trust and the Commission for New Towns). </p> <p>The partnership sent out questionnaires to 800 randomly selected local residents seeking views on travellers. About 180 were returned with 60 ready to join a citizens' jury. These were all invited but only 21 turned up. They renamed themselves an advisory group, believing the name jury to be too confrontational and divisive. The group held two public meetings and consulted in depth with landowners, travellers, residents, police, councillors and officials. </p> <p>The main recommendations have been accepted. A new traveller management unit to co-ordinate all operational aspects is up and running. The new tough and tender management proposals have been introduced. A recommendation for extra permanent sites (the existing two can only accommodate about 12 families) prompted a search by the partnership which identified four possible locations. Finally, the group has helped consolidate political support. A recent move in the council to abandon the idea of new sites was overwhelmingly defeated. </p> <p>Many councils have established panels of residents for consultation purposes, but few are as flexible or as extensive as the London borough of Lewisham's<strong> </strong> 1,000-member panel. The members like it too: 96% of members expressed satisfaction. More than 20 consultation exercises have been conducted involving telephone surveys, focus groups and community workshops. </p> <p> <strong> Overall winner</strong><br> </p> <p> \u0095 Cambridge city council </p> <p><strong> Other winners</strong><br> </p> <p> \u0095 The Big Issue in the North Trust </p> <p> \u0095 Milton Keynes partnership - council, Thames Valley police, English Partnerships, and Milton Keynes Parks Trust </p> <p> \u0095 London borough of Lewisham </p> <p>\u0095 Bristol city council's action research on parental involvement in schools and lifelong learning; </p> <p>\u0095 South Ayrshire's use of people with learning difficulties and their carers in developing a learning disability strategy; </p> <p>\u0095 Trafford South primary care group's consultation exercises used to review health and social care services. </p> <p> <strong> Runners-up</strong><br> </p> <p> \u0095 Gloucester city and Gloucester county council for road safety consultations; </p> <p>\u0095 Portsmouth county council for its public consultation strategy; </p> <p>\u0095 Somerset health authority for its consultation panels on GP services, NHS direct and priority setting; </p> <p>\u0095 Swansea county council for its youth forum; </p> <p>\u0095 Walsall council for its community plan. </p>",

You will support him and any decisions he makes. It is as if the Football Association had chosen the 52-year-old Lazio coach for his image rather than his skills. Look at his attributes: deep tan, tidy hair, controlled sophistication. It's a complete volte-face from the England team's experience: a man who thinks about how he looks, and knows his style has the power to draw you in. </p> <p>But look again. Aren't his glasses a little odd? Try to imagine his face without them and you would be clutching at straws for a memorable feature. But there is something not quite right about those specs and they are insidiously fascinating. They are rimless, usually a style which renders glasses invisible, thanks to their thin metal frames (think Arsene Wenger, then look at the picture, since you probably can't remember much about the Arsenal boss's eyewear). But this pair, designed byItalian house Ext\u00e9, are blatant, meaning-laden creations, with their strange plastic bridge and sides. </p> <p>\"They're very unusual,\" says Gail Steele, of the London opticians Auerbach and Steele. \"Most rimless glasses have a metal bridge and side. He still wants his glasses to be a feature. He has made a conscious decision to contradict his colouring, with the dull blue of the plastic against his skin. In my view they are quite ugly.\" </p> <p>Ugly, yes, but effective. Rimless specs, popular with elder statesmen of European politics, send out signals of openness and honesty. Glasses with frames hide features and so can camouflage expressions - the wearer can end up looking shifty, even if they think they have nothing to hide. Rimless frames let you see the reactions of the person behind them, but they can also be almost too Zen: mild functional things that sit on the nose of a philosopher, not disturbing their thoughts. </p> <p>Eriksson's glasses stand halfway between the two - modern and forward-thinking, if you were to look him dead in the eye, but from the side we see power and control, a man who wants to remain an old-style boss. \"He's going for the mixed message,\" says Steele. \"The soft guy and the tough guy at the same time.\" </p> <p>Eriksson has only recently adopted this new, \u00fcber -leader, style. When he joined Lazio in 1997, his round, meek metal rims made him look uncomplicated and concerned. His new look, coinciding with his success with the Rome side, leading the team to the Italian double, completely changed the way he was perceived. \"Changing glasses is the only way most people can dramatically change their look,\" says Steele. \"The only equivalent is having all your hair cut off. It does change how people perceive you - even though they are strange, he looks switched on, modern, and ready to motivate people.\" </p> <p>Football in this country has seen rimless specs before and, even more threatening to the old-fashioned supporter, has seen them European coaches. There is Wenger at Arsenal and G\u00e9rard Houllier at Liverpool, both of whom wear traditional rimless styles that melt into the face, revealing the inner manager. But there has never been an England coach with rimless specs, and never before a European manager with rimless specs in charge of the national team. It is probably just the sort of style earthquake that prompted the traditionalist Jack Charlton to say: \"I am very, very upset and I would imagine all the boys I played with in the 1966 World Cup winning team would be too.\" </p> <p>For England fans who have known all along that a foreign coach was the only way forward, the image of Eriksson offers hope. Until he officially takes over on July 1 next 2001, we can trust in the knowledge that the Swede will have no time for the laziness and excuses of our recent past. We can picture the national side as if they were Lazio mark II - young, dynamic, fit, even though we know Eriksson can only import his training secrets, not his players. </p> <p>But think forward, to February 2002. Regardless of the results of his team, Eriksson will have had to endure England and all we can throw at him. He will be exhausted by criticism and the expectation of the country. His tan will have disappeared and his skin will look tired and sad, unable to cope with 90 minutes spent trying not to be blown into the dugout by gales. His handmade Italian suits will be battered and puckered by rain, hail and flying missiles. He may well realise that his bright, breezy spectacles are giving too much away, that he needs to hide from the stresses of the job. Maybe there was some thought behind Graham Taylor's big, round-framed glasses after all.</p>",

      "bodyText": "West Ham booked their place in the fourth round with a 2-0 win over Blackburn at Upton Park. The Croatian striker Davor Suker broke the deadlock just after the hour mark when he hit a left-foot volley after Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Kanout\u00e9 headed on a Paolo di Canio corner. And Di Canio made sure of the result six minutes from time, netting the rebound from his own retaken spot-kick. Although Rovers left out a clutter of first-teamers and blooded the youngsters Darren Dunning and Marc Richards, in midfield and up front respectively, their Premiership hosts fielded a virtual first-choice side. Graeme Souness, denied the services of the cup-tied Mark Hughes, also chose to rest Craig Short, Craig Hignett and Henning Berg. The Hammers will face either Sheffield Wednesday or Sheffield United in the next round. Sunderland were pushed all the way by plucky Bristol Rovers at the Memorial Ground, with Don Hutchison grabbing the winner two minutes from time. The Scottish midfielder had also put the Black Cats ahead three minutes into the second half. Nathan Ellington got the home side back on level terms just after the hour only for Hutchison to have the final say as a 2-1 win set up a clash with Manchester United in the fourth round. \u0095Tony Cottee looks set to be named as player-manager of Third Division Barnet today. The veteran striker has had his contract at Norwich City terminated by mutual consent. \"I have been offered a player-management position and that is something which is right for me and something that I have wanted to do for the past three seasons,\" Cottee said. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

The credit card provider is writing to its one million-plus customers, inviting them to join the NHS Organ Donor Register and, from January 2001, apply for a new card with the donor symbol on it. The move, which has the backing of the National Health System, aims to increase the number of people willing to donate organs and solve the country's chronic shortage. At present, over 6,000 people need organ transplants, but only around 3,000 operations take place every year, principally because of the organ shortage and because relatives do not know if the deceased would have wanted to be a donor. Given that a credit card is one of the few items most people carry with them at all times, having a donor symbol on them is thought to be an ideal way of letting people know they wish to be a donor. However, Goldfish also hopes to win new credit card customers by aligning itself with a worthy cause and, as such, the initiative is just the latest in a long line of charitable initiatives from financial service providers. In fact, today sees the launch of two other such initiatives.

      "trailText": "<p>A secretive new army of consultants is about to arrive from the US. Their mission: to help keep restless British workers in check.  Diane Taylor enters the shadowy world of the union-busters.</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The scene could be a call centre, a factory, a supermarket. The first signs of their presence in the workplace seem innocuous - comical even. There are the cutesy baseball caps bearing propagandising slogans, the gaudy leaflets, the \"informative\" videos made compulsory viewing for all staff and subtly peddling their message. There might - as happened at one major manufacturer in the US in recent months - be time off work for a company picnic, a lavish, feelgood away-day featuring speeches and presentations that seem to be slanted in a certain direction. </p> <p>And then come the more sinister aspects: the hints that employees are being surreptitiously filmed at work; the workers \"let go\" in mysterious circumstances; the strangers at out-of-work gatherings pretending to be people they're not. By then, it should be clear: the union-busters - consul tants hired by employers to help them avoid or frustrate plans to organise unions in the workplace - have arrived. Their message to staff: organising a union would see salaries go into freefall and competitiveness take a battering, throwing the very survival of their company into doubt. </p> <p>There are an estimated 10,000 anti-union consultants in the United States, many attached to law firms - and they are on their way to Britain. Demand for their services in this country is booming thanks to new employment legislation making it easier for unions to win recognition. Their pitch plays on the paranoia of senior managers, summoning images of the most notorious instances of union might: the winter of discontent, the miners' strike. And the first such company to cross the Atlantic, PTI Labor Research, is due to open an office in London any day now. </p> <p>A specific date is a little harder to come by, since PTI, based in Houston, Texas, proves reluctant to return telephone calls, and certainly doesn't seem to be planning an all-singing, all-dancing opening ceremony. \"The opening of PTI's London office hasn't officially been announced yet,\" a spokeswoman finally reveals, \"but we'll know more in the next month or so.\" </p> <p>It is just five months since the 1999 Employment Relations Act came into force, setting out regulations aimed at reintroducing compulsory procedures for union recognition for the first time since the 1980s. The new laws mean that recognition must follow if 40% of the relevant segment of a workforce votes in favour. Where union recognition laws are strongest, the consultants calculate, new business will be easiest to come by. </p> <p>PTI's website gives few indications of how its British operation will function, explaining only that the company is already \"advising UK companies on strategies for remaining union-free_ Due to the sensitive nature of our business, we ask that you contact us for further information\". PTI partner Stuart Keene is understood to be in London for the forthcoming launch, but he can only be contacted through the Texas headquarters. Even there, he is not returning calls. </p> <p>The firm has already been outlining its strategies to British managers.

      "bodyText": "The scene could be a call centre, a factory, a supermarket. The first signs of their presence in the workplace seem innocuous - comical even. There are the cutesy baseball caps bearing propagandising slogans, the gaudy leaflets, the \"informative\" videos made compulsory viewing for all staff and subtly peddling their message. There might - as happened at one major manufacturer in the US in recent months - be time off work for a company picnic, a lavish, feelgood away-day featuring speeches and presentations that seem to be slanted in a certain direction. And then come the more sinister aspects: the hints that employees are being surreptitiously filmed at work; the workers \"let go\" in mysterious circumstances; the strangers at out-of-work gatherings pretending to be people they're not. By then, it should be clear: the union-busters - consul tants hired by employers to help them avoid or frustrate plans to organise unions in the workplace - have arrived. Their message to staff: organising a union would see salaries go into freefall and competitiveness take a battering, throwing the very survival of their company into doubt. There are an estimated 10,000 anti-union consultants in the United States, many attached to law firms - and they are on their way to Britain. Demand for their services in this country is booming thanks to new employment legislation making it easier for unions to win recognition. Their pitch plays on the paranoia of senior managers, summoning images of the most notorious instances of union might: the winter of discontent, the miners' strike. And the first such company to cross the Atlantic, PTI Labor Research, is due to open an office in London any day now. A specific date is a little harder to come by, since PTI, based in Houston, Texas, proves reluctant to return telephone calls, and certainly doesn't seem to be planning an all-singing, all-dancing opening ceremony. \"The opening of PTI's London office hasn't officially been announced yet,\" a spokeswoman finally reveals, \"but we'll know more in the next month or so.\" It is just five months since the 1999 Employment Relations Act came into force, setting out regulations aimed at reintroducing compulsory procedures for union recognition for the first time since the 1980s. The new laws mean that recognition must follow if 40% of the relevant segment of a workforce votes in favour. Where union recognition laws are strongest, the consultants calculate, new business will be easiest to come by. PTI's website gives few indications of how its British operation will function, explaining only that the company is already \"advising UK companies on strategies for remaining union-free_ Due to the sensitive nature of our business, we ask that you contact us for further information\". PTI partner Stuart Keene is understood to be in London for the forthcoming launch, but he can only be contacted through the Texas headquarters. Even there, he is not returning calls. The firm has already been outlining its strategies to British managers. At a conference on employment law earlier this year organised by the UK law firm Eversheds, a PTI representative spoke on anti-union strategies before numerous employers, believed to include McDonald's, Gap and Tower Records. (Eversheds partner Roger Steel is anxious to distance his company from PTI, arguing, \"If PTI did introduce the same tactics over here as they employ in the US, it would misjudge the mood.\") A leading anti-union law firm, Jackson Lewis Schnitzler and Krugman, which counts the US-based bookstore giant Borders among past clients, is also understood to be advising British businesses. In the US, Borders has been repeatedly involved in controversy for its anti-union campaigns, threatening to shut down bookshops where staff vote for recognition. The union-busters will bring two decades of US experience to exploiting loopholes in the new British employment law, warns Carolyn Jones of the Institute for Employment Rights. \"During the consultation period, we urged the government to adopt the European model of union recognition, which does more to safeguard workers' rights,\" she says. \"We said, 'If you're really serious about strengthening unions and collective bargaining, don't go for laws based on the American system.' But they did.\" Employers who panic at the prospect of union organisation can end up in self-defeating dead ends, says Kate Bronfenbenner, an expert on employment relations at Cornell University in New York state. \"Sometimes a company which is barely solvent will end up paying tens of thousands of dollars to a union-buster - far more than it would ever have cost to negotiate with the union for better terms and conditions for staff,\" she says. \"Union-busters see a good business opportunity in the UK: they're telling British employers that the unions will destroy their businesses, and that they are the one group of people who can protect them.\" But the Trades Union Congress, having previously undertaken confidential investigations into the consultants' activities, now argues that British workplace culture will prove profoundly antipathetic to the American import. \"Making it compulsory to wear a baseball cap won't go down well over here,\" a spokesman says firmly. \"In fact, companies like PTI could be handing unions the best recruitment tool they've ever been given.

Universal Ballet may be based in Seoul, but during the company's brief and bizarre history (it was founded in 1984 by the Rev Sun Myung Moon as a showcase for his dead son's fiancee, the dancer Julia H Moon) it has absorbed an international variety of influences. Its core of Asian dancers has been supplemented by Russians and Americans, and its current director is Oleg Vinogradov, who was for more than 20 years director of the Kirov. </p> <p>It is thus not a purely Korean Giselle which is up for discussion, rather a non-British one. In the UK we like our dancers to act as an ensemble - remaining in character even when they aren't centre stage and aiming for the kind of collective spontaneity that allows us to believe the ballet is unfolding here and now, rather than being a nightly ritual. The members of Universal Ballet, whose acting is perfunctory and expression highly stylised, don't even attempt a realistic telling of the story, which is why much of the first act, with its village gaiety and its growing tensions between Giselle's two suitors, seems cardboard. </p> <p>Yet in the more abstract second act, the startling discipline of the company's corps de ballet and its shimmering fusion of Russian and Asian lyricism makes us sit up and take notice. The eerie symmetries of the Wilis' dancing, the cobwebs in which they trap duplicitous men, are so finely drawn that the dancers look as if they have graduated from one of the old European schools. At their centre is Julia Moon, who absolutely ranks as a major Giselle. </p> <p>The delicate impassivity of Moon's face in the first act is disconcerting - she seems like a Giselle from a Noh play - and this certainly doesn't help the overall stiltedness of the company's acting. Yet from the moment she starts dancing there is such a febrile interplay of nuance and rhythm in her body that we sense rather than see how fatally her passion for Albrecht is intensifying and how inevitably it will rip her apart. In the second act, though a foot injury may account for some slight lethargy in Moon's jumping, the eloquence of her phrasing and the airborne lightness of her arms make her seem transparent.

For his debut solo disc, Keating shrewdly recruited grizzled old songwriting veterans such as Diane Warren, Bryan Adams and Pat Leonard to supply some ballast, and tunes such as Life Is a Rollercoaster and When You Say Nothing At All have that air of predestination about them that only the practised pop hack can supply. During the encores, Ronan plugged into his Irish roots by duetting with Maire Brennan on Fairy Tale of New York and rocking out (albeit cautiously) on Whiskey in the Jar. For a finale he delivered the ponderous The Long Goodbye. He co-wrote it with Paul Brady, but it might easily have been churned out by a software program designed to clone adult-orientated megaballads. Ronan has already grabbed the daughters.

After the trailer for the forthcoming The Killer Tomatoes, it's on to the main feature, The Phantom Gobstopper, a 1901 silent horror classic by Gunter Von Earwig. Things take a turn for the terrifying when the film starts to go wrong. Gloria the popcorn-fixated usherette steps through the screen, and a 19th-century factory worker, possessed by a restless, tormented spirit from beyond the grave, steps out. </p> <p>The first 10 minutes of this collaboration between Forkbeard Fantasy, whose surreal and dotty attempts to mix film and theatre began long before such ideas were fashionable, and writer Sean Aita, is so funny, spooky and inventive that the show seemed destined to become a theatre classic for family audiences. Unfortunately, the first 10 minutes is as good as it gets in an evening that turns into a cross between RL Stine's Goosebumps series and a lecture on the power of the imagination and storytelling. </p> <p>Aita mines a good comedy-horror vein, with plenty of groan-creating moments of the \"There's no 'arm in it\" variety when a character appears to lose a limb. Throughout, the special effects and the giant puppets have a brilliant over-the-top tackiness. There is beauty too: at one magical moment a miniature ship appears to float across the stage as if in the dream of a dying man. </p> <p>But for all its visual appeal, the show is let down by writing that's never sharp enough to be a spoof on the appalling writing of the horror genre, and it lacks any depth or subtext. Audibility is also sometimes a problem. For such a simple story, in which the powers of evil must be defeated by recalling a story from childhood, coherence is an unexpected problem, and the audience participation is much too childish for an audience that is more sophisticated and more open to real substance than perhaps Aita realises. </p> <p>The cast perform with larky high spirits and, as ever, Forkbeard Fantasy amaze with the clever way they operate at the interface of theatre and film. But while this is good fun, it is not nearly fun enough to turn young people on to theatre. </p> <p>\u0095 Until Saturday. Box office: 020-8858 7755.</p>",

      "body": "<p>In the three years since it first appeared, Patrick Marber's viciously funny play has become a modern classic, picking up a batch of awards while continuing to shock audiences with its candid look at lust and infidelity. Chris Honer's sharp production features a post-industrial set of pillars and slats that looks like the downstairs bar in the now-defunct Hacienda down the road. Indeed, this is theatre for the clubbing generation, and the between-set music and video graphics would work as well in any chill-out room. This streetwise edge may give the play a young urban credibility, but the strength of the writing is such that the context is not as important as it first seems. Even the hilarious internet-sex scene feels timeless. </p> <p>Marber's lines have all the urgency and spit of a stand-up routine, but allied to this fervour is a deep awareness of how people relate to each other. Closer is all about people coming together and coming apart, and we see the often desperate first meetings and always desperate endings of all four characters' relationships. Emma Cleasby catches nicely the childlike sarcasm and sneer of Alice, the play's siren and cipher, \"the belle of the bullshit\", who undergoes more transformations than any other character: from street-kid casual to evening-gown elegance to gold-lam\u00e9 lap-dancer and pyjama-clad girl. Perhaps, though, Cleasby's delivery is a little muffled beneath Alice's shifting insecurities. </p> <p>Closer asks if love is anything more than narcissism and the need for reassurance. And when you consider the men in the play you would have to say no. Julian Protheroe, as obituary writer Dan, gives a fine performance, at first all clean heels and assertiveness but soon reduced to blubbering and hitting out. </p> <p>As the quartet's love lives become ever more despairing and entangled, the power oscillates between the needy and the needed until you're not too sure who's manipulating who. Christian Burgess is excellent as the suave doctor, Larry, whose insecurity is easily piqued, while Julie Riley is equally assured as the sophisticated Anna, perhaps the only character not to unravel altogether . By the end of the play, you're sure to feel exhausted, enlightened and a little relieved. But then breaking up is hard to do. </p> <p>Until November 25. Box office: 0161-236 7110.</p>",
