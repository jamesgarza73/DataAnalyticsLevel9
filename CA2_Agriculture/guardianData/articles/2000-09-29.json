That and a number of other reasons that have an all-too-familiar ring. </p> <p>Collymore's playing career has been accompanied by metronomic mood swings that appear to take their cue from whether or not he is in the first team, his relationships with whoever happens to be employing him at the time, the likelihood of a move elsewhere and, not least, the state of his cashflow. </p> <p>According to Taylor, Collymore's attitude at Filbert Street changed when Leicester refused to pay him more than the basic \u00a314,000-a-week plus \u00a36,000 appearance money he was reported to be earning after joining them from Aston Villa in February. </p> <p>Taylor claimed Collymore had put on a stone since pre-season training and after Leicester's disappointing 1-1 draw with Everton on Sunday, when a win would have put them on top of the Premiership, told the striker that his performance after coming off the bench had been unacceptable. </p> <p>At first it seemed Collymore's present contract would be cancelled; in other words he would be sacked. But then, as Taylor explained, the people behind the player insisted that he be put on the transfer list and, since performing indifferently is not a sufficient reason for a footballer to be fired, this is what has happened. </p> <p>So Collymore will continue to struggle by on his salary at Filbert Street until the next manager of his next club decides that a few goals are worth the bother of taking on Stan and his complexes.

Good luck to Stan and all who fail with him. But surely it is a depressing comment on the increasing power wielded by footballers and their agents that such consistent under-achievement should thrive so profitably. </p> <p>Few of Collymore's moves have been totally lacking in acrimony. In the summer of 1995, after scoring 23 goals in 37 league games for Nottingham Forest, he joined Liverpool for \u00a38.5m having exasperated Frank Clark, the Forest manager, with his unpredictable temperament. </p> <p>Once at Anfield he started criticising the then Liverpool manager Roy Evans for not reorganising the team to suit his talents. An apology from the player followed but the relationship remained strained. Collymore refused to move closer to Merseyside from his Staffordshire home in Cannock and Liverpool fined the striker \u00a320,000 for failing to turn up for a reserve game at Tranmere Rovers. </p> <p>When Liverpool sold Collymore to Villa for \u00a37m it was regarded by some as the sell of the century. Brian Little, then the Villa manager, felt he understood Stan. Stan said he would love to finish his career at Villa but that nobody could look into a crystal ball. </p> <p>Unsurprisingly, this turned out to be balls of the non-crystal kind. Collymore's career at Villa ended with his entering a clinic for stress problems after he had walked out on learning he was not in team for an FA Cup-tie against Fulham, a match that Villa lost. </p> <p>John Gregory, who by then had taken over from Little, was sympathetic but bemused. It was reported that he had been ready to put Collymore on the transfer list at \u00a32m and fine him two weeks' wages. Instead Collymore joined Leicester for \u00a3500,000 on an 18-month contract. </p> <p>Now Collymore says he wants regular first-team football in order to win back a place in the England squad. In reality a fourth cap for Stan is about as likely as Kevin Keegan picking Derek Dooley. </p> <p>\"I want to sort my future out,\" was this week's cry from the heart of a 29-year-old striker the pattern of whose recent past may have already decided his future. This has less to do with his unfortunate history of slapping women around or letting off fire extinguishers in hotel bars than the uncertainty of mood as a player that must, by now, outweigh his diminished goalscoring potential. </p> <p>Modern football often demands more from a player off the ball than when he is in possession. The ever- increasing speed of the game and the need to create space through runs, checks, decoys and so on means that no side can afford men who believe they can also serve by standing and waiting. </p> <p>A fortnight ago Collymore came off the bench at Stamford Bridge to complete Leicester's 2-0 win against Chelsea with a well-timed dash into the goalmouth to meet Steve Guppy's centre.

And that's in a love song. </p> <p>Lloyd Webber should be thrilled. His turgid, sentimental and derivative tunes (odd how they all have such familiarity the first time you hear them) have at last been hitched to a worthwhile plot and set of lyrics. Moreover, thanks to Elton, his Lordship has achieved the most unlikely of triumphs: this is a production that makes football work on stage. And that is thanks not only to the earthy lyrics and the excellent choreography mixing football moves with ballet (sadly, there is no mention of Dennis Wise as a consultant). It is down to the fact that Elton has resisted all temptation to make triumph in sport result in success in life. </p> <p>The problems of trying to capture the drama of sport in an imaginative context are generally summed up by the phrase Escape to Victory.

And indeed, even as Jim found the net, his mother found true love, his coach found new purpose and his school found lottery funding for a new sports hall. Though to be fair, the final frame was of Jimmy landing a contract with Manchester City, so not everything in the garden was rosy. </p> <p>Ben Elton, though, is too wise a bird to fall for this. Instead of trying to replicate the drama of sport in his plot with last-gasp winners and penalties scored by unlikely heroes, the football is almost incidental to his tale. In the Beautiful Game, the football is not a metaphor for life, just a part of it. In Elton's story, set in Northern Ireland at the start of the Troubles, his team do indeed win the cup, but it happens early in the first half of the show. It is a success - carefree and innocent - which casts a poignant pall over the rest of the plot, as the team members embroil themselves in sectarianism. The message is: if only life could be as simple as football. </p> <p>It is a pity Elton's insight is not more widely shared. Particularly down under. The way Cathy Freeman's victory in the 400m was received in Australia suggested that far too many observers were confused into thinking they were watching a film. Her victory, apparently, will right a million wrongs, resolve a century of injustice, permanently unite a nation. That kind of easy resolution happens only at the conclusion of bad sports films. </p> <p>As it happens, runners don't do much more than win races. The casual linguistic racism that pockmarks the conversation of far too much of Australian society (from long jumpers to leading politicians) will not disappear simply because an Aborigine landed a gold medal.

So you could go into a show room and buy a new car on your Switch card and drive it away there and then.

The Clearing House Automated Payment System (Chaps) allows for the same-day transfer of unlimited sums of money from one bank account to another. The charges are higher than a bank draft, usually around \u00a320 to \u00a325, and you'll need to be able to supply all the account details needed for sending the money.</p> <p>This system was set up as a channel for businesses to shift money around (the average transfer size is \u00a32m), but there has been an increase in ordinary consumers using the network to make urgent payments, so that 40% of transfers are now for less than \u00a310,000.</p> <p>But Chaps is a \"Rolls-Royce system\", says Richard Tyson-Davies of the Association for Payment Clearing Services, and in the same way that you wouldn't want to use the Roller to go down to the shops, it's not built for huge numbers of small transfers.</p> <p>Instead, he says, next year should see the introduction of a consumer-level network, using the internet, which would allow for the immediate movement of money between accounts. So, instead of asking the bank for a draft, you could carry out a transfer of money over the internet with the funds clearing the same day.</p> <p>Once such a system is in place, it can only further hasten the demise of the cheque. Already we're happy to pay for holidays over the phone with a credit card and to make big household purchases on a debit card; an automated payment system for larger sums would add another layer of dust to the family cheque book.</p> <p>And once cheques become even more of a backwater - forecasts claim that within a decade only one in 10 purchases will be paid by cheque - there will be even less pressure to speed up the clearing cycle. Which means we're stuck with it.</p> <p>Email: <a href=\"mailto:coughlan_sean@hotmail.com\">coughlan_sean@hotmail.com</a></p>",

The Clearing House Automated Payment System (Chaps) allows for the same-day transfer of unlimited sums of money from one bank account to another. The charges are higher than a bank draft, usually around \u00a320 to \u00a325, and you'll need to be able to supply all the account details needed for sending the money. This system was set up as a channel for businesses to shift money around (the average transfer size is \u00a32m), but there has been an increase in ordinary consumers using the network to make urgent payments, so that 40% of transfers are now for less than \u00a310,000. But Chaps is a \"Rolls-Royce system\", says Richard Tyson-Davies of the Association for Payment Clearing Services, and in the same way that you wouldn't want to use the Roller to go down to the shops, it's not built for huge numbers of small transfers. Instead, he says, next year should see the introduction of a consumer-level network, using the internet, which would allow for the immediate movement of money between accounts. So, instead of asking the bank for a draft, you could carry out a transfer of money over the internet with the funds clearing the same day. Once such a system is in place, it can only further hasten the demise of the cheque. Already we're happy to pay for holidays over the phone with a credit card and to make big household purchases on a debit card; an automated payment system for larger sums would add another layer of dust to the family cheque book. And once cheques become even more of a backwater - forecasts claim that within a decade only one in 10 purchases will be paid by cheque - there will be even less pressure to speed up the clearing cycle. Which means we're stuck with it. Email: coughlan_sean@hotmail.com",

      "body": "<p>There's never been a better time for homeowners to save money by moving their mortgage to another lender. So goes the spiel from mortgage brokers and lenders - whose livelihoods, of course, depend on us buying their products. </p> <p>However, far from being a hollow boast, they could well have a point. A number of factors have come together to make now a very good time for people to dig out their home loan documents and consider their remortgaging options. </p> <p>The cut-throat competition raging in the mortgage market means there are some very good deals around for those looking to switch. While the typical bank standard variable mortgage rate is 7.74%, there are a number of penalty-free fixed-rate and discounted deals available priced at below 6%. </p> <p>For an interest-only borrower with an \u00a380,000 mortgage who is currently paying the standard rate and is not locked in, switching to a rate of, say, 5.75% fixed for two years could give a saving of almost \u00a3133 a month. That adds up to a staggering \u00a33,184 over two years. </p> <p>Over the past few months fixed rates have been edging downwards, despite the fact that interest rates have remained unchanged since February. At the same time, more and more lenders are now throwing in a free valuation and will pay most or all of your legal fees if you remortgage with them. Some times they will waive the arrangement fee as well. </p> <p>\"The case for remortgaging has never been stronger,\" says Simon Knight at Independent Mortgage Collection, a network of mortgage brokers. </p> <p>There are no hard figures but it is estimated that around half of the UK's homeowners are on their lender's standard rate. Many of them could walk away at any time because there are no early redemption penalties locking them into the deal. </p> <p>If you are considering moving your mortgage, the type of deal you should go for will obviously depend on your own financial circumstances and where you see interest rates going. If you're on a tight budget, you may want to opt for the certainty offered by a fixed-rate mortgage - with these, you know exactly what your monthly payments will be and you won't suffer any nasty shocks should interest rates shoot up suddenly. Others will take the view that a discounted mortgage is a good idea because it will enable them to benefit from the anticipated future rate cuts. </p> <p>Here we look at some of the different categories of borrower and whether they should consider remortgaging to reduce their costs. </p> <p> <strong> Borrowers on the standard variable rate with no redemption penalties</strong> </p> <p>It is thought that around 25% of homeowners are paying their lender's standard rate and yet could leave and take up a cheaper deal at any time because they are not tied in by lock-in penalties. It's hard to disagree with the verdict of brokers who argue that these people are simply throwing money away. </p> <p> <strong>Borrowers on the standard variable rate with redemption penalties</strong> </p> <p>Again, it is estimated that several million homeowners are tied in to their lender's standard variable rate by an early redemption penalty. If you are in this sort of position, the first thing you should do is talk to your lender to see if there are any other products they will let you switch into. If they won't play ball, the choice is either stay where you are or pay the redemption penalty so you can move to another lender's cheaper deal. You'll need to do a bit of maths on this because you need to make sure that paying the penalty and going elsewhere will cost you less than staying on the standard rate. </p> <p>If you've only got a few months or, perhaps, a year to go until the penalty runs out, you would probably be better-off staying put and then moving as soon as you are free to do so. </p> <p>There is now a simple way of finding out whether or not it's worth remortgaging. Bath-based mortgage broker London &amp; Country has developed a redemption penalty calculator that enables you to quickly find out whether you could save by switching. You need to phone 0800 373 300 and tell them the size of your mortgage, the rate you are on, and the amout of the redemption penalty and how long you are tied in for. The service is free. Financial services website <a href=\"http://www.moneysupermarket.com\">www.money supermarket.com</a> has just launched a similar online service called \"Redemption Buster\". </p> <p> <strong> Borrowers on annual review schemes</strong> </p> <p>Up to 3m people are on so-called annual review schemes, where your monthly repayments are set once a year - normally between January and April - and don't fluctuate despite interest rate changes. </p> <p>Many of these borrowers face a sharp increase in their monthly payments in the new year because these will be recalculated to take into account the two interest rate rises earlier this year and the abolition of mortgage interest tax relief (Miras) back in April. </p> <p>In all, an annual review borrower with a \u00a350,000 home loan could see his or her mortgage payments rise by \u00a332 a month - that's \u00a3385 over a year. So, the message is: think about remortgaging now to beat the increase. </p> <p> <strong> People with small mortgages</strong> </p> <p>\"The smaller your mortgage, the less worthwhile it is likely to be to remortgage,\" says Ray Boulger at mortgage broker John Charcol. That's because some of the costs you may have to pay will be the same whatever the size of your loan. And most lenders will not allow remortgages for less than \u00a325,000, he adds. </p> <p>With literally thousands of mortgage deals out there to choose from, it's no wonder many people find the idea of switching to a new deal daunting. However, the internet is making it easier than ever to find the mortgage that's right for you. </p> <p>Many of the websites allow you to search for the deals that meet your particular requirements, compare products from different lenders and see what the monthly payments would be. NetMortgage (<a href=\"http://www.netmortgage.co.uk\">www.netmortgage.co.uk</a>), the online service of mortgage broker Savills, carries details of home loans from 120 lenders, while Charcolonline, John Charcol's online arm, has more than 500 mortgages from 45-plus lenders in its database. </p> <p>Other useful sites include Moneyfacts (<a href=\"http://www.moneyfacts.co.uk\">www.money facts.co.uk</a>) and E-Loan (<a href=\"http://www.eloan.com/uk\">www.eloan.com/uk</a>). </p> <p>While the brokers want you to apply online using their sites, there's nothing to stop you using them as a free research tool. </p> <p><strong>The best deals</strong></p> <p>These, according to the experts, are some of the best remortgage deals to be had: </p> <p>\u0095 John Charcol is offering a three-year fixed rate it says is the cheapest on the market - 5.89% fixed until July 31 2003. There is a free valuation, no legal fees to pay on remortgages, but there is a redemption penalty of 3% of the loan until the end of the fixed-rate period. Minimum loan is \u00a375,000. The deal is funded by Principality building society. </p> <p>\u0095 For those who don't want penalties, Stroud &amp; Swindon building society has a two-year deal fixed at 5.95% until November 1 2002. Again, there is a free valuation and the legal fees are covered, but there is a \u00a3295 completion fee. They will lend up to 85%. After the fixed rate runs out you are guaranteed a 0.5% discount off the standard rate until November 2005. </p> <p>\u0095 Also penalty-free is a 5.75% deal fixed until October 1 2002 from Portman building society. Again there is a free valuation and the legal fees are paid. There is a \u00a3300 acceptance fee. They will lend up to 95%. </p> <p>\u0095 The Halifax is offering a base rate tracker deal where you pay bank base rate minus 0.45% until December 31 2002 - with the base rate currently 6%, that gives a current payment rate of 5.55%. There are no fees, no redemption penalties at any time, and the maximum loan is 75%.</p>",

The cut-throat competition raging in the mortgage market means there are some very good deals around for those looking to switch. While the typical bank standard variable mortgage rate is 7.74%, there are a number of penalty-free fixed-rate and discounted deals available priced at below 6%. For an interest-only borrower with an \u00a380,000 mortgage who is currently paying the standard rate and is not locked in, switching to a rate of, say, 5.75% fixed for two years could give a saving of almost \u00a3133 a month. That adds up to a staggering \u00a33,184 over two years. Over the past few months fixed rates have been edging downwards, despite the fact that interest rates have remained unchanged since February. At the same time, more and more lenders are now throwing in a free valuation and will pay most or all of your legal fees if you remortgage with them. Some times they will waive the arrangement fee as well. \"The case for remortgaging has never been stronger,\" says Simon Knight at Independent Mortgage Collection, a network of mortgage brokers. There are no hard figures but it is estimated that around half of the UK's homeowners are on their lender's standard rate. Many of them could walk away at any time because there are no early redemption penalties locking them into the deal. If you are considering moving your mortgage, the type of deal you should go for will obviously depend on your own financial circumstances and where you see interest rates going. If you're on a tight budget, you may want to opt for the certainty offered by a fixed-rate mortgage - with these, you know exactly what your monthly payments will be and you won't suffer any nasty shocks should interest rates shoot up suddenly. Others will take the view that a discounted mortgage is a good idea because it will enable them to benefit from the anticipated future rate cuts. Here we look at some of the different categories of borrower and whether they should consider remortgaging to reduce their costs. Borrowers on the standard variable rate with no redemption penalties It is thought that around 25% of homeowners are paying their lender's standard rate and yet could leave and take up a cheaper deal at any time because they are not tied in by lock-in penalties. It's hard to disagree with the verdict of brokers who argue that these people are simply throwing money away. Borrowers on the standard variable rate with redemption penalties Again, it is estimated that several million homeowners are tied in to their lender's standard variable rate by an early redemption penalty. If you are in this sort of position, the first thing you should do is talk to your lender to see if there are any other products they will let you switch into. If they won't play ball, the choice is either stay where you are or pay the redemption penalty so you can move to another lender's cheaper deal. You'll need to do a bit of maths on this because you need to make sure that paying the penalty and going elsewhere will cost you less than staying on the standard rate. If you've only got a few months or, perhaps, a year to go until the penalty runs out, you would probably be better-off staying put and then moving as soon as you are free to do so. There is now a simple way of finding out whether or not it's worth remortgaging. Bath-based mortgage broker London &amp; Country has developed a redemption penalty calculator that enables you to quickly find out whether you could save by switching. You need to phone 0800 373 300 and tell them the size of your mortgage, the rate you are on, and the amout of the redemption penalty and how long you are tied in for. The service is free. Financial services website www.money supermarket.com has just launched a similar online service called \"Redemption Buster\". Borrowers on annual review schemes Up to 3m people are on so-called annual review schemes, where your monthly repayments are set once a year - normally between January and April - and don't fluctuate despite interest rate changes. Many of these borrowers face a sharp increase in their monthly payments in the new year because these will be recalculated to take into account the two interest rate rises earlier this year and the abolition of mortgage interest tax relief (Miras) back in April. In all, an annual review borrower with a \u00a350,000 home loan could see his or her mortgage payments rise by \u00a332 a month - that's \u00a3385 over a year. So, the message is: think about remortgaging now to beat the increase. People with small mortgages \"The smaller your mortgage, the less worthwhile it is likely to be to remortgage,\" says Ray Boulger at mortgage broker John Charcol. That's because some of the costs you may have to pay will be the same whatever the size of your loan. And most lenders will not allow remortgages for less than \u00a325,000, he adds. With literally thousands of mortgage deals out there to choose from, it's no wonder many people find the idea of switching to a new deal daunting. However, the internet is making it easier than ever to find the mortgage that's right for you. Many of the websites allow you to search for the deals that meet your particular requirements, compare products from different lenders and see what the monthly payments would be. NetMortgage (www.netmortgage.co.uk), the online service of mortgage broker Savills, carries details of home loans from 120 lenders, while Charcolonline, John Charcol's online arm, has more than 500 mortgages from 45-plus lenders in its database. Other useful sites include Moneyfacts (www.money facts.co.uk) and E-Loan (www.eloan.com/uk). While the brokers want you to apply online using their sites, there's nothing to stop you using them as a free research tool. The best deals These, according to the experts, are some of the best remortgage deals to be had: \u0095 John Charcol is offering a three-year fixed rate it says is the cheapest on the market - 5.89% fixed until July 31 2003. There is a free valuation, no legal fees to pay on remortgages, but there is a redemption penalty of 3% of the loan until the end of the fixed-rate period. Minimum loan is \u00a375,000. The deal is funded by Principality building society. \u0095 For those who don't want penalties, Stroud &amp; Swindon building society has a two-year deal fixed at 5.95% until November 1 2002. Again, there is a free valuation and the legal fees are covered, but there is a \u00a3295 completion fee. They will lend up to 85%. After the fixed rate runs out you are guaranteed a 0.5% discount off the standard rate until November 2005. \u0095 Also penalty-free is a 5.75% deal fixed until October 1 2002 from Portman building society. Again there is a free valuation and the legal fees are paid. There is a \u00a3300 acceptance fee. They will lend up to 95%. \u0095 The Halifax is offering a base rate tracker deal where you pay bank base rate minus 0.45% until December 31 2002 - with the base rate currently 6%, that gives a current payment rate of 5.55%. There are no fees, no redemption penalties at any time, and the maximum loan is 75%.",

More than two million people have viewed it since it opened, despite the fact that it's never seen the inside of a cinema or TV screen. 405 (<a href=\"http://www.IFilm.com\" target=\"_new\">IFilm.com</a>) is a tense, special-effects-packed action spectacular. Which is admirable, considering it's all of two minutes and 58 seconds long. And you can only see it on the internet.</p> <p>Welcome to the world of webfilm. With 13 million UK internet users, part of an estimated 300 million users worldwide, the net has rapidly grown beyond its initial provision of information, communication and consumer services. Over 70% of domestic users now claim their online priority is entertainment. And increasingly they're finding it where their great-grandparents did, in short films and saucy animations. The penny arcade and the Kinetoscope have been reincarnated for an internet audience in short-film sites and the webfilm. </p> <p>By webfilm we mean the broad and varied swathe of moving-image entertainment which is viewable on the internet either via streamed video or downloadable files (see <a href=\"#learn\">'Learn what works'</a>). In addition to innumerable independent films, you can find popular animated and live-action film series such as Lil' Pimp (<a href=\"http://www.mediatrip.com/home/index_pimp.html\" target=\"_new\"> mediatrip.com</a>) or Bikini Bandits (<a href=\"http://www.AtomFilms.com\" target=\"_new\">AtomFilms</a>), episodic movies like Running Time (<a href=\"http://www.itsyourmovie.com\" target=\"_new\">itsyourmovie.com</a>), linear or interactive cartoons at <a href=\"http://www.Shockwave.com\" target=\"_new\">Shockwave</a> and <a href=\"http://www.Icebox.com\" target=\"new\">Icebox.com</a>, and even web-specific film works at <a href=\"http://www.TheBitScreen.com\" target=\"_new\">TheBitScreen.com</a>. </p> <p>What they all have in common is that they're short. They suit our impatient lifestyle, and fit our MTV-honed attention spans. Webfilms have become the espresso of the entertainment world, providing office workers with a fun 'hit' during a busy day. Most of all however, we love shorts because they suit the limited bandwidth available to most domestic internet surfers, who are dependent on 28.8k or 56k dial-up modems.</p> <p>Barely two years old as a concept, webfilm is only just past its goldrush period, so sites and film content are comparatively diverse compared with traditional media outlets. Though the majority of viewer traffic is inevitably towards American titles on mainstream sites, you'll find that international offerings, films made by artists often for gallery exhibition, and experimental interactive work are also uniquely accessible on the web. To gauge the full range of what's on offer, dip into our reviews of 40-odd handpicked sites, where you can mind the quality and feel the bandwidth. </p> <p>But most importantly, get out there now and start viewing. Pleasingly diverse content on short film sites will only last as long as the venture capital funding that is currently sustaining all but the most successful of them. Watching shorts is a painless, often surprisingly pleasurable way to expand your film horizons. If you swear blind you don't enjoy foreign, 'extreme', guerrilla, spoof, experimental, or interactive media, make your motto 'suck it and see'.

      "bodyText": "I've just watched a movie that you'll never have heard of. More than two million people have viewed it since it opened, despite the fact that it's never seen the inside of a cinema or TV screen. 405 (IFilm.com) is a tense, special-effects-packed action spectacular. Which is admirable, considering it's all of two minutes and 58 seconds long. And you can only see it on the internet. Welcome to the world of webfilm. With 13 million UK internet users, part of an estimated 300 million users worldwide, the net has rapidly grown beyond its initial provision of information, communication and consumer services. Over 70% of domestic users now claim their online priority is entertainment. And increasingly they're finding it where their great-grandparents did, in short films and saucy animations. The penny arcade and the Kinetoscope have been reincarnated for an internet audience in short-film sites and the webfilm. By webfilm we mean the broad and varied swathe of moving-image entertainment which is viewable on the internet either via streamed video or downloadable files (see 'Learn what works'). In addition to innumerable independent films, you can find popular animated and live-action film series such as Lil' Pimp ( mediatrip.com) or Bikini Bandits (AtomFilms), episodic movies like Running Time (itsyourmovie.com), linear or interactive cartoons at Shockwave and Icebox.com, and even web-specific film works at TheBitScreen.com. What they all have in common is that they're short. They suit our impatient lifestyle, and fit our MTV-honed attention spans. Webfilms have become the espresso of the entertainment world, providing office workers with a fun 'hit' during a busy day. Most of all however, we love shorts because they suit the limited bandwidth available to most domestic internet surfers, who are dependent on 28.8k or 56k dial-up modems. Barely two years old as a concept, webfilm is only just past its goldrush period, so sites and film content are comparatively diverse compared with traditional media outlets. Though the majority of viewer traffic is inevitably towards American titles on mainstream sites, you'll find that international offerings, films made by artists often for gallery exhibition, and experimental interactive work are also uniquely accessible on the web. To gauge the full range of what's on offer, dip into our reviews of 40-odd handpicked sites, where you can mind the quality and feel the bandwidth. But most importantly, get out there now and start viewing. Pleasingly diverse content on short film sites will only last as long as the venture capital funding that is currently sustaining all but the most successful of them. Watching shorts is a painless, often surprisingly pleasurable way to expand your film horizons. If you swear blind you don't enjoy foreign, 'extreme', guerrilla, spoof, experimental, or interactive media, make your motto 'suck it and see'.

He ought to possess exactly the brash, sentimental imagination needed to tackle pop music's most glamorously tacky and emotional band. Disappointingly, though, Maurice B\u00e9jart's Ballet for Life, set to a soundtrack of Queen and Mozart and celebrating the lives of artists who die young, is not the theatrical romp that it sounds like. </p> <p>To fans of Queen (there were hundreds on Thursday night) the music features a dream selection of hits, while Julien Favreau as a peroxided, tarted-up Mercury presents an appropriately camp interpretation of their star. The basic theme of the choreography is of youth and hopefulness cocking a snook at death, and its sequence of mildly surreal interludes is clearly designed to mirror the energy and the lyrics of the songs. A crowd of glossily muscled men writhe and boogy to Radio Gaga, a man in Union Jack tights leaps brightly and dandily to Millionaire Waltz, and assorted couples embrace and pose. </p> <p>The costumes designed by the late Gianni Versace (to whom this ballet is now also a retrospective tribute) make the dancers look wonderful. The chorus are dressed in a sleek variety of sports outfits; the principal men wear blade-thin trousers with fishnet seams, and some of the women get to parade in extravagantly cut and detailed ball gowns. As a group they look fabulous, yet a frustrating proportion of the choreography that B\u00e9jart gives them is uninventive and bland. A few split kicks, a few drastic stretches, a little bit of disco filtered through some lame ballet steps. Any halfway decent pop video could produce more intoxicating stuff. </p> <p>Where the dancing does take off is in the choreography for Gil Roman, who stands for the other artist remembered in the show, Jorge Donn (B\u00e9jart's long-time star dancer who, like Mercury, died from Aids). Much of Roman's movement is set to extracts from Mozart - and it's interesting that B\u00e9jart finds far more punch and fury in this music than he does in Queen. Certainly Roman dances a charismatic storm - his small, neat body self-flagellating in its energy, yet brilliantly precise in its phrasing and line. He is a candle lit to Donn - and to the ephemeral nature of every dancer's career - and as such he is far more flattering to Donn's memory than the film footage played of the latter's dancing, which is screened towards the close of the show. The accompanying song, I Want To Break Free, may be one of Queen's most powerful hits, but the filming of Donn's dancing isn't particularly sympathetic to his talent, and the whole sequence comes as an unwelcome longueur in a show that at 105 minutes is indulgently overextended . </p> <p>It ends, finally, on one blissfully outrageous crescendo. Master of theatrical cliche that he is, B\u00e9jart has his whole cast advance downstage in choral slow motion to The Show Must Go On. But while Thursday night's Queen fan club rose in an ecstatic ovation, I suspect they were responding as much to their own memories of the band as to B\u00e9jart's show. For it is actually only the choreography for Roman that convinces us of B\u00e9jart's real engagement with his material. Nothing about the rest of the production makes me believe he was ever, himself, a genuine Queen fan. </p> <p>Rock music has its own rogue energy, its own thrashing rhythms, its own institutionalised wildness that it's hard for classically based dance to match. For rock and ballet to work, the choreographer has to be personally passionate about the music. There has to be something he or she believes about it other than the fact that it makes a handily familiar and funky soundtrack. </p> <p> Final performances this afternoon and evening.

If Cole had played a game or two for England that would be one thing. But for me it would be too much of a gamble to throw him in now. </p> <p>He's a talent, one for the future, but he's got very few league games under his belt and he hasn't played in big matches for West Ham. You could take a Manchester United kid who had made a similar number of appearances but some would have been massive games like those coming up. </p> <p>I'm not saying I would start with Sheringham but I would certainly have him on the bench. He's used to these occasions and could come on and play with Andy Cole, whom he's partnered at United to brilliant effect. </p> <p>If Sheringham is disappointed, David Beckham must be delighted to be vice-captain of his country. I saw him get stupidly booked in Eindhoven but he wants to captain England and this is a nice little carrot. </p> <p>The debate on where he should play is sure to come up again, and I would keep him in the centre. A lot of the outcome at Wembley could come down to bravery, not just in the physical sense but in terms of who shows the courage to get on the ball and dominate the match. I would tell Beckham to dictate the game. </p> <p>In any case England have a good right-sided midfielder in Kieron Dyer. I think he'll be a great international because he runs at people and not many defenders are good at dealing with that. </p> <p>Against Germany those qualities look particularly important because if you make Christian Ziege defend on their left you eliminate the big threat he poses coming forward. That would make life a lot easier for the lads at the back. </p> <p>In that department Keegan will be keeping just about everything crossed that Tony Adams and Martin Keown stay fit. Against Germany, Adams will not be up against a typical continental striker, full of darting runs and subtle touches; Oliver Bierhoff and Carsten Jancker are not like that and Adams thrives on the sort of physical battle he'll face. </p> <p>I understand that the former Milan coach Arrigo Sacchi compared him with Franco Baresi after Arsenal's game against Lazio.

      "bodyText": "Leeds have been given renewed hope of signing Monaco's midfielder John Arne Riise for \u00a34m in a deal which has twice come apart at the seams when the French club refused to lower their \u00a36m price for the 20-year-old Norwegian. Riise was left out of the squad for Monaco's Champions League match with Sturm Graz after reiterating his desire to move to Elland Road. \"I have had meetings with Monaco and I hope we can come to an agreement,\" said Berit Riise, his mother and agent. \"The distance between the valuations is not that big any more. Tottenham's Darren Anderton may feature at Leeds tomorrow. The midfielder, who came through 90 minutes for the reserves on Wednesday, was expected to be out for six to eight weeks after a groin problem this month. \"Things don't usually happen quickly for me when I get injured,\" he said. \"So this is a nice surprise. I had complete rest for about a week, did nothing, let nature do its thing and that seems to have helped.\" Everton's Francis Jeffers will be sidelined for eight weeks after damaging ankle liga ments during the Worthington Cup defeat at Bristol Rovers. The Merseysiders are expected to announce that they have tied up a deal with the cable television network NTL which is understood to be worth about \u00a322m for a 9.9% stake. NTL, which has stakes in Aston Villa, Leicester, Middlesbrough and Newcastle, would be guaranteed merchandising and broadcasting rights. Southend have sacked their manager Alan Little. Mick Gooding will take charge while the club look for somebody who will \"get us back into the Second Division\". Sheffield Wednesday have signed Steve Harkness, 29, from Blackburn for \u00a3200,000. Arthur Cox has left Fulham, where he was director of football, to concentrate on his role as an England coach.",

No more traditional cross-party agreement with the Tory clubmen who block change - Labour must lay down the law on parliamentary reform.

Old neo-endogenous growth Gordon or even \"y'know\" Blair on Richard and Judy's sofa don't reach women with that story.</p> <p>Men talking about childcare sound patronising.

The political arena of jousting boys on the make doesn't just leave women politicians out, it leaves women voters out too.

Mr Steele, 61, had already approached the local constabulary who told him they had no problem with the one-off blank firing. He said of the diktat: \"It's really going to spoil it for us.\" Mrs Pudney, 51, was crestfallen at the superintendent's decision. \"It's very disappointing,\" she said. \"This was going to be the highlight of our wedding because we thought this is how they would have celebrated in those times.\" Despite the ban on fake firearms, the couple will still don traditional Western garb and hope many of their guests will too. Wiltshire Times Farmers set sail for cows week Seven farm workers from Perthshire are to represent Scotland at the Third International Herdmen's Meeting in Tyrol, Austria. The Scots, who are determined to be great national ambassadors, will organise a mini-Highland Games and are taking a mini-caber specially made for the occasion. Festivities at the international event kick off with the March of the Herdsmen followed by a field mass. Excitement will reach fever pitch in the afternoon with demonstrations of goat herding running alongside a market of rural products. A report on the extinction of old animal races in the Alps by Professor Dr Ambros Aichhorn should get everyone's juices flowing before the herdsmen get the chance to visit a farm. And as if all that wasn't enough, a multi-vision presentation entitled Where is the Tyrol? will be followed by a discussion on the subject. What fun. Blairgrove Advertiser Self-raising flower The competition was fierce but no one could deny that Rex Saunby had the biggest sunflower in Market Rasen. At 13ft 14in, Rex's entry in the sunflower competition was the talk of the village with rumours of a secret recipe. But Mr Saunby, who has reportedly being growing sunflowers for years, refused to comment. The contest was sparked by the mayor of Market Rasen, Sue Briggs, who grew a giant sunflower in her garden. Market Rasen Mail Island life The traffic island in front of the church in Belper has finally been officially named. The area has long been known as the Triangle by local people and now Amber Valley Borough Council has bowed to popular demand and put up signs recognising the fact. Belper Town councillor Alan Cox, who was instrumental in securing the new signage, said: \"John Nelson and myself brought up the ideas during a town council meeting. I am glad the council has taken up the suggestion because now everyone will know where the Triangle is.\" Belper News Pig ignorant A rare pig is in a critical condition after falling into the River Stour. Owner, smallholder Paul Woodhall, was said to be very concerned after veterinary treatment failed to help the 25 stone Gloucester Old Spot sow which was in shock from the unexpected dip. The pig's travails led to the fire brigade's boat being sent to the area from Bewdley. Redditch Advertiser Letter of the week: anus horribilis I have lived in Newhaven all my life, only leaving the town for six months during the war and two years in the army. So Newhaven is my kind of town, my grandfather and my uncle were members of the town council for a great number of years. So I do know my town of Newhaven. Why is Lewes so favoured and Newhaven not? In Lewes, down the Avenue, the pavements have been done with pink terracotta paving slabs while in Newhaven's Chapel Street the pavement is a slope of 45 degrees and only about two feet wide, and made from tarmac. In Lewes precinct there is not a brick out of place! In Newhaven precinct there is a patchwork of tarmac from one end to the other. No wonder people don't come into the town, it's a disgrace! What the people of Newhaven want to know is, who are the people in the corridors of power in Lewes that are turning Newhaven into the anus of Sussex? We in Newhaven are fed up with it.

      "byline": "Deborah Bee",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Soooooo, spot anything lovely at London Fashion week? Crocheted thong? Mussel shell skirt? Latex bodysuit? British fashion has certainly been living up to its reputation. Though equally renowned for excellent tailoring and truly innovative design, you can always rely on our lot to transform mere clothes into fantastical costumes, turning fashion shows into theatrical events. </p> <p>You can also rely on the fact that the best of those young Brits will get swept off to head up a fashion house abroad. But back home, Britain has yet to produce a designer who can translate this avant-garde creativity into a global brand. There is no British equivalent of Calvin Klein, Karl Lagerfeld or Giorgio Armani. </p> <p>Twenty-seven years ago, five bright young designers, with similar reputations for wild behaviour, were launched on to the international fashion circuit by the recently formed British Fashion Council, whose main objective was to promote a previously nonexistent London designer scene. Bruce Oldfield, a striking 23-year-old, was one of them. He now plays down his bad boy reputation for clubbing with the pop star set. </p> <p>\"It was a fantastically exciting time,\" he enthuses. \"We were called the New Wave. There are people who would say I was outrageous back then but I think I'm quite conservative. I remember walking into a club in Jermyn Street with Grace Jones in the 70s and whispering: 'Er, you know, um, when we go in, I think a little less cracking of the whip would be, um, a good thing' and she was like: 'Oh, get a life'.\" </p> <p>Today Bruce Oldfield is a happy man. Still sparky and handsome, he runs a small but exclusive couture house from an elegant showroom in Beauchamp Place, supplying sumptuous eveningwear to the upper echelons of British and American society. Ladies who lunch love him. </p> <p>\"I run a very small business,\" he says simply. \"I wouldn't want it to be any bigger. I'm not sure I'd be any good at joining the big bad world.\" </p> <p>Oldfield doesn't blame British fashion for our lack of global commercial success. \"The British public is not interested in clothes,\" he points out. \"The nearest we get to an international conglomerate is M&amp;S.\" </p> <p>Having made the transition from cool to esteemed, Oldfield is well-placed to pinpoint the problems. \"After the war,\" he says, \"Britain was de-skilled by the need for cheap clothing. The workers were replaced with machines. There are now very few factories in the UK that can produce any kind of desirable garments in any kind of quantity. It's frightening.\" </p> <p>The British government has recognised this problem and last week announced a \u00a31.5m handout. Oldfield doesn't believe this will solve the problem. \"What went hand in hand with the need for cheaper clothing was the inherent notion that clothing was a little bit silly, a little bit frivolous. They are quite puritanical, the British. It's considered poor taste to show your wealth. Even now I have customers who wouldn't want their staff to know how much they have spent on a dress. The British don't like show-offs and they don't like clothes that are showy-offy.\" </p> <p>The only section of the British public truly interested in fashion, Oldfield maintains, doesn't have the income to support designers. \"They are all under 25 and spend what they have in Top Shop. Serious earners have many different calls on their income. Private education, for example.\" </p> <p>He is quick to point out how ironic it is that a country that spends relatively little on designer goods is renowned for producing the most creative students in the world. \"Most of them, certainly the ones who get noticed, are wacky. They are encouraged to treat fashion like caricature. They're told: 'You're so outrageous and cutting edge. Go on, go on, do it. Make something else that won't sell.' If they are given the platform to do that, of course they will, then they'll sink without trace. Someone will put money behind them, they'll have a few seasons, but they have to get real in a very short space of time. Most don't.\" </p> <p>Oldfield believes we are churning out too many designers. From the original five, London Fashion Week now has 49 shows and over 150 exhibitors. \"I'm a governor of the London Institute, which covers St Martins and the London College of Fashion, but I'm not always sure our fashion schools give out the right messages.\" </p> <p>Oldfield's own fashion education began after following a career in art. \"I only studied at St Martins for eight months. I found it a little over-intellectual. I didn't want to hear: 'The bike has two wheels, so design a collection around the bike.' I have imagination and creativity. But the practical side was great: we were trained to cut clothes, make clothes, design clothes; we were taught how to enhance the form. That's what good design is all about - it's not about engaging somebody's mind in some kind of philosophical debate.\" </p> <p>So how does he feel when a designer says he is inspired by homeless people? \"I laugh. No, actually I don't laugh. I think, what system is producing that kind of a response?\" </p> <p>But it's often these same designers that get taken up by a foreign company with lots of money and plenty of products to sell. Oldfield seems almost wistful on the subject. \"I got sent the Dior catalogue the other day. It's very, very beautiful, a glamorous book, but there's not a garment in it. They are only selling bags. What Galliano produces is fabulous, it's wonderful, it makes good press. But Galliano doesn't have to worry about whether or not his clothes are selling. Our young designers can't hope to compete.\" </p> <p>The news isn't all bad, though. The UK clothing and textile industry is the seventh largest in the country and at first glance, the designer sector also looks relatively healthy. Since 1990 it has grown threefold and is currently worth \u00a3600m - but compare that with Calvin Klein's turnover of \u00a32.76b. </p> <p>\"Rifat Ozbek was the first designer based here to understand the system and milk it,\" Oldfield says. \"He chose Britain as a creative launchpad, then when he moved to Paris, there was a big brouhaha about him abandoning London. I thought, why not? Paris gets more buyers and press.\" </p> <p>Presumably this idea would not go down well with the British Fashion Council. But Oldfield is known for being outspoken - not in a dramatic, fashiony way, he simply knows his business. Twenty-five years on, one of the original bad boys may no longer make it into the gossip columns, but he makes very nice dresses at very nice prices. Did he have to tone down his creativity in order to appeal to his more conservative clientele? </p> <p>\"I know my customers - I know where they go on holiday, where they live, what car they drive. A great preponderance of them are aged between 35 and 55, but these women don't want to be told they are getting on and that they should be wearing something a bit more sensible.\" </p> <p>Is he envious of his international contemporaries whose names adorn the waistbands of underpants across the world? \"Would I be any happier if I had shops all around the world, perfumes and bedlinen?

      "bodyText": "Soooooo, spot anything lovely at London Fashion week? Crocheted thong? Mussel shell skirt? Latex bodysuit? British fashion has certainly been living up to its reputation. Though equally renowned for excellent tailoring and truly innovative design, you can always rely on our lot to transform mere clothes into fantastical costumes, turning fashion shows into theatrical events. You can also rely on the fact that the best of those young Brits will get swept off to head up a fashion house abroad. But back home, Britain has yet to produce a designer who can translate this avant-garde creativity into a global brand. There is no British equivalent of Calvin Klein, Karl Lagerfeld or Giorgio Armani. Twenty-seven years ago, five bright young designers, with similar reputations for wild behaviour, were launched on to the international fashion circuit by the recently formed British Fashion Council, whose main objective was to promote a previously nonexistent London designer scene. Bruce Oldfield, a striking 23-year-old, was one of them. He now plays down his bad boy reputation for clubbing with the pop star set. \"It was a fantastically exciting time,\" he enthuses. \"We were called the New Wave. There are people who would say I was outrageous back then but I think I'm quite conservative. I remember walking into a club in Jermyn Street with Grace Jones in the 70s and whispering: 'Er, you know, um, when we go in, I think a little less cracking of the whip would be, um, a good thing' and she was like: 'Oh, get a life'.\" Today Bruce Oldfield is a happy man. Still sparky and handsome, he runs a small but exclusive couture house from an elegant showroom in Beauchamp Place, supplying sumptuous eveningwear to the upper echelons of British and American society. Ladies who lunch love him. \"I run a very small business,\" he says simply. \"I wouldn't want it to be any bigger. I'm not sure I'd be any good at joining the big bad world.\" Oldfield doesn't blame British fashion for our lack of global commercial success. \"The British public is not interested in clothes,\" he points out. \"The nearest we get to an international conglomerate is M&amp;S.\" Having made the transition from cool to esteemed, Oldfield is well-placed to pinpoint the problems. \"After the war,\" he says, \"Britain was de-skilled by the need for cheap clothing. The workers were replaced with machines. There are now very few factories in the UK that can produce any kind of desirable garments in any kind of quantity. It's frightening.\" The British government has recognised this problem and last week announced a \u00a31.5m handout. Oldfield doesn't believe this will solve the problem. \"What went hand in hand with the need for cheaper clothing was the inherent notion that clothing was a little bit silly, a little bit frivolous. They are quite puritanical, the British. It's considered poor taste to show your wealth. Even now I have customers who wouldn't want their staff to know how much they have spent on a dress. The British don't like show-offs and they don't like clothes that are showy-offy.\" The only section of the British public truly interested in fashion, Oldfield maintains, doesn't have the income to support designers. \"They are all under 25 and spend what they have in Top Shop. Serious earners have many different calls on their income. Private education, for example.\" He is quick to point out how ironic it is that a country that spends relatively little on designer goods is renowned for producing the most creative students in the world. \"Most of them, certainly the ones who get noticed, are wacky. They are encouraged to treat fashion like caricature. They're told: 'You're so outrageous and cutting edge. Go on, go on, do it. Make something else that won't sell.' If they are given the platform to do that, of course they will, then they'll sink without trace. Someone will put money behind them, they'll have a few seasons, but they have to get real in a very short space of time. Most don't.\" Oldfield believes we are churning out too many designers. From the original five, London Fashion Week now has 49 shows and over 150 exhibitors. \"I'm a governor of the London Institute, which covers St Martins and the London College of Fashion, but I'm not always sure our fashion schools give out the right messages.\" Oldfield's own fashion education began after following a career in art. \"I only studied at St Martins for eight months. I found it a little over-intellectual. I didn't want to hear: 'The bike has two wheels, so design a collection around the bike.' I have imagination and creativity. But the practical side was great: we were trained to cut clothes, make clothes, design clothes; we were taught how to enhance the form. That's what good design is all about - it's not about engaging somebody's mind in some kind of philosophical debate.\" So how does he feel when a designer says he is inspired by homeless people? \"I laugh. No, actually I don't laugh. I think, what system is producing that kind of a response?\" But it's often these same designers that get taken up by a foreign company with lots of money and plenty of products to sell. Oldfield seems almost wistful on the subject. \"I got sent the Dior catalogue the other day. It's very, very beautiful, a glamorous book, but there's not a garment in it. They are only selling bags. What Galliano produces is fabulous, it's wonderful, it makes good press. But Galliano doesn't have to worry about whether or not his clothes are selling. Our young designers can't hope to compete.\" The news isn't all bad, though. The UK clothing and textile industry is the seventh largest in the country and at first glance, the designer sector also looks relatively healthy. Since 1990 it has grown threefold and is currently worth \u00a3600m - but compare that with Calvin Klein's turnover of \u00a32.76b. \"Rifat Ozbek was the first designer based here to understand the system and milk it,\" Oldfield says. \"He chose Britain as a creative launchpad, then when he moved to Paris, there was a big brouhaha about him abandoning London. I thought, why not? Paris gets more buyers and press.\" Presumably this idea would not go down well with the British Fashion Council. But Oldfield is known for being outspoken - not in a dramatic, fashiony way, he simply knows his business. Twenty-five years on, one of the original bad boys may no longer make it into the gossip columns, but he makes very nice dresses at very nice prices. Did he have to tone down his creativity in order to appeal to his more conservative clientele? \"I know my customers - I know where they go on holiday, where they live, what car they drive. A great preponderance of them are aged between 35 and 55, but these women don't want to be told they are getting on and that they should be wearing something a bit more sensible.\" Is he envious of his international contemporaries whose names adorn the waistbands of underpants across the world? \"Would I be any happier if I had shops all around the world, perfumes and bedlinen? I could - it's a good name, people know it - but I don't want that kind of pressure and I don't need to earn more money. I'd be bored on a big, big yacht. I don't want a Rolls-Royce, thank you very much. Is Calvin Klein any happier with what he's got than I am with what I've got? Probably not.\" It's Tuesday September 26 2000. 7.30pm. Queues are forming outside a warehouse in Victoria in readiness for the launch of Alexander McQueen's spring/summer collection. At the Lord Mayor's residence in Mansion House, Bruce Oldfield is celebrating his 50th birthday with a fashion show and charity auction, sponsored by Krug champagne in aid of Barnado's. Oldfield's runway is without sensationalist fashion ploys; his guests lack cool factor. But the models and assembled ladies display some of the most sumptous and elegant couture gowns in the world. Oldfield has won his international acclaim. Even if not a lot of people know it.",

Ballet dancers in particular look like no other breed, with their duck-like walks, their hyper-arched backs and flattened chests. But when I was given tickets to watch the two closing shows of New York Fashion Week, my professional cool was blown entirely as I witnessed for the first time the weird physical demeanour of the models. </p> <p>I'm not talking thin here. Even though some of the women looked painful to me (dancers may not carry much flesh but they do have muscles), I could see that the models had been bred to function as abstract coat-hangers rather than individual performers. In a world in which clothes are judged more as concepts than as real-life outfits, I could see that the skinnier the models were, the more usefully they resembled the original lines and sketches of the designers' notebooks. </p> <p>What I didn't get was the bizarrely strained and graceless walk every model in New York seemed to have adopted as she (or he) clumped down the catwalk in next spring's most desirable clothes. Osteopaths and physiotherapists would have been in shock at the nightmare curvature of the spines on display. Hips were thrust forward at vertiginous angles, torsos rocked back and chins jutted out in an attitude of grim agony. </p> <p>Even odder was the movement that passed as a walk among the women - a curiously stilted prance which, executed in teetering high heels, resulted in a kind of juddering, angry stomp as they paraded by. The fact that all the models had, in addition, to zip down the catwalk at high speed to get through the show, meant that they looked as if they'd all been rounded up for some sadistic boot camp march. </p> <p>Since the models at both shows were following the same routine, I assume there are people out there coaching them to walk this way. But I can't figure out why. When dancers move unnaturally, there's nearly always a good reason. In classical ballet they labour to turn out their hips so that they can lift their legs higher and make themselves look grander, more visible on the stage. They dance on the tips of their toes so that they can move with brilliant speed and create the illusion of defying gravity. When modern dancers contort their bodies into harsh introverted angles, they are creating a kind of expressive human sculpture. But models are meant to be icons of beauty and glamour, so why were they making themselves look so absurd? </p> <p>The drastic S bend in the spine I could just about understand in terms of its enforced elongation of the waist - the cut of certain clothes might, as a result, be better displayed. But what function lay in the clunky walk and the grumpy set of the chin, which simply had the effect of making the models look as if they hated being in their clothes and couldn't wait to kick off their shoes? Why would we in the audience want to buy what the models themselves seemed to loathe wearing? </p> <p>This angry body language might have suited designs that were dark and edgy - rebel chic worn by self-consciously rebellious chicks. But I was watching Donna Karan and Calvin Klein, designers who aim to make women look as if they were born beautiful and expensive. What A-list celeb or high-flying exec would have a fantasy of walking into a room like a sullen, dysfunctional brat? </p> <p>It was ironic, too, that the Karan show was accompanied by a loud, funky soundtrack, which had most of the punters and the press discreetly boogieing in their seats. The models, though, remained resolutely impervious to the music's rhythms and energy, even though they would have looked so much more fun and more desirable had they sashayed down the catwalk like dancers. </p> <p>A little spring, fluency or grace would certainly have produced more flattering movement in the delicate, wittily layered organza skirts in Karan's collection, or in the lithe, sporty dresses of Klein. Yet it wasn't as if the models were clumsy clots. I was sitting near the end of the catwalk and so had a perfect view as they were directed away from the hectic glare of the lights and cameras, and back to their changing room. The transformation was startling as these stiff automatons suddenly relaxed into their natural posture, elegantly and expertly navigating their way up a steep and dimly-lit staircase. </p> <p>I could only conclude that the current catwalk prance is an extreme example of those eccentric affectations that have been assumed by elite classes throughout history. A bizarre, impractical stylisation of behaviour whose function is simply to set apart the group who understand its code.

It is these people on the periphery that I would like to come forward, as it is obviously in their interest; and I would also like to talk to other members of the community who saw anything at all.\" A separate \u00a310,000 reward was offered yesterday for information leading to the conviction of the murderers of Greg Watson, who was stabbed to death during the carnival weekend. Police were criticised for allegedly turning a blind eye to crime committed among the crowd of 1.5m at the carnival. The Greater London Authority is reviewing the annual event to consider whether changes should be made.",

In Saudi Arabia, another person had been beheaded, bringing the total for this year to just over 100.</p> <p>Amnesty International has already published several damning reports on human rights in Saudi Arabia, and last Wednesday it issued another, dealing with the rights of women. The picture, not surprisingly, was one of systematic discrimination against women in many fields of activity, supplemented by arbitrary detentions, floggings and executions.</p> <p>In non-democratic countries, we tend to blame the rulers for human rights abuses, imagining that they merely have to say \"aye\" or \"nay\" and whatever they want will be done. This is rarely the whole story: there are usually powerful interest groups to be considered - and in the case of Saudi Arabia it is the religious authorities, the ulama.</p> <p>Attitudes of society also play a large part. Leaders can set an example, but they always argue that moving too fast will alienate the public. A gradual approach merits some sympathy, but is of little comfort to those whose heads or hands have been chopped off in the meantime, and it can easily turn into an excuse for doing nothing.</p> <p>The Amnesty report documented some appalling cases of domestic violence against wives and rape of household servants in Saudi Arabia. No sensible person would attempt to justify these, either in terms of Islam or acceptable social practice. But because of other traditions, the Saudi system does little to discourage or prevent them.</p> <p>For example, a woman who cries rape risks getting into trouble with the law. If she goes to the police station she may be arrested along the way for walking unaccompanied in the street. If she gets as far as the police station she risks being charged with the crime of qadhf - making slanderous accusations - which is punishable by lashes.</p> <p>Measures proposed by Amnesty include the setting up of refuges where women can be protected from their abusers (often male members of their own family), and the recruitment of female police officers to assist in all cases involving women. Even such modest changes may be too much for the traditionalists to stomach because they would interfere with some long-established prerogatives of men.</p> <p>Nevertheless, there are some encouraging signs. Last year, Crown Prince Abdullah, who is in charge of the day-to-day running of the kingdom, spoke on television about the need to include women in the country's development. And the popular Saudi magazine, al-Majalla, recently published a ten-page feature on domestic violence - something that would have been unthinkable only a few years ago.</p> <p>Amnesty believes the Saudis are on the verge of a constructive dialogue on human rights that may, eventually, bring changes. Despite several requests, the organisation has still not been allowed to make an official visit to the kingdom but it did get an invitation to last week's party and was pleased to accept.</p>",

This is rarely the whole story: there are usually powerful interest groups to be considered - and in the case of Saudi Arabia it is the religious authorities, the ulama. Attitudes of society also play a large part. Leaders can set an example, but they always argue that moving too fast will alienate the public. A gradual approach merits some sympathy, but is of little comfort to those whose heads or hands have been chopped off in the meantime, and it can easily turn into an excuse for doing nothing. The Amnesty report documented some appalling cases of domestic violence against wives and rape of household servants in Saudi Arabia. No sensible person would attempt to justify these, either in terms of Islam or acceptable social practice. But because of other traditions, the Saudi system does little to discourage or prevent them. For example, a woman who cries rape risks getting into trouble with the law. If she goes to the police station she may be arrested along the way for walking unaccompanied in the street. If she gets as far as the police station she risks being charged with the crime of qadhf - making slanderous accusations - which is punishable by lashes. Measures proposed by Amnesty include the setting up of refuges where women can be protected from their abusers (often male members of their own family), and the recruitment of female police officers to assist in all cases involving women. Even such modest changes may be too much for the traditionalists to stomach because they would interfere with some long-established prerogatives of men. Nevertheless, there are some encouraging signs. Last year, Crown Prince Abdullah, who is in charge of the day-to-day running of the kingdom, spoke on television about the need to include women in the country's development. And the popular Saudi magazine, al-Majalla, recently published a ten-page feature on domestic violence - something that would have been unthinkable only a few years ago. Amnesty believes the Saudis are on the verge of a constructive dialogue on human rights that may, eventually, bring changes. Despite several requests, the organisation has still not been allowed to make an official visit to the kingdom but it did get an invitation to last week's party and was pleased to accept.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>starling5</strong> <br> Are you prepared to accept an ethical dimension to your Gaia theory whereby all lives have equal value? Or are we, as humans, entitled to favour ourselves as we must in everyday life?</p> <p><strong>James Lovelock:</strong><br> So far as Gaia is concerned, humans are not special. We're just another species. There is a strong ethic attached to Gaia, and that is that the species that lives well with its environment favours it for its progeny and the species that fouls the environment spoils it for its progeny and goes extinct.</p> <p><strong>nsalt </strong><br> Your thoughts on nuclear power are refreshing. For so long it has been singled out as the evil amongst energy sources while conventional power stations the world over continue to belch their polluting gases. But there is a risk factor with nuclear power even if it's smaller than that of coal etc. Renewable fuels, particularly biomass, used locally on a small scale seem better still. Should we be putting more effort into this research?</p> <p><strong>James Lovelock:</strong><br> Large-scale nuclear power is the only practical way that we have to solve the greenhouse gas problem. Of course we should do everything else as well including renewable fuels, windmills, but we should recognise that these are no substitute.</p> <p><strong>greenday234</strong><br> You probably get asked this a lot, but how did you come to know William Golding, who gave Gaia her/its name? What was he like and what did he think of the theory?</p> <p> <strong>James Lovelock:</strong><br> I knew Bill Golding as a neighbour when I lived in Wiltshire. He was a good friend and we would often talk as we walked to the village post office about half a mile away. When it was something exciting, like Gaia, we would walk well beyond the post office. He liked the theory, perhaps because he had been trained in physics as a student as well as in the arts. He said that if you would put forward a big theory about the earth, you'd better give it a good name and he would call it Gaia. We walked on for 20 minutes talking at cross-purposes because I thought he meant 'gyre' (I have no classics). Then Bill said no, I meant Gaia - the Greek goddess.</p> <p><strong> jjjeremy</strong><br> You say that nuclear power plants may be useful in supply electricity without worsening global warming. But doesn't it take generating extra greenhouse gases to be able to build and then dispose of one nuclear power plant. A nuclear power station also has to be very big to work with a centralised power grid and we would need to build a lot of them across Europe. Wouldn't we just end up with big, inefficient plants and lots more greenhouse gases? <br> Wouldn't it be better to decentralise the grid, build efficiency into useage and the grid, use renewables and take away the subsidies from nuclear power generation and give this to alternatives?</p> <p><strong>James Lovelock:</strong><br> It's true that building a nuclear power plant will require a lot of concrete and release a lot of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. However, a plant runs for 50 years or more, and in that time release vastly less greenhouse gas than fossil fuel-burning power stations. <br> I believe that in Sweden small-scale nuclear power stations have now been designed for public use.</p> <p><strong>kudra</strong> <br> What are your thoughts on the recent fuel 'crisis' and the way that it was/is being handled?</p> <p><strong>James Lovelock:</strong><br> The public response to the recent fuel crisis appalled me. They seemed to have no idea whatsoever of the dangers that lie ahead and thought only of their immediate personal needs. I should not have been surprised because in China, with its truly powerful government, they have admitted that they cannot hold back the personal aspirations of the people where burning fossil fuels is concerned. <br> In a survey during the Suez fuel crisis, people interviewed claimed to be prepared to pay so much for fuel that their families would be in danger of privation. They valued personal mobility above all else. This is a human characteristic. <br> I think the Chancellor is right - you've got to be tough on this one.</p> <p><strong> nisaac </strong><br> I think that Gaia is a great metaphor for processes in the biosphere. However, I've been disappointed to find that other ecologists instinctively recoil at the idea of the Planet Personified. Whilst they are right to argue in favour of rigorous hypothesis testing, we all need some kind of bigger picture. What do you make of this? Where is the halfway house?</p> <p><strong>James Lovelock:</strong><br> I think the biologists fight dirty. You have to use metaphor to explain science to people. The biologists have the wonderful metaphor of the selfish gene. No one challenges them, saying 'how absurd - how could a gene take thought and be selfish?' <br> So why do they dislike my metaphor of a living earth? <br> It's very expensive to experiment with the earth - as we shall soon find out, for that's exactly what we've been doing with C02s.</p> <p><strong>rgsharp</strong><br> How would you sum up the concept of 'Gaia'?</p> <p><strong>James Lovelock:</strong><br> Gaia is a theory about the earth. It sees it as a self-regulating system. It keeps its climate and its chemistry always comfortable for whatever is the contemporary biosphere. Its major difference from older evolutionary theories such as Darwinism is that it sees organisms not just adapting to the environment, but changing it as well.</p> <p><strong> rabbit21 </strong><br> How far do you consider the name 'Gaia' to be responsible for the popular attraction to your theory? Equally, how far do you consider the name to be responsible for popular misunderstanding of the theory?</p> <p><strong>James Lovelock:</strong><br> Folk need a good metaphor and 'Gaia' has helped establish herself by her nice short name. <br> Naturally, many academic scientists do not like this way of presenting science.</p> <p><strong> buttercup23 </strong> <br> If you were prime minister for a day, what would be the one law you would pass to try to restore our relationship with Gaia?</p> <p><strong>James Lovelock:</strong><br> A few years ago, I published an article in Science,the American equivalent of Nature. In it, I considered what might happen in the 21st century. Perhaps we would go on slowly getting a little more crowded and a little more polluted, but still civilisation would be much as before.

      "bodyText": "starling5 Are you prepared to accept an ethical dimension to your Gaia theory whereby all lives have equal value? Or are we, as humans, entitled to favour ourselves as we must in everyday life? James Lovelock: So far as Gaia is concerned, humans are not special. We're just another species. There is a strong ethic attached to Gaia, and that is that the species that lives well with its environment favours it for its progeny and the species that fouls the environment spoils it for its progeny and goes extinct. nsalt Your thoughts on nuclear power are refreshing. For so long it has been singled out as the evil amongst energy sources while conventional power stations the world over continue to belch their polluting gases. But there is a risk factor with nuclear power even if it's smaller than that of coal etc. Renewable fuels, particularly biomass, used locally on a small scale seem better still. Should we be putting more effort into this research? James Lovelock: Large-scale nuclear power is the only practical way that we have to solve the greenhouse gas problem. Of course we should do everything else as well including renewable fuels, windmills, but we should recognise that these are no substitute. greenday234 You probably get asked this a lot, but how did you come to know William Golding, who gave Gaia her/its name? What was he like and what did he think of the theory? James Lovelock: I knew Bill Golding as a neighbour when I lived in Wiltshire. He was a good friend and we would often talk as we walked to the village post office about half a mile away. When it was something exciting, like Gaia, we would walk well beyond the post office. He liked the theory, perhaps because he had been trained in physics as a student as well as in the arts. He said that if you would put forward a big theory about the earth, you'd better give it a good name and he would call it Gaia. We walked on for 20 minutes talking at cross-purposes because I thought he meant 'gyre' (I have no classics). Then Bill said no, I meant Gaia - the Greek goddess. jjjeremy You say that nuclear power plants may be useful in supply electricity without worsening global warming. But doesn't it take generating extra greenhouse gases to be able to build and then dispose of one nuclear power plant. A nuclear power station also has to be very big to work with a centralised power grid and we would need to build a lot of them across Europe. Wouldn't we just end up with big, inefficient plants and lots more greenhouse gases? Wouldn't it be better to decentralise the grid, build efficiency into useage and the grid, use renewables and take away the subsidies from nuclear power generation and give this to alternatives? James Lovelock: It's true that building a nuclear power plant will require a lot of concrete and release a lot of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. However, a plant runs for 50 years or more, and in that time release vastly less greenhouse gas than fossil fuel-burning power stations. I believe that in Sweden small-scale nuclear power stations have now been designed for public use. kudra What are your thoughts on the recent fuel 'crisis' and the way that it was/is being handled? James Lovelock: The public response to the recent fuel crisis appalled me. They seemed to have no idea whatsoever of the dangers that lie ahead and thought only of their immediate personal needs. I should not have been surprised because in China, with its truly powerful government, they have admitted that they cannot hold back the personal aspirations of the people where burning fossil fuels is concerned. In a survey during the Suez fuel crisis, people interviewed claimed to be prepared to pay so much for fuel that their families would be in danger of privation. They valued personal mobility above all else. This is a human characteristic. I think the Chancellor is right - you've got to be tough on this one. nisaac I think that Gaia is a great metaphor for processes in the biosphere. However, I've been disappointed to find that other ecologists instinctively recoil at the idea of the Planet Personified. Whilst they are right to argue in favour of rigorous hypothesis testing, we all need some kind of bigger picture. What do you make of this? Where is the halfway house? James Lovelock: I think the biologists fight dirty. You have to use metaphor to explain science to people. The biologists have the wonderful metaphor of the selfish gene. No one challenges them, saying 'how absurd - how could a gene take thought and be selfish?' So why do they dislike my metaphor of a living earth? It's very expensive to experiment with the earth - as we shall soon find out, for that's exactly what we've been doing with C02s. rgsharp How would you sum up the concept of 'Gaia'? James Lovelock: Gaia is a theory about the earth. It sees it as a self-regulating system. It keeps its climate and its chemistry always comfortable for whatever is the contemporary biosphere. Its major difference from older evolutionary theories such as Darwinism is that it sees organisms not just adapting to the environment, but changing it as well. rabbit21 How far do you consider the name 'Gaia' to be responsible for the popular attraction to your theory? Equally, how far do you consider the name to be responsible for popular misunderstanding of the theory? James Lovelock: Folk need a good metaphor and 'Gaia' has helped establish herself by her nice short name. Naturally, many academic scientists do not like this way of presenting science. buttercup23 If you were prime minister for a day, what would be the one law you would pass to try to restore our relationship with Gaia? James Lovelock: A few years ago, I published an article in Science,the American equivalent of Nature. In it, I considered what might happen in the 21st century. Perhaps we would go on slowly getting a little more crowded and a little more polluted, but still civilisation would be much as before. Alternatively, we could suffer any one of several catastrophes, such as a volcanic eruption no more severe than Tamboura in 1815 or Laki in Iceland in 1783. These two volcanoes put so much dust into the air that the sun's rays were enfeebled, the earth grew cool and there were two years without harvest. There were then far fewer people in the world, so there were famines, but not enough to destroy civilisation. Just imagine what would happen now. It is said that we have no more than 15-50 days' grain stocks in store at any one time. Two years makes this seem a very short time. So what can we do about it? One thing we can do is to make sure that our successors in the next Dark Age know what we did wrong and have encapsulated in a simple book all the hard-won key facts of science, philosophy, art, etc that would enable them to start the new civilisation. I would like to see the book as a primer for primary-school use to make children familiar with what our civilisation really was. It would be as well-written as the Tyndale bible and kept in every home - thus available, should disaster strike, for our successors. blackbird21 The greenhouse effect and the potential damage to the ozone layer has only entered the public consciousness in the last 10 years. With the onset of unleaded petrol and 'environmentally friendly' products, is it really a case of too little too late? James Lovelock: Too little too late? It may be too late to save civilisation, but people will survive and there will be another one. There were 30 before the present, so why should this one be so special? blackbird21 And what are your views on GM Crops, how do they fit into the gaia theory? James Lovelock: My feeling about GM crops is that we are straining at a gnat while swallowing the camel of greenhouse-gas accumulation. That's all I have time for - thanks very much and goodbye.",

      "body": "<p>When it comes to literary cuisine I've always been a believer in what Italians call 'il slow-food'. So how did I get into this position? It began, appropriately enough, in Greece. In 1991 the Greek government invited me there to help celebrate 2,500 years of Hellenic Democracy (with a few gaps). Owing to the importance of poetry in Greek, the centrepiece of the celebrations was a sumptuously hosted World Conference of Poets.</p> <p>Of this conference I chiefly remember a glorious feast of multilingual conversations. At one table on the first night a would-be Byronic poet from Scandinavia was dropping lines like \"For me the beauty of the world is concentrated in all women.\" I caught a wink from a tall Greek who seemed to be in the entourage of the Minister for Culture. \"Are you a poet too?\", I asked him. \"No, I labour in the Minister.\" \"Oh, you work in the Ministry for Culture?\" \"As I said. I labour in the Minister. I am his surgeon.\"</p> <p>In the course of the conference I made several Greek friends, and I learned from them that they were hoping to see the office of Olympic poet revived when Greece next got the Olympic Games. In fact this will not happen until 2004, as Sydney got them first.</p> <p>It then occurred to me that there was no need to wait till 2004. I had just written a book of verse on the Snowy Mountains region of Australia, more or less on commission from National Parks. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office had recently imported me to Britain to open its Breath of Fresh Air environmental conference on Britain's (still surprisingly numerous) overseas territories. That too had involved having the right poems to hand on the right themes. </p> <p>So, having proved that, on a sufficiently interesting topic, I could write more or less to order, I felt bold enough to put forward my name. I talked to my friend Les Murray, another obvious candidate, who encouraged me to proceed. He remarked that he was disqualifying himself on a technicality: \"I can't stand sport.\"</p> <p>What I still needed to find was a conspicuously literate politician to take up the idea. The obvious candidate was the Premier of New South Wales, Bob Carr. He heads the State government responsible for staging the Olympics, and is also one of the most well-read politicians in the English-speaking world. Then, like a sign from the gods that this project was meant to be, I opened the Sydney Morning Herald one morning to find an article by Bob Carr titled \"My best books of the year\" - in which he praised one of my own books to the skies. </p> <p>I phoned up his minders and asked to speak to the Premier. \"Not possible,\" they said bluntly. \"Well, can I speak to Bob Carr the literary critic?\" They relented so far as to take my number. \"But don't expect anything.\" Ten minutes later the Premier phoned me back. He listened to the idea and encouraged me to proceed. </p> <p>Eventually, with his blessing the Australia Council gave me their largest fellowship - $40,000 to spend a year writing a book of verse on all aspects of the Sydney 2000 Games. The Australian media were immediately fascinated. Somehow the idea of an Olympic poet or of a poet laureate (another idea which is now being mooted for Australia) turns literature into news.</p> <p>But this brought dangers. The next day I was under the shower when the phone rang. It was the Australian Broadcasting Commission's main radio program on politics. Could I give them a poem about the topical issue of people being mailed Olympic tickets for the wrong events? And could they record it in 15 minutes? I said I'd think about it while finishing the shower...</p> <p> 'Hush! Can you hear? <br> - All over the suburbs, the roar<br> of envelopes tearing? And Yes!, at Number 10<br> It's Gold! Gold! Gold! for the Protheros! <br> They've lit a fire. They're dancing on the lawn. <br> - Not so good at Number 15. <br> The Grampolis are bit bronzed off. <br> They thrill to the shrill of the soccer ref's whistle. <br> Hard luck! It's the Lady's Nude Luge for them!<br> </p> <p>Still, writing poems under that sort of pressure was a recipe for mediocrity, and I let it be known that there would be no more \"instant\" poems.</p> <p>How do you do a year's writing on an event that is over in less than a month? One answer is to start early. The Sydney Games were preceded by the world's longest torch relay. Since these were billed as the Green Games, it made sense to follow the Olympic flame on its 100-day route round the continent. That way I could write about all the environments, human and non-human, the flame went through.</p> <p>I envisaged a leisurely experience of Australia following flame-bearing joggers who moved at 8kms an hour. The reality was different. For one thing, the flame was run only about 50 kms a day (100 runners, doing a half kilometre each). That was what the media showed.

      "bodyText": "When it comes to literary cuisine I've always been a believer in what Italians call 'il slow-food'. So how did I get into this position? It began, appropriately enough, in Greece. In 1991 the Greek government invited me there to help celebrate 2,500 years of Hellenic Democracy (with a few gaps). Owing to the importance of poetry in Greek, the centrepiece of the celebrations was a sumptuously hosted World Conference of Poets. Of this conference I chiefly remember a glorious feast of multilingual conversations. At one table on the first night a would-be Byronic poet from Scandinavia was dropping lines like \"For me the beauty of the world is concentrated in all women.\" I caught a wink from a tall Greek who seemed to be in the entourage of the Minister for Culture. \"Are you a poet too?\", I asked him. \"No, I labour in the Minister.\" \"Oh, you work in the Ministry for Culture?\" \"As I said. I labour in the Minister. I am his surgeon.\" In the course of the conference I made several Greek friends, and I learned from them that they were hoping to see the office of Olympic poet revived when Greece next got the Olympic Games. In fact this will not happen until 2004, as Sydney got them first. It then occurred to me that there was no need to wait till 2004. I had just written a book of verse on the Snowy Mountains region of Australia, more or less on commission from National Parks. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office had recently imported me to Britain to open its Breath of Fresh Air environmental conference on Britain's (still surprisingly numerous) overseas territories. That too had involved having the right poems to hand on the right themes. So, having proved that, on a sufficiently interesting topic, I could write more or less to order, I felt bold enough to put forward my name. I talked to my friend Les Murray, another obvious candidate, who encouraged me to proceed. He remarked that he was disqualifying himself on a technicality: \"I can't stand sport.\" What I still needed to find was a conspicuously literate politician to take up the idea. The obvious candidate was the Premier of New South Wales, Bob Carr. He heads the State government responsible for staging the Olympics, and is also one of the most well-read politicians in the English-speaking world. Then, like a sign from the gods that this project was meant to be, I opened the Sydney Morning Herald one morning to find an article by Bob Carr titled \"My best books of the year\" - in which he praised one of my own books to the skies. I phoned up his minders and asked to speak to the Premier. \"Not possible,\" they said bluntly. \"Well, can I speak to Bob Carr the literary critic?\" They relented so far as to take my number. \"But don't expect anything.\" Ten minutes later the Premier phoned me back. He listened to the idea and encouraged me to proceed. Eventually, with his blessing the Australia Council gave me their largest fellowship - $40,000 to spend a year writing a book of verse on all aspects of the Sydney 2000 Games. The Australian media were immediately fascinated. Somehow the idea of an Olympic poet or of a poet laureate (another idea which is now being mooted for Australia) turns literature into news. But this brought dangers. The next day I was under the shower when the phone rang. It was the Australian Broadcasting Commission's main radio program on politics. Could I give them a poem about the topical issue of people being mailed Olympic tickets for the wrong events? And could they record it in 15 minutes? I said I'd think about it while finishing the shower... 'Hush! Can you hear? - All over the suburbs, the roar of envelopes tearing? And Yes!, at Number 10 It's Gold! Gold! Gold! for the Protheros! They've lit a fire. They're dancing on the lawn. - Not so good at Number 15. The Grampolis are bit bronzed off. They thrill to the shrill of the soccer ref's whistle. Hard luck! It's the Lady's Nude Luge for them! Still, writing poems under that sort of pressure was a recipe for mediocrity, and I let it be known that there would be no more \"instant\" poems. How do you do a year's writing on an event that is over in less than a month? One answer is to start early. The Sydney Games were preceded by the world's longest torch relay. Since these were billed as the Green Games, it made sense to follow the Olympic flame on its 100-day route round the continent. That way I could write about all the environments, human and non-human, the flame went through. I envisaged a leisurely experience of Australia following flame-bearing joggers who moved at 8kms an hour. The reality was different. For one thing, the flame was run only about 50 kms a day (100 runners, doing a half kilometre each). That was what the media showed. What you didn't see was the Olympic flame sitting in first-class with a gas mantle on its head and flying like the clappers. I had to drive 5,000 kilometres for my first two sightings of the flame, one in central Australia at Uluru (Ayers Rock) near Alice Springs, and the next on the Queensland coast near Brisbane.

We'd met a few months earlier in hospital after my air crash and were married soon after. She was young, restless; I was middle-aged, semi-crocked and when she had suggested taking up the post in Cannes I had readily agreed, even though we would be living in the shadow of her former colleague - perhaps lover - Dr Greenwood, who had gone berserk while working at Eden and killed seven residents, taken three more hostage, before turning the gun on them and himself. The days passed in anomie. The super-rich kept to themselves, Jane worked 12-hour days, and I walked the trails that led nowhere. It was Halder, the black security guard, that put me on the right track. Greenwood hadn't killed the hostages; they had been his accomplices. Jane and I drifted apart. She injected herself with diamorphine and passed her evenings in the arms of Simone Delarge. I started an affair with Greenwood's former lover, Frances Baring. \"Take me into the bathroom and bugger me,\" she cooed. \"Or how about a golden shower or underage girls? Everyone else is at it here.\" It was true. I had examined Greenwood's crime scene photos and they had told a story of drugs, violence and paedophilia. He wasn't mad.

The demonstrations continued well into the night and left at least one man dead.</p> <p>Many Indonesians believe the verdict is more political than legal, and it is unclear what the fallout will be for the president, Abdurrahman Wahid, and his government. Mr Wahid's ebbing popularity had been shored up considerably by his campaign to prosecute his predecessor.</p> <p>The panel of five judges reached their decision after a team of 21 court-appointed doctors spent two-and-a-half hours explaining the results of their nine-hour examination of Mr Suharto, who was charged with embezzling almost \u00a3400m of state money through several charities he controlled.</p> <p>They concluded that while long-standing heart and other internal illnesses were not sufficiently serious to prevent Mr Suharto, 79, from attending court, his neurological and mental state made him insufficiently competent to understand the proceedings.</p> <p>\"Based on neurological and psychiatric tests, Suharto has trouble expressing himself,\" said Dr Zakaria, one of the independent team that examined him last week. \"When he speaks, he stops often and uses sign language to express himself. He cannot understand complex ideas.\"</p> <p>She described how Mr Suharto could do simple addition sums but was unable to do similarly easy subtraction.</p> <p>The chief judge, Lalu Mariyun, said the court could not accept the case against Mr Suharto. \"Therefore the case is closed,\" he said. \"And his city arrest status is lifted.\"</p> <p>Judge Mariyun also refused to accept a prosecution appeal to the supreme court to try Mr Suharto in absentia. \"What the doctors have said is clear and final,\" he said. \"Nothing the supreme court might say changes that.\"</p> <p>Mr Suharto's defence team was predictably delighted by the verdict. \"This vindicates what we have been saying all along,\" said one lawyer, Mohammed Assegaf. \"As far as we are concerned the case is now over.\"</p> <p>Mr Wahid, who is on a tour of South America, was unavailable for comment.</p> <p>The attorney general, Marzuki Darusman, said he was extremely disappointed by the verdict and would attempt an appeal. \"I just want to say that the thing which we aimed for, which was to truly obtain justice for the people, was not achieved,\" he said.</p> <p>For months Mr Darusman insisted that Mr Suharto, who critics say stole more than \u00a330bn while in office, was healthy enough to stand trial.</p> <p>Hundreds of anti-Suharto protesters who had gathered outside the court agreed. \"Suharto is [smarter] than the doctors,\" said a student, Ali Markus. \"He knows how to trick them. He should be brought before a special people's court.\"</p> <p>Scores of riot police blocked the demonstrators from reaching the court. After a bus carrying pro-Suharto demonstrators was burned, the officers charged the protesters, firing tear-gas canisters, rubber bullets and live ammunition.</p> <p>Police said one person was killed and more than a dozen were taken to hospital, one of whom was shot with a tear-gas canister at point-blank range and beaten up.</p> <p>The protesters retreated and about 2,000 gathered later in the afternoon near Mr Suharto's home. Scores of heavily armed police blocked the roads to the residence and then tried to surround the demonstrators.</p> <p>As darkness fell, the running battles began, with the demonstrators throwing rocks and petrol bombs and the police responding with tear gas, rubber bullets and the odd live round. The police became increasingly brutal as the night wore on, threatening journalists and innocent bystanders. Many protesters who were caught were shown little mercy.</p> <p>While the authorities' attempt to prosecute Mr Suharto might be over, they are still determined to get his six children. Mr Suharto's youngest son, Tommy, was convicted last Friday of defrauding the state of \u00a37.7m in a land-swap deal.</p> <p>He was sentenced to 18 months in jail and is to be imprisoned in the next two days.</p>",

The panel of five judges reached their decision after a team of 21 court-appointed doctors spent two-and-a-half hours explaining the results of their nine-hour examination of Mr Suharto, who was charged with embezzling almost \u00a3400m of state money through several charities he controlled. They concluded that while long-standing heart and other internal illnesses were not sufficiently serious to prevent Mr Suharto, 79, from attending court, his neurological and mental state made him insufficiently competent to understand the proceedings. \"Based on neurological and psychiatric tests, Suharto has trouble expressing himself,\" said Dr Zakaria, one of the independent team that examined him last week. \"When he speaks, he stops often and uses sign language to express himself. He cannot understand complex ideas.\" She described how Mr Suharto could do simple addition sums but was unable to do similarly easy subtraction. The chief judge, Lalu Mariyun, said the court could not accept the case against Mr Suharto. \"Therefore the case is closed,\" he said. \"And his city arrest status is lifted.\" Judge Mariyun also refused to accept a prosecution appeal to the supreme court to try Mr Suharto in absentia. \"What the doctors have said is clear and final,\" he said. \"Nothing the supreme court might say changes that.\" Mr Suharto's defence team was predictably delighted by the verdict. \"This vindicates what we have been saying all along,\" said one lawyer, Mohammed Assegaf. \"As far as we are concerned the case is now over.\" Mr Wahid, who is on a tour of South America, was unavailable for comment. The attorney general, Marzuki Darusman, said he was extremely disappointed by the verdict and would attempt an appeal. \"I just want to say that the thing which we aimed for, which was to truly obtain justice for the people, was not achieved,\" he said. For months Mr Darusman insisted that Mr Suharto, who critics say stole more than \u00a330bn while in office, was healthy enough to stand trial. Hundreds of anti-Suharto protesters who had gathered outside the court agreed. \"Suharto is [smarter] than the doctors,\" said a student, Ali Markus. \"He knows how to trick them. He should be brought before a special people's court.\" Scores of riot police blocked the demonstrators from reaching the court. After a bus carrying pro-Suharto demonstrators was burned, the officers charged the protesters, firing tear-gas canisters, rubber bullets and live ammunition. Police said one person was killed and more than a dozen were taken to hospital, one of whom was shot with a tear-gas canister at point-blank range and beaten up. The protesters retreated and about 2,000 gathered later in the afternoon near Mr Suharto's home. Scores of heavily armed police blocked the roads to the residence and then tried to surround the demonstrators. As darkness fell, the running battles began, with the demonstrators throwing rocks and petrol bombs and the police responding with tear gas, rubber bullets and the odd live round. The police became increasingly brutal as the night wore on, threatening journalists and innocent bystanders. Many protesters who were caught were shown little mercy. While the authorities' attempt to prosecute Mr Suharto might be over, they are still determined to get his six children. Mr Suharto's youngest son, Tommy, was convicted last Friday of defrauding the state of \u00a37.7m in a land-swap deal. He was sentenced to 18 months in jail and is to be imprisoned in the next two days.",

But we British, it seems, have lost our appetite for that meal. </p> <p>Hounded by pressure of the workplace, terrified of being seen to waste time, subservient to the business practices of the Americans, we have given up on lunch. According to a survey by Datamonitor reported this week, we spend an average of 38 minutes and a miserable \u00a31.99 to scrabble the wodge and stodge that pass for food into our mouths as we twitch at each passing second. </p> <p>Quite aside from the disastrous consequences for the nation's health - as we all know stress and inadequate diet pile up the coronaries, back complaints and nervous breakdowns - it is bad for business. Without adequate nutrition (and, ideally, the nap that should come after), we lose concentration, become tired more easily, and lose our temper with our co-workers, who have, of course, already lost their temper with us. And all that motivates this lemming-like rush to self-destruction is fear. </p> <p>It is no coincidence that the height of Britain's power, self-confidence and productivity coincided with the height of lunch. The Victorians were mighty eaters. Five courses for lunch? No problem. A reasonable man could easily manage six or seven, and then go back to work before stuffing away a similar - if not a greater - number of dishes with accompanying wines in the evening. </p> <p>You might argue that they didn't live that long as a result. Perhaps that's true, but neither did they die of stress or whinge about their bad backs either. </p> <p>The Victorians, and to an even greater extent the Edwardians, appreciated the value of the rituals of lunch.

If the sole justification for lunch came from topping up with fuel for the day, there would be no reason for continuing its practice at all. A simple injection or pill would serve just as well. </p> <p>No, the lunch table is a forum for social exchange, for communication and discussion. The lunch table is a neutral zone in the warfare of the workplace. Quite apart from the refreshing rest from the pressures of business that a break for lunch represents, it is also the means by which we come to a better understanding of the people we work with or those with whom we wish to do business. Lunch represents the opportunity to extend relationships beyond the mere mechanics of deals and decision-making to embrace the dynamics of human behaviour. You're never likely to learn those by stuffing sandwiches at your desk. </p> <p>Besides, lunching has a civilising effect on even the most obdurate of opponents. It is a little publicised footnote to the Paris negotiations that led to the end of the Vietnam war that several of the key sessions were held over lunch. As an American spokesman admitted ruefully at the time: \"It is more difficult to threaten to bomb someone back into the Stone Age when you have just passed them the salt.\" </p> <p>Perhaps we shouldn't be surprised by the lapsing of lunch. It's just another casualty in a general degradation in the national rituals of eating. Who eats tea any more? Whither elevenses and high tea? Fewer and fewer people, it seems, have the time or the inclination to sit down and eat together, whether at work or at home. But the abandonment of lunch as a serious activity has had social consequences quite as serious as those affecting health and commerce. </p> <p>The sharp rise in divorce in this country can be attributed, in part at least, to the loss of lunch.

Pi director Darren Aronofsky (currently enjoying festival success with Requiem for a Dream) will be scripting and directing the caped crusader's fifth cinematic outing (see <a href=\"http://www.filmunlimited.co.uk/News_Story/Exclusive/0,,371827,00.html\">our story</a>), but he told America's TV Guide that Pitt will not be involved. \"The media put two and two together and got seven,\" he said, explaining that he and Pitt had indeed been spotted around Tinseltown but were discussing an entirely different matter. \"I did meet with Brad, but we were actually talking about the science fiction [film] that I'm writing,\" he says. \"[Pitt] had seen Requiem for a Dream and really dug it, and wanted to meet me. The word 'Batman' didn't even come up.\"</p> <p>\u0095 A poll by magazine Total Film names Monty Python's <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Title?0079470\">The Life of Brian</a> (pictured) the funniest film ever. The 1979 Python film was originally banned in various parts of Britain and America due to what was deemed its offensively blasphemous content. Leslie Nielsen's Airplane (1980) came a close second.</p> <p>\u0095 Cinematographer <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Name?Storaro,+Vittorio\">Vittorio Storaro</a>, whose credits include Apocalypse Now, The Last Emperor, and Reds, is to be honoured by the American Society of Cinematographers with its Lifetime Achievement Award. Storaro's work is most closely associated with Bernardo Bertolucci, with whom he worked on The Last Tango in Paris and The Sheltering Sky. Director Francis Ford Coppola will present the award at the cinematographer's gala banquet on February 18.</p> <p>\u0095 <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Name?Jackson,+Samuel+L.\">Samuel L Jackson</a> could find himself on the wrong side of Merseysiders (definitely the wrong place to be). The star, who is due in Liverpool to film 51st State alongside Robert Carlyle, is apparently refusing to stay in the fragrant sea-port. Jackson has elected to reside in the more salubrious surroundings of Southport - a 40-minute drive from the set.</p> <p>\u0095 News of the weird: A UFO expert is investigating claims from various American women that they have been ravished by aliens - who look like Leonardo DiCaprio. Investigator Donald Worley said that one woman, Diana, from Missouri, claimed the space Casanova made her cheat on her husband - but it was \"sex beyond anything on earth\".</p> <p>\u0095 America's Star magazine suggests that <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Name?Cox,+Courteney\">Courteney Cox</a> and David Arquette's 15-month marriage is on the rocks. A so-called friend of the pair said: \"It's not a question of there being anyone else involved, it's a case of two huge battling egos. They were in a restaurant just weeks ago and couldn't stop sniping at each other. </p> <p>\u0095 <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Name?Crowe,+Russell\">Russell Crowe</a> has apparently taken Meg Ryan home to Australia to meet his parents. The pair boarded separate flights to Australia and hid out at his secluded ranch outside the New South Wales town of Grafton. Said a friend: \"Russell couldn't wait for the woman he loves to meet the parents he adores. It's a confirmation that he and Meg are serious about each other and wedding bells will be ringing as soon as her divorce from Dennis Quaid comes through.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "\u0095 It seems that reports that Brad Pitt would be easing himself into the batmobile were premature. Pi director Darren Aronofsky (currently enjoying festival success with Requiem for a Dream) will be scripting and directing the caped crusader's fifth cinematic outing (see our story), but he told America's TV Guide that Pitt will not be involved. \"The media put two and two together and got seven,\" he said, explaining that he and Pitt had indeed been spotted around Tinseltown but were discussing an entirely different matter. \"I did meet with Brad, but we were actually talking about the science fiction [film] that I'm writing,\" he says. \"[Pitt] had seen Requiem for a Dream and really dug it, and wanted to meet me. The word 'Batman' didn't even come up.\" \u0095 A poll by magazine Total Film names Monty Python's The Life of Brian (pictured) the funniest film ever. The 1979 Python film was originally banned in various parts of Britain and America due to what was deemed its offensively blasphemous content. Leslie Nielsen's Airplane (1980) came a close second. \u0095 Cinematographer Vittorio Storaro, whose credits include Apocalypse Now, The Last Emperor, and Reds, is to be honoured by the American Society of Cinematographers with its Lifetime Achievement Award. Storaro's work is most closely associated with Bernardo Bertolucci, with whom he worked on The Last Tango in Paris and The Sheltering Sky. Director Francis Ford Coppola will present the award at the cinematographer's gala banquet on February 18. \u0095 Samuel L Jackson could find himself on the wrong side of Merseysiders (definitely the wrong place to be). The star, who is due in Liverpool to film 51st State alongside Robert Carlyle, is apparently refusing to stay in the fragrant sea-port. Jackson has elected to reside in the more salubrious surroundings of Southport - a 40-minute drive from the set. \u0095 News of the weird: A UFO expert is investigating claims from various American women that they have been ravished by aliens - who look like Leonardo DiCaprio. Investigator Donald Worley said that one woman, Diana, from Missouri, claimed the space Casanova made her cheat on her husband - but it was \"sex beyond anything on earth\". \u0095 America's Star magazine suggests that Courteney Cox and David Arquette's 15-month marriage is on the rocks. A so-called friend of the pair said: \"It's not a question of there being anyone else involved, it's a case of two huge battling egos. They were in a restaurant just weeks ago and couldn't stop sniping at each other. \u0095 Russell Crowe has apparently taken Meg Ryan home to Australia to meet his parents. The pair boarded separate flights to Australia and hid out at his secluded ranch outside the New South Wales town of Grafton. Said a friend: \"Russell couldn't wait for the woman he loves to meet the parents he adores. It's a confirmation that he and Meg are serious about each other and wedding bells will be ringing as soon as her divorce from Dennis Quaid comes through.\"",

      "bodyText": "New details of the army's reactions to Bloody Sunday in Londonderry emerged last night after the IRA leaked a tape-recording, purportedly of conversations in a security force communications centre in the city in the aftermath of the massacre. The IRA has long claimed that for several years it bugged the room in the now-defunct Victoria Barracks in the city. But there was no explanation last night why the critical recording was passed to the Derry Journal only after more than 28 years. According to conversations between security force personnel captured on tape, General Robert Ford, then deputy commanding officer in Northern Ireland, was jubilant at the outcome. Three weeks before Bloody Sunday he had recommended shooting selected ringleaders of the youths who regularly rioted in the city. The Parachute regiment shot dead 13 unarmed Catholics on an illegal civil rights demonstration in Derry on January 30 1972. Another man who was injured died several months later, and the tape will fuel suspicions that the soldiers' actions were pre-meditated. One man recorded in the communication rooms says to another: \"Look there's obviously been a hell of a sort out ... The whole thing's in chaos ... yeah, obviously I think it's gone badly wrong in the Rossville ... the doctor's just been up the hospital and they're pulling the stiffs out there as fast as they can get them out.\" Another replies: \"There's nothing wrong with that, Alan.\" The first man says: \"Well, there is because they're the wrong people ...

But it is expected the tape and its transcript, which runs to 25 pages, will be passed to Lord Saville's inquiry before it re-opens in December. There are references in it to the \"beautiful picture\" of a priest over a man lying dead on the ground; to longstanding allegations rioters brought out an already dead body, of a girl, falsely to boost casualty rates, and examples of black humour in the room.

Speaking on Radio 4's Today programme Mr Portillo said the result of the Danish referendum proved there was nothing inevitable about joining the single currency. \"I think there has been an important change with this referendum, and that is that the only arguments that were really made in favour about going in, were that we should be fearful in some way of being left out, fearful of being isolated,\" he said. \"Well of course we are not now isolated, other people in Europe have taken the same view. \"The other argument was that it was somehow inevitable that we would join the euro. Well, it clearly isn't inevitable. It is within the capability of the British people to vote no if they are offered that chance in a referendum.\"",

      "bodyText": "Denmark last night said a resounding No to the euro after a cliffhanging referendum whose result will narrow Tony Blair's choices over the single currency and encourage the development of a \"two-speed\" Europe, leaving Britain in the slow lane. With 99% of votes counted, TV projections showed 53% against and 47% for, promising a comfortable final majority for jubilant nej-sayers. The result immediately echoed across the EU and beyond, with the euro starting to drop in late trading in New York. Romano Prodi, the president of the European Commission, did his best to put a brave face on the outcome but had to admit that he was disappointed. \"The EU is obviously not happy about this result but it will continue on its path which has produced exceptional results,\" he said last night. \"I don't think the Danish economy will in future benefit from this decision.\" In an aside which is certain to anger Tony Blair, Mr Prodi seemed to signal that the Danish vote may now open the way to something which Britain vehemently opposes - a two-speed Europe in which a small core of so-called pioneer countries race ahead of the laggards who cannot make up their minds. Reinforced cooperation as it is called is now very much on the cards, he suggested, but he was at pains to stress that this was not an exclusive club and that membership was open to all. Mr Blair insisted that the knife-edge decision of the 4m deeply divided Danish voters would not affect his long-standing policy on the euro. \"Denmark has got its own decision and we have got our own decision,\" he said. But the Conservative leader, William Hague,said: \"This vote blows out of the water Labour's scare tactics on the euro. \"They claimed that Britain would be isolated if we keep the pound. We are not.

Denmark's big day followed a six-month campaign that saw little argument about the economic merits of joining the euro but much discussion of deep-seated anxieties about the erosion of national identity and independence. By lunchtime, crowds were streaming past Copenhagen's famous Tivoli gardens and into the capital's town hall to vote. Emerging from a polling booth, economist and Yes voter Soren Voetmann said: \"I have tried to use common sense and not my emotions. There has been too much emotion.\" But Christen Thrane, 23, a young mother, was against. \"It's too fast and I am not sure what we are getting into,\" she said. \"It's important that we keep our Danish money and I fear adopting the euro will damage our social welfare system.\" Danes were voting whether to keep their opt-out from the 1993 Maastricht treaty, negotiated after a referendum in 1992 rejected the entire single currency project.

The home secretary, Jack Straw, who heads the government's fuel taskforce, was set to publish details of the agreement after it was formally endorsed by ministers and representatives of the industry and the police. In a statement to the House of Lords yesterday, transport minister Lord Macdonald said it would cover the practical arrangements for the co-ordination and co-operation needed to protect essential services. Government sources said it would include the development of joint early-warning and crisis-management systems, as well as dealing with the intimidation of tanker drivers. The taskforce had also been looking at the oil companies' contractual arrangements with the tanker drivers, most of whom are self-employed, which made it difficult for the companies to order them to cross the blockades. The taskforce was also looking at the options for new legislation, giving the police greater powers to deal with public disorder and imposing a legal duty on the oil companies to maintain essential supplies. Lord Macdonald stressed, however, that the government would continue to respect workers' rights under employment legislation as well as the right to peaceful protest. He emphasised that ministers, who had faced accusations that they were arrogant and out of touch, were listening to the concerns of the protesters. The \"existing channels\" of communication with the haulage industry would be kept open during the consultation process, leading up to the pre-Budget report from the chancellor, Gordon Brown, Lord Macdonald said. But he warned that the government would not be dictated to by the protesters, who have threatened to resume their blockades if there was no cut in fuel duty within 60 days.",

In his first ever interview with a British newspaper, Zardari, the husband of the former Pakistani prime minister, denies corruption but says he did behave 'improperly'. He graphically describes being tortured in custody but avoids any direct criticism of the military regime and says he misses his wife, in self-imposed exile in London.</b> <p><b>Harding:</b><br> Mr Zardari, you recently spent your 47th birthday in custody. How have you coped with three years in prison and enforced separation from your wife and family?</p> <p><b>Zardari:</b><br> I turned 46 in July and it was my fourth consecutive birthday in prison. I have spent seven of the 12 years I have been married a victim of political persecution. I must be the first male spouse being held hostage by a regime. I accept this as Pakistan has traditional elements who find it hard to reconcile with a man whose wife works and who other men salute perforce of her office. It is difficult to cope without the company of my wife and children, my family and friends. I miss the joy of a father in seeing his children grow, the opportunity to walk in the garden, to visit the dust and heat of my constituency Nawabshah, to meet with members of my tribe and my political colleagues, to laugh with my friends, to visit a shop and buy a magazine or compete in a polo match. As an independent person, I find it difficult being dependent for everything, for even my food and medicine, to the prison authorities. I have had to fight through the courts for everything, including even physiotherapy which is my right under the jail manual.</p> <p>When I married, many warned me of the difficulties that would come my way. However, I greatly admired my father in law, prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. I draw inspiration by thinking of him and the greater difficulties he endured. I think of the PPP workers lashed and sent to the gallows. I want our martyrs and our workers to be proud of me in that I upheld the legacy of a great party committed to upholding human dignity. I pray to God to give me the courage to face the hardship and the humiliation that comes with prison life and the false accusations made against me.</p> <p><b>Harding:</b><br> It is claimed that your prison life is luxurious. Could you describe your surroundings and what comforts- if any - you have?</p> <p><b>Zardari:</b><br> It is incorrect that my prison life is luxurious. As a child I was spoilt by my parents as an only son. They indulged my every whim and I grew up in luxury. My prison cell is a far cry from that luxury. It is spartan and particularly difficult during the hot summer months. Most of the time I have been in physical pain caused by the increasing nerve compression aggravated through neglected medical treatment. The courts freed me on medical bail two years back, but the regime opposed it. Solitary confinement makes it difficult for time to pass. Over the years, I won some bare improvements through many petitions and court proceedings through various high courts. These included a cooler after one year, a radio/television after eighteen months. Other prisoners have generous visiting rights and other facilities such as mixing with each other to pass the time as a matter of entitlement. These entitlements have been denied to me despite order of courts. I felt discriminated against.</p> <p><b>Harding:</b><br> Several charges of corruption have been levelled against you, yet no charges have been proved. Do you accept any of the allegations made and are you confident you will eventually receive a fair trial?</p> <p><b>Zardari:</b><br> The charges of corruption against me are baseless. I never broke a single law nor exploited my wife's position. It was the practice for chief executives to favour their families. General Zia gave prime property to his sons and even sons in law in Islamabad and Rawalpindi. Prime minister Junejo gave his son a sugar mill at the concessional rate of three per cent. Prime Minister Jatoi also gave his family members prime property in Islamabad. Prime minister Nawaz Sharif took loans from public sector banks to make about 30 factories. President Leghari got back 40,000 acres of land during his presidentship and reportedly assisted his family members in bank loans. My wife should be credited with breaking from that tradition. I neither took a loan, nor prime property nor influenced the award of contracts.</p> <p>Before my marriage I was a businessman in trading, construction and hotelling. As the spouse of the prime minister, I refused even credit from public sector banks, borrowing instead from the markets. I had money and was more interested in the political success of the PPP. I may have behaved improperly in being extravagant or in allowing access to friends to the prime minister's house. However, I scrupulously adhered to the law of the land. In future, I will be more careful than in the past in allowing access as I have learnt many bitter lessons and realise that the prime minister's spouse must be above suspicion. Even if there isn't a fire, smoke makes people suspicious and I end up paying the price.</p> <p>I would like the so-called charges against me put up for scrutiny before independent jurists or chartered accountants. The documents before the court placed by the prosecution are enough to show the total lack of evidence. They fail the test of evidentiary admissibility and show how an attempt has been made to pervert the course of justice. Reputed Queens Counsel from Britain has opined that I did not get a fair (trial) in the SGS case [Societe General de Suisse, a corruption case last year] in which a mistrial took place. The case is currently under appeal. I hope interested observers will come to witness the proceedings. </p> <p>My whole family was made to suffer. My father was arrested, my sister's house raided in the early hours of the morning, my wife dragged from court room to court room, my brother in law arrested eight consecutive times, my secretary tortured until one eye was permanently damaged, my former bodyguards tortured and imprisoned. I too was subjected to military torture under the directions of President Leghari and to police torture under Nawaz Sharif where my neck and throat were cut in a bid to make me implicate my wife. I was taken to the hospital when it was presumed I would die from cardiac arrest. I feel God has given me a second life. I want to live up to the new standards of transparency and openness which the youth of today demand of their leaders.</p> <p><b>Harding:</b><br> Your friends say you have not been well recently. Could you describe what health problems you have suffered and why?</p> <p><b>Zardari:</b><br> I suffer from spinal problems which have worsened through imprisonment. The lack of proper treatment has led to further nerve compression and I have lost weight as a consequence. My eyes have also suffered due to the long nights when I was made to stand under blazing lights and denied sleep. I would be woken at odd times in the night to be taken to airports in overheated armoured vehicles. The pain from the spinal problem and the disorientation of being denied sleep and proper medical attention led to hypertension and I am in need of specialised treatment. The supreme court of Pakistan has observed that I can only be treated properly in hospital and not in prison. Had I been given proper medical treatment in the first place then my health would not have suffered so badly. Again the denial of such treatment was a continuation of the government policy of victimising me.</p> <p><b>Harding:</b><br> Like you, Nawaz Sharif is now in prison. Do you have any sympathy for the former prime minister and what is your opinion of Pakistan's new military regime?</p> <p><b>Zardari:</b><br> Mr Nawaz Sharif dug his own grave by taking on the PPP in a fascist fashion. Murder cases were trumped up against me, as well as other charges, and I was threatened with a death sentence many times over through special laws and special terrorist courts. Ironically, Nawaz Sharif was tried by the same laws he had made against me, tried through the precedent of different provincial jurisdictions that he had made for my party, put in the same prison cell, threatened with a death sentence by the terrorist courts he had made for me and made to travel in the same armoured personnel carrier. </p> <p>His trial venue was in front of my residence Bilawal House which he had to pass every day. He had wanted the army to try me and hang me but I fought it to the supreme court and in a way saved Nawaz Sharif's life. When he was overthrown he was spared being tried by an army officer. Now he is even turning to the lawyers which had been defending me to defend him. I hope that Nawaz Sharif emerges as a better person through the prison ordeal as he is now paying the price of what he did to others. </p> <p>Whilst I was personally tortured and nearly poisoned by the Sharif brothers, I am a political animal and as such would like to look at the political concept rather than the inhuman treatment meted out to me. I believe it is wrong to prejudge and criminalise political leaders and deny them the due process of law. Therefore, the treatment being meted out to Nawaz Sharif, my party colleagues, other political leaders and to myself is one which I find hard to accept.</p> <p>I do feel sad when I see Mrs Kulsoom Sharif going from city to city. Pakistan is a country where women are revered and respected as sisters and mothers. Our country is shamed when its rulers refuse to show respect even for our mothers and daughters irrespective of political differences.</p> <p>As far as the military regime is concerned, it has yet to make any new cases against me. It has not carried out a media campaign of vilification or taken out advertisements in the newspapers against me.</p> <p>Whilst it has denied me any relief despite calling the last accountability politically motivated, it has not added to the mountain of persecution launched by the previous regime.</p> <p>I went to a cadet college for my education and I admire the discipline, determination and professionalism which an army officer brings to his job. However, the army is taught to defend a country not govern it. I would like to see the generals discuss an exit strategy to go back to the barracks. The situation in the country is much as it was under Nawaz Sharif. The declaration of building the Kalabagh Dam can only alienate the smaller provinces further as their elected assemblies have rejected it.</p> <p><b>Harding:</b><br> The British builder Paul Keating claims he met you on several occasions to supervise the refurbishment of Rockwood House, a mansion in Surrey. Did you ever meet Paul Keating and does Rockwood House belong to you? If not, do you have any objection to the property being used by the Pakistan High Commission in London?</p> <p><b>Zardari:</b><br> I wonder how this question is relevant to the accusations of corruption against me. Even if the prosecution story is accepted that the Surrey House belongs to me, which is unproved in a court of law in Pakistan, I am a businessman with my own sources of income. The regime has to show that I did a corrupt act and bought a property through a corrupt act. Instead the regime wrongly claimed I was in the narcotics trade and bought a house with that. </p> <p>The co-accused in the narcotics case have judicially declared that they were tortured to make the statements against me which they have withdrawn before the judge. I come from a respectable and old family. My father is the head of Zardari tribe and I am his only son. My family has been landowners for a long time with our family mausoleum going back one millennium. We are involved in construction and trading with expensive properties in the heart of Karachi. During the Zia era, the Zardari Group won a contract for a hotel in Rawalpindi near the golf course, a prime property. </p> <p>Our business has suffered setbacks due to my incarceration and that of my father. I have been in prison for seven years of my 12 years of marriage. Before I got married, I had my private polo team and led a privileged life. I have faced hardship over privilege with dignity despite the special laws and special courts constituted to persecute me due to my martial status. I was kidnapped from prison and physically tortured and nearly killed in 1999. Under Farooq Leghari, in December 1996, I was given sleep deprivation torture, [light] was shone in my eyes despite my having undergone an eye operation. I have borne the hardship because I am fighting for my reputation, that of my family, tribe, province and country. To err is human but I have never broken the laws.</p> <p><b>Harding:</b><br> Are you able to communicate with your wife at all, either by phone or letter? How demoralising is it for you that she is unable presently to return to Pakistan?</p> <p><b>Zardari:</b><br> I do try and communicate with my wife and children by sending them flowers and cards with short messages. I receive letters from them and even poetry from my children which is read to me during the court break and always cheers me enormously. Absence only makes the heart grow fonder. I sometimes ask for photos to be sent to me so that I can see what they look like and how they are growing. I do miss the children. I am a Balauch. When I was young I was told that Balauch fathers do not see their children when they are young because the children can become the weakness of a strong man. I have not seen my children much but they are still my weakness. I try not to think of my wife and children because when I do I become sentimental.</p> <p><b>Harding:</b><br> Do you think the PPP will be able to recover from its current setbacks and do you think you and your wife might have a role to play in government when democracy is restored to Pakistan?</p> <p><b>Zardari:</b><br> Yes, I do think the PPP will recover from its current setbacks. When my wife was here, she would tell me how the party was discussing remodelling itself on the lines of New Labour to win back those supporters who had become disenchanted.

The support of the people for the PPP is evident in labour elections, bar elections, community meetings and other forums.

      "bodyText": "This is the full text of an interview by the Guardian's Asia correspondent Luke Harding with Benazir Bhutto's millionaire husband Asif Ali Zardari, who has spent the last three years in jail in Pakistan on corruption charges and faces a fresh trial in connection with Rockwood Park, a mansion in Surrey which the authorities say he bought using drug money. In his first ever interview with a British newspaper, Zardari, the husband of the former Pakistani prime minister, denies corruption but says he did behave 'improperly'. He graphically describes being tortured in custody but avoids any direct criticism of the military regime and says he misses his wife, in self-imposed exile in London. Harding: Mr Zardari, you recently spent your 47th birthday in custody. How have you coped with three years in prison and enforced separation from your wife and family? Zardari: I turned 46 in July and it was my fourth consecutive birthday in prison. I have spent seven of the 12 years I have been married a victim of political persecution. I must be the first male spouse being held hostage by a regime. I accept this as Pakistan has traditional elements who find it hard to reconcile with a man whose wife works and who other men salute perforce of her office. It is difficult to cope without the company of my wife and children, my family and friends. I miss the joy of a father in seeing his children grow, the opportunity to walk in the garden, to visit the dust and heat of my constituency Nawabshah, to meet with members of my tribe and my political colleagues, to laugh with my friends, to visit a shop and buy a magazine or compete in a polo match. As an independent person, I find it difficult being dependent for everything, for even my food and medicine, to the prison authorities. I have had to fight through the courts for everything, including even physiotherapy which is my right under the jail manual. When I married, many warned me of the difficulties that would come my way. However, I greatly admired my father in law, prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. I draw inspiration by thinking of him and the greater difficulties he endured. I think of the PPP workers lashed and sent to the gallows. I want our martyrs and our workers to be proud of me in that I upheld the legacy of a great party committed to upholding human dignity. I pray to God to give me the courage to face the hardship and the humiliation that comes with prison life and the false accusations made against me. Harding: It is claimed that your prison life is luxurious. Could you describe your surroundings and what comforts- if any - you have? Zardari: It is incorrect that my prison life is luxurious. As a child I was spoilt by my parents as an only son. They indulged my every whim and I grew up in luxury. My prison cell is a far cry from that luxury. It is spartan and particularly difficult during the hot summer months. Most of the time I have been in physical pain caused by the increasing nerve compression aggravated through neglected medical treatment. The courts freed me on medical bail two years back, but the regime opposed it. Solitary confinement makes it difficult for time to pass. Over the years, I won some bare improvements through many petitions and court proceedings through various high courts. These included a cooler after one year, a radio/television after eighteen months. Other prisoners have generous visiting rights and other facilities such as mixing with each other to pass the time as a matter of entitlement. These entitlements have been denied to me despite order of courts. I felt discriminated against. Harding: Several charges of corruption have been levelled against you, yet no charges have been proved. Do you accept any of the allegations made and are you confident you will eventually receive a fair trial? Zardari: The charges of corruption against me are baseless. I never broke a single law nor exploited my wife's position. It was the practice for chief executives to favour their families. General Zia gave prime property to his sons and even sons in law in Islamabad and Rawalpindi. Prime minister Junejo gave his son a sugar mill at the concessional rate of three per cent.

      "body": "<p><strong>Big Brother special ingredients Part I</strong> <br> Monkey noted at Victoria Real's post-Big Brother party that when it comes to debauchery, digital types are outdoing their meeja counterparts. The dancefloor antics of Brighton's answer to Bez, Jason George, were exceeded only by the increasingly numerous and enthusiastic trips to the luxury mobile toilets by court jester in residence Paul Munford. <strong>Big Brother special ingredients Part II</strong> <br> Now that everyone is attempting closure on Big Brother, it's time to set the record straight. One rumour that was confirmed by web stalwarts at the Big Brother house party on Thursday was the one doing the rounds at the start of the show's run about Randy Andy's secret rising ingredient for bread. Seems Andy's little trip to the lavvie during a bread kneading session resulted in more than just yeast been added to the dough. The impudent Jack the lad didn't even bother to wash his hands and innocently sat back, relishing in watching his housemates devour the fruits of his monkey spanking. This innocent Monkey is, quite rightly, speechless. <strong>Not quite all over for Wembley commentator</strong> <br> The man who coined the immortal phrase \"They think it\u00b9s all over...\" really did think Wembley was going to be all over without him. Kenneth Wolstenholme, commentator at the historic 1966 England World Cup victory at Wembley over Germany, hadn't been invited to the England-Germany match next Saturday, the final game before the stadium is demolished. Now Sport First has hired the game's most memorable voice to write about the last match. What a joy, says Kenneth. Well, it is now! <strong>What's in a suffix?</strong><br> Associated New Media finally came clean with its plans and new name for lead balloon CharlotteStreet.com this week, scotching rumours that it was going to launch you.co.uk. Instead we're to get femail.co.uk and rumour has it this new strategy of using the mail suffix will be applied to a number of Associated New Media websites. Staunch Royalist The Mail is said to be keen to develop a site devoted to that bastion of British culture, the Royal family (no, not the TV programme) but unfortunately for The Mail, a certain carrier of letters has already had the foresight to register royalmail.co.uk. Keen checkers of domain name registrations however, will be aware that Associated has already registered travelmail.co.uk, shopmail.co.uk, moneymail.co.uk and financialmail.co.uk. In fact the only one that is still available is showbizmail.co.uk - better snap it up quick. BR&gt; <strong>Yawning risers</strong><br> As the battle of the breakfast bulletins shapes up, it's nice to know GMTV isn't straying too far from its roots. Monkey understands that a well-known ballerina, whose agents approached the network offering an exclusive interview, was turned down on the grounds that \"ballet dancers are too upmarket for us. They turn off our viewers\". <strong>It came from the stalker</strong><br> Sophie Raworth, the pretty half of the BBC's new breakfast team, has caused quite a stir among blue-chip types. Eyebrows were raised at BBC news after she was found to have a website set up by a celebrity stalker. And it gets worse.

The dancefloor antics of Brighton's answer to Bez, Jason George, were exceeded only by the increasingly numerous and enthusiastic trips to the luxury mobile toilets by court jester in residence Paul Munford. Big Brother special ingredients Part II Now that everyone is attempting closure on Big Brother, it's time to set the record straight. One rumour that was confirmed by web stalwarts at the Big Brother house party on Thursday was the one doing the rounds at the start of the show's run about Randy Andy's secret rising ingredient for bread. Seems Andy's little trip to the lavvie during a bread kneading session resulted in more than just yeast been added to the dough. The impudent Jack the lad didn't even bother to wash his hands and innocently sat back, relishing in watching his housemates devour the fruits of his monkey spanking. This innocent Monkey is, quite rightly, speechless. Not quite all over for Wembley commentator The man who coined the immortal phrase \"They think it\u00b9s all over...\" really did think Wembley was going to be all over without him. Kenneth Wolstenholme, commentator at the historic 1966 England World Cup victory at Wembley over Germany, hadn't been invited to the England-Germany match next Saturday, the final game before the stadium is demolished. Now Sport First has hired the game's most memorable voice to write about the last match. What a joy, says Kenneth. Well, it is now! What's in a suffix? Associated New Media finally came clean with its plans and new name for lead balloon CharlotteStreet.com this week, scotching rumours that it was going to launch you.co.uk. Instead we're to get femail.co.uk and rumour has it this new strategy of using the mail suffix will be applied to a number of Associated New Media websites. Staunch Royalist The Mail is said to be keen to develop a site devoted to that bastion of British culture, the Royal family (no, not the TV programme) but unfortunately for The Mail, a certain carrier of letters has already had the foresight to register royalmail.co.uk. Keen checkers of domain name registrations however, will be aware that Associated has already registered travelmail.co.uk, shopmail.co.uk, moneymail.co.uk and financialmail.co.uk. In fact the only one that is still available is showbizmail.co.uk - better snap it up quick. BR&gt; Yawning risers As the battle of the breakfast bulletins shapes up, it's nice to know GMTV isn't straying too far from its roots. Monkey understands that a well-known ballerina, whose agents approached the network offering an exclusive interview, was turned down on the grounds that \"ballet dancers are too upmarket for us. They turn off our viewers\". It came from the stalker Sophie Raworth, the pretty half of the BBC's new breakfast team, has caused quite a stir among blue-chip types. Eyebrows were raised at BBC news after she was found to have a website set up by a celebrity stalker. And it gets worse. Sophie's name mysteriously yields a link to a US adult site called Celeb Secrets: \"the web storehouse for nude celebrities\".

The young man - he is still only 25 - who is referred to simply as \"God\" by his team-mates, was attempting yet another comeback after two years of twisted limbs, torn muscles and tweaked tendons. </p> <p>Fowler started a senior game alongside Michael Owen for the first time in almost 12 months in a team with a distinctly makeshift look to it, G\u00e9rard Houllier opting for the sort of selection gamble which had proved to be Sir Alex Ferguson's undoing in Tuesday night's Champions League fixture against PSV Eindhoven. Out went such luminaries as Nick Barmby, St\u00e9phane Henchoz, Jamie Carragher and Christian Ziege to be replaced by the likes of Patrik Berger, who was returning to senior football for the first time since the opening day of the season. </p> <p>In the first leg, a scrappy game decided by a solitary Barmby goal, Rapid had looked so out of their depth it was anticipated they would collectively drown last night. That they did not, that they fought so gamely, seemed to surprise the junior members of the Liverpool team. Indeed, had Sami Hyypia not been so unyielding at the centre of the home defence, it is conceivable Rapid could have worked their way back to parity inside an opening 10 minutes which they illuminated with some rather classy foraging. </p> <p>It was Liverpool who were all at sea and in danger of drowning during this phase, and with Djimi Traore unable to contain the free-running Constantin Maldarasanu down the right flank, Rapid, quite unexpectedly, began to believe in miracles. </p> <p>Just as against Sunderland last weekend, Liverpool's football was never likely to be accused of boasting any fluency or authority; they toiled manfully in the hope of seeking out an opening to exploit but there was an annoying predictability to so much of their movement. </p> <p>Rapid fared much better and would have deservedly moved in front after 26 minutes had Daniel Pancu not steered his shot into the fast-advancing frame of Sander Westerveld after he had acrobatically hurdled Hyypia's tackle. </p> <p>Although Owen did miss a presentable chance on the stroke of half-time, it was not until Ziege was introduced in place of the hapless Traore that Liverpool began to hint at cohesion. There was still a palpable sense of desperation to much of their play, particularly in central midfield, but their attacks finally carried sufficient menace to cause at least some discomfort to the Rapid defence. </p> <p>Ziege went the closest to ending the torment, firing in low and hard from distance after 66 minutes only to be denied by Razvan Lucescu, who held on to the ball as a child does his favourite toy. </p> <p> <strong> Liverpool</strong> (4-4-2) Westerveld; Heggem, Hyppia, Babbel, Traore (Ziege, 50min); Gerrard, Hamann, Berger, Diomede (Barmby, 59); Owen, Fowler. </p> <p><strong> Rapid Bucharest</strong> (3-5-2) Lucescu; Stanciu, Iencsi, Frasineanu; Constantinovici, Maldarasanu, Isaila, Chirita, Iftodi (Bundea, 55); Schumacher (Radu, 65), Pancu (Constantin, 74). </p> <p><strong> Referee:</strong> M Liba (Czech Rep). </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

In the first leg, a scrappy game decided by a solitary Barmby goal, Rapid had looked so out of their depth it was anticipated they would collectively drown last night. That they did not, that they fought so gamely, seemed to surprise the junior members of the Liverpool team. Indeed, had Sami Hyypia not been so unyielding at the centre of the home defence, it is conceivable Rapid could have worked their way back to parity inside an opening 10 minutes which they illuminated with some rather classy foraging. It was Liverpool who were all at sea and in danger of drowning during this phase, and with Djimi Traore unable to contain the free-running Constantin Maldarasanu down the right flank, Rapid, quite unexpectedly, began to believe in miracles. Just as against Sunderland last weekend, Liverpool's football was never likely to be accused of boasting any fluency or authority; they toiled manfully in the hope of seeking out an opening to exploit but there was an annoying predictability to so much of their movement. Rapid fared much better and would have deservedly moved in front after 26 minutes had Daniel Pancu not steered his shot into the fast-advancing frame of Sander Westerveld after he had acrobatically hurdled Hyypia's tackle. Although Owen did miss a presentable chance on the stroke of half-time, it was not until Ziege was introduced in place of the hapless Traore that Liverpool began to hint at cohesion. There was still a palpable sense of desperation to much of their play, particularly in central midfield, but their attacks finally carried sufficient menace to cause at least some discomfort to the Rapid defence. Ziege went the closest to ending the torment, firing in low and hard from distance after 66 minutes only to be denied by Razvan Lucescu, who held on to the ball as a child does his favourite toy. Liverpool (4-4-2) Westerveld; Heggem, Hyppia, Babbel, Traore (Ziege, 50min); Gerrard, Hamann, Berger, Diomede (Barmby, 59); Owen, Fowler. Rapid Bucharest (3-5-2) Lucescu; Stanciu, Iencsi, Frasineanu; Constantinovici, Maldarasanu, Isaila, Chirita, Iftodi (Bundea, 55); Schumacher (Radu, 65), Pancu (Constantin, 74).

Equally, anyone present here will know that the US were desperately unlucky to fall to one of those scuffling, bloody-minded and shrewdly two-dimensional performances in which Norwegian football takes so much pride. </p> <p>But for all that, the US juggernaut has crashed through these Olympics with its usual blend of impressive power and unbearable bullishness, pausing occasionally to wonder just why its obsessive self-adulation has again been so often regarded as unbearable. </p> <p>Football has been saved by Norway's victory, if only linguistically. When the States overpower a sport, they do not seek to adopt its language, they impose their own. Football is not just accepted, it has to be filtered through their terminology and perceptions. It is endless self-justification. </p> <p>The English cliche has it that Mellgren's winning goal, a predictable long ball followed by a lucky rebound, had a suspicion of handball about it. The Americans carped about \"an offensive violation\", which sounded more like an accusation of sexual molestation than a foul. </p> <p>When the US conquer football, which one day they will, then the language of the beautiful game will change for ever. Brace yourself not for the pass inside but the inside lay, abandon the tackle for the hit, lost possession will become a turnover, attack will turn into offence. And prepare to be buried under meaningless statistics that inform you that humidity levels are 43%, the wind is light and variable from the north-west and the United States had 64% possession. Last night, they did. </p> <p>The opening US goal, after six minutes, was a joy. Mia Hamm displayed strength and agility in cutting through the left of the area (sorry, \"in a left-sided offensive\") and Milbrett, erm, rammed it home. Some of these football cliches aren't worth saving. Meanwhile in the media area the Americans were talking about how \"Mia had made the yardage\". </p> <p>Norway equalised before the interval. Undeservedly. In the last minute. From a corner. Margunn Haugenes swung over a cross from the right and Gro Espeseth beat Kate Sobrero to the header. They then survived persistent second-half pressure, with Hamm, Kristine Lilly and Milbrett threatening down the left, before going ahead with 12 minutes left. This goal was stamped Made In Norway: a long ball, a goalkeeper colliding with her own defender as she was drawn towards an interception she should never have considered and Ragnhild Gulbrandsen punishing the error. </p> <p>Milbrett's last-gasp equaliser (she is called Tiffeny, incidentally, after the spelling of a cat her mother saw for sale in her company newspaper) seemed sure to bring a US victory in extra-time. Mellgren, who was not named after a cat, largely because she is not American, ensured otherwise.</p>",

Equally, anyone present here will know that the US were desperately unlucky to fall to one of those scuffling, bloody-minded and shrewdly two-dimensional performances in which Norwegian football takes so much pride. But for all that, the US juggernaut has crashed through these Olympics with its usual blend of impressive power and unbearable bullishness, pausing occasionally to wonder just why its obsessive self-adulation has again been so often regarded as unbearable. Football has been saved by Norway's victory, if only linguistically. When the States overpower a sport, they do not seek to adopt its language, they impose their own. Football is not just accepted, it has to be filtered through their terminology and perceptions. It is endless self-justification. The English cliche has it that Mellgren's winning goal, a predictable long ball followed by a lucky rebound, had a suspicion of handball about it. The Americans carped about \"an offensive violation\", which sounded more like an accusation of sexual molestation than a foul. When the US conquer football, which one day they will, then the language of the beautiful game will change for ever. Brace yourself not for the pass inside but the inside lay, abandon the tackle for the hit, lost possession will become a turnover, attack will turn into offence. And prepare to be buried under meaningless statistics that inform you that humidity levels are 43%, the wind is light and variable from the north-west and the United States had 64% possession. Last night, they did. The opening US goal, after six minutes, was a joy. Mia Hamm displayed strength and agility in cutting through the left of the area (sorry, \"in a left-sided offensive\") and Milbrett, erm, rammed it home. Some of these football cliches aren't worth saving. Meanwhile in the media area the Americans were talking about how \"Mia had made the yardage\". Norway equalised before the interval. Undeservedly. In the last minute. From a corner. Margunn Haugenes swung over a cross from the right and Gro Espeseth beat Kate Sobrero to the header. They then survived persistent second-half pressure, with Hamm, Kristine Lilly and Milbrett threatening down the left, before going ahead with 12 minutes left. This goal was stamped Made In Norway: a long ball, a goalkeeper colliding with her own defender as she was drawn towards an interception she should never have considered and Ragnhild Gulbrandsen punishing the error. Milbrett's last-gasp equaliser (she is called Tiffeny, incidentally, after the spelling of a cat her mother saw for sale in her company newspaper) seemed sure to bring a US victory in extra-time. Mellgren, who was not named after a cat, largely because she is not American, ensured otherwise.",

But the hilarious footage of amateur chef Manju Malhi making coriander chutney as the wind blew the ingredients round the garden and drowned out her voice, has earned her a place on national television and a promise of future stardom. Ms Malhi has been snapped up by the celebrity agents who represent Jamie Oliver and Gary Rhodes, and is being billed as the next Madhur Jaffrey, after she was discovered on the BBC TV cookery programme Food and Drink in July last year. She has since stood in at short notice for Ms Jaffrey when she was forced to drop out of Gloria Hunniford's Channel 5 programme Open House, and has also been asked to run an Indian cookery course for the Anton Mossiman School. Fame beckoned when Ms Malhi entered a competition run by Food and Drink asking people to produce a home-made cookery show. She chose her secret recipe for chutney as a basis, and enlisted a friend and his \u00a3200 camcorder to act as cameraman. She decided to film the video at her home in north London after one quick rehearsal and a script cobbled together from tips gleaned from watching cookery shows. However, there was one small obstacle standing in the way of Ms Malhi's bid to become a celebrity chef. Her kitchen was in the middle of being renovated, with a battered electric hob acting as her cooker. \"I wasn't going to let the lack of a kitchen stand in my way,\" she said yesterday. \"I decided I would have to film my programme al fresco, and chose my back garden as the setting. I deliberately chose a coriander chutney because it didn't require a cooker, just a blender, and I made sure I remembered to hold the ingredients up to the camera, just liked I'd seen on the telly. \"My partner, Arun, spotted me and my friend in the garden with a camcorder and thought we were just messing about, pretending to make a film like Blair Witch.\" She was amazed when she received a phone call from the BBC, telling her she had beaten hundreds of other contestants. On Wednesday night, millions of viewers who were not watching the Arsenal v Lazio game tuned in to Food and Drink and saw an update on Ms Malhi's progress - with chef Anthony Worral Thompson jokingly bundling her off the set, saying that he felt his job was in jeopardy because her cooking was so tasty. Raised in Middlesex, Manju learned about traditional Indian cooking by spending two years studying in Bombay and by learning from her mother, Kami. \"I grew up surrounded by Indian culture, traditions and lifestyles. In my cooking I try to draw on my own past and try to combine it with the realities of urban western life.

I am amazed my home video helped me so much, because it looks so amateurish. But the chutney has always been a winner with my friends.\" Ms Malhi has just finished filming a cookery series for Carlton Food Network, to be screened later this year, and has teamed up with a food company to develop a range of Indian meals.

It said the captain had been asleep and had delegated duties. The paper also claimed that he had collided with another ship in Piraeus harbour. The daily Kathimerini was scathing about Tuesday's disaster: \"The captain was watching the Panathaikos match, even the officers, the crew was incapable of handling the crisis and the boat, one of the most pathetic in the Greek fleet, was carried onto rocks that were nevertheless clearly lit up.\" Mr Nagos dismissed one media report that the captain had deliberately sank the Express Samina to make an insurance claim: \"We are not premeditated killers, for God's sake.\" Prosecutors are believed to be turning their attention to the second in command, Mr Psychoyios, who is reported to have been on the bridge. The investigation is also focusing on claims that the ship was on automatic pilot minutes before striking the outcrop. The death toll rose to 65 early yesterday after two bodies were recovered overnight. A total of 448 people have been rescued but some are still missing. Between 525 and 530 people were believed to have been on board. No Britons were among the dead. Strong winds yesterday prevented divers from searching the wrecked hull, which is believed to contain up to 14 corpses. It is lying on the seabed at a depth of 38 metres. Two helicopters, four Greek navy boats, two coastguard rescue vessels and a British warship were sweeping the waters for survivors off Paros, a popular tourist destination in the Cyclades islands south-east of Athens. Survivors yesterday relived the terror of the moment the 35-year-old ferry listed and then sank within half an hour. Passengers, some without lifejackets, were thrown into rough, dark seas.",

A soccer-mad British collector was described as \"overjoyed\" with his acquisition which he bid for by telephone from his hotel room in Sydney where he is holidaying during the Olympic games. Christie's spokeswoman Jill Potterton said the die-hard Tottenham Hotspur fan who attended the 1966 final as a 12- year-old had stayed up until all hours to join in the bidding from all around the world.

The successful bidder later told Christie's staff that he hoped the shirt would ultimately go on show at the foot ball museum in Preston once it is opened. West Ham, the club Sir Geoff played for at the time of the World Cup final in which he scored a hat-trick, was believed to be among the unsuccessful British bidders for the shirt. Another of the 129 lots put up by Sir Geoff, the blue cap awarded to him for the final stages of the World Cup triumph, fetched \u00a337,600.

But Graham Powell was voted out of his role as chairman of the board of governors during the three and a quarter hour meeting at St Mary's junior school in Caldicot, south Wales. Members of the board are believed to be divided over their support for the headteacher, who has been questioned by police over further allegations that she mistreated pupils at the school. Mr Powell's replacement, Robert Gibbs, the former vice-chairman, refused to comment on whether Mrs Evans would be reinstated. In a statement, he said: \"After long and careful consideration the necessary decision was made concerning staffing matters. \"The governors are not in the position to reveal the content of their deliberations until staff at the school know themselves.\" After the meeting, which Mrs Evans did not attend, Mr Powell said the decision about his own post was a \"democratic\" one and that he was not disappointed by the vote. Mrs Evans was first suspended a year ago from St Mary's after being charged with assaulting a pupil who was trying to headbutt, punch and push her. The 56-year-old from Usk, south Wales, was convicted of common assault at Abergavenny magistrates court in July. But a high court judge sitting at Cardiff crown court overturned the decision earlier this month. After the successful appeal, Mrs Evans said she wanted to get back to the school as soon as possible. But her hopes were dashed after it was revealed that police were investigating fresh allegations of pupil mistreatment. Her suspension remained in force and the school's governors said they would reconsider the issue at the end of the month. Mrs Evans and three other members of staff were questioned by police earlier this week concerning the new allegations. A report has been submitted to the crown prosecution service.",

Baron Thyssen, who transferred the group to his son in 1983, began a lawsuit in Bermuda last year in which he claimed he was owed tens of millions of dollars by Heini Jnr as part of the handover deal. He bemoaned the greed of his boy, writing: \"I want you to know that it remains my intention that each of my children should obtain his or her proper share of my assets upon my death. At present, Heini Jnr has manoeuvred himself into a position where, in the absence of action on my part, he would get far too much, and I wish to correct this.\" With the art collection at stake, as well as nine houses across the world, not to mention the group itself, there is much to play for.",

After a brief pause to finish off his smoked salmon puff with chervil and cottage cheese in a pastry wrap, Harold slammed his fist down on the nearest table, a courageous move if somewhat impulsive, as a large dish of profiteroles had been placed there only minutes before. </p> <p>It might have been a disaster, but luckily most of the profiteroles stayed in the rough vicinity of the table, and the vast majority of the remaining 10-20% flew through the air before being fortuitously caught in the nooks and crannies of guests' apparel.

Harold simply glowered back. The family friend smiled diplomatically and pressed on. \"I'd have to agree with you that he should have listened more to the admirable Kissinger, if that's what you mean,\" he said - and bang went the meringues too. </p> <p> But we were all of us agreed that he is undoubtedly our greatest living playwright. \"He's undoubtedly our greatest living playwright,\" I said to Joan Bakewell as we queued for the wine cup together. \"Oh, yes,\" she replied, \"I'd have to agree that he's undoubtedly our greatest living playwright.\" Joan then turned to Melvyn Bragg, and asked him where he stood on the issue. \"In my opinion,\" said Melvyn, \"he's our greatest living playwright.

      "body": "<p>The young Joyce Cary went off in 1912 to join the Balkan armies fighting to expel the Turks because he wanted to experience a war and thought that this might be the last fight for many years. Coming up with the Montenegrins to take the surrender of the Turks at Scutari six months later, he wrote of passing through \"the broken wire of the February battle, many small graves, many little shelters full of spent cases. There was a sweet sickly smell of dead unburied bodies.\" The men were ordered to take cover as the final negotiations took place. \"As the order was passed back from flagman to flagman,\" Cary wrote in a tone of finality, \"the companies sank down in succession, the padding and rustling of moccasins ceased, and there was a sudden dead silence.\"</p> <p>Cary, like many others, thought that would be the end of the killing. But establishing nation states in the rivalrous and demographically mixed region over which Turkey had ruled proved a lengthy and bloody business.

      "bodyText": "The young Joyce Cary went off in 1912 to join the Balkan armies fighting to expel the Turks because he wanted to experience a war and thought that this might be the last fight for many years. Coming up with the Montenegrins to take the surrender of the Turks at Scutari six months later, he wrote of passing through \"the broken wire of the February battle, many small graves, many little shelters full of spent cases. There was a sweet sickly smell of dead unburied bodies.\" The men were ordered to take cover as the final negotiations took place. \"As the order was passed back from flagman to flagman,\" Cary wrote in a tone of finality, \"the companies sank down in succession, the padding and rustling of moccasins ceased, and there was a sudden dead silence.\" Cary, like many others, thought that would be the end of the killing. But establishing nation states in the rivalrous and demographically mixed region over which Turkey had ruled proved a lengthy and bloody business. The Balkan wars did not end with Turkey's defeat, for the peoples of the peninsula were soon fighting each other. Their conflicts then contributed to, and were caught up in, the two world wars. They subsided afterwards as Moscow's order took hold, only to fire up again, in the case of Yugoslavia, after the disintegration of the communist world. But this week it is at last possible to say that the Balkan wars are over.

The Oxford Dictionary of Thematic Quotations offers more than 600 easy-to-browse contemporary themes, ranging from acting to weather. \"This is a book to which people will turn in order to listen to contemporary discussion on a wide range of topics,\" said Elizabeth Knowles, managing editor of OUP's quotations dictionaries. \"The thematic divisions focus on issues of today. We have still included remarks from some classic authors, but the topics chosen are those that reflect modern concerns.\" She said contrasting comments under each heading would provide readers with food for thought. The entry for politics, for example, gives Harold Wilson's words on the 1964 sterling crisis: \"A week is a long time in politics.\" But the then backbencher Ken Livingstone said in 1997: \"Politics is a marathon, not a sprint.\" Both observations, it seems, have weathered well. Under the heading quotations, a remark from Winston Churchill reads: \"It is a good thing for an uneducated man to read books of quotations.\" Yet on the same page the American essayist Ralph Emerson suggests that parroting other people's words limits true thought: \"I hate quotation. Tell me what you know.\" Ms Knowles said the dictionary incorporated comments from more than 1,000 wits, including contemporary figures such as Joan Collins, Jeremy Paxman and the rap artist Ice Cube. Noel Gallagher's profane boast as to the crowd pulling power of his band, Oasis - \"has God played Knebworth?\" - makes it into the dictionary, though it may not prove as resonant as Friedrich Nietzsche's 1882 assault on the almighty: \"God is dead: but ... there will perhaps be caves, for ages yet, in which his shadow will be shown.\" Ms Knowles identified a recent drift towards the shorter, sometimes more glib soundbite, but cautioned against accusing modern commentators of failing to match up. \"I don't believe the standard has fallen,\" she said. \"What gets overlooked is that the past is represented by the few quotations that have lasted and the many remarks we remember from the last couple of years will not all stand the test of time.\" The dictionary includes entries from the few politicians fighting the trend towards verbless soundbites. Modern topics under discussion include personal computers, which, according to Timothy Leary in 1996, were \"the LSD of the 90s\", heralding an era in which the US historian Francis Fukuyama last year claimed: \"Silicon Valley is the Florence of the late 20th century.\" Other contemporary commentators are recorded battling over the role of science in society. \"We ought not to permit a cottage industry in the God business,\" the US Republican John Marchi said three years ago on hearing that British scientists had cloned a sheep.

If we can do that, we'd be on a totally different level.\"</p> <p>The deeply discounted rights issue, underwritten by Credit Suisse First Boston, initially left BTG's shares lower in early trading. But by the market's close yesterday they had risen 55p, or 3.4%, to \u00a316.60. Dr Erling Refsum, biotech analyst with Nomura, said the reaction was \"very positive\". \"People like BTG and the shares have been so tightly held it has been difficult to get hold of them,\" he said.</p> <p>\"They have bought the story that this is going to make BTG grow faster.\"</p> <p>Until now the company has concentrated on identifying early stage technologies being developed by universities and research centres.</p> <p>Varisolve, which it bought from a surgeon in 1996, has been one of its biggest successes. BTG has since spun this off into a separate company, Provensis.The company's portfolio at present covers more than 300 technologies, protected by over 5,000 granted patents and patent applications.</p> <p>Earlier this year, BTG reported its first profit in six years on the back of a sharp rise in revenues from licensing and patent sales.</p> <p>BTG, which was floated in 1995, reported a pre-tax profit of \u00a3920,000 for the year to March 31, compared with a loss of \u00a36m previously.</p> <p>The result was bolstered by a one-off gain of \u00a32.5m from the sale of investments.

      "bodyText": "BTG, which commercialises patents, announced yesterday that it was raising \u00a3120m to expand the business and create a new company dedicated to genomics. A one for nine rights issue, at \u00a312 a share, will enable it to exploit new developments around the world. The company will channel \u00a335m into further varicose vein treatments, \u00a35m into genomics-based technologies and \u00a321m into developing and buying new biotechnologies - including \u00a39.5m for new cancer treatments. Rusi Kathoke, BTG's finance director, said they had been anticipating the move for 18 months and had \"very detailed plans\" for investments. \"The money we have raised is for us to do more of the same and get greater value,\" he said. \"Our aim is to be able to feed potential technologies into our portfolio that will generate the sort of patent volumes Varisolve [its existing varicose vein treatment] has achieved. If we can do that, we'd be on a totally different level.\" The deeply discounted rights issue, underwritten by Credit Suisse First Boston, initially left BTG's shares lower in early trading. But by the market's close yesterday they had risen 55p, or 3.4%, to \u00a316.60. Dr Erling Refsum, biotech analyst with Nomura, said the reaction was \"very positive\". \"People like BTG and the shares have been so tightly held it has been difficult to get hold of them,\" he said. \"They have bought the story that this is going to make BTG grow faster.\" Until now the company has concentrated on identifying early stage technologies being developed by universities and research centres. Varisolve, which it bought from a surgeon in 1996, has been one of its biggest successes. BTG has since spun this off into a separate company, Provensis.The company's portfolio at present covers more than 300 technologies, protected by over 5,000 granted patents and patent applications. Earlier this year, BTG reported its first profit in six years on the back of a sharp rise in revenues from licensing and patent sales. BTG, which was floated in 1995, reported a pre-tax profit of \u00a3920,000 for the year to March 31, compared with a loss of \u00a36m previously. The result was bolstered by a one-off gain of \u00a32.5m from the sale of investments. However, revenue soared by 63%, to \u00a336.4m.",

It revolutionised Israeli poetry. Shunning the formalism of pre-state poets, Amichai introduced slang and prosaic modern terms to liberate Hebrew, \"this weary language torn from its sleep in the Bible\". His words elide seamlessly from biblical phraseology to 20th-century banality: \"The man under his fig tree telephoned the man under his vine.\"</p> <p>From early on, Amichai rejected his parents' orthodoxy. Yet the metre of holy texts still rang in his ears and echoed in his writing. Sometimes, he railed against a \"toothless\" or \"merciless\" God, who had deserted mankind. Mostly, though, his poems are affectionately irreverent. One likens the weekly Torah recital to reading God bedtime stories, much as Scheherezade did in 1001 Nights. Another has the Prophet Jacob climb his ladder to become a window-cleaner to celestial VIPs.</p> <p>Amichai also respected medieval and early 20th-century Hebrew writers, like Leah Goldberg. He took her poems into battle with him in 1948 - just as soldiers later car ried his verse in their kits during the war of 1973 with Egypt.</p> <p>During the days of the British mandate in Palestine, Amichai ferried Jewish refugees into Palestine, ran guns for the embryonic Israeli army, and later served in three wars. However, he was always a critical zionist. He opposed triumphalism and campaigned against Israel's Lebanese war. One poem undermines the David v Goliath motif. While David's comrades whoop with joy at his victory, the hero feels shame at carrying Goliath's gory severed head.

He could write for a popular audience with compassion and wit, as he proved in a Sun story about the conditions of women night cleaners, when he described a night spent as a rather inept lavatory cleaner.</p> <p>Concerned about women's rights issues, he became a regular contributor to the Guardian women's page. And it was Geoffrey who, in 1977, broke the story about the then British Leyland boss, Sir Richard Dobson, taped making racist remarks during an after-dinner speech.</p> <p>Geoffrey was a founder member of the Campaign for Press and Broadcasting Freedom (CPBF) and the Campaign Against Racism in the Media (CARM). He was an activist in the National Union of Journalists, and, from the late 1960s until its dissolution, a member of the Trotskyist International Marxist Group (IMG).</p> <p>The son of a tailor, and Communist party member, Geoffrey grew up in Stamford Hill, north London. From 1955 to 1962, he attended Hackney Downs school, where he proved himself an exceptionally bright student. He showed an early interest in journalism, although his enthusiasm was initially driven more by enterprise than idealism. He scanned the locals, and early editions of the London evening papers, for stories he could sell to their rivals. Throughout his life, he united his journalistic nous with business flair.</p> <p>Geoffrey was part of that postwar, post-austerity generation of state-educated, working-class children who burrowed their way into higher education; in his case to Oxford University. From 1962 to 1965, he read politics, philosophy and economics at Balliol College, and launched into journalism via the university student newspaper. In the post-Hungary, post-Suez climate of the times, the British new left - which rejected orthodox communism - was forming, and Geoffrey allied himself with a group of non-aligned leftwingers, whose radical socialist philosophy influenced the rest of his life.</p> <p>After graduation, he freelanced and became active in the London left. At the end of the decade, he joined the IMG. By 1977, he was working fulltime for the group's weekly paper, Socialist Challenge. In the early 1980s, after the CPBF was formed, he edited its journal, Free Press. Soon afterwards, he helped to form CARM, and wrote its pamphlet, It Ain't Half Racist, Mum.</p> <p>By then, Geoffrey was in the Labour party. In 1981, he joined the editorial board of the party's monthly, New Socialist, as business manager. The magazine - if not the party - was then flourishing as a forum for debate, and his business skill kept it on a sound economic footing.</p> <p>From 1987 until his death, he worked in business planning for Hackney council. He acquired a master's degree in business administration and was based in the central strategy and regeneration unit.</p> <p>Increasingly, his later writing reflected his curiosity about people and their stories. He faced his early death with great courage, fascinated by the hospital system and the people around him. Patients, he proposed, should record their own ideas and concerns for their hospital clinical notes.</p> <p>He leaves a son, Sam Masters, and his partner, the GP Dr Jackie Maxmin.</p> <p>\u0095 Geoffrey Michael Sheridan, journalist, born September 25 1944; died September 23 2000</p>",

Concerned about women's rights issues, he became a regular contributor to the Guardian women's page. And it was Geoffrey who, in 1977, broke the story about the then British Leyland boss, Sir Richard Dobson, taped making racist remarks during an after-dinner speech. Geoffrey was a founder member of the Campaign for Press and Broadcasting Freedom (CPBF) and the Campaign Against Racism in the Media (CARM). He was an activist in the National Union of Journalists, and, from the late 1960s until its dissolution, a member of the Trotskyist International Marxist Group (IMG). The son of a tailor, and Communist party member, Geoffrey grew up in Stamford Hill, north London. From 1955 to 1962, he attended Hackney Downs school, where he proved himself an exceptionally bright student. He showed an early interest in journalism, although his enthusiasm was initially driven more by enterprise than idealism. He scanned the locals, and early editions of the London evening papers, for stories he could sell to their rivals. Throughout his life, he united his journalistic nous with business flair. Geoffrey was part of that postwar, post-austerity generation of state-educated, working-class children who burrowed their way into higher education; in his case to Oxford University. From 1962 to 1965, he read politics, philosophy and economics at Balliol College, and launched into journalism via the university student newspaper. In the post-Hungary, post-Suez climate of the times, the British new left - which rejected orthodox communism - was forming, and Geoffrey allied himself with a group of non-aligned leftwingers, whose radical socialist philosophy influenced the rest of his life. After graduation, he freelanced and became active in the London left. At the end of the decade, he joined the IMG. By 1977, he was working fulltime for the group's weekly paper, Socialist Challenge. In the early 1980s, after the CPBF was formed, he edited its journal, Free Press. Soon afterwards, he helped to form CARM, and wrote its pamphlet, It Ain't Half Racist, Mum. By then, Geoffrey was in the Labour party. In 1981, he joined the editorial board of the party's monthly, New Socialist, as business manager. The magazine - if not the party - was then flourishing as a forum for debate, and his business skill kept it on a sound economic footing. From 1987 until his death, he worked in business planning for Hackney council. He acquired a master's degree in business administration and was based in the central strategy and regeneration unit. Increasingly, his later writing reflected his curiosity about people and their stories. He faced his early death with great courage, fascinated by the hospital system and the people around him. Patients, he proposed, should record their own ideas and concerns for their hospital clinical notes. He leaves a son, Sam Masters, and his partner, the GP Dr Jackie Maxmin. \u0095 Geoffrey Michael Sheridan, journalist, born September 25 1944; died September 23 2000",

Freeserve itself was still subsidising unmetered access. </p> <p>He said it was enhancing the portal side of the Freeserve business, only matched in Britain by Yahoo!, by encour aging users to stay online longer than they had in the past. </p> <p>Unmetered access was also generating higher e-commerce and advertising revenue. \"We are able to charge \u00a370 per thousand pages for personalised pages on the women's portal say, compared to figures in the teens for the home page,\" said Mr Backhouse. </p> <p>Freeserve was forced to admit that there was congestion on its unmetered access service due to heavy demand, but said that this would be eradicated by a forthcoming 25% increase in network capacity. </p> <p>The company has been criticised by analysts who believe it should concentrate more on content to compete harder with Yahoo! and others rather than worrying about access. </p> <p>Mr Backhouse said the two aspects of the business served each other. The 186m page impressions Freeserve was obtaining on its portal, two-and-a-half times more than last year, suggested users were happy with the content which was constantly being upgraded. </p> <p>The company launched a new internet television portal which will be featured on a range of new Bush internet television sets and is also producing its own broadband internet operation. </p> <p>In the first quarter Freeserve introduced its own brand of Wap (wireless application protocol) phone which is already the fastest selling such phone in Dixons stores. </p> <p>Some analysts believe that the share price will remain depressed unless another bidder comes along. </p> <p>France's Wanadoo internet service is apparently one European rival which could be interested in breaking into the British market.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Losses at Freeserve, Britain's biggest internet service provider, doubled to \u00a317.81m in the first quarter sending its already battered shares spinning down further. But company executives dismissed the extra losses as partly the result of one-off marketing spend, and said they were still on target to meet their growth goals. Turnover at Freeserve rose fourfold to hit \u00a314.6m over the 16 weeks to August 19 compared with a 12 week period the year before. Freeserve, 80% owned by Dixons, Europe's biggest electrical retailer, said growing sales demonstrated the strength of the business as an independent company. The company saw its shares rise to 900p in the summer after it revealed it was in talks with Germany's T-Online about a possible merger. Since discussions broke down the shares have tumbled and last night they ended down a further 7p at 235p as the company confirmed no further talks of any kind were under way. Freeserve said it had been bringing in just under 10,000 new internet accounts ever week since the first quarter end and now had 250,000 unmetered customers. Neil Backhouse, the finance director, said that the failure of rivals to offer unmetered access - as much internet time as users want for a flat fee including call charges - had given Freeserve a huge advantage and driven up its total user base to over 2m accounts. Freeserve itself was still subsidising unmetered access. He said it was enhancing the portal side of the Freeserve business, only matched in Britain by Yahoo!, by encour aging users to stay online longer than they had in the past. Unmetered access was also generating higher e-commerce and advertising revenue. \"We are able to charge \u00a370 per thousand pages for personalised pages on the women's portal say, compared to figures in the teens for the home page,\" said Mr Backhouse. Freeserve was forced to admit that there was congestion on its unmetered access service due to heavy demand, but said that this would be eradicated by a forthcoming 25% increase in network capacity. The company has been criticised by analysts who believe it should concentrate more on content to compete harder with Yahoo! and others rather than worrying about access. Mr Backhouse said the two aspects of the business served each other. The 186m page impressions Freeserve was obtaining on its portal, two-and-a-half times more than last year, suggested users were happy with the content which was constantly being upgraded. The company launched a new internet television portal which will be featured on a range of new Bush internet television sets and is also producing its own broadband internet operation. In the first quarter Freeserve introduced its own brand of Wap (wireless application protocol) phone which is already the fastest selling such phone in Dixons stores. Some analysts believe that the share price will remain depressed unless another bidder comes along. France's Wanadoo internet service is apparently one European rival which could be interested in breaking into the British market.",

      "body": "<p><a href=\"http://www.eidos.com/\" target=\"_NEW\">Eidos</a>, the computer games maker behind the Tomb Raider series, suffered another blow yesterday when Sony admitted to a shortfall of its long-awaited PlayStation 2. </p> <p>The announcement caused shares in Eidos to fall more than 6% to 348.5p, continuing a wretched 12 months for the company. The stock has fallen from a peak of \u00a312.73 after two profit warnings earlier this year caused by delays in getting its own product to market. </p> <p>Sony said it would ship only half as many PlayStation 2 consoles to the US for its October launch as it had initially planned. In the first weekend 500,000 of the consoles will be available. The British launch is expected in November. </p> <p>The arrival of PlayStation 2 has been much anticipated by games manufacturers who have complained of a drop off in sales while players wait for the new model to arrive in the shops. Eidos sales in the US were 19% lower last year. </p> <p>A spokesman for Eidos said PlayStation 2 was expected to make its biggest impact over Christmas 2001 and played down the effect of the shortfall. Sony plans to stagger additional shipments of the games console of 100,000 units a week and said it still hoped to meet its targets of 1.3m units in the US by Christmas and 3m by the end of March. </p> <p>The Japanese electronics firm said it was one month behind schedule because of component shortages. </p> <p>Software development has also been slower than Sony had anticipated. There will be 26 games available at launch instead of the 50 promised - though games for the first version of the console will be compatible with the new model. Shares in Sony were also hit yesterday and slumped by 9% in early trading on Wall Street. </p> <p>The collapse of the Eidos share price earlier this year lead to a takeover approach, understood to be from French rival Infogrames. </p> <p>Eidos said in June that talks had opened with a potential buyer of the business and issued a separate statement last month which said discussions were still ongoing. </p> <p>Eidos is preparing for the launch of the fifth instalment in its Tomb Raider series featuring the iconic character Lara Croft.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Eidos, the computer games maker behind the Tomb Raider series, suffered another blow yesterday when Sony admitted to a shortfall of its long-awaited PlayStation 2. The announcement caused shares in Eidos to fall more than 6% to 348.5p, continuing a wretched 12 months for the company. The stock has fallen from a peak of \u00a312.73 after two profit warnings earlier this year caused by delays in getting its own product to market. Sony said it would ship only half as many PlayStation 2 consoles to the US for its October launch as it had initially planned. In the first weekend 500,000 of the consoles will be available. The British launch is expected in November. The arrival of PlayStation 2 has been much anticipated by games manufacturers who have complained of a drop off in sales while players wait for the new model to arrive in the shops. Eidos sales in the US were 19% lower last year. A spokesman for Eidos said PlayStation 2 was expected to make its biggest impact over Christmas 2001 and played down the effect of the shortfall. Sony plans to stagger additional shipments of the games console of 100,000 units a week and said it still hoped to meet its targets of 1.3m units in the US by Christmas and 3m by the end of March. The Japanese electronics firm said it was one month behind schedule because of component shortages. Software development has also been slower than Sony had anticipated. There will be 26 games available at launch instead of the 50 promised - though games for the first version of the console will be compatible with the new model. Shares in Sony were also hit yesterday and slumped by 9% in early trading on Wall Street. The collapse of the Eidos share price earlier this year lead to a takeover approach, understood to be from French rival Infogrames. Eidos said in June that talks had opened with a potential buyer of the business and issued a separate statement last month which said discussions were still ongoing. Eidos is preparing for the launch of the fifth instalment in its Tomb Raider series featuring the iconic character Lara Croft.",

Since the Heraklion sank with the loss of 217 lives in 1966, there has been a stream of similar ferry casualties, such as the Eleana, when 25 died, or the Chryssi Avgi, which sank with 18 fatalities. Only last year 14 Kurdish refugees perished in a fire on board the Superfast III ferry, leaving many to conclude that safety in Greece is not taken as seriously as in other countries, especially during the hectic summer season. There are no flamboyant figures such as Aristotle Onassis or Stavros Niarchos anymore, but the modern executives still wield enormous political power in a country where shipping challenges tourism as the top foreign money spinner. That feeling was strengthened when the government fought a successful campaign to exempt local shipowners from tighter international safety regulations after the sinking of the MS Estonia in the Baltic Sea in 1994. This allowed vessels that were more than 27 years old - such as the 34-year-old Express Samina - to operate without upgraded safety standards until their enforced retirement at the age 35. Greek shipowner representatives in the UK insisted last night that only competitors would argue that the reputation of the Hellenic fleet was poor. They said that the Greek regulations, which all ferries must comply with, were among the safest.

      "bodyText": "The government is to postpone the date of the Queen's speech to the end of November to give controversial measures such as the freedom of information and the right to roam bills a chance to reach the statute book. The failure to agree a date for the state opening of parliament is believed to have caused some anxiety at Buckingham Palace as the Queen has not been able to finalise her diary of engagements until it is settled. It is believed that a meeting of the government's business managers, in the House of Lords yesterday, agreed to put back the state opening of parliament rather than be forced to ditch any one of the promised bills because of a shortage of parliamentary time. The Queen's speech will contain the last batch of bills that Labour will put forward before the general election, which is expected next May. The decision to postpone the Queen's speech by at least two weeks will be greeted with huge relief, particularly by freedom of information campaigners who had feared that ministers' commitment to the bill would weaken in the face of problems in the House of Lords during the current overspill session. Ministers yesterday published the list of clauses and schedules for the committee stage of the freedom of information bill, which is expected to start in the middle of October. \"The government has been doing serious work on this bill. It is quite clear it is still strongly backed. It has not been dropped,\" said a House of Lords source. MPs are not due to return to Westminster until October 23 when they will elect a new speaker, but peers went back on Wednesday to start work on the outstanding number of bills that Labour hopes to get onto the statute book in this 'overspill session' before the next Queen's speech. Peers are already planning an all night sitting to deal with the countryside bill, which protects sites of scientific interest as well as introducing the right to roam. The Home Office confirmed yesterday that peers will have to work their way through swaths of amendments to the freedom of information bill before it has a chance to reach the statute book. The overspill session in the Lords will also see battles over the transport bill, which introduces congestion charges and privatises the national air traffic control system.",

      "body": "<p>News reports from the meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank in Prague this week have been dominated by the violence of a few thousand protesters. Images of cobbles being thrown, policemen being set on fire and ranks of riot police made dramatic copy and television. </p> <p>Now it is all over, and the smell of tear gas is fading in Wenceslas Square, there is real bitterness on all sides. Protesters complain that the \"mainstream\" media allied themselves with the repressive Czech authorities to deliberately misrepresent their presence in Prague. World Bank and IMF officials are tired of their meetings being turned into sieges. Particularly in the bank, reformers, including James Wolfensohn, feel that their efforts to persuade governments to be more generous with aid and debt relief, go unacknowledged. </p> <p>Both sides have to confront tough questions. The protest movement cannot duck the issue of the minority of violent anarchists who now exploit it to vent their own appetite for violence. The anti-globalisation movement is in danger of being discredited because of the antics of a small group. Inpeg, the Czech environmentalist umbrella group which organised the protests, refused to condemn Molotov cocktails being thrown at police: one man burnt was nothing compared to the damage done by the IMF and the World Bank, said one Inpeg spokesman. This is absurd reasoning. The violence is also counterproductive because it discredits the protest movement's claim to be peaceful and constructive.

      "bodyText": "News reports from the meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank in Prague this week have been dominated by the violence of a few thousand protesters. Images of cobbles being thrown, policemen being set on fire and ranks of riot police made dramatic copy and television. Now it is all over, and the smell of tear gas is fading in Wenceslas Square, there is real bitterness on all sides. Protesters complain that the \"mainstream\" media allied themselves with the repressive Czech authorities to deliberately misrepresent their presence in Prague. World Bank and IMF officials are tired of their meetings being turned into sieges. Particularly in the bank, reformers, including James Wolfensohn, feel that their efforts to persuade governments to be more generous with aid and debt relief, go unacknowledged. Both sides have to confront tough questions. The protest movement cannot duck the issue of the minority of violent anarchists who now exploit it to vent their own appetite for violence. The anti-globalisation movement is in danger of being discredited because of the antics of a small group. Inpeg, the Czech environmentalist umbrella group which organised the protests, refused to condemn Molotov cocktails being thrown at police: one man burnt was nothing compared to the damage done by the IMF and the World Bank, said one Inpeg spokesman. This is absurd reasoning. The violence is also counterproductive because it discredits the protest movement's claim to be peaceful and constructive. Both these claims are now in question. This is a serious loss; the protest movement has played a role in shifting the thinking of the international institutions - it has raised the profile of debt relief and poverty reduction - while embarking on a mass education campaign. The seminars in the streets in Prague on details of the global financial architecture such as structural adjustment programmes and capital liberalisation, are a healthy contribution to global democracy. Less healthy is the increasingly vocal element calling for abolition of the IMF and the World Bank. This position is the same as that of the right wing of the US Republican party.

Surrounded by hundreds of Israeli riot police, Mr Sharon and a handful of Likud politicians marched up to the Haram al-Sharif, the site of the gold Dome of the Rock that is the third holiest shrine in Islam. He came down 45 minutes later, leaving a trail of fury. Young Palestinians heaved chairs, stones, rubbish bins, and whatever missiles came to hand at the Israeli forces.

The symbolism of the visit to the Haram by Mr Sharon - reviled for his role in the 1982 massacre of Palestinians in a refugee camp in Lebanon - and its timing was unmistakable. \"This is a dangerous process conducted by Sharon against Islamic sacred places,\" Yasser Arafat told Palestinian television. Mr Sharon's second motive was less obvious: to steal the limelight from the former prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, who returned from the US yesterday and could become a challenger for the Likud party leadership after Israel's attorney general decided not to prosecute him for corruption. But that ambition was overshadowed by the potential for serious violence at Haram al-Sharif, the point where history, religion and national aspiration converge.

      "body": "<p>A retired colonel charged under the Official Secrets Act is in a dispute with the Ministry of Defence over its refusal to disclose documents he wants to fight his case.</p> <p>Nigel Wylde, a former bomb disposal officer in Northern Ireland, will today ask a high court judge to force the min istry to hand over papers in preparation for his trial at the Old Bailey on November 20. He is charged with handing classified documents to a journalist, Tony Geraghty.</p> <p>State prosecutors are faced with the embarrassing prospect of ministers having to sign public interest immunity certificates, so-called gagging orders, if disclosure were ordered. Alternatively, the attorney general, Lord Williams, does have the power to stop prosecutions under the secrets act, and he has asked for transcripts of the pre-trial hearings, the Guardian has learned.</p> <p>Lord Williams has already dropped charges against Mr Geraghty, whose book, The Irish War, gives details of army computer surveillance in Nor thern Ireland. A paperback version of the book, first published in 1998, came out this month despite MoD opposition.</p> <p>Col Wylde, holder of the Queen's Gallantry Medal for defusing unexploded bombs, strongly denies damaging national security. He will argue that the secrets act is incompatible with the Human Rights Act that comes into force on Monday. The secrets act does not allow a public interest defence and reverses the burden of proof.</p> <p>Lord Williams, a proponent of the rights act, is faced with the risk of seeing the first successful challenge to the secrets act or advising the prosecution to drop the case.</p> <p>The judge presiding over the pre-trial hearings is Alan Moses. As prosecuting counsel in the Matrix Churchill arms-to-Iraq case in 1992, he has first-hand experience of ministers trying to suppress evidence by the use of PII certificates.</p> <p>The Matrix Churchill trial collapsed principally because evidence that the trial judge ordered to be disclosed revealed a Whitehall cover-up. Mr Justice Moses has already referred in an open court hearing to previous secrets trials where the defendants were acquitted. He has also described Col Wylde, who remains a reserve officer, as a special case.</p> <p>The Irish War describes the growing use of computers by military intelligence in identifying targets, including automatic photographing of vehicle registration plates.</p> <p>\"In Northern Ireland ... at least 1m names are now on some security agency's computer,\" Mr Geraghty wrote. Two other computer systems \"provide total cover of a largely innocent population\". He quoted an army document stating: \"The use of ever-increasing emerging technologies requires us to disguise the true nature of the devices.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "A retired colonel charged under the Official Secrets Act is in a dispute with the Ministry of Defence over its refusal to disclose documents he wants to fight his case. Nigel Wylde, a former bomb disposal officer in Northern Ireland, will today ask a high court judge to force the min istry to hand over papers in preparation for his trial at the Old Bailey on November 20. He is charged with handing classified documents to a journalist, Tony Geraghty. State prosecutors are faced with the embarrassing prospect of ministers having to sign public interest immunity certificates, so-called gagging orders, if disclosure were ordered. Alternatively, the attorney general, Lord Williams, does have the power to stop prosecutions under the secrets act, and he has asked for transcripts of the pre-trial hearings, the Guardian has learned. Lord Williams has already dropped charges against Mr Geraghty, whose book, The Irish War, gives details of army computer surveillance in Nor thern Ireland. A paperback version of the book, first published in 1998, came out this month despite MoD opposition. Col Wylde, holder of the Queen's Gallantry Medal for defusing unexploded bombs, strongly denies damaging national security. He will argue that the secrets act is incompatible with the Human Rights Act that comes into force on Monday. The secrets act does not allow a public interest defence and reverses the burden of proof. Lord Williams, a proponent of the rights act, is faced with the risk of seeing the first successful challenge to the secrets act or advising the prosecution to drop the case. The judge presiding over the pre-trial hearings is Alan Moses. As prosecuting counsel in the Matrix Churchill arms-to-Iraq case in 1992, he has first-hand experience of ministers trying to suppress evidence by the use of PII certificates. The Matrix Churchill trial collapsed principally because evidence that the trial judge ordered to be disclosed revealed a Whitehall cover-up. Mr Justice Moses has already referred in an open court hearing to previous secrets trials where the defendants were acquitted. He has also described Col Wylde, who remains a reserve officer, as a special case. The Irish War describes the growing use of computers by military intelligence in identifying targets, including automatic photographing of vehicle registration plates. \"In Northern Ireland ... at least 1m names are now on some security agency's computer,\" Mr Geraghty wrote. Two other computer systems \"provide total cover of a largely innocent population\". He quoted an army document stating: \"The use of ever-increasing emerging technologies requires us to disguise the true nature of the devices.\"",

But the computer games company, Eidos , dropped 24p to 348.5p in reaction to the news that Sony has halved the initial roll-out of its long-awaited PlayStation2 video games console. In the small cap world, Utilitec gained 1.75p, or 11.29%, to \u00a317.25 after announcing a management buyout, and Affinity Internet rose 192.5p to \u00a313.50 as investors reacted positively to plans to raise \u00a321.25m through a placing and open offer.",

We're watching a live TV feed from the Big Brother house. Moran is explaining why a large cigarette being passed in silence round the sofa probably contains something more interesting than tobacco. </p> <p>\"They're using three papers. You'd never do that with a rollie\", he says. </p> <p>We watch, hypnotised, for some minutes. Then, reluctantly, Linehan switches off the television. </p> <p>We're supposed to be here to discuss the surreal new sitcom, Black Books, co-written by Linehan and Moran. It also stars Moran as a foul-tempered, dysfunctional bookshop owner.

      "bodyText": "\"They're definitely smoking dope\", says comedian Dylan Moran, staring intently at a television set sitting in the corner of a Channel 4 conference room. I'm sitting on a sweltering August afternoon with Moran and comedy writer Graham \"Father Ted\" Linehan. We're watching a live TV feed from the Big Brother house. Moran is explaining why a large cigarette being passed in silence round the sofa probably contains something more interesting than tobacco. \"They're using three papers. You'd never do that with a rollie\", he says. We watch, hypnotised, for some minutes. Then, reluctantly, Linehan switches off the television. We're supposed to be here to discuss the surreal new sitcom, Black Books, co-written by Linehan and Moran. It also stars Moran as a foul-tempered, dysfunctional bookshop owner. (Imagine High Fidelity crossed with Father Ted and you'll have a pretty good idea of where it's coming from.) Sitting together, Moran and Linehan make for a bizarre pairing. Moran, in real life, seems not a million miles from his stage and television personae: self-destructive characters, congenitally unable to cope with life (probably best displayed before now in the superb BBC2 comedy How Do You Want Me?)

From next week, in will come groovy 3D graphics designed to \"give the weather its own identity\".

Long gone are magnetic raindrops liable to slip off the map at the slightest over-excited gesture from a \"weather-caster\". </p> <p>Instead, we'll be treated to a \"fly-by view\" account of the prevailing winds using Jurassic Park-inspired technology. Yes, really! Expect scenes of teeny figures running for cover from raptor-like twisters in the east Midlands.

The weather is really changing because the BBC, that pioneer of the chubbiest cloud symbols in the western hemisphere, is revamping its weather bulletins. From next week, in will come groovy 3D graphics designed to \"give the weather its own identity\". And what's more, weather updates will look the same whether you see them on BBC1, BBC2, BBC Online, News 24 or BBC World (and if you know what that is you probably enjoy really nice weather as you'll be living abroad). For the Beeb, global warming means new challenges that need to be reflected in the 21st century. Long gone are magnetic raindrops liable to slip off the map at the slightest over-excited gesture from a \"weather-caster\". Instead, we'll be treated to a \"fly-by view\" account of the prevailing winds using Jurassic Park-inspired technology. Yes, really! Expect scenes of teeny figures running for cover from raptor-like twisters in the east Midlands. Don't expect Richard Attenborough. Even more compelling, the weather reports will feature more detail than ever about humidity and other potential horrors, including - and this is public service for you - tree pollen.

      "body": "<p>My husband and I are 75 years old. A year ago my husband was diagnosed as suffering from Lewy body dementia and I am still looking after a progressively confused and disabled husband. Once a week he is taken to a day centre. We cannot go on holiday, so in late October my husband is going into a residential home for two weeks, for the first time.</p> <p>My dilemma concerns our two married sons, who are in their 30s. The older lived at home until he was 23, and the younger came to stay with us for more than a year when his first marriage broke up. I adore my five grandchildren, but am not very close to my daughters-in-law.</p> <p>Since I am not able to baby-sit or entertain as I used to, we see less and less of both families even though they live locally. They offer or give no help whatsoever. I am so bewildered and sad and unable to understand why. Should I expect more from my sons?</p> <p><b> Be clear and realistic</b></p> <p>You've not made it clear if you have yet spoken to your sons about your situation. It could be that if you have not explained matters to them directly, they are not aware of your concerns. It is too easy when one has a partner, children, a job and whatever else to be negligent towards one's aging parents. After all, mum and dad are the ones who over the years usually offer assistance rather than the other way around.</p> <p>In short, you are talking about the reversal of habitual relationship roles with your children, something which my ailing parents and I are learning to do only slowly. You also have to be clear as to what you mean by \"expect more\" from them. A general assertion that you don't get enough from them is not a good way to open up discussion. Better yet is to raise specific points as to what you need and want, and to be realistic as to what can be done by them in balancing their own lives with providing greater support to you.</p> <p>Whatever you do, avoid emotional blackmail in highlighting how much you did for them in the past. Believe me, they already know. And you have to involve their wives in discussion, too. Although you say you aren't close to them, what you will be asking from your sons affects them and you don't want to encourage what may seem like an apparent choice in responsibilities for them between their parents and wives.</p> <p>Finally, consider carefully what assistance you will be needing as time goes on which your sons may not be able or willing to provide, and start making arrangements as soon as possible. Outside of being a wise course of action, it also may make it easier for your sons to provide assistance without feeling like, whatever they do, it won't be enough. This may encourage them to be more forthcoming in offering what help and support they can. <br><b>Name and address withheld </b></p> <p><b> Spell out your feelings </b></p> <p>Unfortunately for mothers, it appears that it is the daughters-in-law who determine how involved sons can be with their parents. My husband is only in contact with his mother because I maintain our relationship with her through phone calls and occasional visits. I am ashamed of his lack of interest in her and have said this to them both. She cries while he shrugs and glares at me.</p> <p>My mum always says, \"Children don't ask to be born. You don't have children to look after you in your old age.\" I agree, although her response is the result of psychological pressure from her mother, aged 95, who she and my father, in their 70s, care for full-time. The only help my brother and I can offer is to listen to their difficulties, with very occasional granny-sitting. I wish I could do more but know that my parents appreciate our interest and this makes them feel a little better. Feelings are the key here.</p> <p>No one should feel badly about expressing their needs. You obviously have had a good relationship with both sons. Invite them round together, without their wives. Show them your letter, and this reply if it helps. Tell them how much their involvement in your lives means to you because you love them. Spell out your feelings as objectively as possible. Ask how they feel they can help: possibly little more than phone calls and flying visits.</p> <p>The important thing is to communicate. Generally, men seem unable or unwilling to deal spontaneously and supportively with emotional needs. You've met their needs before so now ask for help in meeting some of yours, or you will feel more and more angry and alone, and will be unable to care for yourself and your husband effectively. <br><b>Name and address withheld </b></p> <p><b> Tell them you're upset</b></p> <p>My mother died 11 years ago (I'm 33 with two sisters), but it has only been in the past three or four years that I have really helped my father. I looked after my mother when she died but I didn't deal with my grief for years.</p> <p>Looking back, I can see that I was unable to accept my father's lonely and increasingly elderly situation. I will always feel ashamed that I did not do more for him in the first few difficult years. I think that your sons are grieving in a way (as I expect you are) for the father they have lost, for your youth and for their youth. I imagine they are also scared of this new situation.</p> <p>You should expect more - but you may have to ask. I wish my father had asked me for help - it might have jolted me into action sooner. You might need to find different ways to be together, where you can help each other (they could all come round for tea or perhaps it's their turn to \"parent-sit\").</p> <p>My experience is that my relationship with my father has been strengthened, and my worries about the responsibility or time that a more caring role would carry have been unfounded. Can you talk together about this huge change in all your lives?</p> <p>Tell your sons how sad you are that you don't see them often. I value my father's changed role in my life and have found real pleasure in being able to help him - this was unexpected. <br><b>Name and address withheld </b></p> <p><b> Be fun and have a party</b></p> <p>I became a care assistant when I was 59 and have just retired at 65. I learned a lot about people's attitudes towards their parents in that time. Some never visit, some visit every six months, others call in on a daily or weekly basis. A lot is to do with the relationship the parent had with the family originally.</p> <p>My advice? Throw a party, ring your daughters-in-law and ask them to help organise and decorate. If you can afford it, take a room at a local pub which does catering, and hire a disco. Phone members of your family you haven't contacted for years; nieces, nephews, brothers, sisters and friends; invite the grandchildren and any other kids.</p> <p>Have a party they'll remember. You read the Guardian so you can't be an old fogey, but perhaps you've given up being fun. Don't be negative and think of reasons you can't do it, and don't say it's impossible because of your husband. I'm sure if he were able, he'd tell you to go on living your life. Never be too proud to ask for help. <br><b>Joe Phillips, <br></b>Notts</p> <p><b>Next week</b></p> <p><b>I came from a hitherto close and loving family.

      "bodyText": "Italian police have discovered a massive international paedophile network selling violent child-pornography videos to clients in Italy, the US and Germany. Eight Italians have been arrested and 490 warned that they are under investigation, in a scandal that has shocked and outraged the country. Police are reportedly trying to identify 5,000 people who are suspected of attempting to purchase the videos, some of which appear to contain images of children being tortured and murdered. The tapes, which were made in Russia, have allegedly generated revenues of \u00a3410m for their makers. The directors of two state-run television news programmes resigned yesterday after brief excerpts of the paedophile videos were broadcast on Wednesday to illustrate reports. The images were apparently taken from internet sites promoting the pornographic films, which cost anything from \u00a3270 to \u00a34,000. Gad Lerner, the respected director of the main RAI One news programme, interrupted his broadcast to apologise to viewers for the \"ignoble\" and \"violent\" images that had been shown only minutes earlier. Mr Lerner and his RAI Tre counterpart, Nino Rizzo Nervo, admitted that they did not know what was going to be on the reports. Italian investigators have identified three Russians who are suspected of being at the heart of the traffic in violent films, which are promoted over the internet and distributed on video cassettes, CDs and DVDs. One of them, Dimitri Ivanov, has reportedly been in prison since September 1999, charged with violence against minors and the distribution of pornographic material. The other two, Dimitri Kuznetsov and Andrei Minaev, are said to have benefited from an amnesty passed by the Russian parliament. The investigation began two years ago following a denunciation by a parish priest from the Sicilian town of Avola, who runs a helpline for abused children. He found evidence of the traffic on the internet. Italian police identified the internet site that promoted the videos and intercepted 3,000 cassettes before they reached purchasers in Italy. The investigators named the Russian firms involved in the trade as Tim-O-Seev Video and Flower 2. Many of the tapes were duplicated and delivered to buyers by police who posed as postmen. Those arrested include businessmen and public employees. Exposure to the images has been a traumatic experience for police and magistrates. Alfredo Ormanni, the prosecutor in Torre Annunziata, near Naples, who is coordinating the inquiry, said they induced such a sense of desperation that he had been tempted to abandon his profession. \"For some time it has been possible to buy the sound files of rapes and every time that we discover one and report it to the police the screams of those children remain in my brain for days, and I blame myself for not being able to save them,\" said Father Fortunato Di Noto, whose denunciation began the investigation. Investigators said they believed that the victims shown in the films were kidnapped from orphanages in Russia and the Middle East.

Adrian Noble, the RSC's artistic director, has written to critics urging them to attend the national press night of a production in a leisure centre in Macclesfield, Cheshire. The Tempest opens on January 18 and launches the RSC's 21st mobile tour, which takes in 20 British towns, including Telford, St Austell in Cornwall, and Northallerton in North Yorkshire, plus Budapest, Lisbon, Porto and Virginia. The company takes to the road in five trucks laden with 500 seats, a lighting rig, sets and costumes, and sets up in halls in places which see little live theatre. Many in the audience will be seeing their first Shakespeare play. The Tempest will be seen at the Pit in London and The Other Place in Stratford before it hits the road, but Mr Noble is urging critics not to head for their familiar seats. \"I very much want you to experience the production in the environment for which it is particularly designed,\" he writes. \"The encounter you will have of the performances is a completely different experience to seeing it in one of our London or Stratford theatres.\" So far only two national newspaper journalists have accepted Mr Noble's invitation. \"The rest are probably still in shock and wondering where Macclesfield is,\" said a company spokeswoman.

It could also be the answer for a generation yet to work out how to programme existing videos. </p> <p>TiVo stores up to 40 hours of programmes on a hard drive, instead of a tape. The shows can be selected by choosing from onscreen programme guides, but it can also be set up to record a show's entire series, and can also search and record by genre or by the name of an actor. </p> <p>The UK version of the box retails for \u00a3399 for the recorder, plus either a \u00a310 monthly subscription or a one off payment of \u00a3199 for the personalised services. It will be available in high street electrical stores. </p> <p>It is being marketed alongside Rupert Murdoch-owned BSkyB, but users need not be subscribers to Sky - the system also works with conventional analogue TV as well as cable and On Digital. </p> <p>\"We are really changing the way people think about their TV,\" said Howard Look, vice-president of TiVo Studios. \"You never have to worry about missing your favourite programme, and, if they change the time of the broadcast, TiVo will know about it. </p> <p>\"There are also no more pesky video tapes, no worries about finding one that's blank or recording over your wedding video.\" </p> <p>The system has all the pause and rewind functions of a traditional video. And TiVo stores the programme a viewer is watching, allowing a live programme to be paused for up to 30 minutes and then be caught up; instant replays of live shows are also available. </p> <p>Perhaps the most advanced function of the box is the \"smart\" element that tracks what a viewer watches, whether it be tennis or costume drama, and records similar shows in the same genre. A fan of Pride and Prejudice for instance might find Vanity Fair has been stored. </p> <p>In the US 53,000 households have so far signed up. </p> <p>Fans of the technology suggest it will put an end to viewers being dictated to by schedulers. There is also some evidence viewers use TiVo to fast forward the majority of advertising. This worry for commercial channels has been dismissed by the Granada Media chairman, Charles Allen, who said: \"There has always been technology to allow you to skip the advertisements.

It is being marketed alongside Rupert Murdoch-owned BSkyB, but users need not be subscribers to Sky - the system also works with conventional analogue TV as well as cable and On Digital. \"We are really changing the way people think about their TV,\" said Howard Look, vice-president of TiVo Studios. \"You never have to worry about missing your favourite programme, and, if they change the time of the broadcast, TiVo will know about it. \"There are also no more pesky video tapes, no worries about finding one that's blank or recording over your wedding video.\" The system has all the pause and rewind functions of a traditional video. And TiVo stores the programme a viewer is watching, allowing a live programme to be paused for up to 30 minutes and then be caught up; instant replays of live shows are also available. Perhaps the most advanced function of the box is the \"smart\" element that tracks what a viewer watches, whether it be tennis or costume drama, and records similar shows in the same genre. A fan of Pride and Prejudice for instance might find Vanity Fair has been stored. In the US 53,000 households have so far signed up. Fans of the technology suggest it will put an end to viewers being dictated to by schedulers. There is also some evidence viewers use TiVo to fast forward the majority of advertising. This worry for commercial channels has been dismissed by the Granada Media chairman, Charles Allen, who said: \"There has always been technology to allow you to skip the advertisements. It's called the kettle.\"",

      "bodyText": "Britain is to coordinate an international effort into discovering how the Chernobyl disaster managed to cause a huge increase in child cancer. The project could lead to government guidelines such as advice to parents on giving children iodine in the event of a nuclear emergency. Under the scheme, announced in the journal Science, Cambridge University will make available to international researchers hundreds of samples from Chernobyl-related child cancer tumours held in Minsk, Kiev and Obninsk, outside Moscow. Until now, laboratories around the world have been unable to get hold of samples from enough children to carry out meaningful studies. Bureaucratic and political obstacles, such as the fact that the tissue banks are held in three countries - Belarus, Ukraine and Russia - have frustrated outside attempts to investigate the damage the nuclear disaster caused to unprotected civilians. Researchers will submit proposals to an international panel and if appproved, the Strangeways research laboratory in Cambridge will organise delivery of genetic material from the three tissue banks. Several dozen people, many of them firefighters, were killed by blasts of radiation in the immediate aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster. Catastrophe struck when a nuclear power station's reactor blew up in northern Ukraine in 1986 spreading a radioactive cloud across Europe. However, the only proven long term consequence of the disaster to nearby communities in Ukraine, Belarus and Russia apart from the psychological damage has been a huge increase in child thyroid cancer. Usually the disease strikes one in a million people a year but in Gomel, the region of Belarus which suffered worst from the disaster, the figure is 90 in a million each year. More than a thousand children and teenagers have been affected with about 200 new cases each year. Death is rare but sufferers must have their thyroid gland removed from their neck and take the drug thyroxin for the rest of their lives. Figures due out later this year suggest a decline in child cases but an increase in the disease among adolescents as those who were infants at the time of the disaster get older. Gerry Thomas, coordinator of the programme, said yesterday: \"This resource will for the first time allow scientists across the world to collaborate in studies of a large number of tumours for which the cause is undisputed. \"Ultimately it will enable us to develop much more informed preventative and therapeutic strategies should another nuclear accident occur.\" She was reluctant to comment on past difficulties of getting tissue sample. But one source familiar with the issue said: \"It's extremely difficult for westerners to get access because of the politics involved. Running this through the governments means access should be easier for the key people.\" The thyroid gland takes up iodine naturally. In the days after the accident, the wrecked Chernobyl reactor spewed out radioactive iodine, which lodged in the thyroids of babies and children. The cancers could easily have been prevented if parents had given their children iodine tablets immediately after the accident or even smeared a little household iodine on their throats. But it was days before the authorities admitted that there was anything wrong. Sir Dillwyn Williams, chairman of the panel overseeing the project, said research suggested that the very youngest children were at an even greater risk than previously thought from the radioactive iodine. He said that talks were under way with the Department of Health about changing the guidelines on giving iodine in the event of a nuclear disaster in Britain. \"Discussions are going on with the department here as to whether there should be a change in the dose level at which stable iodine is distributed in the light of the findings after Chernobyl,\" Sir Dillwyn said. Doctors in the affected regions insist that there is no evidence of any other Chernobyl-related cancer increase but governments have muddied the waters with misleading statistics. In Belarus, any child with cancer is automatically classified as a victim of Chernobyl. In Ukraine several years ago, the government included former Chernobyl clean-up workers who had died in traffic accidents in its list of victims of the disaster.",

Women taking the drug intermittently to cope with the effects benefited as much as women taking it continuously.

      "bodyText": "In our review of 100 great movies, page 11, G2, yesterday, we said that it was Sir Reginald Manningham-Buller who asked the jury in the Lady Chatterley case the famous question whether it was \"a book you would wish your wife or servants to read?\" It was, of course, Mervyn Griffith-Jones, the prosecution counsel. The writer to whom Arthur C Clarke paid his respects in the interview, page 6, G2, yesterday, was Olaf Stapledon (not Stapleton). Doctors stored the sperm of the profile subject, page 4, G2, September 27, because they feared his condition might leave him infertile, rather than impotent. Impotent: unable to have sexual intercourse; infertile: incapable of producing offspring (Collins). Murray Perahia played the Chopin Polonaise in A (Op 40 No 1), in his recital at the Bridgewater Hall, Manchester, Reviews, page 20, yesterday, and not what we said he played, the Polonaise in A Flat (which is Op 53). Danish department, from Pass Notes on Denmark, page 3, G2, yesterday, where we said we had \"a whole sm\u00f8rrebr\u00f8d of alternative dodgy cultural references\". Dodgy indeed. Sm\u00f8rrebr\u00f8d is the Danish for sandwich. We probably meant sm\u00f6rg sbord, which is not Danish, but Swedish for sandwich-table or buffet.

      "body": "<p>Her face remains, long after the charming flesh has bid farewell, returning still and exact to the mind's eye. Sophie Marceau is certainly beautiful. Beneath the misbehaving fringe, her features have the regular perfection that makes babies smile. Her lips are plump and mobile, her olive gaze soft. The thick, glossed hair tempts the fingers. Her skin is vital. </p> <p>But beauty is seldom openly self-aware. Marceau insists that she has no concept of her physical effect. \"No, never, because to be honest, I\" - she rummages in her bag for a lighter - \"I've never really been beautiful. I'm photogenic, which is very important, and now I'm getting older I'm aware I have to take care. I shouldn't smoke.\" She waves her still unlit cigarette. \"I'm transformable, and you can do all sorts of different styles with me.\" She snakes and flutters her hands around her face. \"I can be sexy or I can be not sexy at all. I don't want to be stuck in one thing, because I'm not myself one thing.\" </p> <p>Nor is 33-year-old Marceau without complexity beyond the surface. A truck driver's daughter from a dreary Parisian suburb, she made her acting debut at 13, in the coming-of-age film La Boum. It branded her on to the national consciousness. One of the few French actresses of her generation to attain international recognition, she has worked the arthouse circuit alongside Antonioni, Wenders, Deneuve and Depardieu as well as shimmering through Mel Gibson's Braveheart and the Bond blockbuster The World Is Not Enough. She is renowned both for her bemusing pens\u00e9es (she believes that only a woman can play Hamlet properly) and her bluntness. (When Leonardo DiCaprio intimated that he would like to work with her \"because she is as hot as it gets\", she laughed and told reporters: \"He's a child - is he 13? Or 11? Perhaps I could play his nanny.\") </p> <p>Her latest movie concerns the complexity of fidelity: to whom are we faithful, and how are we faithful to them? In La Fid\u00e9lit\u00e9, her character Cl\u00e9lia wrestles two conflicting connections - the hopeful, nourishing love she shares with her gentle husband and the visceral compulsion that draws her to a troubled, passionate colleague. Her indecision is, unfortunately, as tortuous as the pacing of the film, and ultimately both relationships are destroyed. </p> <p>\"You can't pretend you are anything other than human,\" muses Marceau, \"which means being full of contradictions. Life is always unexpected. Cl\u00e9lia has chosen faithfulness, but she is very tormented, and she's very tempted, because she's a woman , because life is full of attractions and easiness. According to the director, she is unfaithful. But I think she is faithful, because physically she is faithful, which is a huge step.\" </p> <p>Do men and women see physical and emotional fidelity differently? \"I wonder if it is deep in the feminine or masculine nature to be that way, or if it is because societies and rules and religions have imposed their way of ordering the world. In the last 50 years women have moved forward so much. If I look at my grandmother - my God! - she had 13 children, she had nothing to say at home, she wasn't happy, but there was no question of adultery or divorce because that wasn't how it was. </p> <p>\"Nowadays, we're thinking that women can change partners every week, but is it the reality? Have we really come out from those 800 years behind the stove? We are caught between the temptation of becoming somebody completely free, or trying to keep some of those rules that have been so difficult to live with for such a long time. It's not easy. We are at a crossroads now, and we have to walk with awareness.\" </p> <p>\"The director\" who doubts the unfaithful heart is in fact Marceau's partner, and father of her five-year-old son Vincent, namely Polish film-maker Andrzej Zulawski. La Fid\u00e9lit\u00e9 is their fourth collaboration. They fell in love when she was 18 and he was 42, when he first directed her as a teenage prostitute in L'Amour Braque, a modern interpretation of Dostoyevsky's The Idiot. Although she refers to him as her husband, the pair have never married. </p> <p>She enjoys the familiarity of working with him, she says. \"A director has to be a manipulator. It's like an orchestra. If you all play together without someone to give the rhythm, is it quick, is it slow, is it green, is it blue? You get lost. Somebody has to be strong. It's his movie. It's not my movie, it's my part. He loves that.\" She giggles gleefully. She refers to him by professional title, not personal relationship, and hints at a Pygmalion element to their partnership. \"He's a great mentor. He loves to be important in somebody's life, and I think I must too, because we've chosen to live together. A strong personality teaches you to be a strong personality. It doesn't teach you to be a marshmallow, otherwise he's going to get bored very quickly.\" </p> <p>Zulawski was reportedly apoplectic when Marceau accepted the role of kittenish villainess Electra King in The World Is Not Enough, considering the role of a Bond woman \"beneath her\". She now denies any disagreement, before adding the telling caveat: \"He never reads my scripts. That's too personal. He has a very strong temper and opinions, so if I want to have an opinion from him, I have to know already what I want.\" </p> <p>There is a blankness to Marceau the actress. Though a fluid player, she has none of the gut-given energy of the likes of her contemporary Romane Bohringer. Her on-screen containment is effortless rather than engaging, the reserve thickening for her English-speaking roles. When acting in her native tongue, she has a tendency to be cast in faux amour fou scenarios, playing women who enjoy anonymous, mildly painful sex then yield mistily to manifold psychic agonies or implode with puffy-lipped passion. </p> <p>She is often offered roles that comprise a male vision of female experience, she admits. \"Some of the most beautiful movies about women have been directed and written by men - Bergman, even Zulawski,\" she begins. (She has only been directed by a woman once in her career. V\u00e9ra Belmont cast her as the infamous Louis XIV courtesan Marquise du Parque in the 1997 film Marquise. Their relationship was not noted for its ease.) </p> <p>\"But sometimes you have to play somebody more stereotyped,\" she continues. \"I don't think stereotypes are wrong. From something shallow you can really do something,\" she argues gamely. \"If you are able to formulate the way you felt when you first read the script, it's great, because It becomes you, and you are unique.\" </p> <p>Her appearance as the girl in Michelangelo Antonioni's Beyond the Clouds in 1995 is arguably one such performance from shallow beginnings. She plays a practically dumb beauty, who bleakly confesses to the murder of her father before seducing the ever insouciant John Malkovich (who \"thinks he's really intellectual\" according to the tact-free mademoiselle). </p> <p>\"That was only for Antonioni,\" she says. \"You're going to think I'm very snob, but I have such admiration for his work. When I met him, he couldn't talk, he was sitting in a wheelchair, and it was very bizarre not to be able to communicate. (Antonioni suffered a stroke in 1985 which left him aphasic and severely limited in his speech. Wim Wenders collaborated with him to make the film.) </p> <p>\"But I could tell at first sight that he was a director,\" she states, with the same breathy emphasis that she earlier placed on \"woman\". \"He had a particular grace and light. I didn't like the movie, to be honest, so why? Because I was hypnotised by him, because he's so strong as a director, even though he couldn't talk, like Kaa in The Jungle Book. He could have asked me to do anything ... terrible!\" she concludes with relish. </p> <p>Whether Marceau's other-continental appeal can appease diplomacy-hungry Hollywood remains in the balance. She is clearly uncomfortable with the studio roundelay: \"The worst thing is when you have a meeting with a director and he's looking at you like you're the fifth girl he's seen that day. You feel he doesn't understand, you feel terrible afterwards, like you want to go and have a shower.\" She shudders, delighted by the fact that Universal were \"obliged\" to take her for the Bond film on the insistence of director Michael Apted, despite their reservations about her bankability. </p> <p> In her native France, meanwhile, Marceau's status remains stellar. The country offers limitless forgiveness to the woman who, according to a Paris-Match poll, most French men would like to take to bed, despite the fact that she has dismissed its film industry as \"too slow, too pretentious\", Paris as \"insular\" and the populace as \"more conservative every day\". She is a national institution, accompanying the president on an official visit to South Korea, while remaining a billboard regular in varying states of undress. </p> <p>Nudity, she tells me, is hardly the point. \"Sex belongs to life, very much so,\" she says evenly. \"The cinema is to talk about everything, and people have problems talking about sex. It is more difficult for me to talk about sex in my private life than in the movies, but I think it's healthy to talk openly about it because otherwise it can cause pain. </p> <p>\"But technically speaking, love scenes are like any other scenes.

      "bodyText": "Her face remains, long after the charming flesh has bid farewell, returning still and exact to the mind's eye. Sophie Marceau is certainly beautiful. Beneath the misbehaving fringe, her features have the regular perfection that makes babies smile. Her lips are plump and mobile, her olive gaze soft. The thick, glossed hair tempts the fingers. Her skin is vital. But beauty is seldom openly self-aware. Marceau insists that she has no concept of her physical effect. \"No, never, because to be honest, I\" - she rummages in her bag for a lighter - \"I've never really been beautiful. I'm photogenic, which is very important, and now I'm getting older I'm aware I have to take care. I shouldn't smoke.\" She waves her still unlit cigarette. \"I'm transformable, and you can do all sorts of different styles with me.\" She snakes and flutters her hands around her face. \"I can be sexy or I can be not sexy at all. I don't want to be stuck in one thing, because I'm not myself one thing.\" Nor is 33-year-old Marceau without complexity beyond the surface. A truck driver's daughter from a dreary Parisian suburb, she made her acting debut at 13, in the coming-of-age film La Boum. It branded her on to the national consciousness. One of the few French actresses of her generation to attain international recognition, she has worked the arthouse circuit alongside Antonioni, Wenders, Deneuve and Depardieu as well as shimmering through Mel Gibson's Braveheart and the Bond blockbuster The World Is Not Enough. She is renowned both for her bemusing pens\u00e9es (she believes that only a woman can play Hamlet properly) and her bluntness. (When Leonardo DiCaprio intimated that he would like to work with her \"because she is as hot as it gets\", she laughed and told reporters: \"He's a child - is he 13? Or 11? Perhaps I could play his nanny.\") Her latest movie concerns the complexity of fidelity: to whom are we faithful, and how are we faithful to them? In La Fid\u00e9lit\u00e9, her character Cl\u00e9lia wrestles two conflicting connections - the hopeful, nourishing love she shares with her gentle husband and the visceral compulsion that draws her to a troubled, passionate colleague. Her indecision is, unfortunately, as tortuous as the pacing of the film, and ultimately both relationships are destroyed. \"You can't pretend you are anything other than human,\" muses Marceau, \"which means being full of contradictions. Life is always unexpected. Cl\u00e9lia has chosen faithfulness, but she is very tormented, and she's very tempted, because she's a woman , because life is full of attractions and easiness. According to the director, she is unfaithful. But I think she is faithful, because physically she is faithful, which is a huge step.\" Do men and women see physical and emotional fidelity differently? \"I wonder if it is deep in the feminine or masculine nature to be that way, or if it is because societies and rules and religions have imposed their way of ordering the world. In the last 50 years women have moved forward so much. If I look at my grandmother - my God! - she had 13 children, she had nothing to say at home, she wasn't happy, but there was no question of adultery or divorce because that wasn't how it was. \"Nowadays, we're thinking that women can change partners every week, but is it the reality? Have we really come out from those 800 years behind the stove? We are caught between the temptation of becoming somebody completely free, or trying to keep some of those rules that have been so difficult to live with for such a long time. It's not easy. We are at a crossroads now, and we have to walk with awareness.\" \"The director\" who doubts the unfaithful heart is in fact Marceau's partner, and father of her five-year-old son Vincent, namely Polish film-maker Andrzej Zulawski.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>By the age of 30, Rainer Werner Fassbinder was already a major figure in European cinema. But the apprenticeship of this man of gargantuan appetites - both artistic and sexual - who had completed more than 40 feature films by the time of his death at 37, was in the theatre. In 1967, he joined Peer Raben's Action Theatre, a feckless group with premises in an old 60-seater cinema in Munich. The precocious 22-year-old quickly took over the direction of the group. His first production was B\u00fcchner's Leonce and Lena, in which he also acted. </p> <p>Now the French director Fran\u00e7ois Ozon has filmed Fassbinder's first play, Water Drops on Burning Rocks, which he wrote at the age of 19. It was not staged until 1985, two years after his death from a drug overdose. </p> <p>As with any early work by a great talent, the play has been subjected to great scrutiny and an exaggerated amount of respect. In reality, but for the outrageous ending, it is a rather hackeneyed description of a banal domestic relationship - which happens to be homosexual. A young man of artistic leanings is willingly seduced by an older, dominating man and goes to live with him. The older man's interest palls; the young man's fianc\u00e9e comes to rescue her boy but is willingly seduced by the older man. Then the older man's stricken former wife arrives and reluctantly joins in the orgy. </p> <p>Ozon tacitly admits the weakness of this piece by reinforcing it with an idea taken from a 1978 Fassbinder film, In a Year of 13 Moons. In Ozon's film, the ex-wife is revealed to be a transsexual who had the operation in the vain hope of holding the interest of her cynical lover. In the original, a man castrates himself because of his obsessive need to conform to society. It was the evils spawned by conformity that obsessed Fassbinder, who regarded it as a plague. </p> <p>There is ambivalence in Fassbinder's attitude to the exploitation of women. In his 1969 theatrical version of the Bertolt Brecht/John Gay Beggar's Opera (with Fassbinder playing Mack the Knife), he introduced an original song for the prostitutes - Two Dozen Cocks Every Day (That's the Only Way), which could be seen as a bitter indictment of exploitation. But it was claimed that in real life, he persuaded some of the more hopelessly admiring women in his group to \"entertain\" men to raise funds for his projects. </p> <p>Perhaps Fassbinder's most significant production of this early period, politically at least, was Axel Caesar Harrmann, an attack on the Springer press, which ruthlessly hounded the left in Germany. An ensemble piece, it was a response to the assassination attempt on Rudi Dutschke, which left the young radical leader permanently incapacitated. </p> <p>At this time, Fassbinder and his Action Theatre might well have gone down a very different and lethal path. His theatre could be said to have been the cradle of the German terrorist movement of the 60s and 70s. One of its members - or hangers-on - was the subsequently notorious Andreas Baader. Baader, though, is said to have spent most of his time writing political slogans rather than engaging in theatre. </p> <p>One night in 1967, another member of the group, Horst S\u00f6hnlein, was enraged to find on returning from hospital after a car accident that his wife, like many of the company, of both sexes, was having an affair with Fassbinder. He ran amok and wrecked the theatre. Baader had been complaining that what was needed was action, not action theatre and the next night, joined by Baader, S\u00f6hnlein set fire to two department stores. American bases followed, and the Baader-Meinhof gang's campaign was underway. </p> <p>Fassbinder's Danish biographer, Christian Braad Thomsen, maintains that Fassbinder was always against terrorism and that many of his films bear this out. \"Fassbinder made some of his most important films from the standpoint that terrorism derives less from a clear political position than from private frustration,\" he writes. \"It was not only a product of the society being fought, but in fact strengthened it.\" </p> <p>These themes were already dealt with in his The Burning Village (1970), a stage adaptation of Lope de Vega's Fuente Ovejuna. A village lives under a reign of terror dominated by a commander who murders and rapes. The villagers rebel and capture the commander; the women castrate him and the villagers eat his body. Arrested and brought before the king, the villagers are asked who was resonsible. They reply, \"Fuente Ovejuna!\" - the name of the village. This expression of solidarity and the impossibility of identifying the murderer persuades the king to let them off. But the rebels attack the court and eat the courtiers. Lope de Vega did not carry it this far, but Fassbinder's message is clear: revolutionaries become as oppressive as their oppressors. </p> <p>After 18 months, the Action Theatre was no more. The authorities used safety regulations to evict the troupe, although it was clearly their political stance that troubled them. Partly to distance himself from his lethal hangers-on, Fassbinder rechristened his group Antitheater. They were given hospitality in the B\u00fcchner theatre, but the tenancy was short-lived. Fassbinder staged P\u00e8re Ubu, an already notoriously subversive work. But even Alfred Jarry's irreverence was not sufficient for him; he introduced a middle-class family reunion which ends with an orgy. The director of the theatre was so horrified that he turned off the lights in mid-action. </p> <p> The company then took up residence in the back room of a pub in the Schwabing district of Munich. Finally, in 1974, Fassbinder achieved his ambition to have a theatre of his own. The man recognised as the cultural authority of Frankfurt, Hilmar Hoffmann, invited Fassbinder to become artistic director of the Theater am Turm, Frankfurt's centre for the performing arts. Hoffmann had already offended Fassbinder deeply by turning down his short films for the Oberhausen festival. Conflict was inevitable. </p> <p>Fassbinder staged a notable Uncle Vanya and Zola's Germinal, but ran into trouble with a production called Garbage, the City and Death, when he was accused - unjustly - of antisemitism. In adapting the novel by Gerhard Zwerenz, Fassbinder carelessly kept the nickname of the villainous landlord who strangles the prostitute heroine - The Rich Jew. The production was stopped and Fassbinder resigned in protest. He later made it into a film, Shadow of Angels. </p> <p>By this time, Fassbinder was said to have become disillusioned with the stage. He put on one more play for the Hamburg theatre, surprisingly a version of Clare Booth Luce's The Women. He went on to make, among others, The Marriage of Maria Braun, and Berlin-Alexanderplatz, a television series shown in Britain, both widely regarded as masterpieces. </p> <p>Even in the turmoil of the Antitheatre, he found time to make a critically acclaimed feature film, Love is Colder Than Death. In a time awash with naive notions of art and political liberation, he was fooled neither by the bombast of simplistic radical theatre nor by the utopian illusions of terrorists. </p> <p>In 1969 he gave the then very fashionable American Living Theatre a rather gentle - for him - comeuppance. He followed Julian Beck and Judith Malina's controversial Paradise Now - a denunciation of the American way of life in which the actors stripped and invited the audience to join them for some hugging on stage - with Preparadise Sorry Now. The original was stopped by the police at the Avignon festival on grounds of indecency. But Fassbinder's complaint was that it was \"too religious\" - a good enough description of the witless, evangelical level to which the nomadic Living Theatre had sunk by this time. </p> <p>Fassbinder's version upped the stakes considerably: it offered six murder stories, one featuring Ian Brady and Myra Hindley, pretty strong stuff so close to the revelation of the murders in 1965. It also contained the blasphemous liturgical and cannibalistic elements that featured in much of his theatre work. </p> <p>Fassbinder was certainly orgiastic and exploitative; he married a couple of his actresses and lived with others, without ever relinquishing his bisexuality. But, unlike Wim Wenders and Volker Schl\u00f6ndorff, he never went international, preferring to remain a big fish in his own native cesspool. </p> <p> \u0095 Water Drops on Burning Rocks is released on October 6.</p>",

Baader had been complaining that what was needed was action, not action theatre and the next night, joined by Baader, S\u00f6hnlein set fire to two department stores. American bases followed, and the Baader-Meinhof gang's campaign was underway. Fassbinder's Danish biographer, Christian Braad Thomsen, maintains that Fassbinder was always against terrorism and that many of his films bear this out. \"Fassbinder made some of his most important films from the standpoint that terrorism derives less from a clear political position than from private frustration,\" he writes. \"It was not only a product of the society being fought, but in fact strengthened it.\" These themes were already dealt with in his The Burning Village (1970), a stage adaptation of Lope de Vega's Fuente Ovejuna. A village lives under a reign of terror dominated by a commander who murders and rapes. The villagers rebel and capture the commander; the women castrate him and the villagers eat his body. Arrested and brought before the king, the villagers are asked who was resonsible. They reply, \"Fuente Ovejuna!\" - the name of the village. This expression of solidarity and the impossibility of identifying the murderer persuades the king to let them off. But the rebels attack the court and eat the courtiers. Lope de Vega did not carry it this far, but Fassbinder's message is clear: revolutionaries become as oppressive as their oppressors. After 18 months, the Action Theatre was no more. The authorities used safety regulations to evict the troupe, although it was clearly their political stance that troubled them. Partly to distance himself from his lethal hangers-on, Fassbinder rechristened his group Antitheater. They were given hospitality in the B\u00fcchner theatre, but the tenancy was short-lived. Fassbinder staged P\u00e8re Ubu, an already notoriously subversive work. But even Alfred Jarry's irreverence was not sufficient for him; he introduced a middle-class family reunion which ends with an orgy. The director of the theatre was so horrified that he turned off the lights in mid-action. The company then took up residence in the back room of a pub in the Schwabing district of Munich. Finally, in 1974, Fassbinder achieved his ambition to have a theatre of his own. The man recognised as the cultural authority of Frankfurt, Hilmar Hoffmann, invited Fassbinder to become artistic director of the Theater am Turm, Frankfurt's centre for the performing arts. Hoffmann had already offended Fassbinder deeply by turning down his short films for the Oberhausen festival. Conflict was inevitable. Fassbinder staged a notable Uncle Vanya and Zola's Germinal, but ran into trouble with a production called Garbage, the City and Death, when he was accused - unjustly - of antisemitism. In adapting the novel by Gerhard Zwerenz, Fassbinder carelessly kept the nickname of the villainous landlord who strangles the prostitute heroine - The Rich Jew. The production was stopped and Fassbinder resigned in protest. He later made it into a film, Shadow of Angels. By this time, Fassbinder was said to have become disillusioned with the stage. He put on one more play for the Hamburg theatre, surprisingly a version of Clare Booth Luce's The Women. He went on to make, among others, The Marriage of Maria Braun, and Berlin-Alexanderplatz, a television series shown in Britain, both widely regarded as masterpieces. Even in the turmoil of the Antitheatre, he found time to make a critically acclaimed feature film, Love is Colder Than Death. In a time awash with naive notions of art and political liberation, he was fooled neither by the bombast of simplistic radical theatre nor by the utopian illusions of terrorists. In 1969 he gave the then very fashionable American Living Theatre a rather gentle - for him - comeuppance. He followed Julian Beck and Judith Malina's controversial Paradise Now - a denunciation of the American way of life in which the actors stripped and invited the audience to join them for some hugging on stage - with Preparadise Sorry Now. The original was stopped by the police at the Avignon festival on grounds of indecency. But Fassbinder's complaint was that it was \"too religious\" - a good enough description of the witless, evangelical level to which the nomadic Living Theatre had sunk by this time. Fassbinder's version upped the stakes considerably: it offered six murder stories, one featuring Ian Brady and Myra Hindley, pretty strong stuff so close to the revelation of the murders in 1965. It also contained the blasphemous liturgical and cannibalistic elements that featured in much of his theatre work. Fassbinder was certainly orgiastic and exploitative; he married a couple of his actresses and lived with others, without ever relinquishing his bisexuality. But, unlike Wim Wenders and Volker Schl\u00f6ndorff, he never went international, preferring to remain a big fish in his own native cesspool. \u0095 Water Drops on Burning Rocks is released on October 6.",

Real nightclubs are large Asda-style sheds, packed with blotchy, incoherent teenagers falling into one another. Who, save a few Harmony Korine fans, is going to want to watch that? </p> <p>Because nightclub scenes in films long ago surrendered any notion of reality, they've formed a parallel universe of their own, where LA punks burn oil drums in warehouses, jazz bars drip girls from every furnishing, and raves are crammed with beautiful fashionistas, punching the air to a cameo from Judge Jules. From Casablanca to The Matrix, nightclub scenes have come to form a body of work in their own right - one which refers back to its own lineage rather than anything approximating reality, and can be enjoyed for the ludicrous fantasy world it is. </p> <p>The Citizen Kane of club scenes is Basic Instinct, in which Michael Douglas, playing an Andrew Neil-lookalike in V-neck jumper and no shirt (a sweaty fashion detail signifying middle-aged man smelling out sex) watches Sharon Stone, who taunts his manhood by indulging in a faux-lesbian sex dance. </p> <p>The sequence is tragic in about 57 specific ways yet it comes across as one of the most enjoyable club scenes of all time. It captures the dripping seediness and sexual frisson of a cheap venue like few other movies, and is truer to the cold, calculating desperation of the solitary punter than the raft-full of arm-waving rave movies. </p> <p>Basic Instinct is true to the spirit of clubs, rather than hung-up on details of cool. In this respect, its effect - even more so than the out-and-out spoof, Austin Powers - is less ridiculous than a serious stab at 70s v\u00e9rit\u00e9 like 54 or Velvet Goldmine, both of which came across as bad school plays. When Powers enters a club, he quotes from Russ Meyer's Beyond the Valley of the Dolls: \"This is my scene and it's freaking me out.\" A homage to an era of groovy film-making that spoofed itself to begin with. </p> <p>Like Austin Powers, Larry Clark's Kids acknowledged its cinematic lineage by retelling the Saturday Night Fever story 20 years on.

But while it's easy to laugh at the casting, Donovan is undoubtedly the Dennis Hopper of rave - with a permanent 1,000-yard stare induced by over-exposure to Joseph's multi-coloured dreamcoat no doubt.

      "body": "<p>Not many people look at the recent rise in car-leasing or fusion music and see a threat to civilisation, but Jeremy Rifkin does. Then again, he also believes that the 21st century - this apparently booming era - will witness the decline and fall of market-based capitalism. </p> <p>These are the sort of jeremiads normally voiced by shaggy, wild-eyed men touting hand-painted omens of doom. But Rifkin, America's best-known techno-sceptic, is speaking from the very heart of the capitalist system. </p> <p>He does not look like a seer. He is a bald middle-aged man in a suit and tie. The only remaining hint of his days as a Vietnam-era peace activist is a greying moustache. Rifkin is now a fellow at Wharton, the most prestigious business school in the US, probably the world - a temple, bar none, to the power of market forces. And he spends much of his working life counselling the chief executives of corporate America. </p> <p>Yet the 55-year-old academic and professional visionary has emerged as a lonely voice on the US intellectual stage, cautioning the west against its eager embrace of bio-technology. His single-minded struggle against powerful biotech giants such as Monsanto has made him some powerful enemies, and he has been dismissed as a publicity-conscious Luddite. But many of his early warnings now appear prophetic. </p> <p>He campaigned successfully for better hygiene laws governing the handling of meat and poultry in the US, long before food safety became a international front-page issue. And 13 years ago, he raised the alarm over an obscure decision by the US patent office to grant corporate proprietary rights over certain human genes, paving the way for the current ethical dilemmas swirling around the biotech industry. He has appeared regularly before Congress, and flew to France last year to bolster the French government's resistance to the import of genetically modified (GM) foods. </p> <p>Now Rifkin is raising a new spectre. His latest book, The Age of Access, (published in Britain this week), examines current trends in the way we live and do business, and extrapolates from them into the future. He comes up with some surprising conclusions. </p> <p>This is Rifkin's theory: With the spread of the internet and e-commerce, markets and lifestyles in the western world are accelerating to such an extent that they are triggering a fundamental change in our economic system. The ownership of physical property, which was once the bulwark of capitalism has become a burden to businesses and individuals alike, a liability rather than an asset. </p> <p>Consumers increasingly prefer to lease rather than buy big items such as cars, so they can continually upgrade them and avoid the pitfalls and responsibilities of ownership. </p> <p>Businesses meanwhile are finding there is less and less of a profit margin in selling things. Rather than a one-off transaction lasting minutes or seconds, they want to establish a life-long relationship with you, providing the car (or the lawnmower, the computer, the telephone or even the house) on a lease basis as an introductory transaction in a long stream of related goods and services. </p> <p>\"Ford would rather never sell you a car again,\" Rifkin argues. \"It would rather put you in its network, so that you continually buy the experience of driving rather than buying the vehicle. And the proof is in the pudding. The renewal rate on leasing is 54%. The renewal rate in market-based transactions is 25%.\" </p> <p>Eighty per cent of US companies are now leasing some or all equipment rather than investing in ownership. Whereas old-style companies, such as General Motors, owned a lot of solid assets, the new industrial icons, such as Nike, own hardly anything in physical terms, yet Nike is priced much higher on the New York stock exchange. Its production is \"outsourced\" - carried out by \"partners\" in the developing world. Rifkin describes it as a \"virtual company\". Its assets are almost entirely cerebral - it is selling a concept and a lifestyle, and in this new economy those are valued far above factories and headquarters. </p> <p>In capitalist markets, buyers and sellers come together to exchange property, but in this new system ownership does not change hands. Instead, users pay for access to experiences from suppliers. In place of markets, there are networks - arrays of companies supplying any experience you could wish for and supplying access to it in the form of subscriptions, leases, or membership schemes. </p> <p>From his suite of offices in downtown Washington, the prophet of the Age of Access is forecasting nothingless than the demise of the market as we know it </p> <p>\"What I'm suggesting in this book is eventually the nature of this technological revolution is leading us into an era where, by the mid part of the 21st century, market capitalism will have virtually disappeared,\" Rifkin argued in an interview. \"It will be there, but it will be only an appendage to a new network-based economy with access relations replacing property relations.\" </p> <p>The problem with this brave new world is that with all this packaging of lifestyles and experiences, pretty soon every part of our daily existence, once rooted in family or community, becomes a commodity that is sold back to us. </p> <p>Imagine, Rifkin says: \"You find virtually every activity you engage inside the family and outside the family is a paid-for commercial activity. We are commodified. We're moving from commodifying goods and services to comodifying culture.\" </p> <p>This is where the \"fusion\" music comes in. Just as the multinational giants of the 19th and 20th centuries scoured the planet for mineral wealth and cash crops, today's mega-corporations - AOL-Time Warner, Disney and the like - go searching for culture to mine and turn into easily digestible experiences for their users to access. Thus \"ethnic\" music from around the world is sampled and fused with rock and pop and turned into \"fusion\", making it accessible while tearing it from the roots from its culture. </p> <p>\"One of the messages here is that it's just as possible to deplete cultural diversity as it is biological diversity and physical resources. When you take a culture and homogenise it, transform it, package it and sell it back to people as a paid-for experience, then it is just as possible to deplete cultural diversity as biodiversity,\" Rifkin argues. \"And when you lose a culture to extinction it's just as final, you cannot get it back.\" </p> <p>In the cultural vacuum which results, fundamentalism blooms. In Rifkin's view, Blair and his fellow travellers along the third way have failed to see the threat because of their materialist outlook on life. </p> <p>\"Third way politics thinks that if you can build a healthy economy which is compassionate, you'll build a healthy society. My position in this book is that they are wrong from the get-go, because commerce never precedes culture, culture always precedes commerce.\" </p> <p>Rifkin's remedy is to pay more attention to fostering culture, particularly local culture, by promoting community-based education in an attempt to provide children with a deeper understanding of the world than computer screens alone can provide. </p> <p>The arguments are taut and provocative, but are they sane? Is our way of life really under threat because we decide to lease rather than buy. The book has received some harsh criticism at the hands of US journalists, who portray Rifkin as an overblown Cassandra, predicting the end of the world as we know it at every half-opportunity. </p> <p>His last book but one was called The End of Work, in which Rifkin, in characteristic apocalyptic style, predicted that manufacturing would become \"near-workerless\" in the near future, with the explosive growth in automation. Since the book was published in 1995, however, US unemployment has fallen significantly. </p> <p>Rifkin insists he did not get it wrong. In a somewhat defensive revised introduction to The End of Work, he points out that the US labour department has massaged the figures, that 2% of the adult male workforce is currently in prison and that the US has been able to keep its boom going artificially through the use of cheap credit. </p> <p>He has also come under fire from the left for focusing on the dilemmas of the wealthy world, for talking about the Age of Access when, as Rifkin himself points out, 62% of the world's population have never even made a telephone call. Rifkin points out, however, that he is simply examining the markets which matter to big business.

      "bodyText": "Not many people look at the recent rise in car-leasing or fusion music and see a threat to civilisation, but Jeremy Rifkin does. Then again, he also believes that the 21st century - this apparently booming era - will witness the decline and fall of market-based capitalism. These are the sort of jeremiads normally voiced by shaggy, wild-eyed men touting hand-painted omens of doom. But Rifkin, America's best-known techno-sceptic, is speaking from the very heart of the capitalist system. He does not look like a seer. He is a bald middle-aged man in a suit and tie. The only remaining hint of his days as a Vietnam-era peace activist is a greying moustache. Rifkin is now a fellow at Wharton, the most prestigious business school in the US, probably the world - a temple, bar none, to the power of market forces. And he spends much of his working life counselling the chief executives of corporate America. Yet the 55-year-old academic and professional visionary has emerged as a lonely voice on the US intellectual stage, cautioning the west against its eager embrace of bio-technology. His single-minded struggle against powerful biotech giants such as Monsanto has made him some powerful enemies, and he has been dismissed as a publicity-conscious Luddite. But many of his early warnings now appear prophetic. He campaigned successfully for better hygiene laws governing the handling of meat and poultry in the US, long before food safety became a international front-page issue. And 13 years ago, he raised the alarm over an obscure decision by the US patent office to grant corporate proprietary rights over certain human genes, paving the way for the current ethical dilemmas swirling around the biotech industry. He has appeared regularly before Congress, and flew to France last year to bolster the French government's resistance to the import of genetically modified (GM) foods. Now Rifkin is raising a new spectre. His latest book, The Age of Access, (published in Britain this week), examines current trends in the way we live and do business, and extrapolates from them into the future. He comes up with some surprising conclusions. This is Rifkin's theory: With the spread of the internet and e-commerce, markets and lifestyles in the western world are accelerating to such an extent that they are triggering a fundamental change in our economic system. The ownership of physical property, which was once the bulwark of capitalism has become a burden to businesses and individuals alike, a liability rather than an asset. Consumers increasingly prefer to lease rather than buy big items such as cars, so they can continually upgrade them and avoid the pitfalls and responsibilities of ownership. Businesses meanwhile are finding there is less and less of a profit margin in selling things. Rather than a one-off transaction lasting minutes or seconds, they want to establish a life-long relationship with you, providing the car (or the lawnmower, the computer, the telephone or even the house) on a lease basis as an introductory transaction in a long stream of related goods and services. \"Ford would rather never sell you a car again,\" Rifkin argues. \"It would rather put you in its network, so that you continually buy the experience of driving rather than buying the vehicle. And the proof is in the pudding. The renewal rate on leasing is 54%. The renewal rate in market-based transactions is 25%.\" Eighty per cent of US companies are now leasing some or all equipment rather than investing in ownership. Whereas old-style companies, such as General Motors, owned a lot of solid assets, the new industrial icons, such as Nike, own hardly anything in physical terms, yet Nike is priced much higher on the New York stock exchange. Its production is \"outsourced\" - carried out by \"partners\" in the developing world. Rifkin describes it as a \"virtual company\". Its assets are almost entirely cerebral - it is selling a concept and a lifestyle, and in this new economy those are valued far above factories and headquarters. In capitalist markets, buyers and sellers come together to exchange property, but in this new system ownership does not change hands. Instead, users pay for access to experiences from suppliers. In place of markets, there are networks - arrays of companies supplying any experience you could wish for and supplying access to it in the form of subscriptions, leases, or membership schemes. From his suite of offices in downtown Washington, the prophet of the Age of Access is forecasting nothingless than the demise of the market as we know it \"What I'm suggesting in this book is eventually the nature of this technological revolution is leading us into an era where, by the mid part of the 21st century, market capitalism will have virtually disappeared,\" Rifkin argued in an interview. \"It will be there, but it will be only an appendage to a new network-based economy with access relations replacing property relations.\" The problem with this brave new world is that with all this packaging of lifestyles and experiences, pretty soon every part of our daily existence, once rooted in family or community, becomes a commodity that is sold back to us. Imagine, Rifkin says: \"You find virtually every activity you engage inside the family and outside the family is a paid-for commercial activity. We are commodified. We're moving from commodifying goods and services to comodifying culture.\" This is where the \"fusion\" music comes in. Just as the multinational giants of the 19th and 20th centuries scoured the planet for mineral wealth and cash crops, today's mega-corporations - AOL-Time Warner, Disney and the like - go searching for culture to mine and turn into easily digestible experiences for their users to access. Thus \"ethnic\" music from around the world is sampled and fused with rock and pop and turned into \"fusion\", making it accessible while tearing it from the roots from its culture. \"One of the messages here is that it's just as possible to deplete cultural diversity as it is biological diversity and physical resources. When you take a culture and homogenise it, transform it, package it and sell it back to people as a paid-for experience, then it is just as possible to deplete cultural diversity as biodiversity,\" Rifkin argues. \"And when you lose a culture to extinction it's just as final, you cannot get it back.\" In the cultural vacuum which results, fundamentalism blooms. In Rifkin's view, Blair and his fellow travellers along the third way have failed to see the threat because of their materialist outlook on life. \"Third way politics thinks that if you can build a healthy economy which is compassionate, you'll build a healthy society. My position in this book is that they are wrong from the get-go, because commerce never precedes culture, culture always precedes commerce.\" Rifkin's remedy is to pay more attention to fostering culture, particularly local culture, by promoting community-based education in an attempt to provide children with a deeper understanding of the world than computer screens alone can provide. The arguments are taut and provocative, but are they sane? Is our way of life really under threat because we decide to lease rather than buy. The book has received some harsh criticism at the hands of US journalists, who portray Rifkin as an overblown Cassandra, predicting the end of the world as we know it at every half-opportunity. His last book but one was called The End of Work, in which Rifkin, in characteristic apocalyptic style, predicted that manufacturing would become \"near-workerless\" in the near future, with the explosive growth in automation. Since the book was published in 1995, however, US unemployment has fallen significantly. Rifkin insists he did not get it wrong. In a somewhat defensive revised introduction to The End of Work, he points out that the US labour department has massaged the figures, that 2% of the adult male workforce is currently in prison and that the US has been able to keep its boom going artificially through the use of cheap credit. He has also come under fire from the left for focusing on the dilemmas of the wealthy world, for talking about the Age of Access when, as Rifkin himself points out, 62% of the world's population have never even made a telephone call. Rifkin points out, however, that he is simply examining the markets which matter to big business. Would it have been wrong to study the first stirrings of the industrial revolution in the English Midlands because it was not a worldwide phenomenon? Rifkin does seem to ignore or at least play down trends which con flict with his central theory - like the growth in ownership of homes and securities among the burgeoning middle classes. In some ways the desire to own is clearly deepening rather than eroding. However, he is pointing to significant changes in the way our economic system operates. A quick glance at prices on the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq index will demonstrate the increasing importance of intangible, cerebral assets over physical capital. When Steven Spielberg's company, DreamWorks SKG opened for business it owned practically nothing other than the talent of its founders but its stock was valued instantly at $2bn. Meanwhile on the land, US farmers are no longer buying seeds but effectively leasing them from \"life-science\" companies which own the patent on the crops' very DNA. Once the first harvest is in, the farmers have no ownership rights over the seeds, which remain the intellectual property of the biotech firm and its commercial network which will typically supply the farmers with pesticide, weedkiller and fertiliser. It is arguably the most radical change to hit agriculture since the stone age. With the use of patents, commercial networks in Rifkin's Age of Access can potentially exercise far more control than old-fashioned monopolies in the age of production, and the current anti-trust laws - drawn up in a bygone era - are ill-equipped to regulate them. In the end the threat of that scale of economic dominance - wielded by biotech companies such as Monsanto, or entertainment conglomerates like AOL-Time Warner - may turn out to be far more potent than Rifkin's warnings about vehicle-leasing and \"fusion\" music.

      "body": "<p>What year is it anyway? 2000 or 1973? It was a little hard to tell from last weekend's box office receipts. The two most successful movies - The Exorcist and Almost Famous - were originally released and retrospectively set in the year that Opec fuel price rises put a sudden end to the longest economic boom in history (hey, wait a minute...), a year characterised by global political unrest and a sense that our elected leaders were either totally clueless or totally corrupt. </p> <p>Turned out they were both. So, give or take the intervening invention of the VCR, the DVD, the microchip and all its satanic progeny, the bottomless depths of public cynicism that currently afflict the political process and the absence of the Vietnam war, and it's easy to understand how those of us with longer memories - those of us who only watched the Nixon funeral to make absolutely sure he was dead - might start getting confused. </p> <p>The Exorcist - which made $165m on its original release - was wheeled out in a slightly doctored form and hoovered up a very tasty $12m, with a per-screen average that spelled packed house. The posters and the ad campaign both refer breathlessly to \"the version you've never seen\" because director William Friedkin - or perhaps Warner Bros - has finally agreed to incorporate scenes, removed from the release version, that Catholic writer William Peter Blatty insisted lent the story a more spiritual, humanising tone, but which the Jewish Friedkin felt slowed things down in dramatic terms. </p> <p>So this is not so much the director's cut as the writer's version, although Friedkin supervised the new assembly. With his own career currently in a holding pattern that suggests the perils of being married to the head of the studio (in his case, glammy Paramount chief Sherry Lansing), Friedkin has decided to back down over matters he didn't seem interested in at the time of 1998's 25th anniversary restoration. One wonders if the addition of the Blatty scenes - the best of which is a shot of Linda Blair doing a bent-spine backwards crabwalk down a flight of stairs - isn't just a matter of the studio gilding the re-released lily for all it's worth. </p> <p>I have problems with the whole notion of the \"director's cut\". Apart from its sense of a totally coherent, fully realised future environment, I never much liked Blade Runner, no matter what Ridley Scott did to improve it. The original was both clarified and muddied by Harrison Ford's lugubrious film noir voiceover. Yet the narration did clarify things and when it was removed for the reissue, parts of the movie became incoherent unless you'd already seen the original - now, as part of the resale process, downgraded to \"flawed masterpiece \", the better to convince us we were getting more bang for our now twice-spent dollar. </p> <p>Similarly with Sam Peckinpah's Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid, which was butchered by the head of MGM in an undisguised act of animosity toward the famously truculent director. The re-release also removed moments that were among the best in the original version, leading critic Paul Seydor to suggest that whatever it was, it wasn't \"Peckinpah's version\", not least because the director himself was now six feet under. </p> <p>Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid was also released in 1973, which tends to inhibit nostalgia for the studios of the period. That's not something likely to deter Cameron Crowe, whose semi-autobiographical Almost Famous recreates the summer of that year, when the 15-year-old Crowe did his first assignments for Rolling Stone magazine, which had no idea of his tender age. As with all of Crowe's movies, it's not until after you've left the movie house that you begin to realise all the emotional manipulations you've been subjected to, and how Crowe's slickness - and, I think, emotional dishonesty - have managed to trick you. </p> <p>Almost Famous is less culpable in this regard than Jerry Maguire, but thinking of 1973 and witnessing the Exorcist's renewed success, one starts wishing they'd just suspend the entire studio production schedule and re-release all the great lost movies of that period, like Monte Hellman's Cockfighter, Arthur Penn's Night Moves, Ivan Passer's Cutter's Way and Karel Reisz's Who'll Stop The Rain. And if the writers' actors' and directors' strikes all kick in over the next year and production does dry up and lead to blank screens then, God knows, we might see it happen yet.</p> <p><strong> Jan Michael Vincent: Hollywood's most indefatigable drunk</strong></p> <p>That list of celebrity party-boys who become celebrity jailbirds just keeps growing. We've had poor, blitzed Robert Downey Jr, who celebrated his recent release by taking a job on Ally McBeal. Then there was Christian Slater, who bit a cop who was trying to arrest the errant actor for drunkenly hitting his wife. Charlie Sheen is infamous for his hop-headed, bed-hopping shenanigans (his probation is administered by the same exasperated Malibu judge who jailed Downey) and ageing pretty boy Rick Springfield was recently charged with knocking his missus about. None of them however, can hold a candle to Hollywood's most indefatigable drunk, Jan Michael Vincent, whose 25-year-old battle with the hop and the grape has, perhaps inevitably, now landed the gin-blossomed former Airwolf star in chokey. </p> <p>One can see Vincent's entire decline mapped out in John Milius's Nietzschean 1978 surfer movie Big Wednesday, in which Vincent - already a major booze ghoul - played a legendary surfer who's an alcoholic before he leaves his teens. </p> <p>His incarceration stems from repeated violations of his probation on previous charges of public drunkenness and domestic violence. Having been found rolling around incoherently on a sidewalk in Santa Monica in January, Vincent was faced with six months inside; he was then arrested for pulling his long-suffering wife's hair and pushing her about, making his 60-day sentence inevitable. </p> <p>Vincent broke his neck in a drunken 1996 car wreck and then sued the paramedics who'd saved his life but damaged his vocal cords (his voice is now just a rasp). </p> <p>He'd also faced charges of kicking one girlfriend in the stomach when she was pregnant. He'll go directly from his live-in detox mansion to the Big House, where his now hideously addled looks will no doubt prove a useful deterrent to predators in the showers. </p> <p> <strong> Bankrupt Anna hits back</strong><br> </p> <p> \"This is not about a gold-digger sucking money. This is about a relationship that was very profound.\" Pardon me for smirking at these words from the attorney who is helping bankrupt Playboy centrefold Anna Nicole Smith to contest the will of her late oil billionaire husband Howard Marshall. Smith was a 26-year-old stripper when she was courted by the octogenarian. She claims she lived in wedded bliss for 14 months before his death, aged 90, in August 1995, and that he promised her half of his fortune, estimated at between $60m and $1.6bn. She got nothing. Smith is broke after losing $850,000 in a sexual harassment case brought by a former female assistant. </p> <p><strong> King's grief for van driver</strong><br> </p> <p>Stephen King expressed sadness this week about the death of the man who accidentally ran him over last year and nearly killed the writer - in a scenario that eerily resembled the opening of his novel Misery. King had been gently critical of the decision not to jail Smith or revoke his licence after the accident, but later contented himself with buying Smith's wrecked van and promptly destroying it with a sledge-hammer once he was fit. An autopsy was unable to determine the cause of death. </p> <p><strong> Sweet smell gone sour</strong><br> </p> <p>And a tiny titbit for fans of the classic 1958 Burt Lancaster-Tony Curtis movie Sweet Smell of Success, in which Lancaster plays a powerful Broadway columnist who has a semi-incestuous relationship with his sister, played by the otherwise unknown actress Susan Harrison. Harrison turns out to be the mother of Darva Conger, who helped the Fox network plumb new depths of tastelessness when she won a husband on the special Who Wants To Marry A Millionaire? She divorced him almost immediately after he was accused of beating up an ex-girlfriend. Conger then stripped for Hef, and is now said to be dating TV scandal-monger and possible NYC mayoral candidate Geraldo Rivera. Maybe John Cusack will put her in his Sweet Smell remake.</p>",

Almost Famous is less culpable in this regard than Jerry Maguire, but thinking of 1973 and witnessing the Exorcist's renewed success, one starts wishing they'd just suspend the entire studio production schedule and re-release all the great lost movies of that period, like Monte Hellman's Cockfighter, Arthur Penn's Night Moves, Ivan Passer's Cutter's Way and Karel Reisz's Who'll Stop The Rain. And if the writers' actors' and directors' strikes all kick in over the next year and production does dry up and lead to blank screens then, God knows, we might see it happen yet. Jan Michael Vincent: Hollywood's most indefatigable drunk That list of celebrity party-boys who become celebrity jailbirds just keeps growing. We've had poor, blitzed Robert Downey Jr, who celebrated his recent release by taking a job on Ally McBeal. Then there was Christian Slater, who bit a cop who was trying to arrest the errant actor for drunkenly hitting his wife. Charlie Sheen is infamous for his hop-headed, bed-hopping shenanigans (his probation is administered by the same exasperated Malibu judge who jailed Downey) and ageing pretty boy Rick Springfield was recently charged with knocking his missus about. None of them however, can hold a candle to Hollywood's most indefatigable drunk, Jan Michael Vincent, whose 25-year-old battle with the hop and the grape has, perhaps inevitably, now landed the gin-blossomed former Airwolf star in chokey. One can see Vincent's entire decline mapped out in John Milius's Nietzschean 1978 surfer movie Big Wednesday, in which Vincent - already a major booze ghoul - played a legendary surfer who's an alcoholic before he leaves his teens. His incarceration stems from repeated violations of his probation on previous charges of public drunkenness and domestic violence. Having been found rolling around incoherently on a sidewalk in Santa Monica in January, Vincent was faced with six months inside; he was then arrested for pulling his long-suffering wife's hair and pushing her about, making his 60-day sentence inevitable. Vincent broke his neck in a drunken 1996 car wreck and then sued the paramedics who'd saved his life but damaged his vocal cords (his voice is now just a rasp). He'd also faced charges of kicking one girlfriend in the stomach when she was pregnant. He'll go directly from his live-in detox mansion to the Big House, where his now hideously addled looks will no doubt prove a useful deterrent to predators in the showers. Bankrupt Anna hits back \"This is not about a gold-digger sucking money. This is about a relationship that was very profound.\" Pardon me for smirking at these words from the attorney who is helping bankrupt Playboy centrefold Anna Nicole Smith to contest the will of her late oil billionaire husband Howard Marshall. Smith was a 26-year-old stripper when she was courted by the octogenarian. She claims she lived in wedded bliss for 14 months before his death, aged 90, in August 1995, and that he promised her half of his fortune, estimated at between $60m and $1.6bn. She got nothing. Smith is broke after losing $850,000 in a sexual harassment case brought by a former female assistant. King's grief for van driver Stephen King expressed sadness this week about the death of the man who accidentally ran him over last year and nearly killed the writer - in a scenario that eerily resembled the opening of his novel Misery. King had been gently critical of the decision not to jail Smith or revoke his licence after the accident, but later contented himself with buying Smith's wrecked van and promptly destroying it with a sledge-hammer once he was fit. An autopsy was unable to determine the cause of death. Sweet smell gone sour And a tiny titbit for fans of the classic 1958 Burt Lancaster-Tony Curtis movie Sweet Smell of Success, in which Lancaster plays a powerful Broadway columnist who has a semi-incestuous relationship with his sister, played by the otherwise unknown actress Susan Harrison. Harrison turns out to be the mother of Darva Conger, who helped the Fox network plumb new depths of tastelessness when she won a husband on the special Who Wants To Marry A Millionaire? She divorced him almost immediately after he was accused of beating up an ex-girlfriend. Conger then stripped for Hef, and is now said to be dating TV scandal-monger and possible NYC mayoral candidate Geraldo Rivera. Maybe John Cusack will put her in his Sweet Smell remake.",

      "body": "<p> From somewhere on a spectrum between Kes and How Green Was My Valley, the British stage director Stephen Daldry brings us Billy Elliot, his screen debut. This is a bold, attractive and emotionally generous film about a young boy growing up in the north-east during the miners' strike of 1984-85, who discovers in himself a talent for dance. And - to the horror of his striking miner father, played by the perennially excellent Gary Lewis - this is not even the virile and masculine dance of Gene Kelly. It is ballet: mincing, prancing, flouncing tutu-wearing ballet, and young Billy (Jamie Bell) has to work on his pli\u00e9s along with all the girlies in a church hall where Dad sends him every week with his 50p sub in his hot little hand on the understanding that he is learning how to box. </p> <p>This is a film with a lot of charm, a lot of humour and a lot of heart. Daldry's direction and the screenplay by Lee Hall (who wrote the radio drama hit Spoonface Steinberg) distinguish themselves further in the discreet, intelligent way they deal with the question of Billy's nascent sexuality, avoiding vulgarity and prurience. The young male ballet dancer is not a stereotype, and yet the film certainly does not feel it necessary to reassure the audience that Billy is straight; for my money, that's part of this picture's liberal humanity. </p> <p>Billy finds himself in his embarrassing predicament when he is perpetually having the living daylights knocked out of him in the ring, unhappily wearing the seedy old boxing gloves that were once the property of his grandfather. Something in him responds to the sight of the ballet class in the opposite corner. He joins in, coming under the wing of the teacher, Mrs Wilkinson, played by Julie Walters, who in some ways is playing a version of the Michael Caine role in Educating Rita. She sees that dance, with its soaring language of the human spirit, might be Billy's ticket out of here. </p> <p>In Billy Elliot, dance is at once an expression of yearning, and a symptom of frustration; Mrs Wilkinson is described as \"unfulfilled - that's why she does dancing!\" Julie Walters could so easily have given an over-egged and gamey performance as the gutsy mentor, and it is a measure of her intelligence as a performer and Daldry's assurance as a director, that her approach is kept within bounds. There is a very good sequence where she and Billy do a dance routine that she has devised for him to I Love to Boogie by T Rex: and this scene nicely complements a later moment where Billy does his own dance of rage in the street when his Dad forbids him to dance again. </p> <p>It is a spontaneous choreography of frustration, which hovers between the world of realistic drama and the stylised world of the musical. But the action of Billy Elliot deepens as his father, at first infuriated, comes to accept his son's talent, and that some money must be found to enable him to audition for the Royal Ballet School. With a terrible clarity, it dawns on him that this means breaking the strike, and joining the cowering blacklegs who are bussed in through the picket lines every morning. </p> <p>So from questioning his ballet-loving son's masculinity, Billy's dad arrives at his own male crisis. The use of the strike is very studied: the period of Billy's first timid dance steps to his fateful audition covers the strike period almost exactly. By casting this momentous and traumatic event in British history as a backdrop to a young boy's growing pains, Daldry is, arguably, open to the charge of sentimentalising intractable political issues - and from a feminist perspective, there is not much to cheer about in the story of a boy who turns out to be much better than all the girls, and entirely monopolises his teacher's attention. </p> <p>Occasionally, the background furniture is pedantic, and a little baffling. Along with T Rex, we have a Ker-Plunk under Billy's bed and the inevitable Spacehopper - all shorthand for the 70s, rather than the 80s. But the incidental details are sketched in with flair and wit: there's a nice moment when Mrs Wilkinson's daughter Debbie is sauntering with Billy down the street and idly bangs a stick along the row of policemen's perspex riot shields, like railings. It couldn't happen in real life - but it's such a funny and surreal moment, of a piece with Daldry's amiable and buoyant direction. Billy Elliot has a freshness that makes it a pleasure to watch; it's a very emphatic success.</p>",

Much of the help given to survivors was donated privately, not by the state. Free hotel rooms, restaurant meals and clothes were available, and a soup kitchen was set up in the Byzantine church. An elderly woman roamed the hospital pressing medals of the Virgin Mary into palms. Ann Bennett, an American who lives on Paros, said that the community was devastated. \"Everyone knows someone who has died. This is the biggest disaster it has endured in living memory.\"",
