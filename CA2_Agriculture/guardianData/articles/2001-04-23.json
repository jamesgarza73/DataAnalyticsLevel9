He hit the headlines last week when the results of his personality test came through - and he got the sack.  <strong>Adrian Furnham</strong>  and  <strong>Anita Chaudhuri</strong>  on how psychometric testing became big business.</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It was, perhaps, the circumstances rather than the fact of Carl Filer's dismissal from what was shaping up to be a promising career at B&amp;Q that stung the most. One might argue that anyone who responds to a computerised personality interview by saying that you \"strongly disagree\" that you are an overachiever had it coming to them in any case, but Filer had already demonstrated himself to be a star salesman at the DIY chain's Bournemouth branch when the results of the 50-question psychometric test came through last week. His bosses were unhappy with the results and escorted him from the premises. </p> <p>He was by no means the only employee to take issue with a computerised measure of his character. Some years ago, a group of cleaners were upset to have their future employment decided on the basis of a test with multiple-choice questions including the following: \"Would you rather be a) an archbishop or b) a general?\" Another group went to court when a language-based personality test proved an excellent discriminator between first-generation immigrants, none of whom ended up with jobs, and those who were rather more practised in speaking English, who did. </p> <p>Nevertheless, personality testing is big business. A handful of major players - such as SHL, Oxford Psychological Press and the Gallup Organisation - dominate the industry, with the support of the human-resources professionals who are their heaviest users. According to which data you believe, between 10% and 40% of big British companies use personality tests to select new recruits - with a similar number employing intelligence testing. </p> <p> According to the Industrial Society, 5,000 different tests are currently being used to select more than half the managers in Britain, and even in high-technology posts, where technical knowledge is arguably rather more crucial than a sunny disposition, psychometric testing is used in 37% of recruitment. Enthusiasts argue there is plenty of predictive validity in such tests - they really do predict absenteeism, morale and productivity over time. Cynics would say it is a case of dissonance reduction - of employers wanting passionately to believe in tests for which they have parted with a large amount of money. </p> <p>The man who must bear at least some of the responsibility for all this is Sir Frances Galton who, in the 1880s persuaded over 9,000 people to be personality-tested in his \"anthropometric laboratory\" at the Science Museum in South Kensington. But the first personality test, as a beleaguered interview candidate might recognise it today, was developed by the American army in 1917. They wanted to weed out recruits who couldn't stand the stress of battle. </p> <p>Wars proved fruitful times for the testers. Faced with millions of conscripts, military chiefs yearned for a simple method to select one person for fighter-pilot training, another for the pay corps or another for the military police. Psychologists hurried to meet the demand, and two world wars later, the test as lucrative business was sweeping America. In Britain the key factor was the mass layoffs of the 1980s, and the subsequent inundation of firms with applicants. Testing seemed a cheap, reliable and sensible alternative to the expensive, time-consuming interview. </p> <p>As the practice has become more refined, the ambitions of the testers have developed from merely detecting the \"positive\" personalities to probing the \"dark side\": pathology and personality disorders. Increasingly, tests are used to try to detect high-flyers who may subsequently derail, or to stop psychopaths getting recruited. But their ambitions go further still. \"We are heading for the era of genetic screening,\" warns Carolyn Jones, of the Institute for Employment Rights, referring to the suggestion that one day interviewees could be given a mouth swab which could reveal the genetic and biological markers of personality. </p> <p>There are, of course, all sorts of problems. Critics argue that people can easily lie - though testers have developed tricks to combat this in return - or that anxiety, headaches or period pains might lead to different answers on different occasions. But the big one is the argument that the tests are invalid: they simply do not measure what they say they measure. The current state of the science suggests some variables - neuroticism and conscientiousness, for example - can be predicted with some certainty, but the jury is still out. Measuring the validity of the tests is expensive; few recruiters treat it as a priority. </p> <p>\"Personally, I think these tests are very flawed,\" says Carolyn Jones, who calls them \"just another mechanism to allow employers to filter out workers who do not fit. You do have to wonder exactly what they're looking for.\" </p> <p>Ben Williams, a psychologist who scores psychometric tests for a living, acknowledges their limitations. \"Testing can accurately predict behaviour to within certain parameters, and it can suss out whether the person giving super-flannel in an interview will actually be capable of doing the job required,\" he says. \"Problems tend to occur if a company doesn't understand what profile it needs in its employers, or standardises the profile in order to save time and money.\" He confesses to sometimes sounding harsh in his test reports. \"When we hand in our reports, employers probably believe about 75% of it, whereas the candidate's partner will believe 98% because they're more likely to already know the person's weaknesses.\" </p> <p>The test publishers, wary of controversy, point out that the tool has to be used wisely. \"We certainly wouldn't recommend running the test on someone who was already working there,\" says Jill Garrett, managing director of Gallup, of Mr Filer's case. Surely if an employee was seen to be good at their job but failed the test, the test might be at fault? \"Not necessarily,\" she says. \"But any psychometrician will be the first to admit that no test can be 100% accurate.\" </p> <p>The sacking of Carl Filer will bring the critics out of the woodwork again, rehearsing the same familiar arguments. But most people agree that ability, personality and motivation are the most important predictors of work success and failure. At the heart of the issue lies the unresolved, perhaps unresolvable question: how can you actually measure a quantity as shifting and vague as personality in the first place? </p> <p>The answer, ultimately, is that you do your homework: there are thousands of tests on the market, and only a few with enough data to give much credit to their claims of validity. Are they backed up by how people go on to perform in their jobs? This, perhaps, is the question that needs to be asked both by the selection professionals who fund the industry - and by the lawyers acting on behalf of those who don't quite fit the profile. </p> <p>\u0095 Adrian Furnham is professor of Psychology at University College London and the author of various books on personality theory and testing.</p> <p><strong>What are you like?</strong></p> <p>Excerpts adapted from a personality test currently in use by recruiters: </p> <p><strong> 1</strong> Do you have a small, but \"close knit\" circle of friends? </p> <p><strong> 2</strong> Do you prefer to take your time over a task? </p> <p><strong> 3</strong> Do you enjoy meeting new people? </p> <p><strong> 4</strong> Are you usually punctual for meetings? </p> <p><strong> 5</strong> Do you find it easy to make friends with new people? </p> <p><strong> 6</strong> Do you enjoy solving practical problems? </p> <p><strong> 7</strong> Do you like taking the lead in group discussions? </p> <p><strong> 8</strong> Do you prefer to do a routine job? </p> <p><strong> 9</strong> When upset, do you prefer to be left alone? </p> <p><strong> 10</strong> Do you like looking at intricately designed buildings? </p> <p><strong> 11</strong> Would you say you are strongly opinionated? </p> <p><strong> 12</strong> Do you tend to act impulsively on your desires at the time? </p> <p><strong> 13</strong> Are you happy with the way you look? </p> <p><strong> 14</strong> Do you normally notice things which others ignore? </p> <p><strong> 15</strong> Do you feel good about yourself? </p> <p><strong> 16</strong> Do your friends think of you as quite a dependable person? </p> <p><strong> 17</strong> Would you say that you know people from a variety of backgrounds? </p> <p><strong> 18</strong> Are you a good time-keeper? </p> <p><strong> 19</strong> Would you help a friend out even though it was inconvenient? </p> <p><strong> 20</strong> Would you prefer a quiet night in or to go to a bar with some friends? </p> <p><strong>How did you do?</strong></p> <p><strong> Sociability:</strong> questions 1, 5, 9, 17, 20. </p> <p><strong> Attention to detail:</strong> 2, 6, 8, 10, 14. </p> <p><strong> Self confidence:</strong> 3, 7, 11, 13,15. </p> <p><strong> Reliability:</strong> 4, 12, 16, 18, 19. </p> <p>If you answered yes to 3 or more questions in each section, an employer would be likely to assess you as showing the positive personality characteristic being measured.

      "trailText": "<p>The dot.com strategy of France's richest man has fallen apart but Bernard Arnault still looks likely to come out on top. By <strong>Randeep Ramesh</strong>.</p>",
      "byline": "Randeep Ramesh",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>You cannot walk directly into Bernard Arnault's personal office in the fashionable eighth arrondissement of Paris. A camera bears down on any visitor to the French billionaire's room and a bullet-proof glass door only silently withdraws once you have been inspected by his bodyguards. </p> <p>Getting in to see the owner of Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior and Givenchy once meant you probably could afford one of his company's \u00a340,000 Ebel watches or a bottle of \u00a3150 Dom Perignon champagne, another Arnault brand. </p> <p>Then France's richest man discovered the internet. Besuited executives at haute couture house LVMH, where Arnault is chief executive and largest shareholder, watched bright young things bowl into their offices attired in jeans and worn sweatshirts. \"They aren't concerned with fashion,\" Arnault told reporters. \"They wear the Gap.\" </p> <p>What these cyber-entrepreneurs were concerned with was making money fast - something the LVMH boss appreciated. He had quietly built an impressive US portfolio of net stocks - with \u00a360m invested in music site <a href=\"http://www.mp3.com\">MP3.com</a> and \u00a36m in <a href=\"http://www.ebay.com\">eBay</a>. These were minority stakes in the pre-flotation rounds of financing and, according to market watchers, were then worth \"a couple of billion dollars\". </p> <p>Emboldened by his American experience, Arnault prepared to grab a large chunk of European cyberspace. He set up an investment fund, Europ@web, with 80m euros (\u00a350m) of his own cash to put into an array of net ventures. </p> <p>The focus, initially, was Europe. A little more than 31m euros went into eLuxury, a retail site that would do for LVMH's brands what Amazon was doing for books. Arnault also owned Phillips auctioneers and considered online marketplaces a good bet. QXL and iCollector of Britain received nearly 38m euros between them, while Aucland.com in France was pumped up with 16m euros. </p> <p>Arnault was not just interested in moving his brands to the net. Europ@web squirted 80m euros into Zebank, which was to be the continent's premier online bank, and bought 35% of internet service provider LibertySurf for 54m euros. By the end of 1999 Arnault had holdings in 19 companies. </p> <p>The pope of fashion, as Arnault had been labelled, appeared intent on being the caesar of cyberspace. Europ@web sprawled over the globe. More than 17m euros went into Submarino - an online retailer in Brazil. Another 10m euros was poured into liquidation.com, a business-to-business marketplace based in Washington. </p> <p>Europ@web opened nine offices in Europe and the US, hired 100 investment professionals and administered a fund of 500m euros.

Europ@web paid 30m euros for a chunk of online auctioneer QXL in June 1999. Today the stake is worth less than 3m euros. Another online marketplace, iCollector, received 8m euros.

      "bodyText": "You cannot walk directly into Bernard Arnault's personal office in the fashionable eighth arrondissement of Paris. A camera bears down on any visitor to the French billionaire's room and a bullet-proof glass door only silently withdraws once you have been inspected by his bodyguards. Getting in to see the owner of Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior and Givenchy once meant you probably could afford one of his company's \u00a340,000 Ebel watches or a bottle of \u00a3150 Dom Perignon champagne, another Arnault brand. Then France's richest man discovered the internet. Besuited executives at haute couture house LVMH, where Arnault is chief executive and largest shareholder, watched bright young things bowl into their offices attired in jeans and worn sweatshirts. \"They aren't concerned with fashion,\" Arnault told reporters. \"They wear the Gap.\" What these cyber-entrepreneurs were concerned with was making money fast - something the LVMH boss appreciated. He had quietly built an impressive US portfolio of net stocks - with \u00a360m invested in music site MP3.com and \u00a36m in eBay. These were minority stakes in the pre-flotation rounds of financing and, according to market watchers, were then worth \"a couple of billion dollars\". Emboldened by his American experience, Arnault prepared to grab a large chunk of European cyberspace. He set up an investment fund, Europ@web, with 80m euros (\u00a350m) of his own cash to put into an array of net ventures. The focus, initially, was Europe. A little more than 31m euros went into eLuxury, a retail site that would do for LVMH's brands what Amazon was doing for books. Arnault also owned Phillips auctioneers and considered online marketplaces a good bet. QXL and iCollector of Britain received nearly 38m euros between them, while Aucland.com in France was pumped up with 16m euros. Arnault was not just interested in moving his brands to the net. Europ@web squirted 80m euros into Zebank, which was to be the continent's premier online bank, and bought 35% of internet service provider LibertySurf for 54m euros. By the end of 1999 Arnault had holdings in 19 companies. The pope of fashion, as Arnault had been labelled, appeared intent on being the caesar of cyberspace. Europ@web sprawled over the globe. More than 17m euros went into Submarino - an online retailer in Brazil. Another 10m euros was poured into liquidation.com, a business-to-business marketplace based in Washington. Europ@web opened nine offices in Europe and the US, hired 100 investment professionals and administered a fund of 500m euros. By summer 2000, Arnault's sortie into cyberspace had netted him stakes in 42 companies. Then the campaign faltered. Just as Arnault was readying to float Europ@web for 3bn euros, fashion website Boo.com burned out. More than $135m (\u00a394m) went up in flames - $12m belonging to Arnault. Worse the Nasdaq fell, at first slowly and then inexorably into freefall. \"Bernard Arnault can be extremely charming but he is ruthless,\" said one source, who refused to be named. \"He has an almost photographic memory and can recall the smallest details of bids put to him.

      "body": "<p>As a showcase of the newest music by the latest generation of composers, the London Sinfonietta's State of the Nation weekend is unique in the British music calendar. This year, the programme of world and UK premieres was as ambitious as ever: with conductors Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Valade and Garry Walker, the ensemble performed over a dozen new pieces in five concerts over two days. </p> <p>Yet for State of the Nation to be more significant than a celebration of statistics and the superhuman stamina of performers and listeners, the new works have to live up to the hype of representing the best of new classical music. The range of styles, approaches and genres was typically wide: from Peter Batchelor's three-minute tape piece based on steam engines, Steamin', to Jonathan Powell's A Rebours, an ambitious 25-minute piano concerto. Taken as a whole, the weekend presented a blend of the worthy, the well-crafted and the genuinely innovative. </p> <p>The pieces that stood out were those whose imagination broke the frame of convention. Fraser Trainer's The Colour of Scars, for soprano saxophone and 14 players, developed a vivid drama from its Mark-Anthony Turnage-inspired language. But neither of the most memorable ensemble works were world premieres. Richard Ayres's No 24: Noncerto for Alto Trombone was written in 1995; this \"uncertain concerto\" - Ayres's explanation of his title - was a moving study of musical dislocation. </p> <p>With David Purser, the soloist, battling with a bag full of mutes, from a tin can to a paper plate, and attempting to articulate a coherent musical line, the piece was poised delicately between comedy and tragedy. Ian Vine's espinas, composed in 1999 and inspired by the mobiles of Alexander Calder, suspended Roger Benedict's impassioned viola solo between static extremes of high and low registers, as if the viola were a heavy object caught in weightless limbo. </p> <p>There was another image of a viola in space in Tansy Davies's Small Black Stone for viola and piano. This taut, seven-minute movement, with its ferocious dynamism and luminous coda, expressed the compressed energy of cosmic forces.

      "bodyText": "As a showcase of the newest music by the latest generation of composers, the London Sinfonietta's State of the Nation weekend is unique in the British music calendar. This year, the programme of world and UK premieres was as ambitious as ever: with conductors Pierre-Andr\u00e9 Valade and Garry Walker, the ensemble performed over a dozen new pieces in five concerts over two days. Yet for State of the Nation to be more significant than a celebration of statistics and the superhuman stamina of performers and listeners, the new works have to live up to the hype of representing the best of new classical music. The range of styles, approaches and genres was typically wide: from Peter Batchelor's three-minute tape piece based on steam engines, Steamin', to Jonathan Powell's A Rebours, an ambitious 25-minute piano concerto. Taken as a whole, the weekend presented a blend of the worthy, the well-crafted and the genuinely innovative. The pieces that stood out were those whose imagination broke the frame of convention. Fraser Trainer's The Colour of Scars, for soprano saxophone and 14 players, developed a vivid drama from its Mark-Anthony Turnage-inspired language. But neither of the most memorable ensemble works were world premieres. Richard Ayres's No 24: Noncerto for Alto Trombone was written in 1995; this \"uncertain concerto\" - Ayres's explanation of his title - was a moving study of musical dislocation. With David Purser, the soloist, battling with a bag full of mutes, from a tin can to a paper plate, and attempting to articulate a coherent musical line, the piece was poised delicately between comedy and tragedy. Ian Vine's espinas, composed in 1999 and inspired by the mobiles of Alexander Calder, suspended Roger Benedict's impassioned viola solo between static extremes of high and low registers, as if the viola were a heavy object caught in weightless limbo. There was another image of a viola in space in Tansy Davies's Small Black Stone for viola and piano. This taut, seven-minute movement, with its ferocious dynamism and luminous coda, expressed the compressed energy of cosmic forces. Rolf Hind's Cloud Shadow/Solgata for piano, played by the composer, was a similarly elemental investigation of light and reflection. Where Cloud Shadow was a scintillating rhythmic ripple at either end of the piano's range, Solgata focused on the half-light of piano strings muffled by Blu-Tack. With another ingenious device, Hind conjured sustained notes from the piano, creating a shimmering texture. But the real heroes of the weekend were the players of the Sinfonietta and especially Valade, who conducted the bulk of the concerts with understated brilliance. With videos of each composer discussing their works cleverly masking the breaks between pieces, State of the Nation was as successful in its presentation as it was impressive in conception.",

A genial and thoughtful man, he bears none of the scars of a week in the eye of a tabloid storm, and seems happy and incredulous: \"It's all very strange.\" At least for now, he's back teaching physics at Denstone College (the kids now say \"Give us a tenner, sir\"). He and Vivian, also a teacher, have two college-age children: \"I don't think anybody who knows us will see any ostentatious change in the way we live,\" he says. </p> <p>Edwards is no ordinary Who Wants to be a Millionaire? contestant - he's a previous winner of Mastermind and one-time Mensa Superbrain who meticulously plotted his Millionaire win for a specific purpose. \"This was pretty cold-blooded,\" he says. \"I wanted to win a lot of money, ideally enough to retire on.\" To ensure the success of his scheme, Edwards calculated the number of phone calls he'd need to make to gain a place on the show, then set aside \u00a31,000 to cover the cost. He also rehearsed the coordination required for the programme's Fastest Finger round, at which he'd been beaten on an earlier appearance. This obsessive behaviour having reaped rewards, however, Edwards maintained an admirable self-irony throughout his winning performance. He now insists: \"If I had gone away - again - with just a travel expenses cheque, it would still have been an enjoyable experience.\" </p> <p>This is a man, after all, who is quiz mad. His Mensa title was awarded, in 1985, after he won a newspaper competition. \"Until then,\" he explains, \"I hadn't realised there was anything about my general knowledge that was more than just better than average.\" So what does he put that knowledge down to? \"I can remember, when I was about seven, my mum buying me a little Manila-covered booklet for ninepence in Woolworths which contained lists of facts. I went through it and memorised all the capital cities, everything.\" </p> <p>He grew up in Barry in south Wales in the 60s: \"Education was considered very important. It was a way out of the automatic progression to the mines.\" But his secret isn't just in 60s schooling. \"Television was much more informative then. I accumulated a lot of knowledge, probably mostly useless, from watching television.\" </p> <p>As teacher and quiz show veteran, Edwards is perfectly positioned to see how things have changed over 30 years in both areas. On TV, as in schools, the concept of public service has had to defer to the market. Out with Ask the Family, in with Who Wants to be a Millionaire. \"Since the 80s,\" Edwards agrees, \"money has become more important, as has the feeling of every man for himself.\" </p> <p>So is Edwards at ease with the signals that Who Wants to be a Millionaire sends out? \"I think sometimes money is seen to be the be-all and end-all,\" he says, circumspectly. \"I'm not in a very strong position to be saying this, because I've deliberately gone into a competition with the intention of winning as much money as I could. But it is a shame that sometimes the pursuit of money is seen as more important than the achievement of coming through a rigorous competition.\" He pauses, for a long time. \"If I think too hard about this, I feel in danger of being hypocritical.\" </p> <p>Are the standards against which he is measuring himself sustainable in an age when Edwards is paid about three times as much for 30 minutes as he has been paid in 30 years teaching? There is, he adds, \"Something that's not quite right there.

He enjoys teaching enough to continue for a while, and is looking forward to the time when some pupil brushes him up the wrong way and he can say, \"I don't care, I'm a millionaire\". </p> <p>\"The money will buy freedom to do all the things I'm interested in and don't have time to do properly, and wouldn't expect to have time to do until I retire, when I may not be fit enough to make the most of it. Now I can retire fairly soon, and carry on playing squash, and sword-dancing - that's traditional Northumbrian sword-dancing - and getting better at the concertina, and following up my family history research,\" says Edwards. </p> <p>He'll have more time, too, to spend on pub quizzes - another hobby - while he prepares an assault on his next target - BBC Radio's Brain of Britain.</p>",

The company's negotiations to sell Stream, the Italian pay-TV concern, might allow it to increase its terms marginally. Neither GM nor News Corp would comment on the state of play or even confirm that the talks taking place yesterday. Mr Murdoch was understood to have instigated the meeting through a letter to the GM board but the car group's executives called the meeting, alongside that with the internal team. In meetings with analysts earlier this month, Hughes executives said they had been given several week by the GM boards to come up with an alternative plan. The decision over whether to go ahead with Mr Murdoch's plan could come as early as next week's scheduled board meeting.",

They also thought nearly half of all disabled people used wheelchairs, when in reality the figure is 5%, and didn't know that diseases such as HIV and heart disease were included in the act.",

      "body": "<p>How would you like to watch someone die? And this isn't just anyone. This is the infamous Timothy McVeigh, the man who blew up the federal building in Oklahoma in 1995, murdering 168 men, women and children with a home-made fertiliser-bomb. </p> <p>The offer comes from the Florida web-hosting company Entertainment Network, which wants to place a webcam in the execution chamber to film McVeigh's death by lethal injection next month at his Indiana jail. The company would charge users $1.95 (\u00a31.35) for the show, a proposal promptly turned down by the US government: \"The constitution does not require that those who wish to record courts or executions be allowed to do so,\" the assistant US attorney, Gerald Coraz, said. \"Executions should not be public spectacles.\" District court judge John Tinder agreed, refusing the request on Friday. Entertainment network has vowed to appeal. </p> <p>It sounds like the classic internet horror story, with the webcast as a moral-free zone serving up horror for titillation (and dollars). Cue earnest debates about the evil in our midst. </p> <p>But whether or not it goes ahead, the webcast actually has a cold logic to it. It's a position stated by Entertainment Network's chief executive, David Marshlack: \"The government is sponsoring the killing of the human being who was responsible for this horrendous act, and we believe the people have an absolute right to witness this action.\" And it cites a poll (on the Entertainment Network site, naturally) that shows 61% in favour of broadcast. </p> <p>On one level, why not? Executions are legal in the US, and the death penalty is widely supported. Shouldn't Americans know what goes on in their name, in the name of law and order? These are deep questions: what happens when someone receives a lethal injection? Is it painless? How are they treated beforehand? What are their last words? Has the reality of dying struck home? The reality is, by all accounts, messy, inconclusive and possibly mundane. But surely it has a place in a national - and international - debate. </p> <p>As for McVeigh himself, he has waived all his rights of appeal and will almost certainly die in May - in a procedure he has said he wants shown live on the web, call ing it \"state-assisted suicide\". Entertainment Network says the money would be donated to charities for the 168 people killed in the bombing - although families of the victims say they want no part in it. </p> <p>The event itself promises to be a media merry-go-round. More than 1,400 reporters will be covering McVeigh's death - 10 of whose news organisations will fork out the $1,146.50 fee for the closest possible view (plus transport by golf carts around the prison complex, padded chairs, phone lines and \"chilled bottled water\"). And there will be a broadcast of sorts anyway: this month, the US attorney general, John Ashcroft, agreed to allow McVeigh's execution to be shown on closed-circuit television to families of his victims in Oklahoma. </p> <p>The webcast undoubtedly is voyeurism of a sort. Entertainment Network is hardly CNN - the company operates VoyeurDorm.com, a website on which 55 cameras are trained on female students, and DudeDorm.com, which features the same treatment for 14 gay and straight male college students. But there are other questions. Isn't all news voyeurism? While journalists get to witness events and report back, the web offers readers the opportunity to bypass editors and go straight to the source. </p> <p> A nd this was always the promise of the net. It was going to provide unlimited and unrivalled access to information. In secretive countries such as Britain, hidden papers would be revealed and governments would fear their impact on the waiting world. In the US, where freedom of information is a constitutional right, it would provide global access to the huge amount of data available. Of course, court action may be irrelevant anyway - things have a habit of leaking on to the web and this video may too. </p> <p>However, the net does not entitle anyone to unlimited access to anything they want - child pornography, for instance. But the fact that it exists is not the fault of the internet, just as the case of the two \"internet babies\" (adopted using a company with a website) that turned into an international incident wasn't the fault of the net. </p> <p>That this has become an issue at all says a lot more about the nature of the execution debate than it does about what is essentially just a communications medium. Can you support the death penalty but want it to be hidden away? The other interesting feature of this case is that while state executions are common, this will be the first federal execution since the US supreme court reinstated the death penalty in 1963. The state is taking McVeigh's life - and whether you agree with it or not, that is surely significant. </p> <p>Maybe the problem is with the death penalty itself, rather than the net.</p>",

The company would charge users $1.95 (\u00a31.35) for the show, a proposal promptly turned down by the US government: \"The constitution does not require that those who wish to record courts or executions be allowed to do so,\" the assistant US attorney, Gerald Coraz, said. \"Executions should not be public spectacles.\" District court judge John Tinder agreed, refusing the request on Friday. Entertainment network has vowed to appeal. It sounds like the classic internet horror story, with the webcast as a moral-free zone serving up horror for titillation (and dollars). Cue earnest debates about the evil in our midst. But whether or not it goes ahead, the webcast actually has a cold logic to it. It's a position stated by Entertainment Network's chief executive, David Marshlack: \"The government is sponsoring the killing of the human being who was responsible for this horrendous act, and we believe the people have an absolute right to witness this action.\" And it cites a poll (on the Entertainment Network site, naturally) that shows 61% in favour of broadcast. On one level, why not? Executions are legal in the US, and the death penalty is widely supported. Shouldn't Americans know what goes on in their name, in the name of law and order? These are deep questions: what happens when someone receives a lethal injection? Is it painless? How are they treated beforehand? What are their last words? Has the reality of dying struck home? The reality is, by all accounts, messy, inconclusive and possibly mundane. But surely it has a place in a national - and international - debate. As for McVeigh himself, he has waived all his rights of appeal and will almost certainly die in May - in a procedure he has said he wants shown live on the web, call ing it \"state-assisted suicide\". Entertainment Network says the money would be donated to charities for the 168 people killed in the bombing - although families of the victims say they want no part in it. The event itself promises to be a media merry-go-round. More than 1,400 reporters will be covering McVeigh's death - 10 of whose news organisations will fork out the $1,146.50 fee for the closest possible view (plus transport by golf carts around the prison complex, padded chairs, phone lines and \"chilled bottled water\"). And there will be a broadcast of sorts anyway: this month, the US attorney general, John Ashcroft, agreed to allow McVeigh's execution to be shown on closed-circuit television to families of his victims in Oklahoma. The webcast undoubtedly is voyeurism of a sort. Entertainment Network is hardly CNN - the company operates VoyeurDorm.com, a website on which 55 cameras are trained on female students, and DudeDorm.com, which features the same treatment for 14 gay and straight male college students. But there are other questions. Isn't all news voyeurism? While journalists get to witness events and report back, the web offers readers the opportunity to bypass editors and go straight to the source. A nd this was always the promise of the net. It was going to provide unlimited and unrivalled access to information. In secretive countries such as Britain, hidden papers would be revealed and governments would fear their impact on the waiting world. In the US, where freedom of information is a constitutional right, it would provide global access to the huge amount of data available. Of course, court action may be irrelevant anyway - things have a habit of leaking on to the web and this video may too. However, the net does not entitle anyone to unlimited access to anything they want - child pornography, for instance. But the fact that it exists is not the fault of the internet, just as the case of the two \"internet babies\" (adopted using a company with a website) that turned into an international incident wasn't the fault of the net. That this has become an issue at all says a lot more about the nature of the execution debate than it does about what is essentially just a communications medium. Can you support the death penalty but want it to be hidden away? The other interesting feature of this case is that while state executions are common, this will be the first federal execution since the US supreme court reinstated the death penalty in 1963. The state is taking McVeigh's life - and whether you agree with it or not, that is surely significant. Maybe the problem is with the death penalty itself, rather than the net.",

Last week, it warned it is to ballot its GP members on whether they are prepared to \"resign from the national health service\" next year if a new contract is not agreed - supposedly because the existing terms have foisted \"intolerable workloads\" upon GPs. It issued guidance to its family doctor members advising them how to \"curtail their workload\". This effectively tells GPs how to work to rule and includes measures such as refusing to register new patients and limiting list sizes. Industrial-style sabre-rattling can be heard elsewhere. In the north-east, 70% of GPs, according to a BMA survey, say they are willing to take \"some form of concerted action\" to protest against heavy workloads, lack of resources and too much bureaucracy. On May 1 \"hundreds\" of GPs around the country are said to be ready to participate in unofficial actions - \"wildcat\" strikes if you like - to mark National Doctor Day, a stunt organised by Doctor magazine, a weekly trade journal. These include a series of measures including attending marches in London, shutting down surgeries, just doing paperwork and not seeing patients, or, bizarrely, just seeing patients and refusing to do paperwork. So why is it so difficult to sympathise with the GPs? Is it the BMA's outrageous insistence that its highly partial interests are synonymous with those of patients? (Less work for GPs, the BMA says, is \"in the best interests of patients' health and safety.\" Much has been made of the decline in respect for GPs as a result of the Harold Shipman murders, but trust has probably been battered much more by the antiquated, patient-unfriendly opening hours held by most GPs, and the difficulty of getting out-of-hours service. Ironically, on National Doctor Day many patients would not be able to see a GP anyway, either because there were no slots available as they had not booked a fortnight previously, or because the surgery is only open when they are at work. Such sustained whingeing from one of the most secure, respected, well-paid and protected professions is guaranteed to stick in the throat. Working life is undoubtedly tough for GPs, but so is it for teachers and nurses, who earn a fraction of the salary. The average GP earns \u00a355,000, according to the BMA, although others put the average at nearer \u00a370,000. Some GPs on paid-by-results personal medical services contracts earn more than \u00a3100,000, and even up to \u00a3140,000. Their holiday entitlement is generous - a survey by GP magazine last year found that 70% of GPs get six weeks holiday a year; 14% get seven weeks off and 5% take off eight weeks or more. Nearly half of GPs go on holiday at least three times a year. The incessant complaining of the BMA brings to mind the former Tory health secretary Kenneth Clarke's infamous line: \"I do wish the more suspicious of our GPs would stop feeling nervously for their wallets every time I mention the word 'reform'.\" Mr Clarke also called the association \"a very powerful Imperial Guard type organisation\" and \"one of the nastiest (trade unions) I had dealt with\". That might be overstating it a little, but helps remind us that when the BMA defends the NHS is it also defending a very lucrative contractual arrangement for GPs, and when it speaks up for patients, it does so only to defend the interests of the BMA.",

The EU's foreign policy chief, Javier Solana, said the EU fully supports a democratic Montenegro within a democratic Yugoslavia. \"The EU opposes any unilateral steps which could run contrary to the stability of the region,\" he said. With most votes counted in Sunday's election, secessionists led by Montenegrin president Milo Djukanovic had 42% of the vote, compared to 40.6% for the party wanting their republic to remain with Serbia in the Yugoslav federation. The narrow victory margin was a signal for Mr Djukanovic not to act hastily to break up the federation, said Sweden, which currently holds the EU presidency. \"The election results in Montenegro give no clear mandate for continuing with a referendum on independence,\" said Sweden's foreign minister, Anna Lindh. \"Montenegrin society is obviously divided on the issue of Montenegro's future status.\" Meanwhile, the European commission today warned that any attempt by Montenegro to break away without negotiations with the Serbs could jeopardise continued EU aid payments. \"If the constructive dialogue is continued... then political, economic and financial aid will be continued,\" commission spokesman Gunnar Wiegand said. \"It is essential that there be stability in the region.\" Elections have left Montenegro's main pro and anti-independence movements in a virtual stalemate, dampening government hopes of broad backing for a peaceful split from Yugoslavia. Spokesman Miodrag Vukovic said Mr Djukanovic plans to form a new governing coalition with the separatist-minded Liberal party, which won 9% of the vote, and that together they would push for a referendum on independence as early as June. But pro-Yugoslavia voters have said they would boycott any referendum - which would probably doom it from the start, judging from Sunday's election results. Even before the election, the United States and its European allies were opposed to Montenegrin independence, viewing it as a potential source of new instability in the Balkans.

The Poetry Society has a programme of school visitors, but they need more financial help. It doesn't actually cost very much to send a poet into a school. Simon Armitage, Hugo Williams, Carol Anne Duffy and myself are already involved. The visits should be on a regular and unremarkable basis - it's a very practical intervention. Poetry should come along with the school milk each morning - if the school milk still came, of course. Link Poetry Class Compiled by Ros Taylor",

      "body": "<p>Go on, say it. Sebastian Faulks. Close your eyes, say it again, nice and slow. Sebastian Faulks. You get a picture in your head, right? Very English, very blond, broad shoulders, public school posh, effortlessly confident, cracking sportsman, all-round decent cove, Brideshead Revisited. At first glance, Sebastian Faulks, pronounced folks, couldn't be more Sebastian Faulks-ish. </p> <p>The author is standing outside the club he was so keen to meet at, mobile phone in one hand, big cheery wave in another. Everything is going to plan, as you'd expect. Only one problem, he says with an apologetic shuffle: the club is shut. Never crossed his mind that it might not be open for lunch. Sorry. Perhaps we should go for a drink. So we set off for a bar, and we walk and walk and walk, and when he sees I'm tiring he hails a cab. Ah, this is it, here at last, he says happily. He walks in and walks out again, bemused. \"It's changed. Used to have an upstairs. This place doesn't have an upstairs.\" Eventually, he realises his bar is next door. Beneath the urbane facade, there's something nicely shambolic about Faulks. </p> <p>He sits down with a Bloody Mary, and tells me how much he hates conflict; will do anything to avoid it. \"I never find losing your temper helps. If you lose your temper you risk losing faith, because you become incoherent and slobber,\" he says, like a man who knows his Kipling. </p> <p>Faulks's novels, of course, are all about conflict. Conflict of the heart, and conflict of the battlefield. He is best known for his first-world-war trilogy: The Girl at the Lion D'Or, Birdsong and Charlotte Gray. The last two sold phenomenally. Birdsong, with its magnificent evocation of the hellishness of the great war - all those men trapped in tunnels and trenches, maimed, maddened and ultimately destroyed by a war with no purpose - is regarded as his best book. </p> <p>But the books are about more than war. For many readers they are primarily love stories. Man eyes woman, woman eyes man, and we know that despite the fact that one is married, it will all end in a corset-ripping, faint-inducing, conscience-searching affair. </p> <p>The jacket of his new book heralds On Green Dolphin Street as a \"departure for Faulks\". And in a way, it is. The setting is more modern - America in the wake of McCarthyism and on the eve of Kennedy's election. But in the end Faulks gives us more of the same. On page five, married Mary meets Frank, and we anticipate. By page 90, \"his face was buried in her breasts\", and his tongue was \"searching for a withheld core of her\". (In 1998, Faulks won the Bad Sex Award for Charlotte Gray.) Even more familiar is the fact that this is a love triangle in which all three sides have been broken by war. </p> <p>Why is Faulks fixated on war? He says he is not - well, no more than many men of his age and upbringing. \"It's just what the 20th century did. I'm just a reporter. That's the simple answer,\" he says rather modestly, rather grandly. </p> <p>He takes me back to 1959, when six-year-old Sebastian was taught by a man \"who had an arm tucked in here, and a gammy leg, and he'd been ripped apart by bullets\". Wherever he looked there were men scarred by war. \"And my father was wounded three times,\" he says, vaguely. His dad, a trainee lawyer, joined the army as an officer, like so many university boys did. It is only when I ask that he gives more details. \"Yes, once in the head and twice in the arm.\" How badly was he shot? \"Well, it went through the tin helmet and it went through the skull, but there was no damage to the brain. When they took his helmet off the last words he remembers hearing were the sergeant's: 'The major's a goner.'\" Faulks says he thinks the war made his father relaxed, unambitious - having survived the horror, he was content with family and friends, peace and a nice garden. His idea of \"unambitious\" is interesting; his father was a judge. </p> <p>His dad didn't talk to him about his war. Was that because he wanted to protect him? \"No,\" he says. \"I think the idea was that if you talked about what you'd done, you risked your friends thinking you were shooting a line, showing off. The only people who really talked about what they'd done were people who ran pubs and hadn't been anywhere near a bullet.\" The attitude seems to have been passed down from father to son. Faulks sounds so fogeyish at times. </p> <p>He tells a story about his young, rebellious days at school. Wellington College in Berkshire was founded as a charitable foundation for sons of army officers who had been killed in action. By the time he joined as a boarder, it was a public school. Faulks couldn't stand it. \"The ethos was cold showers, cross-country runs and not standing out from the crowd. The more you blended in with the rest of the unit, the better the man you were.\" He often talks in army jargon. \"The idea was that the child came to you and badly needed to be disciplined and reshaped and corrected.\" He ran away, but only got as far as home and then returned. After O levels, he took on the authoritarian regime like never before. \"I went down with two friends of mine to demand more drugs and more women and more freedom. I think I would have been expelled, but they thought I'd get into Oxford or Cambridge and that would be good for them.\" They suggested he live in the local village with a retired teacher. Faulks not only agreed but ended up staying on at school a year longer than he had to to do even more A levels. Poor, hopeless rebel. </p> <p>He says he couldn't understand his parents. They loved him, yet they felt duty-bound to send him away for all those years. They were such a funny lot, he says - so stifled, wooden, emotionally repressed. \"My parents' generation didn't have any understanding of psychology or emotion or individual temperament. In fact, they were slightly embarrassed by all those words.\" Thankfully, he says, he is very different. \" I don't find it at all difficult to talk about sex, love, emotion. You know, girly things.\" </p> <p>I ask him what kind of schools his children go to. \"They go to very old-fashioned ... quite old-fashioned ... they'd hate me to say that, can I correct that, forward-looking independent day schools. They make friends, they play football, they have a good time.\" </p> <p>So different from his own childhood. Faulks says he was a strange, friendless little boy. \"I didn't really want to play with other kids. I made my first friend when I was 11. Unfortunately, he was Indian and he had to bugger off to India. Bastard! Then, when I was about 15, I suddenly cracked the friendship thing and became rather manically social.\" He says his 20s were a blur of parties and people. </p> <p>You seem so different from your male characters, I say. Charlie, Mary's husband in On Green Dolphin Street, is a typical Faulks man - a hard-drinking loner mired in existential despair. He gives me a funny look and orders a glass of wine. \"There's a lot of me in Charlie,\" he says. \"That fear of boredom, that fear of emptiness, that fear that it's just completely pointless. I have a tremendous battle with melancholy and depression.\" Does he take pills? \"I've had pills, yes, but everyone's had pills, haven't they? But I have learned how to deal with it.\" He remembers his stiff upper lip, decides he has overplayed it. \"Yes, it's mild depression, I suppose.\" </p> <p>Faulks often seems to be at war with himself: the radical free spirit stifled by his conservatism; the hedonist and the ascetic; the artist and businessman. You can also see it in the novels. He has a very obvious masculine side to his writing (war, technology, DIY) and a very obvious feminine side (love, landscape, romance). They don't merge, they exist side by side. </p> <p>I ask him whether he considers himself a romantic. \"Yes, I suppose so, by my definition of it.\" What is his definition? \"A romantic is someone who believes that something is valuable even if it doesn't last. And a non-romantic is someone who says that if something doesn't endure, or can't be logically proved and pinned down, it's worthless,\" he says rather stiffly. </p> <p>Does he consider himself a romantic novelist? Faulks recoils. \"No. That's a sort of, oh no, to me that says Barbara Cartland or something.\" But they are love stories? \"Yep. Among other things, they are, yep. There is always a love story in there. There is always romantic or sexual love. Both actually. Romantic stroke sexual. Plus a life affected by the public world.\" </p> <p>I tell him that's why I think he's a marketing man's dream - the middle-class chatterati, who wouldn't normally touch romantic bonkbusters, love Faulks because they can tell their friends they are reading profound books about the trenches or Kennedy. \"I hadn't thought of that, but I can see that. I can see that. I can see that. I can see that. If that were true it would be fine by me.\" </p> <p>He agrees that he has a niche market, and says that, without wishing to sound immodest, he can't think of anyone else who writes quite like he does. \"I'm very surprised that they don't, because it seems to me that what makes my novels different, perhaps, is that I'm interested equally in men and women characters and that I'm very interested in the way the public world impacts on private lives. But in a way you'd think both of those would be a given to any novelist. They seem to me so absolutely elementary, but nobody else seems to do it. I suppose Captain Corelli's Mandolin is the book I've most liked and has those elements.\" </p> <p>After university, Faulks went into journalism - he was a features writer for the Telegraph, literary editor at the Independent, a columnist for the Guardian, and deputy editor at the Independent on Sunday. Today he lives in London with his wife Veronica, who was his secretary at the Independent, and their three children. He was widely liked in journalism, though some regarded him as a dilettante. His time at the newly born Independent on Sunday was a nightmare. \"It was very tense. We'd taken people away from steady jobs and they had one baby and a huge mortgage.\" He couldn't stand making people redundant. Despite the apparent insouciance, the stress gave him an ulcer. </p> <p>Does he recognise himself when he is profiled? \"No, not really. It's a sort of alter ego. But I've come to recognise it. The alter ego comes across as very large, lumbering, burly, languid, slightly posh, slow, gentlemanly, a rather old-fashioned sort of creature. Whereas inside I feel very nervy and nervous and quick and impatient.\" Most of his friends would recognise both sides. </p> <p>Perhaps this inner battle is best seen in his attitude to war itself. In the books, the vileness of it all wins out; in life the romance does. He seems to have little respect for his journalistic days because it was second-hand experience. He feels that life has been too easy and, as a result, too empty. As a child, did he want to fight a war? \"No, though I assumed that I would. They just seemed to come every 30 years, and I was ready for it.\" </p> <p>Does he feel he has missed out by not fighting a war? \"Not really, no. Of course, there is that intensity of experience for which I am hungry.\" What would the intensity be like? \"I think closeness to death would be pretty exhilarating, in a way, and friendship, yeh, and selflessness, a kind of selflessness, a sense of your own worthlessness, I think, is pretty exhilarating.\" Isn't the sense of selflessness a bit Boy's Own? \"I think selflessness is the wrong word. I think expendability. The feeling that you are just an atom in a very large mass. Pretty depressing in a way. I think it would also be oddly thrilling.\" </p> <p>A couple of hours and a few glasses of wine later, Faulks returns to the word exhilarated. He has just said that his wife and children make him happier than anything, and mentioned a time he hugged his oldest son after a bath. \"I was consumed by happiness. There was nothing I could imagine that could be more ecstatic than that moment.\" He stops, stares into the emptied glass. \"But apart from that you don't get so excited when you're older, you just don't get that turned on, you don't get exhilarated in the same way. In my 20s you could have skiing, or football, or dancing, or partying, you know. Feel absolutely on fire. And I haven't felt on fire for years.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p>This month on Everest's bleak north face, an American expedition will be searching for the dessicated remains of Andrew Irvine, the 22-year-old Oxford student who disappeared in 1924 with George Mallory - whose marble-like broken form was discovered in 1999. </p> <p>The romantic story of these explorers dressed in their tweeds and puttees is not just about whether they reached the summit before they perished, 29 years before Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay climbed the mountain. It has become a myth from an age of innocence, before modernity's consumerism and egocentricity overwhelmed Everest in an avalanche of sponsors' badges and empty oxygen bottles. </p> <p>But while the Americans hope to bask in the reflected glory of Irvine's courage, there is a more direct link to this era. Because while all the sahibs who watched Mallory and Irvine disappear forever in the spring of 1924 are long since dead, one of the Sherpas who climbed with them is still alive, now aged 97, and living in the Indian hill station of Darjeeling, under the huge massif of Kangchenjunga. </p> <p>Ang Tsering was born in Nepal in 1904 in the remote village of Thame close to the border with Tibet. One of five brothers, he tended the family yak herd, but left the Everest region in October 1920, looking for work in Darjeeling. Through a combination of chance and courage, he ended up being one of the best-known Sherpas of the pre-war period, going to Everest with the British in 1924 and 1933 and to the huge peak of Nanga Parbat, now in Pakistan, with a German team in 1934. As he turns the pages of his photo album, revealing team photographs from the 1920s and 1930s, his hand brushes each page and he utters one word in Nepali: \"Chaina.\" They are gone. </p> <p>How the old Sherpa came to be in Darjeeling is mixed up in the economic and political revolution that the British brought to the Himalayan foothills of northern West Bengal and Sikkim.

The Sherpas couldn't do the paperwork and the Himalayan Club looked after that.\" The Himalayan Club, based in Darjeeling, became an employment agency for expeditions, regulating working conditions for Sherpas like Ang Tsering. Their secretaries became closely involved with the Sherpa community, perhaps the most famous being Jill Henderson after the war. \"Mrs Henderson was a very good lady.

      "bodyText": "This month on Everest's bleak north face, an American expedition will be searching for the dessicated remains of Andrew Irvine, the 22-year-old Oxford student who disappeared in 1924 with George Mallory - whose marble-like broken form was discovered in 1999. The romantic story of these explorers dressed in their tweeds and puttees is not just about whether they reached the summit before they perished, 29 years before Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay climbed the mountain. It has become a myth from an age of innocence, before modernity's consumerism and egocentricity overwhelmed Everest in an avalanche of sponsors' badges and empty oxygen bottles. But while the Americans hope to bask in the reflected glory of Irvine's courage, there is a more direct link to this era. Because while all the sahibs who watched Mallory and Irvine disappear forever in the spring of 1924 are long since dead, one of the Sherpas who climbed with them is still alive, now aged 97, and living in the Indian hill station of Darjeeling, under the huge massif of Kangchenjunga. Ang Tsering was born in Nepal in 1904 in the remote village of Thame close to the border with Tibet. One of five brothers, he tended the family yak herd, but left the Everest region in October 1920, looking for work in Darjeeling. Through a combination of chance and courage, he ended up being one of the best-known Sherpas of the pre-war period, going to Everest with the British in 1924 and 1933 and to the huge peak of Nanga Parbat, now in Pakistan, with a German team in 1934. As he turns the pages of his photo album, revealing team photographs from the 1920s and 1930s, his hand brushes each page and he utters one word in Nepali: \"Chaina.\" They are gone. How the old Sherpa came to be in Darjeeling is mixed up in the economic and political revolution that the British brought to the Himalayan foothills of northern West Bengal and Sikkim. Where before there was no one and nothing but forest, the British made tea plantations and offered work to thousands of migrant workers from the Himalayan region. There were Rais, Limbus, Bhutanese, Lepchas, full-blown Tibetans and their cousins from the Khumbu region of Nepal in the shadow of Everest itself - the Sherpas. When the British first started mountaineering in the Himalayas they cast around for the best porters to carry supplies in the thin air and extreme cold of high altitude. The Tibetans had the genetic advantage of having lived for generations at altitude, but they were high-spirited and unruly. The Gurungs, who had earned fame in the Gurkha regiments of the Indian Army, were willing and cheerful but couldn't climb at high altitude.

      "body": "<p>One of the most interestingly controversial musical figures of his generation, the Italian conductor and composer Giuseppe Sinopoli has died, aged 54, of a heart attack while conducting a Berlin performance of Verdi's Aida - the work with which he made his operatic debut in his native Venice in 1978.</p> <p>The symmetry might suggest a straight career trajectory for a man destined to conduct the great operas and symphonies of the Italian and German repertoires. In fact, the development of the young Sinopoli was altogether more interesting, and makes more sense of the studied, analytic light in which he revealed - or, for some listeners, destroyed - familiar masterpieces. Until 1981, Sinopoli's reputation might have stood as a composer, following, to a certain extent, the examples of his fellow Venetian Bruno Maderna and the Veronese Franco Donatoni. Like Maderna, he studied for a while at Venice's Benedetto Marcello Conservatoire, but found greater fulfilment when he followed the senior composer to the more challenging musical environment of Darmstadt.</p> <p>Parallel to this rigorous schooling, he followed the wishes of his Sicilian father and worked for a doctor's degree in medicine as a surgeon and psychiatrist at the University of Padua. In 1972, both of his disciplines came to fruition: he was appointed professor of contemporary and electronic music at the Venice Conservatoire, graduating meanwhile in Padua with a doctoral dissertation on criminal anthropology and, in the psychiatric field, a study on the physiology of the acoustic mental area. He also took his first steps in conducting with Hans Swarowsky in Vienna, founding Venice's Bruno Maderna Ensemble three years later; his first major recording, in 1981, was of Maderna's music, though few such daring choices of repertoire ensued.</p> <p>His compositions, like his later conducting, combined structural rigour with sensuous textures. Yet few of them have been heard in this country; and after the 1981 Munich premiere of his opera Lou Salome, taking as its protagonist the far-from-bluestocking colleague and muse of Nietzsche and Freud, composing took a back seat to conducting.</p> <p>The 1980s was the decade in which Sinopoli the conductor came to power. His operatic supremacy was confirmed in 1985 with performances of Puccini's Tosca at the Metropolitan Opera, New York, and Wagner's Tannhauser at the festival shrine of Bayreuth, where he was due to return to conduct the Ring cycle this summer. He injected new life into Rome's Accademia di Santa Cecilia Orchestra during a four-year tenure. He also began his love-hate relationship with the British public and critics, conducting Puccini's Manon Lescaut at the Royal Opera House, before taking up his post as principal conductor of the Philharmonia - with, as he admitted, little experience of large-scale symphonic concerts - in 1984. It is easy to see where the critical hostility came from: Sinopoli's preference for slow speeds and mannered, sometimes lifeless phrasing, brought back a juggernaut approach to Brahms and Schumann at a time when authentic liveliness was the order of the day, and could result in some leaden evenings in the concert hall.</p> <p>Yet there was always the phenomenal ear for layering of textures, however eccentric - the brass perspectives in his Bruckner interpretations were impressive, and recognisably Sinopolian, whatever the doubts about the pacing of the perfor mance - and the capacity to surprise. The Mahler symphonies which he performed with the orchestra and subsequently recorded for his loyal company, Deutsche Grammophon, flashed only occasional theatrical fire until an astonishing interpretation of the maverick Seventh, the hardest of the series to balance and articulate. Taking place in the Royal Festival Hall within days of a performance by the reigning Mahler conductor, Klaus Tennstedt, it bore the results of endless preparation; though in the cold light of the recording, the usual eccentricities of tempo and emphasis can easily pall.</p> <p>The players, of course, remained baffled by Sinopoli's peculiarly Italian brand of intellectualism; London musicians never like too much talk, let alone an analytic seminar on the work in question. The Philharmonia relationship, buckling under the weight of the critical opprobrium, nearly came to an end in early 1990; but Sinopoli stayed on in his ennobled capacity as music director until 1994. There was too much at stake - the ever-fruitful contract with Deutsche Grammophon and tours to countries such as Japan and Germany, which idolised the maestro as Britain never did. The Italian opera recordings, to which the Philharmonia lent an unprecedented degree of tonal beauty, were generally better received than Sinopoli's symphonic repertoire. Here, too, there were sometimes justified charges of excessive mannerism; and the conductor's habit of laying everything on the dissecting table resulted in conspicuous recording edits, sometimes in the middle of a singer's phrase or note. Yet Sinopoli's surprising affinity with the natural flow of the bel canto line usually triumphed, even at some dangerously slow speeds; his Madame Butterfly, with Mirella Freni in the title role, exposes the tough psychological study embedded in a lush musical idiom.</p> <p>A new and significant post at the head of Berlin's Deutsche Oper, which he briefly took up in 1990, came to an end over details in the contract, though it did at least result in a shimmering, microscopically detailed recording of Strauss's Salome (the sequel, Elektra, made in Vienna, confirmed Sinopoli as an exacting master of Strauss's most complex scores). He moved instead to the Staatskapelle Dresden, where the marriage of this subtle, soft-grained institution with an altogether tougher and more aggressively intellectual master succeeded against all odds; earlier this year they undertook a punishing American tour. Sinopoli's long-term ambition to benefit from the fruits of his archaeological studies at Rome University, and to indulge them with a swift retirement from the world of music, was not to be fulfilled; though his schedule for the near future shows no suggestion that he was near to attaining his dream. There is, inevitably, a frustrating sense of incompleteness; but at least half of his recorded legacy makes an impressive testament.</p> <p>Sinopoli leaves behind a wife, Silvia, whom he married in 1979, and two sons.</p> <p>\u0095 Giuseppe Sinopoli, conductor and composer, born November 2 1946; died April 20 2001</p>",

Yet Sinopoli's surprising affinity with the natural flow of the bel canto line usually triumphed, even at some dangerously slow speeds; his Madame Butterfly, with Mirella Freni in the title role, exposes the tough psychological study embedded in a lush musical idiom. A new and significant post at the head of Berlin's Deutsche Oper, which he briefly took up in 1990, came to an end over details in the contract, though it did at least result in a shimmering, microscopically detailed recording of Strauss's Salome (the sequel, Elektra, made in Vienna, confirmed Sinopoli as an exacting master of Strauss's most complex scores). He moved instead to the Staatskapelle Dresden, where the marriage of this subtle, soft-grained institution with an altogether tougher and more aggressively intellectual master succeeded against all odds; earlier this year they undertook a punishing American tour. Sinopoli's long-term ambition to benefit from the fruits of his archaeological studies at Rome University, and to indulge them with a swift retirement from the world of music, was not to be fulfilled; though his schedule for the near future shows no suggestion that he was near to attaining his dream. There is, inevitably, a frustrating sense of incompleteness; but at least half of his recorded legacy makes an impressive testament. Sinopoli leaves behind a wife, Silvia, whom he married in 1979, and two sons. \u0095 Giuseppe Sinopoli, conductor and composer, born November 2 1946; died April 20 2001",

Autobiographies of former prime minister John Major, and his controversial chancellor Norman Lamont were even published on the same day two years ago, as both men raced to place their interpretations of Black Wednesday on the record. However, political tomes such as the chancellor and the education secretary have put their names to, on dry policy discussion, are generally putting out a political marker, rather than potential best-sellers.

      "bodyText": "William Hague's efforts to neutralise the race row enveloping his party were dealt a blow last night after it emerged that Tories in Kent had placed a newspaper advertisement seeking to tap into local fears about \"bogus\" asylum seekers. Former home secretary Michael Howard's constituency party in Folkestone and Hythe placed the advertisement, which a leading refugee charity said played blatantly on fears of racism. But the Conservative leader yesterday insisted that his party would not be diverted by allegations of racism from making asylum a key campaign issue in the coming election, as the fallout from three Tory MPs' refusal to sign a pledge not to pander to racial prejudice continued. Mr Hague's chief adviser on ethnic minority issues raised the stakes further by suggesting that the role of the commission for racial equality, which drew up the pledge, should be reviewed, suggesting it was addressing an agenda which had \"outlived its usefulness\". Mohammed Riaz, who exchanges ideas regularly with the Conservative leader on race issues, told the Guardian: \"A review is necessary, not because of the recent problems that the CRE has faced but because, as a body that has lasted many years, it is never ever clear what type of agenda they are working towards or what are their ultimate aims.\" Defending his local party's advertisement, Mr Howard said the rise in asylum claims was \"one of the most important issues\" in his constituency. Tension has been high in Kent over the issue, with groups helping asylum seekers reporting violence against those who say they are fleeing persecution.

Mr Hague, writing in the Sunday Telegraph, accused Labour of a \"shabby and contemptible\" attempt to gag his party over asylum, and shadow home secretary Ann Widdecombe dismissed the race pledge as \"silly\", suggesting Labour had accused the Tories of racism to hide its asylum policy failings. Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy urged Mr Hague to expel from his party all MPs who refuse to sign the pledge not to play the race card in the election campaign.

Meanwhile, the CRE faced accusations from former Conservative chairman Sir Brian Mawhinney and others of behaving irresponsibly and of being seen as partisan, with some Tories privately claiming the body had worked in league with Labour to embarrass the Conservatives over the compact. CRE chairman Gurbux Singh said the row over which MPs had signed its pledge had overshadowed the fact that all parties had failed on the race issue.

One Tory source said: \"If the CRE continue to behave in cahoots with and act as the mouthpiece of the Labour party, we may think of radical reform.\" A senior CRE source said claims that the watchdog had set out to embarrass the Tories were nonsense: \"It's not the commission scoring points, it's the Tories scoring own goals. Their stance on race is in complete disarray, they don't know if they're coming or going.\"",

Sportinglife.com, a joint venture by the Mirror and Press Association, and Soccernet are both on the block, as is (reportedly) Quokka sports, the webcasting sports site. Who will buy them? The usual suspects are all pulling out of sports websites, and rival websites, those that have already had acquisition pitches, are far too cash-strapped at the moment to risk feeling sorry for a competitor going out of business. According to sources close to Sportinglife, the site is currently being shopped around for about \u00a310m. It's all a different picture from that painted a few years ago when sports websites were jostling for market recognition by any means possible - the preferred way was to spend millions of pounds on a TV marketing campaign. Anyone remember that awful Kevin Keegan advert for Sportal during Euro 2000? And was it really only 12 months ago that BSkyB bought Sports Internet Group for a whopping \u00a3310m, an operation that is now valued by analysts at a meagre \u00a310m? Consolidation is said to be the word on everybody's lips, but some within the industry are not entirely convinced buying up the smaller players is the right strategy. Paul Wright, vice president of sales and marketing at Sports.com, a European offshoot of CBS SportsLine, asked what was the point of buying a desperate sports website when really all you buy is the staff, and that only adds more costs to your own bottom line? \"Sometimes it's better to sit it out, plod along, and wait for the market to pick up.\" \"It's a hard market at the moment, every penny is that much harder to get and it's all about weathering the storm.

      "bodyText": "The controversial poster for Yves St Laurent perfume featuring a naked Sophie Dahl accounted for a third of all complaints about poster advertising last year. Almost 1,000 people complained about the advert, according to figures published today in the Advertising Standards Authority's annual report. The ASA received 12,262 complaints last year, of which 2,696 were about poster adverts. National newspapers attracted 2,216 complaints while direct mail sparked 2,059 complaints. The second most complained about advert was for gas supplier Npower, which featured a ginger-haired family accompanied by the words: \"There are some things in life you can't choose\". The ASA received 219 complaints from people who believed the advert was offensive to redheads, but the authority ruled they were not justified because it was intended to be lighthearted. Other controversial campaigns included a poster of a woman's naked bottom for Marks &amp; Spencer, and one for Benetton featuring a prisoner on death row. Objections to two posters for underwear firm Gossard were upheld for being sexually explicit, and they were ordered to be removed.",

Journalists can wear expensive shoes and have the best training advice and stumble.</p> <p>I guess you either have it or you don't.</p> <p>In fact there were quite a few who had it yesterday. The pair of Tweenies, the clown with balloons on his head, the Scottish womble. All breezing by, chatting, exchanging DIY tips.</p> <p>To be fair, it wasn't the best of beginnings. Seven minutes after the gun sounded Fran - my running flatmate - and I still hadn't crossed the starting line. Congestion was to blame, with plastic bags and unwanted clothing flying through the air, bottles and banana skins occupying the tarmac. It was lethal, but we had been warned to expect anything.</p> <p>Somewhere, around three miles out, anything happened. It was turning out to be a pleasant jog when suddenly I was blessed. As we passed a church a priest appeared by the side of the road flicking water from a bowl with something which looked like a shaving brush.</p> <p>Some of his holy water may have landed on my shoe - I can't be sure - but I had an extra spring in my step for a few brief seconds. This was soon disturbed by the first toilet stop of the day -a rather nice Victorian number with ornate wrought iron railings and high ceilings.</p> <p>It was after this general relief that the real running began. Greenwich town came into view, and the crowds, which were already big, got bigger. People were shouting strange things at friends.</p> <p>Anyone who had their name on the front of their vest was suddenly public property. Screams of encouragement mixed with brass bands, terrible Beatles tribute bands and the sedate encouragement of the Pearly Kings and Queens looking surreal and arrestable in their uniforms.</p> <p>Past the Cutty Sark and on to Tower Bridge, which would mark the 12-mile point, I must have lived this part of the run at least a dozen times from the safety of my bed/armchair. I could hear David Coleman murmuring something about how plucky we all were, despite the fact that the real race was between the Rhino and the Tomato.</p> <p>All seemed well. Water stations every mile ensured that we were all wet and hydrated - there were even shower corridors you could pass through - a bit like a car wash which gave you a gentle sprinkle of water down your back and front.</p> <p>As the city neared, so the roads became thinner. We were all pressed together and at first we apologised for gashing each other's legs - then when we'd done it so many times we just grunted.</p> <p>The halfway mark was within reach and things were getting tiring. Tower Bridge loomed, magnificent and old - candy blue, with thousands of people screeching encouragement on either side.</p> <p>I knew what was coming next - and was prepared for it.

      "bodyText": "I was beaten by a tomato. Red and big and occupied - for all I know - by a real athlete. It puts it all into perspective now. Real athletes can wear tomatoes and win. Journalists can wear expensive shoes and have the best training advice and stumble. I guess you either have it or you don't. In fact there were quite a few who had it yesterday. The pair of Tweenies, the clown with balloons on his head, the Scottish womble. All breezing by, chatting, exchanging DIY tips. To be fair, it wasn't the best of beginnings. Seven minutes after the gun sounded Fran - my running flatmate - and I still hadn't crossed the starting line. Congestion was to blame, with plastic bags and unwanted clothing flying through the air, bottles and banana skins occupying the tarmac. It was lethal, but we had been warned to expect anything. Somewhere, around three miles out, anything happened. It was turning out to be a pleasant jog when suddenly I was blessed. As we passed a church a priest appeared by the side of the road flicking water from a bowl with something which looked like a shaving brush. Some of his holy water may have landed on my shoe - I can't be sure - but I had an extra spring in my step for a few brief seconds. This was soon disturbed by the first toilet stop of the day -a rather nice Victorian number with ornate wrought iron railings and high ceilings. It was after this general relief that the real running began. Greenwich town came into view, and the crowds, which were already big, got bigger. People were shouting strange things at friends. Anyone who had their name on the front of their vest was suddenly public property. Screams of encouragement mixed with brass bands, terrible Beatles tribute bands and the sedate encouragement of the Pearly Kings and Queens looking surreal and arrestable in their uniforms. Past the Cutty Sark and on to Tower Bridge, which would mark the 12-mile point, I must have lived this part of the run at least a dozen times from the safety of my bed/armchair. I could hear David Coleman murmuring something about how plucky we all were, despite the fact that the real race was between the Rhino and the Tomato. All seemed well. Water stations every mile ensured that we were all wet and hydrated - there were even shower corridors you could pass through - a bit like a car wash which gave you a gentle sprinkle of water down your back and front. As the city neared, so the roads became thinner. We were all pressed together and at first we apologised for gashing each other's legs - then when we'd done it so many times we just grunted. The halfway mark was within reach and things were getting tiring. Tower Bridge loomed, magnificent and old - candy blue, with thousands of people screeching encouragement on either side. I knew what was coming next - and was prepared for it. Just on 13 miles out I saw a small union flag fluttering in the distance and annoying someone's ear and then the words: \"there he is\". My parents had spotted me. We stopped for a brief chat, exchanged pleasantries and went on our way. So someone was watching after all.

      "bodyText": "Lennox Lewis's shock world heavyweight boxing title defeat attracted more than 1m viewers to BBC1 in the early hours of Sunday morning. World Heavyweight Championship Boxing, the BBC1's live coverage, began at 3.15am and ran until 5am. The programme had 1.2m viewers - nearly three quarters of people watching TV at that time, according to unofficial overnights. During the fight, the audience peaked at 1.4m viewers. The BBC director of sport, Peter Salmon, would have been encouraged to learn more than 0.5m viewers watched the fight in multichannel homes. But last night's repeat of the fight on BBC1 pulled in a disappointing 5m viewers. The 60-minute highlights show was screened between 7pm and 8pm last night and had a 21% audience share. It lost out to Lily Savage's Blankety Blank and Coronation Street on ITV. The comedy gameshow gained 6.8m viewers while Coronation Street pulled in 13.8m. BBC1's boxing highlights also failed to beat the 7pm-8pm slot average for the past month. An average 5.9m viewers have tuned in between those times to watch programmes such as Last of the Summer Wine, the Antiques Roadshow and Ballykissangel. ITV also won the battle of the revamped post-8pm peaktime line-ups thanks to a new Richard Wilson sitcom, High Stakes, and the returning feelgood drama, Where the Heart is. High Stakes, which stars Wilson and Jack Shepherd as two investment bankers constantly at odds with each other, debuted between 10pm and 10.30pm. It drew 5.9m viewers and a 29% audience share; beating BBC1's Ten o'Clock News, which had 4.9m. Where the Heart is returned between 8pm and 9pm and won its slot with 9.5m and a 36% audience share. Sunday is a problem night for the BBC but the new-look line-up performed better than previous Sunday fare. Ground Force at 8pm was followed by Alistair McGowan's Big Impression at 8.30pm. The new crime drama, Murder in Mind, was broadcast between 9pm and 10pm. Ground Force managed a steady 8m viewers and a 31% share, while Alistair McGowan pulled in 7.2m and had a 27% share. Last week's Son of God had just 4.2m between 7.50pm and 8.40pm. Murder in Mind, the first of seven self-contained stories written from the perspective of the murderer, had 6.4m and a 26% share in the difficult 9pm BBC1 slot. Overall, BBC1 raised its Sunday peaktime share by 3.5 percentage points to 26.2% compared with the previous week. On Friday night, Dom Joly made a triumphant return to Channel 4 with Trigger Happy TV between 9.30pm and 10pm. The second series, which has been backed by a big marketing push, opened with 3.4m viewers and a 15% audience share. It was up against BBC2 opposition Forgotten Heroes: Korea Remembered, which went out between 9pm and 9.50pm. The BBC2 documentary about the British army's heroic stand at the battle of the Imjin River had 2.8m viewers and a 12% share.",

      "body": "<p>Two years ago the biggest problem Piers Morgan faced was what he would like to do next. At 34 he was presiding over a Mirror that had visibly turned a corner: it was confident and sharp and making more waves than a weakened and uncertain Sun. The circulation had stabilised even if it wasn't going up, and the paper was becoming a must-read. Possible solutions were floated: a bigger job within the Mirror Group - maybe an editorial director role across more of the titles; maybe on the board. His greatest worry was: where do you go from editor of the second biggest-selling daily newspaper at 34? </p> <p>At least 18 of the intervening 24 months have not been kind to Morgan. And the worst of it is that he brought most of it upon himself. The share-dealing debacle which broke in February last year through a small story on page four of the Telegraph is still going on - the DTI has yet to report a conclusion to its lengthy investigation into the \u00a320,000 worth of Viglen shares that Morgan bought the day before they were tipped in his newspaper. But he has been publicly vilified through the pages of rival newspapers - notably David Yelland's Sun, which has revelled in its rival's distress, laying into Morgan, Sir Victor Blank and Philip Graf, the chairman and chief executive of Trinity Mirror. </p> <p>Morgan has remained largely silent on the subject - save for a couple of contrite company-issued expressions of regret - for nearly 18 months now, a shadow of his formerly boisterous self. But now it's time to emerge from behind the locked doors and give his first newspaper interview since the share-dealing scandal. \"I feel like I've been under a cloud for too long. Regardless of what the DTI does, it's just gone on too long.\" </p> <p>It's now because Trinity Mirror has made its most public declaration of faith in him yet. He has signed a new contract (a lucrative, five-year deal, according to the trade press) which makes him \"effective\" editor in chief of the Sunday Mirror as well as editor of the daily. It's not quite the seat on the board, but it's as close as a man still under investigation can probably get. </p> <p>Morgan is suitably grateful. \"I have regularly throughout this, particularly at the start, thought that a lot of lesser managements would have turfed me straight out the door. I thought that from the first week onwards when it really began to accelerate and the Sun really stuck the boot in. And I've been absolutely staggered by the support from the company led by Victor and Philip Graf and the rest of the board, who have all stuck their necks out for me and refused to alter their position. </p> <p>\"We all know the DTI are continuing their investigation and no one can say with 100% certainty how that will end because we're not them. I remain confident, like the company does, that I did nothing wrong. But until that position changes, they are perfectly entitled to carry on business as usual.\" </p> <p>This bullishness despite the continuing rancour of some of the press. \"We're down to a few diehards now: Richard Ingrams, David Yelland, Andrew Neil and the Sunday Busi ness and a couple of others who just keep saying the same thing. I've got the picture - I may be a cretinous greedy stupid little idiot but I'm still editing the Mirror and that's my day job. So they can keep saying it and I can keep just laughing because eventually you laugh.\" </p> <p>He wasn't laughing last year. \"Debilitating\" is the word he uses to describe the mass of coverage, and there's no doubt that Fleet Street made the most of the opportunity to heap ordure on the head of one of its finest. The most stinging pieces were the ones addressed directly to the integrity of Blank and Graf: how can you, as men of honour, tolerate this behaviour in your company, as the Sun asked frequently. Did Morgan ever think that they would sack him? \"Regularly. Oh yeah, regularly. Yeah. Because I think if you're getting the level of press coverage that I was getting then the pressure on management is ferocious. That's why I say I owe them a huge debt of loyalty.\" </p> <p>Did you ever resign? \"No. There's a big difference between thinking you might have to go and resigning. Never resign. There's no point.\" </p> <p>Resignation is of course the reason why Morgan has this new job. It's the official explanation for Colin Myler's departure as editor of the Sunday Mirror two weeks ago after he published an article which caused the Leeds footballers' trial to be abandoned. Myler had fallen on his sword within the week. If you were him, you might feel somewhat aggrieved that the board of Trinity Mirror, which has seen fit to back one editor so enthusiastically, accepted his resignation with such alacrity. </p> <p>Morgan sees a distinct difference. \"It was a combination of things. In the end if the judge had come back on the Monday and said, 'That was a bit naughty but the trial continues,' it would have been a rap over the knuckles and we probably wouldn't be where we are. Unfortunately what happened was the \u00a38m high-profile trial of the year collapsed and it was totally unprecedented. There's a big school of thought that the judge made the wrong decision, but that's a different issue. </p> <p>\"If you're the editor of a paper where a trial collapses because of a story you've published I think you have to carry the can. I think Colin accepted that and he's got great sympathy from his colleagues for doing it.\" </p> <p>Yet as someone who's had quite a lot of second chances, Morgan must surely feel that Myler should have been given one. \"People are trying to say, 'Well, what about the shares thing,' and they forget the company's position on the shares thing, which is that they did a massive internal investigation and they decided I'd done nothing wrong so there was no reason for me to leave.\" </p> <p>It's almost a year since the press complaints commission issued its strongly worded rebuke to Morgan, Blank and Graf over their handling of the share-buying culture at Trinity Mirror. Morgan, it found, had breached the code of conduct on three counts and the company was warned that its rules on share dealing for its journalists were inadequate. The City Slickers, Anil Bhoyrul and James Hipwell, whose column exhorted readers to \"fill your boots\" by piling into new technology stocks, were fired for gross misconduct and came very badly out of the PCC ruling. In the madness surrounding rev elation after revelation of shares being ramped, hacks making thousands and readers being ripped off, the entire Mirror newsroom seemed to be implicated in what was termed a culture of greed. \"There's no evidence of the culture,\" Morgan insists. \"The culture's a great myth. Hardly anybody on the floor bought shares and hardly anybody had any connection with any Slickers tips at all. It was a countrywide culture of piling into new technology stocks. Clearly when you go back now and study the language [the Slickers] used it looks like everything's a share ramp. Everything was 'fill your boots'. I didn't see it as share ramping, more a bit of fun with the stock market. We learned a very salutary lesson: you can't have fun with the stock market without it ending in the way that it did.\" </p> <p>Oddly, he still seems to feel that Bhoyrul and Hipwell (both fired and still also under investigation by the DTI) got off lightly. \"I think the Slickers have avoided most of the criticism that they probably should get for what they've done. They know what they did and they're City journalists - they should've been much more au fait with how it works than anybody else.\" </p> <p>But as their editor, wasn't he responsible for them? \"Totally. I totally held my hands up and said the managerial responsibility failed completely. Completely. And made mugs of all of us. After the PCC adjudication what was clear to me afterwards was it was bloody stupid of me to ever think that I could actively trade in the stock market and not at some stage come into conflict with the paper.\" </p> <p>The paper, the paper. Morgan loves the Mirror. Perhaps not since MacKenzie ruled the Sun has an editor been so attached to a paper. He thinks it's his and is genuinely still mystified that anyone could believe he would deliberately defraud Mirror readers. \"Naive, stupid, yes - add any adjective you like. Was I in some way criminally minded about it or crooked or out to fleece the readers? It is so unlike the person I think people know I am to even consider . . . That's the thing that upset me most: that people would call into question that I would be like that with the paper, because I put my heart and soul into it and I just wouldn't do that.\" </p> <p>He talks about the new supplements (the A List, the Look, M magazine) that have been added to the paper in recent months and lambasts the Sun (again) for not doing likewise. There can be no doubt that he remains as editor of the Mirror because the paper is deemed a success. If the board didn't like where it was going, he would have been fired last May. But no one wanted to sack Morgan, even though it was by no means the first time he had been seriously warned by the PCC. Let's not forget the Countess Spencer report for the News of the World in 1995, when Rupert Murdoch was forced to intervene, or even \"Achtung Surrender!\", the rabble-rousing Euro 96 headline. </p> <p>Somehow he keeps managing to get back up. \"Most of my cock-ups have been errors of judgment that have not led to catastrophe, financial meltdown or trials collapsing or whatever - and that's probably been my saving grace. 'Achtung Surrender!' was just my shockingly bad humour even though it caused mayhem, and I apologised for my humour. Most of it was calls like that. </p> <p>\"Generally, my legal record, for example, has been extremely good. Last year was the best year for the Mirror legally in about 25 years. I take libel and stuff like that very seriously because that's where you get hammered financially.\" </p> <p>Money is the key to Morgan's assessment of damage done. The difference between himself and Colin Myler, he explains, is that Myler's mistake cost money. This, he seems to imply, was the unforgivable sin (\"my mistakes never cost anyone any money\"). Try to gently suggest that there are other things as important as the monetary cost, such as ethics and reputation, and he does briefly look puzzled before he recovers. \"Of course. Of course. We've all got ethics.\" (But rather in a tone as if to say, \"we all get spots\"). </p> <p>And there's the fact that the paper's performance, though not outstanding in sales terms, has largely been unaffected by the back-of-house shenanigans. Morgan claims it as a 2% sales fall year-on-year - still negative but a big improvement on the 10% year-on-year drop the paper was experiencing when he arrived in November 1995. </p> <p>Still, there's something deeply ironic in the fact that our most controversial editor - the one who has drunk in the regulator's last chance saloon more than any other - is, far from being sacked, now assuming editor in chief responsibility for another paper as well as his own, even if the strategy of forcing the two titles to work together makes perfect sense. With the new editor, Tina Weaver - who has been his deputy on the Mirror and launched the successful women's magazine M which has just been moved from Tuesday to Saturday - he intends to run a seven-day show. Not, he hastens to add, a seven-day operation in the sense of a merged staff, rather one brand and a joint-effort approach to stories in an attempt to lift the lacklustre performance of the Sunday title. </p> <p>It's almost as if the rumbustious spaniel that was Piers Morgan has metamorphosed into older, wiser, corporate Piers. There's the new job, he looks a lot older (36, now) and he is answering questions in a measured, careful way. There is corporate-speak and regret tempering much of the old devil-may-care attitude. </p> <p>No longer the youngest editor in Fleet Street, he's been in situ at the Mirror for six years. You might think that his years of outspoken profile-building, first at the Sun as the friend-to-the-stars editor of the Bizarre column and then, in 1994, for a year at the News of the World, are over. Perhaps it is now time for Morgan to adopt an elder statesman persona. </p> <p>But he just can't keep it up for long. After an hour or so of \"of course I don't underestimate the seriousness of this situation\" and \"I'm very grateful for the loyalty of the board\", he's handing out grotesque cartoonish insults left, right and centre to those he feels have done him wrong and railing against the newspaper industry for being no fun. Though his greatest outrage has been reserved thus far for the \"lawless\" antics of the Sun and certain broadsheets (Sunday Business and the Times, though the Guardian does not escape his wrath) in covering his misfortunes, when he starts to relax he launches an extraordinary appeal for a return to the old days. </p> <p>\"Fleet Street's become very boring. There's too much attention to methodology and all this kind of stuff. When I first came into Fleet Street it was lawless. Totally lawless. Indiscriminate stories being published with no attention to law, the press complaints commission, anything else.\" This, I venture, is how he ended up at the centre of a DTI investigation. \"I know it is. There's so many regulations, it's ridiculous. Unleash the dogs! Let us back in! I want my tabloids back! We want to cause mayhem again. It's what we're about. We're not the Economist; we should be upsetting and enraging and entertaining and all the rest of it.\" </p> <p>The threats are still as excessive as ever (see above) and he's fond of using the word Sicilian when describing his planned revenge against Yelland as if he were the Godfather, but it's when he launches into a tirade about the staid nature of the British Press Awards and the lack of joie de vivre among today's journalists that he's vintage Morgan. </p> <p>\"If it falls to me to eradicate this cancer of boring tedious journalism with my trusty sword of juvenility and my shield of unruly behaviour, then so be it.\" Being Morgan, he later emails me a revised version of this epigram, which better apes the grammar of Jonathan Aitken's original. But as this is the boring old Guardian, we'll stick with the genuine article.</p>",

We didn't need brand new stuff, video wasn't accessible when we first started club visuals, and this was the place to get the 16mm projectors etc. It fitted in with our retro-sampling aesthetic, the cine thing.

Do you change your approach much or is corporate hospitality the new rock n' roll?</p> <p><strong>LS</strong> Doing a stage event for a independent label or a live show for UNKLE is totally different to corporate hospitality events. Live gigs like Propellerheads and Cornershop mean we have to make it more theatrical, you're performing as the band are performing, illustrating the music with visuals. We produce visuals for each track and then jazz it out. For UNKLE our visual set was very tightly laid down and orchestrated. A DJ or turntablist thing makes it more important to have visuals because there's no singer to dribble over. Corporate events pay the rent, and we give them credibility and transform a space for them. We're not anti-commercialism, we mix both. Luckily the commercial clients we work for are buying into what we do, so it's not like we're forced into doing something we wouldn't want to. If you can combine them that's perfect.</p> <p><strong>SD</strong> How long until you make your first feature film?</p> <p><strong>LS</strong> We've just got our first short film - Thumbnail Express - out the way. It makes up part of EM, which is a live exploded documentary. But Thumbnail Express will also become part of a larger series, Gilligan's Travels, that we've been developing with onedotzero. Once complete this should be consumed on TV, but the live event is a different experience. We've a plan to make a short sci-fi film next using the methods we've explored with our experimentation with projection and graphics. There's always a question of funding when you're doing something different and not through the usual routes, and all the time learning about a craft too.</p> <p> <strong>SD</strong> . . . and why did you choose to make a documentary?</p> <p><strong>LS</strong> It seemed a logical extension of what we'd been doing. We worked on a design exhibition in 99 and collected material in the states, including audio. It was the first time we captured our own audio, started showing this with projections, and thought one of the interviews would work well as a short. This was commissioned for onedotzero4. Our background in listening to music and illustrating it visually, means it came together as 'inverse film-making', back to front. Don't do it at home. But the interview meant we had a ready made script so didn't have to make this bit up.</p> <p><strong>SD</strong> A lot of well known film-makers \u00dc Mike Figgis and Ken Russell come to mind - are experimenting with new forms of film and new ways of making them. How do you view this?</p> <p><strong>LS</strong> What holds film back from being really mad and experimental is where it's shown. Cinemas only show formula stuff. That's why forums like the onedotzero festival or organic film clubs like the Halloween Society, or hybrid club events are so important now. Ken Russell has always made pretty unconventional films, but nowadays what defines a film is getting it shown - the definition of what a film is is changing. The convergence of traditional film, graphic design, new media and internet means that people are exposed to and are more accepting of these new forms. But you'll always get the purists too. Technology shouldn't lead you into a film form, it should just open the creative possibilities, and give more access to do it. The tools are there now. It's easy for us to make film now because we've got [software video-editing package] Final Cut Pro and a G4.</p> <p><strong>SD</strong>. How soon will your work be online? How do you see yourselves fitting in with the whole cybercinema movement?</p> <p><strong>LS</strong> We want it to be online, beginning of next year - but we've got so many events and projects that it's hard to find the time. The 'me tv' idea is pretty crazy. I'll like to use the internet as an imagebank for us, so people could see the process and how we make up a visual show. We want to communicate to more people and this is an amazing way to do it. We don't see ourselves as part of a movement, we're not stuck on digital either, we've used analogue methods so long.

Human Rights Watch describes the situation as a transition from an internal armed conflict to a classic dirty war. <br> <p><b>How extensive is this dirty war?</b> Human Rights Watch has documented more than 113 cases of \"disappearances\" in Chechnya since Russia launched its military campaign against the rebellious province in September 1999. A leading Russian human rights group, the Memorial Human Rights Centre, put the figure at 150, but the full number is believed to be much higher.

      "bodyText": "Is there a dirty war? Conventional fighting between Russian and Chechen forces has for the most part ceased, but human rights organisations have reported a rise in the disappearance, torture and summary executions of detainees. Human Rights Watch describes the situation as a transition from an internal armed conflict to a classic dirty war. How extensive is this dirty war? Human Rights Watch has documented more than 113 cases of \"disappearances\" in Chechnya since Russia launched its military campaign against the rebellious province in September 1999. A leading Russian human rights group, the Memorial Human Rights Centre, put the figure at 150, but the full number is believed to be much higher. The total number of dead from the military campaign is estimated at between 30,000 and 40,000. Has there been any international response? Last week, the UN Commission on Human Rights condemned Russia for what it said was the \"excessive and indiscriminate\" use of force by its troops in Chechnya. But Russia is not paying much attention. A similar UN resolution was approved last year, but Russia simply ignored calls to allow UN human rights monitors into Chechnya or to set up a national commission of inquiry.

The broadcaster also wants to launch a comedy drama made in Scotland to demonstrate a greater commitment to regional programming. The commitments come as part of Channel 4's \"statement of promises\", a new programme contract that replaces the Independent Television Commission's annual performance reviews. Under the new deregulated programming landscape, broadcasters will set out their programming stalls for the coming year. If the system is felt to be inadequate by the new regulatory body, Ofcom, it can impose sanctions. Channel 4 said in its statement of promises that it wants to \"use [its] reputation for risk and non-conformism to engage a younger generation in the values of public service broadcasting\". As part of its commitment, Channel 4 said it wants to concentrate on \"experimenting with programmes at the boundary of drama and documentary\". It is promising to screen a feature-length story of rail privatisation by Ken Loach called The Navigators, and Kenneth Branagh in Shackleton, a feature-length profile of the Artic explorer by Charles Sturridge, who directed Longitude. Meanwhile, Channel 4 promises to introduce more international programming into the True Stories strand, with Russia, Iran and Africa chosen for particular attention. The broadcaster is also committed to two \"landmark authored\" series, one by Darcus Howe on Britain and one on America by Jon Ronson. Relevant story 23.04.2001: Promises, promises, promises",

Liberal Democrats recognise that minority ethnic groups in Britain look not for special favours, but for equality of opportunity. Liberal Democrats offer minority ethnic groups in Britain a real chance for real change. Charles Kennedy, Leader of the Liberal Democrats Equality and the Fight Against Racial Discrimination</p> <p>Liberal Democrats will combat discrimination on the grounds of race and in all its other forms. We will:</p> <p>Strengthen the fight against discrimination with an Equality Act. This will fight unfair discrimination on whatever grounds, including race and religion. A new Equality Commission will be able to investigate potential breaches of the Act and take action in its own name. We will also create a separate Human Rights Commission to safeguard human rights.</p> <p>Support recent European anti-discrimination legislation. We will back measures under Article 13 of the Treaty of Amsterdam on anti-discrimination, including race and employment legislation and action. This will allow British Citizens from ethnic minorities travelling or working in Europe to be protected from discrimination.</p> <p>Immigrants are too often labelled as a problem for British society. Britain has benefited hugely from immigration, in the same way that many Britons who have emigrated have benefited from their experience. There are practical as well as humanitarian reasons for having a fair immigration system. The shortage of skilled workers in many fields means immigrants have an important contribution to make to British society. We will:</p> <p>Free immigration laws from discrimination. We will ensure that immigration policy is non-discriminatory in its application. We will reform current immigration laws so that families are not divided. We will also regularly review immigration policy, separate from our asylum obligations, including an assessment of skills needs of the country in an increasingly global economy. We will reverse the present Government's decision to charge fees for appealing family visit visa applications.</p> <p>Protect people fleeing from persecution by dealing with asylum applications fairly and more quickly. We will introduce fair benefits for asylum seekers to replace the demeaning voucher system. We will review the failing dispersal system, end any unnecessary restrictions on asylum seekers undertaking voluntary work and review restrictions on paid work by asylum seekers in their first six months. Recognising pressures on host communities, we will ensure that local services are adequately compensated for the cost of supporting asylum seekers. We will work with other countries to ensure that responsibilities are sensibly shared, and to seek a system which discourages illegal trafficking in people.</p> <p>\"The history of immigration is one of success for our country. The integration of immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers has been truly remarkable. Their contribution is important and valued\". Lord Dholakia, President of the Liberal Democrats.</p> <p>Equality of Opportunity and the Public Services</p> <p>Liberal Democrats believe that the top political priority for the people of Britain, regardless of their ethnic background, is to secure high levels of investment in the essential public services on which we all depend. Adequate funding of the public services are especially important for less advantaged communities, because this is the only way they will be able to secure fair access to a decent education and good quality healthcare. When public services are under-funded, it is the ethnic minorities who will lose out most of all. Only the Liberal Democrats have a clear and costed commitment to make significant increases in the major public services. We will:</p> <p>Provide improvements in education costing more than \u00a33 billion a year, funded by putting one penny on the basic rate of income tax.</p> <p>Provide substantial immediate increases in pensions and raise investment in the NHS, funded by setting a new top tax rate of 50% on income over \u00a3100,000 a year and by closing loopholes in Capital Gains Tax.</p> <p>Liberal Democrats also recognise that some ethnic or religious groups have special needs or sensitivities which must be taken into account in the delivery of public services, particularly healthcare and education. In particular, we will:</p> <p>End the use of mixed sex wards so that patients have more dignity when they are in hospital.</p> <p>Promote a wider availability of complementary medicines and healthcare through the NHS to take maximum advantage of different approaches to health.</p> <p>Replace the National Curriculum with a less rigid Minimum Curriculum Entitlement which can be more sensitive to community preferences. We will provide for a broad and balanced curriculum including languages, science, maths, the humanities, physical development (including sports instruction and advice on healthy eating), religious education, parenting, citizenship and creative arts.</p> <p>Improve access for under-represented groups in Higher Education by tripling the incentive payments for recruitment and retention of under-represented, mature and part-time students. We would pay colleges one-third on admission and two-thirds on completion of a course.</p> <p>Liberal Democrats recognise the best way to ensure that the public services are sensitive to the needs of minority ethic groups is to enhance political participation by and representation of this section of the community. To promote wider representation in political office, we will:</p> <p>Secure fair votes for all national and local elections. For Westminster, we support the system of AV+ as proposed by the Jenkins Commission as a first step. We will therefore put the Jenkins Commission's recommendations before the British people in a referendum at the earliest possible opportunity. Ultimately, we wish to see the Single Transferable Vote (STV) used for Westminster elections. We will introduce STV immediately for local government and European elections.</p> <p>Include in our Equality Act provisions to permit political parties to employ proportionate positive measures in their selection processes to remedy under-representation of one sex or of minority groups in public office.</p> <p>\"Our vision is to provide the right infrastructure, the right environment, the right opportunities - the right playing field - and then to set people free to shape their communities, shape their lives, celebrate their success. Because we are honest about the cost, we know we can deliver that opportunity. Because we trust the people, we know they will make those opportunities work.\" Matthew Taylor, Liberal Democrat Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer.</p> <p>Equality and the Legal System</p> <p>Good police relationships with the community are essential to effective policing. Relationships with ethnic minority communities have been particularly strained recently in the wake of the inquiry into the Stephen Lawrence murder investigation. Liberal Democrats support implementation of the positive recommendations of the Macpherson Report. We welcome the start that has been made, such as the Metropolitan Police's new race and ethnic task force, but recognise that much more needs to be done. We will:</p> <p>Make the police more accountable. Public confidence in the police has declined. As well as seeking to improve the visibility of the police and improving police relations with the community, we will create a genuinely independent police complaints system to deal with complaints speedily, efficiently and impartially. We will encourage police forces to be more representative of the communities they serve, and ensure that 'stop and search' is based on intelligence and attaches no relevance to the race or colour of those stopped by the police.</p> <p>Tackle hate crimes. We will establish police hate crime investigation units to coordinate information and action against racist and other hate crimes.</p> <p>Liberal Democrats recognise that ethnic minorities also have concerns about the way in which the courts and the prison system treat ethnic minority citizens who come into contact with them. Ethnic minorities comprise a disproportionate share of the prison population. We will:</p> <p>Retain jury trials for middle ranking cases currently threatened by Labour's Mode of Trial Bill, so that defendants can choose be tried by a jury representative of the community rather than a predominantly white magistracy, and restore the right to silence.</p> <p>\"For my constituents, and for those of many of us who represent multiracial communities, these are day-to-day issues. Twenty-five per cent. of my constituents are black or Asian. It is not just that many experience discrimination, and find that they have a greater chance of being excluded from school or doing less well there, or of being arrested or detained by the police, or of going to prison, or of being out of work. Nearly every week, people come to my surgery and tell me that they are being racially harassed, simply because of the colour of their skin.\" Simon Hughes, Liberal Democrat Shadow Home Secretary.</p> <p>Equality of Opportunity in the Economy</p> <p>Ethnic minority communities often live in economically disadvantaged areas, characterised by low pay, poor housing, high unemployment and poor access to financial services. To boost the prosperity of these communities, we will:</p> <p>Review the minimum wage annually. The review will follow the recommendations of the Low Pay Commission. Equal work deserves equal pay, so we will also extend the full Minimum Wage to all those aged 16 and over, abolishing the lower rate paid to people under 21.</p> <p>Remove taxation for the lowest paid. We believe that people start paying tax at too low a level and will work to reduce the burden of taxation on the low paid. Over time, we will cut the 10p tax rate to zero. At present, this would take 1.4 million people on low incomes out of tax altogether.</p> <p>Regenerate deprived communities wherever they are through a one-stop Single Regeneration Grant system. This would streamline existing regeneration measures. We will ensure that all regeneration schemes are truly in line with the aspirations of the communities they are designed to help by strengthening local democratic input into decision-making.</p> <p>Tackle financial exclusion by promoting community banking, Local Exchange and Trading Schemes (LETS), and credit unions. We will reform the regulations governing credit unions to make it easier to run non-interest schemes for Muslims.</p> <p>Self-employment and small business are a particularly important route to economic advancement for ethnic minorities. To help small businesses create wealth and employment, we will:</p> <p>Scrap unnecessary business regulations. We have published a list of 25 specific major regulations which we will scrap. We believe new regulations should where appropriate be subject to a \"sunset clause\", setting a deadline after which they would automatically lapse. We will also consult business before introducing any new measures.</p> <p>Cut business rates on small businesses by introducing a Business Rates Allowance, similar to personal tax allowances. This tax free allowance would be set at \u00a31500 and apply to all small businesses. With larger businesses paying a little more to cover the cost of the scheme, smaller businesses will pay less.</p> <p>Promote diversity of ownership. We will initiate a review of policy governing mutual ownership of building societies, insurance companies and credit unions to encourage and develop them.</p> <p>\"In a fair society, business ownership must not be restricted to those with a particular background. The spirit of entrepreneurship should be nurtured in all sections of the community, everyone should be enabled to embark on their own enterprise regardless of age, ethnicity or gender.\" Brian Cotter, Liberal Democrat Small Business Spokesperson.</p> <p>Equality and Religion</p> <p>Liberal Democrats recognise that many cultural groups are defined by religious faith, rather than by ethnic group. The Runnymede Trust has produced a report on Islamaphobia, but discrimination on the grounds of religion is not limited to Muslims. Religion can be one of the most important factors in determining how a person is seen by his or her colleagues and acquaintances, and so there needs to be adequate legislation, along the same lines as existing race legislation. We will:</p> <p>Include on census and other information-gathering questionnaires an optional question on religious faith or background. We would ensure that this information was used in the same way as information on ethnic background is currently used.</p> <p>Introduce legislation protecting people from religious discrimination through our proposed Equality Act. This legislation should be equivalent to existing race discrimination legislation, subject to necessary exemptions and exceptions. It could also apply to those who claim they have been unfairly discriminated against on the basis of a lack of a particular religious belief.</p> <p>Liberal Democrats believe that there should be legal parity between all religions and religious groups and that no one religion or denomination should receive preferential treatment. We will:</p> <p>Abolish the existing Blasphemy Laws, which are discriminatory in their application.</p> <p>Create a source of funding and support for those groups which feel unable to accept lottery funding due to their beliefs.</p> <p>In the longer term, support the disestablishment of the Church of England.</p> <p>\"The purpose of our proposed Equality Act is to extend the life chances of people disadvantaged through belonging to groups discriminated against by British Society. To right this wrong, and to make meaningful the concept of citizenship, of living in a civilised society, we need the statutory remedy of true and enforceable equality before the law.\" Robert Maclennan, Liberal Democrat Shadow Cabinet Spokesperson on Constitutional Affairs.</p> <p>Equality of Opportunity World Wide</p> <p>Britain's membership of the UN Security Council, the Commonwealth, the EU, NATO, and other global bodies gives us a key role in world affairs. But with power comes responsibility. We must not turn a blind eye to poverty, nor support authoritarian regimes which oppress their people and threaten world stability. Britain's influence should be used to fight for human rights and equitable and peaceful relationships between nations.</p> <p>The Liberal Democrat approach puts democratic values, human rights and good governance at the top of the foreign policy agenda. We advocate effective aid policies to address the greatest problems of developing countries and promote democracy and good governance. We will:</p> <p>Honour the UK's commitment to meet the UN target of increasing overseas aid to 0.7% over the next ten years. We support the moves already made by the British Government to reduce the debts of the world's poorest countries. But Britain could take the lead in favour of more rapid action on debt relief by bodies such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Their Poverty Reduction Strategy Programmes should attach at least as much importance to governments taking action to tackle poverty as to liberalising their economies.</p> <p>End links between aid and trade. Tied aid is a form of protectionism which inhibits development. We will subject all aid programmes to thorough assessment for their environmental, social and human rights consequences.</p> <p>Promote genuine liberal trade. Trade underpins well-being throughout the world, but does not mean a right of the powerful to exploit the powerless, or make them more dependent. We want global trade to be based on rules and dispute settlement within the World Trade Organisation. But we also want WTO and EU rules to establish internationally recognised standards and labelling to allow consumers to exercise informed and ethical choice.</p> <p>Press for a global competition authority within the WTO. This would co-ordinate the anti-monopoly activities of individual nations in order to tackle the growing concentration of corporate monopoly power more effectively.</p> <p>Work with Britain's partners in the Commonwealth to make it more effective in promoting conflict resolution, good governance and democratic values.</p> <p>\"The fact is that the in our increasingly interdependent world, the assertion \"No man is an island\" is moving from the status of moral precept to a statement of hard political reality. We can now only prosper, have a context of stability in which to live our lives and assure a safe environment for our children if we are prepared, not just to recognise our global interdependence on each other, but also give it some political form in effective structures which provide an element of global governance.\" Sir Paddy Ashdown, former Leader of the Liberal Democrats.</p>",

The Liberal Democrat approach puts democratic values, human rights and good governance at the top of the foreign policy agenda. We advocate effective aid policies to address the greatest problems of developing countries and promote democracy and good governance. We will: Honour the UK's commitment to meet the UN target of increasing overseas aid to 0.7% over the next ten years. We support the moves already made by the British Government to reduce the debts of the world's poorest countries. But Britain could take the lead in favour of more rapid action on debt relief by bodies such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Their Poverty Reduction Strategy Programmes should attach at least as much importance to governments taking action to tackle poverty as to liberalising their economies. End links between aid and trade. Tied aid is a form of protectionism which inhibits development. We will subject all aid programmes to thorough assessment for their environmental, social and human rights consequences. Promote genuine liberal trade. Trade underpins well-being throughout the world, but does not mean a right of the powerful to exploit the powerless, or make them more dependent. We want global trade to be based on rules and dispute settlement within the World Trade Organisation. But we also want WTO and EU rules to establish internationally recognised standards and labelling to allow consumers to exercise informed and ethical choice. Press for a global competition authority within the WTO. This would co-ordinate the anti-monopoly activities of individual nations in order to tackle the growing concentration of corporate monopoly power more effectively. Work with Britain's partners in the Commonwealth to make it more effective in promoting conflict resolution, good governance and democratic values. \"The fact is that the in our increasingly interdependent world, the assertion \"No man is an island\" is moving from the status of moral precept to a statement of hard political reality. We can now only prosper, have a context of stability in which to live our lives and assure a safe environment for our children if we are prepared, not just to recognise our global interdependence on each other, but also give it some political form in effective structures which provide an element of global governance.\" Sir Paddy Ashdown, former Leader of the Liberal Democrats.",

The home secretary said the figures were a result of the first year's \u00a340m investment from the government's crime fighting fund. Opposition critics said police numbers were still far lower than when Labour took office. Every force in England and Wales saw an overall rise in the number of recruits, except Hertfordshire. The Home Office statistics showed that 7,009 new recruits began residential training in 2000-2001, compared with 3,963 in the previous year, an increase of 76.9%. The largest increase was in the Yorkshire and Humber region with a rise of 168%. The home secretary announced the figures as he met the new intake at the Metropolitan police's training centre at Hendon, north London. \"Forces are to be congratulated on their efforts to recruit more officers,\" Mr Straw said. \"With nearly 40% of the total number of recruits coming through the crime fighting fund this is a sure sign that the government's increased funding for the police is delivering results.\" The shadow home secretary, Ann Widdecombe, said of the figures: \"Although they are saying a 75% increase, what they neglect to tell you is that that of course was the lowest level to which they themselves have allowed recruitment to fall. \"If you compare the current numbers not with that but with those that they inherited there is precious little increase at all.\" Mr Straw said: \"The figures are very good - they show recruitment is rising very rapidly. \"Police numbers have been falling since 1993 because of the state of the public finances.\" Mr Straw acknowledged that retaining police was also important and said fewer officers left the force through either resignations or retirements in 1999-2000. Labour was obliged to stick with the Conservatives' public spending plans for the first two years in power, he added. Simon Hughes, Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, said: \"More police officers are, of course, welcome. \"But better figures in the last month before the general election can't make up for four years of inadequate funding, belated interest and broken promises by this Labour government.\" Related articles 05.03.2001: Budget to give public jobs boost 17.04.2001: Blair to shake up police culture Useful links Police services of the UK Press release: Police recruits up 77% - Home Office",

      "body": "<p>In a significant break with the past, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 are publishing formal programme statements tomorrow, for the first time ever. These express their philosophy and what they expect to put on screen and achieve in the current year. They also look forward, in very general terms, to 2002 - without giving good ideas away to the opposition. The \"contracts with viewers\" (see above) matter because they are a dry run for the new deregulated system backed by the communications white paper, due to become a wide-reaching statute in 2003. </p> <p>A government task force is putting the finishing touches to the bill, so it will be complete - apart from the controversial new rules allowing concentrated media ownership - by the time the new government is formed. The programme statements therefore represent the first concrete sign of how a so-called \"light touch\" regime will try to maintain the variety and quality that still distinguishes British television, by placing the onus on the broadcasters. </p> <p>Too trusting for a system that rashly axed News at Ten? \"The great benefit is that we get a dry run for a year, backed by what is in the current licences, and we will see how clear and how bankable it is,\" says Patricia Hodgson, chief executive of the Independent Television Commission, architect of the scheme. </p> <p>Hodgson aims to \"update the [programme] requirements to match audience needs\". But can that be achieved in a highly competitive world suddenly facing a downturn? The communications white paper, remember, proposed three tiers of regulation. The first covers everyone including BSkyB, and requires compliance with basic codes and standards (requiring impartial news, for example). The second tier gives the new regulator - Ofcom - powers to set and enforce clear targets for the quantifiable things, regional news in peak time, investment in original programming. The programme statements under debate here mainly cover the third tier, all those qualitative public-service programme duties, including documentaries and arts expected of ITV, Channel 4 and, it seems certain, of Channel 5 too. </p> <p>At the end of the year, channels and individual ITV franchisees will have to report on how they have measured up. With their licences simplified, the statements are seen as a means of \"getting away from a group of us in a small room trying to make a contract with audiences\", says Sarah Thane, ITC director of programmes. \"They have to report back to their audiences on how well they have done. It's all public.\" In other words, the audiences will play a big part in keeping ITV honest. </p> <p>Hodgson sketches out how Ofcom will enforce standards. In the first year, it will report on each licence holder's performance: \"If it isn't wonderful, it will say so. In the second year, if there is a 'major and persistent' departure from an (agreed) remit, Ofcom can direct a franchise holder to make changes. If they still fail, it can use sanctions, fines, shortening licences, as happens now.\" So the \"light touch\" can still be followed by the stick if good intentions waver. </p> <p>Thane says, however, that these new programme statements, the companies' own handiwork, have a greater commitment to detail than the regulator could have asked for. The prize of self-regulation and flexibility is clearly desirable and all have been on their best behaviour in this interim period. For ITV, the profile of regional programming is raised because if local people feel short- changed, they can make their views known at two public events a year (when companies unveil their statements and report back on how well they fulfilled them). </p> <p>There are lots of active stockholders out there, a huge raft of people who have a significant int-erest in regional broadcasting. The interesting thing will be the extent to which they become engaged,\" says Thane. \"The aim is to maintain diversity, not an identikit service.\" So, news and current affairs apart, regional slots can be spread over eight to 10 genres, providing sport does not dominate. </p> <p>Channel 4's statement reflects culture secretary Chris Smith's desire to get away from the current negative clause defining it as catering for tastes and interests not readily served by channel three, and to ensure it does its duty as the most public service- oriented of the commercially funded channels, just below the BBC. </p> <p>And Channel 5, Hodgson remarks, \"is absolutely up for this, very much saying, 'We have something to bring to the party.' \" In the run-up to the white paper it hardly participated in the political lobbying, but it subsequently mobilised as the changed ownership decreed more funds and a move towards the mainstream. As for ITV's statement: \"We're impressed. Clarity and realism. What you want from them is a really high commitment to original production. Be realistic, they are popular entertainers; don't let's be snooty about popular drama. The public love it, it's very successful.\" </p> <p>Are the programme statements legally binding? Thane replies: \"That's a very interesting point. In essence, the streamlined licences and diversity commitments underpinning them are legally enforceable. The statements are a voluntary manifestation of that.\" So they need an element of goodwill on the broadcasters' side in order to deliver. The potential danger is that, somewhere down the line, clever lawyers might walk all over them. </p> <p><strong>The 'contracts with viewers'</strong></p> <p><strong>CHANNEL 5</strong></p> <p><strong> General:</strong> Will continue \"to provide a point of difference in style and content from other broadcasters\". </p> <p><strong> News:</strong> Promises a daily hour of news and talk from 5.30pm during the election campaign, with Matthew Wright hosting discussion on the day's developments. </p> <p><strong> Documentaries:</strong> Undertakes to remain energetic, specialising in reactive documentaries and current affairs. </p> <p><strong> Original drama:</strong> To stay at 12 hours per year excluding soaps, with Urban Gothic returning. </p> <p><strong> Entertainment:</strong> Commits to one-hour family entertainment formats: a third year of Night Fever and Fort Boyard, plus a new strand, Desert Forges.

By the end of the next business year, according to the figures, the total advertising revenue for business to business magazines is likely to rise \u00a348m to \u00a31.38bn. This represents a significant decline in the growth seen in 1999-2000 and 2000-2001, when advertising revenue increased 71m from 1.26bn to 1.33bn. The growth predicted over the next year is 3.5%, compared with a rise of 5.3% over the course of the previous year. The research has been compiled in response to predictions that advertising revenues will fall for media companies across the board. The results echo research published in January by market research company AC Nielsen, which predicted advertising growth over the next year of 4%. Since last autumn, the media industry has been seeing growing signs of an impending advertising slowdown. ITV companies Granada and Carlton warned then that their advertising revenue would decline.

A BSkyB spokesman refused to confirm reports of Mr Swingewood's departure, despite speculation that he is to leave BSkyB in the next few days. Mr Swingewood, who was appointed to the post in October 1999, has taken responsibility within the company for a string of disastrous internet investments.

The value of Sports Internet is now said to be as low as \u00a310m. BSkyB's other internet investments included \u00a310m in the recently rescued Letsbuyit.com; \u00a311m in Gameplay, which is currently looking for a buyer; a 6% stake in Sportal, which is also said to be desperate for more funding; around \u00a31.5 in the now defunct Toyzone.co.uk; and almost \u00a31m in Mykindaplace.com.

A spokeswoman for the film's producer's Warner Bros admitted that it is having to take a firm line with it's child stars. \"As a matter of routine, we asked the parents or legal guardians of the children who are working on the set to sign these agreements,\" she said. \"The purpose of them is to stop people discussing various aspects of the film before it's released.\" However, despite the secrecy, a few details from the film have leaked out. Apparently, Harry is a football fan who supports Arsenal and loves fish fingers.</p> <p><a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Name?Cruz,+Pen%E9lope\">Penelope Cruz</a> has dismissed talk that she and co-star Nicolas Cage are an item. \"We are not together as a couple,\" she said in an interview published in Saturday's <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk:80/et?ac=004836328638671&amp;rtmo=r9aXFrFX&amp;atmo=rrrrrrrq&amp;pg=\" et 01 4 21 tlcruz21.html\"\">Daily Telegraph</a> magazine. \"Nicolas and I are very good friends.\" Cage, who very publicly left his actress wife Patricia Arquette while he was on the set of <a href=\"http://film.theguardian.com/Film_Page/0,4061,452379,00.html\">Captain Corelli's Mandolin</a>, had a great sense of humour, Cruz said. \"He really makes me laugh. I grew up watching all of his films.\" The 27-year-old star also dismissed rumours that she was romantically linked with Tom Cruise after pictures were shown in the tabloids of her and Cruise walking arm-in-arm in Central Park. \"You thought those pictures were real?\" Cruz said. \"...they were taken on the set of my new film Vanilla Sky. The Spanish actress said she was looking forward to returning to her \"real home\" in Madrid this summer and revealed she was planning a new project with Spanish director <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Name?Almod%F3var,+Pedro\">Pedro Almodovar</a> and Antonio Banderas. </p> <p>Mormon film-maker <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Name?Dutcher,+Richard\">Richard Dutcher</a>, director and star of last year's God's Army has announced plans to make a movie biography of church founder <a href=\"http://www.mormons.org/daily/history/people/joseph_smith/index.htm\">Joseph Smith</a>. Dutcher has already begun scouting New York and Midwest locations for the tentatively titled The Prophet: The Story of Joseph Smith Jr. \"I want to bring this amazingly charismatic and strong individual to the screen,'' Dutcher told reporters. ''A figure like this is greater than Lawrence of Arabia. This is Gandhi... If I don't make this film, somebody else is going to. And I'm convinced that if they do it, I'm not going to like it.'' The founding father of Mormonism claimed a heavenly being appeared to him in 1823 and showed him a religious history of an ancient American civilisation, which Smith translated, into the Book of Mormon. He died in jail in 1844.</p> <p>A sequel to <a href=\"http://guardian.imdb.com/Title?0099348\">Dances with Wolves</a> has taken a step closer to the big screen after the film rights to the follow-up novel The Holy Road were bought by an American production company, according to <a href=\"\" \"http: www.ananova.com entertainment story sm_269169.html\" target=\"_NEW\">Ananova</a>. The original book about a tribal warrior who goes on a mission to rescue his wife when she is abducted by white invaders, was turned into an Oscar-winning film starring Kevin Costlier in 1990. The book which will take up the story ten years later, is set to be published in September. There is no word yet on whether Costner will be involved in the film.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Some of the young actors in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone have been made to sign contracts promising not to talk about the contents of the film according to Ananova. A spokeswoman for the film's producer's Warner Bros admitted that it is having to take a firm line with it's child stars. \"As a matter of routine, we asked the parents or legal guardians of the children who are working on the set to sign these agreements,\" she said. \"The purpose of them is to stop people discussing various aspects of the film before it's released.\" However, despite the secrecy, a few details from the film have leaked out. Apparently, Harry is a football fan who supports Arsenal and loves fish fingers. Penelope Cruz has dismissed talk that she and co-star Nicolas Cage are an item. \"We are not together as a couple,\" she said in an interview published in Saturday's Daily Telegraph magazine. \"Nicolas and I are very good friends.\" Cage, who very publicly left his actress wife Patricia Arquette while he was on the set of Captain Corelli's Mandolin, had a great sense of humour, Cruz said. \"He really makes me laugh. I grew up watching all of his films.\" The 27-year-old star also dismissed rumours that she was romantically linked with Tom Cruise after pictures were shown in the tabloids of her and Cruise walking arm-in-arm in Central Park. \"You thought those pictures were real?\" Cruz said. \"...they were taken on the set of my new film Vanilla Sky. The Spanish actress said she was looking forward to returning to her \"real home\" in Madrid this summer and revealed she was planning a new project with Spanish director Pedro Almodovar and Antonio Banderas. Mormon film-maker Richard Dutcher, director and star of last year's God's Army has announced plans to make a movie biography of church founder Joseph Smith. Dutcher has already begun scouting New York and Midwest locations for the tentatively titled The Prophet: The Story of Joseph Smith Jr. \"I want to bring this amazingly charismatic and strong individual to the screen,'' Dutcher told reporters. ''A figure like this is greater than Lawrence of Arabia. This is Gandhi... If I don't make this film, somebody else is going to. And I'm convinced that if they do it, I'm not going to like it.'' The founding father of Mormonism claimed a heavenly being appeared to him in 1823 and showed him a religious history of an ancient American civilisation, which Smith translated, into the Book of Mormon. He died in jail in 1844. A sequel to Dances with Wolves has taken a step closer to the big screen after the film rights to the follow-up novel The Holy Road were bought by an American production company, according to Ananova. The original book about a tribal warrior who goes on a mission to rescue his wife when she is abducted by white invaders, was turned into an Oscar-winning film starring Kevin Costlier in 1990. The book which will take up the story ten years later, is set to be published in September. There is no word yet on whether Costner will be involved in the film.",

The group, armed with automatic rifles and shotguns, stormed a luxury hotel overlooking the scenic Bosphorus 12 hours earlier, taking at least 30 people hostage. The action ended after the interior minister, Sadettin Tantan, held talks with the gunmen. No one was injured, according to the police. The gunmen had earlier issued a statement saying that their action was a protest against Russia's \"bloody attacks\" in the Caucasus. They told the police that they had no intention to \"spill blood\" but warned that the action could \"turn into a mess\" if the Turkish authorities intervened. However, it is reported that they had demanded to speak to Mr Tantan. The group is believed to be led by Muhammed Tokcan, a Turkish citizen of Chechen origin, who hijacked a ferry and held more than 200 people hostage in 1996. He was sent to jail after surrendering to police, but released late last year under an amnesty law. Hundreds of police surrounded the hotel.

Manchester United's season is effectively over and they certainly looked ripe for opposing in this local derby. I backed City at 15/2 to win the match.

Put it this way, if I asked you to make me a \u00a320 profit on this game, but you had to accept the risk, which option would you choose?

      "body": "<p>American tourists may not return to Britain after the foot and mouth outbreak for up to four years, the culture secretary, Chris Smith, warned yesterday.</p> <p>As tour operators disclosed that foreign tourism was down by up to 30% over the Easter holidays, Mr Smith said the \"real worry\" was that, after the initial drop in visitor numbers, \"the American market in particular could take a long time to recover\".</p> <p>On GMTV's Sunday programme, he pointed to the \"major fall-off\" in American tourists coming to Britain for several years after the 1991 Gulf war, when many were alarmed at the prospect of terrorist attacks. \"Even though Britain was thousands of miles away, the American tourist perspective was that Europe was not somewhere to go, and that effect lasted for about three or four years\".</p> <p>European tourists were expected to take a far less sensitive approach over returning to Britain on holiday, he indicated.</p> <p>The government also sought to reassure the public last night that burning pyres of animals slaughtered during the foot and mouth epidemic were not causing a health risk. A report by the National Environmental Technology Centre claimed the pyres were emitting higher levels of polluting dioxins than all the country's factories combined.</p> <p>American visitors form the core of the UK's tourism market, being worth \u00a32.5bn annually, but they have proven quick to steer clear over threats such as IRA terrorism or reverberations from the Gulf or Balkan conflicts. Numbers dropped by a quarter in 1991 as a result of the Gulf war.</p> <p>The culture secretary's remarks coincided with a warning from Richard Tobias, chief executive of the British Incoming Tour Operators Association, that the industry - normally worth \u00a313bn a year to Britain's economy - faced serious problems in the run-up to summer.</p> <p>Trade was 25-30% down, he said on GMTV. The next eight weeks would be a crunch period as operators sought to win summer bookings, he warned.</p> <p>Mr Tobias called on Mr Smith to persuade cabinet colleagues, notably the chancellor, Gordon Brown, to release funds to pay for a big publicity campaign to attract overseas visitors.</p> <p>Tourism leaders are furious after Mr Brown had approved only \u00a36m to convince domestic and overseas tourists that Britain was not closed for business.</p> <p>The culture secretary appeared to hint at further cash, acknowledging: \"We have to make sure that we throw as many lifelines as we can to the hard-pressed tourism industry.\"</p> <p>He also made his most forthright attack yet on Conservative-controlled local authorities such as Buckinghamshire which he claimed were refusing to open footpaths to the public \"for ideological reasons\". He said: \"I would appeal to them, because they are affecting the tourism and hotel businesses in their county.\"</p> <p><b>Email update</b><br><a

      "bodyText": "American tourists may not return to Britain after the foot and mouth outbreak for up to four years, the culture secretary, Chris Smith, warned yesterday. As tour operators disclosed that foreign tourism was down by up to 30% over the Easter holidays, Mr Smith said the \"real worry\" was that, after the initial drop in visitor numbers, \"the American market in particular could take a long time to recover\". On GMTV's Sunday programme, he pointed to the \"major fall-off\" in American tourists coming to Britain for several years after the 1991 Gulf war, when many were alarmed at the prospect of terrorist attacks. \"Even though Britain was thousands of miles away, the American tourist perspective was that Europe was not somewhere to go, and that effect lasted for about three or four years\". European tourists were expected to take a far less sensitive approach over returning to Britain on holiday, he indicated. The government also sought to reassure the public last night that burning pyres of animals slaughtered during the foot and mouth epidemic were not causing a health risk. A report by the National Environmental Technology Centre claimed the pyres were emitting higher levels of polluting dioxins than all the country's factories combined. American visitors form the core of the UK's tourism market, being worth \u00a32.5bn annually, but they have proven quick to steer clear over threats such as IRA terrorism or reverberations from the Gulf or Balkan conflicts. Numbers dropped by a quarter in 1991 as a result of the Gulf war. The culture secretary's remarks coincided with a warning from Richard Tobias, chief executive of the British Incoming Tour Operators Association, that the industry - normally worth \u00a313bn a year to Britain's economy - faced serious problems in the run-up to summer. Trade was 25-30% down, he said on GMTV. The next eight weeks would be a crunch period as operators sought to win summer bookings, he warned. Mr Tobias called on Mr Smith to persuade cabinet colleagues, notably the chancellor, Gordon Brown, to release funds to pay for a big publicity campaign to attract overseas visitors. Tourism leaders are furious after Mr Brown had approved only \u00a36m to convince domestic and overseas tourists that Britain was not closed for business. The culture secretary appeared to hint at further cash, acknowledging: \"We have to make sure that we throw as many lifelines as we can to the hard-pressed tourism industry.\" He also made his most forthright attack yet on Conservative-controlled local authorities such as Buckinghamshire which he claimed were refusing to open footpaths to the public \"for ideological reasons\". He said: \"I would appeal to them, because they are affecting the tourism and hotel businesses in their county.\" Email update Sign up for our free daily foot and mouth round-up What's going on?

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>If you are unhappy in your work, you are not alone. Job satisfaction among Britain's 6 million public sector workers has plummeted over the past decade - and stress is to blame, says a new study from Warwick University. </p> <p>The study by Andrew Oswald and Jonathan Gardner found that an increase in depression, strain, sleep loss and unhappiness during the 1990s had made employment in the public sector more pressurised and less enjoyable. </p> <p>However, despite the discontent, most people in the public sector are almost completely satisfied with their job. On a scale of one (completely dissatisfied) to seven (completely satisfied), 41 per cent of the population gave their answer as six and 18 per cent went for 7. Only 2 per cent answered one. </p> <p>The sample of 5,000 workers from both the public and private sector was re-interviewed each year through the 1990s, with stress levels assessed by the answers to 12 questions used to measure mental distress and psychological ill health such as 'Can you concentrate on your work?', and 'Are you losing confidence?'. </p> <p>While public-sector workers began the 1990s with far higher levels of job satisfaction than those in the private sector, the research showed that this gap had been virtually eroded by 1998, a year of tightly controlled government spending. </p> <p>Rising stress due to a substantial increase in workload had caused the decline in job satisfaction, Oswald says. The workers, which include doctors, teachers, lecturers and civil servants, now have to face extra bureaucracy, pressure to meet targets and the introduction of working practices from the private sector. The latter was more stressful than in 1990, but not much. </p> <p>As well as an increasingly heavy workload, public-sector workers have been subjected to much evaluation, inspection and public humiliation. Oswald says: 'Public humiliation is not found in any other job. Who, apart from teachers and doctors, gets their name published all over the papers saying they are second rate?' </p> <p>This process of holding people to account has made the public sector very unpleasant to work in because human beings are not equipped to cope with it, according to Oswald. </p> <p>All groups of public-sector workers have become less satisfied at work over the past decade. But the slump in satisfaction was particularly evident in the NHS, higher education, and among those working for local government. 'Local government has been the poor relation of the public sector,' says Unison, the union that represents public-sector workers. It says the worst affected are those at the lower end of the pay scale in local government, such as cleaners and caterers. </p> <p>Unison does not find the report's conclusions surprising. It says low morale is the result of years of under-investment, both in staff and the workplace. 'The lack of pay awards and training have lead to loss of job satisfaction,' says a spokeswoman. 'Managing on a day-to-day level is stressful after years of cutbacks.' </p> <p>It also blames the threat of violence and the effects of privatisation for the poor morale. 'When a service is privatised employees are guaranteed work - at first. The prospect of restructuring hangs over them.' </p> <p>Can anything be done to turn round this unsatisfactory state of affairs? </p> <p>It has become a matter for public policy, Oswald believes. 'As a nation we have to decide how important our public services are to us. We have to offer good jobs or hand them over to the private sector. At the moment we are not in equilibrium.' </p> <p>Unison believes services should be run in-house. 'We are against privatisation and contracting out.' </p> <p>Decent pay awards and further investment are also needed to remedy the situation. A spokeswoman says: 'In the health service the amount of money that has gone in has made a difference. Investment has been at all levels. Individual learning accounts are available to all staff. They have recognised that staff at all levels are important.' </p> <p>Bad management practices also need to be eliminated, Unison says. </p> <p>The Cabinet Office thinks the civil service reform programme, launched in 1999, is helping. A spokeswoman says: 'There may be issues of motivation and stress in the public sector due to the pace of change. But our own research indicates we are investing in the right kind of personnel policies such as a family friendly environment and training.' </p> <p>But Oswald is not convinced that anything is about to change. He says: 'We expect these trends to continue. I think this is very serious for Britain.' </p> <p>Other findings of the research were that job satisfaction was u-shaped in age, with initial contentment at work during teenage years disappearing by the age of 25. Job satisfaction was discovered to be lowest when people were in their 20s and 30s and highest among staff in their 50s and 60s. </p> <p>Oswald explains: 'It is a process of adaptation. Young people just finishing university have very high expectations then they go through a very painful period which involves coming to terms with their limitations. Once they have gone through this they are happy in their work again.' This pattern is true for all types of occupations and among all nationalities. 'It is something very deep in human nature,' Oswald says. 'It is nothing to do with balancing work and home commitments as some people have reported.' </p> <p>The theory also explains why Britons with university degrees report the lowest levels of satisfaction at work. Workers with no qualifications are the happiest, the study found. </p> <p>Job satisfaction was found to be higher among women than among men, lower among blacks than whites, slightly lower in union workplaces than non-union ones, high in small workplaces, and highest of all in not-for-profit organisations. </p> <p>Women were more satisfied no matter where they came from. Oswald says two theories have been proposed to explain this. One is that women have low expectations and are more pleased with any level of achievement. The second is that they knuckle down more than men - they throw themselves into work rather than worry about external factors such as hierarchy and advancing their own status. </p> <p>So be nice next time you have to deal with a man working in the public sector.</p>",

      "bodyText": "If you are unhappy in your work, you are not alone. Job satisfaction among Britain's 6 million public sector workers has plummeted over the past decade - and stress is to blame, says a new study from Warwick University. The study by Andrew Oswald and Jonathan Gardner found that an increase in depression, strain, sleep loss and unhappiness during the 1990s had made employment in the public sector more pressurised and less enjoyable. However, despite the discontent, most people in the public sector are almost completely satisfied with their job. On a scale of one (completely dissatisfied) to seven (completely satisfied), 41 per cent of the population gave their answer as six and 18 per cent went for 7. Only 2 per cent answered one. The sample of 5,000 workers from both the public and private sector was re-interviewed each year through the 1990s, with stress levels assessed by the answers to 12 questions used to measure mental distress and psychological ill health such as 'Can you concentrate on your work?', and 'Are you losing confidence?'. While public-sector workers began the 1990s with far higher levels of job satisfaction than those in the private sector, the research showed that this gap had been virtually eroded by 1998, a year of tightly controlled government spending. Rising stress due to a substantial increase in workload had caused the decline in job satisfaction, Oswald says. The workers, which include doctors, teachers, lecturers and civil servants, now have to face extra bureaucracy, pressure to meet targets and the introduction of working practices from the private sector. The latter was more stressful than in 1990, but not much. As well as an increasingly heavy workload, public-sector workers have been subjected to much evaluation, inspection and public humiliation. Oswald says: 'Public humiliation is not found in any other job. Who, apart from teachers and doctors, gets their name published all over the papers saying they are second rate?' This process of holding people to account has made the public sector very unpleasant to work in because human beings are not equipped to cope with it, according to Oswald. All groups of public-sector workers have become less satisfied at work over the past decade. But the slump in satisfaction was particularly evident in the NHS, higher education, and among those working for local government. 'Local government has been the poor relation of the public sector,' says Unison, the union that represents public-sector workers. It says the worst affected are those at the lower end of the pay scale in local government, such as cleaners and caterers. Unison does not find the report's conclusions surprising. It says low morale is the result of years of under-investment, both in staff and the workplace. 'The lack of pay awards and training have lead to loss of job satisfaction,' says a spokeswoman. 'Managing on a day-to-day level is stressful after years of cutbacks.' It also blames the threat of violence and the effects of privatisation for the poor morale. 'When a service is privatised employees are guaranteed work - at first. The prospect of restructuring hangs over them.' Can anything be done to turn round this unsatisfactory state of affairs? It has become a matter for public policy, Oswald believes. 'As a nation we have to decide how important our public services are to us. We have to offer good jobs or hand them over to the private sector. At the moment we are not in equilibrium.' Unison believes services should be run in-house. 'We are against privatisation and contracting out.' Decent pay awards and further investment are also needed to remedy the situation. A spokeswoman says: 'In the health service the amount of money that has gone in has made a difference. Investment has been at all levels. Individual learning accounts are available to all staff. They have recognised that staff at all levels are important.' Bad management practices also need to be eliminated, Unison says. The Cabinet Office thinks the civil service reform programme, launched in 1999, is helping. A spokeswoman says: 'There may be issues of motivation and stress in the public sector due to the pace of change. But our own research indicates we are investing in the right kind of personnel policies such as a family friendly environment and training.' But Oswald is not convinced that anything is about to change. He says: 'We expect these trends to continue. I think this is very serious for Britain.' Other findings of the research were that job satisfaction was u-shaped in age, with initial contentment at work during teenage years disappearing by the age of 25. Job satisfaction was discovered to be lowest when people were in their 20s and 30s and highest among staff in their 50s and 60s. Oswald explains: 'It is a process of adaptation. Young people just finishing university have very high expectations then they go through a very painful period which involves coming to terms with their limitations. Once they have gone through this they are happy in their work again.' This pattern is true for all types of occupations and among all nationalities. 'It is something very deep in human nature,' Oswald says. 'It is nothing to do with balancing work and home commitments as some people have reported.' The theory also explains why Britons with university degrees report the lowest levels of satisfaction at work. Workers with no qualifications are the happiest, the study found. Job satisfaction was found to be higher among women than among men, lower among blacks than whites, slightly lower in union workplaces than non-union ones, high in small workplaces, and highest of all in not-for-profit organisations. Women were more satisfied no matter where they came from. Oswald says two theories have been proposed to explain this. One is that women have low expectations and are more pleased with any level of achievement. The second is that they knuckle down more than men - they throw themselves into work rather than worry about external factors such as hierarchy and advancing their own status. So be nice next time you have to deal with a man working in the public sector.",

      "body": "<p>Early in the morning, late in the shift, platform three. It is 8:30am at Victoria. The busiest time, on the busiest platform, in the busiest station on the London Underground. Chris Boyce sits in front of eight monitors and the station concourse, guiding the human traffic like a conductor before an enormous and unruly orchestra. The cleaning service has been contracted out, and only one of the three cleaners who should be there has turned up. Oxford Circus is closed due to a security alert and the Central Line is not functioning between Marble Arch and Liverpool Street. And the number of passengers on platform three is getting perilously close to unsafe.</p> <p>The tube is in trouble. Not just this morning but every morning. The capital's most vital artery is both clogged by passengers and starved of the oxygen of investment. \"The most important thing about the evolution of the subway as a symbol,\" writes Michael Brooks in Subway City, \"is that it starts by expressing faith in the city's future and, once built, quickly becomes a handy rhetorical tool for expressing discontent with its present.\"</p> <p>There are few places where this is truer than London. On its opening day, in 1863, \"the crowd at the Farringdon Street station was as great as at the doors of a theatre on the first night of some popular performer\", according to one observer. A few years later, Henry Mayhew overheard one workman say: \"Just think of what these here trains save you at night after your work's over. If a man gets home tired after his day's labour he is inclined to be quarrelsome.\" While if he gets a ride home, and has a good rest \"he is as pleasant a fellow again over his supper\".</p> <p>Today, as it ferries 1bn passengers around the capital every year, the tube is as liable to make a commuter quarrelsome as his work. It is a byword for underinvestment, overpopulation, industrial strife and political squabbling. In June, Ken Livingstone, the London mayor, will take the government to court over its plans to privately finance the underground. Next month, on May 3, on the day Tony Blair planned to call the election, tube workers will strike over safety and job security. The last time there was an industrial action, just over a month ago, the capital became one huge car park; paralysed as traffic that normally dawdles simply stood still. Journeys that would usually take 20 minutes were lasting two hours or more.</p> <p>During his mayoral campaign, Livingstone once said that he would wake up in the middle of the night thinking of how the tube might be better run. It was a testament to his commitment to the city. Whatever you thought about his views on Irish politics or global capitalism, here was a man who was dedicated to London. And there was no greater, costlier or more cumbersome signifier for the city than the tube. At one stage, the battle for the mayor became a referendum on how the underground should be funded. But what started as a local transport matter has grown into a national issue - the first serious test both to the limits and possibilities of devolution and to Blair's Third Way. Commuters are also voters and none of the three main parties came close to Livingstone, who made his plans for the underground the centrepiece of his campaign. More than a dozen of Labour's most marginal seats are in constituencies where people often use the tube. Now Livingstone is not the only one for whom the tube is giving sleepless nights.</p> <p>Back at platform three, Boyce is tackling a familiar problem. The Victoria Line northbound is a focal point for commuters from Sussex and suburban Kent who are on the way to the centre of town. Commuters, by their nature, are creatures of habit. They get to the station, come down the escalators, and wait for the train at the spot which will drop them at the most convenient place at the other end. Unfortunately, for all concerned, this means there is a huge bottleneck at one end of the platform. The other end, as the adjacent monitor indicates, is completely empty.</p> <p>But as each individual ignores the request to move up the platform, the collective result is that a dangerous mass of bodies is crammed into one place. To avoid an accident the station assistants stop letting people through the barriers. Now there is a bottleneck in the concourse. Anxious people in three-quarter-length coats are fuming. The concourse fills up. Back at the platform the trains keep coming, but it will take several more before it is safe to let more people down. Meanwhile, the concourse fills up.</p> <p>Boyce orders the entrance to the station to be closed off. \"You don't like having to do it, particularly in winter when it's raining,\" he says. \"But you have to for safety reasons. You can build the story backwards. It starts on the platform and ends up outside.\" With platform three clearing he gives the order to start letting them through again. \"There's never a bottleneck for long. These people are late so they'll run down the escalator and it will all start again in 15 minutes,\" he says. On platform two, the westbound District and Circle Line, someone has pulled the passenger emergency chord. The signs that used to warn of a \u00a3100 fine for improper use have been removed now because of concern that people in genuine need might be deterred from signalling their distress because of the cost. A woman has fainted, and has been led off the train and assisted.</p> <p>An abandoned duffel coat, masquerading as a potential security risk, has been found, kicked and cleared. It belonged to a tout - one of the men who try to sell tickets they have found to other passengers. \"It's a shame he wasn't in it,\" says one of Boyce's colleagues. Back on platform three the bottlenecks have returned. Different faces etched with the same, time-starved angst held up by the same problem.</p> <p>\"I'll tell you the biggest change,\" says one manager who has worked on the tube for more than 30 years. \"It's not so much the technology, although that is different. It's the people. They want to be everywhere yesterday. I don't ever remember people being in as much of a rush as they are nowadays. We have to provide the best service we can. But sometimes you want to say to them: 'It wasn't us who left the bag there.'\"</p> <p>Thanks to Britpop, Britart and Blair, in the latter part of the past decade London gained the adjective \"swinging\". For those who live there seething, straining or struggling would seem more appropriate. The pace of change is scarcely sustainable. London's population will grow 9.4% by 2021, far faster than anywhere else in the country. In 20 years there will be 7.71m in the capital - more than the current populations of Ireland, Latvia and Estonia combined, crammed into less than one hundredth of the space. \"[London] is no longer simply the nation's capital, but now almost an international city-state,\" said a report by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation last year. Yet this massive and chaotic growth has, for the past 15 years, coincided with the absence of any democratic authority to develop or coordinate it. Since the abolition of the Greater London Council, London has literally been out of control. And one of the principal casualties has been the tube. On that much, probably, both Livingstone and the government can agree. Near Euston station a team of men staring at a wall full of grids are making sure the Victoria and Northern lines keep running smoothly. Sitting in a semi-circle monitoring traffic flows with the help of numbers and symbols the staff could be on the starship Enterprise. But the equipment they are using looks like it was rented from the Doctor Who archive of Jon Pertwee's era. \"We are still working with 60s technology,\" says Peter Neal, services manager. \"Everything you see around you where technology is concerned has been here since we started operating from this room. If you buy a car then you replace it every 10 years. At least. But train systems have to last for a lot longer.\"</p> <p>The thorny issue is how to raise the money to set it right. The government favours a public-private partnership (PPP) whereby private companies operate the tunnels, tracks, signals and stations while the trains would remain in public control. Livingstone supports a fully publicly funded service, where the money is raised through bonds.</p> <p>His overwhelming victory at the polls suggested that Livingstone had persuaded Londoners. With privatised railways fulfilling their political destiny as the poll tax on wheels, the Thatcherite orthodoxy that the private sector inevitably provides cheaper, better services than the state was in abeyance. But Livingstone could not convince the government. New Labour, it seemed, had attached itself to a dogma just as it was going out of fashion.</p> <p>Livingstone vowed not to give up. He enlisted Bob Kiley, a former CIA agent, with an impressive reputation for turning around ailing underground infrastructures in America. He had done it in Boston during the 70s and then again in New York during the 80s. On paper, the socialist and the ex-spy made unlikely bedfellows. \"I can't believe that I am trying to recruit a CIA agent,\" were Livingstone's first words to Kiley.</p> <p>\"Well, I find it hard to believe that I'm going to work for an unreconstructed Marxist,\" replied Kiley. The first tube ride Kiley took on his arrival saw him stuck in a tunnel on the Circle Line for 11 minutes. In practice their different world outlooks have caused problems. Livingstone supported the last strike. Kiley did not. \"I told Ken that this strike was self-defeating,\" he said.</p> <p>But the two things they did agree on was their support for public funding and opposition to PPP: \"It has no basis in reality or common sense,\" says Kiley. Months of negotiations lead nowhere. If public opinion could have decided the outcome, Livingstone would have won. So skilful has his campaign been that the government has made the rare admission that even it has been outspun. \"We took the view that through all the negotiations we would play a straight bat, not try and play to the gallery,\" said Prescott. \"We are behind in the propaganda stakes but our argument is sound.\"</p> <p>When months of negotiations collapsed and the government decided to push ahead with PPP, Livingstone decided to take it to court, claiming that the government had usurped his constitutional right to control transport policy and that its decisions will endanger lives. Mr Justice Sullivan said he was satisfied that the mayor's statutory powers were \"novel, complex and untested in the courts\" and that the issue was \"of vital importance to Londoners generally\".</p> <p>Rattling around in the darkness, the promise of light in the cab of a tube driver is made long in advance. The next platform announces itself initially in a small shaft. Its growth is gradual, but little can prepare you for the glare of your arrival, where blank faces are waiting - a blur of people looking up from their books and newspapers. They have been waiting for you. Physical geography is meaningless here. You are travelling hundreds of miles a day and yet the city looks the same - long monotonous stretches of penumbra followed by short bursts of fluorescent yellow. Only through human geography can you map your way through time and place. Suits in the morning, tourists at lunchtime, schoolkids in the afternoon, impatient before 9am, rowdy after 9pm, blacker in the south and north, browner to the east. You are both in and out of control. Gliding through the city's underbelly, ferrying your human cargo to and from work, you are all-powerful. But on the Victoria Line at least, almost everything is operated electronically. With shifts lasting eight hours a day there is little to stimulate the mind. \"Boredom is a big problem,\" says Jan Mowbray who works on the Victoria Line. \"There's not much to do and it's dark all day. In the winter you leave home in the dark, work in the dark and then go home in the dark. In the summer it's really lovely and sunny outside and bloody dark in here. You can't win.\" And then she closes the doors and glides away. Through tunnels that offer occasional glimpses of light, but to which there is apparently no end.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Early in the morning, late in the shift, platform three. It is 8:30am at Victoria. The busiest time, on the busiest platform, in the busiest station on the London Underground. Chris Boyce sits in front of eight monitors and the station concourse, guiding the human traffic like a conductor before an enormous and unruly orchestra. The cleaning service has been contracted out, and only one of the three cleaners who should be there has turned up. Oxford Circus is closed due to a security alert and the Central Line is not functioning between Marble Arch and Liverpool Street. And the number of passengers on platform three is getting perilously close to unsafe. The tube is in trouble. Not just this morning but every morning. The capital's most vital artery is both clogged by passengers and starved of the oxygen of investment. \"The most important thing about the evolution of the subway as a symbol,\" writes Michael Brooks in Subway City, \"is that it starts by expressing faith in the city's future and, once built, quickly becomes a handy rhetorical tool for expressing discontent with its present.\" There are few places where this is truer than London. On its opening day, in 1863, \"the crowd at the Farringdon Street station was as great as at the doors of a theatre on the first night of some popular performer\", according to one observer. A few years later, Henry Mayhew overheard one workman say: \"Just think of what these here trains save you at night after your work's over. If a man gets home tired after his day's labour he is inclined to be quarrelsome.\" While if he gets a ride home, and has a good rest \"he is as pleasant a fellow again over his supper\". Today, as it ferries 1bn passengers around the capital every year, the tube is as liable to make a commuter quarrelsome as his work. It is a byword for underinvestment, overpopulation, industrial strife and political squabbling. In June, Ken Livingstone, the London mayor, will take the government to court over its plans to privately finance the underground. Next month, on May 3, on the day Tony Blair planned to call the election, tube workers will strike over safety and job security. The last time there was an industrial action, just over a month ago, the capital became one huge car park; paralysed as traffic that normally dawdles simply stood still. Journeys that would usually take 20 minutes were lasting two hours or more. During his mayoral campaign, Livingstone once said that he would wake up in the middle of the night thinking of how the tube might be better run. It was a testament to his commitment to the city. Whatever you thought about his views on Irish politics or global capitalism, here was a man who was dedicated to London. And there was no greater, costlier or more cumbersome signifier for the city than the tube. At one stage, the battle for the mayor became a referendum on how the underground should be funded. But what started as a local transport matter has grown into a national issue - the first serious test both to the limits and possibilities of devolution and to Blair's Third Way. Commuters are also voters and none of the three main parties came close to Livingstone, who made his plans for the underground the centrepiece of his campaign. More than a dozen of Labour's most marginal seats are in constituencies where people often use the tube. Now Livingstone is not the only one for whom the tube is giving sleepless nights. Back at platform three, Boyce is tackling a familiar problem. The Victoria Line northbound is a focal point for commuters from Sussex and suburban Kent who are on the way to the centre of town. Commuters, by their nature, are creatures of habit. They get to the station, come down the escalators, and wait for the train at the spot which will drop them at the most convenient place at the other end. Unfortunately, for all concerned, this means there is a huge bottleneck at one end of the platform. The other end, as the adjacent monitor indicates, is completely empty. But as each individual ignores the request to move up the platform, the collective result is that a dangerous mass of bodies is crammed into one place. To avoid an accident the station assistants stop letting people through the barriers. Now there is a bottleneck in the concourse. Anxious people in three-quarter-length coats are fuming. The concourse fills up. Back at the platform the trains keep coming, but it will take several more before it is safe to let more people down. Meanwhile, the concourse fills up. Boyce orders the entrance to the station to be closed off. \"You don't like having to do it, particularly in winter when it's raining,\" he says. \"But you have to for safety reasons. You can build the story backwards. It starts on the platform and ends up outside.\" With platform three clearing he gives the order to start letting them through again. \"There's never a bottleneck for long. These people are late so they'll run down the escalator and it will all start again in 15 minutes,\" he says. On platform two, the westbound District and Circle Line, someone has pulled the passenger emergency chord. The signs that used to warn of a \u00a3100 fine for improper use have been removed now because of concern that people in genuine need might be deterred from signalling their distress because of the cost. A woman has fainted, and has been led off the train and assisted. An abandoned duffel coat, masquerading as a potential security risk, has been found, kicked and cleared. It belonged to a tout - one of the men who try to sell tickets they have found to other passengers. \"It's a shame he wasn't in it,\" says one of Boyce's colleagues. Back on platform three the bottlenecks have returned. Different faces etched with the same, time-starved angst held up by the same problem. \"I'll tell you the biggest change,\" says one manager who has worked on the tube for more than 30 years. \"It's not so much the technology, although that is different. It's the people. They want to be everywhere yesterday. I don't ever remember people being in as much of a rush as they are nowadays. We have to provide the best service we can. But sometimes you want to say to them: 'It wasn't us who left the bag there.'\" Thanks to Britpop, Britart and Blair, in the latter part of the past decade London gained the adjective \"swinging\". For those who live there seething, straining or struggling would seem more appropriate. The pace of change is scarcely sustainable. London's population will grow 9.4% by 2021, far faster than anywhere else in the country. In 20 years there will be 7.71m in the capital - more than the current populations of Ireland, Latvia and Estonia combined, crammed into less than one hundredth of the space. \"[London] is no longer simply the nation's capital, but now almost an international city-state,\" said a report by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation last year. Yet this massive and chaotic growth has, for the past 15 years, coincided with the absence of any democratic authority to develop or coordinate it. Since the abolition of the Greater London Council, London has literally been out of control. And one of the principal casualties has been the tube. On that much, probably, both Livingstone and the government can agree. Near Euston station a team of men staring at a wall full of grids are making sure the Victoria and Northern lines keep running smoothly. Sitting in a semi-circle monitoring traffic flows with the help of numbers and symbols the staff could be on the starship Enterprise. But the equipment they are using looks like it was rented from the Doctor Who archive of Jon Pertwee's era. \"We are still working with 60s technology,\" says Peter Neal, services manager. \"Everything you see around you where technology is concerned has been here since we started operating from this room. If you buy a car then you replace it every 10 years. At least. But train systems have to last for a lot longer.\" The thorny issue is how to raise the money to set it right. The government favours a public-private partnership (PPP) whereby private companies operate the tunnels, tracks, signals and stations while the trains would remain in public control. Livingstone supports a fully publicly funded service, where the money is raised through bonds. His overwhelming victory at the polls suggested that Livingstone had persuaded Londoners. With privatised railways fulfilling their political destiny as the poll tax on wheels, the Thatcherite orthodoxy that the private sector inevitably provides cheaper, better services than the state was in abeyance. But Livingstone could not convince the government. New Labour, it seemed, had attached itself to a dogma just as it was going out of fashion. Livingstone vowed not to give up. He enlisted Bob Kiley, a former CIA agent, with an impressive reputation for turning around ailing underground infrastructures in America. He had done it in Boston during the 70s and then again in New York during the 80s. On paper, the socialist and the ex-spy made unlikely bedfellows. \"I can't believe that I am trying to recruit a CIA agent,\" were Livingstone's first words to Kiley. \"Well, I find it hard to believe that I'm going to work for an unreconstructed Marxist,\" replied Kiley. The first tube ride Kiley took on his arrival saw him stuck in a tunnel on the Circle Line for 11 minutes. In practice their different world outlooks have caused problems. Livingstone supported the last strike. Kiley did not. \"I told Ken that this strike was self-defeating,\" he said. But the two things they did agree on was their support for public funding and opposition to PPP: \"It has no basis in reality or common sense,\" says Kiley. Months of negotiations lead nowhere. If public opinion could have decided the outcome, Livingstone would have won. So skilful has his campaign been that the government has made the rare admission that even it has been outspun. \"We took the view that through all the negotiations we would play a straight bat, not try and play to the gallery,\" said Prescott. \"We are behind in the propaganda stakes but our argument is sound.\" When months of negotiations collapsed and the government decided to push ahead with PPP, Livingstone decided to take it to court, claiming that the government had usurped his constitutional right to control transport policy and that its decisions will endanger lives. Mr Justice Sullivan said he was satisfied that the mayor's statutory powers were \"novel, complex and untested in the courts\" and that the issue was \"of vital importance to Londoners generally\". Rattling around in the darkness, the promise of light in the cab of a tube driver is made long in advance. The next platform announces itself initially in a small shaft. Its growth is gradual, but little can prepare you for the glare of your arrival, where blank faces are waiting - a blur of people looking up from their books and newspapers. They have been waiting for you. Physical geography is meaningless here. You are travelling hundreds of miles a day and yet the city looks the same - long monotonous stretches of penumbra followed by short bursts of fluorescent yellow. Only through human geography can you map your way through time and place. Suits in the morning, tourists at lunchtime, schoolkids in the afternoon, impatient before 9am, rowdy after 9pm, blacker in the south and north, browner to the east. You are both in and out of control. Gliding through the city's underbelly, ferrying your human cargo to and from work, you are all-powerful. But on the Victoria Line at least, almost everything is operated electronically. With shifts lasting eight hours a day there is little to stimulate the mind. \"Boredom is a big problem,\" says Jan Mowbray who works on the Victoria Line. \"There's not much to do and it's dark all day. In the winter you leave home in the dark, work in the dark and then go home in the dark. In the summer it's really lovely and sunny outside and bloody dark in here. You can't win.\" And then she closes the doors and glides away. Through tunnels that offer occasional glimpses of light, but to which there is apparently no end.",

      "bodyText": "Despite an \"over-weight\" leading lady, copious cigarette smoking and vast alcohol consumption, word of mouth and warm reviews have pushed Bridget Jones's Diary to the top of the American box office chart. The Working Title film starring Renee Zellweger as the neurotic, 30-something singleton, opened at number three last weekend in the US (see earlier story) but during it's second week of release, took an estimated $10.5m, pushing the family-friendly Spy Kids starring Antonio Banderes from the number one slot. The film, which also stars Hugh Grant and Colin Firth, has now taken an estimated $25.6m. According to research into US cinema-going habits, it seems that American women are so enamoured with the adaptation of the Helen Fielding book they are making return trips to see the film with girlfriends and even men in tow. Meanwhile, there was less joy for Paul Hogan's return as the native outbacker from Down Under in the much-hyped Crocodile Dundee In Los Angeles. The first 'croc' film in 13 years, only managed to take an estimated $8m, slipping into fourth place behind Spy Kids and the Morgan Freeman thriller Along Came A Spider. Freddy Got Fingered, comedian Tom Green's gross-out comedy, opened in the number five slot, taking a disappointing $7.2m. In Britain, the Bridget bandwagon continues to be hugely successfully. The film has taken an estimated $22m (\u00a315m) in the 10 days since it opened.",

      "bodyText": "A director who was at the centre of a television documentary fakery row three years ago picked up a Bafta award last night for his latest work, a drama. Channel 4 was forced into a public apology in 1998 after the Mirror revealed that scenes in Dominic Savage's Cutting Edge documentary, Rogue Males, were faked. But last night at the 2001 Bafta Television Craft Awards Mr Savage completed his rehabilitation by picking up the prize for best new director of fiction for the BBC2 drama, Nice Girl. He beat off competition from Caroline Aherne, nominated for her work on the Royle Family, and Chris Morris, for Jam. Ms Aherne, who recently revealed she would be concentrating on behind-the-camera work to avoid the paparazzi attention that goes with acting, did not attend the awards ceremony. Nice Girl told the story of a pregnant Welsh teenager whose husband leaves her for her sister. Mr Savage developed an improvised script after interviewing 40 people who had been through similar experiences. The programme was co-funded by the BBC's drama and documentary departments and used a cast of relative unknowns. Mr Savage first hit the headlines in February 1998 when Rogue Males was exposed after faking scenes involving cowboy builders, carpet fitters and aggrieved customers. The Channel 4 drama, Longitude, was the other big winner at last night's Bafta ceremony, picking up three craft awards. The Granada Television production triumphed in the production design category, original TV music and photography and lighting for a fiction or entertainment show BBC2 picked up seven of the 14 Bafta craft awards, including Mr Savage's prize. Winners from the channel included League of Gentlemen for best costume design; Sarah MacDonald, who won best new director of factual for her work on the Newsnight child abuse special, A Family Affair; and Ed McCardie, who won the new writer's award for Tinsel Town.

      "body": "<p>The Summit of the Americas ended yesterday in Quebec City, with 34 world leaders from North and South America promising that only democracies are welcome in the new hemispheric trade deal now being negotiated.</p> <p>The controversial meeting, which the Canadian prime minister, Jean Chr\u00e9tien, called a success, saw the leaders doing their best to appear to be responsive to the concerns raised by thousands of protesters.</p> <p>Activists argued the potential trade deal undermines democratic principles and poses a threat to environmental protection and social programmes and denounced the leader's final communiqu\u00e9 as a sham.</p> <p>That much was expected. But the summit also saw an evolution in the dance between protestors and police that has come to dominate international trade meetings since riots brought an end to World Trade Organisation talks in 1999 in Seattle. Both sides showed a little restraint.</p> <p>Not that Quebec City was pretty. Police used tear gas, water cannon and rubber bullets to keep protesters at bay and more than 400 people were arrested. Human rights observers say police used excessive force in many of those cases. Some demonstrators broke windows, started fires and threw Molotov cocktails. But it could have been much worse.</p> <p>Perhaps the most dramatic encounters between police and protesters happened on Friday afternoon, when about 200 demonstrators in black masks stormed the 10ft high security fence. The fence was supposed to keep a crowd of thousands away from negotiations of a new hemispheric free trade zone that would stretch from the Arctic to the tip of South America.</p> <p>But it didn't stand in the way of the \"Black Bloc\", believed to be anarchists, who despite the concrete reinforcements knocked a section of the chain-link fence to the ground. Suddenly, there was a way in, but the majority of protesters, who had insisted that they had come in peace, hung back instead of surging through the opening and following the lead of the black-masked protesters who attacked the police with concrete and sawn off hockey sticks.</p> <p>Most protesters made no attempt to get by the line of police. Violence at previous talks in Seattle and in Windsor, in Canada, left no doubt there would be violence again in Quebec City. There had been meetings in advance to discuss tactics and many protesters had thought about what they would do if they found themselves in an ugly situation.</p> <p>Unlike in Seattle, the police in Quebec City also showed restraint, and for the most part were not caught on camera provoking protesters into violence. There was very little footage and few reports of protestors been tackled or bloodied by police during their arrests as there was in Seattle.</p> <p>Instead, Canadians saw police largely defending the three-mile-long fence the Canadian government raised to protect the US president, George W Bush, and other leaders, rather than going on the attack. \"We have a measured approach in dealing with these situations,\" said Royal Canadian mounted police spokesman Mike Gaudet.</p> <p>The postmortem is yet to come, but the Summit of the Americas was not the disaster for police, protesters, property owners or the politicians that it could have been. But a new trade deal is still years away, 2005 at the earliest, and there will be many more meetings to come.</p> <p><b>Email</b><br> <a href=\"mailto:amcilroy@globeandmail.ca\">amcilroy@globeandmail.ca</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/globalisation/story/0,7369,476923,00.html\">23.04.2001: Quebec rioters cry foul, but free trade deal is done</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4173545,00.html\">21.04.2001: Bush arrives for summit debut</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4173446,00.html\">21.04.2001, leader: New battle of Quebec</a></p> <p><b>Other articles</b><br><a href=\"http://www.searchunlimited.co.uk/search97cgi/s97networkr_cgi?QueryText=%28anne+mcilroy%29AND+%28VdkPublicationDate+%3E%3D+01%2DSep%2D1998%29&amp;ResultColSize=2000&amp;ResultTemplate=ArchiveFull%2Ehts&amp;Collection=archive&amp;SortSpec=score+Desc&amp;Query=anne+mcilroy&amp;ResultStart=1&amp;ResultCount=10&amp;ResultMaxDocs=1000&amp;Dtv= \">More articles by Anne McIlroy</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.summit-americas.org/eng/quebecsummit.htm\" target=\"_new\">Summit of the Americas</a><br><a href=\"http://www.indymedia.org/ftaa/\" target=\"_new\">Independent Media Centre Summit of the Americas coverage site</a><br><a href=\" http://www.stopftaa.org/\" target=\"_new\">Stop the FTAA</a><br></p>",

The controversial meeting, which the Canadian prime minister, Jean Chr\u00e9tien, called a success, saw the leaders doing their best to appear to be responsive to the concerns raised by thousands of protesters. Activists argued the potential trade deal undermines democratic principles and poses a threat to environmental protection and social programmes and denounced the leader's final communiqu\u00e9 as a sham. That much was expected. But the summit also saw an evolution in the dance between protestors and police that has come to dominate international trade meetings since riots brought an end to World Trade Organisation talks in 1999 in Seattle. Both sides showed a little restraint. Not that Quebec City was pretty. Police used tear gas, water cannon and rubber bullets to keep protesters at bay and more than 400 people were arrested. Human rights observers say police used excessive force in many of those cases. Some demonstrators broke windows, started fires and threw Molotov cocktails. But it could have been much worse. Perhaps the most dramatic encounters between police and protesters happened on Friday afternoon, when about 200 demonstrators in black masks stormed the 10ft high security fence. The fence was supposed to keep a crowd of thousands away from negotiations of a new hemispheric free trade zone that would stretch from the Arctic to the tip of South America. But it didn't stand in the way of the \"Black Bloc\", believed to be anarchists, who despite the concrete reinforcements knocked a section of the chain-link fence to the ground. Suddenly, there was a way in, but the majority of protesters, who had insisted that they had come in peace, hung back instead of surging through the opening and following the lead of the black-masked protesters who attacked the police with concrete and sawn off hockey sticks. Most protesters made no attempt to get by the line of police. Violence at previous talks in Seattle and in Windsor, in Canada, left no doubt there would be violence again in Quebec City. There had been meetings in advance to discuss tactics and many protesters had thought about what they would do if they found themselves in an ugly situation. Unlike in Seattle, the police in Quebec City also showed restraint, and for the most part were not caught on camera provoking protesters into violence. There was very little footage and few reports of protestors been tackled or bloodied by police during their arrests as there was in Seattle. Instead, Canadians saw police largely defending the three-mile-long fence the Canadian government raised to protect the US president, George W Bush, and other leaders, rather than going on the attack. \"We have a measured approach in dealing with these situations,\" said Royal Canadian mounted police spokesman Mike Gaudet. The postmortem is yet to come, but the Summit of the Americas was not the disaster for police, protesters, property owners or the politicians that it could have been. But a new trade deal is still years away, 2005 at the earliest, and there will be many more meetings to come.

In his book The Unfinished Revolution, Blair's pollster Philip Gould wrote: \"In a campaign you must always seek to gain and keep momentum, or it will pass immediately to your opponent.

The skill of the spin doctor is not simply in putting the best gloss on government announcements (which is as old as politics itself), but in the array of tactics and subtle techniques used to deflect the bad news and promote the good throughout the burgeoning number of media outlets. </p> <p>This applies to all governments. During the Major years, whenever a new chapter in the Charles and Diana saga was revealed, Downing Street would immediately phone all government press offices to suggest it would be a good time for them to release to a distracted media any awkward announcements they had been saving. More recently, when the News of the World revealed that Robin Cook was having an affair with his secretary, the BBC was offered two \"smokescreen\" stories: one involved MI6 allegedly investigating the former governor of Hong Kong, Chris Patten; the other suggested that the government might reprieve the royal yacht Britannia. Neither came to pass, but Cook's marital difficulties suddenly had competition on the nation's front pages and news bulletins. </p> <p>The second pressure is the scale of today's media environment and the impact on budgets. Newspapers have to compete not just with each other, but with four 24-hour news TV channels, internet news sites, more radio stations than ever (not all devoted to music), and a plethora of Sunday lunchtime political slots. Media operations are being forced to cut costs as they struggle to carve out or hang on to a profitable share of the market. The impact is greatest on those areas in need of high investment and perceived as low interest - which makes political reporting the perfect victim. </p> <p>Media organisations are placing far more emphasis on aspects of politics that will generate interest and thus increase ratings or readership.

He kept quiet all the way through the \"Freeserve up for sale\" speculation last year, sealed the deal and then subtly avoided the publicity frenzy that such events usually bring about. </p> <p>His mugshot may have been in all the papers and his name bandied about in internet power-generation lists, but he has carefully kept his distance from the often rumbustious internet scene. Staff talk of his calm, temperate manner and his approachability. Asking around to find a few skeletons in the closet, all I managed to discover was that Pluthero was once a self-confessed MC Hammer fan. Someone had to be. </p> <p>What is he like? \"He's a good bloke, intense but thoughtful,\" responded one employee. \"He has a youthful approach and is big on team bonding,\" said another. Freeserve workers seem respectful of him, but say it is sometimes quite difficult to pin him down as he only spends a few days a week in the London office. The rest of the time he is either at offices in Hertfordshire or Leeds, or jetting over to Paris to be with Wanadoo, who bought Freeserve for \u00a31.6bn in November 2000. </p> <p>Some staff have discovered the art of catching Pluthero: if in doubt look outside the building, as he can often be found pacing up and down at the front entrance, smoking a Silk Cut. For a journalist, however, it is not easy to pin him down. It took six months to get this interview off the ground and even now, after our chat, it is difficult to say just what exactly it is that presses his buttons. </p> <p>Pluthero is very adept at keeping his professional and personal lives separate. He doesn't like to talk about himself, and admits that he is embarrassed about all the attention he gets. It has been two full years since Pluthero was made chief executive of Freeserve in time for its flotation, and he spent the two years before that building up the precocious internet business. In that time he has become something of a figurehead for the UK internet industry, but he laughs off his \"minor celebrity\" status. </p> <p>\"I've always tried to play it straight down the line. I'm perfectly comfortable with running the business side of things, but you have to accept that some of the [media] attention comes with the territory,\" he says. While he would now like to take a step back from the public eye, he acknowledges that it is part and parcel of the business. \"When we did the deal with Wanadoo they told me that I could still be the figurehead in the UK, but I was actually looking forward to moving away from that, and moving out of the limelight for a while.\" </p> <p>This last year has been the pinnacle of Pluthero's business career. After turning a year-old internet company into a stock-market success story, he then had to dilute Dixons' 80% shareholding in Freeserve by managing a sale before internet companies lost all their value. Last year, at just 37, he became one of the youngest ever FTSE100 chief executives. </p> <p>Now 38, does he have anything left to prove? He reckons he does: \"We're not Johnny-come-lately, get-rich-quick people. Freeserve was born out of Dixons as a subscription business, and personal pride means that I'm keen to see it through.\" To this end, he sees himself sticking around at Freeserve and hopes there are plenty more achievements up his sleeve. After all the departures of other big internet companies' bosses, \"I'm kind of like the last man standing - and I rather like that,\" he grins. </p> <p>\"I said to Michel Bon [France Telecom's chairman] and Nicholas Dufourcq [Wanadoo's chief executive] when we were doing the deal that I loved my job and this company and it was up to them whether I stayed or not - and they kept me.\" </p> <p>When the deal went through with Wanadoo last December, the press had a field day joking about the \"love-in\" with Pluthero and Dufourcq. Four months on and Pluthero says things are just getting better and better. \"It's almost treacly how well we get on and how easy it is. It's wonderful, it really is wonderful. We went through a time where we were being unbelievably nice to each other. I was thinking cracks would appear but they haven't to any material extent.\" </p> <p>He insists it has been a very smooth transition period and, on a day-to-day working basis, not too much has changed. \"We have very similar strategies and approaches to things. The important factor is that they not only know their markets, but they are very calm, authoritative grown-up businesspeople. It also helps that the executive board of France Telecom is very tight and that they all sing the same tune.\" </p> <p>The party at the Natural History Museum to celebrate the deal has been given legendary status at Freeserve Towers. Pluthero says staff still talk about it and that it was the best party he has ever been to - not surprising given that it came at the end of a stressful year. </p> <p>But what about Dixons? Pluthero says the relationship with Dixons has got much better. \"It's more straightforward. We haven't got this other thing going on at the same time. We've taken a complex variable out of the equation. They've got a clear schedule on what they can do with their shareholding.\" He is convinced that Dixons, which holds a 12.5% stake in Wanadoo, will always maintain something of a shareholding in the French internet service provider, despite it recently cashing in \u00a3141m of its Wanadoo stake. </p> <p>The reasons for this are twofold, explains Pluthero: firstly, it's an important part of Dixons' strategy to move away from a dependence on hardware profit margins and develop ongoing revenues as an important but smaller part of an internet company; secondly, Dixons needs a European strategy and a partner such as France Telecom gives it a strong ally in several European countries. </p> <p>Pluthero comes across as a modest, unassuming man. He has a boyish grin and an infectious, mischievous laugh. He seems approachable, fun and, most of all, young at heart. He was born and raised in Colchester, where his father ran a pub, and came to London to study economics. </p> <p>His contemporaries and bankers tend to admire him; most make an effort to get to know him, not simply because he has floated a nascent internet company and then sold it for \u00a31.6bn, but because he has done it with such remarkable grace. He persevered with a deal after a buyout by T-Online collapsed, and maintained a cool \"no comment\" exterior when others would have used the press for back-stabbing and turning deals to their own advantage. </p> <p>He admits it was a difficult period, and laughs when I suggest that he is glad a deal didn't happen with T-Online, which has since been rocked by boardroom upheavals. \"Possibly,\" he says. \"It was a tough time. But business is not measured by adversity, it's measured by achievement. You can't give up at the first hurdle. We had to get on with it, and it's self-evident we're at the right place now.\" </p> <p>Pluthero once played rugby to county standard and says he used to be a huge sportsman. But not any more. He has a lower-back problem and doesn't have the time to maintain a golf handicap. Besides, he has an eight-year-old daughter to spend time with. </p> <p>During the week, Pluthero still finds himself working late most nights, but insists he doesn't subscribe to 14-hour day working practices. \"I've never liked the workaholic macho stuff. I've always thought that was really bad. My late nights are because I'm having [working] dinners and not in the office doing stuff.\" </p> <p>His latest extracurricular activity is learning French, a group-wide initiative to save the faces of Freeserve staff when dealing with colleagues on the other side of the channel. It will also facilitate two-way staff traffic between the UK and Paris. Pluthero says he spends four hours a week learning French and plans to spend a month in France this summer to improve his conversational skills. He learns French while being driven by his chauffeur between Freeserve's three offices and says he is coming on in leaps and bounds. He certainly has the time when travelling - last year he did 33,000 business miles, and this year he finds himself jetting back and forth to Paris. </p> <p>What is next on the agenda for Pluthero? One question people are now starting to ask is: will the Wanadoo brand eventually replace the Freeserve brand? Pluthero says it is something they are looking at this year, mainly because the combined companies have so many brands (including Viola, iCircle etc). \"We've not taken any decisions on a rebrand yet, but we discussed the option of Freeserve becoming the no-ties subscription brand across Europe or possibly bringing Wanadoo as a brand to the UK. But we're not going to change brands lightly.\" </p> <p>So it's full steam ahead for Freeserve and Pluthero. With French lessons, UK supremacy, cash in the bank and Europe on his mind, world domination is surely not far off. </p> <p><strong>Related stories</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.mediatheguardian.com/newmedia/story/0,7496,477046,00.html\"> 23.04.2001: Freeserve set to take on Europe</a><br><a href=\"http://talk.mediatheguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee81e3d\">John Pluthero online April 25: post your questions here</a><br><a href=\"http://www.mediatheguardian.com/newmedia/story/0,7496,475424,00.html\">20.04.2001: Internet Magazine's top 50</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "For most people, John Pluthero, the chief executive of Freeserve, has become something of a conundrum. He has tried his deftest to avoid the limelight, keeping as much out of the public eye as possible. He kept quiet all the way through the \"Freeserve up for sale\" speculation last year, sealed the deal and then subtly avoided the publicity frenzy that such events usually bring about. His mugshot may have been in all the papers and his name bandied about in internet power-generation lists, but he has carefully kept his distance from the often rumbustious internet scene. Staff talk of his calm, temperate manner and his approachability. Asking around to find a few skeletons in the closet, all I managed to discover was that Pluthero was once a self-confessed MC Hammer fan. Someone had to be. What is he like? \"He's a good bloke, intense but thoughtful,\" responded one employee. \"He has a youthful approach and is big on team bonding,\" said another. Freeserve workers seem respectful of him, but say it is sometimes quite difficult to pin him down as he only spends a few days a week in the London office.

A decade ago it was selling 290,000 and seemed to have reached a plateau, rising just a little over the following five years to reach 308,000. </p> <p>It was in the autumn of 1997, when editor Richard Lambert went off to New York to focus on the US edition, that the FT began to grow more rapidly. Sales in America were then running at 30,000. Last month it achieved 125,000, a rise of more than 300% in less than four years. </p> <p>The FT's internationalisation strategy has begun to pay off in continental Europe, where its latest figure of 155,000 is 13% up over the past year, easily eclipsing the Wall Street Journal's European venture. Circulation has also risen sharply in Asia, helped by printing from two new sites in Korea and Malaysia, but it is still relatively low at 22,000. </p> <p>In the UK, which accounts for just 39% of the FT's overall sale, its 197,000 average last month was down a little on 12 months ago, but this is probably due to the effects of the dot.com industry's burst bubble. Looking at the longer term, UK circulation has improved by 12% in the last five years. </p> <p>Even so, only 158,000 FTs were sold at the full cover price last month and bulk sales were up to 35,000, a rise of 15,000 on March last year. Britain's competitive newspaper market remains the hardest to crack. </p> <p>Despite the high cost of printing across the world, and a larger journalistic staff than any rival, the FT is highly profitable because of its strong hold on premium advertising. Lambert also believes that, despite having had its share of dot.com problems, it will achieve its pledge to its owners, Pearson, to make ft.com profitable by next year. </p> <p>This month, the FT's sale will probably dip under 500,000 again for seasonal reasons - and, just possibly, because the weekday cover price rises by 5p today to 90p - but I would expect it to be back above the half million regularly by autumn. </p> <p>At the other end of the market, the Daily Star continues to shine, selling more than 9% more than a year ago. Its stablemate, the Daily Express, boasted of reversing its decline but the non-bulk chart shows the truth: it is down almost 10% on a year ago. </p> <p>The Sunday Express's rise was undoubtedly due to the addition of OK! magazine and increased promotion, the first major success for new owner Richard Desmond. </p> <p>Incidentally, you will note a couple of changes to the chart: in order to make the figures consistent, the six-monthly averages now exclude bulks. I have also streamlined the list, using objective criteria to exclude some titles. In order to qualify for entry, a paper must be truly national (available for sale in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland) and must sell at least 100,000 within the UK for a continuous six-month period. </p> <p>Of course, when appropriate, I will refer to papers no longer in the chart, such as the Scotsman and Scotland on Sunday, and the two rising Sunday football titles, Sport First and the Non-League Paper.

      "bodyText": "The Freeserve brand could be extended across Europe under ambitious plans being considered by owner France Telecom. The move would mean Freeserve becoming the company's no-ties subscription-free internet brand across Europe. France Telecom is also considering introducing its French internet brand, Wanadoo, to the UK. These are just two of the options being looked at by John Pluthero, the chief executive of Freeserve and Nicholas Dufourcq, chief executive of Wanadoo. In an interview for MediaGuardian, Mr Pluthero talked about the issues facing them as they consolidate the two businesses. \"We're looking at how to rationalise and take the business forward,\" said Mr Pluthero. \"Freeserve has fantastic brand recognition in the UK. It actually stands for something, so we're not going to change brands lightly.\" But he said they would be looking at options during the course of the year. \"We've discussed the option of Freeserve becoming the no ties subscription-free brand across Europe and the possibility of bringing Wanadoo as a brand to the UK,\" he said. If brought to the UK, Wanadoo, a subscription internet service in France, would go head to head with AOL. If promoted heavily by both Freeserve and Dixons, which holds a 12% stake in Wanadoo, it could give the US internet giant a run for its money. Mr Pluthero was insistent that while they would look at branding issues this year, no decisions had yet been taken. \"There are lots of brands within the group - Viola, iCircle, Apres L'ecole, Wanadoo and Freeserve for instance - and we're looking at how to make the best of them,\" he added.

      "bodyText": "The government is set to bail out debt-laden telecoms companies by giving back the \u00a322bn spent on 3G mobile phone licences. Senior Whitehall sources and telecoms industry insiders confirmed that discussions have taken place over a rebate. The government has watched with mounting concern as stock market heavyweights BT and Vodafone have built up a combined debt of \u00a337bn paying for licences across Europe, with the cost of rolling out a continent-wide network estimated at \u00a3100bn. BT, Vodafone, Orange, One2One and the TIW consortium paid \u00a322.5bn for the UK licences last year, sparking a pan-European spending spree that saw \u00a330bn spent in Germany alone. However, a source close to the negotiations between the operators and the government confirmed that some kind of rebate was inevitable. The most likely scenario is a \"vendor finance\" deal, where the government loans back the licence money to pay for the networks, which will send high-speed internet signals and video images to customers' phones. \"It would be strange if we were not discussing some kind of deal. There will be some sort of deal done over investing in the networks,\" said the source. \"The government will dress it up as encouraging investment, but in effect it will be paying back the companies. They are putting the money back in the pockets of those who paid.\" The source added that \"things went a bit crazy\" during the 3G auction, and the competing companies paid way over the odds for the licences. \"If you are looking for UK plc to build super-services quicker than anywhere else in the world, then you don't want a financial burden to start with,\" the source said. One senior Whitehall source confirmed that the payback was under serious consideration, but the government did not want to be seen to be bailing out BT, which owes \u00a330bn. BT originally intended to reduce its deficit by floating 25% of its BT Wireless subsidiary, but volatile market conditions forced the postponement of the idea. The last-ditch option would be a \u00a35bn share issue, in which shareholders agree to buy new shares in the group, but it would almost certainly cost the jobs of BT's chief executive, Sir Peter Bonfield, and the chairman, Sir Iain Vallance. Meanwhile, a study by telecoms consultancy Quotient Communications has predicted that it could take more than 10 years for the telecoms companies to get their money back, particularly if tight budgets force the operators to offer below-par services. Some analysts fear that the major European telecoms operators will be forced to default on their debts, after they spent a staggering \u00a397bn last year. One way to ease the mounting debt burdens is vendor financing, which has seen telecoms equipment manufacturers such as Nokia loan \u00a31.25bn to Orange to build networks with their products. However, \u00a3100bn will have to be spent on 3G networks over the next four years and Nokia, Ericsson and Motorola have a total of \u00a390bn available in shareholders' funds. The European Investment Bank has already been mentioned as a possible source of financing for the networks, and the UK government's involvement will raise hopes of intervention from other European governments. Germany's Deutsche Telekom owes \u00a336bn and the German government is a major shareholder in the company. Related story 20.03.2001: How BT got the numbers wrong",

I use multimap.co.uk for every appointment and love decanter.com for wine. Last online purchase? A Skoda Fabia for my wife. I knew the model I wanted so it was just a question of getting the cheapest price. I couldn't believe how many cars there were - literally thousands to choose from. Last technological faux pas? Quite recently I took a laptop to a conference but left my power lead behind. I can't believe that nobody has invented a universal power lead. News sources on the web? I tap into the PA site because we're part of it and I've used it from the word go. I also use ft.com, thisismoney.com and thisislondon.co.uk in the afternoon. I use the BBC quite a lot and look at newspapers online. Time spent on the web? Probably about two hours a day by the time I've looked at our competitors and about two hours at the weekend. I love the sports information on it and rarely use the TV now. The internet is much more convenient. Site least likely to succeed? I think they've got to have an e-commerce model.

We have disabled TiVo's much-vaunted capacity to analyse your preferences and scoot around recording shows that you might like. It started off by recording about 10 episodes of The Simpsons - a not inaccurate summary of our 10-year-old's tastes, but a rather monothematic archive. </p> <p>I have not yet revealed TiVo's most miraculous, most beneficial facility - something that could bring peace and harmony to domestic life while, coincidentally, lowering the crime rate. Family mealtimes have been all but destroyed by TV suppers. Now, the pause button in the TiVo handset could change all that. Instantly, the rest of a programme can be recorded, and thus attendance at meals is inescapable. </p> <p>But while TiVo is reforming and purifying western society, will it be destroying both the brand and the economics of the TV channel? Not really. To use it intelligently you still instruct it to go to particular channels to record programmes. Indeed, its whole architecture is based on the channel structure. Hence its deal, announced on Friday, with Channel 4 to preview its shows as the beginning of a relationship. But, no one is yet distributing a truly flexible electronic programme guide through which you can locate a programme via its star or production company. Even TiVo's relatively liberating listing of genres does, in the end, direct you to a programme description that includes a channel identity. </p> <p>Then there is the question of whether we skip the advertisements of TiVo-recorded programmes. On the evidence of our household, yes. On the evidence of research from Continental Research presented by Caroline Bell at March's TV2001 conference, yes again.

It guarantees that staff without a professional qualification will have access to either an individual learning account, with \u00a3150 funding per year, or dedicated training to national vocational qualification (NVQ) level two or three. The investment is intended to improve the training opportunities available to a huge \"invisible army\" of healthcare assistants, operating department practitioners, pharmacy technicians and others. The NVQ system is well established but individual learning accounts (ILAs) are, as far the health service is concerned, something new. The scheme, which begins this month, will run alongside the existing ILA arrangements, run by the Department for Education and Employment. Indeed, guidance recently released by the Department of Health states that NHS employees should also be encouraged to open a DfEE ILA, which is worth an additional \u00a3150. This means that \u00a3300 in central government funding is now available to individual health service staff who have previously had little, or nothing, spent on their training needs. Two ILA courses have been launched, following a collaboration between the NHS executive, Unison and the Workers Educational Association (WEA). Pathways to the future offers practical help with re-entry to learning, while improving study skills prepares those already qualified to NVQ 2 and 3 levels to step up to professional training. Each course involves 10.5 days of study supported by a tutor. Employers who want to provide their staff with opportunities for group learning can turn to WEA regional co-ordinators for help in setting up learning at work courses. Unison's well-established return to learn courses will also be funded under the ILA scheme. To be eligible for an ILA payment, the training or learning must be work-related - in other words, it must contribute to employees' ability to carry out their current job, or help them in a job to which they might realistically expect to be appointed to in the future. Learning activities must also fit within the employee's personal development plan. It is up to individual employees to apply to join the scheme; employers authorise or reject applications.

Commissioner Frits Bolkestein says it is no good the European Union setting frameworks for a common market if member states do not then introduce legislation at home to allow citizens and business to take advantage of the new commercial opportunities offered. In all, about one eighth of EU internal market legislation has still not been implemented by one or more member states.</p> <p>The explanation is that the political game continues long after legislation has been passed in Brussels. Fierce bargaining (and some cheating) go on long after the event. Domestic interest groups exert pressure to water down rules they disagree with or beef up others. It is not easy for national governments. Conflict with interest groups can cost votes which is why they like to shift blame to Brussels. The European commission gets stick although it is the council of ministers - made up of members of national governments - and the European parliament, which is of course directly elected from member states, that formally adopt most EU laws.</p> <p>In the mid-1990s the Tory government fiercely opposed the 48-hour week directive in the council of ministers, not only for ideological reasons, but also as a means of depicting themselves as an guarantor of the national interest against \"intrusions\". Having lost the battle in Brussels, the Major government decided to fight it again at the implementation stage.</p> <p>National governments are quick to claim the credit for popular EU initiatives, leaving the EU in a no-win situation. The theory is that EU laws need to be turned into laws in the member states to allow account to be taken of national peculiarities. In practice the transposition process is so highly politicised that it becomes a bottle- neck. The problem is that if EU law is not transposed properly, or at all, firms and other interested parties, such as workers deserving protection in their workplace, are obliged to take legal action in order to force national authorities to comply with EU obligations. Both Italy and Austria have been taken to the European Court by the commission for not putting into law a directive on protecting workers from exposure to biological agents.

      "bodyText": "The European Commission last week reviewed progress since the Lisbon summit a year ago and complained that member states are proving slow in making the \"internal market\" a reality. The reason why a single market has been so long in arriving rests on the peculiar relationship between Brussels and the nations. Commissioner Frits Bolkestein says it is no good the European Union setting frameworks for a common market if member states do not then introduce legislation at home to allow citizens and business to take advantage of the new commercial opportunities offered. In all, about one eighth of EU internal market legislation has still not been implemented by one or more member states. The explanation is that the political game continues long after legislation has been passed in Brussels. Fierce bargaining (and some cheating) go on long after the event. Domestic interest groups exert pressure to water down rules they disagree with or beef up others. It is not easy for national governments. Conflict with interest groups can cost votes which is why they like to shift blame to Brussels. The European commission gets stick although it is the council of ministers - made up of members of national governments - and the European parliament, which is of course directly elected from member states, that formally adopt most EU laws. In the mid-1990s the Tory government fiercely opposed the 48-hour week directive in the council of ministers, not only for ideological reasons, but also as a means of depicting themselves as an guarantor of the national interest against \"intrusions\". Having lost the battle in Brussels, the Major government decided to fight it again at the implementation stage. National governments are quick to claim the credit for popular EU initiatives, leaving the EU in a no-win situation. The theory is that EU laws need to be turned into laws in the member states to allow account to be taken of national peculiarities. In practice the transposition process is so highly politicised that it becomes a bottle- neck. The problem is that if EU law is not transposed properly, or at all, firms and other interested parties, such as workers deserving protection in their workplace, are obliged to take legal action in order to force national authorities to comply with EU obligations. Both Italy and Austria have been taken to the European Court by the commission for not putting into law a directive on protecting workers from exposure to biological agents. Such legal process is cumbersome, slow and costly. The UK is often portrayed as a bad European partner but has a relatively good record. The UK certainly plays political hardball in Brussels when European legislation is being formulated and decided. Yet when it comes to transposition and actual implementation, the UK shifts to a much more technical and less political mode. France is often seen as the key case of a member state which is at the \"centre of Europe\" yet often fails to implement European law. Last year the commission issued a \"reasoned opinion\" against France for the non-transposi tion of directive 93/35 relating to cosmetics.

Dioxins form at high temperatures in the presence of carbon, hydrogen and chlorine. Pyres contain chlorine because they are built with creosote-soaked railway sleepers and tyres. The dead livestock contain hydrogen and carbon compounds, and the fires are lit with hydrocarbon fuels such as kerosene.</p> <p>\u0095 Fears that foot and mouth had infected wild deer were raised yesterday after a vet claimed to have identified the symptoms in a dead roe deer found near Penrith in Cumbria last week. The finding could undermine the government's \"isolate and slaughter\" policy as experts believe it is a practical impossibility to cull deer since panicked wild animals scatter. Tests are being carried out on the carcass.</p> <p>Andrew Hoon, chairman of the government's deer initiative body, said: \"The more you chase wild deer around the more they run around. It's impossible. An epidemic would be a very serious situation.\" Maff said it had no confirmation of any wild deer being infected with foot and mouth.</p> <p>By yesterday the number of confirmed foot and mouth cases had reached 1,439. Restrictions were lifted, however, in north Somerset, east and central Wiltshire, and in parts of Berkshire and Hampshire. More than 2,600 farms were last night due to be released from infected area restrictions on moving animals.</p> <p><b>Email update</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/email\">Sign

In 1991 milk from farms near an incinerator at Bolsover in Derbyshire had to be thrown away because it contained excess dioxins. Dioxins form at high temperatures in the presence of carbon, hydrogen and chlorine. Pyres contain chlorine because they are built with creosote-soaked railway sleepers and tyres. The dead livestock contain hydrogen and carbon compounds, and the fires are lit with hydrocarbon fuels such as kerosene. \u0095 Fears that foot and mouth had infected wild deer were raised yesterday after a vet claimed to have identified the symptoms in a dead roe deer found near Penrith in Cumbria last week. The finding could undermine the government's \"isolate and slaughter\" policy as experts believe it is a practical impossibility to cull deer since panicked wild animals scatter. Tests are being carried out on the carcass. Andrew Hoon, chairman of the government's deer initiative body, said: \"The more you chase wild deer around the more they run around. It's impossible. An epidemic would be a very serious situation.\" Maff said it had no confirmation of any wild deer being infected with foot and mouth. By yesterday the number of confirmed foot and mouth cases had reached 1,439. Restrictions were lifted, however, in north Somerset, east and central Wiltshire, and in parts of Berkshire and Hampshire. More than 2,600 farms were last night due to be released from infected area restrictions on moving animals. Email update Sign up for our free daily foot and mouth round-up What's going on?

A scathing report into the regeneration project has revealed that on three separate occasions officers from the local authority voiced their concerns about the running of the agency, headed by Liberal Democrat councillor Frank O'Donohue, who retired from the company in January. But, claims the Labour opposition, the authority has only now moved to withdraw funding. Labour is calling for a full investigation into why the agency continued to receive grant aid when the local authority's own officers had been highly critical of its performance. They also want the authority to draw up guidelines that prevent anyone whose major income derives from council funding to be barred from standing for election. Up to his retirement in January, Mr O'Donohue, 65, ran the Valley and Netherley Together Economic Development Trust, a community-based economic development organisation which attempts to encourage social enterprises in those two areas of Liverpool. Since 1995, the agency has received a total of \u00a3270,000 and helped created 20 jobs in a company involved in CCTV, but these jobs are on fixed-term contracts and are not permanent. In his highly critical report, executive director for regeneration Charlie Parker says after an assessment in 1997 officers made numerous recommendations, including the drawing up of a long-term business plan, which had not been done. Two years later officers found that progress had been slow and suggested a qualified agency be brought in to help. A year later, in February 2000, council officers decided the firm was unlikely to succeed. In the report, Mr Parker says: \"The organisation has not demonstrated any move towards self-sustainability, has failed to deliver agreed outputs and it is considered that further financial assistance does not reflect an effective use of public money.\" Labour's economic development spokesman, councillor Malcolm Kennedy, said: \"There are a lot on unanswered questions, such as why it has been left so long to do anything about this business. \"What is an issue is that political parties should not be putting people forward as candidates whose major income comes from public funds and that is something we are approaching the authority about.\" The council has now decided to stop funding the regeneration project but has made \u00a316,000 available as a contingency fund to cover any outstanding liabilities.

Four out of 10 women surveyed by Eve magazine's website, Allabouteve.co.uk, said they visit sex websites, with a third doing so in the company of their partner. While 63% said they were interested in getting online tips for a better sex life, 78% said they would steer clear of sex chat rooms. Cybersex also got the thumbs down with 84% rejecting it out of hand and 87% stating they would not be interested in finding a sexual partner online. However, visiting sex sites is largely seen as something that will help enhance an existing relationship rather than a way of meeting new partners. More than half said they were interested in advice and support on sex, 46% said they would buy sex books, toys or videos online, and 40% said they were interested in using the internet to explore different sexual practices. The survey polled more than 1,100 people, of which 65% were married, 70% were aged 26-45, 96% were heterosexual and 48% had children. Useful link allabouteve.co.uk",

Creator Tony Garnett and the BBC2 controller, Jane Root, took the decision to cut Attachments down from 50 to 30-minute episodes after disappointing ratings for the first run last autumn. Attachments averaged just 1.2m and a 5% share - less than half BBC2's average share for 2000 of 10.8% - across 10 weeks on Tuesday night from late September. \"Attachments is going to be coming back in a 30-minute guise on BBC2 later this year,\" a BBC spokesman confirmed. Ms Root ordered two 10-part series of the show when she originally commissioned it last year. It was not yet decided whether Attachments would still return as a 10-parter, the spokesman said. \"They are working on the scripts right now,\" he added. Attachments followed the trials and tribulations of Mike, a young dot.com entrepreneur attempting to turn Seethru.co.uk, the cutting-edge music site he started in his bedroom, into a viable internet content business. The show was commissioned while the dot.com bubble was still growing, but by the time it was broadcast last autumn the internet crash was well underway and the public's love affair with all things new media had turned sour. Mr Garnett is a legendary drama producer with a track record running from Cathy Come Home in the 1960s to This Life and the Cops in the 1990s, through his company World Productions. The real life Seethru.co.uk website was launched when the series was broadcast and year and has been maintained as an independently functioning content site since then. But the site is to take a summer break while the Seethru.co.uk team prepare for the second series of Attachments. \"There will be less new material going up on the site over the summer as we get it ready for when the series returns in the autumn,\" the BBC spokesman said.

Carlton and Granada hoped the service would appeal to middle England, a market it assumed would want more TV channels but not necessarily the 200 or so on offer from BSkyB or the dish that comes with it. ONdigital offers about a quarter of that number. </p> <p>But figures due to be published on Wednesday will show ONdigital's growth slowing in the first three months of the year, during which it added only around 50,000 customers. The company has 1m subscribers and appears to have given up hopes of reaching its target of hitting 2m by the end of 2002. BSkyB, the market leader, has more than 5m customers. </p> <p>Subscribers are also abandoning ONdigital at a faster rate than BSkyB. Its churn rate, the percentage of cus tomers giving up their subscriptions, is understood to be between 20-25%. </p> <p>Carlton and Granada are under pressure from investors to cap the amount of money they are pouring into ONdigital. When the pair unveiled the platform in May 1998, they said it would need \u00a3300m funding before it reached breakeven, but that figure has escalated to \u00a31.2bn. ONdigital has come under severe pressure from the aggressive tactics of BSkyB and was forced to match its expensive giveaway of the set top boxes needed to receive digital signals. </p> <p>Regulations preventing a full merger of Carlton and Granada will be removed by the forthcoming Communications Bill but competition law would prevent a deal taking place for some time. ITV still accounts for 60% of television advertising despite the arrival of Channel 5 and the proliferation of new digital channels. </p> <p>A number of candidates turned down the job of ITV Network chief executive last year, a role vacated by Richard Eyre in January 2000. Carlton and Granada put the search on ice after buying United's ITV assets.</p>",

But figures due to be published on Wednesday will show ONdigital's growth slowing in the first three months of the year, during which it added only around 50,000 customers. The company has 1m subscribers and appears to have given up hopes of reaching its target of hitting 2m by the end of 2002. BSkyB, the market leader, has more than 5m customers. Subscribers are also abandoning ONdigital at a faster rate than BSkyB. Its churn rate, the percentage of cus tomers giving up their subscriptions, is understood to be between 20-25%. Carlton and Granada are under pressure from investors to cap the amount of money they are pouring into ONdigital. When the pair unveiled the platform in May 1998, they said it would need \u00a3300m funding before it reached breakeven, but that figure has escalated to \u00a31.2bn. ONdigital has come under severe pressure from the aggressive tactics of BSkyB and was forced to match its expensive giveaway of the set top boxes needed to receive digital signals. Regulations preventing a full merger of Carlton and Granada will be removed by the forthcoming Communications Bill but competition law would prevent a deal taking place for some time. ITV still accounts for 60% of television advertising despite the arrival of Channel 5 and the proliferation of new digital channels. A number of candidates turned down the job of ITV Network chief executive last year, a role vacated by Richard Eyre in January 2000. Carlton and Granada put the search on ice after buying United's ITV assets.",

The format would, for example, allow a farmer, an animal rights activist, a city dweller and a vet to have their say on the foot and mouth crisis. The programme will be broadcast in July and August and will not be presenter led, although Mr Stanford said it may use some of the BBC's higher-profile current affairs and news reporters.

Four by Four will air on Monday night at 7.30pm, the slot occupied by current affairs shows like Kenyon Confronts, Crime Squad and Hard Cash. The BBC has been experimenting for some time with different current affairs formats in a bid to find an enduring popular format. Head of current affairs Peter Horrocks has expressed his intention to develop a new generation of strong, popular current affairs programmes.

      "body": "<p>How sad is this? I'm watching people logging on to the internet. I'm staring at two men in their mid-20s and two slightly older women, who are all staring into computer screens. This is the virtual world's equivalent of watching grass grow - and I'm finding it interesting. </p> <p> But that's maybe because of the voyeuristic thrill of it all. I'm standing, observing but unobserved, behind a huge 12ft x 6ft two-way mirror. It looks like a lightly electrified cinema screen, set before two rows of tip-up seats and a well-stocked fridge for the use of advertising executives and clients as they watch their guinea pigs.</p> <p> But we are not here for voyeuristic thrills. The whole purpose of this session at the offices of the leading advertising agency BMP in Paddington, London, is to get rid of the idea of the internet as something that is sexy but aimless and unproductive. Gone are the days of companies saying \"we've got a lot of money and this is a whole new sector, so let's suck it and see. Whoopee!\" </p> <p>Now it's path-to-profit time, and the internet industry is learning that if it doesn't work, it doesn't eat. Advertising, in particular, has to be seen to work to justify the spend from a marketing director's budget, which is why I'm behind the screen, watching the consumer group brought together by Billco, the new-media agency subsidiary of BMP.</p> <p> The old economy and the economics of the corner shop have caught up with, and publicly disembowelled, last year's cyperbole. The businesses and ideas left standing now that the hype has exploded have to satisfy some very serious, old-economy tests. BMP is generally regarded as being a very serious advertising agency, and Billco's managing director, Alison Parker, is leading the consumer group through a classic qualitative research session.</p> <p> Parker asks the group about their general use of the internet and whether they use sites offering holiday services (the client is in this sector), then asks them to go online and play with the site. The users have the classic technophile profile. They use the research engine to squeeze comparative value out of the market. And they are not afraid to send their credit card numbers out into the ether.

      "bodyText": "How sad is this? I'm watching people logging on to the internet. I'm staring at two men in their mid-20s and two slightly older women, who are all staring into computer screens. This is the virtual world's equivalent of watching grass grow - and I'm finding it interesting. But that's maybe because of the voyeuristic thrill of it all. I'm standing, observing but unobserved, behind a huge 12ft x 6ft two-way mirror. It looks like a lightly electrified cinema screen, set before two rows of tip-up seats and a well-stocked fridge for the use of advertising executives and clients as they watch their guinea pigs. But we are not here for voyeuristic thrills. The whole purpose of this session at the offices of the leading advertising agency BMP in Paddington, London, is to get rid of the idea of the internet as something that is sexy but aimless and unproductive. Gone are the days of companies saying \"we've got a lot of money and this is a whole new sector, so let's suck it and see. Whoopee!\" Now it's path-to-profit time, and the internet industry is learning that if it doesn't work, it doesn't eat. Advertising, in particular, has to be seen to work to justify the spend from a marketing director's budget, which is why I'm behind the screen, watching the consumer group brought together by Billco, the new-media agency subsidiary of BMP. The old economy and the economics of the corner shop have caught up with, and publicly disembowelled, last year's cyperbole. The businesses and ideas left standing now that the hype has exploded have to satisfy some very serious, old-economy tests. BMP is generally regarded as being a very serious advertising agency, and Billco's managing director, Alison Parker, is leading the consumer group through a classic qualitative research session. Parker asks the group about their general use of the internet and whether they use sites offering holiday services (the client is in this sector), then asks them to go online and play with the site. The users have the classic technophile profile. They use the research engine to squeeze comparative value out of the market. And they are not afraid to send their credit card numbers out into the ether. One of the women used a shopping site to buy a Dyson cleaner at a discount of \u00a360 on its high-street price, and had the appliance delivered within two days. One of the men has used the net to search out the best price for a car. Both men and one of the women go online for football news, and everyone agrees that Amazon has a good site - especially if you belong to a book club and want to crib a review.

      "bodyText": "Guardians of Italian food are preparing to wade into battle against a tide of sushi, curries and burgers which they say is sweeping away pasta. The Academy of Italian Cooking will meet at the Umbrian medieval hill fortress of Gubbio tomorrow to plot a counterattack. Globalisation's downfall will be toasted between courses of tagliolini with anchovies, white truffles, boar, mixed meats with cress and pigeon with olives. Action is urgent as Italians are succumbing to the siren call of the new, said Giuseppe Dell'Osso, the academy's spokesman. \"Globalisation is driving our country's traditional dishes to extinction,\" he told La Repubblica. Restaurants and catering schools were exalting Japanese, Indian, Chinese, Arabic and American dishes above homegrown delicacies. \"They are losing typical plates such as bucatini all'amatriciana,\" said Mr Dell'Osso. Foreigners, and Italians who returned from abroad, were laying traps for the national palate with alien concotions. \"Alarm, alarm,\" said La Repubblica. \"Even Italy is a conquered land.\" Chefs scorned the initiative as xenophobic scare tactics which ignored the fact that Italian cuisine had evolved over centuries with infusions of spices, vegetables and meats. \"This is the history of a cui sine with soul, not an invasion,\" said Livia Iaccarini, of Don Alfonso, a restaurant with three Michelin stars. Andrea Fenoglio said his list of non-Italian dishes at his Sissi di Merano restaurant was no cause for concern. \"We still know how to prepare tortellini in brodo.\" The academy was unlikely to be reassured. Purists of Italian food and drink have become increasingly defensive. Starbucks, the American coffee house chain, announced this month that it would open outlets in Italy next year, hot on the heels of ambitious expansions by McDonald's and Burger King. Gourmets, traditional restaurants and political activists have gathered under the banner Slow Food, a movement based in Turin. Last October riot police mobilised to protect McDonald's outlets from thousands of demonstrators who chanted \"Better a day of tortellini than 100 days of hamburgers.\"",

Mr Green said the service would allow Britain to catch up with other parts of Europe. \"We have let our sights drop. The first advanced passenger train in the world was produced in Britain in December 1979 and broke the UK speed record at 160mph.\"",

WPM couldn't find a glass of water, so she downed a large gin and tonic instead. She doesn't remember much about the rest of the Blue Arrow spring cleaning pointers.

If you sit opposite the grand fromage, you won't be getting no doodling action in meetings anymore. No siree. And there'll be none of that letting your mind nip off to Tesco.

It's a way of clarifying things. I was told that my career choice was right and that I should carry on pursuing it. Since then I've found a job in the medical field,\" he says. Spooky or plain coincidence? Pertemps has yet to decide if and how it is going to implement the findings of its research. Perhaps it, too, should consult the stars.",

      "body": "<p>The pain of rejection is etched on the faces of the young apprentices at Cammell Laird shipyard in Birkenhead. They are facing a bleak future following the company's collapse into receivership. </p> <p>When the 240 workers began their four-year apprenticeships, they were assured that they had a career for life. Because they have not finished their training, they feel all their efforts have been wasted. </p> <p>An air of uncertainty hangs over the shipyard, with its panoramic views of Liverpool's Anglican and Catholic cathedrals. </p> <p>\"If we have not got our certificates behind us, then it doesn't mean anything to other companies because we are not time served,\" said Anthony Hardacre, 20. \"This doesn't just affect me. Some members of my family are subcontractors here and they do the painting. They will be badly hit if this place closes.\" </p> <p>Paul Gillies, 23, who is in the fourth year of his apprenticeship, is so close to finishing in September but is unlikely to do so because of the problems. </p> <p>Darren Reid, 20, said the apprentices made up a third of the workforce but believed they were being treated by the management as third-class citizens. \"There was a mass meeting at Cammell Laird the other week and we weren't even mentioned. It's as if we don't exist. I would like to know what our future is, because all we can see now is doom and gloom. In three weeks' time we will all be out of a job and we feel robbed of our future.\" </p> <p>His grandfather was a foreman fitter at the yard. \"I remember being told by someone how lucky I was to be taken on as an apprentice. Now I just want to rip his tongue out.\" He is supposed to complete an NVQ level 3 in July but is unsure whether he will be able to do so. </p> <p>Carl O'Shea's grandfather was a chargehand shipwright and his uncle is a fitter. \"When we started here we thought it was a job for life - it shows how wrong we were.\" </p> <p>James Mitchell, 22, said apprentices were always the last to know about the crisis at the yard. He predicted the first thing they would learn about their jobs being axed was when they arrive at work to find padlocks on the gates. He feels as if he has wasted three years of his life. He has taken home his tools - which are worth \u00a32,000 -so he doesn't lose them to the receivers when the gates are barred. </p> <p>All of the apprentices say that Cammell Laird has handled the crisis badly. Ian Adamson, 20, has a partner and an eight-month-old baby to support. He said he was worried about the future but did not really talk about the crisis at home because he does not know what will happen to him. </p> <p>Paul Burns, 23, bought a new car three weeks before the shipyard got into difficulties. He did not take out payment protection insurance because he thought there would be no need. \"When we became apprentices, the prospects looked good for us. Three weeks later, I found out that I did need the payment protection, but it is too late. I am now worried that I am going to get blacklisted if I get into difficulties.\" </p> <p>The apprentices have written to em ployment secretary David Blunkett and Tony Blair expressing their concern. They asked the prime minister: \"How would you feel if, at the age of 18 years, one of your sons came home from work and said to yourself and your wife: 'If we don't get the contract to build these ships, I may not be able to complete my apprenticeship'?\" They received a reply from the prime minister which said their letter had been forwarded to the Department of Trade and Industry. </p> <p>Last week the shipyard shed 150 jobs; another 170 were lost at the company's yards on Teesside and Tyneside. Brendan Reynolds, the AEEU's shop steward, said the apprentices represented the future of the shipyard. \"Where are these kids going to go when this place closes down? It is like an extended family for them here - everybody knows one another and that is the spirit of the yard. We feel that these kids have been abandoned by Tony Blair's government.\" </p> <p>There are hopes the business can be sold. Potential bidders are said to include A&amp;P, a group owned by the private equity arm of Royal Bank of Scotland, the bank that pulled the plug on Cammell Laird.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The pain of rejection is etched on the faces of the young apprentices at Cammell Laird shipyard in Birkenhead. They are facing a bleak future following the company's collapse into receivership. When the 240 workers began their four-year apprenticeships, they were assured that they had a career for life. Because they have not finished their training, they feel all their efforts have been wasted. An air of uncertainty hangs over the shipyard, with its panoramic views of Liverpool's Anglican and Catholic cathedrals. \"If we have not got our certificates behind us, then it doesn't mean anything to other companies because we are not time served,\" said Anthony Hardacre, 20. \"This doesn't just affect me. Some members of my family are subcontractors here and they do the painting. They will be badly hit if this place closes.\" Paul Gillies, 23, who is in the fourth year of his apprenticeship, is so close to finishing in September but is unlikely to do so because of the problems. Darren Reid, 20, said the apprentices made up a third of the workforce but believed they were being treated by the management as third-class citizens. \"There was a mass meeting at Cammell Laird the other week and we weren't even mentioned. It's as if we don't exist. I would like to know what our future is, because all we can see now is doom and gloom. In three weeks' time we will all be out of a job and we feel robbed of our future.\" His grandfather was a foreman fitter at the yard. \"I remember being told by someone how lucky I was to be taken on as an apprentice. Now I just want to rip his tongue out.\" He is supposed to complete an NVQ level 3 in July but is unsure whether he will be able to do so. Carl O'Shea's grandfather was a chargehand shipwright and his uncle is a fitter. \"When we started here we thought it was a job for life - it shows how wrong we were.\" James Mitchell, 22, said apprentices were always the last to know about the crisis at the yard. He predicted the first thing they would learn about their jobs being axed was when they arrive at work to find padlocks on the gates. He feels as if he has wasted three years of his life. He has taken home his tools - which are worth \u00a32,000 -so he doesn't lose them to the receivers when the gates are barred. All of the apprentices say that Cammell Laird has handled the crisis badly. Ian Adamson, 20, has a partner and an eight-month-old baby to support. He said he was worried about the future but did not really talk about the crisis at home because he does not know what will happen to him. Paul Burns, 23, bought a new car three weeks before the shipyard got into difficulties. He did not take out payment protection insurance because he thought there would be no need. \"When we became apprentices, the prospects looked good for us. Three weeks later, I found out that I did need the payment protection, but it is too late. I am now worried that I am going to get blacklisted if I get into difficulties.\" The apprentices have written to em ployment secretary David Blunkett and Tony Blair expressing their concern. They asked the prime minister: \"How would you feel if, at the age of 18 years, one of your sons came home from work and said to yourself and your wife: 'If we don't get the contract to build these ships, I may not be able to complete my apprenticeship'?\" They received a reply from the prime minister which said their letter had been forwarded to the Department of Trade and Industry. Last week the shipyard shed 150 jobs; another 170 were lost at the company's yards on Teesside and Tyneside. Brendan Reynolds, the AEEU's shop steward, said the apprentices represented the future of the shipyard. \"Where are these kids going to go when this place closes down? It is like an extended family for them here - everybody knows one another and that is the spirit of the yard. We feel that these kids have been abandoned by Tony Blair's government.\" There are hopes the business can be sold. Potential bidders are said to include A&amp;P, a group owned by the private equity arm of Royal Bank of Scotland, the bank that pulled the plug on Cammell Laird.",

      "byline": "Alfred Hickling",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>In 1969 Nina Simone halted a concert at New York's Philharmonic Hall and announced that she wished to introduce a new song. The emotion of the moment was captured on the live album Black Gold: \"I want to talk about a friend ... It seems that she comes alive more and more. I'm talking about Lorraine Hansberry. This is the story of her life, and each time I do it she comes a little bit closer and I miss her a little bit more. It's called Young, Gifted and Black.\" </p> <p>Ten years earlier Hansberry, who herself coined that beautiful phrase, had become an overnight celebrity with her first play, A Raisin in the Sun. She was the first black woman to have a play produced on Broadway and, at 29, the youngest winner of the New York Critics' Play of the Year award. Raisin was later made into a film, with Sidney Poitier recreating his performance in the leading role. Hansberry's striking, statuesque features appeared in Vogue, while Show magazine dispatched a list of questions about Shakespeare and published her response alongside those of TS Eliot, Harry S Truman and Igor Stravinsky. </p> <p>In America A Raisin in the Sun now has the status of an unassailable classic. Libraries are named after Hansberry and she is studied in college, the cult boosted by a dramatisation of her writings called To Be Young, Gifted and Black, brought together by her ex-husband, Robert Nemiroff. But in Britain, in the words of actor Lennie James, Raisin has become \"one of those classics people recognise by name but can never remember who wrote it\". </p> <p>James is currently preparing to star as Walter - the role that made Poitier famous - in the first major staging of Raisin in this country for 15 years. This co-production between the Young Vic and Salisbury Playhouse is one of two plays set to re-impress Hansberry's name on the British consciousness. This month Manchester's Royal Exchange presents the British premiere of Hansberry's last work, Les Blancs, which has never before been seen outside America. </p> <p>The almost total disappearance of Hansberry's work from the UK - where none of her writing is now in print - has less to do with its quality than with its quantity. When Martin Luther King proclaimed that she \"would remain an inspiration to generations yet unborn\" he did not know how quickly that would be put to the test. Hansberry's second play, The Sign in Sydney Brustein's Window, closed on Broadway after mixed reviews on January 12 1965. On the same night Hansberry, 34, died. She had been diagnosed with cancer less than 18 months earlier. </p> <p>In his memoir Sweet Lorraine, writer James Baldwin fondly recalled days spent debating and shooting the breeze with his fellow Greenwich Village intellectual. He claimed that A Raisin in the Sun, written while Hansberry made a living as a waitress and cashier, \"put more of the truth of black people's lives on the stage than any other play in the entire history of theatre\". That statement has been quoted to the point of cliche, but New York-born actress Novella Nelson, currently rehearsing the role of Mama for the Young Vic revival, was a young student at the time of the original production, and confirms its impact. \"I saw those people up on stage and thought, 'My God - that's my family up there.'

      "bodyText": "In 1969 Nina Simone halted a concert at New York's Philharmonic Hall and announced that she wished to introduce a new song. The emotion of the moment was captured on the live album Black Gold: \"I want to talk about a friend ... It seems that she comes alive more and more. I'm talking about Lorraine Hansberry. This is the story of her life, and each time I do it she comes a little bit closer and I miss her a little bit more. It's called Young, Gifted and Black.\" Ten years earlier Hansberry, who herself coined that beautiful phrase, had become an overnight celebrity with her first play, A Raisin in the Sun. She was the first black woman to have a play produced on Broadway and, at 29, the youngest winner of the New York Critics' Play of the Year award. Raisin was later made into a film, with Sidney Poitier recreating his performance in the leading role. Hansberry's striking, statuesque features appeared in Vogue, while Show magazine dispatched a list of questions about Shakespeare and published her response alongside those of TS Eliot, Harry S Truman and Igor Stravinsky. In America A Raisin in the Sun now has the status of an unassailable classic. Libraries are named after Hansberry and she is studied in college, the cult boosted by a dramatisation of her writings called To Be Young, Gifted and Black, brought together by her ex-husband, Robert Nemiroff. But in Britain, in the words of actor Lennie James, Raisin has become \"one of those classics people recognise by name but can never remember who wrote it\". James is currently preparing to star as Walter - the role that made Poitier famous - in the first major staging of Raisin in this country for 15 years. This co-production between the Young Vic and Salisbury Playhouse is one of two plays set to re-impress Hansberry's name on the British consciousness. This month Manchester's Royal Exchange presents the British premiere of Hansberry's last work, Les Blancs, which has never before been seen outside America. The almost total disappearance of Hansberry's work from the UK - where none of her writing is now in print - has less to do with its quality than with its quantity. When Martin Luther King proclaimed that she \"would remain an inspiration to generations yet unborn\" he did not know how quickly that would be put to the test. Hansberry's second play, The Sign in Sydney Brustein's Window, closed on Broadway after mixed reviews on January 12 1965. On the same night Hansberry, 34, died. She had been diagnosed with cancer less than 18 months earlier. In his memoir Sweet Lorraine, writer James Baldwin fondly recalled days spent debating and shooting the breeze with his fellow Greenwich Village intellectual. He claimed that A Raisin in the Sun, written while Hansberry made a living as a waitress and cashier, \"put more of the truth of black people's lives on the stage than any other play in the entire history of theatre\". That statement has been quoted to the point of cliche, but New York-born actress Novella Nelson, currently rehearsing the role of Mama for the Young Vic revival, was a young student at the time of the original production, and confirms its impact. \"I saw those people up on stage and thought, 'My God - that's my family up there.' There had simply never been plays of colour in that arena before - it made me want to become an actress. It changed my life.\" A Raisin in the Sun borrowed its title from a line in the poem Harlem by Langston Hughes, whom Hansberry met while writing for the radical African American paper Freedom. Hughes's poem asks what happens \"to a dream deferred\": Does it dry up Like a raisin in the sun? Or does it explode? Even though the play was written well before the marches on Washington, the death of Martin Luther King or the inner-city uprisings, Hansberry, according to Nelson, \"somehow managed to foresee history whole - the rise of black nationalism, the Pan-African movement, even feminism\". Raisin depicts the hostility faced by a black family when they attempt to move into an exclusive white neighbourhood - a bitter experience drawn from life. Although Hansberry was born in Chicago's Southside ghetto, her father was a relatively prosperous businessman. As such, she remembered \"being the only child in my classes who did not come from the Rooseveltian atmosphere of the homes of the 1930s. My mother sent me to kindergarten in a white fur in the middle of a depression.

Tate Britain, Millbank, SW1 (020-7887 8008) until June 3, free. Ross Sinclair Large scale installations and photographs by Scottish artist Ross Sinclair, who continues his inquiry into REAL LIFE Vs THE WORLD.

Curve Gallery, Barbican Centre, Silk Street, EC2 (020-7638 4141) until June 3, free. Solo Shows Victoria Miro's new space is so big it can easily fit three substantial solo shows. Tracey Moffat's weirdly sinister photo-collages, Annika von Hausswolff's deserted rooms, and Alex Hartley's aspirational interiors concealed by layers of frosted glass. Victoria Miro, Wharf Road, N1 (020-7336 8109) until May 12, free. Jessica Lack Cinema Bridget Jones' Diary Maguire's enjoyable picture finds Helen Fielding's sophisticated creation torn between the sexy cad Daniel (Grant) and the sullen but morally superior human rights barrister Mark Darcy (Firth). (15) (Sharon Maguire, 2001, UK/US) Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, Colin Firth, Hugh Grant. 105 mins *** Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon A martial arts movie in a traditional Chinese action idiom which manages to be both electrifyingly exciting and sweetly romantic. (15) (Ang Lee, 2000, China/US) Chow Yun-Fat, Michelle Yeoh, Zhang Ziyi. 120 mins ***** A Hard Day's Night Easily the best Beatles film, directed by Richard Lester who emerges as a neglected modern master, chucking the camera about with wonderful flair, capturing the sheer joy of the Fab Four in the springtime of their career. His direction is experimental, radical, surreal, suffused with endless invention and fun. And this film is a fascinating picture of the country in 1964, with the Beatles as our cheerfully anarchic heroes. (U) (Richard Lester, 1964, UK) The Beatles, Wilfred Brambell. 87 mins **** Last Resort Pavlikovsky brings rigour, as well as blazing compassion, to this story of an eastern European woman and her young son, washed up in a grim seaside \"holding area\" for asylum seekers. (15) (Paul Pavlikovsky, 2000, UK) Dina Korzun, Paddy Considine, Artyom Strelnikov. 77 mins ***** A One And A Two This spacious family drama is exquisitely considered, richly textured, beautifully acted, moving, funny and wise. A film about the interconnecting tribulations of one extended family in contemporary Taipei, it revolves around a man beset with problems, who meets the person he jilted when she was a schoolgirl 30 years before. (15) (Edward Yang, 2000, Taiwan/Japan) Nien-Jen Wu, Elaine Jin. 173 mins ***** Peter Bradshaw If you're only going to see one thing this week... Mill On The Floss It begins with the ducking of a witch and ends with a flood, and in between you will be swept away by Shared Experience's adaptation of George Eliot's novel. First produced by the company in 1994, Helen Edmundson's version has taken a long time to reach the West End, but it undoubtedly deserves its berth. It is devastatingly good. New Ambassadors, West Street, WC2 (020-7369 1761) 7.30pm, \u00a312.50-\u00a324.",

      "bodyText": "A Palestinian suicide bomber blew himself up in a bus queue during the morning rush hour near Tel Aviv yesterday, killing himself and an Israeli doctor and spraying dozens of commuters with shards of metal and glass. The attack at a bus stop in Kfar Saba, the second fatal suicide bombing in the central Israeli town in a month, came a day after Israel admitted it was holding secret talks with senior Palestinians, and only hours after security officials from the two sides met for the first time since the latest escalation in the seven-month uprising. Previous bombings inside the borders of the Jewish state have overwhelmed attempts to restart negotiations, leading instead to Israeli reprisals. However, the foreign minister, Shimon Peres, said he hoped to continue the talks he has been conducting with the speaker of the Palestinian parliament, Ahmed Queria, or Abu Ala as he is usually known. \"Clearly, the violence makes it more and more difficult,\" Mr Peres told reporters in Jerusalem. \"But we hope to stop the violence not just by exchanges of fire, but also by talking. We will continue to talk despite all the sorrow and agony such attacks create.\" Witnesses said the bomber, who carried a computer case, detonated the explosives as he leaned against a bus pulling into the stop, killing the doctor, who had treated the victims of earlier bombings, and seriously injuring five people, including a schoolboy. \"I won't forget it for all the world,\" one woman on the bus told Israel Radio. \"There was a boy, with his schoolbag still on his back, lying on the ground without moving. There was a pool of blood beside his head, and all I could do was run away, screaming, 'the boy, the boy'.\" Once seen as an up-market community, its industrial parks a magnet for the hi-tech industry, Kfar Saba has become a target of suicide bombers in the last seven months. The town is only a few minutes drive from the West Bank city of Qalqiliya. \"Now, with the situation, you're near all the Arab towns, and it's scary,\" said Eyal Tidhar, aged 18. \"Until now, I thought of myself as living near Tel Aviv. Now I think of how close I live to Qalqiliya.\" There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but the attack comes only a day after the Islamist militant group Hamas renewed its warning that it had enlisted willing volunteers for its campaign of suicide bombings. The bombing could imperil the efforts now underway, with CIA support, to restart joint security co-operation between the Israelis and Palestinians. The hardline prime minister, Ariel Sharon, has been adamant that such talks do not constitute negotiations, in an attempt to appease rightwing allies demanding that he keep to an election promise of a ban on contacts with the Palestinians until they give up their revolt against Israel's occupation in the West Bank and Gaza. In an attempt to shield Mr Sharon from his far-right critics, spokesmen for the prime minister yesterday were swift to blame Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority for the suicide bombing, and to play down the importance of the four-hour security meeting on Saturday night. \"The security meetings were actually good, but they are clearly not enough. What is important is what happens on the ground,\" said Dore Gold, an adviser to Mr Sharon. The last14 10 days have seen a steep climb in violence, defined by Palestinian mortar attacks, and Mr Sharon ordering Israeli invasions of Palestinian-ruled areas in the Gaza Strip. However, there are signs that both sides are trying to find an escape from the pattern of escalation. Mr Peres's secret talks with Abu Ala follow reports that Mr Arafat has offered to join Mr Sharon in making a public appeal against violence. However, in keeping with Mr Sharon's policy of placating the right, Mr Peres yesterday seemed unmoved by Mr Arafat's apparent change of stance. \"Let him make the call. Why not?\" he said.",

      "bodyText": "Pro-independence parties were claiming victory last night in the hotly contested Montenegro election. Early projections suggested that President Milo Djukanovic's Socialist Democratic party (DPS) had won 42% of the vote, enough to give it 35 of the 77 seats. The pro-independence Liberal Alliance party won six seats, according to the projections, enough to give a pro-independence coalition a working majority. Anti-independence parties won 40% of the vote. Official results are not expected until tomorrow. Leader of the opposition \"Together for Yugoslavia\" bloc and president of the Socialist People's party (SNP), Pedrag Bulatovic, indicated soon after polls opened that his supporters might dispute the election results. \"The coalition for Yugoslavia claims that these elections are not fair because the conditions are not the same for all the parties,\" he said after voting in the capital, Podgorica. \"All state institutions were in the service of the DPS and SDP, including the police and media, especially the state media. Considering the irregularities of the election there is huge doubt [about the final results] and there is a great deal of misunderstanding between the two coalitions.\" The election was fought largely on the question of whether or not the small republic of 650,000 people should secede from the Yugoslav federation. Mr Djukanovic's \"Victory belongs to Montenegro\" coalition has pledged to hold a referendum on independence in the summer if it wins. More than 71.2% of the 450,000 registered voters had cast their ballots by 5pm yesterday, observers said. Marko Blagojevic of the Belgrade-based Centre for Free Elections and Democracy (Cesid), whose monitors have observed the polls, said the \"turnout was extremely high\" and could reach 80%, a record for an election in Montenegro. Despite the presence of 3,000 monitors, there were reports of irregularities. Cesid said thousands of voters had been turned away because their names had been spelled wrongly. In the town of Niksic, members of the election board at one polling station were accused of entering polling booths and trying to influence votes. Cesid did not say in whose favour the officials were allegedly acting. The size of any government victory is seen as critical to its drive for independence. While a simple majority would allow the government to hold a referendum, it needs a two-thirds majority in parliament to change the constitution, and to secede from Yugoslavia.. Peter Palmer, an analyst with the International Crisis Group, based in Podgorica, said that a narrow majority might force Mr Djukanovic to seek opposition support for his plans. \"I don't think it would stop the process, but if he falls short of the two-thirds majority, a lot would still be open,\" Mr Palmer said. \"They won't give up their push towards independence and they may attempt to persuade pro-Yugoslav parties to change their minds.\" The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe is expected to announce its verdict on the fairness of the ballot today.",

Washington suspended all its surveillance flights in the area as the incident focused attention on its involvement in similar operations, particularly in Colombia. James and Veronica Bowers, Baptist missionaries from Michigan, their seven-year-old son, Cory, and their baby daughter, Charity, were on a small single-engine Cessna 185 \"floatplane\" when the Peruvian fighter opened fire. The pilot, Kevin Donaldson, also a missionary, was shot in the leg but survived after landing the plane on the Amazon river. The survivors, who were rescued by villagers and returned to the US yesterday. The Peruvian air force has a policy of shooting at planes suspected of carrying drugs if they do not obey instructions and fail to identify themselves. A total of 25 planes have been shot down since the policy was introduced. In 1992 the Perumistakenly shot down a US Air Force C-130 over the Pacific. A US state department official said that an American tracking aircraft was in the area and supplied \"location data\" for the intercept mission. \"It was mistaken for an airplane carrying contraband drugs,\" the spokesman said.

He said the light plane was a mile away from the incident. \"The US crew repeatedly expressed their concern that the nature of the aircraft had not been determined,\" the official told Reuters. He also confirmed that the surveillance plane was part of a US programme to support anti-drug efforts in Peru. The Bowers had been in Peru since 1994, working for the Pennsylvania-based Association of Baptists for World Evangelism. The missionaries' plane was en route to the city of Iquitos, about 600 miles north-east of Lima, when it came under fire, said the Reverend EC Haskell, spokesman for the association. Rev Haskell said that the plane had never left Peruvian air space and strenuously denied claims that the plane had not filed a flight plan. The incident will raise fears of deeper involvement by the US in Colombia where members of the American military are already acting as advisers. The US is taking part in Plan Colombia, officially aimed at tackling drugs, but believed by some to be an effort to defeat leftwing guerrillas. Washington is now under pressure to say exactly what role their plane played. President Bush said the US was helping identify possible drug smugglers by giving Peru's military information such as plane tail numbers, the Associated Press reported. \"Our role was simply to pass on information,\" Mr Bush said. A US embassy official in Lima confirmed that its surveillance planes routinely pass on information about potential drug planes flying through the area bordering Colombia and Brazil, but he declined to say whether on this occasion the US drew the Peruvian air force's attention to the plane.",

Incarcerated in maximum-security prisons, her case was championed by the Italian left which lobbied for a transfer to Italy with a million signatures, demonstrations and parliamentary resolutions. She was flown to Rome in 1999 on the understanding that she would serve nine more years of her sentence but Italian diplomats have sought US approval for an immediate unconditional release on health grounds.

      "body": "<p>When Sandy Mitchell appeared on Saudi television to confess his involvement in bombings and murder, his family and friends said he was drugged - he had been set up by a callous regime.</p> <p>It was an understandable reaction: Mr Mitchell is a kind of fly-guy, a hospitable technician and alcohol bootlegger with friends in high places. He is the sort of man who skates on the edge of trouble, but premeditated murder? Difficult to believe.</p> <p>Mr Mitchell, however, is facing public beheading in the Saudi Arabian capital, Riyadh. As yet he has been charged with nothing. No date has been set for his trial, he has had only limited access to British consular officials, and no Saudi lawyer has been engaged.</p> <p>Yet, publicly at least, the Saudis are taking a hard line. Mr Mitchell and his co-accused - Canadian William Sampson and Belgian Raf Schyvens - have confessed to two car bombings, the endgame of a supposedly bitter feud over the control of illicit alcohol. Under sharia law their penalty is execution and the Saudi interior minister, Prince Nayef, has hinted he believes they should pay the price.</p> <p><b> Explosions continue</b><br></p> <p>But as diplomats juggle Saudi oil and trade interests with the necessity of having their nationals tried or released, doubts are emerging about the feasibility of Mr Mitchell's confession and the alcohol feud story.</p> <p>Although the alleged perpetrators of the Saudi bombing campaign are in prison, explosions have continued, the latest only three weeks ago. British survivors of one bomb attack said they had difficulty believing these men were guilty. A leading Saudi dissident said Islamic fundamentalists, opposed to the influx of westerners and the Saudi royal family's involvement in the illicit alcohol trade, were responsible for the bombings: Mr Mitchell and his co-accused were merely stooges, framed to convey the impression of stability in an oppressive country where Islamic rebellion was growing, albeit in isolated pockets.</p> <p>On December 17 last year, Mr Mitchell, 44, from Kirkintilloch near Glasgow, was arrested in Riyadh for suspected alcohol offences. To the expat community, his involvement in alcohol was an open secret. For a while he had supplemented his income as chief anaesthetic technician at the security forces hospital in Riyadh with a profitable sideline as owner of the Celtic Corner. He had sold the pub a year previously, but still kept a hand in alcohol.</p> <p>In a country where westerners live in compounds, where the boredom is as oppressive as the heat, the habit of selling whisky at \u00a3120 a bottle is difficult to break. Besides, Mr Mitchell counted police officials and members of the Saudi royal family among his friends. He could usually pull a few strings to get himself - and others - out of a scrape.</p> <p>Despite this, things had been getting tough in the alcohol trade. Only a few months earlier, Mr Mitchell had helped his friend, Gary Dixon, owner of the biggest illicit bar in Saudi Arabia, escape across the desert to Dubai.</p> <p>After a crackdown by the mutawwa, the religious police, Mr Dixon's wife, Mary, was already in jail. The jailing had surprised everyone. The expats embroiled in the drinks trade believed the involvement of the royal family left them immune to the mutawwa. \"The main source [of alcohol] is the royal family,\" said Mrs Dixon. \"And the idea of a turf war is ridiculous.\"</p> <p>But alongside the crackdown on alcohol, there were other, more serious, things for westerners to worry about. On November 17, Christopher Rodway, 47, from Salisbury, was killed when a bomb exploded in his car. His wife Jane, 50, narrowly escaped. Five days later, a bomb went off under a British car in Riyadh. No one was killed, but six were injured.</p> <p>Within the expat compounds, rumour spread that westerners were being targeted by Islamic fundamentalists. There was an underground movement within Saudi Arabia prepared to use violence in protest at the influx of westerners and what it saw as the un-Islamic excess of the royal family. The rumour, according to Saad Al-Fagih, of the Movement for Islamic Reform in Arabia, in exile in London, carried more than a hint of veracity.</p> <p>\"There are people, you may call them fundamentalists, who believe in using violence who are behind these bombings,\" he said. \"These groups are too small to attack the big targets, like the American army presence, so they have to [go] for something achievable, a soft target. Hitting westerners will make a big fuss. It will intimidate westerners and embarrass the regime.</p> <p>\"Our sources in the interior ministry tell us that Sandy Mitchell has been arrested only to distract attention from what the regime really believes. Fifty fundamentalists have been arrested since Mitchell.\"</p> <p>Whatever Dr Al-Fagih's sources, Mr Mitchell's confession remains to con demn him. Yet, on analysis, the confession appears tainted.</p> <p>Looking pallid - and almost two months after his arrest - Mr Mitchell told Saudi television: \"I confirm and confess that I was ordered to carry out an explosion here in Riyadh.\" He said he planted a bomb under the driver's seat of the car and Mr Sampson detonated the device by remote control. Neither Mr Mitchell nor the Saudi authorities have revealed who \"ordered\" the explosion.</p> <p><b> The second bombing</b><br></p> <p>Then came his confession to the second bombing. Mr Mitchell said he was talking about the plan for the second attack with Mr Sampson when Mr Schyvens overheard. Bizarrely, Mr Schyvens confessed that he agreed to be recruited into the campaign. But, according to the confessions, Mr Mitchell and Mr Sampson were unsure of Mr Schyvens's commitment.</p> <p>Mr Sampson said he gave Mr Schyvens a dummy device and then telephoned him and told him to plant it on a car owned by a Briton, Steve Coughlan, which was parked outside the Celtic Corner bar. When Mr Schyvens went inside, Mr Sampson said he then planted the real bomb.</p> <p>This scenario does not ring true to survivors of the attack.

      "bodyText": "When Sandy Mitchell appeared on Saudi television to confess his involvement in bombings and murder, his family and friends said he was drugged - he had been set up by a callous regime. It was an understandable reaction: Mr Mitchell is a kind of fly-guy, a hospitable technician and alcohol bootlegger with friends in high places. He is the sort of man who skates on the edge of trouble, but premeditated murder? Difficult to believe. Mr Mitchell, however, is facing public beheading in the Saudi Arabian capital, Riyadh. As yet he has been charged with nothing. No date has been set for his trial, he has had only limited access to British consular officials, and no Saudi lawyer has been engaged. Yet, publicly at least, the Saudis are taking a hard line. Mr Mitchell and his co-accused - Canadian William Sampson and Belgian Raf Schyvens - have confessed to two car bombings, the endgame of a supposedly bitter feud over the control of illicit alcohol. Under sharia law their penalty is execution and the Saudi interior minister, Prince Nayef, has hinted he believes they should pay the price. Explosions continue But as diplomats juggle Saudi oil and trade interests with the necessity of having their nationals tried or released, doubts are emerging about the feasibility of Mr Mitchell's confession and the alcohol feud story. Although the alleged perpetrators of the Saudi bombing campaign are in prison, explosions have continued, the latest only three weeks ago. British survivors of one bomb attack said they had difficulty believing these men were guilty. A leading Saudi dissident said Islamic fundamentalists, opposed to the influx of westerners and the Saudi royal family's involvement in the illicit alcohol trade, were responsible for the bombings: Mr Mitchell and his co-accused were merely stooges, framed to convey the impression of stability in an oppressive country where Islamic rebellion was growing, albeit in isolated pockets. On December 17 last year, Mr Mitchell, 44, from Kirkintilloch near Glasgow, was arrested in Riyadh for suspected alcohol offences. To the expat community, his involvement in alcohol was an open secret. For a while he had supplemented his income as chief anaesthetic technician at the security forces hospital in Riyadh with a profitable sideline as owner of the Celtic Corner. He had sold the pub a year previously, but still kept a hand in alcohol. In a country where westerners live in compounds, where the boredom is as oppressive as the heat, the habit of selling whisky at \u00a3120 a bottle is difficult to break. Besides, Mr Mitchell counted police officials and members of the Saudi royal family among his friends. He could usually pull a few strings to get himself - and others - out of a scrape. Despite this, things had been getting tough in the alcohol trade. Only a few months earlier, Mr Mitchell had helped his friend, Gary Dixon, owner of the biggest illicit bar in Saudi Arabia, escape across the desert to Dubai. After a crackdown by the mutawwa, the religious police, Mr Dixon's wife, Mary, was already in jail. The jailing had surprised everyone. The expats embroiled in the drinks trade believed the involvement of the royal family left them immune to the mutawwa. \"The main source [of alcohol] is the royal family,\" said Mrs Dixon. \"And the idea of a turf war is ridiculous.\" But alongside the crackdown on alcohol, there were other, more serious, things for westerners to worry about. On November 17, Christopher Rodway, 47, from Salisbury, was killed when a bomb exploded in his car. His wife Jane, 50, narrowly escaped. Five days later, a bomb went off under a British car in Riyadh. No one was killed, but six were injured. Within the expat compounds, rumour spread that westerners were being targeted by Islamic fundamentalists. There was an underground movement within Saudi Arabia prepared to use violence in protest at the influx of westerners and what it saw as the un-Islamic excess of the royal family. The rumour, according to Saad Al-Fagih, of the Movement for Islamic Reform in Arabia, in exile in London, carried more than a hint of veracity. \"There are people, you may call them fundamentalists, who believe in using violence who are behind these bombings,\" he said. \"These groups are too small to attack the big targets, like the American army presence, so they have to [go] for something achievable, a soft target. Hitting westerners will make a big fuss. It will intimidate westerners and embarrass the regime. \"Our sources in the interior ministry tell us that Sandy Mitchell has been arrested only to distract attention from what the regime really believes. Fifty fundamentalists have been arrested since Mitchell.\" Whatever Dr Al-Fagih's sources, Mr Mitchell's confession remains to con demn him. Yet, on analysis, the confession appears tainted. Looking pallid - and almost two months after his arrest - Mr Mitchell told Saudi television: \"I confirm and confess that I was ordered to carry out an explosion here in Riyadh.\" He said he planted a bomb under the driver's seat of the car and Mr Sampson detonated the device by remote control. Neither Mr Mitchell nor the Saudi authorities have revealed who \"ordered\" the explosion. The second bombing Then came his confession to the second bombing. Mr Mitchell said he was talking about the plan for the second attack with Mr Sampson when Mr Schyvens overheard. Bizarrely, Mr Schyvens confessed that he agreed to be recruited into the campaign. But, according to the confessions, Mr Mitchell and Mr Sampson were unsure of Mr Schyvens's commitment. Mr Sampson said he gave Mr Schyvens a dummy device and then telephoned him and told him to plant it on a car owned by a Briton, Steve Coughlan, which was parked outside the Celtic Corner bar. When Mr Schyvens went inside, Mr Sampson said he then planted the real bomb. This scenario does not ring true to survivors of the attack. Mr Coughlan said Mr Schyvens was already inside the bar when he arrived and remained there until they left together, so it would have been impossible for him to take the telephone call. Mr Schyvens was part of Mr Coughlan's drinking group and he left in convoy with Mr Coughlan when the group went to another pub. When the bomb exploded, Mr Schyvens offered assistance. \"It doesn't make any sense to me that if you plant a bomb you sit around in a bar, you leave your car parked next to the bomb, you drive off after the bomb, you help the victims, you give your name to police,\" nurse Jackie Gill, a passenger in the bombed car, told BBC Scotland. So if those who admit to being key players in the illicit Saudi alcohol trade - such as Gary and Mary Dixon - rubbish the idea of a turf war, and the confessions do not ring true to the victims of the crime, why would Mr Mitchell, Mr Sampson and Mr Schyvens make them? Stephen Jakobi, of Fair Trials Abroad, said confession was almost the necessary conclusion of any Saudi interrogation. \"We know that the Saudis use relay interrogation until prisoners will confess to virtually anything,\" he said. \"It is only then that the embassy is allowed to see them, by which point it is too late.\" As Mr Mitchell and his co-accused wait in prison, little information is filtering out of Saudi Arabia. If a trial goes ahead, their only hope of escaping execution is the acceptance of a blood money payment by Mr Rodway's family. It would be a convenient scenario, one which would allow everyone to save face. It is almost possible to hear the diplomatic wheels turning.",

Oh, you can have ratings: Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? or a soap will give you that. And respectability is easy enough, although best left to BBC2 or Channel 4. But having both is much harder. Which is why BBC1 is trying so hard for a Morse of its own, and why the bulk of its new drama is crime-based, one way or another. Crime, the thinking goes, can be both popular and clever, so crime plus established stars, such as Ricky Tomlinson and David Suchet, is the current blueprint for BBC1's salvation. </p> <p>Lorraine Heggessey, the channel's controller, desperately needs both the ratings and respectability that crime drama might bring. That ITV has had the cheek to run Dickens adaptations, while BBC1 has been painfully discovering that only a relatively small audience exists for TV versions of mid-20th-century novels, such as Take A Girl Like You, can only have made her dilemma more acute. </p> <p>So with docusoaps out, and a big lurch into Big Brother/Survivor reality TV too risky (except on Saturday night, when any pretence of quality is abandoned), the BBC's thoughts have turned to crime. Drama, having been displaced by the docusoap frenzy a couple of years ago, is back: 20% more of it is promised. </p> <p>New drama cannot be overambitious, though: Clocking Off and The Sins have proved that conceptually smart series are not ratings winners in the current climate. Which leaves those TV staples: cops and docs. BBC1 has its medical warhorses Casualty and Holby City, and a solid crime performer in Silent Witness. Now it wants another crime series (two or three would be better). </p> <p>Holding the fort is the series of one-offs Murder In Mind, with established stars such as Steve McFadden and Kevin Whately. But that can only be a stopgap measure. BBC1 needs a Morse, or at least a big ratings winner such as A Touch Of Frost. The search for a new, long-running crime series began a few weeks ago with the Crime Doubles (two-parters run on Mondays and Tuesdays) which were, with the unhappy exception of Second Sight, reasonably successful. At least two of the shows - NCS and In Deep - will be back. But the channel needs a series that pulls in more than the 7.4 million managed by NCS: Manhunt. </p> <p>The contenders include: Ricky Tomlinson as a private eye (Nice Guy Eddie); Ken Stott (most recently of ITV's The Vice) in the cop-hunts-serial-killer vehicle Messiah: The First Killings; a station-based police drama called Mersey Beat; and - this isn't a joke, they assure us - The Fabulous Bagel Boys, which blends \"investigative policing with the manic hubbub of the local deli\" - Denis Lawson and Michael French star. </p> <p>It is hard to see the new Taggart or Bergerac surfacing out of that lot. Not that it is ever safe to write off shows before they have aired. Morse - with its two-hour running time, impenetrable opening quarter of an hour of each episode and a potentially off-putting central character, did not have the look of a winner either. What is more worrying is the idea that BBC1 is run by people shouting \"Crime! That's the answer!\", in the same way that quiz shows were last year's saviours, and docusoaps before that. Opting for one genre at a time is dangerously reductive thinking. </p> <p>The appeal, though, is understandable. Go into any bookshop and it will be packed with crime novels. Crime drama allows the audience cheap thrills and the reassurance of resolution, with a bit of sociology or the psychology of evil chucked in. There is something familiar about even the tougher detective shows (Prime Suspect, say) that there isn't with drama that doesn't fit in a box, such as Clocking Off. Whether we are talking a noirish private-eye theme or The Bill, there are genre rules that make viewers feel comfortable, and even the programmes that twist them are doing so within a framework. You know where you are with crime. </p> <p>And - maybe because of our tradition of crime novels - it never looks like the tacky option. Even Britain's most down-market crime drama - The Bill - has switched to one-hour episodes to make it clear that it is no soap. With crime drama - especially post-Morse and Poirot - you get production values. Morse, at two hours long, was a useful training ground for directors such as Danny Boyle. The lighting and sets denotes \"quality TV\" even as we watch the first person getting brutally murdered. </p> <p>If BBC1 shouldn't be immersing itself in crime, what are the alternatives? Both TV executives and critics have spent much of the last 10 years looking enviously across the Atlantic. Throughout the 90s, the US TV ratings were dominated by quality sitcoms and ensemble dramas. </p> <p>Recently, due at least partly to British influence, reality shows and quiz shows have made big inroads, but the bulk of peak time is filled with narrative fiction, a surprising percentage of which is either good or at least sharply competent. One key difference is that the networks have fewer shows to commission: seasons run for 22-24 weeks, and when you've added reruns, that is most of the year covered for that time slot. BBC1 could end up needing as many as eight programmes per slot. (The other, inescapable, difference is money.) There have been experiments with longer seasons here, and if one of BBC1's new dramas turns out to be the magic one, giving it a longer run might take some of the headaches out of commissioning. </p> <p>What about sitcoms, though? When the Nine O'Clock News was moved, One Foot In The Grave and The Royle Family were brought in to get the new 9pm slot off to a solid start. However, both shows have ended, and nothing has stepped into their space (ITV is equally short of a big sitcom). The death of the popular British sitcom is a mystery in itself. But Heggessey has the luxury of knowing that sitcoms - like panel games, and quiz shows - can grow up on BBC2 and then make the leap to BBC1 if they show signs of attracting a mass audience. Drama doesn't work the same way. </p> <p>Heggessey thinks her strength is her willingness to shake things up. \"BBC1 is not going to be as slow to change as it has in the past, and we will take some risks. That's very important - if you don't take risks and fail, that's one thing, but at least if you take some risks and fail then you feel better, you can move on to the next thing and try something else.\" </p> <p>What the channel really needs though is time: time to run shows until people can discover them, work out whether they like them or not. For that the BBC needs the backing of Chris Smith (or his successor). The BBC needs the government to make a firm defence of its remit, to tell the Murdoch family that British broadcasting is not and never will be a free market, and the BBC will never be allowed marginalised indulgence for the over-educated along the lines of the US channel PBS. Then BBC1 could work towards building smart populist successes of all genres. Crime is not the answer.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Real IRA is believed to have carried out a grenade attack on a Derry police station over the weekend, as the dissident republican terrorist group continued its violent campaign for a united Ireland by stepping up activity in Ulster and London. Nobody was hurt in Saturday night's blast, which damaged two parked cars outside Strand Road RUC base. Nearby residents were evacuated before the device exploded. Gregory Campbell, a local Democratic Unionist Stormont assemblyman, said those responsible had no regard for anyone who got in the way. \"If they repeatedly do this, then at some point there are going to be people killed or seriously injured,\" he said. \"The security forces must maintain their vigilance.\" The Real IRA marked last week's anniversary of the 1916 Dublin Easter Rising, one of the most important dates in the republican calendar, with a bomb at a post office sorting depot in London. The dissidents, who split from the Provisional IRA in 1997 over opposition to the Good Friday agreement, have a cell in London, which has carried out attacks over the past year, including last month's car bomb outside the BBC. But they are also increasingly active in Derry, where 12 soldiers had a narrow escape in January when a barrack buster bomb partially exploded just a few feet from their sleeping quarters at Ebrington army base. Earlier this month, the Prehen Road in Derry was closed off for three days while experts dealt with a car bomb, and last week security forces made safe a fully primed mortar discovered in Altmore forest, Co Tyrone. However, Sinn Fein's former publicity director, Danny Morrison, writing in yesterday's Observer, claimed the Real IRA would never have the pop ular support to sustain its campaign or achieve its political objectives. \"The Real IRA will never be able to replicate the [Provisional] IRA's firepower and thus bring the British to the negotiating table,\" he said. The Real IRA's alleged leader, Michael McKevitt, is due in court in Dublin tomorrow, to apply for bail in connection with charges of membership of Real IRA and directing terrorism. McKevitt, 51, of Blackrock, Dundalk, Co Louth, in the Irish Republic, is the first person in the republic to face the new charge of directing terrorism, introduced two weeks after the Real IRA bomb killed 29 people in Omagh, Co Tyrone, in August 1998. The charge carries a penalty of life imprisonment. The key witness at his non-jury trial, which will take place at Dublin's special criminal court, is purported to be a US double agent, David Rupert, who provided information on the Real IRA to the FBI, M15 and Irish police, and is now in a witness protection scheme. Irish-American dissidents are thought to be extremely embarrassed that Mr Rupert, 49, an Illinois truck company chief, could infiltrate a secretive terrorist organisation and befriend its top people in less than three years. But Martin Galvin, the New York lawyer who previously raised money for Sinn Fein and now works with the hardline Irish Freedom Committee, has claimed on American radio that Mr Rupert owes hundreds of thousands of dollars to US tax authorities. This could complicate the case against McKevitt as defence lawyers could argue Mr Rupert might have been pressurised into becoming a witness because of his debts. There were similar problems with several \"supergrass\" trials in Northern Ireland in the 1980s, when ex-paramilitaries were persuaded to give evidence against ex-associates.",

A BBC1 series about a double wife - Best Of Both Worlds - was shown two months ago. </p> <p>Guests at this second set of weddings, however, will soon realise that it's a different cover story this time. Whereas Paul Abbot's BBC three-parter featured a woman who moved between two marital homes - a sort of adultery plus - Susan Oudot's two-part drama for ITV focuses on a woman who restricts herself to one husband at a time, but never bothers with the precaution of divorcing his predecessors, or explaining why she's left the marital home. </p> <p>Julie (Michelle Collins), a flirty nurse, is a time-delay version of the Julia Roberts character in The Runaway Bride. But while that woman's problems made her dash from the church on her wedding days, Julie tends to flee from the marital kitchen shortly after the honeymoon. </p> <p>In a twist on Mr Rochester's tactics, Julie keeps her husbands in the attic. When Julie's husband Karl comes home to find his house emptied except for a tier of wedding cake with the model of the groom on it - a trick perhaps more likely to occur to a dramatist than a bigamist - he eventually finds a padlocked box in the loft which contains padded albums of photographs recording marriages to various sailors. But, by then, Julie has already walked out on Karl's replacement Dave - who she tricked into thinking she was pregnant - and is lining up Mike at the top of the aisle. </p> <p>Oudot's script neatly employs the fact that the viewer knows more than the blokes. An unexplained cutaway to a man leaving prison or a previously unseen teenager at a kitchen table suddenly alert us to another part of her past. And, while the BBC series made no attempt to explain the bigamist's behaviour, Perfect finds an answer in childhood. </p> <p>Featuring a runaway, the drama is frequently on foot. Hand-held cameras follow characters as they dash down streets, around supermarkets, along hallways. This isn't new - in fact, the visual signature of current television drama is that people talk while they walk - but there's a distinctive motivation this time. </p> <p>Borrowed from documentary, on-the-trot dialogue is usually used in series - LA Law, ER, The West Wing, Cops - in which the characters are frantically busy, the sprint of the pictures reflecting the speed of their lives. This doesn't apply in Perfect, where Julie spends most of the time sitting around planning another wedding. Here, the dashing chat gives a documentary feel to material that might otherwise seem ridiculous. Bigamy is generally the plot of comedies because, in a time of almost habitual divorce, it seems improbable that someone would tie themselves down twice simultaneously. Making a wedding obsessive seem plausible, Perfect is slick and intelligent popular drama. </p> <p>While producers would like us to sit down with fresh eyes, it's hard to see television shows in isolation. Perfect exists in relation to Best Of Both Worlds, and Simon Nye is now so well-known a writer that his latest sit-com - The Savages - seems to complete an unofficial trilogy after Men Behaving Badly and How Do You Want Me? </p> <p>The first show featured the courting rituals of the unmarried young; the second the manoeuvres of young marrieds, leaving London to discover the sinister truth about rural life. None of the couples in these comedies were troubled by children. Now The Savages deals with middle-class married life with small babies. Adam (Marcus Brigstocke) and Jessica (Victoria Hamilton) are recognisable young parents: yawning, bickering, interviewing au pairs. </p> <p>The presence of Geoffrey Palmer as a grandad commandeered for childcare connects the series with the past of sit-com but also reminds us of how thin in young children that history is. With the exception of the labour ward episode in Only Fools And Horses, most comedy characters - such as Palmer's dentist in Butterflies - have had grown-up children or none at all. </p> <p>That's probably no accident. The problems that offspring bring in real life - making it hard to go out, dominating the conversation, inducing brain-death through exhaustion - are equally handicaps in drama.

Promising signs, though, are a series of classy visual gags including an original act of marital revenge - putting your husband's filofax through a blender - and a pay-off involving a cuddly toy bought as a peace gift for a wife.

From where did the horse go missing? Was it ever found? Had it been dismembered? Did it stage its own disappearance to leave behind pantomime and ridicule and instead embark upon a life in serious theatre? Alas, we'll never know, for Edward (David Suchet) was much more concerned with the story headlined \"YOUTH STABBED IN ALLEY\", as you would be if you had knifed the said youth in the said alley. </p> <p>While not quite relying on the Shaggy defence (\"It wasn't me\"), he hadn't meant to do it. As buttoned up as Ann Widdecombe's bloomers, this teacher had simply gone for a walk on a common, met a young man and given in to his repressed homosexual desires. After the junkie rent boy turned on him (and not in a good way), David accidentally stabbed him and scooted off - but not without being seen by the Branston estate's neighbourhood watch. And all this after an impressive six minutes, an indication of the pace and economy of this delicious and riveting story. </p> <p>In a pickle after his encounter on the Branston estate, poor middle-class Edward was in turmoil when another horrible junkie - wearing the regulation scraggy jumper and hooded top they hand out at needle exchanges along with syringes - started to blackmail him, having found his credit card at the crime scene. So Edward did what any sane bloke would do. He tried to kill himself. On a day when his daughter was coming round to visit. Timing, it seems, wasn't his greatest forte. </p> <p>It helped that his daughter was a nurse. Not so that she could help him recover from his carbon monoxide poisoning, but so she could also come over all murderous and calculating and organise the demise of his blackmailer. </p> <p>Catrin (Gillian Kearney) was determined not to see her father vilified in the papers in the same way as her dead mother had been (\"Doped Up Doctor In M1 Horror\") and so set about nicking drugs from the hospital, tailing the bad junkie and plotting to inject him with methadone and diazepam. Now that's something you'd see in Where The Heart Is. </p> <p>But in a twist in this tale, which was blissfully reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock Presents and Tales Of The Unexpected, her dad stopped her with his decision to confess. Not one for giving up - the woman gave enemas for a living, remember - she persevered and immolated the bad junkie on his stinky mattress, but not before planting the murder weapon in his squat. </p> <p>With the bad - and now crispy - junkie blamed for junkie rent boy's murder, they all lived happily ever after. Well, not exactly. Wracked with guilt, Edward returned to his car and suffocated himself with exhaust fumes once more (but at least Catrin would get the house in the will). Edward's involvement in the disappearance of the pantomime horse, however, will remain forever mysterious. </p> <p>The morals of Murder In Mind seem pretty straightforward. </p> <p>1) Don't mess with civil servants of any kind or they are liable to stab and/or fry you to death. (David Blunkett, take note.) </p> <p>2) If you're an aspiring murderer, make sure it's the night before bin day so the dustbin men can dispose of your bloody clothes. </p> <p>3) If you're going to kill someone, try and make sure that they are either a junkie or a prostitute or, ideally, both.

Just as I did, the writer's presence on the city streets attracted unwanted attention, snide remarks and glances - in my case because I was in a get-up that was out-of-time by more than a century; in Dickens' case because it was the middle of the night. </p> <p>But the writer had a lot on his mind, and this was the imaginative starting point for Mike Dorrell's play about Dickens's troubled marriage to his wife of 20 years, Catherine, as he falls in love with the 18-year-old actress Ellen Ternan. Nothing new there, you might be thinking, but Dorrell told his story with deft, innovative touches - the perfect prelude to the new five-part serial of Little Dorrit that began yesterday. </p> <p>As Dickens walks along the dark streets, his own story unravels as he passes the settings for his novels; fictional scenes collide with childhood memories. Shady characters of the night shadow him (\"it's only us, the voices of London, what have made you rich and famous\"), sounding like John Lydon, Billy from EastEnders and Denise Van Outen. You wouldn't want them as company on your long journey of existential terror, asking the big questions (\"why would a man like 'im frequent cemeteries and morgues and knackers' yards?\") and reminding you of your lowly origins. </p> <p>Siobhan Redmond played Georgina, Dickens's sister-in-law, and their house-keeper, a woman constrained by convention (she offers to get a doctor's letter to prove her virginity when there are rumours about her relationship with Dickens), but also strong enough to resist the languish-on-a-sofa-suffering-from-nerves response her sister takes to life. Fair enough, you might think, after 10 children in 10 years, several miscarriages, two treatments of laudanum and marriage to a genius with a wandering eye, but it's Georgina that we - and Dickens - prefer. </p> <p>How different it might all have been had the long-suffering Catherine lived half-a-century later in Bourneville, the village that George Cadbury built for his workers and the subject of this week's <strong> Beautiful Visions</strong> (Radio 4). Cadbury's guidelines for a healthy life included bee-keeping, a cold bath each morning, and never brewing tea for more than three minutes.</p>",

Despite a double fistful of honorary titles, such as the Keeper of the Great Seal of Scotland, and an active business life, he succeeded in cultivating new obscurity, partly by staying away from the House of Lords, where he took the Conservative whip.</p> <p>This was normal for a man who retained 81,000 of the family's acres, spread over much of Argyll, reduced from the 175,000 held in 1877. He sold the island of Iona in 1979 to pay off family death duties.

      "bodyText": "The multilingual 12th Duke of Argyll, who has died of heart failure during surgery aged 63, always said he wanted to keep \"a low profile behind my ramparts\" at Inveraray Castle. Despite a double fistful of honorary titles, such as the Keeper of the Great Seal of Scotland, and an active business life, he succeeded in cultivating new obscurity, partly by staying away from the House of Lords, where he took the Conservative whip. This was normal for a man who retained 81,000 of the family's acres, spread over much of Argyll, reduced from the 175,000 held in 1877. He sold the island of Iona in 1979 to pay off family death duties. When Inveraray Castle, his 90-room 18th-century family home overlooking Loch Fyne, was badly damaged by fire in 1975, he made a public appeal to the clan Campbell, which he headed, to finance its restoration. When, shortly thereafter, he was revealed as one of Britain's richest men with a fortune of \u00a387m, lots of contributors asked for their money back. He rebuilt his family fortune by such things as charging tourists \u00a31,000 a week to stalk deer at Inveraray. He also charged the Japanese \u00a3245 a bottle for his 21-year-old Highland single malt whisky.

      "body": "<b>Tor Docherty, 25</b> A helpline manager for Cruse Bereavement Care. <p>I have always enjoyed being single but recently I've realised that I would actually quite like not to be any more. I'd like to have someone I can come home to, someone to snuggle up to. It's the soppy side of things I'm after. Often I go places and it's a little bit coupley which makes me feel I'd like to have that, too. I'm not exactly pining or actively searching but by the time I'm 35 I would like to have children with another woman, which means probably being in a relationship by the time I'm 30. </p> <p>Gay life operates around \"the scene\" which takes place in clubs and pubs, but I'm not into that. I look miserable in a club and am not very approachable. So I rely on meeting people through friends. Of course there are fewer choices like this, but there are fewer anyway if you're gay. If you accept the statistic that 10% of people are gay, that means 90% aren't interested even before you begin. Unlike heterosexuals, you can't assume most people are like you, so the chance of my meeting someone at work, for example, is slim. </p> <p>If I bump into someone I quite fancy in the street, before I can even think whether she fancies me back, I have to ask myself: \"Is she gay?\" So I always have to jump that hurdle first. I've met bits of the right person but I want them all rolled into one. </p> <p>Over the past couple of years, I've come out to more or less everyone (thanks to having friends and a supportive family), though obviously each time I go into a new situation I have to begin all over again. I don't think being out makes meeting someone any easier but it does mean that at least everyone knows the kind of person I'm interested in. </p> <p>A couple of years ago, I placed an ad in a newspaper with a gay friend. He wrote my ad and I wrote his - it seemed easier to be honest that way. I remember he said something about my loving life, which people responded to. I didn't follow up any of the replies because at the time it was just a bit of fun, but if I'm still searching in the future, I wouldn't rule out doing it more seriously. </p> <p>My social life revolves around my friends, who are mostly gay men and lesbians, plus some straight women. We get together for dinner and recently I went on a girlie weekend to Europe. We hired an apartment and did a few cultural things, as well as a few drunken things! </p> <p>What with my friends and my work, my life is extremely full and I know if I had a relationship I'd have to make space for it. Living alone makes you a bit selfish and I'd have to adjust. What I like about being single is the irresponsibility of it. I can do whatever I want, when I want. I don't have to ring anyone to say I'm not coming home. Not having to negotiate things with someone is great. But if I met the right person I'd be willing to sacrifice all that. </p> <p><b>Carol Slesser, 50</b> An executive coach working in career and confidence building. </p> <p>Single women my age are in a strong position these days because there are a lot of men out there: widowers, divorced men and people like me who've never married. My main place for meeting new people is at ceroc nights. Ceroc is a blend of jive and salsa, and what's great about it is that there are always more men than women. It's also acceptable for women to ask men to dance. </p> <p>I adore it. Usually I try things and get bored but not with ceroc. It's fun, it's good for the soul and it's somewhere you can go on your own and not be dependent on anyone - 81% of people who do ceroc are single. </p> <p>In the past I've tried dinner clubs but they were expensive and felt like cattle markets. Ceroc is an interest, not a club, and a place where you meet real quality people such as lawyers, lecturers and surgeons. </p> <p>Once or twice I've tried advertising in papers, too, but that's never worked. Even if you specify that you don't want anyone married, married men still answer, saying they're alone in town during the week. I hate pubs and clubs, and at this stage of my life I'd never go there to pick someone up. </p> <p>When you get over 35, the internet is a very acceptable way of meeting men and I like the fact that you're in control. If someone emails me with their number, I always call them first so I can hear what their voice sounds like. It's the best way of sifting through the replies. I've met some very interesting people through the internet - usually professional and middle-income - but I've never actually had a relationship with someone. </p> <p>Last year I met a lovely 50-year-old man with his own business who was a wonderful person but just not for me, so I introduced him to a friend instead. I went to their wedding last month. Being single can be a bit like pass the parcel! </p> <p>I've been on solo holidays, too, which are ideal if you don't want to go away on your own, but they've never led to a relationship because the women are usually of a higher calibre than the men. I also go to the opera and ballet, and I like entertaining my friends. Sometimes I go on courses, too. The other day I went on a fabulous one about happiness and laughter. </p> <p>I've had a number of serious relationships in my life and a couple that have lasted a little over three years. Although I'm single now, for the first time in my life I've got a number of male friends. They are all people I've had relationships with but have now become good friends which is lovely. </p> <p>I've reached a stage and an age at which I'm not desperately seeking a relationship. It'll happen if it happens. But I'm not like a lot of my friends who have given up and can't be bothered any more. I don't believe someone will come knocking on the door. In business, as well as socially, you've got to make your own map in this world. </p> <p><b>Christina Sesay, 40s</b> A bridalwear designer who makes and sells individual dresses.</p> <p>When I was a few years younger, I would go out with the express intention of meeting people, but now I go out to be with my friends and to have a good time. I go to bars or for meals in people's houses, and I go to the gym. I don't like being at home too many nights in a row: home is somewhere to come back to. </p> <p>About once every two weeks I go dancing at a soul and funk club. It's full of people my age who go there because they enjoy the music, not because they're off their heads on drugs. I don't necessarily go to chat or pick someone up, though it can happen. </p> <p>I advertised to meet someone once but it was a jokey thing I did with a girlfriend. We even had men who were married answering the ad. My guess is that it's the same group of guys doing the rounds. We arranged to meet two of them but either they didn't turn up or they were the two old men in the corner who had lied about their age! I wouldn't do it again. </p> <p>It's dreadful if people start to get hysterical about being single. I heard of one woman once who was invited to a dinner party with only couples and when she realised, she got up and walked out. A good meal would not make me leave the table! </p> <p>The trouble is, you don't meet men when you design bridalwear. I sometimes wonder if that's the reason why I'm still single - a lot of people meet their partners through work, after all. </p> <p>When I hit my mid-30s, a strong maternal urge took hold of me and I really wanted to get married and to have a baby - but it wasn't to be. It made me a bit hysterical for a while but once I had come to terms with it, I just got on with my life and thought about getting a dog instead. </p> <p>I've never been married and I've never lived with anyone but I have had plenty of relationships, so if I'm honest there must be a part of me that is frightened of commitment. My predicament is that I meet men who are younger than me. It's fine to start with but the problem comes when you want something more serious and they're not ready. </p> <p>It's not that I don't like men - I think I like men better the older I get because I'm not trying to make a man like a girlfriend any more. Recently I've been much more comfortable about myself and I've stopped wondering when Mr Perfect will turn up. </p> <p>I've had many relationships over the years and enjoyed all of them. I believe that as a woman gets older, she should have a good sex life because it holds back the menopause. In some ways I feel really lucky being single because it means I've had the longest youth you can imagine. </p> <p><b>Lesley Leigh, 34</b> In the second year of a complementary therapies degree. </p> <p>I have never gone out searching for a partner. I've seen too many people standing there with a big neon sign over their head and a desperate look on their face. It frightens the life out of me and I've vowed I'll never be like that. I find the idea of dinner clubs, ads and dating agencies all rather amusing. It's fine for other people but it's not the level I work at. </p> <p>Although I'm not out looking for someone, it doesn't mean I lead a boring life. I have a lot of good friends and try to do loads of different things. Diversity is the spice of life. </p> <p>I'd like a relationship, but I can't be doing with mind games any more. The will-he-won't-he aspect of a relationship can really knock your confidence. I want someone who is comfortable and open with me. </p> <p>I have an 11-year-old daughter and obviously having a child makes a difference. If I were in a relationship, the man would have to take Kady on board, too. If he didn't like children it wouldn't go anywhere because she is part and parcel of who I am. </p> <p>I have one very good male friend I used to go out with all the time, until he moved up north. Now I only see him a couple of times a month and I miss him a lot. We're as close as two friends can be and tend to do what most couples do - go to pubs, clubs and cinemas. There's an element of safety when you've got a man with you. We have this thing, too, where he'll point out someone and say \"He's attractive\" or \"He's watching you\" and I'll do the same to him about a woman. </p> <p>I have a network of close and reliable friends. We all go out in a group, but recently it's got a bit boring going to the same pub all the time, so now we try to organise something different each time. It's nice if someone new comes along as it adds a bit of spice. </p> <p>I don't usually get lonely, but sometimes I can feel a bit sorry for myself if I haven't organised something to do or I've had one of those days that starts out on a high and ends on a low. The sort of day you just want someone to come home to. </p> <p>I used to go to the West End a lot with my friend but it doesn't have such a pull any more. Everyone seems to be getting younger and I think to myself: \"I was like that 10 years ago.\" Part of me would like to be like that again but the mature side of me says: \"You've done that and you didn't really enjoy it, so what makes you think 12 years later it'll be any better?\" </p> <p>I don't like going to pubs where there are only people in their 20s. A few months ago a 22-year-old chap got chatting to me and he found it very hard to comprehend that a 33-year-old woman with an 11-year-old child might be there just to have a dance and not be out looking for someone. </p> <p>I'm quite surprised I've been single for five years, but I certainly don't mind. It suits my life at the moment and I'm not stressed about meeting someone. If it happens, it happens.</p>",

It's fun, it's good for the soul and it's somewhere you can go on your own and not be dependent on anyone - 81% of people who do ceroc are single. In the past I've tried dinner clubs but they were expensive and felt like cattle markets. Ceroc is an interest, not a club, and a place where you meet real quality people such as lawyers, lecturers and surgeons. Once or twice I've tried advertising in papers, too, but that's never worked. Even if you specify that you don't want anyone married, married men still answer, saying they're alone in town during the week. I hate pubs and clubs, and at this stage of my life I'd never go there to pick someone up. When you get over 35, the internet is a very acceptable way of meeting men and I like the fact that you're in control. If someone emails me with their number, I always call them first so I can hear what their voice sounds like. It's the best way of sifting through the replies. I've met some very interesting people through the internet - usually professional and middle-income - but I've never actually had a relationship with someone. Last year I met a lovely 50-year-old man with his own business who was a wonderful person but just not for me, so I introduced him to a friend instead. I went to their wedding last month. Being single can be a bit like pass the parcel! I've been on solo holidays, too, which are ideal if you don't want to go away on your own, but they've never led to a relationship because the women are usually of a higher calibre than the men. I also go to the opera and ballet, and I like entertaining my friends. Sometimes I go on courses, too. The other day I went on a fabulous one about happiness and laughter. I've had a number of serious relationships in my life and a couple that have lasted a little over three years. Although I'm single now, for the first time in my life I've got a number of male friends. They are all people I've had relationships with but have now become good friends which is lovely. I've reached a stage and an age at which I'm not desperately seeking a relationship. It'll happen if it happens. But I'm not like a lot of my friends who have given up and can't be bothered any more. I don't believe someone will come knocking on the door. In business, as well as socially, you've got to make your own map in this world. Christina Sesay, 40s A bridalwear designer who makes and sells individual dresses. When I was a few years younger, I would go out with the express intention of meeting people, but now I go out to be with my friends and to have a good time. I go to bars or for meals in people's houses, and I go to the gym. I don't like being at home too many nights in a row: home is somewhere to come back to. About once every two weeks I go dancing at a soul and funk club. It's full of people my age who go there because they enjoy the music, not because they're off their heads on drugs. I don't necessarily go to chat or pick someone up, though it can happen. I advertised to meet someone once but it was a jokey thing I did with a girlfriend. We even had men who were married answering the ad. My guess is that it's the same group of guys doing the rounds. We arranged to meet two of them but either they didn't turn up or they were the two old men in the corner who had lied about their age! I wouldn't do it again. It's dreadful if people start to get hysterical about being single. I heard of one woman once who was invited to a dinner party with only couples and when she realised, she got up and walked out. A good meal would not make me leave the table! The trouble is, you don't meet men when you design bridalwear. I sometimes wonder if that's the reason why I'm still single - a lot of people meet their partners through work, after all. When I hit my mid-30s, a strong maternal urge took hold of me and I really wanted to get married and to have a baby - but it wasn't to be. It made me a bit hysterical for a while but once I had come to terms with it, I just got on with my life and thought about getting a dog instead. I've never been married and I've never lived with anyone but I have had plenty of relationships, so if I'm honest there must be a part of me that is frightened of commitment. My predicament is that I meet men who are younger than me. It's fine to start with but the problem comes when you want something more serious and they're not ready. It's not that I don't like men - I think I like men better the older I get because I'm not trying to make a man like a girlfriend any more. Recently I've been much more comfortable about myself and I've stopped wondering when Mr Perfect will turn up. I've had many relationships over the years and enjoyed all of them. I believe that as a woman gets older, she should have a good sex life because it holds back the menopause. In some ways I feel really lucky being single because it means I've had the longest youth you can imagine. Lesley Leigh, 34 In the second year of a complementary therapies degree. I have never gone out searching for a partner. I've seen too many people standing there with a big neon sign over their head and a desperate look on their face. It frightens the life out of me and I've vowed I'll never be like that. I find the idea of dinner clubs, ads and dating agencies all rather amusing. It's fine for other people but it's not the level I work at. Although I'm not out looking for someone, it doesn't mean I lead a boring life. I have a lot of good friends and try to do loads of different things. Diversity is the spice of life. I'd like a relationship, but I can't be doing with mind games any more. The will-he-won't-he aspect of a relationship can really knock your confidence. I want someone who is comfortable and open with me. I have an 11-year-old daughter and obviously having a child makes a difference. If I were in a relationship, the man would have to take Kady on board, too. If he didn't like children it wouldn't go anywhere because she is part and parcel of who I am. I have one very good male friend I used to go out with all the time, until he moved up north. Now I only see him a couple of times a month and I miss him a lot. We're as close as two friends can be and tend to do what most couples do - go to pubs, clubs and cinemas. There's an element of safety when you've got a man with you. We have this thing, too, where he'll point out someone and say \"He's attractive\" or \"He's watching you\" and I'll do the same to him about a woman. I have a network of close and reliable friends. We all go out in a group, but recently it's got a bit boring going to the same pub all the time, so now we try to organise something different each time. It's nice if someone new comes along as it adds a bit of spice. I don't usually get lonely, but sometimes I can feel a bit sorry for myself if I haven't organised something to do or I've had one of those days that starts out on a high and ends on a low. The sort of day you just want someone to come home to. I used to go to the West End a lot with my friend but it doesn't have such a pull any more. Everyone seems to be getting younger and I think to myself: \"I was like that 10 years ago.\" Part of me would like to be like that again but the mature side of me says: \"You've done that and you didn't really enjoy it, so what makes you think 12 years later it'll be any better?\" I don't like going to pubs where there are only people in their 20s. A few months ago a 22-year-old chap got chatting to me and he found it very hard to comprehend that a 33-year-old woman with an 11-year-old child might be there just to have a dance and not be out looking for someone. I'm quite surprised I've been single for five years, but I certainly don't mind. It suits my life at the moment and I'm not stressed about meeting someone. If it happens, it happens.",

Dominic Kelly Carnforth, Lancs dominicjk@onetel.net.uk \u0095 \"The idea that trade is intrinsically bad is nonsense, and dangerous nonsense at that,\" your leader says. Trade is, in effect, the oil-powered movement of goods over long distances. So a growth in trade inevitably fuels the buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, with its attendant impact on the climate. Oil is a finite resource and any oil-fuelled international trade regime can expect to have only a limited lifespan. Given that both climate change and the likely increase in the price of oil point to transporting fewer goods shorter distances, a move away from a trade-based economy to one oriented towards greater self-sufficiency makes a great deal of sense. Given some of the extraordinarily anti-democratic decisions that have been made by the WTO and Gatt in recent years, you ought to be accusing them of spouting \"dangerous nonsense\".

The small scale is surprising, but then this part of London is a grid of narrow low-lying, 18th-century streets, packed with incident; it needs a tall building like it needs another sex shop. What's more surprising, at first, is the organisation that is making this pint-size Pompidou its home - the Ford Motor Company, which has decided to locate its latest design studio and research centre in central London. </p> <p>Soho, meanwhile, has been fighting a battle with cars for many years. Banning them feels wrong, for the sheer bustle of the place is what gives Soho much of its character; yet there are always too many drivers fighting their way around Soho Square at night, looking for precious parking spaces. If drivers are sensible, they will be at the wheels of the latest generation of chic and tiny city cars, which is the sort of vehicle towards which Ford's design studio - under the direction of J Mays, the corporation's vice-president of design - has been working in recent years. </p> <p>Two years ago Mays unveiled the 021C by the UK-based Australian Marc Newson. It is a bright orange bubble of a car that showed that Ford is not just the maker of Fiestas and Mondeos. In fact, since the 1960s and beneath its ever-so-sensible surface, Ford has been sporadically enthusiastic about new car design and technology. One of the greatest and best looking sports-racing cars of all times, the Le Mans-devouring GT40, was a Ford. </p> <p>Ford has also been a patron of radical architecture. It created some of the first mass-production factory lines and built a number of extremely impressive plants, notably those designed by Albert Kahn around the time of the first world war. Not long after, Kahn was invited by Stalin to design and build hundreds of factories for the fast-industrialising Soviet Union. In office architecture, too, Ford took a lead in 1964 with the Ford Foun dation building in New York by Kevin Roche. This striking building set the pace for a generation of office buildings organised around winter-garden-style atria. </p> <p>In other words, despite all the jokes about Mondeo man, Ford can be innovative. Now, in order to expose its designers to new trends, the company wants to bring its latest studio into the heart of London, instead of tucking away its creatives in a factory miles out of town, as it has in the past. Rogers and his team have also long celebrated the world of new technology in their colourful, adventurous and futuristic work. </p> <p>Ford did not commission the Soho building. It began life as a \u00a37m speculative office block commissioned by Derwent Valley Holdings and designed under the direction of John Young of Richard Rogers. The interior of this light and airy building has been fitted out by a team led by Adrian Caddy of the design practice Imagination, which has worked with Ford for many years on motor-show displays. Caddy explains that, when it opens later this year, the building will also have an art and design gallery open to the public, partly modelled on the ICA. There will be film screenings, seminars and lectures, some of which - but not all - will have a connection with cars. The ground floor of the building will be a design shop, and the basement is to house a public restaurant. </p> <p>This permeability - the fact that the public will be invited into the domain of a normally secretive global corporation - is part and parcel of the Richard Rogers design credo. But it also suggests that at least one global corporation has begun to recognise the need to be more transparent itself, and to listen to consumers' views. </p> <p>As for the building, it is an astute buy. At various times in the past century, a few manufacturing companies have learned that matching their product and image to distinguished architecture could only enhance their image. This trend started with some striking 19th-century factories, but began its modern ascent with the noble AEG factory (1908), designed by Peter Behrens, in whose Berlin studio both Le Corbusier and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, the greatest architects of the 20th century, worked. AEG's fine industrial and domestic products were seen to emerge not from some smoky factory, but from a 20th-century reworking of a Greek temple. </p> <p>The idea was not lost on Mies van der Rohe, whose stunning Seagram Building (1958) on New York's Park Avenue, and its equally stunning public restaurant, the Four Seasons, have associated the whisky brand with the utmost quality for the past 40 years. Norman Foster's bespoke headquarters for the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank (1986) in Hong Kong was a huge profile-raiser (for client and architect alike), as was Rogers's own Lloyd's Building (1986) in the City of London. </p> <p>The Rogers Ford building animates a street corner, opens what in other hands might have been just another private building to the public and demonstrates how the pop thrills of the Pompidou Centre and Bladerunner bombast of Lloyd's can be happily scaled down. But, I wonder, what will Mondeo man make of it? </p> <p><strong>Wonders and blunders</strong><br></p> <p><strong> Wonder:</strong> Millennium Bridge, Gateshead <br><strong>Blunder:</strong> Motorway bridges<br> </p> <p> I think bridges, when they are properly designed, epitomise perfect structure. The wonderful thing about them is that they are very pure structures. When that purity is put into play, as it is in the original Severn Bridge or Chris Wilkinson's Gateshead Millennium Bridge, the results are extraordinary. </p> <p>I think it is interesting to look back to the time of Isambard Kingdom Brunel, when the most beautiful bridges were built, and compare those structures with those being produced today. There was an incredible beauty in the bridges that Brunel designed, such as the wonderfully engineered railway bridge at Maidenhead. </p> <p>Some of the new architect-designed bridges in Britain are amazing. The Gateshead Millennium Bridge, which was swung into position recently, is a perfect example. I like the fact that it does not have a straight arch and the shape is oblique. It is a beautiful structure; I love the way you can see exactly how it holds itself up. </p> <p>What I find appalling are the numerous awful bridges built over motorways in Britain. It is extraordinary that we have been building motorways for the past 30 years and no one has yet designed a decent or elegant bridge for them. Because they tend to lack an arch, they do not even look like bridges and, instead, often seem as if they cannot hold themselves up. </p> <p>They just look like awkward sticks of concrete put together with an awful, slightly curved beam that goes across the motorway like a ledge. It is a shame that our motorway bridges suggest such a lack of care and interest. They show no love for design or engineering and express nothing except their own ugliness. </p> <p><strong>James Dyson</strong></p> <p>\u0095 James Dyson is a designer and inventor.</p>",

Norman Foster's bespoke headquarters for the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank (1986) in Hong Kong was a huge profile-raiser (for client and architect alike), as was Rogers's own Lloyd's Building (1986) in the City of London. The Rogers Ford building animates a street corner, opens what in other hands might have been just another private building to the public and demonstrates how the pop thrills of the Pompidou Centre and Bladerunner bombast of Lloyd's can be happily scaled down. But, I wonder, what will Mondeo man make of it? Wonders and blunders Wonder: Millennium Bridge, Gateshead Blunder: Motorway bridges I think bridges, when they are properly designed, epitomise perfect structure. The wonderful thing about them is that they are very pure structures. When that purity is put into play, as it is in the original Severn Bridge or Chris Wilkinson's Gateshead Millennium Bridge, the results are extraordinary. I think it is interesting to look back to the time of Isambard Kingdom Brunel, when the most beautiful bridges were built, and compare those structures with those being produced today. There was an incredible beauty in the bridges that Brunel designed, such as the wonderfully engineered railway bridge at Maidenhead. Some of the new architect-designed bridges in Britain are amazing. The Gateshead Millennium Bridge, which was swung into position recently, is a perfect example. I like the fact that it does not have a straight arch and the shape is oblique. It is a beautiful structure; I love the way you can see exactly how it holds itself up. What I find appalling are the numerous awful bridges built over motorways in Britain. It is extraordinary that we have been building motorways for the past 30 years and no one has yet designed a decent or elegant bridge for them. Because they tend to lack an arch, they do not even look like bridges and, instead, often seem as if they cannot hold themselves up. They just look like awkward sticks of concrete put together with an awful, slightly curved beam that goes across the motorway like a ledge. It is a shame that our motorway bridges suggest such a lack of care and interest. They show no love for design or engineering and express nothing except their own ugliness.

Some reports declared that the paintings, Shade and Darkness: Evening of the Deluge, and Light and Colour: Morning after the Deluge, would be relinquished by Serbs linked to Arkan, the assassinated warlord. Rumours in the art world suggested German criminals, fed up with failing to sell two such recognisable works, were looking to cut a deal with the Tate Gallery, which owned them before they were stolen from the Schirn Kunsthalle in Frankfurt, where they were being exhibited on loan. The Guardian can reveal that the phone call the Tate had been hoping and waiting for since July 1994 finally came a few weeks ago. Detectives in Belgium announced they had arrested two men in a sting operation in Antwerp. The pair had been touting the Tate's two stolen Turners, painted in 1843, to a private investigator, believing he was an art dealer who could secure them a reward. The canvases, which had been insured for \u00a324m, had been recovered undamaged. To the police, they looked like the genuine articles.

Sunderland, too, are cursing a sequence of one win in 12 that has scuppered their hopes of Europe. Man of the match: Julio Arca (Sunderland).",

Now they've all played over 60. \"Experience tells. And the arrival of Duncan Fletcher has helped. He's an outstanding coach.\" </p> <p>In what way? </p> <p>\"Well, when I say that, it slightly goes against my thoughts on the game. I feel the responsibility is on the players to perform. I feel there are a number of cricketers around who use the coach as a crutch to lean on, an excuse for their own failings. But what Fletcher has is a calmness.

      "body": "<p>\"Badgers!\" exclaims a road sign on the approaches to Yeovil, promising a new charm to the League map if the Glovers go up. But the draw with their fellow contenders left the situation anything but black and white. Rushden are three points clear; Yeovil have a game in hand. Rushden have the better goal difference; Yeovil have four to play. Neither have irresistible form. Both play tomorrow. </p> <p>This is the third year running the fixture list has thrown up a Conference summit in April and the first one Rushden have not lost. Cheltenham scored two in the last minute in 1999 to turn 0-1 into 2-1. Kidderminster beat them 2-0 last year. This time Rushden have emerged with their fate in their own hands. </p> <p>Their manager Brian Talbot said: \"There's still a lot to do and no one lays down for us.\" No one does as the feeling persists that the \u00a320m backing of Max Griggs, the man behind Dr Marten's, has tilted the playing field as Mohamed Al Fayed has at Fulham. Opponents try that bit harder. </p> <p>\"All I keep hearing is what a waste of money,\" said Talbot and the Yeovil fans had their chanting say after a rendering of Drink Up Thy Cider. But this season Rushden have spent nothing on transfers, reinforcing their ranks with \"frees\" and the youth system. They have a set-up fit for the League and, as Yeovil's Colin Addison said, \"they're three years down the road on us. If we don't do it now, it won't be failure.\" </p> <p>Yeovil, who also breed their own, got into the Conference only in 1998 and are still completing their ground after moving from the old Huish in 1990. They are not ones to talk of level playing fields. But the slope was well remembered in a minute's silence for Alec Stock, manager of the club's most romantic moments. They may be hard to match in the new trading estate. </p> <p>The mass of green and white, which helped lift the ground's crowd record to 8,868, willed a reprise of Celtic celebrations but it was not to be. On a cherry-blossom day there was little polish. The prize was greater than the poise. Anxiety ruled. </p> <p>The first half was played largely in the air. Much of the second took in the whole estate. Everyone buzzed with energy, few with purpose. Last week scientists revealed that bees can think. They might look into footballers next. But neither side needed to prove their credentials. </p> <p>Yeovil extended a history of Cup glories at Blackpool this year. At one time they were nine points clear of Rushden, who lost the next two games after Yeovil beat them in November but have since lost one in 19. Diamonds are forever coming. They should arrive on May 5. </p> <p>Each manager praised his own positive approach. Yeovil's Darren Way and Rushden's Andrew Burgess stood out in midfield. Tony Pennock tipped over Duane Darby's point-blank header and, in a final siege by Yeovil, with the centre- back Terry Skiverton thrown forward, Tom White saw his bullet blocked by Billy Turley. </p> <p>The old ground is a supermarket now - no doubt with all the grapefruits down in one corner. The climax would have been even better there - a breathless close at the Huish.</p>",

      "bodyText": "\"Badgers!\" exclaims a road sign on the approaches to Yeovil, promising a new charm to the League map if the Glovers go up. But the draw with their fellow contenders left the situation anything but black and white. Rushden are three points clear; Yeovil have a game in hand. Rushden have the better goal difference; Yeovil have four to play. Neither have irresistible form. Both play tomorrow. This is the third year running the fixture list has thrown up a Conference summit in April and the first one Rushden have not lost. Cheltenham scored two in the last minute in 1999 to turn 0-1 into 2-1. Kidderminster beat them 2-0 last year. This time Rushden have emerged with their fate in their own hands. Their manager Brian Talbot said: \"There's still a lot to do and no one lays down for us.\" No one does as the feeling persists that the \u00a320m backing of Max Griggs, the man behind Dr Marten's, has tilted the playing field as Mohamed Al Fayed has at Fulham. Opponents try that bit harder. \"All I keep hearing is what a waste of money,\" said Talbot and the Yeovil fans had their chanting say after a rendering of Drink Up Thy Cider. But this season Rushden have spent nothing on transfers, reinforcing their ranks with \"frees\" and the youth system. They have a set-up fit for the League and, as Yeovil's Colin Addison said, \"they're three years down the road on us. If we don't do it now, it won't be failure.\" Yeovil, who also breed their own, got into the Conference only in 1998 and are still completing their ground after moving from the old Huish in 1990. They are not ones to talk of level playing fields. But the slope was well remembered in a minute's silence for Alec Stock, manager of the club's most romantic moments. They may be hard to match in the new trading estate. The mass of green and white, which helped lift the ground's crowd record to 8,868, willed a reprise of Celtic celebrations but it was not to be. On a cherry-blossom day there was little polish. The prize was greater than the poise. Anxiety ruled. The first half was played largely in the air. Much of the second took in the whole estate. Everyone buzzed with energy, few with purpose. Last week scientists revealed that bees can think. They might look into footballers next. But neither side needed to prove their credentials. Yeovil extended a history of Cup glories at Blackpool this year. At one time they were nine points clear of Rushden, who lost the next two games after Yeovil beat them in November but have since lost one in 19. Diamonds are forever coming. They should arrive on May 5. Each manager praised his own positive approach. Yeovil's Darren Way and Rushden's Andrew Burgess stood out in midfield. Tony Pennock tipped over Duane Darby's point-blank header and, in a final siege by Yeovil, with the centre- back Terry Skiverton thrown forward, Tom White saw his bullet blocked by Billy Turley. The old ground is a supermarket now - no doubt with all the grapefruits down in one corner. The climax would have been even better there - a breathless close at the Huish.",
