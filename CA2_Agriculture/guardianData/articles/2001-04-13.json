Here our narrator, Chick, is sandwiched between Michael Jackson's entourage and the penthouse in which his friend Ravelstein, the powerhouse liberal academic whose biography he has been asked to write, is staying.

Although she sets her village tale in the 1970s, she skilfully steers clear of the slavish name-checking of styles and spectacles that frequently renders period narrative unconvincing. And her main characters - a wayward, confused teenage girl and a wandering obsessive with serious mental problems - are made to run satisfyingly along parallel tracks that refuse to converge in cod-resolution. </p> <p>Greenlaw's primary creation is the myopic Mary George, who teeters, hedges and occasionally crashes around backwater Essex avoiding the attentions of her concerned but chaotic mother and pining after the father who left them. Temporary releases occur in the form of the soothing obscurities of the Velvet Underground, the occasional illicit spliff and her own peculiar stylishness. Swathed in second-hand clothes and smeared with make-up, she prompts bewilderment in the assorted gossips of Allnorthover and the admiration of an older, devoutly modish art student. But if Mary is typical in her mixture of hesitancy, shyness and covert rebellion, she is also marked out by her history. Throughout the novel runs the ominous tattoo of melodrama, as Mary's architect father, Matthew, is revealed to have been a prime mover in one of the community's tentative moves towards the modern world in the shape of a reservoir. Now the disturbed Tom Hepple - all autistic calculations and failed ECT treatments - comes to reclaim his family home, sunk Atlantis-style beneath the reservoir's shining surfaces. Unfortunately for Mary, Tom believes that only Matthew's daughter, glimpsed balancing blindly on a branch overhanging the reservoir, can guide him to the building that he must raise from the depths. </p> <p>Greenlaw is equally good at depicting the claustrophobic miseries of adolescence and the confining obsessions of madness, but she is also occasionally distracted from her primary talent - for quiet observational moments and strange off-key relationships - by the opposition of these two characters. Appearing to lack the confidence to go fully into either of their furiously hectic interior worlds, she ends up slightly short-changing both of them, just failing to animate their concerns and confusions. </p> <p>But if Mary and Tom fade somewhat in and out of view, Greenlaw certainly succeeds in her painstaking portrait of a small settlement, its past grounded and deepened with historical detail and its present-day life sketched with both force and subtlety. She has a highly poetic sensibility but, once again resisting temptation, she rarely overwrites. Instead, there are drab caravan dwellers with \"cramped, effortful gestures\" and greenish skin, \"as if they brought with them the light of their evenings squeezed close to their televisions\". They sit starkly against a vast landscape in which it is virtually impossible to find \"a place to get out from under the sky\"; heavy rain that leaves behind it \"a flooded corner glazed in white light\"; a long, hot summer that shrouds buildings in shabbiness and blanks everything out to \"flattened perspectives and dull surfaces\". </p> <p>For Mary, this enervating atmosphere is something she must escape, along with the identikit village halls, musty hairdressers and her mother's cramped, near-defunct Mini. At the end of the novel, Tom's lurid excesses may have granted her the opportunity to flee both past and location, although one could wonder whether this is a sledgehammer to crack a nut.

In addition to his novels and poetry he also wrote, almost 20 years ago, a superb book about the 1981 World Poker Series called The Biggest Game In Town . This is essentially a reprise of that book - in fact, it contains whole recycled chunks of it - demanding the question, why now? </p> <p>The answer lies in the packaging: here we have a coffee-table book with lavish prints and some singularly ill-judged \"modish\" typography. The fact is that poker has itself become modish - or at least that publishers think they can make money out of it - and this is an attempted cash-in on the new (if unconvincing) gambling zeitgeist. Loads of people have been roped into this, probably including me, but the worst ones are a new breed of nouveau poker players, often journalists on the fringes of the literary mafia, who actively flaunt their gambling selves and really seem to think of themselves as winners. </p> <p>I would not include Alvarez in this coterie. He is determinedly, if somewhat self-consciously, old-school. Yet personally I have never seen poker as proper gambling because a) there are real, surmountable odds that the right, sensible mind can oversee profitably; and b) it is not the robotic, evil house or bookie that you are fighting and attempting to fleece, but real humans you are attempting cunningly to outwit. </p> <p>A rather malicious activity, then, when compared to the doomed, deluded gambling aesthetic to which the rest of us succumb; in fact, rather like real life, or a job. I am not saying that proper gamblers bet only to lose - that is another self-conscious psychological tic that some people like to flaunt - but that there is a certain reckoning of likely defeat that goes along with the determination to enjoy the occasional big win when it comes: to splurge it all, to chuck it away joyously until it is gone, just for the . . . respite. </p> <p>But poker players don't seem to think like that. To me they have always seemed colder than other gamblers, and also to view their gambling, inappropriately, as an extension of their workaday worth rather than an inglorious escape from it. It's clear from Alvarez's introduction that he knows this: \"Poker isn't about gambling,\" he writes, but then, \"I've never much cared for gambling.\" Poker is about \"discipline and calculation\", whereas \"to bet on horses, the dogs . . . is at worst an addiction, at best a romantic weakness.

      "bodyText": "Poker Al Alvarez 125pp, Bloomsbury \u00a320 Buy it at a discount at BOL Al Alvarez is a thoroughly amiable, honourable and, unusually for these days, witty and well-mannered man. In addition to his novels and poetry he also wrote, almost 20 years ago, a superb book about the 1981 World Poker Series called The Biggest Game In Town . This is essentially a reprise of that book - in fact, it contains whole recycled chunks of it - demanding the question, why now? The answer lies in the packaging: here we have a coffee-table book with lavish prints and some singularly ill-judged \"modish\" typography. The fact is that poker has itself become modish - or at least that publishers think they can make money out of it - and this is an attempted cash-in on the new (if unconvincing) gambling zeitgeist. Loads of people have been roped into this, probably including me, but the worst ones are a new breed of nouveau poker players, often journalists on the fringes of the literary mafia, who actively flaunt their gambling selves and really seem to think of themselves as winners. I would not include Alvarez in this coterie. He is determinedly, if somewhat self-consciously, old-school. Yet personally I have never seen poker as proper gambling because a) there are real, surmountable odds that the right, sensible mind can oversee profitably; and b) it is not the robotic, evil house or bookie that you are fighting and attempting to fleece, but real humans you are attempting cunningly to outwit. A rather malicious activity, then, when compared to the doomed, deluded gambling aesthetic to which the rest of us succumb; in fact, rather like real life, or a job. I am not saying that proper gamblers bet only to lose - that is another self-conscious psychological tic that some people like to flaunt - but that there is a certain reckoning of likely defeat that goes along with the determination to enjoy the occasional big win when it comes: to splurge it all, to chuck it away joyously until it is gone, just for the . . . respite. But poker players don't seem to think like that. To me they have always seemed colder than other gamblers, and also to view their gambling, inappropriately, as an extension of their workaday worth rather than an inglorious escape from it. It's clear from Alvarez's introduction that he knows this: \"Poker isn't about gambling,\" he writes, but then, \"I've never much cared for gambling.\" Poker is about \"discipline and calculation\", whereas \"to bet on horses, the dogs . . . is at worst an addiction, at best a romantic weakness.

And my homework for this week? Marking the homework of the brightest middle-aged boy in the class, reviewing reviews I first came across in 1976. </p> <p>I was about to read English at Oxford, which actually meant reading \"criticism\". Amis's reviews didn't feel like lit-crit; they felt like Clive James's TV-crit - they felt like fun. Amis, as I began to recognise his signature style, wasn't a leather-patches-on-tweed-jacket critic; no, he seemed a leather-patches-on-leather-jacket critic. </p> <p>Perhaps this is why he has always invited competitive disparagement as the appropriate register of admiration. And yet, the moment you get the new Amis you drop everything else to read it. At expectant moments in books, he observes, \"the reader leans forward\". Amis gets you leaning forward so often you're practically in italics . In the case of The War Against Clich\u00e9 , you first lean forward on the first page of the foreword. Amis is recalling how, in editorial conferences at the TLS , his knee-length boots were well-concealed by the \"the twin tepees of my flared trousers\". Nice. Typically nice. So typical as to serve, metaphorically, as an extension of the copyright page: the right of the author has been - and will continue to be - energetically asserted. This may not be a novel, but it is going to be a book by Martin Amis. </p> <p>Some people actually prefer the journalism to the novels but, like the big novels, this big book of journalism seems a little too big. Amis appears to have repeated Updike's error in Picked-Up Pieces , namely that \"many of its pieces ought never to have been picked up\". Do we really need 800 words on The Guinness Book of Records from 1971? Or 750 on The Best of Forum (1973)? Actually, this turns out to be a \"reason not the need\" scenario. If you bypass certain pages of a novel (as the word-bloat of The Information obliged you to do) then they're gone for good: you're never going back. But skipping and skimming the present volume means there is always something to return to. You think you've wrung it dry - but tucked away there's a little piece on Brian Aldiss or J G Ballard that you missed (actually there are another three on Ballard). The Information was diminished by its bulk, but in this context our only concern is economic. Suppose the book had been 75p cheaper and 100 pages shorter. Aren't you happy to shell out the price of this paper for 100 pages of recycled Amis? </p> <p>You might think you've had enough Amis, but you soon want more. Whatever the book, there is no one whose review of it you'd rather read. If I were the literary editor of Boats and Boatmen I'd be trying to commission 2,000 words on Moby-Dick . Or seeing if he could review this book. A weary passage by D M Thomas makes Amis fear \"that the writer's face is about to flop on to the typewriter keys; the sentences conjure nothing but an exhausted imagination\". Amis, by contrast, is always buzzing. So much so that he doesn't just review books, he rewrites them. The dogs Andrew Harvey sees in India, in A Journey in Ladakh , are predictably \"mangy\" or \"flea-ridden\". But if he'd looked closer, Amis counsels, he'd have seen that these \"distinctive creatures . . . look like abruptly promoted rats, bemused by their sudden elevation, and pining for a quiet return to the rodent kingdom\". They look, in other words, like Amis dogs. </p> <p>Of course there are certain writers even he can't improve on. All he can do with Bellow (\"a miserable mediocrity\", according to Amis's other arch-love, Nabokov) is make like a museum guide and respectfully point out one master-para after another. To a certain extent, what he says of Updike -\"happier with the hack than with the genius\" - holds true of Amis too. Quite a bit of his tenure as chief reviewer for the Sunday Times was spent writing about junk. He was used to better effect in the mid-1980s by the Atlantic Monthly , which provided him with the opportunity to roam the canon. We're used to people like Kundera banging on about Don Quixote , but Amis brings the novel alive by conceding that much of it is dead wood: \"While clearly an impregnable masterpiece, Don Quixote suffers from one fairly serious flaw - that of outright unreadability.\" Amis's great virtue is his outright readability - but could that also contain a flaw? </p> <p>Style \"is not something grappled on to regular prose; it is intrinsic to perception\". Accordingly, part of the pleasure of reading Amis derives from the way that certain linguistic thought patterns are so readily identifiable. Over the years his thought has tended automatically to configure itself in accordance with linguistic formulations that are, through force of habit, both distinctive and predetermined. In the Rabbit books Updike conclusively demonstrates \"that the unexamined life is worth examining\". This, as Amis says elsewhere - and perhaps criticism commands no more appropriate endorsement - \"feels accurate\". (As you would expect, in the case of a novelist-critic it feels accurate about Keith Talent as well as Harry Angstrom.) The spectacular handbrake turns and top-spin returns of phrase elicit \"gasps of continually renewed surprise\". </p> <p>But do Amis's famous stylistic manoeuvres permit the full deployment of thought? Pondering DeLillo's query about what happens to all the \"unexpended faith\" when the Old God dies, Amis responds, \"It's not that people will start believing in anything: they will start believing in everything.\" That's quick and brilliant, but isn't the conclusion syntactically preprogrammed by that trademark auto-reverse? Because the argument derives its force from a stylistic effect that is immediate and local, an ostensibly far-reaching sentiment feels oddly site-specific. And this doubt gives rise to a more general one: can prose of such stylistic panache accommodate complexity and depth? Or does sustained analytical thought demand something akin to Raymond Williams's furrowed qualifications and hesitations? </p> <p>Clich\u00e9 and stock response are Amis's enemies, but over time, there can arise a highly individualised form of stock response. Julie Burchill's reaction to Experience in these pages would be a pathological example: extrapolating from the process - deplored by Amis in the foreword - whereby a reviewer reads a book and \"sees which way it rubs him up\", she came to the book pre-rubbed up the wrong way. Then she read it. </p> <p>This is particularly likely once your reading becomes confined to what Waterstone's terms \"core stock\". Amis has several times professed his adherence to the \"law\" whereby writers don't read younger writers. Well, that's as may be, but Philip Roth - despite ominous signs to the contrary - is not going to live for ever. Yes, it's still fun to read Amis lapping up Updike or mauling Mailer, but it would be more interesting to see him get to grips with Denis Johnson, say, or Thom Jones. They may not have raised the bar of American prose - art doesn't get better over time - but they've certainly made it wobble. Either you accept that or your leather jacket starts getting tweedy round the elbows - you start turning into your dad.</p>",

Pondering DeLillo's query about what happens to all the \"unexpended faith\" when the Old God dies, Amis responds, \"It's not that people will start believing in anything: they will start believing in everything.\" That's quick and brilliant, but isn't the conclusion syntactically preprogrammed by that trademark auto-reverse? Because the argument derives its force from a stylistic effect that is immediate and local, an ostensibly far-reaching sentiment feels oddly site-specific. And this doubt gives rise to a more general one: can prose of such stylistic panache accommodate complexity and depth? Or does sustained analytical thought demand something akin to Raymond Williams's furrowed qualifications and hesitations? Clich\u00e9 and stock response are Amis's enemies, but over time, there can arise a highly individualised form of stock response. Julie Burchill's reaction to Experience in these pages would be a pathological example: extrapolating from the process - deplored by Amis in the foreword - whereby a reviewer reads a book and \"sees which way it rubs him up\", she came to the book pre-rubbed up the wrong way. Then she read it. This is particularly likely once your reading becomes confined to what Waterstone's terms \"core stock\". Amis has several times professed his adherence to the \"law\" whereby writers don't read younger writers. Well, that's as may be, but Philip Roth - despite ominous signs to the contrary - is not going to live for ever. Yes, it's still fun to read Amis lapping up Updike or mauling Mailer, but it would be more interesting to see him get to grips with Denis Johnson, say, or Thom Jones. They may not have raised the bar of American prose - art doesn't get better over time - but they've certainly made it wobble. Either you accept that or your leather jacket starts getting tweedy round the elbows - you start turning into your dad.",

Written in 1962, the book's droll attack on a conformist, cookie- cutter America chimed with the views of a fledgling hippy movement, was converted into an epoch-catching movie, and positioned its twentysomething author on the cusp of a glittering career. Instead Webb faded back into obscurity - partly through circumstance (subsequent books were badly received), partly by design (the retreat from evil fame). The following three decades carried him through various menial jobs, and from a California trailer park to a French nudist colony. For the past two years he and his artist wife Fred have rented a small flat above a shopping precinct on the south coast of England. New Cardiff is his first novel in a quarter of a century. </p> <p>Not that Webb is the type to return with any grand fanfare. On the contrary, this tale of a Brit abroad in autumnal New England sometimes reads like a protracted apology for its own existence. Its plot is startlingly unfurnished; its style at once timorous and oddly stubborn in its refusal to indulge in writerly flourishes. </p> <p>The novel unfolds as a series of conversations. In the first, a traumatised English illustrator, Colin, washes up at an artist's shop in a small Vermont township, the New Cardiff of the title; in the second he explains his condition to the managers of the local motel (his longtime girlfriend has dumped him in mysterious circumstances). In the third he is comforted by Mandy, the jittery carer with whom he begins a redemptive affair. The dialogue runs on for pages at a time - an attritional exchange of questions, repetitions and confirmations that plays like Mamet without the muscle. </p> <p>At sporadic intervals the indents stop to make way for full-page illustrations, portraits of the townsfolk. These come courtesy of the author's wife in the guise of Colin, who is always on the scout for fresh subjects. \"He's an excellent artist,\" remarks one character to another. \"Yes.

      "bodyText": "New Cardiff Charles Webb 355pp, Little Brown \u00a316.99 Buy it at a discount at BOL A Salinger-style recluse, Charles Webb remains best known for his debut novel The Graduate . Written in 1962, the book's droll attack on a conformist, cookie- cutter America chimed with the views of a fledgling hippy movement, was converted into an epoch-catching movie, and positioned its twentysomething author on the cusp of a glittering career. Instead Webb faded back into obscurity - partly through circumstance (subsequent books were badly received), partly by design (the retreat from evil fame). The following three decades carried him through various menial jobs, and from a California trailer park to a French nudist colony. For the past two years he and his artist wife Fred have rented a small flat above a shopping precinct on the south coast of England. New Cardiff is his first novel in a quarter of a century. Not that Webb is the type to return with any grand fanfare. On the contrary, this tale of a Brit abroad in autumnal New England sometimes reads like a protracted apology for its own existence. Its plot is startlingly unfurnished; its style at once timorous and oddly stubborn in its refusal to indulge in writerly flourishes. The novel unfolds as a series of conversations. In the first, a traumatised English illustrator, Colin, washes up at an artist's shop in a small Vermont township, the New Cardiff of the title; in the second he explains his condition to the managers of the local motel (his longtime girlfriend has dumped him in mysterious circumstances). In the third he is comforted by Mandy, the jittery carer with whom he begins a redemptive affair. The dialogue runs on for pages at a time - an attritional exchange of questions, repetitions and confirmations that plays like Mamet without the muscle. At sporadic intervals the indents stop to make way for full-page illustrations, portraits of the townsfolk. These come courtesy of the author's wife in the guise of Colin, who is always on the scout for fresh subjects. \"He's an excellent artist,\" remarks one character to another. \"Yes. Excellent,\" the other responds. In fact, to this untrained eye, Fred/Colin's pictures look a bit of a mixed bag. The worst suggest the work of those caricature artists who prey on the tourists in Leicester Square (all Jimmy Hill jaws and Ken Dodd teeth). The best call to mind the clean integrity of Norman Rockwell. Webb's writing treads a similarly fine line. New Cardiff wavers constantly between warm, homely simplicity and trite sentimentality.

After a breathtaking tropical downpour one lunchtime in 1992, I walked across the Plaza Vieja from the cloistered comfort of the Convento de Santa Clara in old Havana with the conservation architect Victor Marin.

This is less surprising, because the former ice-cream boy and newspaper vendor (he started work when he was 11) turned poet, magazine journalist and now novelist is a native with a love of the place, from its seediest seams to its noblest monuments. However, in these breathlessly fast and often filthy stories he appears to revel unforgivingly in the city's nadir. His Havana is one of the sleaziest cities you are ever likely to explore, and there are moments when you feel like excusing yourself from Gutierrez's spermy prose and clambering into the bath for a good scrub down with a bottle of Domestos and a long brush.

Read on further, through the piles of human excrement stinking on the stairwells of perilous apartment blocks. Read on further still, through chiaroscuro scenes of petty crime, demeaning jobs, the other-dimensional world of tourists - few at the time - in search of the picturesque and the embers of the Revolution; through more booze, illicit lobster and instant sex - until, finally, you begin to understand that you're entering into Havana's equivalent of London's wartime spirit during the Blitz. Superficially, Gutierrez's book is a deeply cynical sequence of motor-drive snapshots of a city at its lower limits. And yet you can also read these scenes, distilled through the always slightly drunken eyes of the earthy Pedro Juan, as a tale of human ingenuity and hidden hopefulness overcom ing near-insuperable odds. </p> <p>So, just occasionally, Gutierrez slows the pace - a homage, neatly translated by Natasha Wimmer, to the rapid-fire, high-pitched, inventive nasal \"cockney\" of Havana - and offers glimpses of near-redemption. \"There was an electrical storm in the distance, over the sea. All that could be seen were the flashes of light. The downpour had turned into heavy drizzle, and the wind had died down. The rain was pattering on the tiles of my roof, an imperturbable music. It was as if my soul had fled my body years ago and was just now coming back. I could feel it filtering into all the tiny corners of my being.\" But even in this transcendental moment, Pedro Juan is troubled by a sudden erection and turns to Isabel, \"a good woman nearby waiting to be fucked\".

From 1950s trad-jazz gadabout to international pop guru, Napier-Bell has seen it all and remembered most of it: he has seen superstars when they were simpering wee lads, and shared blowjob secrets with the great gay-UK pop sodality (Larry Parnes, Lionel Bart, Tom Watkins). On the surface, he's pure surface; but anyone familiar with Napier-Bell's previous 1960s summa (\"You Don't Have to Say You Love Me\") won't be surprised to learn that Black Vinyl, White Powder isn't just a name-drop glide through limo-land. Napier-Bell can tell spontaneous pop gold from titanic fraud, and sets down his patented form of higher gossip with a (kind of) moral purpose. </p> <p>If you're itching for the drug revelations his latest title seems to promise, you may be disappointed: there is little here that a reasonably aware scumsurfer couldn't have gleaned over the last decade - a period when all the dirty secrets previously kept by attorneys or dealers became public domain via the tabloidisation of the music press, various tell-all autobiographies and the advent of list TV (\"The 20 Greatest ODs of All Time!\"). Napier-Bell's cockily Manichaean title is just good PR come-on: showbiz has always been a snow biz, just as it has always been shaped by the ambisexual nous of gay managers and shored up by a hinterland of shadowy accounts (the offshore kind). </p> <p>This isn't a drugs book. Napier-Bell is not always accurate and accepts too many of the narco-mythologies at face value; but he's also canny enough to realise that, finally, all this shock-horror drug stuff is essentially a blind - an Apocalypse Now whizz-bang behind which greater crimes are carved out. Pop's real scandals involve low-end financial and contractual practices, but such is their small-print nature that they tend to fall all too conveniently between the business pages and the tabloid splash, and are rarely aired. </p> <p>Thus, the real insider revelations here concern the business of business. Napier-Bell is good on the inelegantly Byzantine clauses of early-1960s pop and how the major labels have always used self-serving sharp practices (like chart-rigging) to \"police\" themselves. He's also good on how 1960s pop was shaped - both in the boardroom and the studio - by unsung gay pioneers: there are incisive portraits of Kit Lambert, Joe Meek, Brian Epstein. (It is also heartening that the few things that still get his old heart racing - Pulp, Massive Attack, Daniel Miller's Mute label - are far from the Brits-approved norm.) Even at his most scurrilous, Napier-Bell is never knowingly nasty; he doesn't moralise, and has a truly sane acceptance of drugs and sex and their place in a hedonistic world. </p> <p>Napier-Bell reserves his real bile for our current Popstars moment, seeing in it not just a failure of creative nerve, but a wider, more worrying trend: the total eradication of personality in the name of profit. He's no Theodor Adorno, nor meant to be, but even Napier-Bell - arch scam-artist, king of the hype frontier - thinks things have gone too far in an industry in which the virtues of long-game creativity have been binned in favour of quick-hit global niche marketing. </p> <p>The only MacGowan in Napier-Bell's index is Cathy; but Shane MacGowan - in his own devil's-tune, dishevelled way - is as much a part of postmodern pop as H from Steps. If the boyband universe represents the triumph of product over personality, then MacGowan represents a strange Adults Only version which is all personality and - polite cough - never mind the music; his floggable persona has become the product, replacing anything so quaint as an actual CD of new material. </p> <p>Even a generous reading of MacGowan's career can't sidestep the fact that his best work was a long, long time ago. His true role is to keep all us old rock bores diverted - \"Ooh, did you hear the latest about Shane!\" - while the real business of pop business goes on. Is Shane a rebel heart way \"outside the system\" or one of its worst manifestations? The last bard in town or a lyric souse increasingly nearer late Jeffrey Bernard than mid-period Gram Parsons? </p> <p>It is probably safe to say that if MacGowan - a self-described \"alcoholic junkie Republican\" - didn't exist, the music industry wouldn't go out of its way to invent him. But he has done pretty well off the back of his role as ravaged ghost at pop's sushi feast. A gift for a dirt-hungry media with urgent space to fill, Shane is good X-rated copy, a 21st-century blarney stone for whom the pub- bound Q&amp;A has become an easy supper song. (In his shaky confessional hands, sex and drugs and rock'n'roll has been reduced to drugs and drugs and more drugs.)

      "bodyText": "Black Vinyl, White Powder Simon Napier-Bell 390pp, Ebury Press \u00a316.99 Buy it at a discount at BOL A Drink With Shane MacGowan Victoria Mary Clarke and Shane MacGowan 360pp, Sidgwick &amp; Jackson \u00a315.99 Buy it at a discount at BOL Simon Napier-Bell can probably look forward to an obituary - man who took Wham! to China! - that marks the apotheosis of a life spent pulling: strings, strokes, the other one. From 1950s trad-jazz gadabout to international pop guru, Napier-Bell has seen it all and remembered most of it: he has seen superstars when they were simpering wee lads, and shared blowjob secrets with the great gay-UK pop sodality (Larry Parnes, Lionel Bart, Tom Watkins). On the surface, he's pure surface; but anyone familiar with Napier-Bell's previous 1960s summa (\"You Don't Have to Say You Love Me\") won't be surprised to learn that Black Vinyl, White Powder isn't just a name-drop glide through limo-land. Napier-Bell can tell spontaneous pop gold from titanic fraud, and sets down his patented form of higher gossip with a (kind of) moral purpose. If you're itching for the drug revelations his latest title seems to promise, you may be disappointed: there is little here that a reasonably aware scumsurfer couldn't have gleaned over the last decade - a period when all the dirty secrets previously kept by attorneys or dealers became public domain via the tabloidisation of the music press, various tell-all autobiographies and the advent of list TV (\"The 20 Greatest ODs of All Time!\"). Napier-Bell's cockily Manichaean title is just good PR come-on: showbiz has always been a snow biz, just as it has always been shaped by the ambisexual nous of gay managers and shored up by a hinterland of shadowy accounts (the offshore kind). This isn't a drugs book. Napier-Bell is not always accurate and accepts too many of the narco-mythologies at face value; but he's also canny enough to realise that, finally, all this shock-horror drug stuff is essentially a blind - an Apocalypse Now whizz-bang behind which greater crimes are carved out. Pop's real scandals involve low-end financial and contractual practices, but such is their small-print nature that they tend to fall all too conveniently between the business pages and the tabloid splash, and are rarely aired. Thus, the real insider revelations here concern the business of business. Napier-Bell is good on the inelegantly Byzantine clauses of early-1960s pop and how the major labels have always used self-serving sharp practices (like chart-rigging) to \"police\" themselves. He's also good on how 1960s pop was shaped - both in the boardroom and the studio - by unsung gay pioneers: there are incisive portraits of Kit Lambert, Joe Meek, Brian Epstein. (It is also heartening that the few things that still get his old heart racing - Pulp, Massive Attack, Daniel Miller's Mute label - are far from the Brits-approved norm.) Even at his most scurrilous, Napier-Bell is never knowingly nasty; he doesn't moralise, and has a truly sane acceptance of drugs and sex and their place in a hedonistic world. Napier-Bell reserves his real bile for our current Popstars moment, seeing in it not just a failure of creative nerve, but a wider, more worrying trend: the total eradication of personality in the name of profit. He's no Theodor Adorno, nor meant to be, but even Napier-Bell - arch scam-artist, king of the hype frontier - thinks things have gone too far in an industry in which the virtues of long-game creativity have been binned in favour of quick-hit global niche marketing. The only MacGowan in Napier-Bell's index is Cathy; but Shane MacGowan - in his own devil's-tune, dishevelled way - is as much a part of postmodern pop as H from Steps. If the boyband universe represents the triumph of product over personality, then MacGowan represents a strange Adults Only version which is all personality and - polite cough - never mind the music; his floggable persona has become the product, replacing anything so quaint as an actual CD of new material. Even a generous reading of MacGowan's career can't sidestep the fact that his best work was a long, long time ago. His true role is to keep all us old rock bores diverted - \"Ooh, did you hear the latest about Shane!\" - while the real business of pop business goes on. Is Shane a rebel heart way \"outside the system\" or one of its worst manifestations? The last bard in town or a lyric souse increasingly nearer late Jeffrey Bernard than mid-period Gram Parsons? It is probably safe to say that if MacGowan - a self-described \"alcoholic junkie Republican\" - didn't exist, the music industry wouldn't go out of its way to invent him. But he has done pretty well off the back of his role as ravaged ghost at pop's sushi feast. A gift for a dirt-hungry media with urgent space to fill, Shane is good X-rated copy, a 21st-century blarney stone for whom the pub- bound Q&amp;A has become an easy supper song. (In his shaky confessional hands, sex and drugs and rock'n'roll has been reduced to drugs and drugs and more drugs.) If you want to be bright-side pretentious, he's taken on a kind of shamanic/storyteller role; if you want to be cynical, he's just a proxy low-life Calvary for all the little middle-class hacks.

      "body": "<p>Football managers will tell you it is the most important 15 minutes of their jobs, the brief window they have to re-invigorate resolve, alter tactics or simply remind their main striker that the goal is the thing with the netting in it. The half-time team talk is credited by television commentators as the catalyst which has altered the course of many a game. \"Ho, ho, Trevor,\" Motty will often say. \"You have to wonder what the manager said at half-time to make his team play like this.\" </p> <p>In which case, what exactly did Tunoa Lui, the coach of American Samoa, find to say to his lads as they trooped into the dressing room after 45 minutes against Australia in their World Cup qualifier on Wednesday, halfway as they were towards record international defeat? </p> <p>\"No worries, fellas, we can easily pull back 16 goals in the second half\" would have sounded a little optimistic; \"any chance of keeping a closer eye on their centre- forward, he's already scored eight\" a little obvious; and shouting at the goalkeeper that \"a dustbin placed in the middle of the goal-line would have saved more than you\" a little harsh. </p> <p>Apparently the team were all Christian fundamentalists and had spent a good 30 minutes before the game praying for guidance and success. After a first half like that it was probably advisable not to bother upstairs again. Besides, the Samoans' experience with prayer will no doubt be taken as proof of the notion often bandied in the bars of Sydney, that God, at least in his sporting guise, is an Australian. </p> <p>Best, then, to have adopted the line used by Brian Clough - and now, we may speculate, put to good use by his disciple Martin O'Neill at Celtic. </p> <p>Once, after an uncharacteristically shabby performance, Nottingham Forest were trailing 2-0 at half-time. Fearing a volcanic Cloughie bollocking, the players sheepishly shuffled into the dressing room to find no sign of the great man. </p> <p>After five long, worrisome minutes he had still not put in an appearance. After 10, with the tea drunk and the Jaffa cakes polished off, Stuart Pearce and a couple of other senior players took charge and chivvied their team-mates as best they could. After 15 minutes, still with no sign of Cloughie, the Forest team could hear their opponents clacking down the corridor out on to the pitch and the referee stuck his head round the door to tell them it was time to return. </p> <p>Then, just as his players were about to depart for the fray, Clough finally appeared. \"Sorry lads, all my fault\" was all he said. \"I picked the wrong team.\" </p> <p>Except in Tunoa Lui's case, he should have said: \"Sorry lads, all my fault. Picked the wrong country.\" </p> <p><strong>And finally...</strong></p> <p>This is the last White's Week. It is customary for proper, grown-up columnists signing off for the last time to thank the many readers who have taken the trouble to write in. But frankly the news of imminent departure will come as a relief to the correspondent who wrote to suggest that, judging by the standard of my prose, long-term exposure to speculation, conjecture and wild generalisation had clearly rotted what little brain I started off with. Thanks for that, mum. I'm off to take up another role in the super soaraway Guardian sports section, whose expansion remains top secret. If you have been, thanks for reading. And if you haven't, you'll never know what you missed.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Football managers will tell you it is the most important 15 minutes of their jobs, the brief window they have to re-invigorate resolve, alter tactics or simply remind their main striker that the goal is the thing with the netting in it. The half-time team talk is credited by television commentators as the catalyst which has altered the course of many a game. \"Ho, ho, Trevor,\" Motty will often say. \"You have to wonder what the manager said at half-time to make his team play like this.\" In which case, what exactly did Tunoa Lui, the coach of American Samoa, find to say to his lads as they trooped into the dressing room after 45 minutes against Australia in their World Cup qualifier on Wednesday, halfway as they were towards record international defeat? \"No worries, fellas, we can easily pull back 16 goals in the second half\" would have sounded a little optimistic; \"any chance of keeping a closer eye on their centre- forward, he's already scored eight\" a little obvious; and shouting at the goalkeeper that \"a dustbin placed in the middle of the goal-line would have saved more than you\" a little harsh. Apparently the team were all Christian fundamentalists and had spent a good 30 minutes before the game praying for guidance and success. After a first half like that it was probably advisable not to bother upstairs again. Besides, the Samoans' experience with prayer will no doubt be taken as proof of the notion often bandied in the bars of Sydney, that God, at least in his sporting guise, is an Australian. Best, then, to have adopted the line used by Brian Clough - and now, we may speculate, put to good use by his disciple Martin O'Neill at Celtic. Once, after an uncharacteristically shabby performance, Nottingham Forest were trailing 2-0 at half-time. Fearing a volcanic Cloughie bollocking, the players sheepishly shuffled into the dressing room to find no sign of the great man. After five long, worrisome minutes he had still not put in an appearance. After 10, with the tea drunk and the Jaffa cakes polished off, Stuart Pearce and a couple of other senior players took charge and chivvied their team-mates as best they could. After 15 minutes, still with no sign of Cloughie, the Forest team could hear their opponents clacking down the corridor out on to the pitch and the referee stuck his head round the door to tell them it was time to return. Then, just as his players were about to depart for the fray, Clough finally appeared. \"Sorry lads, all my fault\" was all he said. \"I picked the wrong team.\" Except in Tunoa Lui's case, he should have said: \"Sorry lads, all my fault. Picked the wrong country.\" And finally... This is the last White's Week. It is customary for proper, grown-up columnists signing off for the last time to thank the many readers who have taken the trouble to write in. But frankly the news of imminent departure will come as a relief to the correspondent who wrote to suggest that, judging by the standard of my prose, long-term exposure to speculation, conjecture and wild generalisation had clearly rotted what little brain I started off with. Thanks for that, mum. I'm off to take up another role in the super soaraway Guardian sports section, whose expansion remains top secret. If you have been, thanks for reading. And if you haven't, you'll never know what you missed.",

Like Sunderland's Kevin Phillips last term, he intends to win the golden boot in his first top-flight season. </p> <p>\"My original goal was to be in the top five scorers in the Premiership,\" says Stewart, whose 18 goals put him one ahead of Chelsea's Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink. \"My goal now is to win the golden boot.\" </p> <p>Despite his gleaming convertible Mercedes, the personable Stewart does not come across as a superstar. Perhaps it is the west country accent or the fact that he is devouring sausages and potato rather than broccoli and grilled fish. Maybe it is the CV which shows Bristol Rovers and Huddersfield as his former clubs. </p> <p>Yet his form encapsulates what George Burley is achieving at Ipswich. Where others ignored Stewart because of a perceived lack of pace, Burley paid Huddersfield \u00a32.5m a little over a year ago and has been vindicated. John McGreal, Matt Holland and Jermaine Wright have taken similar, cheaper routes. </p> <p>\"We are proud of the way we improve players,\" says Burley, who has spent around \u00a38m since winning promotion last May. \"And that's not luck, it's a day-in, day-out situation. We like to work on areas of the game where we think we can improve them. People always questioned that lack of pace with Marcus but I think he's got quicker and sharper since he came to the club. </p> <p>\"He's always had a great football brain, but playing with good players, training the way we do and being in this environment has improved him. His all-round game has been exceptional. He's not just a goalscorer, he does a lot with his work-rate and hold-up play.\" </p> <p>The hat-trick Stewart scored at Southampton recently illustrated his striking instinct. He knows, though, that a tougher test lies ahead. \"I think it will be a lot more difficult next season,\" he says. \"People will know what we're like as a team and what I'm like as a player.\" </p> <p>Kevin Phillips has found life harder second time around, yet Stewart is hopeful of continuing in the vein which makes Burley suggest he \"has to be considered\" for England. A former schoolboy international and under-21 squad member, Stewart's self-confidence is plain. </p> <p>\"I always felt I could play at this level,\" he says. \"I just needed someone to have the belief in me like the manager now and the chairman. They have given me the chance to play and to settle a few scores. That's what I've done this season; I've shut a few people up. I'm not going to name names, but they know who they are.\" </p> <p>That hunger is common among the cast-offs and bargains Burley has mixed with local talent. It cannot have gone unnoticed at Middlesbrough that Alun Armstrong, sold to Ipswich for \u00a3500,000 in December, got the equaliser against Liverpool on Tuesday to take his Premiership tally to five. That would make him Boro's second top scorer. </p> <p>Burley's eye for a player is augmented by training which concentrates on technique, organisation and repetition that makes Ipswich's passing and team pattern instinctive. Throw in the flexibility to play 4-4-2 or 3-5-2 and to use the aerial threat of James Scowcroft when necessary, and their success looks more than a flash in the pan. </p> <p>\"I think George Burley's the best manager I've worked with,\" Stewart says. \"Every player goes out knowing their job and how to achieve a win, and as a man-manager he's fantastic. He treats people like adults and I respect him for that because I've come across one or two managers who think you're an eight-year-old and try to treat you like one.\" </p> <p>A unity and sense of purpose is fostered from the top, with the chairman David Sheepshanks holding a pre-season meeting with the players to explain plans and canvass opinion. With increased revenue looming from the stadium expansion, and probably Europe, the future looks bright. \"We wanted to get to this standard within five years,\" Stewart says. \"We've achieved it in six months.\" </p> <p>He expects signings in the summer and believes the club could cope with European competition. \"If we stay clear of injuries, yeah. We've managed that quite well this year - touch wood - and we've done okay.\" </p> <p>Okay? As understatement of the year, that takes some beating.</p>",

A former schoolboy international and under-21 squad member, Stewart's self-confidence is plain. \"I always felt I could play at this level,\" he says. \"I just needed someone to have the belief in me like the manager now and the chairman. They have given me the chance to play and to settle a few scores. That's what I've done this season; I've shut a few people up. I'm not going to name names, but they know who they are.\" That hunger is common among the cast-offs and bargains Burley has mixed with local talent. It cannot have gone unnoticed at Middlesbrough that Alun Armstrong, sold to Ipswich for \u00a3500,000 in December, got the equaliser against Liverpool on Tuesday to take his Premiership tally to five. That would make him Boro's second top scorer. Burley's eye for a player is augmented by training which concentrates on technique, organisation and repetition that makes Ipswich's passing and team pattern instinctive. Throw in the flexibility to play 4-4-2 or 3-5-2 and to use the aerial threat of James Scowcroft when necessary, and their success looks more than a flash in the pan. \"I think George Burley's the best manager I've worked with,\" Stewart says. \"Every player goes out knowing their job and how to achieve a win, and as a man-manager he's fantastic. He treats people like adults and I respect him for that because I've come across one or two managers who think you're an eight-year-old and try to treat you like one.\" A unity and sense of purpose is fostered from the top, with the chairman David Sheepshanks holding a pre-season meeting with the players to explain plans and canvass opinion. With increased revenue looming from the stadium expansion, and probably Europe, the future looks bright. \"We wanted to get to this standard within five years,\" Stewart says. \"We've achieved it in six months.\" He expects signings in the summer and believes the club could cope with European competition. \"If we stay clear of injuries, yeah. We've managed that quite well this year - touch wood - and we've done okay.\" Okay? As understatement of the year, that takes some beating.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>There will be supporters of the non-league club Edinburgh City who will wish ill upon Livingston when they line up against Hibernian in today's Tennent's Scottish Cup semi- final. But they will be about the only \"neutrals\" to do so. </p> <p>Though Livingston were founded in 1995, they owe their place in the Scottish Football League to a controversial relocation. Meadowbank Thistle's owner Bill Hunter moved the club west and changed their name as their fans decamped en masse to Edinburgh City vowing never to give Hunter's brave, new creation - Livingston - a second glance. </p> <p>Fast forward six years. Hunter has long gone, forced to sell to the club for a single pound. And, to all but a few, Livingston now evoke widespread affection. </p> <p>Were Celtic to defeat Dundee United in tomorrow's other semi-final and Livingston to pull off a shock today, the First Division club would find themselves in next season's Uefa Cup. The main aim, however, is to be in the Scottish Premier League next season. Despite a rough patch a month ago and Ayr United's relentless pursuit, Livingston sit on top of the First Division, their new stadium fit and poised to welcome Premier League opposition. </p> <p>Their manager Jim Leishman is a larger-than-life character. He has long been known as a scribbler of McGonagall-esque verse. He has had some downs as well as ups since he took Dunfermline into the Premier Division in 1987 and repeated the feat two years later after a season back in the First, and is an ideal front man for the club. Good with the media, charming to visitors, the \"bard\" of Scottish football is an embracer of people. </p> <p>Behind the scenes, meanwhile, the club is being moulded into something of a football experiment.

      "bodyText": "There will be supporters of the non-league club Edinburgh City who will wish ill upon Livingston when they line up against Hibernian in today's Tennent's Scottish Cup semi- final. But they will be about the only \"neutrals\" to do so. Though Livingston were founded in 1995, they owe their place in the Scottish Football League to a controversial relocation. Meadowbank Thistle's owner Bill Hunter moved the club west and changed their name as their fans decamped en masse to Edinburgh City vowing never to give Hunter's brave, new creation - Livingston - a second glance. Fast forward six years. Hunter has long gone, forced to sell to the club for a single pound. And, to all but a few, Livingston now evoke widespread affection. Were Celtic to defeat Dundee United in tomorrow's other semi-final and Livingston to pull off a shock today, the First Division club would find themselves in next season's Uefa Cup. The main aim, however, is to be in the Scottish Premier League next season. Despite a rough patch a month ago and Ayr United's relentless pursuit, Livingston sit on top of the First Division, their new stadium fit and poised to welcome Premier League opposition. Their manager Jim Leishman is a larger-than-life character. He has long been known as a scribbler of McGonagall-esque verse. He has had some downs as well as ups since he took Dunfermline into the Premier Division in 1987 and repeated the feat two years later after a season back in the First, and is an ideal front man for the club. Good with the media, charming to visitors, the \"bard\" of Scottish football is an embracer of people. Behind the scenes, meanwhile, the club is being moulded into something of a football experiment. The chairman Dominic Keane used to be a director of Celtic. Now playing with his own chemistry set, he is putting long-held beliefs about the game into action. His desire to effect change has him leading a group of First Division clubs hoping to forge closer links with the SPL, viewed as a more dynamic and astute organisation than the Scottish Football League.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The government's failure to amend the antiquated British secrecy laws came under fire at the RSA fringe debate 'Secret Society', held in association with The Observer and Prospect magazine.</p> <p>The panel argued that the lack of a public interest defence for whistleblowers - which had been Labour's grounds for opposing the official secrecy legislation while in opposition - had a corrosive effect on good governance, democracy and public trust.</p> <p>With David Shayler's trial, due to begin on April 24th, John Wadham, the Director of the Liberty pressure group and Shayler's lawyer, said that the trial would be a defining moment for those who believed that the Official Secrets Act was incompatible with the Human Rights Act.</p> <p>Wadham argued that the issue of freedom of information was vital to demonstrating whether voting for a political party made any difference. While political parties in opposition promoted reform, every government had been wedded to maintaining as much secrecy as possible - as with Labour doing nothing to change the official secrets act. While the data protection act had changed the relationship between individuals and those who held files on them, it included double and triple layers of exemptions on national security grounds.</p> <p>Over two million security service files had been exempted, not because the content of the files could be shown to be damaging, but because the government continued to inhabit an 'Alice in Wonderland' world where it was considered damaging to disclose whether or not the files existed at all.</p> <p>Historian David Vincent of Keele University argued that the Labour government had been 'wrestling with its own best self\" on the secrecy issue. The government's own 1997 White Paper had marked a genuinely historic attempt to come to terms with the history of official secrecy, and had marked a major breakthrough in three central areas:</p> <p>Whereas Britain had traditionally measured its freedom against the tyranny of its neighbours, the white paper accepted that Britain had ceased to be the teacher and had become the pupil, needing to follow rather than to lead other democracies. The white paper had also signalled that the era of unwritten control had to come to an end - a significant shift for a polity which had pioneered 'double secrecy', being secretive about the existence of secrecy itself.</p> <p>The white paper accepted the need to talk about secrecy and to make distinctions based on a test of harm. And it recognised the erosion of the 'honourable secrecy' tradition - where those in power operated with restraint and a growing electorate accepted the right of office holders to make decisions. The post-Suez decline in faith in the integrity and competence of government had accelerated and made this untenable - only a refusal to trust could enable a culture of trust to be re-established.</p> <p>But Vincent argued that the government had missed its opportunity to deliver the reform which the white paper promised. A belief that the electorate did not care, the stubborn power of tradition and the tendency to keep rules as general as possible to provide catch-all had diluted reform heavily.</p> <p>Robert McCrum, Literary Editor of The Observer, joined criticism of a 'parody of a freedom of information act'. He had written a novel in the early nineteen-eighties, based on the ABC trial, seeking to capture the paranoid climate of those times. But what was striking was how little had changed in this debate: why did democracy require so much secrecy and that the governed be subordinate to the governed?

      "bodyText": "The government's failure to amend the antiquated British secrecy laws came under fire at the RSA fringe debate 'Secret Society', held in association with The Observer and Prospect magazine. The panel argued that the lack of a public interest defence for whistleblowers - which had been Labour's grounds for opposing the official secrecy legislation while in opposition - had a corrosive effect on good governance, democracy and public trust. With David Shayler's trial, due to begin on April 24th, John Wadham, the Director of the Liberty pressure group and Shayler's lawyer, said that the trial would be a defining moment for those who believed that the Official Secrets Act was incompatible with the Human Rights Act. Wadham argued that the issue of freedom of information was vital to demonstrating whether voting for a political party made any difference. While political parties in opposition promoted reform, every government had been wedded to maintaining as much secrecy as possible - as with Labour doing nothing to change the official secrets act. While the data protection act had changed the relationship between individuals and those who held files on them, it included double and triple layers of exemptions on national security grounds. Over two million security service files had been exempted, not because the content of the files could be shown to be damaging, but because the government continued to inhabit an 'Alice in Wonderland' world where it was considered damaging to disclose whether or not the files existed at all. Historian David Vincent of Keele University argued that the Labour government had been 'wrestling with its own best self\" on the secrecy issue. The government's own 1997 White Paper had marked a genuinely historic attempt to come to terms with the history of official secrecy, and had marked a major breakthrough in three central areas: Whereas Britain had traditionally measured its freedom against the tyranny of its neighbours, the white paper accepted that Britain had ceased to be the teacher and had become the pupil, needing to follow rather than to lead other democracies. The white paper had also signalled that the era of unwritten control had to come to an end - a significant shift for a polity which had pioneered 'double secrecy', being secretive about the existence of secrecy itself. The white paper accepted the need to talk about secrecy and to make distinctions based on a test of harm. And it recognised the erosion of the 'honourable secrecy' tradition - where those in power operated with restraint and a growing electorate accepted the right of office holders to make decisions. The post-Suez decline in faith in the integrity and competence of government had accelerated and made this untenable - only a refusal to trust could enable a culture of trust to be re-established. But Vincent argued that the government had missed its opportunity to deliver the reform which the white paper promised. A belief that the electorate did not care, the stubborn power of tradition and the tendency to keep rules as general as possible to provide catch-all had diluted reform heavily. Robert McCrum, Literary Editor of The Observer, joined criticism of a 'parody of a freedom of information act'. He had written a novel in the early nineteen-eighties, based on the ABC trial, seeking to capture the paranoid climate of those times. But what was striking was how little had changed in this debate: why did democracy require so much secrecy and that the governed be subordinate to the governed? McCrum argued that the issue was of profound importance to democratic politics, because 'secrecy is a virus which corrupts the body politic'. Nigel West, the writer and former Conservative MP, argued that the government's refusal to participate in the debate demonstrated that they were frightened of the truth. The deep-rooted culture of British secrecy failed to protect vital secrecy adequately - for example, in cases of informants in terrorism cases - because it did so much to protect political embarassment and incompetenct administration. West regarded the Labour government's record as hypocritical, especially in the continued use of Public Interest Immunity Certificates, which went to the heart of justice and of an individuals right to defend themselves. West argued that it was difficult to recognise the Robin Cook who had performed so impressively in criticising the government over the Scott Report and the Matrix-Churchill case, or to reconcile Jack Straw's positions in opposition with his actions in power. The debate, chaired by broadcaster Sheena MacDonald, included floor contributions from participants in many recent cases - including David Shayler, Nigel Wylde (who had been involved in the Tony Geraghty case), and Martin Bright of The Observer, who criticised the government's failure to send any representative to defend their actions. While the government was heavily criticised, the fundamental importance of the Human Rights Act as being a catalyst for reform was recognised while the instability of the current system meant that further reform would prove inevitable. David Vincent argued that backing away from reform could prove highly damaging to a second Labour term - a failure to rebuild a relationship of trust with citizens would scupper effective progressive governance. Yet the blueprint for effective reform had been set out by the government itself before losing their nerve on this issue. A central issue to judging the effectiveness of reform was whether it shifted the burden of proof - so that the onus was on government to show why it would be necessary to withhold specific pieces of information, rather than requiring those seeking information to make a case for obtaining it. Central areas of discussion included the dangers of the security services expanding their remit into the criminal justice system without clear rules and of the nature of oversight. John Wadham argued that Tom King, having been defence secretary and Northern Ireland secretary, had been the wrong choice to head the oversight committee and that his successor should not be somebody so closely associated with the system. Nigel West argued that resources for oversight were deeply inadequate. Reform would also depend on shifting the issue of freedom of information from the political margins to the mainstream.

      "body": "<p>After enduring a rollercoaster couple of years, many of the 700,000 investors holding shares in Powergen will probably welcome this week's \u00a37.65 a share offer for the company as a pretty fair deal. </p> <p>German utility giant e.on has unveiled an agreed bid for Powergen, the electricity generator and supplier privatised by the government in 1991. It would see the typical small investor receive a cheque for around \u00a31,032 in return for their average holding of 135 shares. </p> <p>That's pretty good going when you consider 135 Powergen shares were worth only \u00a3820 in mid-January, and just \u00a3443 at one point in March last year. Someone who invested back in 1991 would have paid \u00a3236 for 135 shares. </p> <p>But while most commentators were agreed that \u00a37.65, paid in cash, is a fair price, the downside is that you will have to wait a whole year to get your money, and approval for the deal is by no means a certainty. </p> <p>Jobs &amp; Money canvassed the views of two experts. One said Powergen shareholders were getting a very good deal but, faced with waiting until next spring for what was only a likely rather than a definite payout, some may want to consider selling if the share price nudges up very close to the offer price. </p> <p>Our other expert said that, while more cautious investors will probably do best to stick with the stock, for more active investors there is definitely an argument for selling and taking the profits following its strong run over the past year. </p> <p>It was almost exactly 10 years ago that 60% of Powergen (created from the privatisation of the Central Electricity Generating Board) was sold to the public. Under the share offer the minimum investment was \u00a3200 which equated to 114 shares. Around 1.5m people took the plunge and signed up. In February 1995 the government sold its remaining 40% stake in Powergen. The offer price then was \u00a35.12, payable in three instalments. </p> <p>The company now has 552,000 shareholders who own between one and 250 shares, while another 145,000 individuals hold more than this number. </p> <p>On Monday, after almost three months of talks, e.on unveiled its \u00a39.6bn agreed bid for the company. The offer represents an 8.4% premium to Powergen's closing price of \u00a37.06 on Friday April 6, and a 25.8% premium over January 16, the last trading day before the two companies confirmed they were in talks, when it closed at \u00a36.08. </p> <p>The deal will require the consent of regulators in both the UK and America, and provided they give the go-ahead it is expected to be completed in the spring of next year. Once approval is given e.on will launch its formal offer for Powergen, and at that point shareholders will have the choice of accepting or rejecting the share offer. If the vast majority (probably 95%-plus) of people accept, e.on will be entitled to compulsorily purchase the shares of the small minority who say no. </p> <p>The UK group's board are urging shareholders to back the bid, saying it is \"a good deal\" for them, employees and customers. </p> <p>Powergen says those investors worried about the capital gains tax (CGT) implications will be able to receive their payment in the form of loan notes - a sort of IOU that allows you to take your cash at a later stage. Loan notes are often used where people are worried that a payment or windfall will exceed the annual CGT allowance (currently \u00a37,500). </p> <p>Powergen's share price has gyrated wildly over the past two years or so. At the start of 1999 it topped \u00a39 but within months it ended up one of the Footsie's biggest fallers, plunging 44% that year. It tumbled to a low of \u00a33.28 last March but over the past 12 months has staged a remarkable comeback, outperforming the FTSE All-Share index by a staggering 98.7%. </p> <p>So what do the experts say? Simon Cawdery at Barclays Stockbrokers reckons Powergen investors are \"getting a damn good deal\". However, he adds that the takeover is not done and dusted by any means. He points out that Powergen will pay a dividend of about 5% to its shareholders in the interim, which he says will compensate them for having to wait a year to get their money. </p> <p> However, he reckons that if the shares get very close to the offer price over the next couple of months and hit around \u00a37.30, \"you are probably better-off selling those shares in the market\". But he adds that for stock market novices who bought the shares at privatisation, holding them until the deal is approved means you don't have to pay any sharedealing fees, which you would of course have to fork out if you sell now. </p> <p>At NatWest Stockbrokers, Jeremy Batstone says small investors holding Powergen will be \"pretty chuffed\" about its performance over the past 12 months, during which it has been seen as a relatively safe haven in a storm. He also points out that there are regulatory hurdles to overcome, and says the \u00a37.65 a share offer was slightly below its original expectations of around \u00a38.20 a share. </p> <p>While NatWest Stockbrokers' official house view of the share is that they are a \"hold,\" Mr Batstone says he would not have a problem with people selling now and banking their profits. It all comes down to your attitude to risk, he adds. If you're relatively risk-averse there is definitely an argument for sitting on the stock and awaiting developments. If you're a more active investor it is very tempting to take the money now. </p> <p> <strong> Plus point: e.on chairman Ulrich Hartmann's bid could mean windfalls - but not yet</strong></p>",

      "body": "<p>One of the country's largest community based credit unions faces closure or takeover after a financial crisis that has prevented savers from withdrawing their cash for eight months. </p> <p>The Camberwell Credit Union in south London, which has more than 2,500 members, was effectively frozen last August following an investigation that discovered mismanagement and a lack of controls to protect its assets. </p> <p>Efforts to revive the business, which offers savings and loans to low income groups, have so far failed to satisfy the regulator, the Financial Services Authority. </p> <p>But if plans for a takeover by a neighbouring credit union, which failed at the first try in December, or a full recovery of outstanding loans are not achieved, savers face the prospect of losing up to 15% of their capital. </p> <p>The problems are a blow to the government, which wants credit unions to be a central plank of its plans to protect low income groups from loan sharks and finance companies that offer crippling interest rates. Chancellor Gordon Brown believes credit unions could do more than offer savings and loans and are well placed to promote a range of banking services to local community groups in hard pressed areas of the country. </p> <p>The FSA is consulting with credit unions, banks and other interested parties about regulations due to take effect next year that will strengthen regulations and offer credit union members greater protection. </p> <p>At the moment credit unions can count on 300,000 members and \u00a3180m of assets. They are run largely by volunteers and rely on the active involvement of members to maintain probity. </p> <p>They must purchase insurance to protect members from fraud and embezzlement. However, shortfalls arising from mismanagement or incompetence are not covered. </p> <p>The new regulations will protect credit union members for the first time. They will get the first \u00a32,000 of their money back in full and 90% of the next \u00a331,000, bettering the current arrangement for bank customers, who can recover 90% of the first \u00a318,000. FSA chairman Howard Davies said last December: \"We aim to develop a practical and proportionate regulatory system for credit unions which should meet the needs of the credit union movement and its members. </p> <p>\"We are confident these proposals will improve consumer confidence in the financial soundness of credit unions, and that this will help to provide the positive environment credit unions need in order to grow and to pursue their social objectives.\" </p> <p>The rules are likely to come too late for the Camberwell members when they come into force in summer 2002. </p> <p>Peter Bussey, a director of the Camberwell credit union, said it was in a position to repay savers 63% of their cash at the moment and expected to recover 85%-90% when all loans had been recalled. </p> <p>A credit union running normally would expect to have 70% of its assets out on loan and only 30% in the bank. Despite already exceeding these levels, negotiations designed to reopen the business, between the union and the FSA have stalled.</p>",

      "bodyText": "One of the country's largest community based credit unions faces closure or takeover after a financial crisis that has prevented savers from withdrawing their cash for eight months. The Camberwell Credit Union in south London, which has more than 2,500 members, was effectively frozen last August following an investigation that discovered mismanagement and a lack of controls to protect its assets. Efforts to revive the business, which offers savings and loans to low income groups, have so far failed to satisfy the regulator, the Financial Services Authority. But if plans for a takeover by a neighbouring credit union, which failed at the first try in December, or a full recovery of outstanding loans are not achieved, savers face the prospect of losing up to 15% of their capital. The problems are a blow to the government, which wants credit unions to be a central plank of its plans to protect low income groups from loan sharks and finance companies that offer crippling interest rates. Chancellor Gordon Brown believes credit unions could do more than offer savings and loans and are well placed to promote a range of banking services to local community groups in hard pressed areas of the country. The FSA is consulting with credit unions, banks and other interested parties about regulations due to take effect next year that will strengthen regulations and offer credit union members greater protection. At the moment credit unions can count on 300,000 members and \u00a3180m of assets. They are run largely by volunteers and rely on the active involvement of members to maintain probity. They must purchase insurance to protect members from fraud and embezzlement. However, shortfalls arising from mismanagement or incompetence are not covered. The new regulations will protect credit union members for the first time. They will get the first \u00a32,000 of their money back in full and 90% of the next \u00a331,000, bettering the current arrangement for bank customers, who can recover 90% of the first \u00a318,000. FSA chairman Howard Davies said last December: \"We aim to develop a practical and proportionate regulatory system for credit unions which should meet the needs of the credit union movement and its members. \"We are confident these proposals will improve consumer confidence in the financial soundness of credit unions, and that this will help to provide the positive environment credit unions need in order to grow and to pursue their social objectives.\" The rules are likely to come too late for the Camberwell members when they come into force in summer 2002. Peter Bussey, a director of the Camberwell credit union, said it was in a position to repay savers 63% of their cash at the moment and expected to recover 85%-90% when all loans had been recalled. A credit union running normally would expect to have 70% of its assets out on loan and only 30% in the bank. Despite already exceeding these levels, negotiations designed to reopen the business, between the union and the FSA have stalled.",

      "body": "<p> If Everlast and Eminem ever come to blows - which they nearly did last autumn when Eminem recorded a song attacking the former House of Pain frontman as a \"punk pussy bitch\" - the smart money says Everlast would wipe the floor with his rival. Em may own a chainsaw, but Ev is a weightier proposition in the ways that count. </p> <p>Despite a near-fatal heart attack three years ago, aged only 28, the former Eric Schrody has engineered a career manoeuvre that has vaulted him from rap has-been to acclaimed wild-hearted blues belter. So much for the idea that rappers sing like elks. Everlast steers his songs' minor-key melancholy with the gravelly beauty of Tom Waits. Coming from someone whose only hit with House of Pain, Jump Around, owed its hookline to the Osmonds' Crazy Horses, this is impressive. </p> <p>Inevitably, Jump Around made an appearance in this set, and its homeboy euphoria induced mass wobbling in the stuffed Astoria. One supplicant even waved a pair of crutches over his head. But its good-time foolishness was an anomaly in an evening devoted to Everlast's two solo albums, the 3m-selling Whitey Ford Sings the Blues and last year's Eat at Whitey's. Even as Jump Around trumpeted to a halt, Everlast was climbing behind an acoustic guitar for the painfully lovely torch song Black Coffee. Definitely not the All Saints number, it commanded rapt attention as the band quieted to a whisper, and Ev sighed, \"She's like a junkie, just like a junkie,\" echoed by guest diva Carleen Anderson. </p> <p>Whoever \"she\" was, she disturbed Everlast as much as the \"they\" who crop up in the country-blues melodrama Black Jesus (\"They call me white devil, black Jesus\"), which he sang as if half-consumed by fire and brimstone. These paled, though, beside the shock of Painkiller, which employed disjointed hip-hop to record his feelings at waking up after his heart attack. \"Can't believe it, I'm in a wheelchair,\" he rapped, terse and unforgiving. </p> <p>Although nothing like House of Pain's raucous escapism, Everlast's new incarnation is striking a chord. His promotion from the tiny cellar he played last time he was in London to the larger Astoria testifies to his public's willingness to embrace him, angst and all.</p>",

      "bodyText": "If Everlast and Eminem ever come to blows - which they nearly did last autumn when Eminem recorded a song attacking the former House of Pain frontman as a \"punk pussy bitch\" - the smart money says Everlast would wipe the floor with his rival. Em may own a chainsaw, but Ev is a weightier proposition in the ways that count. Despite a near-fatal heart attack three years ago, aged only 28, the former Eric Schrody has engineered a career manoeuvre that has vaulted him from rap has-been to acclaimed wild-hearted blues belter. So much for the idea that rappers sing like elks. Everlast steers his songs' minor-key melancholy with the gravelly beauty of Tom Waits. Coming from someone whose only hit with House of Pain, Jump Around, owed its hookline to the Osmonds' Crazy Horses, this is impressive. Inevitably, Jump Around made an appearance in this set, and its homeboy euphoria induced mass wobbling in the stuffed Astoria. One supplicant even waved a pair of crutches over his head. But its good-time foolishness was an anomaly in an evening devoted to Everlast's two solo albums, the 3m-selling Whitey Ford Sings the Blues and last year's Eat at Whitey's. Even as Jump Around trumpeted to a halt, Everlast was climbing behind an acoustic guitar for the painfully lovely torch song Black Coffee. Definitely not the All Saints number, it commanded rapt attention as the band quieted to a whisper, and Ev sighed, \"She's like a junkie, just like a junkie,\" echoed by guest diva Carleen Anderson. Whoever \"she\" was, she disturbed Everlast as much as the \"they\" who crop up in the country-blues melodrama Black Jesus (\"They call me white devil, black Jesus\"), which he sang as if half-consumed by fire and brimstone. These paled, though, beside the shock of Painkiller, which employed disjointed hip-hop to record his feelings at waking up after his heart attack. \"Can't believe it, I'm in a wheelchair,\" he rapped, terse and unforgiving. Although nothing like House of Pain's raucous escapism, Everlast's new incarnation is striking a chord. His promotion from the tiny cellar he played last time he was in London to the larger Astoria testifies to his public's willingness to embrace him, angst and all.",

It offers a way for families to help reduce their children's mortgage bills or cut years off the loan, by offsetting their savings against their youngster's borrowings. </p> <p>How it works is that the son or daughter takes out an open plan offset mortgage with the Woolwich, where the rate they pay is set at 0.75% above the Bank of England base rate for life (currently 6.25%). This deal allows people to offset savings against debts, and you can borrow up to 95% of the value of your home. </p> <p>Then the parent opens a Woolwich open plan account for savers, which they can link to the mortgage. The value of the money in this account is then offset against the mortgage, saving interest on the home loan. </p> <p>However, the parent's (or grandparent's) money is kept completely separate and they control the account, enabling them to add or withdraw money at any time. They simply make a phone call to link their account. </p> <p>The mortgage holder saves money by only paying interest on the difference between the amount borrowed and the amount in the linked savings account. For example, someone with a \u00a370,000 mortgage whose parents or grandparents offset \u00a310,000 of savings will only pay mortgage interest on \u00a360,000 all the time that the savings are in the account, which would save the borrower \u00a352 a month. </p> <p>Existing offset mortgage customers can also benefit from this new option. And offset together isn't restricted to family members. \"Anyone can offset funds against someone's offset mortgage, for example siblings or partners,\" says a spokeswoman. </p> <p>\"Also, the offsetting doesn't have to be a long-term arrangement - it can be changed at any time. Parents in receipt of a windfall or pay bonus could offset it against the mortgage until they have decided what to do with it,\" she adds. </p> <p>It means parents can help ease the financial strain that many young people go through when setting up their first home without actually having to give their money to them. </p> <p>Many parents already give children a helping hand with their mortgage. A survey has shown that 27% of first-time buyers were given their deposit by a family member. </p> <p>Also this week, Legal &amp; General launched the \"in-tuition mortgage\", a flexible package designed to enable parents to plan for a range of costs associated with schooling such as nursery fees, private education and university costs. It also enables parents with children already at fee-paying schools to release funds to pay the ongoing fees. </p> <p>The deal is based around L&amp;G's flexible reserve mortgage and allows people to borrow up to an agreed limit over and above the amount needed for the mortgage on their home. It also allows parents to make overpayments and then draw down on the reserve they've built up to pay for educational costs when they arise. </p> <p>There are two varieties of the loan, one with a variable rate of 6.35% and the other with a rate of 6.45%, though in both cases there is a 0.5% discount for the first two years. These rates apply from May 1. \"Mortgages are not just about buying a home these days. You can use it to manage your lifestyle,\" says a L&amp;G spokesman. </p> <p> Meanwhile the new Charcol deal is the result of a link with Newcastle building society and is capped at 5.99% for three years - that means you will not pay more than this until July 1 2004. </p> <p>The loan is pegged to the bank base rate, and what's different about this deal is that you will get double any base rate cut - so if the base rate falls by 0.5%, the mortgage rate is cut by 1%. The downside is that if interest rates then rise, payments will also rise by double the increase. But with the 5.99% cap in place, you can be secure in the knowledge that you won't pay any more than this. </p> <p>At the end of the three-year period the rate reverts to Newcastle's standard mortgage rate, but there are only early redemption penalties within the three years so you can walk away at that point. You need to be able to pay a deposit of at least 10%, and there is a \u00a3350 arrangement fee and a \u00a349 booking fee. </p> <p>In other mortgage news, Britannia building society is cutting its standard mortgage rate for new and existing borrowers , which will fall from 7.39% to 7.14% from May 1 following the recent base rate cut. </p> <p>But from July 1, loyal borrowers who have had their current mortgage for 10 years or more will pay a standard variable rate of 6.59%, with borrowers for more than five years paying 6.79%. The standard rate for borrowers who have been with the society less than five years will fall to 6.99%.</p>",

      "byline": "Michael Billington",

      "body": "<p>The timing is perfect. Forty years after the first manned orbit of the earth Robert Lepage brings us a one-man show about space exploration. But, being a Lepage show, it is as much about inner as outer space. Part of its magic lies in its combination of emotional fervour and technical wizardry. </p> <p>In a sense two stories are being told. On a public level Lepage recalls the competitive Soviet-American moon-race, which he sees largely as an exercise in national vanity. In the private sphere, Lepage tells of two warring Quebec brothers brought together by their mother's death. One is a shy philosopher struggling with a thesis on the influence of space exploration on popular culture; the other is a gay, extrovert TV weatherman who takes a pragmatic view of the galaxy's mysteries. And, just as the 1975 joint Apollo-Soyuz mission brought together the rival nations, so the fractious brothers are finally reconciled. </p> <p>I sometimes feel with Lepage that his theatrical legerdemain outstrips his ideas. But here style and content work in perfect harmony as he explores the notion that individuals and nations can offer mirror images of each other. The show's key metaphor is of reflecting surfaces and it reaches an astonishing climax in a scene where Lepage simulates an astronaut floating in space without his body leaving the ground. He creates magic by simple means and lends everyday objects a transforming poetry. He starts in a laundromat, where a spin-drier's circular aperture becomes the equivalent of Alice in Wonderland's rabbit hole and in time transmutes into the dead mother's prized goldfish bowl, an aeroplane window and a revolving moon. </p> <p>The ingenious effects, however, are always at the service of an idea: in particular, that contraries can be synthesised and that emotional loss can be turned into spiritual gain. The most affecting scenes are those in which Lepage shows the two brothers coping in different ways with their mother's death. The introspective Philippe nervously dons her dress while the bumptious weatherman goes down to the gym.

      "bodyText": "The timing is perfect. Forty years after the first manned orbit of the earth Robert Lepage brings us a one-man show about space exploration. But, being a Lepage show, it is as much about inner as outer space. Part of its magic lies in its combination of emotional fervour and technical wizardry. In a sense two stories are being told. On a public level Lepage recalls the competitive Soviet-American moon-race, which he sees largely as an exercise in national vanity. In the private sphere, Lepage tells of two warring Quebec brothers brought together by their mother's death. One is a shy philosopher struggling with a thesis on the influence of space exploration on popular culture; the other is a gay, extrovert TV weatherman who takes a pragmatic view of the galaxy's mysteries. And, just as the 1975 joint Apollo-Soyuz mission brought together the rival nations, so the fractious brothers are finally reconciled. I sometimes feel with Lepage that his theatrical legerdemain outstrips his ideas. But here style and content work in perfect harmony as he explores the notion that individuals and nations can offer mirror images of each other. The show's key metaphor is of reflecting surfaces and it reaches an astonishing climax in a scene where Lepage simulates an astronaut floating in space without his body leaving the ground. He creates magic by simple means and lends everyday objects a transforming poetry. He starts in a laundromat, where a spin-drier's circular aperture becomes the equivalent of Alice in Wonderland's rabbit hole and in time transmutes into the dead mother's prized goldfish bowl, an aeroplane window and a revolving moon. The ingenious effects, however, are always at the service of an idea: in particular, that contraries can be synthesised and that emotional loss can be turned into spiritual gain. The most affecting scenes are those in which Lepage shows the two brothers coping in different ways with their mother's death. The introspective Philippe nervously dons her dress while the bumptious weatherman goes down to the gym. Just as they are harmonised, so too Lepage suggests that all life is about the reconciliation of apparent opposites. In one scene he suggests that even doctor and patient are two sides of the same moon. Lepage, as performer, not only taps into his own multi-facetedness but even revealed, on the first night, a surprising ability to deal with a heckler. Technically this is a one-man show, but it is reinforced by the poignant mystery of Laurie Anderson's music, by Pierre Bernier's puppeteering skill and by the proficiency of numerous technicians.

Football League officials had received several anonymous telephone calls warning them that not all was what it appeared in the way the club ran its affairs, from the method of paying players to the way it declared its gate receipts. </p> <p>For at least two months prior to Bean's visit Football League officials began monitoring the gate receipts registered by Chesterfield. All league clubs have to file their attendance figures and gate receipts on a weekly basis to league headquarters in Preston, Lancashire. The league charges a 3% levy on all gate receipts, which goes into a central fund. </p> <p>Despite the fact that Chesterfield were riding high at the top of the Third Division and enjoying healthy crowds, league officials noticed that this did not tally with the amount the club claimed to be taking in gate receipts. At times Chesterfield would register an attendance of 7,000 to 8,000 but would reveal gate receipts for a crowd averaging 4,000. </p> <p>The shortfall, combined with growing gossip and the anonymous telephone calls, eventually prompted the FA and the Football League to form a team of investigators and send them to Chesterfield. The ensuing investigation led to around 90 charges being brought against 18 players, the team manager Nicky Law and Brown, who stepped down as chairman last month. </p> <p>The majority were not proven by the inquiry panel at Hillsborough, such as illegal payments to players and an illegal payment of \u00a310,000 to an agent. </p> <p>The failure to report the right gate receipts and giving a player, Luke Beckett, two contracts, however, were proven and for this the club were found guilty of breaching Football League guidelines. </p> <p>The whole affair has taken on more sinister and complicated tones with the involvement of the police, prompting two separate investigations: one by the Derbyshire police fraud squad into the running of Chesterfield and another into intimidation of witnesses. </p> <p>This week Andy Marples, an acountant who worked for Brown and Chesterfield, was arrested at his home, where a number of documents and computer discs were seized. Marples was later released, pending further inquiries. </p> <p>Derbyshire police have also sent a file to the Crown Prosecution Service about possible charges of witness intimidation. Officers were called in when it emerged that witness statements presented to the joint FA/Football League inquiry were distributed to Chesterfield fans at a local pub in the hope they would intimidate those giving evidence at the Hillsborough inquiry. </p> <p>The role of Brown has been pivotal in the complicated myriad of allegations that have tainted the name of Chesterfield. But question marks over his management extend well beyond the world of football and, indeed, financial problems appear to be a hallmark of the charismatic chairman with almost every sports concern he has been involved in. </p> <p>Brown, aged 29 and the head of a printing company, took over at Chesterfield last year. Throughout the affair he has denied any allegations of wrong doing. Since stepping down as chairman he has also stepped down as head of his UK Sports Group, which owns the ice hockey teams Sheffield Steelers and Hull Thunder. </p> <p>Brown was recently banned by ice hockey's Superleague for his \"total mismanagement\" of the Sheffield Steelers, who are facing financial ruin, leaving behind a string of creditors. The Derbyshire police fraud squad is also investigating the running of the Steelers. The Sheffield Sharks basketball team, another former concern of Brown's, are also trying to overcome financial problems. </p> <p>It is with Chesterfield, however, that Brown's presence has had the most devastating impact, given that it has cost the club so dear. </p> <p>In statements that were presented to the inquiry, the club director Dean Newman revealed the deal surrounding Beckett's two contracts. </p> <p>Beckett was signed from Chester City last summer after the tribunal set a fee of \u00a3150,000. At that hearing Chesterfield presented a contract for the player that showed he was to earn \u00a3500 per week and receive a \u00a321,000 signing-on fee. However, this was just to reduce his transfer fee. Beckett's real contract showed that he earned \u00a31,000 per week and received a \u00a354,000 signing-on fee. </p> <p>Newman said in evidence: \"I asked Ian Banks [Law's assistant] why Beckett had two contracts. Ian said that when they were at the tribunal to set Beckett's transfer fee, Luke's agent had said that one of the tribunal's determining factors when setting the fee was the player's contract terms. If it looked as though Beckett was earning less that he actually was and there were no signing-on fees involved, this would significantly reduce the transfer fee Chesterfield would have to pay.\" </p> <p>The commercial manager James Brown told the inquiry in his statement that players received cash in envelopes. He said: \"I know of at least one cash bonus being paid to players.\" Ultimately the inquiry panel felt there was not enough evidence to convict on this charge. </p> <p>Referring to a match with Exeter, his statement reads: \"Sharon Wood, who was then manager of Blue on the Move [the Chesterfield lottery], used my office at half-time to count out some money and put it into envelopes. She told me, 'Darren Brown's got me doing this'. I understand at the time that each player was to receive about \u00a3600.\" </p> <p>The inquiry also heard that at least three of the turnstiles at Saltergate were not connected to a main computer that records attendance figures and that cash was collected at these particular turnstiles. Wood ran Blues on the Move to raise money for a new stadium or to renovate dilapidated Saltergate. She told the inquiry in her statement: \"I was involved in the payment of cash bonuses to the team managers and certain players and I knew that the cash used for that bonus came out of the gate receipts from a home match against Exeter.\" </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

I remember having a young Mark Hughes in that position at Old Trafford. </p> <p>Now the depth of squad is such that United, Arsenal and Liverpool have four top-class strikers. At Panathinaikos in the Champions League, Ferguson was able to take off Cole, throw on Solskjaer and Teddy Sheringham alongside Dwight Yorke and watch United get a last-minute equaliser.

He can come on with fresh life and vitality and be a surprise package, as he showed by scoring against Romania at the 1998 World Cup and in Paris last year against France. </p> <p>Of course, bigger benches make it easier for managers to keep players happy. I recall how disappointed Steve McCall, Garry Parker and others were be left out of the 13 for Aston Villa's 1994 League Cup final against United because I could only name two substitutes. </p> <p>But even with only one change at your disposal a manager could turn a game, as Bob Paisley showed with Fairclough. I remember making a decisive substitution for United when we playing Everton in the sixth round of the FA Cup in 1983 at Old Trafford. </p> <p>We were drawing 0-0 with 30 seconds remaining when we won a corner. As a last throw of the dice I decided to put on Lou Macari, who was in the veteran stage but still capable of an impact. Micky Duxbury came over to ask who was coming off and I said: \"You are, you're the nearest.\" </p> <p>Lou ran straight into the box, got up and won a header from which Frank Stapleton volleyed the winner. People were saying what a masterstroke it was, but it was more a bit of jam. </p> <p>So many of Solskjaer's contributions from the bench have been less flukey. He picks up the pace of a game very quickly and when you talk to people at Old Trafford they will tell you he is the best finisher on the books. </p> <p>He's not a great combination player and I'm not always sure United's play benefits in terms of overall quality when he's in the side.

When I took United to the 1983 Charity Shield, Joe Fagan made a change for Liverpool as we were preparing to take a corner. The replacement ran on and before he had got into position or picked up the tempo, Bryan Robson scored. That taught me not to change things when you're defending a set-play in the last third. </p> <p>But the classic misfiring substitution came at the 1970 World Cup, when England were leading Germany 2-0.

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair yesterday set the government an ambitious goal of eventually delivering levels of spending on state schools to rival the independent sector. In a speech to the Association of Teachers and Lecturers' conference in Torquay, the prime minister called on delegates to help him persuade voters of the case for investment in public services rather than tax cuts as he pledged real term increases in education spending \"year on year on year on year\". He said: \"My aim and objective is to get to a situation where you have a state education system that's as good in its facilities and investment as the independent sector. I think that's really what children need.\" The government would need to increase the \u00a323bn spent on education in England to around \u00a340bn this year to match levels in independent schools. Funding per pupil this year is at \u00a33,690, compared with typical independent school fees of \u00a35,700 for day pupils.

When ATL delegate Ruksana Hussain, a trainee, asked him to deliver a \u00a320,000 starting salary for teachers, Mr Blair said there were other expenditure demands to meet as well.

Extended nationwide the scheme will make a dramatic impact on the life-chances of disadvantaged young people. </p> <p>If they remain in full-time education, an EMA of up to \u00a340 a week is awarded to 16 to 19-year-olds whose parents' income is less than \u00a330,000. An additional bonus (\u00a350) is granted when learning targets are achieved. A new smart card will record points earned for achieving learning goals and entitle the student to a range of goodies - a free session at the swimming pool, even a fast food voucher. In exchange, the student must sign a contract pledging full attendance and completion of assignments. If the contract is broken, the payment is forfeited. </p> <p>EMAs have encouraged on average an additional 5% of young people from low-income families to stay in full-time education. They have been extremely effective with boys - an additional 6% in urban and 10.9% in rural areas resisted the temptation to flee the classroom. The very poorest students seem to have benefited the most. An extra 7% of students eligible for the full award stayed on compared to 2.9% of students with higher parental income. EMAs have also reduced the number of drop-outs. One college reported a 92% retention rate among EMA students compared to the average rate of 85%. </p> <p>The educational achievement of boys has been the subject of increasing concern. Their disaffection may be exacerbated by the perceived \"feminisation\" of education. Women outnumber men as teachers and girls are outperforming boys. The cash payment may mean that their masculine credentials are no longer compromised by staying at school while their mates celebrate their first pay packet. Cash payment has proved to be the most effective incentive for men to become teachers. The number of male applicants for teacher training courses has risen at approximately twice the rate of female applicants since the introduction of the \u00a36,000 bursary. </p> <p>The success of cash incentives may be linked to the increasing numbers of young people in part-time work while in full-time education. A recent survey puts the figure at 75-80% of 16 to 19-year-olds. A quarter of children under 13 and 35% of 13-year-olds have had paid jobs in the last year. The phenomenon is self-perpetuating. The \"earning\" majority will determine the income level required for the social activities of the peer group. Young people become rapidly accustomed to the extra money. Work has a more central role in the lives of young people than ever before. </p> <p>The learning contract is often perceived as the stick to counter the cash carrot. But it may elevate the status of full-time study by officially recognising the value of what both parties contribute to the deal - the state's investment in the individual and the learner's efforts. The learning agreement mimics an employee contract, stating targets, defined expectations and stronger incentives. </p> <p>The tight labour market has prompted many employers to promise relatively good career prospects to the young recruits they are eager to retain. So why should the young employee not only jeopardise a regular income and a promising career path but also incur thousands of pounds of debt to continue their education? </p> <p>Risk is a key factor. Further or higher education is a much riskier option for the disadvantaged than the middle-class student. Research shows that most graduates are guaranteed a high wage premium. Yet rates of return carry little weight in the absence of successful graduate role models. </p> <p>A degree may be a sound investment but its an unknown quantity for many young people. Uncertainty about standards expected at college and a profound lack of self-confidence compound the risk factor. The social and financial capital of the middle class provides a safety net and a second chance in case something goes wrong. For students from disadvantaged backgrounds, the stakes are much higher. </p> <p>Although consumer debt has risen by 60% in past years, focus groups suggest that the majority are still highly averse to borrowing for learning. According to the Citizens Advice Bureau increasing numbers of people are experiencing difficul ties in managing their debts. The cruel irony persists that the most disadvantaged often acquire them on the least advantageous terms. </p> <p>There are significant differences in perception of borrowing amongst different social groups. Debt is still stigmatised in many working-class communities while it is often viewed as investment or credit by the middle classes. The fact that loans with interest are effectively prohibited by Muslims for cultural and religious reasons may account for the fact that only 51% of Asian students took out a loan compared to the national average of 72%. </p> <p>Debt aversion may be preventing the very groups that the government is targeting from pursuing their education. Two-thirds of the respondents to a recent survey for the Department for Education and Employment claimed that a member of their peer group had opted not to go into higher education due to worries about debt. This was asserted most strongly by black students and those from social classes IV and V. Such reports inevitably overestimate the extent of hardship. But irrespective of reality, the perception of student life as a financial struggle and confusion over student support deters the disadvantaged. The majority are not aware of the fact that almost 50% are exempt from fees. </p> <p>The government's argument that individuals should take responsibility for investing in their own learning is persuasive. However, some groups face a powerful phalanx of deterrents and need much stronger support.

      "body": "<p>Until now, Phoebe Philo has only ever designed one collection of her own. In 1996, then aged 22, Philo left London's famed fashion college, Central St Martins, with a 2:1 degree and a graduation show of Latino influence and huge gold jewellery which showed her ability both to cut and to style. It has taken five years but Philo is starting to prepare her second presentation, only now it is for higher stakes. This week, it was announced that she is to take over from her friend Stella McCartney as creative director at Chloe. </p> <p>These days, fashion houses usually want a big name to bring to the label their own widely-recognised style. When Alexander McQueen got the job at Givenchy, for instance, everyone knew to expect a version of his usual shock tactics and strong-shouldered trouser suits. In 1997, at McCartney's Chloe debut, the mix of contemporary and antique was no surprise, as she had already designed a couple of widely-publicised collections at her west London flat. But this time around, neither industry insiders nor the legions of women who buy the Chloe label knows what to expect, as Philo has never been tested in public. </p> <p>Of course, anyone who has followed McCartney's rise will know of Philo, the trusted collaborator who joined her in Paris to help make the ateliers at Chloe feel like home. The pair stripped back the offices to the floorboards and stuck magazine cutouts on the wall to make their \"crazy freak zone\", which apparently included images of Isabella Blow and Karl Lagerfeld, and a photo of Phoebe and Stella captioned \"Baby Spice and Ginger Spice on da piss\". </p> <p>They became friends at St Martins where McCartney had been in the year above Philo on the BA course in Fashion Design, Womenswear. From there, both graduated with the kind of accomplished collections destined to lead to jobs in the industry. </p> <p>Though Philo's degree show was said to be beautiful, it gained no coverage, and the file on her work at St Martins has since gone missing. In contrast, McCartney's collection featured Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell, was attended by her mother and father, Linda and Paul McCartney, and the next day was splashed all over the national press. </p> <p>Philo, from Harrow-on-the-Hill, was then heavily influenced by the ragga look or, as she has described it, \"hardcore little LA bitches with black lipstick, the sort you wouldn't mess around with\". At the time, she was sporting a set of gold teeth. \"I wanted to get a council flat, wear sovereigns and have a laugh, and I did for a while.\" </p> <p>McCartney, however, describes Philo as \"a bit posher than me. I always take the piss out of her.\" </p> <p>Philo shares McCartney's love of horses. \"If I wasn't in fashion, then I'd like to be an Olympic showjumper. It takes more dedication than money. You have to be up at 3.30 in the morning, whatever the weather.\" </p> <p>On graduating, Philo found work assisting Pam Blundell, half of the London label Copperwheat Blundell, before McCartney asked her to help out on her fledgling label. \"We spent the afternoons in her garage, or if the weather was good we would work in the garden, wearing our bikinis,\" she says. </p> <p>When McCartney was head-hunted by Chloe in March 1997, Philo was not expecting to go with her, but less than a year after her own graduation, she was in discussion with Chloe about her salary. \"I remember going to see them about my contract and thinking, what are you doing? What are you going to say?\" she says. \"Breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth.\" </p> <p>At the time, Philo's role with McCartney was described by The Face as \"stylist, friend, casting adviser, therapist, muse and right-hand woman\". But, she says: \"I really put my heels down about being her PA.\" </p> <p>Throughout her time at Chloe, there have been rumours about the size of Philo's contribution to the overall collection. Many have suggested her role at the label was more than that of just muse. Indeed, when Chloe president Ralph Toledano spoke about his new creative director earlier in the week, he seemed to back the rumours by stating: \"On the one side, we all love Stella, but on the other it is important for the house to maintain its identity. With Phoebe, we will continue in the same direction.\" </p> <p>During the pair's time to gether at Chloe, Philo was indignant about the stories. \"I've heard those bullshit stories about designers who don't see the collection until five minutes before it comes out,\" she says. She also claimed then that she didn't have any interest in being a designer in her own right. \"It's hard because I've seen Stella do it. I don't like the press thing, the infatuation with celebrities. But I don't feel I'm holding back. This is a great experience at the end of the day.\" </p> <p>Something seems to have changed. At last month's Chloe show as part of the autumn/ winter 2001 collections, many noticed an interesting disparity between the invite and the collection itself. With their ticket, fashion editors were sent an acid house-style stress ball, a yellow smiley-faced rubbery man wearing a Chloe top. Many people expected a rave-inspired collection, but instead the clothes were sober, mature and gimmick-free. It was as if someone's influence, previously so valuable to the house, had suddenly been cast aside. According to Toledano, Philo was the only candidate to replace her friend and had no intention of ever jumping ship with McCartney. Tellingly, while McCartney would not touch animal products, Philo is prepared to work with both leather and fur. Time will tell whether their friendship can survive such a difference of opinion. </p> <p>Anticipation is already building for the next round of catwalk shows, where the collections by the former collaborators will be studied and analysed for their similarities and differences. McCartney will hope to cast aside once and for all the doubts about her own genuine abilities, while Philo will make her first tentative steps as the head, rather than the helper. The previously publicity-shy Philo had better steel herself, for the fashion world loves a battle. The clash between the two, whether or not intended, is going to be a damaging affair.</p>",

Indeed, when Chloe president Ralph Toledano spoke about his new creative director earlier in the week, he seemed to back the rumours by stating: \"On the one side, we all love Stella, but on the other it is important for the house to maintain its identity. With Phoebe, we will continue in the same direction.\" During the pair's time to gether at Chloe, Philo was indignant about the stories. \"I've heard those bullshit stories about designers who don't see the collection until five minutes before it comes out,\" she says. She also claimed then that she didn't have any interest in being a designer in her own right. \"It's hard because I've seen Stella do it. I don't like the press thing, the infatuation with celebrities. But I don't feel I'm holding back. This is a great experience at the end of the day.\" Something seems to have changed. At last month's Chloe show as part of the autumn/ winter 2001 collections, many noticed an interesting disparity between the invite and the collection itself. With their ticket, fashion editors were sent an acid house-style stress ball, a yellow smiley-faced rubbery man wearing a Chloe top. Many people expected a rave-inspired collection, but instead the clothes were sober, mature and gimmick-free. It was as if someone's influence, previously so valuable to the house, had suddenly been cast aside. According to Toledano, Philo was the only candidate to replace her friend and had no intention of ever jumping ship with McCartney. Tellingly, while McCartney would not touch animal products, Philo is prepared to work with both leather and fur. Time will tell whether their friendship can survive such a difference of opinion. Anticipation is already building for the next round of catwalk shows, where the collections by the former collaborators will be studied and analysed for their similarities and differences. McCartney will hope to cast aside once and for all the doubts about her own genuine abilities, while Philo will make her first tentative steps as the head, rather than the helper. The previously publicity-shy Philo had better steel herself, for the fashion world loves a battle. The clash between the two, whether or not intended, is going to be a damaging affair.",

      "body": "<p>Ren\u00e9e Zellweger would rather have a headache. \"I wish I was hungover from last night honey, I wish .\" She flops into an armchair and crosses her legs for emphasis. \"I didn't really have the chance to get a drink. I went over to the bar at one point and carried the glass around for the rest of the night.\" She fits her fists to her hips and bellows hysterically, a pocket Calamity Jane. It is the morning after the night before. The premiere of Bridget Jones's Diary was a noisy, glossy affair. But who was she most excited to meet? The mothers of Helen Fielding (\"who looks exactly like her\") and Richard Curtis (\"very sweet\") get top billing. She doesn't have to act delightful. </p> <p>Zellweger is in rude good health. Her apple cheeks are scrubbed and rosy, her deep-set eyes shine like damp diamonds. And yes, she is thin - tiny-waisted, pre-teen-chested. Her arms are covered by a long-sleeved top but I'll warrant her triceps are well-defined. Riffing on her assistant's new hairstyle, she throws out: \"This is much more interesting than some dumb actress prattling on about her experiences with pizza !\" She's laughing, but she spits the word like it's swearing. </p> <p>Of course, Zellweger's experiences with pizza have taken on mythic proportions. In order to play the eponymous heroine in the film of Helen Fielding's bestseller, the actress gained 17lb, consulting a dietician and endocrinologist who devised a regime of three full meals a day, multiple snacks and no exercise. </p> <p>According to the film's costume designer, Rachael Fleming, Zellweger would wail \"I'm so fat! I'm so fat!\" each day, comparing her stomach with that of Fleming, who was eight months pregnant. Rumour has it that Harper's Bazaar magazine refused to use her on their cover because she was too heavy, though Zellweger herself politely deflects this with the explanation that she was tired at the time of the shoot and \"probably looked like road kill\". But recent press reports that she has declined to sign up for a sequel have inevitably been interpreted in the light of the perils of a full fridge. </p> <p>Yet onscreen, the results of her De Niro-esque efforts are little short of astounding. It is as shocking as it is joyous to watch Bridget's thighs dimple as she hoicks herself into a gargantuan pair of tummy control pants and realise that you have never - not once - seen cellulite on the big screen before. She looks real - fleshy, female, sexy as hell. It's a triumphant transformation to observe, if not to undergo. </p> <p>As a whole, 32-year-old Zellweger's performance is rather magnificent. It's a tough call to translate a character as phenomenal and ubiquitous as Bridget Jones, and she meets the challenge amply. Though her vowels are a little more Pony Club than you would have imagined, she crystallises the character's combination of good-hearted vulnerability, knowing hopelessness and game humour impressively. Not bad for the Texan who ignited Little Englander angst when she was chosen for the role over the likes of Kate Winslet, inciting London's Evening Standard to liken the casting to \"remaking The Elephant Man with Jude Law\". </p> <p>While she doesn't dismiss the weight of expectation, she frames it in terms of responsibility: \"The pressure was more of an internal thing, it was a respect for Helen Fielding and what she'd created and an understanding that I was not alone in loving this character.\" She often betrays a fretful concern that others won't be let down by her. When talking seriously, she sets her knees together and gazes with intensity, all homespun polite and girl-friendly confidences. Her voice is deliciously twangy, with the breath control of Monroe. She's an intelligent, if rambling conversationalist, layering clauses and images. </p> <p>\"Obviously I related to the female aspect [of the character], her day-to-day regimen and fight against Mother Nature. On a more significant level, I'm about to enter the stage of life that Bridget is experiencing and I, like so many people, understood her quest. I understood her search for self-acceptance and her daily attempt to define what is going to bring her happiness in life, her struggle to differentiate between what it is that she wants for her life and what it is that society expects from her.\" </p> <p>What does society expect from women of Zellweger's age? \"It's changing, and it's really an interesting time right now. Bridget is of the last generation that is trying to slip through that antiquated social definition of success regarding women, in terms of being the cornerstone of a nurturing family unit; in other words if you don't get married and you're not celebrated in that regard by a man, then you've failed in some way.\" </p> <p>It is also significant that her generation doesn't regard women's increasing visibility in positions of power as being unusual. \"They don't see that as, 'Oh, isn't it great that there's a female secretary of state, a female governor in Texas.' So the ceiling has been presented: here's what you can achieve now as a woman in terms of family and home, and here's what you can achieve in terms of contributing professionally in society. So you want to do both, right? And if you don't reach the ceiling in one or the other or both, have you failed in some way?\" </p> <p>One charge regularly levelled against the character she plays is that she is reductive, regressive, portraying women as neurotic, self-obsessed and man-mad. How does she answer critics who say Bridget is an anti-feminist construct? \"She faces those dilemmas with humour. She's aware that she's self-aware, which makes her not pathetic, and she's self- deprecating but in a humorous way that makes her not loathsome and not superficial. It's wonderful that Helen Fielding is so honest about our insecurities as human beings.\" </p> <p>Nor are those insecurities gender-specific, she argues. \"If you look at it on a superficial level, yes it is about a woman and her daily challenges and her laughing about these things that ultimately shouldn't matter. But if you look deeper, it goes way beyond that, and it's not age-specific or culturally specific either. It's the search for who you are, trying to define yourself and really figure out what makes you happy in life.\" </p> <p>\"I don't think [Bridget Jones is] a setback for women. If you look through the course of the book, and the film as well, she really comes into her own on her own. She decides to be happy now and not in some projected myth of what the future might hold and the happiness that might bring. She blossoms, and if that's not a positive feminist message, I don't know what is.\" </p> <p>Born and raised in Katy, a country town in Texas, Zellweger studied English at university before moving to Los Angeles to pursue her acting career. She was championed by Tom Cruise, who chose her to play his love interest in the film Jerry Maguire and credited her with \"revealing the core humanity of the movie\". Lately, Zellweger has branched off into comedy, making Me, Myself and Irene with Jim Carrey, whom she dated for a year before the couple split up last December, and winning a Golden Globe for her role as a soap-opera obsessive in Nurse Betty. She is curious, she says, rather than ambitious. \"Yeah, I want to be able to take care of myself, so I will really work hard in order to able to achieve that. But I'm not ambitious for that myth of what success is. I'm not trying to get anywhere.\" </p> <p>And is she really so bored of talking about her pizza intake? \"I understand why it's interesting,\" she drawls with heavy irony, \"and believe me, for the first week it was very interesting, going to DiMario's every day.\" She switches to an itty-bitty baby voice: \" 'Yes, I would like the pizza, and the garlic bread too, because it's my responsibility, and I'll have the cream sauce linguine, for the good of the film, and a chocolate shake, and a Guinness.'

      "bodyText": "Ren\u00e9e Zellweger would rather have a headache. \"I wish I was hungover from last night honey, I wish .\" She flops into an armchair and crosses her legs for emphasis. \"I didn't really have the chance to get a drink. I went over to the bar at one point and carried the glass around for the rest of the night.\" She fits her fists to her hips and bellows hysterically, a pocket Calamity Jane. It is the morning after the night before. The premiere of Bridget Jones's Diary was a noisy, glossy affair. But who was she most excited to meet? The mothers of Helen Fielding (\"who looks exactly like her\") and Richard Curtis (\"very sweet\") get top billing. She doesn't have to act delightful. Zellweger is in rude good health. Her apple cheeks are scrubbed and rosy, her deep-set eyes shine like damp diamonds. And yes, she is thin - tiny-waisted, pre-teen-chested. Her arms are covered by a long-sleeved top but I'll warrant her triceps are well-defined. Riffing on her assistant's new hairstyle, she throws out: \"This is much more interesting than some dumb actress prattling on about her experiences with pizza !\" She's laughing, but she spits the word like it's swearing. Of course, Zellweger's experiences with pizza have taken on mythic proportions. In order to play the eponymous heroine in the film of Helen Fielding's bestseller, the actress gained 17lb, consulting a dietician and endocrinologist who devised a regime of three full meals a day, multiple snacks and no exercise. According to the film's costume designer, Rachael Fleming, Zellweger would wail \"I'm so fat! I'm so fat!\" each day, comparing her stomach with that of Fleming, who was eight months pregnant. Rumour has it that Harper's Bazaar magazine refused to use her on their cover because she was too heavy, though Zellweger herself politely deflects this with the explanation that she was tired at the time of the shoot and \"probably looked like road kill\". But recent press reports that she has declined to sign up for a sequel have inevitably been interpreted in the light of the perils of a full fridge. Yet onscreen, the results of her De Niro-esque efforts are little short of astounding. It is as shocking as it is joyous to watch Bridget's thighs dimple as she hoicks herself into a gargantuan pair of tummy control pants and realise that you have never - not once - seen cellulite on the big screen before. She looks real - fleshy, female, sexy as hell. It's a triumphant transformation to observe, if not to undergo. As a whole, 32-year-old Zellweger's performance is rather magnificent. It's a tough call to translate a character as phenomenal and ubiquitous as Bridget Jones, and she meets the challenge amply. Though her vowels are a little more Pony Club than you would have imagined, she crystallises the character's combination of good-hearted vulnerability, knowing hopelessness and game humour impressively. Not bad for the Texan who ignited Little Englander angst when she was chosen for the role over the likes of Kate Winslet, inciting London's Evening Standard to liken the casting to \"remaking The Elephant Man with Jude Law\". While she doesn't dismiss the weight of expectation, she frames it in terms of responsibility: \"The pressure was more of an internal thing, it was a respect for Helen Fielding and what she'd created and an understanding that I was not alone in loving this character.\" She often betrays a fretful concern that others won't be let down by her. When talking seriously, she sets her knees together and gazes with intensity, all homespun polite and girl-friendly confidences. Her voice is deliciously twangy, with the breath control of Monroe. She's an intelligent, if rambling conversationalist, layering clauses and images. \"Obviously I related to the female aspect [of the character], her day-to-day regimen and fight against Mother Nature. On a more significant level, I'm about to enter the stage of life that Bridget is experiencing and I, like so many people, understood her quest. I understood her search for self-acceptance and her daily attempt to define what is going to bring her happiness in life, her struggle to differentiate between what it is that she wants for her life and what it is that society expects from her.\" What does society expect from women of Zellweger's age? \"It's changing, and it's really an interesting time right now. Bridget is of the last generation that is trying to slip through that antiquated social definition of success regarding women, in terms of being the cornerstone of a nurturing family unit; in other words if you don't get married and you're not celebrated in that regard by a man, then you've failed in some way.\" It is also significant that her generation doesn't regard women's increasing visibility in positions of power as being unusual. \"They don't see that as, 'Oh, isn't it great that there's a female secretary of state, a female governor in Texas.' So the ceiling has been presented: here's what you can achieve now as a woman in terms of family and home, and here's what you can achieve in terms of contributing professionally in society. So you want to do both, right? And if you don't reach the ceiling in one or the other or both, have you failed in some way?\" One charge regularly levelled against the character she plays is that she is reductive, regressive, portraying women as neurotic, self-obsessed and man-mad. How does she answer critics who say Bridget is an anti-feminist construct? \"She faces those dilemmas with humour. She's aware that she's self-aware, which makes her not pathetic, and she's self- deprecating but in a humorous way that makes her not loathsome and not superficial. It's wonderful that Helen Fielding is so honest about our insecurities as human beings.\" Nor are those insecurities gender-specific, she argues. \"If you look at it on a superficial level, yes it is about a woman and her daily challenges and her laughing about these things that ultimately shouldn't matter. But if you look deeper, it goes way beyond that, and it's not age-specific or culturally specific either. It's the search for who you are, trying to define yourself and really figure out what makes you happy in life.\" \"I don't think [Bridget Jones is] a setback for women. If you look through the course of the book, and the film as well, she really comes into her own on her own. She decides to be happy now and not in some projected myth of what the future might hold and the happiness that might bring. She blossoms, and if that's not a positive feminist message, I don't know what is.\" Born and raised in Katy, a country town in Texas, Zellweger studied English at university before moving to Los Angeles to pursue her acting career. She was championed by Tom Cruise, who chose her to play his love interest in the film Jerry Maguire and credited her with \"revealing the core humanity of the movie\". Lately, Zellweger has branched off into comedy, making Me, Myself and Irene with Jim Carrey, whom she dated for a year before the couple split up last December, and winning a Golden Globe for her role as a soap-opera obsessive in Nurse Betty. She is curious, she says, rather than ambitious. \"Yeah, I want to be able to take care of myself, so I will really work hard in order to able to achieve that. But I'm not ambitious for that myth of what success is. I'm not trying to get anywhere.\" And is she really so bored of talking about her pizza intake? \"I understand why it's interesting,\" she drawls with heavy irony, \"and believe me, for the first week it was very interesting, going to DiMario's every day.\" She switches to an itty-bitty baby voice: \" 'Yes, I would like the pizza, and the garlic bread too, because it's my responsibility, and I'll have the cream sauce linguine, for the good of the film, and a chocolate shake, and a Guinness.' I understand the intrigue. It sounds like it would be such a liberating experience, but I hope that that won't be what becomes most important.\" Does she think that British women are more aware of body image issues than their American counterparts? \"I'd say the contrary, although it's specific to particular subcultures, because each subculture values different qualities in physicality. Where I live, for example, there is probably a hyper-awareness of health and how to maintain health. In most places in the world,\" she says, taking a schoolmarmish tone, \"it's very exciting if you just have enough to eat and you've fed your family and you don't run out before everyone's had seconds.\" So was Bridget - and consequently herself playing Bridget - fat? \"No,\" she says wearily. \"She has a different body type to me, but it reflects the different lifestyles that we lead, and that's what she chooses.

      "body": "<p>We enter Leicester Square at noon, posing in white coats as researchers from the \"British Tourist Centre\". I carry a clipboard, and my colleague Neil Chatterjee lugs a tray of mildewy gas masks hired from an army surplus shop in north London. Our intention is to find out how American tourists perceive the foot and mouth crisis by asking them questions, then offering them a gas mask. Will we be instantly rumbled as pranksters? Or will the white coats and monstrous respirators fit so neatly into the visitors' view of Britain that they pass unnoticed?</p> <p>First up is Wade from Oklahoma. He is standing with his elderly parents in a queue for West End theatre tickets. With impeccable manners, Wade pretends not to notice the lab coats and breathing apparatus - or at least fails to ask what we, tourism researchers, might be doing with them. Wade made a will shortly before coming to Britain. Yes, he says, he was warned about the dangers of the British countryside. \"You have all sorts of venereal disease out there,\" he says kindly. \"And, of course, hoof and mouth.\" Because of the rumours, he and his parents haven't ventured beyond zone 6 of the London underground. \"You get bloated,\" says Wade's mum. \"Then you run through the streets screaming.\" And how does one contract the disease? \"They don't tell us,\" says Wade, darkly. \"But we know not to eat brain.\" Each would be prepared to suffer a short period of quarantine before returning to the US, although not in a British hospital. As we part, Wade's dad winks and tips me a dollar.</p> <p>Outside the National Portrait Gallery, Janis and Cari from Washington consider the question: \"Would you feel safe drinking British milk?\" They have shown a thorough knowledge of BSE as well as foot and mouth, and are aware that the latter doesn't affect humans. None the less, Janis, an account executive, has grave doubts about British dairy products. \"In the US, milk is, like, 2% fat,\" she says, skilfully conflating issues. \"But you all drink whole milk. So I would probably avoid it.\" I ask them what they would do if they saw a cow behaving strangely. \"We would tell someone,\" says Cari confidently. What about a sheep? \"Same thing.\" And a pigeon? \"Well, I keep parakeets,\" says Cari, \"so I'm quite familiar with bird behaviour. If I saw a pigeon acting strangely in Trafalgar Square, I would definitely contact the authorities. You remember that puppy we found in Fort Worth, Janis? I always try to help sick animals.\"</p> <p>This is Neil's cue to step forward with the gas masks. \"What's this?\" asks Janis. It's a promotion, I say. Free gas masks for foreign visitors. The two women eye them suspiciously. Janis reaches for a rubber strap and, coming down on the side of like, immediately brightens. \"Cool!\" she says. \"Can I really have one?\" Sadly I am forced to reply: no, it is just a little Tourist Centre joke.</p> <p>And so we adjourn to Trafalgar Square, where, before we can approach any tourists, Neil and I are rounded on by a bouncer in a neon vest known as a \"heritage warden\". Blinking rapidly, he tries to locate our behaviour within the framework of civil disobedience. \"What's this?\" he asks, scrutinising the masks for signs of illegal trading. I give him the Tourist Centre line. \"You're asking people about foot and mouth disease?\" he repeats slowly, eyes narrowing. Yes, I reply. Thinking about it for a moment, he concludes: \"That's for a newspaper, isn't it?\" The warden has rumbled us, and while he radios his supervisor with news of \"two journalists carrying questionnaires and, er, gas masks\", we make a dash for it up the steps, across three lanes of traffic and smack into a garment-centre executive and her family, from New York.</p> <p>It is inevitable, in a survey such as this, that you will at some stage stub your toe against a very smart kid. Ben is it. The 13-year-old answers our questions with the authority of one who reads the foreign papers online. \"It's airborne,\" he says precociously. \"But you can also spread it by foot.\" And what are the symptoms? \"You start acting crazy - but that's only for mad cow disease. Foot and mouth can't hurt humans.\" He looks at me with wonder. \"You didn't know that?\" I ask if the US could ever succumb to such an epidemic. Ben's unblinking blue eyes grow wide and grave. \"People are very ignorant and stubborn in America. Sure it could happen.\" \"Especially with George Bush as president,\" his mother chips in with a flippancy lost on her son, who, with thankful recourse to childishness, has pulled on one of the gas masks and can be heard exclaiming \"Cool!\" through the muffled rubber. Thoroughly unnerved, I move on by taxi to the queue outside Madame Tussaud's.</p> <p>Here I find Nick and Julie from Minnesota. Nick is a windscreen technician; Julie works in an accounts department. Since arriving in Britain 10 days ago, the couple have drunk only bottled water - nothing to do with the farming crisis, which Julie mistakenly perceives as some kind of tourist attraction. \"Foot and mouth?\" she says. \"Oh no. We figured there's enough to do in the countryside without getting into that. We're not planning a special visit.\" Um, what about foot and mouth the highly contagious disease, I venture. \"Is that the one where you have to burn your shoes?\" asks Julie, but before we can get to the bottom of it, a Tussaud's steward has thrown me out of the queue. \"Would you like a gas mask?\" I ask hopefully, as we're ushered away. Julie gives me a very cold look. \"No.\"</p> <p>And so, finally, to Paddington station, where we are just in time to meet Amy and Carly, from Maryland, off the Heathrow Express. They are wilting under the weight of their backpacks, but energised enough to tell me about the time Amy's mum came to Britain and got sick from the water. \"As a nurse,\" says Amy, \"I obviously have to know about this foot and mouth stuff.\" Carly, a student, nods approvingly. \"The key thing is to wash your hands. That is the best - the only - way to avoid getting it.\" Carly clears her throat. \"Don't eat the beef!\" she adds unexpectedly. I ask how a person knows if they've got the disease. \"You get a rash around your mouth,\" says Amy. \"That kind of thing.\" Carly opens her mouth to protest, but is silenced by her friend. \"I'm a nurse,\" says Amy, chuckling. \"I should know!\" The offer of a gas mask prompts Amy to pat my arm. \"Bless your heart,\" she says, apparently touched, and, shaking her head at the endless sweetness of the Brits, looks about for an exit.</p> <p><b>Foot in mouth? Our survey said . . .</b><br><br> These are some of the questions Emma Brockes asked Americans in her survey, with a selection of their replies:</p> <p><b>How do you think foot and mouth disease is contracted?</b></p> <p>\"You catch it by touching cows' feet. You can stroke the rump, but if you make contact with the actual hoof, you're in trouble.\"</p> <p>Marian, high-school physics teacher, New York</p> <p>\"The air conditioning. Also, if you touch your mouth a lot without washing your hands first.\"</p> <p>Carly, student, Maryland</p> <p>\"From eating bad beef or lamb, or walking across farmland.\"</p> <p>Kelly, marketing assistant, Chicago</p> <p><b> What are the symptoms of foot and mouth disease?</b></p> <p>\"You get really bad blisters on your feet and some swelling around the neck area.\"</p> <p>Mary, maths teacher, Chicago</p> <p>\"You start to drool and shake your head a lot. You might feel a little dizzy.\"</p> <p>Pamela, administrative assistant, Wisconsin</p> <p>\"Nausea, dizziness, headaches. You would probably start vomiting a lot.\"</p> <p>Kelly, marketing manager, Chicago</p> <p>\"You get very big and bloated.\"</p> <p>Nancy, retired, Oklahoma</p> <p>\"You start acting crazy.\"</p> <p>Cate, executive, New York</p> <p>\"Humans can't catch it, but the cow starts to feel nauseous - that much I know.\"</p> <p>Jim, fireman, California</p> <p><b> What precautions should you take before entering the British countryside and after you've arrived there?</b></p> <p>\"If you're taking an animal for a walk, you should stick to one side of the street. Never cross the street with an animal during an epidemic.\"</p> <p>Wade, consultant, Oklahoma</p> <p>\"When you're in the countryside, always stay on the sidewalk. You have to walk through things, both ways, to make sure you're clean.\"</p> <p>Rocky, social worker, Missouri</p> <p>\"Don't visit a zoo before you go and don't pick the flowers when you get there, because they could be infected.\"</p> <p>Julie, accountant, Minnesota</p> <p>\"You should probably stay on the coach.\"</p> <p>Cate, executive, New York</p> <p><b> What is the best time of day to disinfect yourself?</b></p> <p>\"In the evening, after a shower.\"</p> <p>Janis, account executive, Washington</p> <p>\"I would say in the morning, when you've just got up and are still fresh.\"</p> <p>Kelly, marketing assistant, Chicago</p> <p><b> Is it safe to drink the water in Britain, and if you fell ill would you be happy to use a British hospital?</b></p> <p>\"The hospitals, sure, but I'm not certain about the water. As a precaution I've been boiling it since I got here.\"</p> <p>Barbara, high-school principal, Virginia</p> <p>\"We only drink bottled water in Britain, but we clean our teeth with water from the tap. Will we be OK?\"</p> <p>Diane, sales assistant, California</p> <p>\"An English hospital is better than nothing, but only just. I've read about your cleanliness and sanitation.

      "bodyText": "We enter Leicester Square at noon, posing in white coats as researchers from the \"British Tourist Centre\". I carry a clipboard, and my colleague Neil Chatterjee lugs a tray of mildewy gas masks hired from an army surplus shop in north London. Our intention is to find out how American tourists perceive the foot and mouth crisis by asking them questions, then offering them a gas mask. Will we be instantly rumbled as pranksters? Or will the white coats and monstrous respirators fit so neatly into the visitors' view of Britain that they pass unnoticed? First up is Wade from Oklahoma. He is standing with his elderly parents in a queue for West End theatre tickets. With impeccable manners, Wade pretends not to notice the lab coats and breathing apparatus - or at least fails to ask what we, tourism researchers, might be doing with them. Wade made a will shortly before coming to Britain. Yes, he says, he was warned about the dangers of the British countryside. \"You have all sorts of venereal disease out there,\" he says kindly. \"And, of course, hoof and mouth.\" Because of the rumours, he and his parents haven't ventured beyond zone 6 of the London underground. \"You get bloated,\" says Wade's mum. \"Then you run through the streets screaming.\" And how does one contract the disease? \"They don't tell us,\" says Wade, darkly. \"But we know not to eat brain.\" Each would be prepared to suffer a short period of quarantine before returning to the US, although not in a British hospital. As we part, Wade's dad winks and tips me a dollar. Outside the National Portrait Gallery, Janis and Cari from Washington consider the question: \"Would you feel safe drinking British milk?\" They have shown a thorough knowledge of BSE as well as foot and mouth, and are aware that the latter doesn't affect humans. None the less, Janis, an account executive, has grave doubts about British dairy products. \"In the US, milk is, like, 2% fat,\" she says, skilfully conflating issues. \"But you all drink whole milk. So I would probably avoid it.\" I ask them what they would do if they saw a cow behaving strangely. \"We would tell someone,\" says Cari confidently. What about a sheep? \"Same thing.\" And a pigeon? \"Well, I keep parakeets,\" says Cari, \"so I'm quite familiar with bird behaviour. If I saw a pigeon acting strangely in Trafalgar Square, I would definitely contact the authorities. You remember that puppy we found in Fort Worth, Janis? I always try to help sick animals.\" This is Neil's cue to step forward with the gas masks. \"What's this?\" asks Janis. It's a promotion, I say. Free gas masks for foreign visitors. The two women eye them suspiciously. Janis reaches for a rubber strap and, coming down on the side of like, immediately brightens. \"Cool!\" she says. \"Can I really have one?\" Sadly I am forced to reply: no, it is just a little Tourist Centre joke. And so we adjourn to Trafalgar Square, where, before we can approach any tourists, Neil and I are rounded on by a bouncer in a neon vest known as a \"heritage warden\". Blinking rapidly, he tries to locate our behaviour within the framework of civil disobedience. \"What's this?\" he asks, scrutinising the masks for signs of illegal trading. I give him the Tourist Centre line. \"You're asking people about foot and mouth disease?\" he repeats slowly, eyes narrowing. Yes, I reply. Thinking about it for a moment, he concludes: \"That's for a newspaper, isn't it?\" The warden has rumbled us, and while he radios his supervisor with news of \"two journalists carrying questionnaires and, er, gas masks\", we make a dash for it up the steps, across three lanes of traffic and smack into a garment-centre executive and her family, from New York. It is inevitable, in a survey such as this, that you will at some stage stub your toe against a very smart kid. Ben is it. The 13-year-old answers our questions with the authority of one who reads the foreign papers online. \"It's airborne,\" he says precociously. \"But you can also spread it by foot.\" And what are the symptoms? \"You start acting crazy - but that's only for mad cow disease. Foot and mouth can't hurt humans.\" He looks at me with wonder. \"You didn't know that?\" I ask if the US could ever succumb to such an epidemic. Ben's unblinking blue eyes grow wide and grave. \"People are very ignorant and stubborn in America. Sure it could happen.\" \"Especially with George Bush as president,\" his mother chips in with a flippancy lost on her son, who, with thankful recourse to childishness, has pulled on one of the gas masks and can be heard exclaiming \"Cool!\" through the muffled rubber. Thoroughly unnerved, I move on by taxi to the queue outside Madame Tussaud's. Here I find Nick and Julie from Minnesota. Nick is a windscreen technician; Julie works in an accounts department. Since arriving in Britain 10 days ago, the couple have drunk only bottled water - nothing to do with the farming crisis, which Julie mistakenly perceives as some kind of tourist attraction. \"Foot and mouth?\" she says. \"Oh no. We figured there's enough to do in the countryside without getting into that. We're not planning a special visit.\" Um, what about foot and mouth the highly contagious disease, I venture. \"Is that the one where you have to burn your shoes?\" asks Julie, but before we can get to the bottom of it, a Tussaud's steward has thrown me out of the queue. \"Would you like a gas mask?\" I ask hopefully, as we're ushered away. Julie gives me a very cold look. \"No.\" And so, finally, to Paddington station, where we are just in time to meet Amy and Carly, from Maryland, off the Heathrow Express. They are wilting under the weight of their backpacks, but energised enough to tell me about the time Amy's mum came to Britain and got sick from the water. \"As a nurse,\" says Amy, \"I obviously have to know about this foot and mouth stuff.\" Carly, a student, nods approvingly. \"The key thing is to wash your hands. That is the best - the only - way to avoid getting it.\" Carly clears her throat. \"Don't eat the beef!\" she adds unexpectedly. I ask how a person knows if they've got the disease. \"You get a rash around your mouth,\" says Amy. \"That kind of thing.\" Carly opens her mouth to protest, but is silenced by her friend. \"I'm a nurse,\" says Amy, chuckling. \"I should know!\" The offer of a gas mask prompts Amy to pat my arm. \"Bless your heart,\" she says, apparently touched, and, shaking her head at the endless sweetness of the Brits, looks about for an exit. Foot in mouth? Our survey said . . . These are some of the questions Emma Brockes asked Americans in her survey, with a selection of their replies: How do you think foot and mouth disease is contracted? \"You catch it by touching cows' feet. You can stroke the rump, but if you make contact with the actual hoof, you're in trouble.\" Marian, high-school physics teacher, New York \"The air conditioning. Also, if you touch your mouth a lot without washing your hands first.\" Carly, student, Maryland \"From eating bad beef or lamb, or walking across farmland.\" Kelly, marketing assistant, Chicago What are the symptoms of foot and mouth disease? \"You get really bad blisters on your feet and some swelling around the neck area.\" Mary, maths teacher, Chicago \"You start to drool and shake your head a lot. You might feel a little dizzy.\" Pamela, administrative assistant, Wisconsin \"Nausea, dizziness, headaches. You would probably start vomiting a lot.\" Kelly, marketing manager, Chicago \"You get very big and bloated.\" Nancy, retired, Oklahoma \"You start acting crazy.\" Cate, executive, New York \"Humans can't catch it, but the cow starts to feel nauseous - that much I know.\" Jim, fireman, California What precautions should you take before entering the British countryside and after you've arrived there? \"If you're taking an animal for a walk, you should stick to one side of the street. Never cross the street with an animal during an epidemic.\" Wade, consultant, Oklahoma \"When you're in the countryside, always stay on the sidewalk. You have to walk through things, both ways, to make sure you're clean.\" Rocky, social worker, Missouri \"Don't visit a zoo before you go and don't pick the flowers when you get there, because they could be infected.\" Julie, accountant, Minnesota \"You should probably stay on the coach.\" Cate, executive, New York What is the best time of day to disinfect yourself? \"In the evening, after a shower.\" Janis, account executive, Washington \"I would say in the morning, when you've just got up and are still fresh.\" Kelly, marketing assistant, Chicago Is it safe to drink the water in Britain, and if you fell ill would you be happy to use a British hospital? \"The hospitals, sure, but I'm not certain about the water. As a precaution I've been boiling it since I got here.\" Barbara, high-school principal, Virginia \"We only drink bottled water in Britain, but we clean our teeth with water from the tap. Will we be OK?\" Diane, sales assistant, California \"An English hospital is better than nothing, but only just. I've read about your cleanliness and sanitation. I guess if I was dying I'd take my chances, but I'd rather be flown back to the States. Still, I think it's a wonderful country you have here and I intend to come back.\" Marian, high-school physics teacher, New York Email update Sign up for our free daily foot and mouth round-up More on the election and foot and mouth Politics: foot and mouth What's going on?

That is perilous for the peace process, for Sinn Fein is currently undergoing one of those fantasist phases peculiar to the ideologically blinkered.</p> <p>This particular fantasy has been brought on by a wave of demographic speculation about the outcome of this month's census, which is widely expected to show the Catholic proportion of the population at around 46%.</p> <p>Already, Sinn Fein theorists are dreaming out loud about ten-yearly referenda in which the province will be asked whether it wants to stay part of the UK or unite with the Republic. The first one, they say mistily, would almost certainly produce a pro-British result. Ah, but the next...</p> <p>This is cock-and-bull of the most dangerous kind. To begin with, there is no certainty that Catholics will attain a majority, given their dramatically declining birthrate. Secondly, a pro-unity vote would not wipe out the divisions of Ireland, but amplify them enormously.</p> <p>For if Britain (pop 59m) cannot contain the discontent of 0.75m Northern Ireland Catholics, how could a united Ireland (pop 5.75m) hope to contain the discontent of nearly a million Protestants?</p> <p>Both these developments - the general election and the census - are diversions from the main issue, which is devising a system of governance which both communities in Northern Ireland, and both sovereign governments in London and Dublin, can endorse and trust.</p> <p>The bones of such a system are in place, and indeed have a fair amount of flesh on them. The months ahead should see rapid progress towards police reform and cross border cooperation. They will also, of a dismal certainty, see renewed efforts by the hard men on both sides to destroy what has taken three painful years to build.</p> <p><a href=\"MAIL TO:DBROWN445@AOL.COM\">dbrown445@aol.com</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/nireland\" target=\"_NEW\">Special report: Northern Ireland</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.uup.org\" target=\"_new\">Ulster Unionists</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.dup.org.uk\" target=\"_new\">Democratic Unionist party</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.pup.org/\" target=\"_new\" http: sinnfein.ie\">Sinn Fein</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.indigo.ie/sdlp\" target=\"_new\">Social Democratic and Labour party</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.nio.gov.uk/agreement.htm\" target=\"_new\">Good Friday agreement</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk\" target=\"_new\">Belfast Telegraph </a> <br> <a href=\"http://scripts.ireland.com/tardis.plx?main=newspaper/front\" target=\"_new\">Irish Times</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.irishnews.com\" target=\"_new\">Irish News</a> <br> <a href=\"http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/index.html\" target=\"_new\">Cain (Conflict Archive on the Internet)</a> <br></p>",

On the loyalist side, Trimble's Ulster Unionists are under withering fire not only from the Rev Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionist party, but from a dissident wing within the party almost slaveringly eager to replace Trimble as leader. On the nationalist side, Sinn Fein is poised to become a bigger electoral force than the moderately nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party. That is perilous for the peace process, for Sinn Fein is currently undergoing one of those fantasist phases peculiar to the ideologically blinkered. This particular fantasy has been brought on by a wave of demographic speculation about the outcome of this month's census, which is widely expected to show the Catholic proportion of the population at around 46%. Already, Sinn Fein theorists are dreaming out loud about ten-yearly referenda in which the province will be asked whether it wants to stay part of the UK or unite with the Republic. The first one, they say mistily, would almost certainly produce a pro-British result. Ah, but the next... This is cock-and-bull of the most dangerous kind. To begin with, there is no certainty that Catholics will attain a majority, given their dramatically declining birthrate. Secondly, a pro-unity vote would not wipe out the divisions of Ireland, but amplify them enormously. For if Britain (pop 59m) cannot contain the discontent of 0.75m Northern Ireland Catholics, how could a united Ireland (pop 5.75m) hope to contain the discontent of nearly a million Protestants? Both these developments - the general election and the census - are diversions from the main issue, which is devising a system of governance which both communities in Northern Ireland, and both sovereign governments in London and Dublin, can endorse and trust. The bones of such a system are in place, and indeed have a fair amount of flesh on them. The months ahead should see rapid progress towards police reform and cross border cooperation. They will also, of a dismal certainty, see renewed efforts by the hard men on both sides to destroy what has taken three painful years to build. dbrown445@aol.com Useful links Special report: Northern Ireland Ulster Unionists Democratic Unionist party Sinn Fein Social Democratic and Labour party Good Friday agreement Belfast Telegraph Irish Times Irish News Cain (Conflict Archive on the Internet)",

      "body": "<p>Usually, by this time of the year, the town is studded with trippers. You can always tell the visitors: they're the ones strolling slowly through the town, peering into shop windows, with cameras slung round their necks, and ordnance survey maps peeping out of their pockets.</p> <p>The good news is that the spring migration has started. The predictable bad news is that it looks more like a trickle than a flood.</p> <p><b>The butcher </b></p> <p>John Kench's family butcher's shop on the high street (Topside, we call it) is strategically situated opposite the little tourist inquiry office in the Guildhall. \"I've started to get them coming in. You can't always tell, but there are certain signs. If it's someone you haven't seen before and they look a bit lost and then they say they want a jar of honey and a pound of sausages, it's a fair bet you've got weekenders or people staying in a holiday cottage,\" he said.</p> <p>John is in cheery mood. His business has picked up steadily since the early days of the crisis and after a couple of excellent weekends, Easter looks like bringing bumper interest in his all-British stock. Prices and supplies are still stable, too, with the curious exception of chickens - entirely unaffected by foot and mouth - which have become inexplicably dearer.</p> <p><b>The supermarket manager </b></p> <p>Tony Hatch at the Co-op supermarket has yet to see any real sign of the sales increase which normally goes with the start of the tourist season proper. \"I'm still hoping for a bit of a pick-up. My biggest fear is that nobody will be coming to the countryside, and then we will lose that icing on the cake. Still, we seem to be doing roughly what we did this time last year,\" he said.</p> <p>The Co-op is now back to selling mainly British meat. Though there is still New Zealand lamb on the shelves, bold notices proclaim that all beef and pork is now home-produced.</p> <p><b>The restaurateur </b></p> <p>There was a bustle of activity this lunchtime in Stones, the smart bar-restaurant in the town centre. But alas it wasn't a sudden influx of tourists, but rather the draw for two giant Easter eggs on behalf of the local Lions' Club. Owner Brian Galbraith, who has charmed and hustled his customers out of nearly \u00a3200 in the cause of charity, has enterprisingly rounded up the local press to cover the big event and garner some publicity for Stones. It needs it.</p> <p>\"It was another very poor Sunday again and the whole week's been very quiet,\" he said. And what of Easter bookings? Brian rolls his eyes heavenwards, and shakes his head briefly. Stones has been open only a few months and is still building up a local clientele. It seriously depends on a passing trade which, for two months now, has simply not materialised.</p> <p><b>The farmer </b></p> <p>Marilyn Ivings at Mill Farm in Church Enstone, has some unqualified good news to pass on. \"I got on to the internet on Monday and pulled down an application form for an occasional movement licence. I took it to Chadlington on Tuesday morning for the vet to sign it. He faxed it into the ministry at Reading at quarter to two on Wednesday and they faxed it back at twenty to three,\" she said.</p> <p>\"People are quick enough to sling brickbats at them, so they deserve credit when they do the job as well as this. I think it's absolutely wonderful.\"</p> <p>The licence will allow Marilyn to move her stock of suckler cows and newborn calves from their sheds on to fresh pasture which is only less than half a kilometre away, on the other side of a public road.</p> <p>Meanwhile, a sheep farming neighbour is not allowed to move his ewes, which are about to lamb, from the field where they have spent the winter, to the lambing sheds on the other side of a small lane.

      "bodyText": "Usually, by this time of the year, the town is studded with trippers. You can always tell the visitors: they're the ones strolling slowly through the town, peering into shop windows, with cameras slung round their necks, and ordnance survey maps peeping out of their pockets. The good news is that the spring migration has started. The predictable bad news is that it looks more like a trickle than a flood. The butcher John Kench's family butcher's shop on the high street (Topside, we call it) is strategically situated opposite the little tourist inquiry office in the Guildhall. \"I've started to get them coming in. You can't always tell, but there are certain signs. If it's someone you haven't seen before and they look a bit lost and then they say they want a jar of honey and a pound of sausages, it's a fair bet you've got weekenders or people staying in a holiday cottage,\" he said. John is in cheery mood. His business has picked up steadily since the early days of the crisis and after a couple of excellent weekends, Easter looks like bringing bumper interest in his all-British stock. Prices and supplies are still stable, too, with the curious exception of chickens - entirely unaffected by foot and mouth - which have become inexplicably dearer. The supermarket manager Tony Hatch at the Co-op supermarket has yet to see any real sign of the sales increase which normally goes with the start of the tourist season proper. \"I'm still hoping for a bit of a pick-up. My biggest fear is that nobody will be coming to the countryside, and then we will lose that icing on the cake. Still, we seem to be doing roughly what we did this time last year,\" he said. The Co-op is now back to selling mainly British meat. Though there is still New Zealand lamb on the shelves, bold notices proclaim that all beef and pork is now home-produced. The restaurateur There was a bustle of activity this lunchtime in Stones, the smart bar-restaurant in the town centre. But alas it wasn't a sudden influx of tourists, but rather the draw for two giant Easter eggs on behalf of the local Lions' Club. Owner Brian Galbraith, who has charmed and hustled his customers out of nearly \u00a3200 in the cause of charity, has enterprisingly rounded up the local press to cover the big event and garner some publicity for Stones. It needs it. \"It was another very poor Sunday again and the whole week's been very quiet,\" he said. And what of Easter bookings? Brian rolls his eyes heavenwards, and shakes his head briefly. Stones has been open only a few months and is still building up a local clientele. It seriously depends on a passing trade which, for two months now, has simply not materialised. The farmer Marilyn Ivings at Mill Farm in Church Enstone, has some unqualified good news to pass on. \"I got on to the internet on Monday and pulled down an application form for an occasional movement licence. I took it to Chadlington on Tuesday morning for the vet to sign it. He faxed it into the ministry at Reading at quarter to two on Wednesday and they faxed it back at twenty to three,\" she said. \"People are quick enough to sling brickbats at them, so they deserve credit when they do the job as well as this. I think it's absolutely wonderful.\" The licence will allow Marilyn to move her stock of suckler cows and newborn calves from their sheds on to fresh pasture which is only less than half a kilometre away, on the other side of a public road. Meanwhile, a sheep farming neighbour is not allowed to move his ewes, which are about to lamb, from the field where they have spent the winter, to the lambing sheds on the other side of a small lane. Still, the ewes are in infinitely better shape than the ones regularly pictured on television, mired in mud only yards away from fresh green grass. dbrown445@aol.com Email update Sign up for our free daily foot and mouth round-up More on the election and foot and mouth Politics: foot and mouth What's going on? 13.04.2001: The state of play in Britain - where you can go this Easter 11.04.2001: Foot and mouth in Europe Full list: outbreaks Graph: rise in cases Full list: closed &amp; cancelled Causes and effects The issue explained The front line: meet those affected by the crisis 10.04.2001: Hoping that Easter can resurrect trade 06.03.2001: Meet our panel Related articles 13.04.2001: Third of British farms could be infected 13.04.2001: Exodus as 1.5m take flight to warmer climes 13.04.2001: Town appalled by massive pyre 13.04.2001: Forest of Dean cull fails to halt disease 13.04.2001: Double trouble Interactive guides How the virus spread across Britain The countryside in crisis From the Guardian archive 28.11.1967, leader: indecision on foot and mouth 18.11.1967: 'Slaughter must seem a cruel remedy' 16.11.1967: Foot and mouth may cost agriculture more than \u00a312m Graphics Map: The spread of the disease (week 4) Map of confirmed cases so far Computerised image of the virus Cartoons Steve Bell on how pigs will fly Steve Bell on Hague going over the top Photo gallery The story in pictures Talk about it What do you think?

The big institutional investors in BT are waiting anxiously for further details of the timing of the \u00a35bn cash call. </p> <p>Other telecoms companies were unable to join BT in ending the day higher. Vodafone lost 3p to 216p and Cable &amp; Wireless was off 15p at 515p. </p> <p>Among the other stocks to experience the roller-coaster ride associated with the new technology was Baltimore, which lost another 20%, down 18p to 74p after frightening the market with a sales warning. </p> <p>With such alerts seeming to be increasingly common across the Atlantic, further anxieties about the overall health of the American economy yesterday did little to boost sentiment ahead of the Easter break. </p> <p>One of last year's trendy stocks did manage to buck the sluggish sentiment. ARM Holdings put on another 19p to \u00a33.27 after exciting the market on Wednesday with its first-quarter results and not sounding a gloomy siren. </p> <p>The retailer GUS did its bit to maintain the upward momentum - gaining 24p to 525p - but another member of the retailing sector, WH Smith, had little to cheer about after suffering an 8% price fall to \u00a34.85 as its profits, announced yesterday, were dented by sale of the newspaper distribution arm.</p>",

It was Alliance &amp; Leicester that felt most of the pain in the sector, losing some 17p to 772p after rapid gains in recent days on reheated speculation that National Australia Bank was preparing a bid for the former building society. Meanwhile, Bank of Scotland, which some City sources insist is the real target for NAB after the failed talks with Abbey, was unmoved at 720p. Overall, it was a modest day in volume terms as the City's biggest dealers took advantage of the extended Easter holiday by leaving their desks early but not before pushing through some trades in BT - which rose 6p to 576p. The big institutional investors in BT are waiting anxiously for further details of the timing of the \u00a35bn cash call. Other telecoms companies were unable to join BT in ending the day higher. Vodafone lost 3p to 216p and Cable &amp; Wireless was off 15p at 515p. Among the other stocks to experience the roller-coaster ride associated with the new technology was Baltimore, which lost another 20%, down 18p to 74p after frightening the market with a sales warning. With such alerts seeming to be increasingly common across the Atlantic, further anxieties about the overall health of the American economy yesterday did little to boost sentiment ahead of the Easter break. One of last year's trendy stocks did manage to buck the sluggish sentiment. ARM Holdings put on another 19p to \u00a33.27 after exciting the market on Wednesday with its first-quarter results and not sounding a gloomy siren. The retailer GUS did its bit to maintain the upward momentum - gaining 24p to 525p - but another member of the retailing sector, WH Smith, had little to cheer about after suffering an 8% price fall to \u00a34.85 as its profits, announced yesterday, were dented by sale of the newspaper distribution arm.",

      "bodyText": "Anna Diamantopoulou, the European commissioner for social policy and employment, has been making waves - upsetting those who think \"Brussels\" should mind its own business, but encouraging others who want the EU to set standards across the union. Galvanised into action by a spate of high-profile job losses, she is demanding loudly that bosses be legally required to consult their workers before undertaking major changes. \"I cannot remain silent,\" Ms Diamantopolou protested when over 6,000 employees of the British retailer Marks and Spencer and the French biscuit manufacturer Danone heard -via the media - that they were being sacked. \"It is unworthy of Europe that employees have to learn about their redundancy through the press or only a few minutes before a public announcement,\" the Greek commissioner complained. Ms Diamantopoulou was not the only person upset by these decisions - widely condemned as the behaviour of overpaid managers restructuring underperforming firms with blithe indifference to the human consequences. French prime minister Lionel Jospin weighed in to express his disquiet - and, sensing the public mood, floated the idea of making it harder for profitable firms to dismiss employees. Angry demonstrations in the streets of Paris were not just about the impending disappearance of delectable M&amp;S chicken tikka sandwiches or chocolate eclairs. In Belgium, where no one has forgotten the infamous mass layoffs at the Renault factory at Vilvoorde, near Brussels, a few years ago, a court then ruled that the closure of four branches of the retailer had breached national labour laws. And when a French court followed suit over 18 M&amp;S outlets, Diamantopoulou spoke out again. \"In the new economic environment,\" she warned, \"business must look not only to shareholders but to its main stakeholders: the workforce.\" Brussels insiders were not surprised by this strident tone. The commissioner has one of the most sensitive portfolios in Romano Prodi's team. And in an institution that is sometimes accused of wanting only to liberalise the European economy while being indifferent to the interests of labour, this proud \"business-friendly\" Eurocrat has become a voice - if not for the underdog, then at least for a \"social model\" that takes workers' interests into account. This is not easy. The supranational commission - along with the EU's 15 member states - is committed to giving Europe, which already has a single market and single currency, the \"most dynamic knowledge-based economy\" in the world by 2010. It has ambitious though slow-moving plans to create continent-wide labour markets by encouraging the skills, job mobility and flexibility that are needed to compete with the US. On the other hand, the latest redundancies are a timely boost for the commission's case for legislation on consulting and informing workers - already common on the continent. If Ms Diamantopoulou gets her way, governments will soon have to adopt harmonised rules for consultation procedures between management and employers in companies of more than 50 employees operating at national level. Britain, Ireland, Denmark and Germany are currently against the draft directive that lays down the rules. But crucially, the matter has to be decided by majority voting. And so if, as widely predicted, there is a change of position by Germany - the key player because of its size - it could go through in June, shortly after a UK general election. Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder is said to have promised Tony Blair that he would delay any change until after a May poll. But with the election put off because of the foot and mouth crisis, it is not clear whether that still holds. Opposing this directive is central to Blair's view of the EU: such practices must be decided at the national, not European level, he insists. \"Flawed\" EU proposals are not appropriate for Britain because its corporate structures are different from on the continent. This is a real irritant because Blair has managed to clear away many contentious European issues likely to be exploited by the Tories in the run-up to an election, not least by standing firm against demands to surrender national vetos at last December's Nice summit. The Trades Union Congress disagrees with the prime minister, pointing out that Britain has the highest rate of mergers and takeovers in Europe - and the least regulated workers. And if the directive had been in force, the TUC argues, it would have prevented cases like those of General Motors' Luton plant, where the media were first with news of 2,000 job losses, or Corus in south Wales in February, where management secrecy enraged the government. \"British ministers could end this shameful practice of keeping workers in the dark by putting pen to paper and signing the information and consultation directive,\" argues Bill Morris, general secretary of the Transport and General Workers Union. On the other side of the barricades, the CBI is dead against the directive, which it says would make British business less competitive, even though it backs a government review of how redundancy arrangements are made. \"But is is important to remember that while consultation can affect the way redundancies are handled, it often cannot change the harsh commercial realities that lie behind the decision,\" the employers organisation warned recently. Ms Diamantopoulou has been hinting heavily at flexibility over the final version of her proposals. Britain insists, however, that it will not change tack. Yet there was further evidence of the need for clearer, binding rules only this week, when Motorola announced 3000 job losses in Scotland's \"Silicon Glen\", prompting emergency intervention from Downing Street. \"We are pleased the prime minister found time to place a call to Motorola - but if this is the way we are going to conduct industrial relations in 2001, he will never be off the phone,\" said Jimmy Elsby, TGWU assistant general secretary. \"If the prime minister sat down and signed the draft EU directive, companies would be required to discuss their plans with their workers and the PM could save himself the price of a call.\" Email ian.black@theguardian.com Related special reports European integration Economic and monetary union European commission European parliament Related articles 05.04.2001, Paris dispatch: Sparks fly over M&amp;S closures Other articles More articles by Ian Black Useful links EUROPA (European government home page) Le Monde Le Soir S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung El Pais La Stampa Aftonbladet Euro links - Guardian Unlimited Emu net FAQ's on European issues More European links IT and the Euro",

Yet the truth is that \"one China\" has become something of a diplomatic fiction. Smarting from Hainan, it would not be surprising if Bush is preparing to start challenging the fiction with the fact.

      "body": "<p>Joe Fiennes is having another bad day. While Naomi Campbell grows impatient for his company in London - and the lady is not one for waiting - he is stuck on a scorching hot Balkan mountain top, the air thick with every sort of biting and stinging insect. The brain begins to boil at about 42 degrees celsius (108 fahrenheit) - and, this morning, with forest fires raging on the horizon, the temperature is touching a barely believable 50. Joe won't be getting to London any time soon. </p> <p>Today, though, he gets to give his Australian co-star David Wenham a good kicking. You can hear the dull thud of boot on rib as soon as you leave the shade of the ancient Orthodox monastery of Treskovec in southern Macedonia and snake your way up through the tinder-dry alpine meadow strewn with Byzantine rubble to the baking rock of the summit. </p> <p>Wenham is writhing in the dust, coughing and spluttering, surrounded by a halo of wasps. Fiennes, unshaven, irritable and obviously relishing the prospect of another day stewing in his own sweat, kicks him in the stomach, grinds the heel of his cowboy boot down on Wenham's hand and drawls: \"You never were no good, Luke.\" </p> <p>This goes on, with a short break for lunch and an adjustment of Wenham's bandages, from 9am until after 8pm. By then, even Milcho Manchevski (the man who persuaded them to \"come to Macedonia and be in my 'eastern' - it'll be fun\") has had enough. And this was one of the good days on the set of Dust, the first \"baklava western\". Even by the tortuous standards of movie-making, this was a bizarre and horrendous shoot - Apocalypse Now without the luxury of a studio budget. </p> <p>The omens were not good. From day one, the crew began dropping like flies from dysentery and a medical dictionary of equally nasty complaints - even the unit doctor invalided himself out. Then it got weirder. A week before I arrived, as the worst heatwave to hit the Balkans in 30 years added sunstroke to the sick list, a flock of marauding sheep, half-demented with thirst, overran the set. These being Balkan sheep, there were casualties. A few days later, several people were badly stung by thousands of wasps drawn to the watermelons bought to keep the surviving crew from expiring. The swarm was followed by plagues of mosquitoes and horse flies. </p> <p>Then came dark mutterings from the Macedonians on the crew of a government plot. Wasn't it strange how, as the thermometers on set screeched towards 50 degrees celsius, each night on the state TV news the temperature never topped 42 - the level above which a national emergency would have to be declared and all work stop? </p> <p>It was as if the film - a Cain and Abel, id versus ego, parable of two cowboy brothers from the old American west who bring their deadly filial feud to Macedonia when they enlist as mercenaries on opposing sides during the first Balkan war of 1912 - had incurred the wrath of the Almighty. If it sounds like something only Sam Peckinpah might have attempted, you'd be right. But then old Sam always claimed to have the devil on his side. </p> <p>Everything, including Nato, seems to have conspired against Dust and its dramatic historical sweep from the badlands of Arizona to bandit-ravaged turn-of-the-century Bitola, where the young Ataturk fought in vain to keep the Macedonia of his birth under Ottoman control. As final preparations for filming began in the spring of 1999, war broke out in neighbouring Kosovo and frightened the money away. Manchevski's pleas to be allowed to go ahead were drowned out by the roar of American B52s passing overhead on their way to pulverise Pristina. </p> <p>There was one other unquantifiable factor at work here almost as fiery as the weather. For, presiding over this surreal Fitzcarraldo in a huge cartoon stetson hat was the enigmatic figure of Manchevski himself, a former punk from the Macedonian capital of Skopje, who walked off the set of his last film after only a fortnight because he claimed its Hollywood producer thought \"she had a bigger dick than me\". And yes, those immortal words \"He'll never work in this town again\" - or ones very like them - were indeed uttered by Laura \"Pretty Woman\" Ziskin after that spectacular falling out on the cannibal flick Ravenous. (Tellingly, the crew rebelled against Manchevski's replacement and Ravenous was eventually finished by the British director Antonia Bird, who maintains that its problems were not of Manchevski's making. \"He'd been stitched up big time, in my opinion.\") </p> <p>Even shorn of his green mohican, Manchevski cuts quite a figure. Only someone with a highly developed sense of the ridiculous could stride on to a set in a joke cowboy hat and badass shades, with a vast pashmina shawl draped around his narrow shoulders, and expect to take charge. First impressions, of course, can be very deceptive. Manchevski may have picked up the swagger, and that eccentric dress sense, directing pop videos in America for the likes of Arrested Development, but he is no cocky fool. For he knew there was a lot more than money, or even whether he would be allowed behind a camera again, riding on Dust. </p> <p>\"I spent five and half years sweating blood to make this film,\" he says. \"I was making a shit-load of money trying to make studio films, but I just couldn't do it. You can't make good films that mean something by remote control. You couldn't make up what happens in LA, it's beyond satire. Hollywood is full of the most miserable, unhappy people I have ever met - and I'm from the Balkans.\" </p> <p>That little contretemps with Ziskin, arguably the most powerful woman in Hollywood, would have probably finished his career had Manchevski not had an Oscar nomination and won the Golden Lion at Venice for Before the Rain, his lyrical debut warning of what might happen if Macedonia followed the rest of the former Yugoslavia over the abyss into war. </p> <p>It is hard to underestimate the effect Before the Rain had on this tiny, fragile and fragmented country of 3m, with no obvious historical or ethnic precedents other than a shared reluctance from its either Slav or Albanian-speaking peoples to throw their lot in with the madhouses of Belgrade or Tirana. Macedonia - the word means \"mixed\" - also has Serb, Vlach, Roma and Bulgar minorities, making it in present Balkan terms more a conundrum than a country. In such disputed circumstances, Manchevski has become, unwittingly and unwillingly, more national talisman than mere film-maker. His perfectionism may make him a nightmare to work with at times, but in a country where cliques and political cabals hold sway, his unimpeachable punk contrariness has won him the trust of ordinary Macedonians. </p> <p>Until the skirmishes on the Kosovan border near Tetovo last month, both main Macedonian communities shared a fierce common pride in being the only former Yugoslav republic in which not a single shot had been fired in anger. The dreamlike Before the Rain, and its powerful appeal for tolerance, was the fairytale all ethnic groups seemed to have taken to heart. New countries need heroes, and Manchevski, the punk who ran away to the US \"as soon as I could\", and who cites the Sex Pistols as his greatest formative influence, was accidentally cast in the role of its chief iconographer. The prodigal son was being handed the mythic glue to hold the nation together - it was as if Malcolm McLaren was being asked to reinvent the monarchy. </p> <p>Dust - in which shifting alliances of Albanians, Bulgarians, Serbs, Turks, Greeks and various brigand bands battle for dominance as Macedonia emerges from five centuries of Ottoman rule - will be watched through that very delicate prism when it first sees the light of day at either the Cannes or the Venice film festivals; both are currently battling for the right to show it first. It is a fair bet that a few shadowy men from the Pentagon and the UN will want an early look, too. </p> <p>If that responsibility weighs heavily on Manchevski, he doesn't show it. Wiry, boyish and as charming as he is intense, even among his own he's a person apart, an effect intensified by a slightly off-centre pupil in one eye. No one knows much about his childhood in Skopje and he likes to keep it that way. </p> <p>His mischievous bluster, though, betrays a certain nervousness. \"I am an outsider. I was never part of any political or cultural establishment, even though in these parts you have to be because social life is so tribal. It's very like Hollywood, I guess. So I haven't had to sell my ass, which makes the government here suspicious of me. All this talk of civil war is crazy and dangerous. I really don't think it can happen. Then again, I said that about Bosnia. Macedonia is not Kosovo, you just can't compare how the Albanians have been treated in both places. I'll let you into a secret. That fighting in Tetovo is all my fault. I bribed them [the Albanian guerrillas] for publicity for the film and they just got a little carried away.\" </p> <p>Skopje airport has that uneasy feel of a place just out of earshot of something nasty. The flight from London was full of wary Americans and country casual Brits with Sandhurst accents pretending to be something in the City. </p> <p>A US Chinook helicopter thundered by as soon as we landed, lugging itself over the ammunition and fuel dumps that line the runway and out across the bristling weaponry dug into the fields beyond. It was bound for Kosovo, just beyond the ridge of mountains on the horizon where a low-level war is still raging. Systematic Serb ethnic cleansing of the long-suffering majority Albanian community has given way to slow and but equally cynical creation of an ethnically pure Albanian state. Nato keeps score with impeccable fairness. </p> <p>You can tell how close a country is to going belly-up when everyone with a car becomes a taxi driver. And everyone in the surging throng outside the doors of Skopje airport, except the Albanian women in scarves and ankle-length coats wrestling returning sons to their chests, was a taxi driver. </p> <p>Macedonia has paid a horrific price for allowing itself to be used as Nato's forward base against Milosevic. The blockade of Serbia, its main market, has destroyed its industry and the exodus of 400,000 Kosovan Albanian refugees threatened to upset its already delicate 65/30 ethnic balance between Orthodox Slavs and Muslim Albanians.

The Albanian gunmen, who mostly come from Kosovo, have got the crazy mistaken impression that the West bombed the Serbs so they could have their pure greater Albanian mega-state. It is a very similar situation to what the US got into with the Taliban in Afghanistan; a text-book example of 'blowback'. The West has created its own little jihad in Kosovo by arming the KLA.

It's been hell, but things are at last looking up,\" Chris Auty, the film's English co-producer assured me the night I arrived at their base in the dusty provincial town of Prilep. A few hours later Auty, a man of limitless optimism and good grace, was savaged by a mastiff on the doorstep of his hotel.</p> <p>He even managed a toothy smile as he limped, nauseous back onto set the next day at Treskovac after a double tetanus jab.

But Auty, an old Bertloucci hand, and no stranger to controversy having produced David Cronenberg's Crash, does not try to conceal that working with Manchevski, who admits a fondness for lobbing the occasional grenade to liven things up, has made the shoot \"one of life's more interesting experiences\".</p> <p>\"Milcho is Milcho, he's a one-off. I know it all going to be worth it because the guy is a genius, but it's been tough.

In fairness, nature could not have been more cruel, as well as the heat we have had every kind of plague she could have thrown at us.\"</p> <p>In another one of those little absurdities that surrounded Dust, and its grim merrygoround of racial conflict, there was more than the odd crackle of ethnic tension on set too.</p> <p>Playing Frisbee during a break in the filming at the monastery with a medieval copper plate a couple of the Macedonian crew members had found among the ancient ruins of the summit, I got of whiff of some simmering discontent among the natives.

Just as at Waterloo, I am proud to report that Blighty won the Battle of the Portaloos and British bog standards prevailed.</p> <p>The Western contingent was also a little sniffy about the crumbling of Soviet-era hotel in which they were billeted. My own room, which had a rather fetching little Gaudiesque tower of bird shit on balcony, was fine once you got used to the smell of diesel. Its greatest joy, however, was its socialist share-and-share-alike wardrobes, which opened into next door's closet.</p> <p>Having passed an uneasy night listening to my neighbours have non-stop sex, banging out the complete works of Shakespeare on the headboard in Morse, they invited me through the wardrobe in the morning to join them for a glass of sljivovice (plum brandy). Drago and Maria were married, but not to one another. He was a salesman and she was a friend of someone working on the film. Both were Macedonian Slavs and were keen to share their opinions of their Albanian brethren - lazy, criminal, backward, rich, drug-dealing mafiosi, bent on breeding their way to power was just about the gist of it. Even if there was truth in some of what they said - and there is no denying Macedonia's drug trade has blossomed since the economy collapsed - that sort of paranoia and casual bigotry has a horrible habit of ending in tears.</p> <p>Nor did their belief that Albanians were rolling in dough quite tally with the evidence of my own eyes. The Albanians in the streets of Prilep seemed markedly poorer, and had that look of people used to keeping their heads down.</p> <p>Manchevski warns about not seeing the sties in your own eye, but even he is highly critical of what he calls the \"anachronistic structures\" of Albanian life which he blames for allowing \"those men with machine guns in the hills above Tetova to hijack the whole concept of human rights. No one talks about the human rights of Albanian women, the way they are treated. They have absolutely no say, very few go to school, almost none work out of the house, it's like Afghanistan, for Heaven's sake. But you have seen them, in those long coats and scarves in 40-degree heat. When the world feels sorry for the Albanians, I think they should remember their grievances are not that great that they justify going to war. Macedonia is a state based on a proper co-habitation and toleration. The vice-president of parliament is an Albanian for Christ sake and six of the 17 ministers are too, plus deputy ministers of most ministries, the police, the army, a number of ambassadors. Macedonia is a very young country. It is true in the early days it had to strong line of Macedonian nationalism to set itself apart from Serbia, but that nationalism has been reined in now. There are many legitimate issues to be discussed, but what many Macedonians worry about is that when Albanians talk about human rights what they really want is secession. Albanian parties in Macedonia more often identify with ethnic Albanian causes in Kosovo or Albania than with the cause of the Macedonian state. They sit in the government, but act like foreign-state opposition. Either shit or get off the pot. These politicians have to decide if they want to be in this country or not.\"</p> <p>And Manchevski is a Macedonian liberal. His views on the gangsterism he sees spreading among rural Albanians, fears even some militant Albanians in Tetova privately share, are equally forthright. \"Too much has been made of this stuff about centuries' old hatreds. At least a part of the shooting is about local strongmen being able to keep their fiefdoms so there is open roads for smuggling, the drug trade and who runs the brothels and gets first go. It is that basic for a lot of these guys with the guns. If there is no structure anymore because everything is going up in smoke then they are the bosses. There is a big problem with crime, drug running and prostitution among the Albanian community and it has got to be faced up to.</p> <p>\"We have this terrible history of land grabbing we have to be wary of. No one mentions the terrible ethnic cleansing carried out by the Albanian Nazi quasi-state in western Macedonia during the war. It was very telling how the president of Albania was one of the first to come out against what was happening in Tetovo, and he basically said, 'We don't support this, wipe them out.' People in Albania don't want this super state nonsense. They know it is stupid.\"</p> <p>Back in Tetova, Artan Skendera is getting his breath back after the busiest month of his life. He runs the local Albanian TV station, Art TV, from which most of the pictures of the fighting have been sent. It's been good for business, but it's business he'd rather do without.</p> <p>Artan, as the name of his station suggests, is an idealist, a believer in the power of art to overcome all enmities. He is also a big fan of Manchevski the film-maker if not the proto-politician. \"If everyone in Macedonia was like Manchevski we would have less problems. Before The Rain told the truth about all the peoples of Macedonia. It was very important for all of us, it showed our lives to the world.\"</p> <p>Dust too, he hopes, might bring Slavs and Albanians closer again. \"Some things like beauty and art are above nationalism,\" he says. It is asking a lot from a piece of entertainment.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Joe Fiennes is having another bad day. While Naomi Campbell grows impatient for his company in London - and the lady is not one for waiting - he is stuck on a scorching hot Balkan mountain top, the air thick with every sort of biting and stinging insect. The brain begins to boil at about 42 degrees celsius (108 fahrenheit) - and, this morning, with forest fires raging on the horizon, the temperature is touching a barely believable 50. Joe won't be getting to London any time soon. Today, though, he gets to give his Australian co-star David Wenham a good kicking. You can hear the dull thud of boot on rib as soon as you leave the shade of the ancient Orthodox monastery of Treskovec in southern Macedonia and snake your way up through the tinder-dry alpine meadow strewn with Byzantine rubble to the baking rock of the summit. Wenham is writhing in the dust, coughing and spluttering, surrounded by a halo of wasps. Fiennes, unshaven, irritable and obviously relishing the prospect of another day stewing in his own sweat, kicks him in the stomach, grinds the heel of his cowboy boot down on Wenham's hand and drawls: \"You never were no good, Luke.\" This goes on, with a short break for lunch and an adjustment of Wenham's bandages, from 9am until after 8pm. By then, even Milcho Manchevski (the man who persuaded them to \"come to Macedonia and be in my 'eastern' - it'll be fun\") has had enough. And this was one of the good days on the set of Dust, the first \"baklava western\". Even by the tortuous standards of movie-making, this was a bizarre and horrendous shoot - Apocalypse Now without the luxury of a studio budget. The omens were not good. From day one, the crew began dropping like flies from dysentery and a medical dictionary of equally nasty complaints - even the unit doctor invalided himself out. Then it got weirder. A week before I arrived, as the worst heatwave to hit the Balkans in 30 years added sunstroke to the sick list, a flock of marauding sheep, half-demented with thirst, overran the set. These being Balkan sheep, there were casualties. A few days later, several people were badly stung by thousands of wasps drawn to the watermelons bought to keep the surviving crew from expiring. The swarm was followed by plagues of mosquitoes and horse flies. Then came dark mutterings from the Macedonians on the crew of a government plot. Wasn't it strange how, as the thermometers on set screeched towards 50 degrees celsius, each night on the state TV news the temperature never topped 42 - the level above which a national emergency would have to be declared and all work stop? It was as if the film - a Cain and Abel, id versus ego, parable of two cowboy brothers from the old American west who bring their deadly filial feud to Macedonia when they enlist as mercenaries on opposing sides during the first Balkan war of 1912 - had incurred the wrath of the Almighty. If it sounds like something only Sam Peckinpah might have attempted, you'd be right. But then old Sam always claimed to have the devil on his side. Everything, including Nato, seems to have conspired against Dust and its dramatic historical sweep from the badlands of Arizona to bandit-ravaged turn-of-the-century Bitola, where the young Ataturk fought in vain to keep the Macedonia of his birth under Ottoman control. As final preparations for filming began in the spring of 1999, war broke out in neighbouring Kosovo and frightened the money away. Manchevski's pleas to be allowed to go ahead were drowned out by the roar of American B52s passing overhead on their way to pulverise Pristina. There was one other unquantifiable factor at work here almost as fiery as the weather. For, presiding over this surreal Fitzcarraldo in a huge cartoon stetson hat was the enigmatic figure of Manchevski himself, a former punk from the Macedonian capital of Skopje, who walked off the set of his last film after only a fortnight because he claimed its Hollywood producer thought \"she had a bigger dick than me\". And yes, those immortal words \"He'll never work in this town again\" - or ones very like them - were indeed uttered by Laura \"Pretty Woman\" Ziskin after that spectacular falling out on the cannibal flick Ravenous. (Tellingly, the crew rebelled against Manchevski's replacement and Ravenous was eventually finished by the British director Antonia Bird, who maintains that its problems were not of Manchevski's making. \"He'd been stitched up big time, in my opinion.\") Even shorn of his green mohican, Manchevski cuts quite a figure. Only someone with a highly developed sense of the ridiculous could stride on to a set in a joke cowboy hat and badass shades, with a vast pashmina shawl draped around his narrow shoulders, and expect to take charge. First impressions, of course, can be very deceptive. Manchevski may have picked up the swagger, and that eccentric dress sense, directing pop videos in America for the likes of Arrested Development, but he is no cocky fool. For he knew there was a lot more than money, or even whether he would be allowed behind a camera again, riding on Dust. \"I spent five and half years sweating blood to make this film,\" he says. \"I was making a shit-load of money trying to make studio films, but I just couldn't do it. You can't make good films that mean something by remote control. You couldn't make up what happens in LA, it's beyond satire. Hollywood is full of the most miserable, unhappy people I have ever met - and I'm from the Balkans.\" That little contretemps with Ziskin, arguably the most powerful woman in Hollywood, would have probably finished his career had Manchevski not had an Oscar nomination and won the Golden Lion at Venice for Before the Rain, his lyrical debut warning of what might happen if Macedonia followed the rest of the former Yugoslavia over the abyss into war. It is hard to underestimate the effect Before the Rain had on this tiny, fragile and fragmented country of 3m, with no obvious historical or ethnic precedents other than a shared reluctance from its either Slav or Albanian-speaking peoples to throw their lot in with the madhouses of Belgrade or Tirana. Macedonia - the word means \"mixed\" - also has Serb, Vlach, Roma and Bulgar minorities, making it in present Balkan terms more a conundrum than a country. In such disputed circumstances, Manchevski has become, unwittingly and unwillingly, more national talisman than mere film-maker. His perfectionism may make him a nightmare to work with at times, but in a country where cliques and political cabals hold sway, his unimpeachable punk contrariness has won him the trust of ordinary Macedonians. Until the skirmishes on the Kosovan border near Tetovo last month, both main Macedonian communities shared a fierce common pride in being the only former Yugoslav republic in which not a single shot had been fired in anger. The dreamlike Before the Rain, and its powerful appeal for tolerance, was the fairytale all ethnic groups seemed to have taken to heart. New countries need heroes, and Manchevski, the punk who ran away to the US \"as soon as I could\", and who cites the Sex Pistols as his greatest formative influence, was accidentally cast in the role of its chief iconographer. The prodigal son was being handed the mythic glue to hold the nation together - it was as if Malcolm McLaren was being asked to reinvent the monarchy. Dust - in which shifting alliances of Albanians, Bulgarians, Serbs, Turks, Greeks and various brigand bands battle for dominance as Macedonia emerges from five centuries of Ottoman rule - will be watched through that very delicate prism when it first sees the light of day at either the Cannes or the Venice film festivals; both are currently battling for the right to show it first. It is a fair bet that a few shadowy men from the Pentagon and the UN will want an early look, too. If that responsibility weighs heavily on Manchevski, he doesn't show it. Wiry, boyish and as charming as he is intense, even among his own he's a person apart, an effect intensified by a slightly off-centre pupil in one eye. No one knows much about his childhood in Skopje and he likes to keep it that way. His mischievous bluster, though, betrays a certain nervousness. \"I am an outsider. I was never part of any political or cultural establishment, even though in these parts you have to be because social life is so tribal. It's very like Hollywood, I guess. So I haven't had to sell my ass, which makes the government here suspicious of me. All this talk of civil war is crazy and dangerous. I really don't think it can happen. Then again, I said that about Bosnia. Macedonia is not Kosovo, you just can't compare how the Albanians have been treated in both places. I'll let you into a secret. That fighting in Tetovo is all my fault. I bribed them [the Albanian guerrillas] for publicity for the film and they just got a little carried away.\" Skopje airport has that uneasy feel of a place just out of earshot of something nasty. The flight from London was full of wary Americans and country casual Brits with Sandhurst accents pretending to be something in the City. A US Chinook helicopter thundered by as soon as we landed, lugging itself over the ammunition and fuel dumps that line the runway and out across the bristling weaponry dug into the fields beyond. It was bound for Kosovo, just beyond the ridge of mountains on the horizon where a low-level war is still raging. Systematic Serb ethnic cleansing of the long-suffering majority Albanian community has given way to slow and but equally cynical creation of an ethnically pure Albanian state. Nato keeps score with impeccable fairness. You can tell how close a country is to going belly-up when everyone with a car becomes a taxi driver. And everyone in the surging throng outside the doors of Skopje airport, except the Albanian women in scarves and ankle-length coats wrestling returning sons to their chests, was a taxi driver. Macedonia has paid a horrific price for allowing itself to be used as Nato's forward base against Milosevic. The blockade of Serbia, its main market, has destroyed its industry and the exodus of 400,000 Kosovan Albanian refugees threatened to upset its already delicate 65/30 ethnic balance between Orthodox Slavs and Muslim Albanians. No wonder, to the horrified hypocrisy of the West, it eventually tried to close the border. Before the Balkan wars of the 1990s it was the second poorest Yugoslav republic after Kosovo, now its unemployment rate is over 50 per cent. The average weekly wage for those lucky enough to still be in work is \u00a325. You can't eat spectacular scenery. With the roads thick with US military convoys and Humbies full of GIs taking their R&amp;R chasing out-of-work Skopje factory girls, it is not hard to see where Manchevski drew the inspiration for Dust, where Fiennes' fire-and-brimstone Arizona preacher hunts down and does battle with his amoral beast of a brother in the middle of someone else's war. Setting the story just as the Ottoman empire collapsed almost overnight and took the most stable, multi-ethnic society in Europe with it, was no accident either. It is from the two, short, messy wars in 1912 and 1913 that the myth of the unruly, ungovernable Balkans largely stems. Manchevski drew on the detailed reports of the Carnegie Commission into the First and Second Balkan wars for much of his material, but it was the far more colourful Confessions of a Macedonian Bandit written by the San Franciscan adventurer Albert Sonnichsen a few years earlier that really fascinated him. \"I became came very conscious of the parallels of Westerners, particularly Americans, getting sucked into local quarrels and wars, almost always without fully understanding what is going on. |It was as if they were trying to work out something in themselves. It is like with some charity workers now, it's all a glorified way of going to the shrink.\" Just to reinforce the point, Sigmund Freud, the father of psychoanalysis, has memorable cameo, being sick over the side of a transatlantic liner. Sonnichsen's photographs of these outlandishly dressed bands of brigands convinced Manchevski he had to shoot the film as a Baklava Western. \"We couldn't use some of the things Sonnichsen described because they were just too fantastic. People would not believe it. The more I saw and read the more I was reminded of the most way-out Mexican Zapatista revolutionaries and bandilleros, it was like they had been shopping in the same boutique.\" The violence was another common thread. For when it came to cold calculated cruelty, the sullen cowpokes who people the novels of Cormac McCarthy and the films of Sam Peckinpah scraped the same barrel as the Balkan brigands. \"It is very hard reading the Carnegie Commission reports,\" says Manchevski, \"because you realise the violence that went on then is still happening in the Balkans. People were sliced open and their guts used to strangle them. Arms were cut off and then used to beat that person to death, people buried up to their necks and set alight with gasoline. This became the general Western perception of Balkan behaviour that was reinforced by the misconceptions created by writers like Rebecca West (author of the \"definitive\" Yugoslav travelogue Black Lamb and Grey Falcon). When you need to exorcise your own demons who assign them to someone else. This was not violence unknown to the West, or indeed in the Old American West, on the contrary the violence in the Balkans was always and still is less efficient.\" We joke that if the Germans had been involved there would only have been one Balkan war, little suspecting that last month, when the fighting broke out in the hills above Tetova, a German tank unit which stood idly by would be scathing about the local Macedonia police's half-hearted attempts to mortar the rebels out. Had they sealed the border with Kosovo , the shooting might never have started. Having visited Tetova during fighting, Manchevski, in a typically contrary flourish, said he was intensely proud of the half-arsed way the Albanian gunmen who attacked the town were dealt with. \"If the Macedonians had gone in all guns blazing Hollywood style it would have been a mess. Not one Albanian store window has been smashed during the terrorist raids on Tetovo. There has been no ethnic retaliation, nor escalation and that must be applauded.\" Although he sympathises with many of the relatively modest Albanian demands on the recognition of their language and university, he is also angry that \"no Albanian party nor intellectual has issued a clear-cut condemnation\" of the violence, which he sees as racist. \"If you treat institutions of law and order as illegitimate by default, you risk turning the place into a Milosevic-style quasi-state. It breeds distrust. When you start using violence you never know where it will end. Even if you qualify it as a fight for human rights.

Manchevski, it has to be said, is a Slav but even the Albanians in Tetova I spoke to this week, whose attitude to those gunmen in the hills is ambivalent to say the least, agree the time has now come to put away the guns and talk. Arsim Celaj, a student who claims to have been beaten by Macedonian police because he attends the town's \"illegal\" Albanian university, said there had to be \"dialogue and compromises. The government has to talk to us. All this has happened because of frustration that nothing was being done for Albanian people. There must be dialogue now not more war.\" \"I won't lie to you. It's been hell, but things are at last looking up,\" Chris Auty, the film's English co-producer assured me the night I arrived at their base in the dusty provincial town of Prilep. A few hours later Auty, a man of limitless optimism and good grace, was savaged by a mastiff on the doorstep of his hotel. He even managed a toothy smile as he limped, nauseous back onto set the next day at Treskovac after a double tetanus jab. I hadn't the heart to mention rabies. \"Could have been worse,\" he sighed.

When the world feels sorry for the Albanians, I think they should remember their grievances are not that great that they justify going to war. Macedonia is a state based on a proper co-habitation and toleration. The vice-president of parliament is an Albanian for Christ sake and six of the 17 ministers are too, plus deputy ministers of most ministries, the police, the army, a number of ambassadors. Macedonia is a very young country. It is true in the early days it had to strong line of Macedonian nationalism to set itself apart from Serbia, but that nationalism has been reined in now. There are many legitimate issues to be discussed, but what many Macedonians worry about is that when Albanians talk about human rights what they really want is secession. Albanian parties in Macedonia more often identify with ethnic Albanian causes in Kosovo or Albania than with the cause of the Macedonian state. They sit in the government, but act like foreign-state opposition. Either shit or get off the pot. These politicians have to decide if they want to be in this country or not.\" And Manchevski is a Macedonian liberal. His views on the gangsterism he sees spreading among rural Albanians, fears even some militant Albanians in Tetova privately share, are equally forthright. \"Too much has been made of this stuff about centuries' old hatreds. At least a part of the shooting is about local strongmen being able to keep their fiefdoms so there is open roads for smuggling, the drug trade and who runs the brothels and gets first go. It is that basic for a lot of these guys with the guns. If there is no structure anymore because everything is going up in smoke then they are the bosses. There is a big problem with crime, drug running and prostitution among the Albanian community and it has got to be faced up to. \"We have this terrible history of land grabbing we have to be wary of. No one mentions the terrible ethnic cleansing carried out by the Albanian Nazi quasi-state in western Macedonia during the war. It was very telling how the president of Albania was one of the first to come out against what was happening in Tetovo, and he basically said, 'We don't support this, wipe them out.' People in Albania don't want this super state nonsense. They know it is stupid.\" Back in Tetova, Artan Skendera is getting his breath back after the busiest month of his life. He runs the local Albanian TV station, Art TV, from which most of the pictures of the fighting have been sent. It's been good for business, but it's business he'd rather do without. Artan, as the name of his station suggests, is an idealist, a believer in the power of art to overcome all enmities. He is also a big fan of Manchevski the film-maker if not the proto-politician. \"If everyone in Macedonia was like Manchevski we would have less problems. Before The Rain told the truth about all the peoples of Macedonia. It was very important for all of us, it showed our lives to the world.\" Dust too, he hopes, might bring Slavs and Albanians closer again. \"Some things like beauty and art are above nationalism,\" he says. It is asking a lot from a piece of entertainment.",

Carrie Chic made one-shouldered tops (once only for 80s rawk fans) and corsages (formerly reserved for extra-dull weddings) extremely sexy. </p> <p>And how the high street noticed.

There you shall find every one-shouldered top you could ever desire - it even has a near-identical copy of a chiffon top last seen on Carrie sauntering down Fifth Avenue. Sadly, the Chanel leggings with matching blouse Carrie wore to brunch in the last series have yet to be copied, but I expect to see them in Topshop any day. </p> <p>It's rather like drowning in a sea of Fendi baguettes - too much of what once seemed like a very good thing. Even worse, this is a trend that has cost me money. Last weekend I simply lacked the strength to resist a couple of those corsages and, yes, even a one-shouldered top, only to find on my return home that I had spent more cash than was reasonable on items that, just one year ago, would have seemed downright unacceptable.

The appliqu\u00e9s adorning everyone's shoulders and toes these days remind one of \"those home personal touches\" as advocated by Home Front. </p> <p>Designer Russell Sage has designed everything from jackets to hotpants out of antique fabrics from sofas and curtains. Then there's the fashionista's favourite, the toile de jouy prints from Cacharel, which will make you look like a walking guest room but, like, in a really good way. </p> <p>Oversubcribed's favourite, though, is this really rather lovely top from Galibardy, made out of curtain fabric, available from London's Spitalfields Market. Not only is it a far more wearable and flattering take on this season's Furnishing Fashion, but at a mere \u00a335, it is much more affordable, too. See? Even fashion at its most, er, extreme need not mean extreme prices. </p> <p><strong> Overheard: \"Sexcapades\"</strong><br> </p> <p> Unnecessary salacious details of the highly uninteresting sexual past of someone very boring.

Indeed, the Guardian has learned that Lord Williams, the attorney general, has already instructed prosecution lawyers to appeal if the crown loses this crucial argument.</p> <p>If he loses, Mr Shayler is almost certain to appeal in a dispute which is likely to go all the way to the law lords.</p> <p>A delay will mean that, even if the prosecution finally wins the argument, an Old Bailey trial will not begin until the autumn at the earliest, and probably not until next spring - more than 18 months after Mr Shayler voluntarily returned from France to face charges. By that time, his lawyers would be likely to argue that a trial would be an abuse of process.</p> <p>In what has turned out to be a lengthy and tortuous cat and mouse game for the government, Mr Shayler, 33, fled to the continent after making damaging disclosures about the security services in 1997.</p> <p>A year later he was arrested in Paris pending extraditon hearings. He was released after a Paris court ruled that the government's attempt to pursue him under the secrets act was politically motivated. Last August he returned to Britain, where he was immediately arrested.</p> <p>Now the trial itself threatens yet more embarrassment. The prospect of a lengthy delay, and even abandoning the trial, would not be entirely unwelcome to ministers or MI5.</p> <p>A trial, to which the attorney general has personally consented, would raise the whole issue of government secrecy and how ministers strongly opposed the secrets act when they were in opposition. It would also renew Mr Shayler's claims that the bombings of the City of London in 1993 and the Israeli embassy in London the following year could have been prevented.</p> <p>A trial would again raise allegations made by Mr Shayler including how MI5 keeps files on Labour ministers and radical pop groups, its incompetence, and - though significantly he has not been charged with this - how MI6 was involved in a plot to assassinate the Libyan leader, Colonel Muammar Gadafy.</p> <p>The Gadafy plot allegation is the subject of a special branch report still being considered by the crown prosecution service.</p> <p>Privately, government law-yers admit that the secrets act is unworkable as it stands.</p> <p>Mr Shayler's lawyers argue that the act is in direct conflict with the Human Rights Act, which enshrines the right to freedom of speech, because it reverses the burden of proof and prevents the accused from arguing that he acted in the public interest.</p> <p>Prosecution lawyers in the case vigorously contest these arguments in a 50-page brief they have handed to Mr Justice Moses.</p> <p>Defence lawyers, meanwhile, are arguing with the prosecution about what classified papers the defence should be allowed to see - an argument which could also embrace the trial jury.</p> <p>John Wadham, director of Liberty, the civil rights group and Mr Shayler's solicitor, said last night: \"The legal arguments in this case are absolutely crucial to the trial and... to many of the issues, not restricted to David Shayler, about the way the Official Secrets Act is used in criminal trials more generally.\"</p>",

The issue at the heart of the high profile case - and the one which threatens to torpedo it - is whether the Official Secrets Act, which Mr Shayler has been charged with breaching, is incompatible with the Human Rights Act. This key, untested question - which has widespread political as well as legal implications - will be argued before Mr Justice Moses on April 24, the day the trial was due to start. Whatever the judge decides, the loser is almost bound to appeal, lawyers say. Indeed, the Guardian has learned that Lord Williams, the attorney general, has already instructed prosecution lawyers to appeal if the crown loses this crucial argument. If he loses, Mr Shayler is almost certain to appeal in a dispute which is likely to go all the way to the law lords. A delay will mean that, even if the prosecution finally wins the argument, an Old Bailey trial will not begin until the autumn at the earliest, and probably not until next spring - more than 18 months after Mr Shayler voluntarily returned from France to face charges. By that time, his lawyers would be likely to argue that a trial would be an abuse of process. In what has turned out to be a lengthy and tortuous cat and mouse game for the government, Mr Shayler, 33, fled to the continent after making damaging disclosures about the security services in 1997. A year later he was arrested in Paris pending extraditon hearings. He was released after a Paris court ruled that the government's attempt to pursue him under the secrets act was politically motivated. Last August he returned to Britain, where he was immediately arrested. Now the trial itself threatens yet more embarrassment. The prospect of a lengthy delay, and even abandoning the trial, would not be entirely unwelcome to ministers or MI5. A trial, to which the attorney general has personally consented, would raise the whole issue of government secrecy and how ministers strongly opposed the secrets act when they were in opposition. It would also renew Mr Shayler's claims that the bombings of the City of London in 1993 and the Israeli embassy in London the following year could have been prevented. A trial would again raise allegations made by Mr Shayler including how MI5 keeps files on Labour ministers and radical pop groups, its incompetence, and - though significantly he has not been charged with this - how MI6 was involved in a plot to assassinate the Libyan leader, Colonel Muammar Gadafy. The Gadafy plot allegation is the subject of a special branch report still being considered by the crown prosecution service. Privately, government law-yers admit that the secrets act is unworkable as it stands. Mr Shayler's lawyers argue that the act is in direct conflict with the Human Rights Act, which enshrines the right to freedom of speech, because it reverses the burden of proof and prevents the accused from arguing that he acted in the public interest. Prosecution lawyers in the case vigorously contest these arguments in a 50-page brief they have handed to Mr Justice Moses. Defence lawyers, meanwhile, are arguing with the prosecution about what classified papers the defence should be allowed to see - an argument which could also embrace the trial jury. John Wadham, director of Liberty, the civil rights group and Mr Shayler's solicitor, said last night: \"The legal arguments in this case are absolutely crucial to the trial and... to many of the issues, not restricted to David Shayler, about the way the Official Secrets Act is used in criminal trials more generally.\"",

That hasn't prevented the party, founded in the early 1990s, from achieving a remarkable level of success and attention. However, the party's claim to be the \"fourth party\" of UK politics, thanks to the election of three MEPs in the 1999 European election, is contested by the Green party, with its five elected members in the Scottish, European and London legislatures. Ukip members argue that from their one policy all others must flow: that rescuing of Britain's status a sovereign state is so vital that all other manifesto commitments are conditional on the point of principle. Certainly, one of the party's biggest achievements since the 1997 contest is bringing the concept of EU withdrawal from the outlandish outskirts of British political thought into the mainstream agenda - to the extent that many Tory MPs privately back the idea. And without the Referendum party to contend with at the next election, the Ukip should have a clean run at the 52% of the population its members claim favour withdrawal from the EU. A side-effect of this positioning is suspicion - strongly contested by the party itself -that the Ukip's natural constituency is disenchanted Tory Eurosceptics. The party claims a large part of its support comes from natural Labour and Liberal Democrat voters - and there are certainly muffled voices of Euroscepticism within both those parties' parliamentary troops. In fact some UKIP policies, such as guaranteeing the right to trial by jury might actually win over some libertarian members of the Labour left and Lib Dem purists, if those policies were not overshadowed by the party's strident single message, and the double-edged sword of its self-explanatory name. So what are the party's prospects at the election? The party has big ambitions - claiming it will fight up to 400 of the UK's 659 parliamentary constituencies.

Even so, one of the party's leading lights and the author of its manifesto, Dr Aidan Rankin, has written a pamphlet spelling out the reasons why the party is not confined to little Englanders and xenophobes. True or not, this could be the party's Achilles heel come June 7. One party that, uniquely among the larger minority parties, will be fielding fewer prospective parliamentary candidates this time around than in 1997 is the British National party. A minnow in British political terms, the BNP may be politically beyond the pale but puts forward policies similar to those of other parties in Europe which have won wide support. For this reason, it is worth looking at. In 1997 their 100-seat plus effort netted them a highly controversial party election broadcast, showing BNP leader John Tyndall standing on the white cliffs of Dover.

The party is targeting around 30 seats in areas such as south-east London, Dewsbury, Doncaster, Manchester and Oldham where it perceives a \"white flight\" will favour \"our sort of policies\". Despite sentiments on their website which would disgust many white voters and rightly alarm those from ethnic minorities, the party argues persistently and rather unbelievably that it is not, in fact, racist. This despite calling for the voluntary repatriation of all non-European immigrants, so that in Mr Edwards words \"we are not a mongrel race.\" Members claim that Conservative leader William Hague \"knows we're right, but he's hamstrung\", a sentiment which may do more to damage to Mr Hague than help the BNP. Out of self-interest, the party is in favour of proportional representation, since \"this would help us.\" The party also insists it is \"not into confrontational politics\", has no links with the National Front and no longer takes part in town centre marches. However, the party's self-professed aim is to win seats at local authority level rather than at Westminster - boosted by the 17% BNP candidate Michael Davidson scored in the Beckton byelection in east London, and the 80,000 votes they polled in the battle for London mayor.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>A new type of antibiotic hailed as a key weapon against antibiotic-resistant hospital \"superbugs\" may already be losing its power, scientists warned yesterday. </p> <p>Linezolid, promoted as the first in a new class of antibiotic for 35 years, was only licensed in Britain four months ago. But evidence from the United States suggests that harmful bacteria have already built up resistance to the drug, sold under the brand name Zyvox. </p> <p>Doctors in this country last night remained cautiously optimistic that the drug could still cut the 100,000 infections caught by British patients each year while in hospital. </p> <p>With 5,000 deaths a year, experts have warned gloomily of a return to \"dark ages\" of medicine if hospitals do not soon get a grip on fighting the new endemic antibiotic-resistant diseases with effective drugs and vastly improved hygiene procedures. </p> <p>The concern over Zyvox so early in its commercial life will be seen as a salutary reminder of just how versatile bacteria are, partly because of cavalier overuse of antibiotics for the past 50 years in medicine and in farming. Concern at the waning powers of what were once regarded as wonder-drugs has brought firm political action only in the last three years and many critics do not believe enough is being done to educate the public, doctors or farmers of the need to cut their routine use. </p> <p>Linezolid, approved by the US food and drug administration last April, is being used to treat patients suffering from pneumonia and other infections associated with VRE, one of the so-called superbugs. </p> <p>Pharmacia, the makers, say it works in two thirds of cases and actual bacterial resistance had been found in only a handful of those. </p> <p>A study published in the Lancet yesterday found that one in 45 patients may have a resistance to the new drug. The findings will come as a blow to scientists, who believed Linezolid could overcome the most virulent bacteria, including vancomycin-resistant organisms that cause many potentially deadly infections. </p> <p>Doctors from the University of Illinois College of Medicine in Chicago studied Linezolid's success in treating five patients suffering from the vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (VRE). </p> <p>It was initially effective in all five patients, but over a period of weeks, the tests showed that the bacteria were beginning to develop a resistance to the drug. </p> <p>In three of the cases, the Linezolid treatment eventually failed as patients grew unresponsive to the drug. Doctors here will be eagerly awaiting the results.

      "bodyText": "A new type of antibiotic hailed as a key weapon against antibiotic-resistant hospital \"superbugs\" may already be losing its power, scientists warned yesterday. Linezolid, promoted as the first in a new class of antibiotic for 35 years, was only licensed in Britain four months ago. But evidence from the United States suggests that harmful bacteria have already built up resistance to the drug, sold under the brand name Zyvox. Doctors in this country last night remained cautiously optimistic that the drug could still cut the 100,000 infections caught by British patients each year while in hospital. With 5,000 deaths a year, experts have warned gloomily of a return to \"dark ages\" of medicine if hospitals do not soon get a grip on fighting the new endemic antibiotic-resistant diseases with effective drugs and vastly improved hygiene procedures. The concern over Zyvox so early in its commercial life will be seen as a salutary reminder of just how versatile bacteria are, partly because of cavalier overuse of antibiotics for the past 50 years in medicine and in farming. Concern at the waning powers of what were once regarded as wonder-drugs has brought firm political action only in the last three years and many critics do not believe enough is being done to educate the public, doctors or farmers of the need to cut their routine use. Linezolid, approved by the US food and drug administration last April, is being used to treat patients suffering from pneumonia and other infections associated with VRE, one of the so-called superbugs. Pharmacia, the makers, say it works in two thirds of cases and actual bacterial resistance had been found in only a handful of those. A study published in the Lancet yesterday found that one in 45 patients may have a resistance to the new drug. The findings will come as a blow to scientists, who believed Linezolid could overcome the most virulent bacteria, including vancomycin-resistant organisms that cause many potentially deadly infections. Doctors from the University of Illinois College of Medicine in Chicago studied Linezolid's success in treating five patients suffering from the vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (VRE). It was initially effective in all five patients, but over a period of weeks, the tests showed that the bacteria were beginning to develop a resistance to the drug. In three of the cases, the Linezolid treatment eventually failed as patients grew unresponsive to the drug. Doctors here will be eagerly awaiting the results. The public health laboratory service specialist Alan Johnston said: \"We had hoped there would be quite a long period before we saw clincial problems with the occurrence of resistance [in Zyvox]. In the last 10 to 15 years we have had a number of new drugs coming into use about which we have been optimistic that resistance might not be a problem or delayed. All too often resistance has emerged remarkably rapidly.\" But there were signs that the organisms behind a more dangerous superbug, methilin resistant staphylococcus aureus - MRSA - might find it more difficult to adapt and resist Zyvox. \"I am still cautiously optimistic we are looking at a major development in anti-microbial treatment.\" The Department of Health said last night it had been urging prudence in the use of all antibiotics to preserve their usefulness as long as possible. Cameron Durrant, vice-president for infectious diseases at Pharmacia, said the Chicago patients were \"very sick\" and the results confirmed the company's own laboratory and clinical studies. \"We have now had in excess of 60,000 patients treated with Zyvox and we are talking about a small number of cases , limited to a very small group. There has been no confirmed case of resistance to MRSA. \"We are still extremely confident that the appropriate use of Zyvox will benefit patients all over the world.\"",

      "body": "<p>Lord Harris of Greenwich, who has died aged 71, was an influential Westminster insider - serving in both the Labour and Liberal Democrats - for more than 40 years. He was probably the first ever spin doctor, but much else besides. In the early part of his career, he was personal assistant and press adviser to Hugh Gaitskell, the Labour leader, shortly before the 1959 general election; and, at the time of his death, he was Liberal Democrat chief whip in the House of Lords. In the intervening years, he played an important part in the 1975 referendum on the Common Market, served as a middle-rank minister in the second Wilson government and as chairman of the parole board. He was a close associate of Roy Jenkins in many endeavours.</p> <p>John Harris was born in Pinner, Middlesex. After leaving school, he worked on newspapers in Bournemouth and Leicester and completed national service. Then, when the Scottish Labour weekly paper Forward was brought to London to rival the leftwing Tribune in the battle between Gaitskellites and Bevanites for the soul of the Labour party, he became deputy to the new editor, Francis Williams. This proved to be his launching pad into the heart of politics. His integrity, shrewd political judgment and understanding of the press were soon recognised. For Tony Benn, Harris's appointment as assistant to Gaitskell was \"the best thing that has happened to Hugh for years\".</p> <p>From then on, Harris was present at many significant occasions, including the meeting at 18 Frognal Gardens, Gaitskell's home, in the aftermath of Labour's 1959 defeat, that led to the attempt to change clause four of the Labour party constitution. It was a grieving Harris who announced Gaitskell's death in January 1963; and in the debate over Gaitskell's successor, his doubts about the steadiness of George Brown, given Brown's drinking habits, persuaded some waverers among Gaitskell's old friends to vote for Callaghan, or even Harold Wilson, as the safer option.</p> <p>As a councillor in the new town of Harlow and leader of the Labour Group (1961-63), Harris had everyday experience of grass roots politics. He also spent two years as director of publicity for the Labour party (1962-64). But after short stints working for Patrick Gordon Walker and (less comfortably) Michael Stewart when they became cabinet ministers in 1964, he joined Roy Jenkins, the newly appointed home secretary, as a special adviser. This proved a fruitful and enduring friendship, much valued by both.</p> <p>Despite the often bumpy relations between Jenkins and Wilson in the late 1960s, Harris achieved a good working partnership with Marcia Williams, head of the political office at No 10. She was, he believed, contrary to conventional wisdom, the best of Wilson's kitchen cabinet and she, in turn, warmed to him. It was nevertheless a surprise when, on becoming prime minister again in 1974, Wilson sent Harris, by then on the staff of the Economist, to the House of Lords and made him minister of state at the Home Office.</p> <p>Here he was a success, both as a spokesman for the government and in the conduct of departmental business, where he played a key role in the setting up of the Police Complaints Authority. His interest in Home Office matters was to persist and he maintained personal contact with his former civil servants for the rest of his life.</p> <p>In 1975 Harris became a leading member of the \"Yes\" campaign in the referendum on whether Britain should remain a member of the European Economic Community. He had been closely involved in behind-the-scenes preparations and had won the confidence of senior cross-party leaders.</p> <p>Now, as joint chairman of the publicity committee, he helped to devise a highly professional presentation of the case for staying in. His closeness to Jenkins also gave him important influence on the wider political direction of what became a winning campaign. He deserved much credit for the outcome</p> <p>Harris was not prominent in the launch of the Social Democrats' party in 1981 - he was still chairman of the parole board (1979-82) - but he was a founder member. He was also a firm believer in a merger with the Liberals after the 1987 election. From 1994 he was a very effective chief whip in the House of Lords, summoning Liberal Democrat peers to divisions only when it was really necessary, but then rigorously demanding their attendance. He could sound fierce and uncompromising, but he was warm-hearted and bore no grudges, and he was respected across all benches.</p> <p>His commitment to his duties never flagged as he fought the debilitating effects of cancer. He would telephone daily from his hospital bed when a private member's bill for withdrawal from the EU threatened to be carried, then returned to the House to resume his duties, although gravely ill. On Europe and other issues, he gave New Labour the benefit of the doubt, while determined to vote against the government when ministers aban doned principle or were unwilling to compromise.</p> <p>Harris was, in his own way, a distinguished public servant, rejecting what would have been lucrative opportunities in the world of public relations, and not revealing in memoirs the confidences he received during his long career. He was always loyal to his many friends, who valued his opinions and enjoyed his company, although at heart he was a shy, rather than a gregarious, man.</p> <p>He married twice. He leaves Angela, his wife for the last 18 years, a son and daughter from his previous marriage, and grandchildren to whom he was devoted - \"my only hobby\" as he put it.</p> <p>\u0095 John Henry Harris (Lord Harris of Greenwich), politician, born April 5 1930; died April 11 2001</p>",

It was a grieving Harris who announced Gaitskell's death in January 1963; and in the debate over Gaitskell's successor, his doubts about the steadiness of George Brown, given Brown's drinking habits, persuaded some waverers among Gaitskell's old friends to vote for Callaghan, or even Harold Wilson, as the safer option. As a councillor in the new town of Harlow and leader of the Labour Group (1961-63), Harris had everyday experience of grass roots politics. He also spent two years as director of publicity for the Labour party (1962-64). But after short stints working for Patrick Gordon Walker and (less comfortably) Michael Stewart when they became cabinet ministers in 1964, he joined Roy Jenkins, the newly appointed home secretary, as a special adviser. This proved a fruitful and enduring friendship, much valued by both. Despite the often bumpy relations between Jenkins and Wilson in the late 1960s, Harris achieved a good working partnership with Marcia Williams, head of the political office at No 10. She was, he believed, contrary to conventional wisdom, the best of Wilson's kitchen cabinet and she, in turn, warmed to him. It was nevertheless a surprise when, on becoming prime minister again in 1974, Wilson sent Harris, by then on the staff of the Economist, to the House of Lords and made him minister of state at the Home Office. Here he was a success, both as a spokesman for the government and in the conduct of departmental business, where he played a key role in the setting up of the Police Complaints Authority. His interest in Home Office matters was to persist and he maintained personal contact with his former civil servants for the rest of his life. In 1975 Harris became a leading member of the \"Yes\" campaign in the referendum on whether Britain should remain a member of the European Economic Community. He had been closely involved in behind-the-scenes preparations and had won the confidence of senior cross-party leaders. Now, as joint chairman of the publicity committee, he helped to devise a highly professional presentation of the case for staying in. His closeness to Jenkins also gave him important influence on the wider political direction of what became a winning campaign. He deserved much credit for the outcome Harris was not prominent in the launch of the Social Democrats' party in 1981 - he was still chairman of the parole board (1979-82) - but he was a founder member. He was also a firm believer in a merger with the Liberals after the 1987 election. From 1994 he was a very effective chief whip in the House of Lords, summoning Liberal Democrat peers to divisions only when it was really necessary, but then rigorously demanding their attendance. He could sound fierce and uncompromising, but he was warm-hearted and bore no grudges, and he was respected across all benches. His commitment to his duties never flagged as he fought the debilitating effects of cancer. He would telephone daily from his hospital bed when a private member's bill for withdrawal from the EU threatened to be carried, then returned to the House to resume his duties, although gravely ill. On Europe and other issues, he gave New Labour the benefit of the doubt, while determined to vote against the government when ministers aban doned principle or were unwilling to compromise. Harris was, in his own way, a distinguished public servant, rejecting what would have been lucrative opportunities in the world of public relations, and not revealing in memoirs the confidences he received during his long career. He was always loyal to his many friends, who valued his opinions and enjoyed his company, although at heart he was a shy, rather than a gregarious, man. He married twice. He leaves Angela, his wife for the last 18 years, a son and daughter from his previous marriage, and grandchildren to whom he was devoted - \"my only hobby\" as he put it. \u0095 John Henry Harris (Lord Harris of Greenwich), politician, born April 5 1930; died April 11 2001",

      "bodyText": "Dissident Irish republicans vowed last night to step up their terrorist campaign, fuelling fears that hardliners will use the impasse in the peace process to launch a wave of attacks in Northern Ireland and England. As army explosives experts prepared to defuse a bomb in Co Tyrone, the Real IRA insisted that it would make no apology for \"undertaking the necessary task\" of waging a violent campaign. In a statement to mark the 85th anniversary of the republican Easter Rising in Dublin in 1916, the terrorist leadership declared: \"Partition has failed and those who attempt to uphold it will fail. As for republicans, we will continue to attack the problem at its root and make no apology for undertaking this necessary task. We will continue our struggle until the 32 county socialist republic has been achieved.\" The statement, which contrasted with a Provisional IRA statement on Wednesday night reaffirming support for the peace process, came as little surprise to leaders across the political spectrum who fear that the failure to resolve the deadlock over arms will strengthen the position of dissidents opposed to the peace process. The threat posed by the dissidents was underlined yesterday when security forces were called out to deal with a so called \"barrack buster\" bomb at Altmore Forest, Galbally, Co Tyrone. The bomb was discovered 10 miles from the scene of the Real IRA attack at Omagh in 1998 - the largest single atrocity of the Troubles, which killed 29 people and two unborn babies. Bomb disposal experts began examining a van containing the bomb yesterday in a painstaking operation which may take several days to complete. There were fears last night that dissidents were planning to mount a \"spectacular\" attack to mark the anniversary of the Easter Rising in which 15 republicans were executed in Dublin by British forces. Since the Omagh bombing the dissidents have launched several bomb attacks on security bases in Northern Ireland and on high profile targets in London, including the MI6 headquarters and BBC television centre. The security forces have managed to thwart many more attacks through surveillance. Security sources say their success in targeting the dissidents demonstrates the importance of keeping army watch towers in border areas of south Armagh. Sinn Fein insists that dismantling the towers would be a boost for the peace process and would diminish support for the dissidents. The watch towers will take centre stage when the British and Irish governments resume negotiations after the election to overcome the deadlock in the peace process. Under a three point plan, the British army would dismantle the watch towers in return for a significant gesture by the Provisional IRA over weapons. In the new climate, nationalists and republicans would sign up to the new police force. Sinn Fein warned this week that there was little chance of an agreement after the election because republicans should not be expected to make concessions in the light of David Trimble's \"illegal\" ban on Sinn Fein attending a special cross border ministerial council. Mitchel McLaughlin, Sinn Fein chairman, called instead for a renegotiation of the Good Friday agreement to save the peace process from a challenge by hardline unionists after the general election. Adam Ingram, the Northern Ireland minister, said he hoped that Sinn Fein was not abandoning its support for the agreement, adding that republicans should concentrate on resolving the impasse over IRA arms. Mr Ingram told the Today programme: \"I would hope that [Mr McLaughlin's remarks] do not mean that Sinn Fein is moving away from the Good Friday agreement... If Sinn Fein is genuinely seeking a new future for Northern Ireland it has got to address all the issues and that includes decommissioning.\"",

But, as the nation begins its Easter bank holiday break today, it is a claim the British public appears to be ignoring.</p> <p>A record number of holidaymakers are eschewing the burning pyres and banned footpaths for the guaranteed warmth and rural freedom abroad.</p> <p>A total of 1.5m people - 15% more than last Easter - are due to take last-minute breaks to the Canary islands, mainland Spain, Ibiza, Tunisia, Cyprus, Florida and the Caribbean, with more than 1m scheduled to depart from UK airports over the holiday period and at least 500,000 crossing the channel.</p> <p>British tourist boards have reported a 30% drop in bookings with those areas affected by foot and mouth - such as Cumbria and parts of Devon - taking just 20% of their usual bookings for Easter.</p> <p>Despite 37% of footpaths, and 85% of tourist attractions in Devon being open, the south-west - which has lost \u00a325m since the start of April - fears it will lose another \u00a316m over the Easter weekend alone, a crucial period which accounts for 60% of all its business in April.</p> <p>\"Bookings are holding up in the coastal regions, but on Exmoor and Dartmoor [both of which are closed to the public] we're looking at a loss of 80%,\" said Malcolm Bell, the chief executive of South West Tourism.</p> <p>In Cumbria - which has been losing \u00a310m a week through the crisis, with business down by two thirds - the situation appears to be even more critical.</p> <p>With a complete ban on fell walking, and only a quarter of footpaths open, local pubs, hotels and bed and breakfasts have been shattered by the loss in passing trade. \"We know of one hotel which had losses of 97% in March,\" said Allan King, of the Cumbria tourist board. \"It's fully booked this weekend - but that's been partly achieved because the landlord's asked guests to offer him just what they think the weekend's worth.\"</p> <p>Tony Blair and his deputy, John Prescott, yesterday embarked on separate tours to woo visitors back to tourist destinations.</p> <p>Mr Blair, on a walkabout in Torquay in Devon, said: \"Even in the heart of the countryside, provided people do not go through the livestock parts, they can do the things they always do and enjoy the countryside in the way they should.\"</p> <p>Mr Prescott, taking a canal boat trip in Hertfordshire to endorse the reopening nationwide of 1,000 miles of towpaths and the inland waterway network, said: \"I'm encouraging people to go out and look at the walks they could do.

      "body": "<p>\"Thank God it's Good Friday!\" exclaimed a DJ yesterday. Forgive him, he probably knew not what he said. A recent Mori poll found that 43% of the population do not know what Easter celebrates. A large number of the young haven't a clue, beyond hot cross buns, bonnets, chocolate eggs, lambs and daffodils. Maybe death and redemption do lack a certain zingy selling power. But this kind of ignorance and loss of heritage sets off a crisis of culture panic.</p> <p>How can people look at a painting or sculpture or read a book of previous centuries or understand anything about history if they don't know this most essential Christian story - let alone the difference between a Catholic and a Protestant? Without a basic knowledge of Christianity the past is a closed book. Mythology, iconography, the common roots of stories and ideas are all missing. Resurrection may be a solstice theme stolen from a pagan rite of spring, but how can anyone appreciate the depth of passion and the overwhelming humanity in the face of Piero della Francesca's redeemer rising from the tomb, without understanding his story? A surprising poll in the Tablet yesterday shows that only half the practising members of the Church of England genuinely believe the resurrection happened. But it does not require belief to appreciate the myth's iconic power. Freud used the Greek myths, Shakespeare drew on any number of classical and historic sources, the truth of which are unimportant. Basic Bible stories are one of the foundations of western culture, without which much of it is incomprehensible.</p> <p>Without an elementary grasp of religion, much of the news becomes meaningless. It is impossible to expound the politics of the Middle East or India and Pakistan without some notion of Judaism, Islam and Hinduism. No sense can be made of the conflicts we are helping police in the Balkans without knowing something about the differences between the religions that act as artificial ethnic identifiers.

      "bodyText": "\"Thank God it's Good Friday!\" exclaimed a DJ yesterday. Forgive him, he probably knew not what he said. A recent Mori poll found that 43% of the population do not know what Easter celebrates. A large number of the young haven't a clue, beyond hot cross buns, bonnets, chocolate eggs, lambs and daffodils. Maybe death and redemption do lack a certain zingy selling power. But this kind of ignorance and loss of heritage sets off a crisis of culture panic. How can people look at a painting or sculpture or read a book of previous centuries or understand anything about history if they don't know this most essential Christian story - let alone the difference between a Catholic and a Protestant? Without a basic knowledge of Christianity the past is a closed book. Mythology, iconography, the common roots of stories and ideas are all missing. Resurrection may be a solstice theme stolen from a pagan rite of spring, but how can anyone appreciate the depth of passion and the overwhelming humanity in the face of Piero della Francesca's redeemer rising from the tomb, without understanding his story? A surprising poll in the Tablet yesterday shows that only half the practising members of the Church of England genuinely believe the resurrection happened. But it does not require belief to appreciate the myth's iconic power. Freud used the Greek myths, Shakespeare drew on any number of classical and historic sources, the truth of which are unimportant. Basic Bible stories are one of the foundations of western culture, without which much of it is incomprehensible. Without an elementary grasp of religion, much of the news becomes meaningless. It is impossible to expound the politics of the Middle East or India and Pakistan without some notion of Judaism, Islam and Hinduism. No sense can be made of the conflicts we are helping police in the Balkans without knowing something about the differences between the religions that act as artificial ethnic identifiers. Nightly the news brings pictures of yet more bloodshed from the accursed city of Jerusalem, that ill-fated breeding place of three of the world religions that have caused such calamity. The tribal slaughter makes no sense to anyone without a smattering of religious knowledge. The good atheist/agnostic may be gratified at the departure of organised religion from most of British national life, but there should be no pleasure in wholesale ignorance of their history.

      "body": "<p>As the train rushed through the Chinese countryside, he leapt to his feet in the swaying compartment to declaim with astonishing recall and great passion Martin Luther King's speech beginning \"I have a dream...\" The young man, encountered by chance on a journey across southern China a few years ago, was a graduate of the Shanghai Foreign Languages Academy, a protesting student in that city at the time of Tiananmen and, as one of the country's new entrepreneurs, already on the way to making a fortune out of cellular phones.</p> <p>Arrested and briefly detained, he had become a businessman rather than the official he would almost certainly have been only a few years earlier. But the cellphone proselytiser had in no way reneged on the democratic hopes that had sent him out onto the Shanghai streets in 1989.</p> <p>That moment on the train allowed one to see how much Chinese ideas of personal freedom are bound up with their understanding of America and its possibilities. And their understanding, also, of how far America has fallen short of those possibilities. The reformer Kang Youwei, born in 1858, reflected that even though slavery had been the issue over which America fought their civil war, \"To this day the American people do not admit the equality of black people,\" as they still did not when King spoke.</p> <p>These intertwined ideas of America - an inspiring vision of freedom, but an imperfect and sometimes contradictory reality - have always run in educated Chinese minds as a counterpoint to the more visible political and diplomatic manoeuvres of the two countries over many years. After all, the appearance in Tiananmen Square of a papier mach\u00e9 model of the Statue of Liberty was one of the events that infuriated the elderly leaders trying to control the situation from the government complex of Zhongnanhai.</p> <p>And, after all, the men behind the recent release of the Tiananmen Papers, which show how those leaders debated, dithered and finally did the worst possible thing, chose American scholars as their helpers in a dramatic effort to reopen the debate on democracy in China. The issue which Zhao Ziyang, the loser in 1989, raised when, according to the Tiananmen Papers, he told the other leaders \"If the party doesn't hold up the banner of democracy in our country someone else will, and we will lose out\" has still not been settled.</p> <p>This is the broader moral and cultural background to the clash between American superpower and Chinese regional power seen in episodes like that of the American spy plane. The two touch one another at certain interesting points. The American instinct is to see a crisis of this kind in terms of the plight of individuals - the captured American crew and their families and, in this case, the missing Chinese interceptor pilot and his family. President Bush's direct expressions of sympathy to the wife of Wang Wei, the lost pilot, may well have infuriated the Chinese government. They seem to have responded by having her write to the White House asking for a state apology.</p> <p>\"In the eyes of the Chinese leaders\" according to one experienced Chinese observer, \"apologies in a situation like this are not due to individuals but to the state. For the American president to go over their heads to address a Chinese citizen was quite out of order.\" Out of order, that is, because it emphasises that individuals have rights, rights which sometimes must outweigh governmental considerations.</p> <p>It is the same point the US made this week when it tabled a resolution critical of China at the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva. Yet, even if the Chinese government remains wedded officially to the state to state view, they too must defer to the modern preoccupation with individual fate, and did so with many hours of programming on the search for Wang Wei. This resembled less the old socialist hero model of coverage than the American model of reality TV, noted John Pomfret of The Washington Post.</p> <p>The rights of individuals, the principle on which Chinese and western governments, although not necessarily the Chinese and western peoples, differ most sharply, have come to shadow almost all the critical issues. The future of Taiwan, the most critical question before the two countries, remains a strategic question but has also become, in effect, a question of human rights.</p> <p>Since the 1972 Shanghai communique, in which the US acknowledged the one China policy, the moral basis for resisting China's claim on Taiwan ceased to be that nationalist China was the legitimate government of the whole country and certainly ought to prevail in the small portion it still controlled. It has been, instead, simply that a majority of individuals on that island do not wish to be ruled by Beijing. As Taiwan has become more democratic, the argument from rights has become more and more convincing, at least to the west and perhaps, at an underground level, in China as well.</p> <p>The complexities of the relationship between China and America have deepened since Bush came to power. In both countries there are men in positions of responsibility and influence who would be comfortable with a more adversarial situation, although not one so hostile as to undermine an economic intimacy of great value, for different reasons, to both sides, or to drive China back into isolation from the world.</p> <p>Nevertheless, a rightwing American government, acting in part in defence of human rights, may in the process be strengthening the conservative elements in the Chinese party, government, and military which are least likely to advance those rights in China. That same American government, while professing a desire that China be brought fully into various world bodies, may in fact end up limiting that engagement. Because the Bush team made it so clear, during the election campaign and in the first weeks of power, that they intended to be tougher with China they may already have narrowed the options for the more liberal figures in the Chinese ruling class. That said, it was clear before Bush's victory that both the American and Chinese military establishments were shaping policies that made a degree of confrontation more likely. Hainan has only been a rather earlier confirmation of this than expected.</p> <p>Now comes the decision on Taiwan arms. It is more likely after Hainan that the Bush administration will decide to supply the weapons that Taiwan wants. No matter that the weapons will not be deployed for six or more years, and no matter that Taiwan's somewhat rundown armed forces may not be able to use them all that effectively. Taiwan understandably wants a signal of American resolve, and it could well get it. Unhappily, what may buttress confidence and democracy in Taiwan could well restrict the prospects for political reform and change in the Peoples Republic, leaving unsettled for even longer the issue that Zhao Ziyang raised so sharply in 1989.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:martin.woollacott@theguardian.com\">martin.woollacott@theguardian.com</a></p> <p><b>Related stories</b><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/china/story/0,7369,472456,00.html\">12.04.2001: Plane crew back on US soil</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/china/story/0,7369,472176,00.html\">12.04.2001: Air crew fly back to 'very sorry' US</a><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/china/story/0,7369,472093,00.html\">12.04.2001: Long-term goals sway Chinese</a><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/china/story/0,7369,472102,00.html\">12.04.2001: No crowing when Bush breaks news</a><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/china/story/0,7369,472027,00.html\">12.04.2001, comment: The hostile panda</a><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/china/story/0,7369,472088,00.html\">12.04.2001, leader: Right result for the US</a></p> <p><b>Audio</b><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/politics/0412kettle.ra\">Spy crew homecoming 'a major media event'</a><br>Americans love nothing more than returning military personnel, reports Martin Kettle in Washington DC.

The 21 men and three women at the centre of the 11-day standoff with China, left the aircraft in military fatigues, to be greeted by crowds of service families waving the Stars and Stripes and a band playing God Bless America. \"Aloha and good morning,\" Admiral Thomas Fargo, commander in chief of the US Pacific Fleet, told them in a short welcoming ceremony. It was watched by President George Bush on television over lunch at the White House. \"We're definitely glad to be back,\" the navy spy plane commander and pilot Lieutenant Shane Osborn replied. He said the crew were \"all healthy and ready to get home\". On Saturday the crew are due to be flown back to the US mainland, where they will be reunited with their families at Whidbey island naval air base in Washington state. As American television networks began what is expected to be several days of patriotic wallowing over the returning crew, there were hints in Washington that the administration is quietly preparing a tougher line towards Beijing now that the crew have been released. The administration was already due to decide within a few days whether to sell a big package of arms to Taiwan. Whatever the decision on the arms sale, Washington is now expected to offer a separate calculated insult to China by giving the Taiwanese president, Chen Shui-bian, a transit visa to visit the US en route to several Latin American countries next month.

      "body": "<p>The barricades are up, the cattle grids have been removed. The two lanes that lead into the farm are blocked by minibuses and cars. People watch the chained gates. If and when the slaughterers come to Oaklands Park farm near Newnham in Gloucestershire, they will meet peaceful and legal resistance. </p> <p>Oaklands has been issued a category A notice by the Ministry of Agriculture which means that its sheep and cows must automatically be killed. As the outbreaks in Gloucestershire have spiralled in the past few days, Maff officials and vets have confirmed on separate visits that the farm is not infected, but no appeal is allowed and in theory all the animals must be shot because they are close to a confirmed outbreak. </p> <p>But Oaklands is more than a farm. As well as having 60 cows, 100 Wensleydale sheep, a giant vegetable garden, an orchard and woods on 150 acres of lush organic pastures overlooking the river Severn, it is also a thriving, largely self-sufficient Camphill community based on the work of education pioneer Rudolf Steiner. There are 115 people on the small estate, including 50 adults with special needs and 25 children. </p> <p>Oaklands is partly funded by government and local authorities and has been widely praised for its care in the community and educational programmes and the way it links handicapped people to the environment. The animals are at the centre of the community, and if they go, say the Oaklands leaders, then the effect could be devastating. </p> <p>The farm is one of the most sustainable in Britain. Run on \"biodynamic\" lines, it is largely worked by those with special needs who range in age from 21 to 70. </p> <p>Pat Thompson, who works at Oaklands, said: \"They may not understand intellectually what is going on, but they are aware that something is wrong. They have seen the fires. All are aware on different levels\". </p> <p>An observer said: \"These are happy, confident, willing people who have great dignity, take the initiative and work together. They watch things grow, they nurture the plants and animals. If the slaughterers come, there will be a huge hole and their life will be torn to shreds. </p> <p>They are some of the most willing labourers in Britain, up at dawn to milk, herd, muck out the animals and work the gardens. The animals have been bred over 30 years for their docility. Each has a name and they reel them off: \"That's Red Elsie, that's Long legs, that's Poppy... \" said Michael. They will be almost impossible to replace. </p> <p>The community is mixed, with volunteers, artists, a priest, therapists, weavers and craftspeople. Many others come to help. \"We work with people who have lost their way\", said John Neligan, Oaklands' director. \"Agriculture brings them back into touch with themselves.\" </p> <p>The community argues strongly for vaccination, and is working with solicitors and local vets who want to help.

      "bodyText": "The barricades are up, the cattle grids have been removed. The two lanes that lead into the farm are blocked by minibuses and cars. People watch the chained gates. If and when the slaughterers come to Oaklands Park farm near Newnham in Gloucestershire, they will meet peaceful and legal resistance. Oaklands has been issued a category A notice by the Ministry of Agriculture which means that its sheep and cows must automatically be killed. As the outbreaks in Gloucestershire have spiralled in the past few days, Maff officials and vets have confirmed on separate visits that the farm is not infected, but no appeal is allowed and in theory all the animals must be shot because they are close to a confirmed outbreak. But Oaklands is more than a farm. As well as having 60 cows, 100 Wensleydale sheep, a giant vegetable garden, an orchard and woods on 150 acres of lush organic pastures overlooking the river Severn, it is also a thriving, largely self-sufficient Camphill community based on the work of education pioneer Rudolf Steiner. There are 115 people on the small estate, including 50 adults with special needs and 25 children. Oaklands is partly funded by government and local authorities and has been widely praised for its care in the community and educational programmes and the way it links handicapped people to the environment. The animals are at the centre of the community, and if they go, say the Oaklands leaders, then the effect could be devastating. The farm is one of the most sustainable in Britain. Run on \"biodynamic\" lines, it is largely worked by those with special needs who range in age from 21 to 70. Pat Thompson, who works at Oaklands, said: \"They may not understand intellectually what is going on, but they are aware that something is wrong. They have seen the fires. All are aware on different levels\". An observer said: \"These are happy, confident, willing people who have great dignity, take the initiative and work together. They watch things grow, they nurture the plants and animals. If the slaughterers come, there will be a huge hole and their life will be torn to shreds. They are some of the most willing labourers in Britain, up at dawn to milk, herd, muck out the animals and work the gardens. The animals have been bred over 30 years for their docility. Each has a name and they reel them off: \"That's Red Elsie, that's Long legs, that's Poppy... \" said Michael. They will be almost impossible to replace. The community is mixed, with volunteers, artists, a priest, therapists, weavers and craftspeople. Many others come to help. \"We work with people who have lost their way\", said John Neligan, Oaklands' director. \"Agriculture brings them back into touch with themselves.\" The community argues strongly for vaccination, and is working with solicitors and local vets who want to help. But they do not say Oaklands should be a special case. If the disease is found, then they will accept that the animals must go. Before that they will resist peacefully as well as seeking epidemiological evidence and an appeal to the courts. \"There will be a future if the animals go, but we are doing everything we can to stop the slaughter,\" said Mr Neligan.

      "body": "<p>A three month mass burn to destroy 15,000 carcasses a week was announced by the Ministry of Agriculture and the army to an astonished and then angry audience of residents and local officials at Holsworthy, Devon, yesterday. </p> <p>The reaction of David Pinney, the environment health officer for Torridge district council, who was not consulted about the plan, was that Holsworthy would have to be evacuated if the smoke blew towards the town and its hospital less than a mile away. He was in talks with the ministry last night. </p> <p>Roads to the site on Arscott Farm were being built yesterday before the announcement was made and the army hopes to start the first burn over the Easter weekend. </p> <p>David Smith, the town's postmaster and a Holsworthy councillor, said: \"It is an incredible plan, no one was consulted, everyone is against it. They described this as a permanent burning site. They propose to have 10 rows of burning animals, 15,000 a week, until they have disposed of them all.\" </p> <p>Mr Smith said that Mr Pinney arrived at the meeting unaware of the plan. </p> <p>He told a meeting of 40 traders and councillors and officials he was dismayed at the potential effects on the town which, although it has a population of only 2,000, is the main market and business centre for the sparsely populated area on the edge of Dartmoor. </p> <p>The large continuous fire to dispose of more than 150,000 carcasses has been planned in secret for two weeks after a series of plans for burial sites in the Devon area were abandoned for environmental reasons. Most objections were fears of poisoning the water supplies. </p> <p>Mr Smith said: \"We know they have a problem because there are many unburied animals lying about here, but this scheme is just crazy so close to the town. They left it until late on Thursday to tell us so it is difficult to mobilise resistance, but we cannot let this happen.\" </p> <p>On Wednesday, the junior agriculture minister, Lady Hayman, admitted the ministry still had not solved the problem. When the government last published the figures there were 30,000 carcasses unburied in Devon and since then many more animals have been slaughtered. </p> <p>Yesterday, the government continued to be secretive and would not disclose the total number of animals earmarked for slaughter so far, those slaughtered and those left unburied. </p> <p>Daily totals were issued until last week but when it became clear that the ministry was falling further and further behind with its programme and the disposal of carcasses the figures were withdrawn because they were \"inaccurate\". The figures also showed that the fact Tony Blair took charge of the crisis to improve slaughter times did not appear to have made any difference. </p> <p>Nick Brown, the agriculture minister who was concerned that the public was being kept in the dark about the progress of the disease, requested the Cabinet Office to release the figures yesterday. </p> <p>A spokeswoman for the Cabinet Office said that efforts were being made to update the figures so they were accurate. </p> <p>Last night the ministry website giving maps of restricted zones, details of outbreaks, and advice to farmers on what to do to combat getting the disease, and how to apply for licences was taken down. </p> <p>The only information available was that there had been 21 new cases up to 6.40pm yesterday bringing the total to 1,257. The last figure supplied a week ago was that nearly 400,000 carcasses remained to be destroyed and the numbers were still rising.</p> <p><strong>Email update</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/email\">Sign up for our free daily foot and mouth round-up</a></p> <p><strong>More on the election and foot and mouth</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/footandmouth\">Politics: foot and mouth</a></p> <p><strong>What's going on?</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/list\">Full list: outbreaks </a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,464555,00.html\">Graph: rise in cases</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,460510,00.html\">Full list: closed &amp; cancelled</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446486,00.html\">Causes and effects</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/theissues/article/0,6512,441031,00.html\">The issue explained</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,471911,00.html\">11.04.2001: Foot and mouth in Europe</a></p> <p><strong>The front line: meet those affected by the crisis</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,467836,00.html\">03.04.2001: Straws in the wind</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446966,00.html\">06.03.2001: Meet our panel</a><br> </p> <p><strong>Related articles</strong><br><a href=\"\u0094http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,472375,00.html\u0094\">12.04.2001: Maff halts release of foot and mouth figures</a><br><a href=\"\u0094http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,472342,00.html\u0094\">12.04.2001: Take Easter break in countryside, urges PM</a><br><a href=\"\u0094http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,472066,00.html\u0094\">12.04.2001: Epidemic 'past its peak' but some areas defy trend</a><br><a href=\"\u0094http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,472057,00.html\u0094\">12.04.2001: \u0091We aren't moving.

He was in talks with the ministry last night. Roads to the site on Arscott Farm were being built yesterday before the announcement was made and the army hopes to start the first burn over the Easter weekend. David Smith, the town's postmaster and a Holsworthy councillor, said: \"It is an incredible plan, no one was consulted, everyone is against it. They described this as a permanent burning site. They propose to have 10 rows of burning animals, 15,000 a week, until they have disposed of them all.\" Mr Smith said that Mr Pinney arrived at the meeting unaware of the plan. He told a meeting of 40 traders and councillors and officials he was dismayed at the potential effects on the town which, although it has a population of only 2,000, is the main market and business centre for the sparsely populated area on the edge of Dartmoor. The large continuous fire to dispose of more than 150,000 carcasses has been planned in secret for two weeks after a series of plans for burial sites in the Devon area were abandoned for environmental reasons. Most objections were fears of poisoning the water supplies. Mr Smith said: \"We know they have a problem because there are many unburied animals lying about here, but this scheme is just crazy so close to the town. They left it until late on Thursday to tell us so it is difficult to mobilise resistance, but we cannot let this happen.\" On Wednesday, the junior agriculture minister, Lady Hayman, admitted the ministry still had not solved the problem. When the government last published the figures there were 30,000 carcasses unburied in Devon and since then many more animals have been slaughtered. Yesterday, the government continued to be secretive and would not disclose the total number of animals earmarked for slaughter so far, those slaughtered and those left unburied. Daily totals were issued until last week but when it became clear that the ministry was falling further and further behind with its programme and the disposal of carcasses the figures were withdrawn because they were \"inaccurate\". The figures also showed that the fact Tony Blair took charge of the crisis to improve slaughter times did not appear to have made any difference. Nick Brown, the agriculture minister who was concerned that the public was being kept in the dark about the progress of the disease, requested the Cabinet Office to release the figures yesterday. A spokeswoman for the Cabinet Office said that efforts were being made to update the figures so they were accurate. Last night the ministry website giving maps of restricted zones, details of outbreaks, and advice to farmers on what to do to combat getting the disease, and how to apply for licences was taken down. The only information available was that there had been 21 new cases up to 6.40pm yesterday bringing the total to 1,257. The last figure supplied a week ago was that nearly 400,000 carcasses remained to be destroyed and the numbers were still rising.

And we were immensely cheered by the surprise arrival of a giant basket of fruit and another of budding hyacinths sent to us by a friend in London. No doubt the contents were chosen to keep us all healthy and to mask the dreadful smells.</p> <p>However, more Northumbrian farms were confirmed as infected premises on Wednesday night, just as the government's advisers were trying to persuade the nation it is getting better. Not here, it isn't. The battle for Northumberland's livestock is being fought every day.</p> <p>Our landscape is bare. We are still feeding hay, which is unusual, because once lambing is well under way the grass usually starts to grow. We know spring has been cancelled, but now we wonder if summer will ever come. The weather remains cold and damp, with a raw north-easterly wind. And the putrid, smoky smell that lingers unpleasantly for hours was back yesterday.</p> <p>There are now around 10 triplet-bearing ewes left to lamb in the Mule flock. They are in the tiny paddock in front of our house. Thirteen sheep lambed with triplets on Wednesday. We have had a busy time setting the spare third lambs on to sheep with only one. It is quite an achievement to have only a handful of ewes running with three - especially this year - as the ban on movement means we can't pass on the spares to anyone else.</p> <p>There are three ways to persuade a ewe she has had two lambs when she may have only delivered one, or had one stillborn. First, if she has a dead lamb, the animal can be skinned. This little sheepskin jerkin is then put on the motherless lamb. It must be left on for three days, which is how long it takes for the foster ewe's milk to produce the right smell in the lamb. By the time we cut the hardened skin off, the aroma is interesting, to say the least.</p> <p>The second method is to use a specially constructed wooden pen known as \"the stocks\". Each set takes four ewes. They can all eat and drink, stand up and lie down, and smell or lick their lambs, but the sheep are unable to turn right around or push the lambs away if they think one is not theirs. Again this system takes three days for the right smell to work through the lamb's system and convince the ewe that these two bouncing baby sheep really do belong to her. After three days in the stocks, each ewe has a further 48 hours in a wooden pen to complete the bonding process, then it is off to the field.</p> <p>Occasionally, a stubborn ewe will have two sessions in the stocks. Even if she rejects one of the lambs, by the time she arrives outside the adopted lamb has learned enough to sneakily suckle from the rear, while the favoured lamb suckles the other side in a normal fashion.</p> <p>The third method is what we call a \"water set on\". Just as a single bearing ewe is about to deliver, we lay her down on her side in a cleaned pen on top of a plastic feed bag which has been split along the side. As the lamb arrives, we catch it and all the birthing waters in the split sack.</p> <p>The next step is to immerse the new arrival in a bucket of clean, warm water, to rinse off all the birthing fluids. Then we spray iodine on the navel and lay the lamb on clean straw. If the ewe has enough milk for two lambs - and they don't always - we then fetch a spare lamb to set on.</p> <p>This lamb, which may be several days old, is immersed in the same water. Then we slide the lamb all over the split sacking, coating the animal in as much of the birthing juices and material as we can. If the ewe still has a water bag showing, we burst this over the lamb's head and apply iodine to its navel too. Then we tell the proud mum she has two lambs, and scarper off to the other end of the shed, leaving her in peace. The family unit is kept inside for the same magic three days, to make sure that both lambs and mothers know each other well.</p> <p>Our adoption criterion is simple. It is done on a \"need-to-have\" basis. If a lamb needs a mother, or vice versa, we match them up. While we try approximately to match colour and size, gender and breed make no difference. In fact, some ewes have produced twins or triplets to different fathers. How do we know this? Well, Peter used two different breeds of ram, as in the middle of the breeding season we had a few calamities. But the lambs are arriving healthy and strong, and that is all that matters right now.</p> <p>The writer and her husband run a livestock farm near Heddon-on-the-Wall, Northumberland.

The Ministry of Agriculture fears the disease will run through farms as it did in Cumbria, where the disease has led to the slaughter of more than 500,000 animals. The total number of cases in Gloucestershire had risen to 73 last night with eight new cases reported in 24 hours. Outbreaks have occurred on both sides of the Severn but the most serious problem is in the Forest of Dean where the unfenced area is surrounded by hundreds of farms. A mass cull of all free roaming sheep in the open forest has failed to halt the spread of the disease. The government's chief scientist, David King, identified the area on Wednesday as one where the future course of the disease could not be predicted. All 7,500 unfenced sheep in the forest were rounded up between April 1 and 7 and slaughtered as a precaution but tests showed that the disease was already prevalent in the flock and it might have travelled much further to neighbouring farms. No decision had been made yesterday about how extensive the new cull might need to be.

      "body": "<p>General Electric's chief executive, Jack Welch, did not give a damn about the internet until one evening when he returned home from work and his wife sat him down in front of their home PC. </p> <p>Jane Welch had been idly searching the web and hit upon a site that would change her husband's opinion of the nascent technology for ever. </p> <p>\"Jane had been involved in the internet for years. I just didn't get it,\" he told CBS's 60 Minutes recently. \"She went to a Yahoo! message board on GE and they were talking about me. It was all gossip, rumours... 'God,' I go, 'This is really fascinating.' And then... I got hooked.\" </p> <p>Mr Welch is not the only one. </p> <p>Bulletin boards - or bitch boards as the most vitriolic are dubbed - are becoming an inescapable part of corporate culture. </p> <p>Executives at companies large and small are logging on to an ever-increasing number of boards and unofficial sites to find out exactly what staff, customers, partners and shareholders think of them. </p> <p>The most damning have the power to shatter share prices and employee morale in single stroke - regardless of whether the information and innuendo appearing on them is true or not. </p> <p><strong> Expectation of leaks</strong><br> </p> <p>The phenomenon has become a menace that even some of the world's smartest multinationals are unable to control. For many executives, surrounded by sycophantic advisers and isolated from reality, it can be an uncomfortable but often helpful wake-up call. And for a small number of firms specialising in web intelligence and crisis management public relations, it is opening up some potentially lucrative new revenue streams. </p> <p>\"Companies need to realise that now almost everyone at work has email, nothing is secret anymore - they must almost expect things to be leaked,\" said Nick Denton, founder of online news monitoring service Moreover.com. \"Email and the internet are making corporations more transparent. You mustn't say internally what you don't want heard externally because one way or another, it will eventually get out.\" </p> <p>The slowing economy, widespread job losses and growing number of business failures has been manna from heaven for bitch boards. They have been receiving anonymous information from disgruntled employees and disillusioned shareholders in record quantities. </p> <p>Fuckedcompany.com, a US website that has become the first port of call for the latest gossip on which dot.com is likely to be the next to go bust, last week saw its servers collapse under the weight of mail it received. </p> <p>Founded by 24-year-old Robert Kaplan, known as Pud to its 6m visitors and the 45,000 recipients of his email newsletter, it has virtually cornered the market for news on dot.coms going under. </p> <p>Visitors are invited to submit f**ks - rumours - about companies they think are f**ked - heading for the scrap heap. They are awarded points depending on how accurate their information turns out to be. More than 20,000 players have registered, 2,400 companies are supposedly set for failure, and Yahoo! recently named it Site of the Year. </p> <p>The site's content is irreverent, crude and at times downright nasty. Sometimes it is untrue but more often the information is absolutely spot on. Increasingly copies of original emails from senior executives containing price-sensitive information are being posted. </p> <p>Visitors delight in the latest staff culls, dissecting business models they claim with perfect hindsight that they always knew were doomed for failure. The effect on staff morale can be devastating. </p> <p>Charles Cohen, founder of troubled online payment firm Beenz.com, recently felt the full force of the site's vitriol when 30 particularly nasty, but largely true, individual postings were made on fuckedcompany.com the night before news of a huge round of sackings was made public. \"We took such a beating we thought about sending them some Beenz branded condoms to wear the next time they f**ked us,\" he said. </p> <p>It is not only dot.com start-ups that are exposed. Intel saw 11% wiped off its stock price and was forced to write off $500m after news of a production flaw in its new Pentium chip emerged on a discussion board in 1994. </p> <p>Three years later, fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger was accused of being racist after an internet rumour said he had appeared on the Oprah Winfrey Show and argued that his clothes were not meant to be worn by African-Americans. He was threatened by boycotts and activist groups - despite the fact that he had never appeared on the show. </p> <p>Last year Oracle's stock plunged 30% on false rumours that founder Larry Ellison had died. </p> <p>Specific anti-corporate websites have also been set up to knock household names such as Ford, Nike, Gap and Starbucks. McSpotlight.com, a site Greenpeace founded five years ago to highlight a court action the fast food company had taken against it, still averages about 1.5m hits a month. </p> <p>The damage rumours can inflict on a company and the speed at which they spread terrifies many firms. Share prices can be shattered in a single trading session. </p> <p>Nearly three-quarters of 600 prominent US chief executives recently surveyed by public relations firm Hill and Knowlton said they were concerned by the mounting dissemination of negative information over the internet - but only 50% have strategies in place for managing internet communications. </p> <p>Those who still dismiss the importance of the internet will be particularly alarmed by figures from last year's Ross Report of Cybermedia which found 60% of print journalists would report an online rumour with one confirmation. </p> <p>\"Companies recognise the increasing significance of corporate reputation to their bottom line,\" said Tom Hoog, president of Hill and Knowlton. </p> <p>Moreover.com's Mr Denton believes that the first hours after a rumour has appeared online are the most important. \"Companies should try to nip crises in the bud before they spread,\" he says. </p> <p>\"We live in a market of instant information where perception and image are increasingly linked to stock prices. The best strategic plans can be undermined in the course of a morning.\" </p> <p>Moreover.com offers what it describes as \"web intelligence\". Its sophisticated search technology constantly scans more than 2,400 online sources ranging from mainstream news sites to bulletin boards and gossip columns. It trawls areas which are neither visited nor indexed by traditional search engines, Mr Denton says. </p> <p>His target customers are marketing directors, investor relations managers and public relations partners. </p> <p>Firms are increasingly taking legal action to stop the spread of false rumours, but sources can be difficult to trace as most are posted anonymously. In the US, more than 150 lawsuits have been filed against anonymous message posters since 1999, citing libel, trade secret violation or stock manipulation. </p> <p><strong> Libellous remarks</strong><br> </p> <p>In Britain, AIM-listed internet service provider Totalise recently won a ruling in the High Court requiring financial web sites The Motley Fool and Interactive Investor International (iii) to reveal the identity of a person using the name Zeddust. He had posted libellous remarks about the Leeds-based firm on both sites. </p> <p>\"Initially, both Motley Fool and iii were approached to sort this problem out, but because of their reluctance to get involved directly, the court case became inevitable to protect and clarify certain comments about the company,\" chief executive Peter Gregory said. </p> <p>\"We responded after a long and sustained campaign from one particular poster whose posts went beyond the usual and acceptable discussions on the company. The posts were directly intended to besmirch the company or its directors. </p> <p>\"Obviously, we accept that everyone is entitled to their views, opinions and assessments of a company - Totalise has never sought to challenge these.\" </p> <p>Mr Gregory said he does not believe bulletin boards have a direct influence on share prices but his views are accompanied by a caveat. \"Any serious buyer, seller, or investor would be foolish to follow the [anonymous] comments you see on boards,\" he said.

      "bodyText": "General Electric's chief executive, Jack Welch, did not give a damn about the internet until one evening when he returned home from work and his wife sat him down in front of their home PC. Jane Welch had been idly searching the web and hit upon a site that would change her husband's opinion of the nascent technology for ever. \"Jane had been involved in the internet for years. I just didn't get it,\" he told CBS's 60 Minutes recently. \"She went to a Yahoo! message board on GE and they were talking about me. It was all gossip, rumours... 'God,' I go, 'This is really fascinating.' And then... I got hooked.\" Mr Welch is not the only one. Bulletin boards - or bitch boards as the most vitriolic are dubbed - are becoming an inescapable part of corporate culture. Executives at companies large and small are logging on to an ever-increasing number of boards and unofficial sites to find out exactly what staff, customers, partners and shareholders think of them. The most damning have the power to shatter share prices and employee morale in single stroke - regardless of whether the information and innuendo appearing on them is true or not. Expectation of leaks The phenomenon has become a menace that even some of the world's smartest multinationals are unable to control. For many executives, surrounded by sycophantic advisers and isolated from reality, it can be an uncomfortable but often helpful wake-up call. And for a small number of firms specialising in web intelligence and crisis management public relations, it is opening up some potentially lucrative new revenue streams. \"Companies need to realise that now almost everyone at work has email, nothing is secret anymore - they must almost expect things to be leaked,\" said Nick Denton, founder of online news monitoring service Moreover.com. \"Email and the internet are making corporations more transparent. You mustn't say internally what you don't want heard externally because one way or another, it will eventually get out.\" The slowing economy, widespread job losses and growing number of business failures has been manna from heaven for bitch boards. They have been receiving anonymous information from disgruntled employees and disillusioned shareholders in record quantities. Fuckedcompany.com, a US website that has become the first port of call for the latest gossip on which dot.com is likely to be the next to go bust, last week saw its servers collapse under the weight of mail it received. Founded by 24-year-old Robert Kaplan, known as Pud to its 6m visitors and the 45,000 recipients of his email newsletter, it has virtually cornered the market for news on dot.coms going under. Visitors are invited to submit f**ks - rumours - about companies they think are f**ked - heading for the scrap heap. They are awarded points depending on how accurate their information turns out to be. More than 20,000 players have registered, 2,400 companies are supposedly set for failure, and Yahoo! recently named it Site of the Year. The site's content is irreverent, crude and at times downright nasty. Sometimes it is untrue but more often the information is absolutely spot on. Increasingly copies of original emails from senior executives containing price-sensitive information are being posted. Visitors delight in the latest staff culls, dissecting business models they claim with perfect hindsight that they always knew were doomed for failure. The effect on staff morale can be devastating. Charles Cohen, founder of troubled online payment firm Beenz.com, recently felt the full force of the site's vitriol when 30 particularly nasty, but largely true, individual postings were made on fuckedcompany.com the night before news of a huge round of sackings was made public. \"We took such a beating we thought about sending them some Beenz branded condoms to wear the next time they f**ked us,\" he said. It is not only dot.com start-ups that are exposed. Intel saw 11% wiped off its stock price and was forced to write off $500m after news of a production flaw in its new Pentium chip emerged on a discussion board in 1994. Three years later, fashion designer Tommy Hilfiger was accused of being racist after an internet rumour said he had appeared on the Oprah Winfrey Show and argued that his clothes were not meant to be worn by African-Americans. He was threatened by boycotts and activist groups - despite the fact that he had never appeared on the show. Last year Oracle's stock plunged 30% on false rumours that founder Larry Ellison had died. Specific anti-corporate websites have also been set up to knock household names such as Ford, Nike, Gap and Starbucks. McSpotlight.com, a site Greenpeace founded five years ago to highlight a court action the fast food company had taken against it, still averages about 1.5m hits a month. The damage rumours can inflict on a company and the speed at which they spread terrifies many firms. Share prices can be shattered in a single trading session. Nearly three-quarters of 600 prominent US chief executives recently surveyed by public relations firm Hill and Knowlton said they were concerned by the mounting dissemination of negative information over the internet - but only 50% have strategies in place for managing internet communications. Those who still dismiss the importance of the internet will be particularly alarmed by figures from last year's Ross Report of Cybermedia which found 60% of print journalists would report an online rumour with one confirmation. \"Companies recognise the increasing significance of corporate reputation to their bottom line,\" said Tom Hoog, president of Hill and Knowlton. Moreover.com's Mr Denton believes that the first hours after a rumour has appeared online are the most important. \"Companies should try to nip crises in the bud before they spread,\" he says. \"We live in a market of instant information where perception and image are increasingly linked to stock prices. The best strategic plans can be undermined in the course of a morning.\" Moreover.com offers what it describes as \"web intelligence\". Its sophisticated search technology constantly scans more than 2,400 online sources ranging from mainstream news sites to bulletin boards and gossip columns. It trawls areas which are neither visited nor indexed by traditional search engines, Mr Denton says. His target customers are marketing directors, investor relations managers and public relations partners. Firms are increasingly taking legal action to stop the spread of false rumours, but sources can be difficult to trace as most are posted anonymously. In the US, more than 150 lawsuits have been filed against anonymous message posters since 1999, citing libel, trade secret violation or stock manipulation. Libellous remarks In Britain, AIM-listed internet service provider Totalise recently won a ruling in the High Court requiring financial web sites The Motley Fool and Interactive Investor International (iii) to reveal the identity of a person using the name Zeddust. He had posted libellous remarks about the Leeds-based firm on both sites. \"Initially, both Motley Fool and iii were approached to sort this problem out, but because of their reluctance to get involved directly, the court case became inevitable to protect and clarify certain comments about the company,\" chief executive Peter Gregory said. \"We responded after a long and sustained campaign from one particular poster whose posts went beyond the usual and acceptable discussions on the company. The posts were directly intended to besmirch the company or its directors. \"Obviously, we accept that everyone is entitled to their views, opinions and assessments of a company - Totalise has never sought to challenge these.\" Mr Gregory said he does not believe bulletin boards have a direct influence on share prices but his views are accompanied by a caveat. \"Any serious buyer, seller, or investor would be foolish to follow the [anonymous] comments you see on boards,\" he said. Sadly for Mr Gregory, the millions who log on to bulletin and bitch boards on a daily basis often disagree.

      "bodyText": "The military regime in Pakistan is to extend its investigation of corruption allegations against the former prime minister Benazir Bhutto after the release by a British court of 22,000 pages of documents detailing her bank accounts and assets. Ms Bhutto, who lives in self-imposed exile in London and Dubai, won a significant victory last week when the Pakistani supreme court overturned a conviction for corruption against her and her husband and ordered a retrial. She said she intended to return to Pakistan soon and would try to become prime minister for a third time. But yesterday Bow Street magistrates court in London released detailed financial documents about the couple and statements taken from nine associates. The Pakistani national accountability bureau (NAB), which investigates corruption, has been trying to secure the documents since the army seized power 17 months ago. It has not yet had sight of them. \"We believe these documents will show us the properties that they have acquired in other countries, the bank accounts they have got, and how the money they took from this country was either looted or acquired through illegal activity,\" the prosecutor general for corruption, Raja Bashir, said. \"We are absolutely sure that illegal money has been taken out of this country. \"We are looking at a figure of around $1.2bn [\u00a3830m].\" The bureau says the couple have 26 bank accounts in various parts of the world, own 14 properties, and have total assets of \u00a31bn. Mr Bashir said Ms Bhutto's successful appeal last week did not mean she had escaped punishment. \"Benazir Bhutto has not been acquitted. The court said try her again. We are very glad that other countries are cooperating with us.\" The bureau is bringing four more corruption cases against Ms Bhutto, including claims that she took kickbacks for awarding government contracts and illegally appointing 1,393 people to jobs in the state airline, PIA. Ms Bhutto denies all the charges and says they are a politically motivated attempt to prevent her returning to power. Her husband, Asif Ali Zardari, has been charged with six offences, including abusing his authority by building a polo ground at the prime minister's official residence for his personal use, and has been in jail for four years awaiting trial. A former senator, he is also allegedly implicated in the murder of his wife's brother Mir Murtaza Bhutto - which he denies - and accused of drug trafficking, a charge that carries the death penalty. His lawyers challenged the Bow Street court's decision to send the papers to Islamabad, saying it was being done only because of the drug trafficking charge, which they said was concocted to encourage London to cooperate in other corruption investigations. \"Mr Zardari has been unscrupulously drawn into corruption and narcotic charges which are a travesty of truth and justice,\" Ms Bhutto's Pakistan People's party said. In a separate development, the US authorities, acting on a request from the NAB, have arrested Mansur-ul Haq in connection with alleged bribes connected to a government purchase of three Agosta 90B submarines from France under a technology transfer agreement. Admiral Haq, who commanded the navy under Ms Bhutto's government in the mid-1990s, has been under investigation for at least three years. Two naval officers who served under him have been convicted of corruption by a court martial. The Pakistani supreme court is expected to rule today, or early next week, on several petitions which criticise the bureau's operations, particularly its power to hold suspects for 90 days without charge. Other allegations ... Against Benazir Bhutto Supreme court recently overturned conviction for alleged \u00a36.2m kickback for a contract to Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de Surveillance, a Swiss pre-shipment inspection firm. Retrial ordered. Alleged commission on 8,000 tractors from Poland. Kickbacks on granting a monopoly to a gold and silver importer - \u00a321m. Assets and accounts ' disproportionate to income'. Against Asif Ali Zardari Accused in four of his wife's corruption cases, except allegedly illegal appointments to the PIA state airline. Receiving \u00a3380,000 in commission from Pakistan Steel chairman for installing a new converter at a steel mill.

      "bodyText": "President Vladimir Putin's Unity party swallowed up a leading opposition group in an unexpected merger yesterday, providing him with a radically strengthened grip on parliament. The marriage of Mr Putin's party to the Fatherland bloc ensures that he now controls the biggest single group in parliament, amounting to at least 132 dedicated supporters. He is likely to be able to muster another 100 votes from smaller parties in the 450-seat house, making the passage of government legislation much simpler. The mayor of Moscow, Yury Luzhkov, who 18 months ago was one of Mr Putin's fiercest political enemies and one of his strongest potential rivals for the presidency, abandoned his independent stance. As the leader of the Fatherland movement, he announced that he and his bloc would now side with the party wholly responsible for the destruction of his presidential ambitions. Unity was created in the autumn of 1999 by shrewd Kremlin consultants primarily to drain support from Fatherland-All Russia, led by Mr Luzhkov and the former prime-minister Yevgeny Primakov. \"A new era is beginning in the history of Russia,\" Mr Luzhkov said yesterday. \"We have been throwing stones [at each other] for a long time and now it is time to pick those stones back up.\" Forces supporting the Kremlin now not only have the power to vote down the Communists and their allies the Agrarian bloc, which musters around 127 seats, but are also in a stronger position to solicit enough support to give the president the simply majority of 226 votes needed to pass most legislation. This should prove vital to Mr Putin as he tries to push through unpopular cost-cutting measures, such as the wholesale reform of pensions. The leader of Narodny Deputat, another central political bloc, said yesterday that he was also considering joining the merger. The merger is seen as the latest step in Mr Putin's campaign to consolidate his hold on Russian political institutions, and he welcomed the announcement as a \"constructive step on the way to reforming Russia's political system\", his spokesman said. The decision was seen as a debacle for Mr Luzhkov, however. \"Unity has devoured Fatherland - this is a tough defeat for Luzhkov's group,\" Sergei Ivanenko, of the liberal Yabloko group, said. \"The new party will be dominated by Unity. The Kremlin can view this as a victory.\" \u0095 The former senior Kremlin aide Pavel Borodin was released from custody in Geneva yesterday after Moscow paid a bond of 5m Swiss francs (\u00a32m). He still faces a charge of money-laundering kickbacks from Kremlin renovation deals.",

The inspiration behind this splendid investment opportunity was Morgan Stanley, which rarely dips its toes into such small-cap pond life. It is easy to suspect that the American bank felt its time was better spent on larger clients - AorTech is worth a \"mere\" half a billion. The ever-reliable Japanese have stepped in to show that it is possible to attract funds for decent technology, even in the present climate. Nomura has got the offering away, but not without some human cost - Eddie and Gordon are each having to stump up \u00a3120,000 to subscribe for their entitlements. Their hopes of realising a portion of their stakes have been dashed, and any thoughts of Ferraris, yachts and ponies will have to go on ice. Still, times are not too hard for Celtic pair - their stakes are still worth \u00a314m each, and Eddie still had the cash to dash off for a week in the sun yesterday. Hope he remembers to send a postcard to his rescuers at Nomura.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>\u0095 Douglas McWilliams, \"chief economist of the Centre for Economics and Business Research\", has made a career from bloodcurdling predictions of catastrophe. Three weeks ago his \"estimate\" that foot and mouth would cost \u00a39bn was splashed in the Sunday Times. Now Doug has cut that \u00a39bn down to a net impact of just \u00a36.3bn. Doug modestly claims his first figure provoked the PM to take charge of the crisis. \"Although he still did his best to try to shoot the messenger,\" writes Doug, \"by claiming that our estimate was 'plucked from the air'.\" Later in his press release Doug defends his original \u00a39bn as \"90% right at a time when hardly any information was available\" or, to put it another way, plucked from the air. The Sunday Times called Doug \"Professor McWilliams\", but when asked he says: \"I'm not a professor. I'm an ex-professor.\" Hmm. A press release from B&amp;Q dated April 10 also describes him as Professor McWilliams. But Doug says he doesn't use his old title from prestigious Kingston University: \"It cuts down my consultancy fees.\" </p> <p>\u0095 So who was the mysterious \"London stockbroker\" who paid an \u00a311,000 tip in a restaurant in New York, to a blaze of publicity? Some reports named the man as a \"Jeff Collins\", said to be a vice-president of brokers Collins Stewart. But the firm say it is not true. \"Not guilty,\" said one staff member, \"we don't even have any vice-presidents.\" </p> <p>\u0095 How policy is made: on Monday the deputy prime minister gathered transport journalists in his office to talk about railway fares. When one mentioned that a return fare on Virgin from London to Manchester was \u00a3150, Prescott huffed that was just the first class fare. No, said the hack, that's for standard. Prescott was so surprised at the amount he ordered a civil servant to check. The official returned to confirm to the man in charge of the nation's railways that it was indeed \u00a3150 for a standard open return. Prescott promptly announced a fares inquiry. </p> <p>\u0095 Just in time for Easter comes this circular from NTL to its cable TV subscribers: \"The God Channel (formerly known as the Christian Channel) will be charged at \u00a35 per month.\" </p> <p>\u0095 It has become very fashionable for universities to get out and raise money from the private sector, with a number of Britain's finest academic institutions regularly announcing fundraising totals running into hundreds of millions of pounds. But now the development directors (the ones who actually do the fundraising) of several leading universities are calling for a code of conduct to stop some institutions inflating their fundraising figures. The tricky devils add in funds from government sources, intellectual property rights, European Union grants and funding bodies, which doesn't count as fundraising proper. \"Basically a lot of vice chancellors are prepared to go over the top to produce big figures, and the only way they can do that is by lying,\" said one development director. </p> <p>\u0095 If you are employed by PricewaterhouseCoopers and are reading this at work today, please check the canteen menu. \"Bank Holiday,\" it reads, \"DON'T COME IN TO WORK.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Entries are rushing in for the inaugural Sophie Wessex Awards for PR excellence. The judges - Prince Andrew, Murray Harkin and ex-Sunday Mirror editor Colin Myler - will be looking for outstanding examples of this respected industry. The first is from Roskill Information Services: \"Consolidation puts increased pressure on primary molybdenum producers\". The next is from Churchill Insurance's press office: \"One in four people have run out of petrol.\" What, all at once? Finally, from pet insurer Primary Direct: \"Danger - Easter Eggs can kill!\" On that note, have a happy Easter. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:richard.adams@theguardian.com\">richard.adams@theguardian.com</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "\u0095 Douglas McWilliams, \"chief economist of the Centre for Economics and Business Research\", has made a career from bloodcurdling predictions of catastrophe. Three weeks ago his \"estimate\" that foot and mouth would cost \u00a39bn was splashed in the Sunday Times. Now Doug has cut that \u00a39bn down to a net impact of just \u00a36.3bn. Doug modestly claims his first figure provoked the PM to take charge of the crisis. \"Although he still did his best to try to shoot the messenger,\" writes Doug, \"by claiming that our estimate was 'plucked from the air'.\" Later in his press release Doug defends his original \u00a39bn as \"90% right at a time when hardly any information was available\" or, to put it another way, plucked from the air. The Sunday Times called Doug \"Professor McWilliams\", but when asked he says: \"I'm not a professor. I'm an ex-professor.\" Hmm. A press release from B&amp;Q dated April 10 also describes him as Professor McWilliams. But Doug says he doesn't use his old title from prestigious Kingston University: \"It cuts down my consultancy fees.\" \u0095 So who was the mysterious \"London stockbroker\" who paid an \u00a311,000 tip in a restaurant in New York, to a blaze of publicity? Some reports named the man as a \"Jeff Collins\", said to be a vice-president of brokers Collins Stewart. But the firm say it is not true. \"Not guilty,\" said one staff member, \"we don't even have any vice-presidents.\" \u0095 How policy is made: on Monday the deputy prime minister gathered transport journalists in his office to talk about railway fares. When one mentioned that a return fare on Virgin from London to Manchester was \u00a3150, Prescott huffed that was just the first class fare. No, said the hack, that's for standard. Prescott was so surprised at the amount he ordered a civil servant to check. The official returned to confirm to the man in charge of the nation's railways that it was indeed \u00a3150 for a standard open return. Prescott promptly announced a fares inquiry. \u0095 Just in time for Easter comes this circular from NTL to its cable TV subscribers: \"The God Channel (formerly known as the Christian Channel) will be charged at \u00a35 per month.\" \u0095 It has become very fashionable for universities to get out and raise money from the private sector, with a number of Britain's finest academic institutions regularly announcing fundraising totals running into hundreds of millions of pounds. But now the development directors (the ones who actually do the fundraising) of several leading universities are calling for a code of conduct to stop some institutions inflating their fundraising figures. The tricky devils add in funds from government sources, intellectual property rights, European Union grants and funding bodies, which doesn't count as fundraising proper. \"Basically a lot of vice chancellors are prepared to go over the top to produce big figures, and the only way they can do that is by lying,\" said one development director. \u0095 If you are employed by PricewaterhouseCoopers and are reading this at work today, please check the canteen menu. \"Bank Holiday,\" it reads, \"DON'T COME IN TO WORK.\" \u0095 Entries are rushing in for the inaugural Sophie Wessex Awards for PR excellence. The judges - Prince Andrew, Murray Harkin and ex-Sunday Mirror editor Colin Myler - will be looking for outstanding examples of this respected industry. The first is from Roskill Information Services: \"Consolidation puts increased pressure on primary molybdenum producers\". The next is from Churchill Insurance's press office: \"One in four people have run out of petrol.\" What, all at once? Finally, from pet insurer Primary Direct: \"Danger - Easter Eggs can kill!\" On that note, have a happy Easter. richard.adams@theguardian.com",

      "bodyText": "Lionel Jospin's quarrelsome leftwing coalition held emergency talks yesterday on a pre-electoral agenda against the background of street protests and popular disillusion. But a proposed series of mini-reforms, including greater job security, a higher minimum wage and more help for the young, may not be enough to reunite the multi-party gauche plurielle . With differences between his Socialists and the Communists, Greens and other allies becoming more and more public, Mr Jospin - who will go on television next week to outline the new priorities - has hinted that he may drop out of next spring's presidential election because his government lacks cohesion. His irritability has encouraged speculation whether he can stand the pace of life at the top. Dominique Voynet, the environment minister, has advised him to take a holiday after a series of incidents, including the noisy reprimand of two women journalists and the hostile public reaction when he visited flooded areas of the Somme. A temporary walkway in flooded Abbeville was dismantled by angry residents during his visit and, in one of the many references to Holy Week, much was made of his inability to walk on water. Yesterday's gathering was inevitably compared to the Last Supper before the hoped-for resurrection of his government, severely mauled in local elections in March in which several ministers were beaten. Recriminations for the setback have sharpened the determination of both the Greens, who did well after attacking the government's environmental record, and the Communist party, which did badly before blaming Mr Jospin, 63, for neglecting a leftwing philosophy. The elections have been followed by workers' protests, including national strikes by railwaymen, bus drivers and mid wives, the fallout from the Marks &amp; Spencer affair, and farmers' demonstrations which have forced Mr Jospin to cancel provincial visits. Marchers in Paris yesterday supported trade union demands for companies which sacked workers while announcing big dividends to be punished: a reference to plant closures by the processed food company Danone. Other high-profile redundancies threaten the government's target of reducing unemployment to less than 2m before the national polls. The midwives' strike has been particularly hard on Mr Jospin because his mother, Mireille, 90, is a midwife and has backed the protesters. But the feeling that he has become increasingly isolated since he unexpectedly won the 1997 general election is also noticeable in the media. His reaction to press criticism led to the virulent reprimand of two journalists during an official flight from Brazil, because they reported his admission that the right had won the local elections. The planned departure of the outspoken environment minister in June, to prepare for the presidential and parliamentary elections, could ease some of the tension in the coalition, where her frequent sarcasm has irked colleagues. But Mr Jospin's most trusted allies, Martine Aubry and Dominique Strauss-Kahn, have left the cabinet - the first to become mayor of Lille and the second because of a corruption scandal. Socialist officials deny reports of \"panic\" in the party, saying that Mr Jospin has already taken matters in hand. But there is noticeable concern at his impulsiveness. A former education minister and Socialist first-secretary, Mr Jospin wanted to give up politics and return to the diplomatic service when the left lost the 1995 national elections, before internal recriminations led to the suicide of the defeated Socialist prime minister, Pierre B\u00e9r\u00e9govoy.",

      "bodyText": "A bank robber called Clemente Perez walked free from jail yesterday. He took his first shuffling steps through the crowded streets of Malaga old town in a black tunic with a black cloth sack draped over his head. In front of him walked 300 white-and-purple-gowned nazarenos of the Jesus El Rico brotherhood, their faces hidden by the tall conical masked hats typical of Spain's Easter processions. The annual pardon given to a prisoner from the city jail is a high point in a week of popular religious outpouring in southern Spain during Easter week. Malaga, Seville and Cordoba come to a standstill as the various lay brotherhoods take statues of Jesus and the Virgin Mary from their church altars and parade them through the streets. Thousands of people don the nazareno outfits - infamously copied by the Ku Klux Klan - in an act of communal penance. This year the long tunics and conical hats hide the first female nazarenos to have joined many of the centuries-old conservative hermandades (brotherhoods). Archbishop Carlos Amigo invited women who were refused permission to be nazarenos to take their complaints to him. Mr Perez, 44, a former fisherman who says he turned to robbing banks to support his wife and three children, was the recipient of an annual pardon established 300 years ago by King Carlos III. His release, approved at a cabinet meeting, saved him from serving the final five years of a 12-year term. According to legend, the tradition was born when prison ers from the city jail broke out on Easter night and, disguised as nazarenos, paraded a statue of Jesus around the town. They returned to jail voluntarily the same night, but only after performing the miracle of bringing an outbreak of bubonic plague to a sudden end. Mr Perez spent his first hours of freedom walking through the streets of Malaga old town to the dirge-like music of a brass band and followed by a huge carved wood altar to Jesus El Rico. The gilded baroque altar was carried on the shoulders of 200 men, who manoeuvred it through the narrow streets under the shadow of the Moorish Alcazaba fort. \"He has been a model prisoner and is fully rehabilitated. But this pardon is conditional on him not returning to crime,\" the civil governor of Malaga warned. Prisoners pardoned in recent years have not always heeded the warning. One was back in jail within months. Murderers and violent criminals can no longer apply for the annual pardon. The last prisoner with blood on his hands to be released created such a public uproar that authorities decided not to repeat the experience. Rivalry between hermandades is intense.

Members of Mr Berlusconi's party, Forza Italia, have also been given an election kit, consisting of a videotape, horoscope and leaflets about their leader. Enclosed is a manual with tips on canvassing and electioneering, to be learned by heart by those hoping to become \"perfect candidates\". The book is printed by his publishing house, Mondadori. \"An exceptional triumph of the ego,\" commented the Turin daily La Stampa, noting that most of the photographs show a slimmer, less bald leader of at least six years ago. \"It will restore the truth after so many lies,\" countered a Forza Italia spokesman. Polls suggest that Mr Berlusconi's coalition, which includes other rightwing parties, will beat the centre-left government in the May 13 vote despite a narrowing lead. In between kissing babies, picking flowers, feeding his daughter and jogging, Mr Berlusconi, who is the owner of the football club AC Milan, is shown meeting world leaders. Margaret Thatcher, his idol, makes it into one of the cover's 49 photographs; so does the actor Sylvester Stallone, aka the boxer Rocky, whose gloved fist is seen being raised by the media magnate. One section, \"The little secrets of Silvio\", reveals his passion for medieval mysticism, music, gardening and reading the classics of western philosophy while holidaying in the Bahamas. \"Of the big [secrets] there is no mention, for now,\" said La Repubblica. Since falling from power in 1994 Mr Berlusconi has fended off multiple corruption charges.",

I didn't recognise it until I was older, but I was exhibiting early signs of anorexia. My sister, like your daughter, is a compulsive overeater. Anorexic and addictive eating disorders are often found together in families. Your children can get help by attending Overeaters Anonymous meetings where people with all types of eating disorders are given support. </p> <p>You will have to look at why your children are unhappy. Outside pressures such as exams and teenage angst only traumatise us if we are fragile in the first place. My dysfunctional behaviour was a direct result of my parents' behaviour. I don't blame them - they didn't know any better - but we know that if I'd come from a happy home I wouldn't have starved myself. </p> <p>It is painful to come out of denial and look honestly at why things aren't the way we want them to be. I agree with your wife that your son's problems are psychological; mine were. Perhaps you and your wife could attend counselling instead of separating?

If and when she wishes to do something about it she will. Having had a \"weight problem\" my entire life (the problem being other people's attitudes) I can say that the more you nag or complain the less likely she is to do anything about it. </p> <p>I imagine that seeing their parents row less often would be a boost for both of your children, although both actually seem to be displaying fairly normal behaviour. Perhaps the \"problem\" lies with you and you should comply with your wife's wishes and depart forthwith. </p> <p> Mark Jones, Leicester. </p> <p><b> See a family therapist</b><br> </p> <p> Your daughter is in the middle of her exam years, a stressful period. This is also a time of life when issues of boyfriends, keeping up with peers and leaving home can weigh heavily. She may be feeling under pressure from your distress at her weight and \"disappointing\" exam results. Both your children are expressing their distress loud and clear. The situation between you and your wife is undoubtedly affecting all four of you. </p> <p>The risk is that your children's coping strategies may become chronic: eating disorders, social isolation and depression can devastate their lives. Have you thought of consulting a family therapist? This would give you and your wife an opportunity to work out your differences and your children a chance to think safely about their worries, and allow all of you to move on from the unhappiness you are trapped in.

Your wife is using it as an excuse as it sounds as if she's given up on you and the children.

Over their 33 years of marriage, they have used their minor royal status to carve out an existence for themselves that provides a constant round of world travel to promote a vast array of business and charitable organisations. Now, after the Sophie tapes affair, there is growing concern about the Kents' activities among senior diplomatic and Buckingham Palace figures, who fear that the couple's endless globetrotting is tarnishing the international reputation of the royal family. The prince does not carry out any official engagements on behalf of the Queen, but a glance through his diary since the start of January last year reveals the extraordinary scale of his travelling. During the last 15 months he has been on more than 20 trips to destinations ranging from Dublin to Australia, as a representative or guest of more than 100 organisations.

According to senior ministerial sources, the prince is still treading a similarly thin line on some of his trips. A spokesman for the prince, however, denied the claims out of hand. Dismayed The Kents defend their travelling on the basis that the vast majority of it is on behalf of good causes, but diplomatic and palace sources have been dismayed by the obscure nature of some of the organisations they the couple lend their support to. In April last year, for example, the prince travelled to Singapore and Australia as patron of a medical charity, the World Health Network Foundation, the \"ethical watchdog\" of a commercial venture called World Health Network which allows doctors around the world to share information via the internet. Inquiries by the Guardian have established that neither the World Health Organisation, British Medical Association nor the Royal College of Medicine were previously aware of its existence. Much of the prince's work involves representing two business organisations, the British Security Industry Association, with whom he travelled to Dubai and Athens in the past year, and the Russo-British Chamber of Commerce, under whose auspices he travelled to Russia at least twice in the last year. A hitherto unnoticed memorandum from the RBCC, of which the prince is patron, to the Commons foreign affairs committee in 1999 sheds some light on the tensions between the Foreign Office and the prince.

Lectures Princess Michael is also a keen traveller. Her main vehicle is a twice-yearly lecture tour of the United States, which involves speaking at dinners on art and history topics, with titles such as Louis XIV: Substance and the Show. All the money raised from the lectures goes to charity. While the Kents are at pains to insist that they travel as private individuals, before going abroad on a trip, they always meet with the London ambassador of the host country, either at the embassy or at Kensington Palace. On January 8 this year, for example, the prince went to the Peruvian embassy to discuss the arrangements for a visit by the princess with the ambassador and other officials. The meeting took place even though the princess was travelling to Peru in February on a private visit as a guest of Jim Sherwood, founder and president of the Sea Containers Group and head of Orient Express Hotels. The prince's spokesman insisted that the prince had not met the ambassador to request facilities from the Peruvian government. \"When they go to a country, it is something that people are interested in and it would be quite wrong and lacking in manners not to meet with the ambassador of that country.\" But several leading British charities and business organisations involved in organising visits overseas with celebrities and famous patrons told the Guardian yesterday that they never felt it necessary to have meetings at ambassador level ahead of their trips.

      "body": "<p>I remember the tenuous hold we used to have on movies before the home-video revolution. The way a film such as Night Moves or Who'll Stop the Rain would burn in your brain all the more brightly because you had to rely on memory alone, and because you might not see it again for years. How the almost religious experience of seeing Vertigo or The Merchant of Four Seasons for the first time would simply have evaporated if you had been able to rewind to your favourite moments there and then. </p> <p>Some of them, of course, did not endure. It would turn out, when finally you did see the film again, that you had misconstrued the proportions, or simply sucked out its pulp and pith in one viewing. The survivors, those films to which your second reaction was as ecstatic as your first, went on to become lifelong friends. </p> <p>Today I find that I can replicate this shaky relationship only with films that are not available in any format whatsoever, and it leads me to wonder if some of my favourite movies might be ones I've never seen at all. </p> <p>There are many reasons for their unavailability. Sometimes ownership rights are disputed, with legal gridlock preventing release. Such is the case with the legendary pot-head classics El Topo and The Holy Mountain. Their director, Alejandro Jodorowsky, will tell anyone who'll listen that he believes Beatles manager Allen Klein, who owns the rights, destroyed both movies out of spite years ago. Other cases are more prosaic, but keep us from seeing - in the US, at least - such classics as Anthony Mann's Dostoyevsky western The Furies, Sam Fuller's Forty Guns and House of Bamboo, Nicholas Ray's Bigger Than Life, and Douglas Sirk's There's Always Tomorrow. I've also long had an unscratchable itch to see lost 1970s movies like Aloha, Bobby and Rose, starring Paul Le Mat, the sleazy LA drug drama Cisco Pike, or novelist Tom McGuane's directorial effort, 92 in the Shade. Occasionally there are shafts of light in the murk, such as the recent reissue of Monte Helman's little classics Cockfighter and Two-Lane Blacktop in widescreen, but beyond such infrequent blessings the best I can do is pray. </p> <p> Other movies are of such limited interest as to make video distribution simply prohibitive. America's narrow appetite for imported, sub- titled movies means that Alain Resnais's Muriel and Satyajit Ray's Days and Nights in the Forest can be found only on shagged-out, decade-old videos from companies that no longer exist. As films, they have vanished. And no one is likely to renovate Luchino Visconti's shoddily maintained oeuvre just because I fancy seeing a decent Technicolor print of Senso or The Leopard. What chance do we have of seeing Jean-Marie Straub and Danielle Huillet's austere The Bridegroom, The Comedienne and the Pimp, or Chris Marker's The Last Bolshevik, or Rivette's 12-hour Out 1/Spectre, which I believe has only ever been screened once? I also understand that Chris Petit's Radio On - an auditorum-emptier that I've thrilled to no less than seven times - will probably never make it to video simply because it is too murky and dark to be seen on a TV screen. So what? It lives in my head. </p> <p>Then there is the rich, broad strain of underground film-making that partakes more of the art world or radical politics than of Hollywood. Directors such as Jon Jost and James Bening used to be present at every screening of their films, because of their perceived inaccessibility. Jost is now well served on video (apart from his death-hymn to LA, Angel City), but Bening still wanders America like an itinerant showman, bearing cinematic gifts to campuses and film clubs in the boot of his car. </p> <p>In the most extreme cases, underground directors withdrew their work from distribution altogether, such as the late Gregory Markropolous and his partner Robert Beavers. Beavers' movies (which, I am told, are extraordinarily beautiful) are unseeable in any form, so tightly does the director control them. When they are shown in Washington, DC, this May, it will be the first time they have been exhibited in America since 1974. It's 3,000 miles and a fortune to get there, but I'm going. </p> <p>Sometimes the big boys adopt the tactics of such small fry. Kubrick did it in the UK by withdrawing A Clockwork Orange, which thus had a virtually samizdat existence for nearly 30 years. And Alfred Hitchcock held back five of his own movies - including Rear Window and Vertigo - that weren't re-released until several years after his death, presumably with a view to enhancing his posthumous reputation. </p> <p>But whatever the reasons I can't see, or re-see, many of these movies, I like the fact that they're out there in the ether, waiting for me to unearth them, demanding my ingenuity and doggedness. Together they represent a Pandora's box of unrealised possibilities, a vault stacked with high hopes, and a place where one can feel like an optimist again. I'm patient. I've already waited two decades to see many of them, and some of them I know I'll never see at all. In their absence I have simply imagined them, and the movies I have thus conjured up are unlike anything I've ever seen.</p>",

      "bodyText": "I remember the tenuous hold we used to have on movies before the home-video revolution. The way a film such as Night Moves or Who'll Stop the Rain would burn in your brain all the more brightly because you had to rely on memory alone, and because you might not see it again for years. How the almost religious experience of seeing Vertigo or The Merchant of Four Seasons for the first time would simply have evaporated if you had been able to rewind to your favourite moments there and then. Some of them, of course, did not endure. It would turn out, when finally you did see the film again, that you had misconstrued the proportions, or simply sucked out its pulp and pith in one viewing. The survivors, those films to which your second reaction was as ecstatic as your first, went on to become lifelong friends. Today I find that I can replicate this shaky relationship only with films that are not available in any format whatsoever, and it leads me to wonder if some of my favourite movies might be ones I've never seen at all. There are many reasons for their unavailability. Sometimes ownership rights are disputed, with legal gridlock preventing release. Such is the case with the legendary pot-head classics El Topo and The Holy Mountain. Their director, Alejandro Jodorowsky, will tell anyone who'll listen that he believes Beatles manager Allen Klein, who owns the rights, destroyed both movies out of spite years ago. Other cases are more prosaic, but keep us from seeing - in the US, at least - such classics as Anthony Mann's Dostoyevsky western The Furies, Sam Fuller's Forty Guns and House of Bamboo, Nicholas Ray's Bigger Than Life, and Douglas Sirk's There's Always Tomorrow. I've also long had an unscratchable itch to see lost 1970s movies like Aloha, Bobby and Rose, starring Paul Le Mat, the sleazy LA drug drama Cisco Pike, or novelist Tom McGuane's directorial effort, 92 in the Shade. Occasionally there are shafts of light in the murk, such as the recent reissue of Monte Helman's little classics Cockfighter and Two-Lane Blacktop in widescreen, but beyond such infrequent blessings the best I can do is pray. Other movies are of such limited interest as to make video distribution simply prohibitive. America's narrow appetite for imported, sub- titled movies means that Alain Resnais's Muriel and Satyajit Ray's Days and Nights in the Forest can be found only on shagged-out, decade-old videos from companies that no longer exist. As films, they have vanished. And no one is likely to renovate Luchino Visconti's shoddily maintained oeuvre just because I fancy seeing a decent Technicolor print of Senso or The Leopard. What chance do we have of seeing Jean-Marie Straub and Danielle Huillet's austere The Bridegroom, The Comedienne and the Pimp, or Chris Marker's The Last Bolshevik, or Rivette's 12-hour Out 1/Spectre, which I believe has only ever been screened once? I also understand that Chris Petit's Radio On - an auditorum-emptier that I've thrilled to no less than seven times - will probably never make it to video simply because it is too murky and dark to be seen on a TV screen. So what? It lives in my head. Then there is the rich, broad strain of underground film-making that partakes more of the art world or radical politics than of Hollywood. Directors such as Jon Jost and James Bening used to be present at every screening of their films, because of their perceived inaccessibility. Jost is now well served on video (apart from his death-hymn to LA, Angel City), but Bening still wanders America like an itinerant showman, bearing cinematic gifts to campuses and film clubs in the boot of his car. In the most extreme cases, underground directors withdrew their work from distribution altogether, such as the late Gregory Markropolous and his partner Robert Beavers. Beavers' movies (which, I am told, are extraordinarily beautiful) are unseeable in any form, so tightly does the director control them. When they are shown in Washington, DC, this May, it will be the first time they have been exhibited in America since 1974. It's 3,000 miles and a fortune to get there, but I'm going. Sometimes the big boys adopt the tactics of such small fry. Kubrick did it in the UK by withdrawing A Clockwork Orange, which thus had a virtually samizdat existence for nearly 30 years. And Alfred Hitchcock held back five of his own movies - including Rear Window and Vertigo - that weren't re-released until several years after his death, presumably with a view to enhancing his posthumous reputation. But whatever the reasons I can't see, or re-see, many of these movies, I like the fact that they're out there in the ether, waiting for me to unearth them, demanding my ingenuity and doggedness. Together they represent a Pandora's box of unrealised possibilities, a vault stacked with high hopes, and a place where one can feel like an optimist again. I'm patient. I've already waited two decades to see many of them, and some of them I know I'll never see at all. In their absence I have simply imagined them, and the movies I have thus conjured up are unlike anything I've ever seen.",

In my day, an easy time of it consisted of lazing in bed, snoozing through Gardeners' Question Time. </p> <p>But then my lecturers weren't researching the wonderful world of animal navigation, how grey whales and green turtles find their long distance migratory ways or whether an animal that knows how to get from A to B, and B to C, can compute a shortcut from A to C.

In my day, an easy time of it consisted of lazing in bed, snoozing through Gardeners' Question Time. But then my lecturers weren't researching the wonderful world of animal navigation, how grey whales and green turtles find their long distance migratory ways or whether an animal that knows how to get from A to B, and B to C, can compute a shortcut from A to C.

Millbank's intervention follows criticism by a former NEC member, Liz Davies, of Ms McDonagh's attempts to stifle debate. The party hierarchy has launched a determined drive to reduce the influence of the grassroots alliance which holds two of the six constituency seats on the NEC and is running a slate in the election. Brighton Kemptown's general management committee last month nominated Willie Sullivan, Scottish Labour's former development officer and a critic of Millbank's \"machine-style\" politics. But after phone calls from Alicia Chayter in Ms McDonagh's office, the nomination was switched to Lady Gould who lives in Brighton and needed local endorsement to stand under party rules. Mr Sullivan's supporters claim a number of Brighton officials were wrongly told he had agreed to withdraw and Millbank even offered to \"arrange\" another constituency to support him.

Malle recalled that \"it must have been very hard for Jean-Marc Bory to do the role, as Jeanne and I were in the middle of a great love affair, living together, arriving on set and leaving together. The whole thing of doing the love scenes must have been very tough for Bory. The love scenes were difficult for all of us.

The rest of the time he was sleeping or sunbathing.\"</p> <p>Bory, who was 24 at the time, said that he had forgotten doing the love scene, and that he never again met Moreau, who was six years his senior. In fact, Bory refused any similar role, saying that it wasn't the sort of thing he sought to do by becoming an actor. Consequently, though he appeared in films into the 1990s, his career suffered somewhat.</p> <p>The Swiss-born Bory, who had a love of theatre instilled in him by his parents, had a parallel career on stage. After studying acting in Switzerland, he left for Paris at the age of 19. After his film debut in The Lovers projected him into the limelight, Bory worked with many of France's leading directors, including Abel Gance (Austerlitz, 1960), Michel Deville (Adorable Liar, 1961) and Pierre Kast (Vacances Portugais, 1963). For Roger Vadim in Warrior's Rest (1962), in contrast to his role in The Lovers, he played the respectable fianc\u00e9 of good girl Brigitte Bardot before she meets a man who initiates her into the joys of uninhibited sex (Robert Hossein).</p> <p>Bory's stage appearances ranged from Kleist's Catherine de Heilbronn, directed by Eric Rohmer, to Samuel Beckett's Endgame, and he was well known and respected at the National Theatres of Lyon and Strasbourg. In the 1998 Avignon festival, a grey-bearded Bory played the Chorus in Oedipus the Tyrant, Holderlin's adaptation of Sophocles, accompanied by three of his five children.

Women over 40 who are having their first child are up to 14 times more likely to have the operation as those under 30, a study has found. The findings, published in the British Medical Journal, have again raised concern that many women are having unnecessary caesareans.",

      "bodyText": "A new type of antibiotic hailed as a key weapon against antibiotic-resistant hospital \"superbugs\" may already be losing its power, scientists warned yesterday. Linezolid, promoted as the first in a new class of antibiotic for 35 years, was only licensed in Britain four months ago. But evidence from the United States suggests that harmful bacteria have already built up resistance to the drug, sold under the brand name Zyvox. Doctors in this country last night remained cautiously optimistic that the drug could still cut the 100,000 infections caught by British patients each year while in hospital. With 5,000 deaths a year, experts have warned gloomily of a return to \"dark ages\" of medicine if hospitals do not soon get a grip on fighting the new endemic antibiotic-resistant diseases with effective drugs and vastly improved hygiene procedures. The concern over Zyvox so early in its commercial life will be seen as a salutary reminder of just how versatile bacteria are, partly because of cavalier overuse of antibiotics for the past 50 years in medicine and in farming. Concern at the waning powers of what were once regarded as wonder-drugs has brought firm political action only in the last three years and many critics do not believe enough is being done to educate the public, doctors or farmers of the need to cut their routine use. Linezolid, approved by the US food and drug administration last April, is being used to treat patients suffering from pneumonia and other infections associated with VRE, one of the so-called superbugs. Pharmacia, the makers, say it works in two thirds of cases and actual bacterial resistance had been found in only a handful of those. A study published in the Lancet yesterday found that one in 45 patients may have a resistance to the new drug. The findings will come as a blow to scientists, who believed Linezolid could overcome the most virulent bacteria, including vancomycin-resistant organisms that cause many potentially deadly infections. Doctors from the University of Illinois College of Medicine in Chicago studied Linezolid's success in treating five patients suffering from the vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (VRE). It was initially effective in all five patients, but over a period of weeks, the tests showed that the bacteria were beginning to develop a resistance to the drug. In three of the cases, the Linezolid treatment eventually failed as patients grew unresponsive to the drug. Doctors here will be eagerly awaiting the results. The public health laboratory service specialist Alan Johnston said: \"We had hoped there would be quite a long period before we saw clincial problems with the occurrence of resistance [in Zyvox].

Cameron Durrant, vice-president for infectious diseases at Pharmacia, said the Chicago patients were \"very sick\" and the results confirmed the company's own laboratory and clinical studies. \"We have now had in excess of 60,000 patients treated with Zyvox and we are talking about a small number of cases , limited to a very small group.

Brian Hughes Cheltenham, Glos \u0095 Joanna Briscoe could save herself all the anguish and hypocrisy (More tea, Vicar? G2, April 11) by sending her offspring to the local comprehensive, just as my parents did. I'm sure that while there, her child will receive a quality education from hard-working and dedicated teachers, as well as a fine array of social skills to enable junior to avoid the \"head-butting ... round the corner\". I'd like to thank Manchester's schools for my 10 GCSEs, 38 points at A-level and soon-to-be-had degree in medicine and surgery. Relax, Joanna, don't move house, don't prostitute yourself at the altar. The kid will do fine. Bill Gibson Leeds bill_gibson@mail.com \u0095 I understand Joanna Briscoe's dilemma, but I would ask her not to place her fraudulent bum on my pews. Almost certainly, her local community school is much, much better than its reputation. I have chaired the governing bodies of two adjacent schools, one C of E, one community, for 11 years. Although the schools were quite different, the commitment and teaching skills of the staff were very similar and I felt very happy in both. If there is a problem, far better would be to work with others to help the community school improve. Rev Neil Richardson Greenford, Middx \u0095 In view of the social divisiveness of the education system in this country, is it not time for you to require all your contributors publicly to register where they send their children to school and whether these schools are private or state, religious or non-religious?

      "trailText": "<p><strong>James M Cain</strong>'s hard-boiled novels of greed, lust\nand murder made for perfect film noir. But, says\nWilliam Preston Robertson, the writer's\nrelationship with Hollywood's 'cavemen' was\nnever easy </p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>James M Cain, the prolific and talented author of such landmark hard-boiled novels as The Postman Always Rings Twice, Double Indemnity, Mildred Pierce and Serenade, had nothing but contempt for movies and for the bloated industry that produced them. Cain believed movies to be an inferior art form. He found them crudely schematic, childishly contrived, simple-minded, superficial and unsophisticated - the modern equivalent of hunting tableaux scrawled by slavering, torch-bearing cavemen. </p> <p>That Cain held the flickering arts in such disdain is ironic because he eagerly pursued a career as a screenwriter in his youth and later on, as a novelist, garnered respectable riches from the film rights to his work. Today, much of the public is aware of him solely through the movies derived from his books. When people think of James Mallahan Cain, they think of Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck in Double Indemnity. They think of John Garfield and Lana Turner in The Postman Always Rings Twice. They think of Joan Crawford in Mildred Pierce, re-released this week. When people think of Cain, they think of film noir. </p> <p>And why not? The Postman Always Rings Twice and Double Indemnity, Cain's back-to-back 1930s pulp masterpieces of adultery, spousal homicide and insurance-settlement high jinks - once they were allowed on to the screen by the Hays Office censors of the 1940s - became veritable templates for a staggering number of noir movies. This use, or perhaps overuse, of the \"Cain template\" extended well past the original film noir era's demise in the 1950s. The practice re-emerged in the neo-noir era of the 1980s and 1990s, which arguably began with Body Heat and Blood Simple. From there it was carried across the millennial threshold into the current era, when \"in the tradition of James M Cain\" is shamelessly proclaimed on the sleeve of every direct-to-video thriller that, however slightly, incorporates blue lighting, a fog machine and a hero with a nicotine addiction. </p> <p>And herein lies the problem. When all is said and done, very few films of any era bear a resemblance to the spirit of Cain's writing, the best of which was penned long before film noir existed. Somewhere in the shadows of film noir, James M Cain the writer has got lost. No one would rate Cain a Nobel-worthy man of letters - except maybe Albert Camus, who admitted basing his existentialist work The Outsider on the Cain template. Nevertheless, at the very least Cain deserves a seat alongside the other major fiction-writers of his day. He deserves to be taken seriously, not as some kind of a miner hammering out rough ore for the Hollywood refinery, but for what he was: a first-rate writer of fiction. </p> <p>Cain belonged to that gaggle of writers from the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s known as the \"tough guy\" or \"hard boiled\" school. They wrote terse, lurid, violent tales about crime and desperation, set against low-rent landscapes populated with lumpenproletarians and anti-heroes who jabbered in the clipped, slangy lingo of the everyday schmo. Some of these writers, such as Dashiell Hammett (The Maltese Falcon, Red Harvest) and Raymond Chandler (The Big Sleep, Farewell My Lovely), wrote detective stories. Others, such as Horace McCoy (They Shoot Horses, Don't They?, Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye) and Cain, tended to approach matters from the point of view of those who committed the crimes. Critic Edmund Wilson dubbed the writers in this latter subset \"the poets of the tabloid murder\" and, of them, he considered Cain the best. </p> <p>James M Cain described himself as an ugly, Irish Catholic mama's boy born in Maryland to upper-middle-class parents, in 1892. Cain's mother was a former soprano who gave up her career to marry Cain's father, a self-centred academic who drank and disliked work. Both parents had an annoying penchant for punctiliously correcting Cain's grammar in conversation, a habit that no doubt helped shape his love of jargon-laden first-person narrative voices, and compelled him later to cite as his major literary influence a bricklayer named Ike. </p> <p>Writing was a kind of booby prize to Cain. Tubercular and deeply sensitive, with a tendency toward self-deprecation, he struggled to find his niche in life, trying his hand at everything from opera to insurance. He failed as a novelist, too, until he wrote The Postman Always Rings Twice, which initially he wanted to call Bar-B-Que. Thankfully, this time around, failure lost out. Cain's experiences with failure instilled in him an affinity for losers as his protagonists. Cain's characters are society's lost souls, the disenfranchised and the powerless, inches away from despair, craving to make something of themselves and willing to try any idea to reach that end, no matter how stupid or murderous. The jargon he got from Ike. The morbid fascination with tortuous moral dilemmas, from his Catholic upbringing. The rough sexual encounters seem to have been his own idea. </p> <p>Cain's interest in losers wasn't sheer perversity. As bleak and depressing as his fictional world could be at times, Cain portrayed his losers with great humanity, complexity and artistic integrity. Losers and weaklings, psychopaths and sociopaths though they may be, Cain's characters are individual human beings compassionately rendered. Perhaps most human of all Cain's stable of flawed, self- destructive characters is Mildred Pierce. Mildred is an ordinary, middle-class, Depression-era housewife with pretty nice gams, a talent for making pies and a healthy libido, whose confining socio-economic position has left her with few resources to fall back upon except her gams, her pies and her libido. </p> <p>Surrounded as she is by extraordinarily ineffectual men with diminished senses of responsibility, and motivated by her desire to make things better for her cruelly snobbish, sociopathic daughter Veda, Mildred scrappily builds a minor culinary empire, basking in her sexual freedom along the way. Her downfall is her unhealthy, self-destructive love for the loveless, insatiable, ungrateful Veda. </p> <p>Cain's highly sexual, psychologically and physically violent novels caused a sensation on their release but were not brought to the screen until the end of the second world war and the rise of film noir. By then Cain had given up on Hollywood and had left California for the pastoral confines of Maryland with his wife, an opera singer. And film noir was left to its own devices with Cain's work. </p> <p>Film noir was born from the serendipitous jumbling of a series of unlikely influences, both artistic and thematic in nature. The stories were primarily American crime dramas whose cinematic look was heavily influenced in lighting, framing and mood by the ostentatious, off-kilter angst of German Expressionism, courtesy of the many directors who had fled the Nazis. Subtextually added to this mix were a variety of US government-sanctioned, propagandistic impulses of the day: the drive to disengage women from their independent work status in the total war economy; the housing lobby's promotion of urban flight to the cheap suburban developments that were springing up; and the campaign to discourage returning soldiers from wartime habits and motivate them to settle back into domestic life. </p> <p>But film noir is also a stylised form, a kind of Teutonically lit Noh drama of fedoras and slinky dresses in which the characters are pawns of fate and destiny, with personalities defined by broadly sketched impulses of lust, greed, paranoia and evil. Cain was many things, but self- consciously stylistic he was not. He relied on his rhythmic sense of dialogue and his understanding of human psychology and social context to tell his tales. </p> <p>So it was that when film noir took on the job of adapting Cain's novels, the distinctly 1930s aspects were removed from his yarns of sex and murder and manipulative, castrating temptresses. The result was that Cain's strong but flawed women lost whatever individual motivating traits they exhibited in the books and became pointlessly manipulative. </p> <p>Thus Cora Papadakis in The Postman Always Rings Twice became Cora Smith, a dapper beauty without the desperation that helped explain her motivations in Cain's book. Phyllis Nirdlinger in Double Indemnity became Phyllis Dietrichson, a pointlessly evil woman. And finally, for the movie of Mildred Pierce, the characters of the men were bolstered. Many of them got jobs or financial interests that had been missing in the book, while Veda's operatic talents were reduced to those of a nightclub songstress. And the class-struggle aspects were for the most part excised, leaving no drudgework for Mildred to partake in. The book, of course, had no murder, but since this was Cain, it seemed only right to add one. </p> <p>It's important, and only fair to Cain, to remember the distinction between the literary demands of the 1930s and the cinematic demands of the 1940s. In his excellent book analysing the work of Cain, Paul Skenazy compares Cain's portrayal of Depression-era desperation to Nathanael West's The Day of the Locust and John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath. If nothing else, Cain deserves to be taken seriously for his legitimate contribution to American literature. And to French literature too, if you count Camus.</p>",

      "bodyText": "James M Cain, the prolific and talented author of such landmark hard-boiled novels as The Postman Always Rings Twice, Double Indemnity, Mildred Pierce and Serenade, had nothing but contempt for movies and for the bloated industry that produced them. Cain believed movies to be an inferior art form. He found them crudely schematic, childishly contrived, simple-minded, superficial and unsophisticated - the modern equivalent of hunting tableaux scrawled by slavering, torch-bearing cavemen. That Cain held the flickering arts in such disdain is ironic because he eagerly pursued a career as a screenwriter in his youth and later on, as a novelist, garnered respectable riches from the film rights to his work. Today, much of the public is aware of him solely through the movies derived from his books. When people think of James Mallahan Cain, they think of Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck in Double Indemnity. They think of John Garfield and Lana Turner in The Postman Always Rings Twice. They think of Joan Crawford in Mildred Pierce, re-released this week. When people think of Cain, they think of film noir. And why not? The Postman Always Rings Twice and Double Indemnity, Cain's back-to-back 1930s pulp masterpieces of adultery, spousal homicide and insurance-settlement high jinks - once they were allowed on to the screen by the Hays Office censors of the 1940s - became veritable templates for a staggering number of noir movies. This use, or perhaps overuse, of the \"Cain template\" extended well past the original film noir era's demise in the 1950s. The practice re-emerged in the neo-noir era of the 1980s and 1990s, which arguably began with Body Heat and Blood Simple. From there it was carried across the millennial threshold into the current era, when \"in the tradition of James M Cain\" is shamelessly proclaimed on the sleeve of every direct-to-video thriller that, however slightly, incorporates blue lighting, a fog machine and a hero with a nicotine addiction. And herein lies the problem. When all is said and done, very few films of any era bear a resemblance to the spirit of Cain's writing, the best of which was penned long before film noir existed. Somewhere in the shadows of film noir, James M Cain the writer has got lost. No one would rate Cain a Nobel-worthy man of letters - except maybe Albert Camus, who admitted basing his existentialist work The Outsider on the Cain template. Nevertheless, at the very least Cain deserves a seat alongside the other major fiction-writers of his day. He deserves to be taken seriously, not as some kind of a miner hammering out rough ore for the Hollywood refinery, but for what he was: a first-rate writer of fiction. Cain belonged to that gaggle of writers from the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s known as the \"tough guy\" or \"hard boiled\" school. They wrote terse, lurid, violent tales about crime and desperation, set against low-rent landscapes populated with lumpenproletarians and anti-heroes who jabbered in the clipped, slangy lingo of the everyday schmo. Some of these writers, such as Dashiell Hammett (The Maltese Falcon, Red Harvest) and Raymond Chandler (The Big Sleep, Farewell My Lovely), wrote detective stories. Others, such as Horace McCoy (They Shoot Horses, Don't They?, Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye) and Cain, tended to approach matters from the point of view of those who committed the crimes. Critic Edmund Wilson dubbed the writers in this latter subset \"the poets of the tabloid murder\" and, of them, he considered Cain the best. James M Cain described himself as an ugly, Irish Catholic mama's boy born in Maryland to upper-middle-class parents, in 1892. Cain's mother was a former soprano who gave up her career to marry Cain's father, a self-centred academic who drank and disliked work. Both parents had an annoying penchant for punctiliously correcting Cain's grammar in conversation, a habit that no doubt helped shape his love of jargon-laden first-person narrative voices, and compelled him later to cite as his major literary influence a bricklayer named Ike. Writing was a kind of booby prize to Cain. Tubercular and deeply sensitive, with a tendency toward self-deprecation, he struggled to find his niche in life, trying his hand at everything from opera to insurance. He failed as a novelist, too, until he wrote The Postman Always Rings Twice, which initially he wanted to call Bar-B-Que. Thankfully, this time around, failure lost out. Cain's experiences with failure instilled in him an affinity for losers as his protagonists. Cain's characters are society's lost souls, the disenfranchised and the powerless, inches away from despair, craving to make something of themselves and willing to try any idea to reach that end, no matter how stupid or murderous. The jargon he got from Ike. The morbid fascination with tortuous moral dilemmas, from his Catholic upbringing. The rough sexual encounters seem to have been his own idea. Cain's interest in losers wasn't sheer perversity. As bleak and depressing as his fictional world could be at times, Cain portrayed his losers with great humanity, complexity and artistic integrity. Losers and weaklings, psychopaths and sociopaths though they may be, Cain's characters are individual human beings compassionately rendered. Perhaps most human of all Cain's stable of flawed, self- destructive characters is Mildred Pierce. Mildred is an ordinary, middle-class, Depression-era housewife with pretty nice gams, a talent for making pies and a healthy libido, whose confining socio-economic position has left her with few resources to fall back upon except her gams, her pies and her libido. Surrounded as she is by extraordinarily ineffectual men with diminished senses of responsibility, and motivated by her desire to make things better for her cruelly snobbish, sociopathic daughter Veda, Mildred scrappily builds a minor culinary empire, basking in her sexual freedom along the way. Her downfall is her unhealthy, self-destructive love for the loveless, insatiable, ungrateful Veda. Cain's highly sexual, psychologically and physically violent novels caused a sensation on their release but were not brought to the screen until the end of the second world war and the rise of film noir. By then Cain had given up on Hollywood and had left California for the pastoral confines of Maryland with his wife, an opera singer. And film noir was left to its own devices with Cain's work.

It might happen off camera, but it's one of the film's raunchier, chancier, more grubbily English things, superciliously ignored in the acres of consumer-style journalism devoted to all things Bridget in the past few weeks. </p> <p>Sharon Maguire's broadly enjoyable, knockabout, sitcommy picture takes the sophisticated creation of Helen Fielding and - well, doesn't dumb it down exactly, but transfers it to a medium in which much of her distinctive qualities are inevitably lost. What we've got isn't so much postmodern Pride and Prejudice as pre-modern Mills and Boon. </p> <p>Bridget, the screwed-up publishing assistant, played by the Texan Ren\u00e9e Zellweger, is torn between the adorably sexy cad Daniel, played by Hugh Grant, and the sullen but morally superior human rights barrister Mark Darcy - or perhaps that should be plain Mr Darcy, played by Colin Firth. Who should she choose? (The answer, frankly, is Hugh, who blows everyone else off the screen with a cracking performance as the naughtier-than-thou heartbreaker. Of this, more in a moment.) </p> <p>We all know how Bridget Jones has been the template for the jokey single-gal confessionalists in fact and fiction. How Bridget famously spawned a billion imitators in books and newspapers, who get daringly drunk and are \"rubbish\" and \"sad\" about men and everything else. But really we know that they are in control by virtue of writing it up themselves, very wittily, and having a prestigious columnist job. Putting their great ancestor Bridge on the screen, however, abolishes this contract of understanding between writer and reader. When we see Bridget drink her bodyweight in chardonnay, fall over, get up and make a funny face, it isn't being filtered through her own prose. </p> <p>In print, we were laughing with Bridget. On screen, well... The awful truth about this film is that it makes Bridget look like the world's biggest prat, and an egregious emotional imbecile. And the camera's glimpses of her own diary disclose not the devastatingly acute document we have come to know and love, but crass, sub-Adrian Mole, semi-literate jottings with big girly handwriting. </p> <p>So Bridget has to be reimagined as a lovable, infantile clown - but once this leap has been made, Ren\u00e9e Zellweger's impersonation of Bridget is entertaining. She has an excellent English accent, the best since Gwyneth Paltrow's Emma. And her Jake La Motta-ish weight-gain is a thing of joy. Her cheeks have become plump, hamster-ish, pushing her mouth into a continuous, unsexy pout of anxiety and self-reproach. Her thighs are massively dimpled and her great bottom is as stately as a sinking galleon, and it's always in our face, particularly when Bridget wears a bulging Playboy bunny outfit to her mother's vicars and tarts party. It is a quintessentially English bottom which should by rights be encased in an unflattering netball skirt. </p> <p>We don't get much about her mates, Shazzer and Jude - a bit of a waste of two first-class actors, Shirley Henderson and Sally Phillips (much of their stuff was presumably lost in the edit). Colin Firth reprises his smouldering act as Mr Darcy, although oddly it's Hugh who gets dripping wet this time, drunkenly falling out of the rowing boat he and Bridget have hired on a romantic weekend break. The big comic set-piece comes when Daniel and Darcy, consumed with mutual loathing, have a punch-up out in the street, and Bridget's gay friend Tom (James Callis) blunders into a restaurant queenily to announce the exciting fact: \"Fight! Fight!\" </p> <p>As I have said, any red-blooded member of the audience will be longing for Hugh to win it. He is effortlessly the best thing in the film. His Daniel is, as they say, Not Safe In Taxis or anywhere else. There is nothing floppy or limp about his hair here; it is flowing and Byronically sensual. Daniel is mad, bad, dangerous and extremely funny to know. And he's much more interesting than dull old Darcy or indeed silly old Bridget. What a pair they are. A stuffy bore and an emotionally needy, not-very-talented person whose one professional success, as a television presenter, is the gift of Darcy in the first place. </p> <p>Richard Curtis's London, swirling with picturesque snow, is that weird imaginary place, that ersatz London-from-another-planet we saw in Notting Hill. It's an unreal London where barristers can smash up restaurants without getting into trouble with the police or the Bar Council. It's a virtual-reality zone where Bridget organises a publishing party attended by Salman Rushdie and other self-conscious literary celebs playing wooden cameos of themselves - a very uncertain moment, in which the film appears to be absorbing its own status as a media event. </p> <p>But this is a strong debut from former documentary-maker Sharon Maguire, who directs with chutzpah and style. Richard Curtis's script (taken from original drafts by Helen Fielding and Andrew Davies) may not be as sharp as Four Weddings or Notting Hill, but it has its moments, including a tremendous gag about, of all people, FR Leavis. It reminded me of Leavis's comment about Edith Sitwell: she belongs to the history of publicity, not literature. The same could be said of that one-woman hype sensation Bridget Jones.

That captures the album perfectly. Acoustic Soul is rooted in the natural, with Denver-born Arie following the path recently beaten by label-mate Erykah Badu. The single Video is the manifesto: a swaggering, witty attack on her big-city R&amp;B cousins fixated by \"bling bling\" and the music biz in general. \"Keep your Cristal and your pistol,\" she opines in a resonant, oaky voice, before sniggering: \"Keep your silicon, I like my own.\" And to prove the country girl with the guitar can match her 'hood-dwelling sistas for erotica, Brown Skin seethes with desire, especially when offering \"Hershey kisses to your liquorice\". Arie doesn't shun hip-hop's innovations altogether: I See God in You and Simple are expert appropriations of rap's beat science. Like Badu, Jill Scott and other nu-soul practitioners, Arie brings the focused power of a songsmith who served her apprenticeship in a coffee shop before the call came from a music-biz suit.

(MO) </p> <p><strong> The Avalanches </strong> Since I Left You <br>(XL) **** <br> \u00a311.99<br> </p> <p> There's a hint of the Little Englander about British clubbers. They believe our DJs, clubs and dance producers are the world's finest. Americans invented house, techno and garage, yet British DJs claim to \"educate\" American audiences. In reality, foreign dance producers lead the way: Parisians Daft Punk redefined house; Dutch and German trance dominates the charts. Now it's Australia's turn: the debut of Melbourne sextet the Avalanches is the freshest dance album in years. Despite a painstaking construction process - it's essentially hundreds of samples stitched together, the crackle of ancient records audible throughout - Since I Left You's breakbeat funk sounds deliciously breezy and sunkissed. Tracks come laden with pop hooks, dancefloor nous and a cheery disinterest in borrowing from fashionable sources. Stay Another Season pinches its bassline from Madonna's Holiday, but Close to You is powered by steals from 1980s monstrosities Kid Creole and the Coconuts. Both work perfectly, as does the rest of this glorious, varied album. British producers should take notes. (AP) </p> <p><strong> Various Artists </strong> Bridget Jones's Diary OST <br>(Mercury) *** <br> \u00a314.99<br> </p> <p> Put out a call for soundtrack material for a high-profile Britflick and watch big pop names come flocking with new songs. Robbie Williams, Geri Halliwell, Gabrielle and Sheryl Crow recorded tracks exclusively for this album. (The other tunes, such as Aretha Franklin's Respect, are predictable romantic-comedy spacefillers.) Backed by a big band, the Robster bravely attacks the Rodgers and Hart standard Have You Met Miss Jones?, leering as trumpets swell climactically. If he stuck with it, there would be no more need for Harry Connick Jr. The other Williams contribution, Not of This Earth, is arguably the worst song of his career. Halliwell's cover of the Weather Girls's unsurpassable It's Raining Men bubbles with campness, which is as nothing against the fact that she can't sing. Undoubtedly this is all more amusing accompanied by images of Bridget reeling with the horror of having soared to nine stone. (CS) </p> <p><strong> Emma Bunton </strong> A Girl Like Me <br>(Virgin) ** <br> \u00a314.99<br> </p> <p> Where's the law that says every Spice Girl has to make a solo album? This debut from Normal Spice might be passably interesting if Emma Bunton weren't so bent on being Miss Low Expectations. But even the song titles - Take My Breath Away, High on Love - are quintessentially average. One doesn't expect her to bleed for her art, but is a bit of pluck too much to ask? Bunton's girlishly mediocre voice is poorly served by a dozen flavourless McSongs, written by the expensive likes of Rodney Jerkins, producer of the last Spice LP. The Edie Brickell cover What I Am reached number two in 1999. That's all you need to know. (CS) </p> <p><strong> Various Artists </strong> Brand New Boots and Panties <br>(east central one records) **** <br> \u00a313.99<br> </p> <p> Ian Dury was one of the finest lyricists that British pop has ever produced. It's nearly a quarter of a century now since he and the Blockheads recorded their classic debut, New Boots and Panties, and this reworking of the album shows just how triumphantly the songs have survived. There are few love songs quite as cheerfully explicit as Wake Up and Make Love With Me, bravely tackled here by Sinead O'Connor, but without Dury's sense of wicked, sexual delight. And there are few parental tributes quite as jolly, tender, and sad as My Old Man, finely performed here by Madness, who manage to keep all those different emotions in play. His gentle, then suddenly frantic tribute to Sweet Gene Vincent is covered here by the laddish Robbie Williams. Essex boy Billy Bragg may have been the obvious choice to retell the sexual adventures of Billericay Dickie, but there's an unexpected musical twist, as his band, the Blokes, bring the song a new eastern flavour. Dury's own old band, the Blockheads, provide the backing for the majority of these songs and remain in fine and funky form. A great album: check it out, and then go back and listen to the original. (RD) </p> <p><strong> Lupine Howl </strong> The Carnivorous Lunar Activities of Lupine Howl <br>(Vinyl Hiss) ** <br> \u00a311.99<br> </p> <p> Following their dismissal from Spiritualized, bassist Sean Cook, guitarist Mike Mooney and on-off drummer Damon Reece became Lupine Howl. Their only musical connection with Spiritualized is a ceaselessly narcotic air. Mostly they take the blue-collar, blues-rock feel of Reef and add a few Pierce-style effects. That it doesn't quite work is not wholly down to their vaulting ambition, nor a drug-obsessed lyrical slackness that would have done the Cult proud. It's more a result of Lupine Howl being essentially backing musicians on whom the spotlight does not shine especially kindly, despite Mooney's always inventive way with the guitar. Even the better songs, such as the wrigglesome Sometimes and the almost symphonic Planet X, fall down when Cook begins to sing. A shame, but some things are just not meant to be. (JA) </p> <p><strong> Syd Barrett </strong> Wouldn't You Miss Me? The Best Of <br>(EMI/Harvest) ** <br> \u00a314.99<br> </p> <p> Syd Barrett is the archetype of unhinged English psychedelia, the man whose freakish imagination launched Pink Floyd's early success before he went famously bonkers. This 22-track compilation has been assembled from Barrett's solo albums, The Madcap Laughs and Barrett, with a scattering from the \"rarities\" album, Opel. Completists will wriggle with delight at the inclusion of the long-lost Bob Dylan Blues, which sounds like Donovan. Unfortunately, minus Syd's Floydian classics, See Emily Play and Arnold Layne, Barrett-world is a perplexing shambles of nonsense verse, buskerish acoustic guitars and berserk multitrack vocals, where no two chords fit together and songs never end, merely stop. Perhaps you had to be there. (AS)</p>",

Bunton's girlishly mediocre voice is poorly served by a dozen flavourless McSongs, written by the expensive likes of Rodney Jerkins, producer of the last Spice LP. The Edie Brickell cover What I Am reached number two in 1999. That's all you need to know. (CS) Various Artists Brand New Boots and Panties (east central one records) **** \u00a313.99 Ian Dury was one of the finest lyricists that British pop has ever produced. It's nearly a quarter of a century now since he and the Blockheads recorded their classic debut, New Boots and Panties, and this reworking of the album shows just how triumphantly the songs have survived. There are few love songs quite as cheerfully explicit as Wake Up and Make Love With Me, bravely tackled here by Sinead O'Connor, but without Dury's sense of wicked, sexual delight. And there are few parental tributes quite as jolly, tender, and sad as My Old Man, finely performed here by Madness, who manage to keep all those different emotions in play. His gentle, then suddenly frantic tribute to Sweet Gene Vincent is covered here by the laddish Robbie Williams. Essex boy Billy Bragg may have been the obvious choice to retell the sexual adventures of Billericay Dickie, but there's an unexpected musical twist, as his band, the Blokes, bring the song a new eastern flavour. Dury's own old band, the Blockheads, provide the backing for the majority of these songs and remain in fine and funky form. A great album: check it out, and then go back and listen to the original. (RD) Lupine Howl The Carnivorous Lunar Activities of Lupine Howl (Vinyl Hiss) ** \u00a311.99 Following their dismissal from Spiritualized, bassist Sean Cook, guitarist Mike Mooney and on-off drummer Damon Reece became Lupine Howl. Their only musical connection with Spiritualized is a ceaselessly narcotic air. Mostly they take the blue-collar, blues-rock feel of Reef and add a few Pierce-style effects. That it doesn't quite work is not wholly down to their vaulting ambition, nor a drug-obsessed lyrical slackness that would have done the Cult proud. It's more a result of Lupine Howl being essentially backing musicians on whom the spotlight does not shine especially kindly, despite Mooney's always inventive way with the guitar. Even the better songs, such as the wrigglesome Sometimes and the almost symphonic Planet X, fall down when Cook begins to sing. A shame, but some things are just not meant to be. (JA) Syd Barrett Wouldn't You Miss Me? The Best Of (EMI/Harvest) ** \u00a314.99 Syd Barrett is the archetype of unhinged English psychedelia, the man whose freakish imagination launched Pink Floyd's early success before he went famously bonkers. This 22-track compilation has been assembled from Barrett's solo albums, The Madcap Laughs and Barrett, with a scattering from the \"rarities\" album, Opel. Completists will wriggle with delight at the inclusion of the long-lost Bob Dylan Blues, which sounds like Donovan. Unfortunately, minus Syd's Floydian classics, See Emily Play and Arnold Layne, Barrett-world is a perplexing shambles of nonsense verse, buskerish acoustic guitars and berserk multitrack vocals, where no two chords fit together and songs never end, merely stop. Perhaps you had to be there. (AS)",

It doesn't get much better than this. Frisell is a wonderfully talented and skilled jazz guitarist, but his appeal goes deeper and wider than mere jazz brilliance. His tone infiltrates the environment and catches your ear; it's a sound that can contain good humour, or melancholy, or nostalgia, yet still be utterly fresh and un-cliched, and it's unquestionably an adult taste: complex, rich, full of layers. Even when he plays the simplest of tunes, such as Pretty Flowers Were Made for Blooming or Where Do We Go?, the touch and timbre adds a dimension of experience and authority that few musicians deliver with such consistency. </p> <p>Blues Dream is a suite of pieces for seven-piece band originally commissioned for the unerringly hip Walker Art Centre in Minneapolis. Most of the musicians have played with Frisell at different times in his career, but it's the first time he's used this particular line-up. The back line comprises double bassist David Piltch and Sex Mob drummer Kenny Wollesen (who accompanied Frisell in his recent UK appearance during the London Jazz Festival). At the front is steel guitarist Greg Leisz plus three horns: trumpeter Ron Miles, trombonist Curtis Fowlkes (who both played on Frisell's innovative Quartet album) and saxophonist Billy Drewes. The reunion element give Blues Dream a slight feeling of a retrospective, though the material is all new, and all Frisell's. There's a hint of his witty and empathetic music for silent Buster Keaton comedies such as The High Sign and Go West, which used his trio with Kermit Driscoll and drummer Joey Baron to such good effect. Wollesen has something of Baron's hyperactive attention to detail, but on numbers such as Where Do We Go? and Outlaws he and Piltch seem just as happy generating a groove so spacious you could drive a pick-up truck between its snare beats. </p> <p>Frisell's way of voicing the front line is as unconventional and logical as his guitar playing - so odd and off-kilter that you couldn't imagine it any other way. Listen to the opening of Greg Leisz (Frisell, like Miles Davis and Carla Bley, has a habit of giving songs the names of real people, from Jimmy Carter to Ron Carter). The horns blend in a kind of Mingus-meets-Stax manner that means you can hear individual sounds quite clearly within a blurry ensemble. </p> <p>Ron Miles, a distinctive trumpet player who has made a couple of strong albums under his own name, takes the lead in the two versions of the title track and the horns-only Fifty Years. Jazz Passenger Fowlkes shines in Soul Merchant and Drewes wails decoratively on Pretty Flowers.

And at other times they settle down to play the blues, as on Things Will Never Be the Same. In case things get a little too normal, Frisell can always be relied upon to weird things up again by throwing in a few guitar loops - atonal, asynchronous and completely A-OK.</p>",

But as this electrifying live recording proves, he certainly made sure that the New York audience realised what they had been missing, with playing of inexorable power and lyrical poise. </p> <p>The published programme takes up the first of the two discs - Busoni's arrangement of the Chaconne from Bach's D minor violin Partita, Beethoven's C minor Piano Sonata Op 111, and the four Chopin Scherzos. The second (included as a free extra) takes care of the five encores: there is a Scriabin poem, a Scarlatti sonata, one each of Rachmaninov's Etudes Tableaux and Moskowski's studies, while an incandescent account of Balakirev's Islamey, one of the most technically demanding works in the piano repertory, really brings the house down right at the end. </p> <p>Some of the same works were included in Pletnev's London recital at the Barbican three weeks after this recording was made: that was glorious enough, but the playing here, especially in the Chopin Scherzos, seems even finer, and more dramatically focused. The Bach/Busoni and Beethoven (both missing from the London programme) are totally absorbing. The Chaconne is wonderfully athletic, full of glinting sonorities, while Op 111 is a study in contrasts, between sharply honed dramatic impulsion and almost motionless textural exploration. Everything seems freshly thought, and even when the ideas do not quite gel - some of the variations in the finale are rather brutally juxtaposed, though the trills of the coda are breathtaking - they are provoking, and genuinely inspired. </p> <p>In the Scherzos, though, not a single note is misplaced. Pletnev has such sovereign command of the keyboard that the technical challenges hold no terrors for him, and he has such an instinctive grasp of the musical architecture that even when he takes off on discursive explorations of what are really incidental details, his sense of shape and purpose never falters. He makes the listener hang on his every phrase, for the sheer delight of what he will do with it, in the full knowledge that all the threads will be tied together in the blistering codas that end each piece. It is fabulous piano playing. </p> <p><strong> Hartmann: String Quartet No 1; Bartok: String Quartet No 4 </strong> Zehetmair Quartet<br> (ECM) **** <br> \u00a314.99<br> </p> <p> Founded only a few years ago, the Zehetmair quartet, led by the outstanding violinist Thomas Zehetmair, is already among the finest ensembles around. They boast technical confidence, expressive freedom and a complete understanding of each work's idiom. Amadeus Hartmann's First Quartet (1933) is the rarity here - dark and brooding, and clearly indebted to Bartok. The performance is so persuasive that it is a shame it is not coupled with his Second, completed after the second world war. While the Bartok playing here is equally masterly, there are already several other equally fine CD versions of the Fourth Quartet, but few of Hartmann's Second. </p> <p><strong> Bruckner: Symphony No 8</strong> Berlin Philharmonic/ Harnoncourt<br> (Teldec, 2 CDs) **** <br> \u00a314.99<br> </p> <p> Nikolaus Harnoncourt's fourth Bruckner disc (after the Third and Fourth Symphonies with the Royal Concertgebouw and the Seventh with the Vienna Philharmonic) was recorded live in Berlin and is as magnificent as its predecessors. It is still hard to pin down exactly what kind of Bruckner conductor he is - certainly not one of the monumental school, who conceives each symphony in stark tectonic blocks, nor quite one of the great interventionists, moulding every phrase with self-conscious expressiveness. That is not to imply that his approach neglects the longer-range issues in the Eighth - on the contrary, his command of the structural processes is totally convincing - nor that he is insensitive to the smaller-scale issues. Rather, he conceives the music as an organic whole, with each great paragraph emerging naturally from its predecessor. </p> <p><strong> Boccherini: String Quintets </strong> Europa Galante <br>(Virgin) *** <br> \u00a314.99<br> </p> <p> Unlike his younger contemporary, Mozart, Boccherini wrote string quintets for a group including two cellos rather than two violas - the combination adopted by Schubert for his great C major Quintet almost half a century later. The three works here from his Op 25 (nos 1, 4 and 6), stylishly and persuasively played by the violinist Fabio Bondi and members of his period-instrument ensemble Europa Galante, were composed in the 1770s, when Boccherini was court composer to the Spanish Infante, son of Charles III. Sometimes the group paint the expressive glosses just a little too thickly, with a hint of mannerism, but by and large it is easy to enjoy and easy to admire. </p> <p><strong> Bach: Easter Oratorio; Magnificat </strong> Gabriel Consort &amp; Players/McCreesh Archiv 469 531-2<br> *** <br> \u00a314.99<br> </p> <p> These performances of Bach's Easter Oratorio and Magnificat make no attempt at historical reconstruction, or to place the works in a liturgical context. They are \"studio\" interpretations, recorded in a baroque church in Saxony, whose fine-sounding organ makes its presence felt in the cantata-like oratorio. Allotting one voice to a part in the choruses, Paul McCreesh is vividly extrovert, never meekly devotional; he has a fine team of singers, with the tenor Paul Agnew's contributions to the Easter Oratorio especially noteworthy, and his tempi vary from the wonderingly gentle to the brassily assertive. The Magnificat sets off at a tremendous pace that is not quite sustained, though there are some gloriously effective moments.</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong> Sibelius: Kullervo </strong><br> Paasikivi/Laukka/Helsinki University Chorus/Lahti Symphony/Vanska<br> (BIS) ***** <br> \u00a312.99<br> </p> <p> It is hard to believe that it is only 25 years since the very first recording of Sibelius's Kullervo appeared on record. That account, conducted by Paavo Berglund, still stands up well against its subsequent rivals, and revealed the glories of this early work, first performed in 1892. In his first large-scale orchestral score, Sibelius discharged his debts to Wagner and prepared the ground for the numbered series of symphonies that were to follow, taking him on a unique creative path. </p> <p>Though Sibelius never publicly disowned the work in his later life, and even made arrangements of some sections of it for special occasions, he certainly did not go out of his way to encourage performances, and it was not until after his death in 1957 that the work began to be heard again. The first performance in the 20th century took place nine months after the composer's death, and began the process of rehabilitation; there are now nine recorded versions of Kullervo, and certainly a complete cycle of the Sibelius symphonies is unthinkable without it. Now Osmo Vanska crowns what is the finest versions of the symphonies in our time with an equally definitive account of this fascinating near-masterpiece. </p> <p>Whether or not Kullervo should be classified as a symphony at all is another matter: at the time of the premiere it was called a \"symphonic poem for soloists, chorus and orchestra\", though the score itself contains no label at all, and the composer certainly referred to it as a symphony, despite the programmatic titles of each of the five movements, the vividly dramatic choral contributions and the great scena for the mezzo-soprano and baritone soloists that form the central panel. In the genealogy of Sibelius's development, though, it occupies a crucial position. Not only do its formal planning and tightly woven motivic development find their continuation in the architectural coherence of the symphonies, but its programmatic basis in episodes from the Kalevala, the Finnish national epic, led directly to the great series of tone poems, beginning with En Saga two years later, inspired by further episodes from this bundle of legends. </p> <p>But there is one musical seed in Kullervo that was never developed significantly further. The great central confrontation between Kullervo and his sister, with whom he had an incestuous relationship, is unmistakably operatic, and shows how completely Sibelius had taken on board what he had learnt from Wagner, but other than the unsatisfactory one-acter The Maiden in the Tower, written in 1896, Sibelius never wrote a stage work. His instincts took him in a different direction altogether, and the only glimmering of what he might have achieved in his maturity come in the neglected work for soprano and orchestra Luonnotar, which is an operatic scena in all but name. </p> <p>Vanska's performance comprehends all those facets of the work more completely than any other conductor so far. His choice of tempi is sometimes dangerously extreme, especially in the leisurely way he presents the second movement, the purely orchestral Kullervo's Youth, but the quality of the Lahti Symphony Orchestra, who play marvellously for him throughout, is such that it never seems strained. The spaciousness of the introductory Allegro has already defined the scale of what is to follow, and Vanska makes sure that every element of the scheme is crisply defined. The only music that is specifically narrative, the big set-piece scena, has a tingling sense of drama, and the two soloists, Lilli Paasikivi and Raimo Lukka, are not allowed to miss a single inflection in their contributions. </p> <p>From that point on, the tragic trajectory of the work is unstoppable. The fourth movement, Kullervo goes to War, is muscularly martial, and the finale, Kullervo's Death, is at the same time unstintingly doom-laden and uniquely affirmative. Whether it is a symphony or not, Vanska brings the work full circle, as the opening theme is quoted again with total symphonic conviction.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Sibelius: Kullervo Paasikivi/Laukka/Helsinki University Chorus/Lahti Symphony/Vanska (BIS) ***** \u00a312.99 It is hard to believe that it is only 25 years since the very first recording of Sibelius's Kullervo appeared on record. That account, conducted by Paavo Berglund, still stands up well against its subsequent rivals, and revealed the glories of this early work, first performed in 1892. In his first large-scale orchestral score, Sibelius discharged his debts to Wagner and prepared the ground for the numbered series of symphonies that were to follow, taking him on a unique creative path. Though Sibelius never publicly disowned the work in his later life, and even made arrangements of some sections of it for special occasions, he certainly did not go out of his way to encourage performances, and it was not until after his death in 1957 that the work began to be heard again. The first performance in the 20th century took place nine months after the composer's death, and began the process of rehabilitation; there are now nine recorded versions of Kullervo, and certainly a complete cycle of the Sibelius symphonies is unthinkable without it. Now Osmo Vanska crowns what is the finest versions of the symphonies in our time with an equally definitive account of this fascinating near-masterpiece. Whether or not Kullervo should be classified as a symphony at all is another matter: at the time of the premiere it was called a \"symphonic poem for soloists, chorus and orchestra\", though the score itself contains no label at all, and the composer certainly referred to it as a symphony, despite the programmatic titles of each of the five movements, the vividly dramatic choral contributions and the great scena for the mezzo-soprano and baritone soloists that form the central panel. In the genealogy of Sibelius's development, though, it occupies a crucial position. Not only do its formal planning and tightly woven motivic development find their continuation in the architectural coherence of the symphonies, but its programmatic basis in episodes from the Kalevala, the Finnish national epic, led directly to the great series of tone poems, beginning with En Saga two years later, inspired by further episodes from this bundle of legends. But there is one musical seed in Kullervo that was never developed significantly further. The great central confrontation between Kullervo and his sister, with whom he had an incestuous relationship, is unmistakably operatic, and shows how completely Sibelius had taken on board what he had learnt from Wagner, but other than the unsatisfactory one-acter The Maiden in the Tower, written in 1896, Sibelius never wrote a stage work. His instincts took him in a different direction altogether, and the only glimmering of what he might have achieved in his maturity come in the neglected work for soprano and orchestra Luonnotar, which is an operatic scena in all but name. Vanska's performance comprehends all those facets of the work more completely than any other conductor so far. His choice of tempi is sometimes dangerously extreme, especially in the leisurely way he presents the second movement, the purely orchestral Kullervo's Youth, but the quality of the Lahti Symphony Orchestra, who play marvellously for him throughout, is such that it never seems strained. The spaciousness of the introductory Allegro has already defined the scale of what is to follow, and Vanska makes sure that every element of the scheme is crisply defined. The only music that is specifically narrative, the big set-piece scena, has a tingling sense of drama, and the two soloists, Lilli Paasikivi and Raimo Lukka, are not allowed to miss a single inflection in their contributions. From that point on, the tragic trajectory of the work is unstoppable. The fourth movement, Kullervo goes to War, is muscularly martial, and the finale, Kullervo's Death, is at the same time unstintingly doom-laden and uniquely affirmative. Whether it is a symphony or not, Vanska brings the work full circle, as the opening theme is quoted again with total symphonic conviction.",

      "body": "<p><strong> Bill Bruford's Earthworks </strong> The Sound of Surprise<br> (Discipline Global Mobile) **** </p> <p> This is a lively, hugely competent and entertaining set of jazz originals by drummer/ band leader Bruford and his three younger sidekicks. No surprise there, then. In fact they produce a style of British acoustic jazz that's been around for decades, based on fleet, intricate arrangements (either by Bruford alone or in collaboration with the band's pianist Steve Hamilton) that stretch themselves comfortably over swinging grooves, spaced out cadenzas and tricky unisons. Double bass player Mark Hodgson comes across well in the crystal-clear mix: he and Bruford obviously enjoy the car-chase thrills of fast-time playing and know the charts well enough to switch into new sections at a moment's notice. Saxophonist Patrick Clahar has a muscular, Wayne Shorter-ish approach to his front-line tunes and solos (on tenor and soprano) and Hamilton gets plenty of solo space. Yet you can still tell it's a drummer's band - it feels as if Bruford is urging his players to do more, to play more, to take it somewhere else, and I guess we'll have to see them live to see how far they can go. Bruford also upholds the British jazz tradition of terrible punning titles, opening the set with the otherwise fairly cool Revel Without a Pause. </p> <p>I was also delighted to read the fine print on the label, which runs as follows: \"The phonographic copyright in these performances is operated by Discipline Global Mobile on behalf of the artists, with whom it resides, contrary to common practice in the record industry. Discipline Global Mobile accepts no reason for artists to assign the copyright interest in their work to either record company or management by virtue of a 'common practice' which was always questionable, often improper, and is now indefensible.\" The significant thing about this little rant, apart from its obvious parentage in the mind of guitarist and DGM founder Robert Fripp, is that it makes an entirely sensible claim for copyrights - songs and tunes - to remain with their creators rather than treating such rights as flexible assets that can be traded like Pok\u00e9mon cards. </p> <p>DGM's discs have carried this line for a while, an environmentally sound approach in which the business of creativity is seen as a matter of stewardship rather than ownership, but it will be a while before the major media companies catch up with them. </p> <p><strong> WDR Big Band Cologne/Lalo Schifrin </strong> Esperanto <br>(Aleph Records) **** <br> \u00a312.99 <br> </p> <p> Even if you're the sort of cool dude for whom the words \"radio big band\" send unpleasant chills down your spine, you shouldn't dismiss this full-blooded six-part suite by the Argentinian-born composer still best known for the Mission Impossible theme. For a start, the Cologne-based band actually sounds like a real band - they can swing and play all the notes with complete conviction. And thanks to the WDR radio station's adventurous policy of inviting performers and composers for special projects, they have no trouble playing with all manner of individualistic guest musicians. For this disc, on Schifrin's own Aleph label, the basic big band line-up of brass, saxes and rhythm section is augmented by tuba, French Horns (four) and lashings of extra drums and percussion including Gregory Hutchinson, Trilok Gurtu and Sydney Thiam. Schifrin's aim to have soloists from five continents is achieved with the inclusion of US Blue Note star Don Byron (clarinet), James Morrison (trumpet and trombone) from Australia, local boy Simon Stockhausen on saxophone and synthesizer, Zappa alumnus Jean-Luc Ponty on violin and the Argentinian bandoneon player Nestor Marconi. </p> <p>Fans of Schifrin's soundtrack work (such as Dirty Harry, Bullitt and Carlos Saura's Tango) will find plenty to keep them happy, with crisp syncopated ensembles, sizzling brass and flutes, recorded with occasional roughness that reminds us it's all live. But whereas the movie scores are notated, Esperanto demonstrates Schifrin's jazz composer chops. He writes strong ensemble tunes and backgrounds designed to inspire equally melodic responses from his soloists, and makes structures that leave space for improvisation. </p> <p>The title may imply a Utopian quest for a universal language of music, but this is very much an orchestral jazz album, with a striking dramatic flair on tunes such as Resonances and Tango Borealis, and an exuberant mastery of timbre, rhythm and melody reminiscent of his near-contemporary Joe Zawinul. Marconi's elegant and eloquent bandoneon playing is a consistent delight, and everyone sounds as if they're having a good time: evidence that you can write more than 120 movie scores and still come out smiling.</p>",

Last night hundreds of police officers were patrolling the city's empty streets as they struggled to bring an end to some of America's worst urban rioting for a generation. A state of emergency was declared yesterday and the authorities imposed a city-wide curfew after two nights of full-scale rioting followed a police shooting of an unarmed black suspect. There have been 66 arrests so far. \"The violence on our streets is uncontrolled and it runs rampant,\" the mayor, Charles Luken, said. \"The time has come to deal with this seriously.\" The curfew would begin at 8pm (midnight GMT) last night and remain in force until 6am, he said. He and the Ohio state governor, Bob Taft, were discussing whether to bring in the national guard to patrol the city streets. \"Pray for our city,\" Mr Luken added as Black Panther protesters interrupted his press conference at city hall, shouting demands for an end to police brutality. America's latest urban crisis began after a white Cincinnati police officer shot and killed a 19-year-old black man, Timothy Thomas, last Saturday. He was being sought for failing to appear in court on misdemeanour and traffic offence charges. It was the 15th time that the Cincinnati police had shot and killed a black man in the city since 1995, and the fourth such incident since November. Local black leaders said they had repeatedly warned that patience was wearing thin. \"People will rebel if they don't see themselves making progress,\" said the Rev Fred Shuttlesworth, a 79-year-old local civil rights activist who marched with Martin Luther King in the 1960. \"The riots that are happening are the result of Cincinnati not responding and not changing enough.\" Rioting broke out on Tuesday night in the Over-the-Rhine district of the city, where the shooting took place. The disorder spread to several other, mainly black, areas of Cincinnati the next day. The rioters lit fires, threw bricks and looted shops as the violence spiralled. Several outbreaks of gunfire were reported. The police repeatedly fired beanbag pellets into the crowds, which in several areas numbered hundreds. One police officer escaped with his life when a bullet struck his belt buckle during an incident in Over-the-Rhine. That shooting set off a frantic manhunt as police searched for a gunman, described as a black man in his fifties. Police yelled \"you're going to get killed\" at reporters and passers-by who found themselves caught up in the rioting. Widespread looting was reported in the city centre and in the districts of Evanston, Avondale, Walnut Hills and West End on Wednesday night. Further incidents were still being reported as late as 5am yesterday. In another incident, a crowd of black youths who had been throwing stones at passing cars stopped a vehicle driven by a white woman and dragged her into the street, the local press reported. The woman was rescued by local residents after being badly beaten. \"The only issue we are focused on today,\" Mr Luken said yesterday, \"is getting the criminal element off our streets.\"",
