He won his county cap five years later and last season was the leading England-qualified run-scorer in the country with 1,339 at 40.57, with three centuries.

      "body": "<p>Thierry Henry was a bit worried while walking in London recently. A man kept staring at him but said nothing. What made the scene more bizarre to this Frenchman abroad was that the voyeur appeared to be a respectable businessman, dressed in the office uniform of sharp suit and briefcase. </p> <p>\"I thought to myself, 'This guy is strange',\" recalls the softly spoken Henry. It was an impression which did not diminish when the man started undoing the buttons on his shirt. </p> <p>But Henry was even more surprised by what happened next. \"He undid his button and underneath pointed to the Arsenal shirt he was wearing. He didn't even talk to me. He just showed me the shirt and walked off. </p> <p>\"It was incredible because the guy was in a suit with a briefcase. In France some fans don't like to put on the team shirt to see the game.\" </p> <p>Since arriving at Highbury in early August, the man with a touch of Paul Ince in his looks has been adapting to life in his new domain. Not only is the 22-year-old coming to terms with just how close to their hearts the supporters hold Arsenal, but his English and his goalscoring are in a race to see which will become fluent first. </p> <p>At the moment Henry, with six goals in his last seven league games, is doing his talking on the pitch. What makes that statistic so fascinating, however, is that the Thierry Henry bought from Juventus for \u00a310m on a five-year contract six months ago was a winger, good enough to win a French league title with Monaco and a World Cup with France. </p> <p>But Ars\u00e8ne Wenger is a man who forgets nothing. Having seen the teenage Henry advance through the Monaco youth ranks as a striker while coach there, the Arsenal manager decided that his one-time proteg&amp;#'233; would make the ideal replacement for Henry's fellow countryman and friend Nicolas Anelka in the middle of the Gunners attack. </p> <p>On Monday Henry faces the ultimate Premiership test of his new role. With Dennis Bergkamp injured, Davor Suker suspended and Nwankwo Kanu on international duty, the rookie forward is likely to be handed the responsibility of playing lone striker at Manchester United in a game from which Arsenal must take at least a point to retain any meaningful hopes of winning the league title. </p> <p>Wenger may give him a makeshift partner, but either way the weight is on Henry's slender shoulders. Thankfully for Arsenal the test has come at the right time. At the start of the season he would have struggled. </p> <p>\"At the beginning of the season I played the first half against Liverpool as a striker and was very rubbish,\" he says honestly. \"The boss put me on the wing for the second half. But I came on against Southampton as a striker and then played against Derby and that was when everything started to work well.\" </p> <p>It has been a long process reawakening old memories. Henry was a striker for 10 years until he was 17. But there were so many fine goalscorers at Monaco then that, when Wenger left, the new coach played him out wide and he stayed there. </p> <p>\"Ars\u00e8ne Wenger said before he signed me at Arsenal that he wanted me to play as a striker again and I could have said no. But I wanted to play for Arsenal and no one knows me like him, so I said OK. </p> <p>\"He convinced me I would score as a striker because of my pace and there are not so many players to beat to get to goal as there are on the wing. But it has been difficult relearning the role. The most difficult thing was to remember not to come too deep to get the ball. I have to stay nearer the last defender to make the run. </p> <p>\"When you play on the wing you have to come back and you touch the ball more. So in the beginning as a striker I came back because sometimes I wanted to touch the ball more.\" </p> <p>The relearning process included asking defenders what they do not like from strikers. \"I asked Martin Keown and he said making runs behind him. If you come too deep defenders are happy because they can see you. </p> <p>\"So I have to keep that in my mind and remember it all the time. When you play four years on the wing you get used to certain things and when you have to change it's not easy. But now it is more instinctive.\" </p> <p>Henry not only picked Keown's brain but worked after training with Wenger and even studied matches on television to see how strikers moved and which positions they took up. </p> <p>His dedication to the task offers ample evidence of the personal qualities which have always attracted Wenger. The Arsenal manager tried to sign him after the last World Cup but Juventus had first option. Wender was as patient then as he has been with Henry's re-education as a striker, trusting that it would work out in the end. \"He has pace and dribbling power and makes things happen,\" says Wenger. Those qualities have been in ample evidence of late. </p> <p>Henry admits that he has also been forced to learn darker arts since arriving in England. \"Going for high balls I use my elbow or I'm dead. Six months ago I would have been horrified but now I do the same as the others. Sometimes it's just like a game of street football, but the English love that. Three tackles in a row and they're in seventh heaven.\" </p> <p>But he insists he prefers playing in England where the speed of the game suits his innate pace. \"I know there is a lot of responsibility on me against Manchester United so I have to do the maximum.\" </p> <p>As educations go, he will be taking his degree.</p>",

Ian Wright knows a lot of people and a lot of people know him.\" </p> <p>Clearly the old cliche \"quoted out of context\" must apply here because, as has been stated this week, Wrighty had no involvement whatsoever in the De Ornelas business.

      "trailText": "<p>Watford visit Bradford this afternoon in a battle that could determine either club's future in the Premiership. Jon Brodkin talks to Bradford manager Paul Jewell who's been feeling the strains of life in football's fast lane but has yet to throw in the towel.</p>",
      "byline": "Jon Brodkin",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>If Watford need an injection of confidence before their crucial game at Bradford this afternoon, they should arrive by train. The signs at Interchange station suggest the locals were never convinced their football team could live with big boys. \"Welcome to Bradford,\" the signs say, \"Home of the Bulls.\" </p> <p>Given that both sides are, to put it mildly, knee-deep in it, the wording is appropriate. Indeed at least one Bradford player believes their chances of survival hinge on today's result. And the abuse Paul Jewell suffered from his own fans at Hillsborough last weekend points to a worrying loss of faith at Valley Parade. </p> <p>\"I think that was the lowest I've been,\" the manager says. \"I was still feeling it three days later.\" Hardly surprising when scornful chants of \"You don't know what you're doing\" greeted his substitution of Stuart McCall. Welcome to another victim of his own success. And they reckon goldfish have short memories. </p> <p>\"I think there are a few people waiting to say 'I told you so', people who didn't want me to get the job in the first place,\" says Jewell, whose appointment in 1998 did not spark dancing in the streets. \"I've just got to prove them wrong again. I'm not one for patting myself on the back but you have to live in the real world. It was only three seasons ago we had to beat QPR to stay in the First Division. If this time last year you had asked all those people who criticised me whether they would like to be third from bottom of the Premier League, I think they'd have taken it. We're way ahead of schedule. </p> <p>\"We need the fans to stay with us. We're not in the Northern Premier League, we're in the Premier League and we should be proud of that. Everyone - players, manager, supporters - should be bursting with pride that we're in the Premier League and still fighting.\" </p> <p>Whether they can sustain the fight should become apparent today. Recent defeats by Southampton, Gillingham and Sheffield Wednesday do not bode well. Attempts to buy Craig Hignett and Marcus Stewart from Barnsley and Huddersfield this week have failed. \"It's a game we need to win badly,\" Jewell admits. </p> <p>He says only the bottom four are in real danger, and unless Southampton lose their way or their manager, their escapology expertise should see them through. Whereas Bradford - with Neil Redfearn, a bad-luck charm at Barnsley and Charlton in the past two seasons - are heading straight back down along with Watford and accompanied by Wednesday. </p> <p>Watford and Bradford are not short of spirit. What they lack are goals and players who can turn a match, a Matt le Tissier of old, for instance. \"It's certainly a matter of quality,\" says Jewell. \"My players have been magnificent but this Premier League takes it out of you, not just physically but mentally. </p> <p>\"More often than not my players are up against people better at their jobs than they are, so they have to climb a level every week to get a result. It took a monumental effort against Chelsea to get a draw and since then we've been flat.\" </p> <p>If Bradford's match with Watford is pivotal, Jewell can walk on with marginally more hope in his heart. Watford's improving attack is too often undone by a Luxembourg-style defence; Bradford have the greater experience, using \u00a32.8m to bring in Dean Saunders, David Wetherall and Redfearn among others. More will be spent. </p> <p>\"I thought experience was important because at times like this they're the people you look to,\" Jewell says. \"Every manager would like good young players. But to buy top Premier League players who are young... well, we just can't get them.\" </p> <p>Nor of course can Watford, though their approach has been different. Youth and imports have featured far more prominently. Riskier perhaps in the short term but arguably better if the club go down. </p> <p>Graham Taylor has used 11 home-grown players to Jewell's three. Only one of his 11 buys is over 30 and he, Xavier Gravelaine, has joined initially until May. Taylor has spent his \u00a33.4m carefully, always with the future in mind. </p> <p>\"It would be irresponsible if we spent \u00a39m or \u00a310m with no guarantee of staying in the Premiership,\" he said. \"We should be developing the club. That's why I'd rather give boys like David Perpetuini [a 20-year-old midfielder] a chance when we've got players injured. </p> <p>\"We've got to make sure that even if we're relegated there's money to spend, so in two or three years' time we've got every chance of competing with the big boys.\" </p> <p>With Geoffrey Richmond as chairman Bradford should have few financial worries, but they are caught in a cycle of perpetual buying. The good news is that the reserves are flourishing and the club may start an academy next season. Jewell, though, faces a more immediate rebuilding programme on his ageing squad. </p> <p>And some advice from one of his thirtysomethings, Saunders. Away from home Bradford have frequently tried to nullify their opponents, but Saunders says: \"You have got to have a go at teams and not be in awe of them. If you sit back, good players don't make mistakes. No one likes it when you can't control the ball without three men around you, and that's what we've got to do.\" </p> <p> <strong> Barnsley </strong></p> <p><strong>Relegated </strong> 1998 </p> <p><strong> Now </strong> Fourth in First Division </p> <p>\"Our finances are under control. I've always tried to run the thing with a degree of sanity. Set against the backdrop of massive wage inflation it's not always easy to do, but we have to do that and retain our ambition.\" </p> <p><strong> Chairman John Dennis </strong></p> <p><strong>Swindon Town </strong></p> <p><strong>Relegated </strong> 1995 </p> <p><strong> Now </strong> 24th in First Division </p> <p>\"We have tried in vain to live with the action plan initiated two years ago to achieve a play-off position in Division One and achieve Premiership status. It appeared right at the time but now it seems a foolish gamble.\" </p> <p><strong> Chairman Cliff Puffett</strong></p>",

      "bodyText": "If Watford need an injection of confidence before their crucial game at Bradford this afternoon, they should arrive by train. The signs at Interchange station suggest the locals were never convinced their football team could live with big boys. \"Welcome to Bradford,\" the signs say, \"Home of the Bulls.\" Given that both sides are, to put it mildly, knee-deep in it, the wording is appropriate. Indeed at least one Bradford player believes their chances of survival hinge on today's result. And the abuse Paul Jewell suffered from his own fans at Hillsborough last weekend points to a worrying loss of faith at Valley Parade. \"I think that was the lowest I've been,\" the manager says. \"I was still feeling it three days later.\" Hardly surprising when scornful chants of \"You don't know what you're doing\" greeted his substitution of Stuart McCall. Welcome to another victim of his own success. And they reckon goldfish have short memories. \"I think there are a few people waiting to say 'I told you so', people who didn't want me to get the job in the first place,\" says Jewell, whose appointment in 1998 did not spark dancing in the streets. \"I've just got to prove them wrong again. I'm not one for patting myself on the back but you have to live in the real world. It was only three seasons ago we had to beat QPR to stay in the First Division. If this time last year you had asked all those people who criticised me whether they would like to be third from bottom of the Premier League, I think they'd have taken it. We're way ahead of schedule. \"We need the fans to stay with us. We're not in the Northern Premier League, we're in the Premier League and we should be proud of that. Everyone - players, manager, supporters - should be bursting with pride that we're in the Premier League and still fighting.\" Whether they can sustain the fight should become apparent today. Recent defeats by Southampton, Gillingham and Sheffield Wednesday do not bode well. Attempts to buy Craig Hignett and Marcus Stewart from Barnsley and Huddersfield this week have failed. \"It's a game we need to win badly,\" Jewell admits. He says only the bottom four are in real danger, and unless Southampton lose their way or their manager, their escapology expertise should see them through. Whereas Bradford - with Neil Redfearn, a bad-luck charm at Barnsley and Charlton in the past two seasons - are heading straight back down along with Watford and accompanied by Wednesday. Watford and Bradford are not short of spirit. What they lack are goals and players who can turn a match, a Matt le Tissier of old, for instance. \"It's certainly a matter of quality,\" says Jewell. \"My players have been magnificent but this Premier League takes it out of you, not just physically but mentally. \"More often than not my players are up against people better at their jobs than they are, so they have to climb a level every week to get a result. It took a monumental effort against Chelsea to get a draw and since then we've been flat.\" If Bradford's match with Watford is pivotal, Jewell can walk on with marginally more hope in his heart. Watford's improving attack is too often undone by a Luxembourg-style defence; Bradford have the greater experience, using \u00a32.8m to bring in Dean Saunders, David Wetherall and Redfearn among others. More will be spent. \"I thought experience was important because at times like this they're the people you look to,\" Jewell says. \"Every manager would like good young players. But to buy top Premier League players who are young... well, we just can't get them.\" Nor of course can Watford, though their approach has been different. Youth and imports have featured far more prominently. Riskier perhaps in the short term but arguably better if the club go down. Graham Taylor has used 11 home-grown players to Jewell's three. Only one of his 11 buys is over 30 and he, Xavier Gravelaine, has joined initially until May. Taylor has spent his \u00a33.4m carefully, always with the future in mind. \"It would be irresponsible if we spent \u00a39m or \u00a310m with no guarantee of staying in the Premiership,\" he said. \"We should be developing the club. That's why I'd rather give boys like David Perpetuini [a 20-year-old midfielder] a chance when we've got players injured. \"We've got to make sure that even if we're relegated there's money to spend, so in two or three years' time we've got every chance of competing with the big boys.\" With Geoffrey Richmond as chairman Bradford should have few financial worries, but they are caught in a cycle of perpetual buying. The good news is that the reserves are flourishing and the club may start an academy next season. Jewell, though, faces a more immediate rebuilding programme on his ageing squad. And some advice from one of his thirtysomethings, Saunders. Away from home Bradford have frequently tried to nullify their opponents, but Saunders says: \"You have got to have a go at teams and not be in awe of them. If you sit back, good players don't make mistakes. No one likes it when you can't control the ball without three men around you, and that's what we've got to do.\" Barnsley Relegated 1998 Now Fourth in First Division \"Our finances are under control. I've always tried to run the thing with a degree of sanity. Set against the backdrop of massive wage inflation it's not always easy to do, but we have to do that and retain our ambition.\" Chairman John Dennis Swindon Town Relegated 1995 Now 24th in First Division \"We have tried in vain to live with the action plan initiated two years ago to achieve a play-off position in Division One and achieve Premiership status. It appeared right at the time but now it seems a foolish gamble.\" Chairman Cliff Puffett",

Creeps! </p> <p>If you're a final year student or graduate, you may find something similar happening in the world of recruitment. </p> <p>There was a time when getting your first job was fairly democratic. To win an interview with the employer of your dreams you visited the campus career fair when the \"milk round\" pulled into town, and fought your way to the company's stand along with thousands of other sweaty, job-hungry students. </p> <p>But the democratic state of graduate recruitment is under attack with many employers becoming more selective in the methods they use to find recruits. </p> <p>Some have bailed out of the milk round and careers fairs, and target only certain universities. </p> <p>But an emerging trend is the invitation-only event where participants are hand-picked and viewed by an elite roster of recruiters - a bit like a beauty pageant. </p> <p>Recruitment consultant EMDS, which claims to have pioneered the concept of invitation-only 'forums' currently runs more than 50 selective events around the world each year - last weekend it was the turn of Brussels to host an event and the company confidently predicts that around 50% of the candidates who attended will receive at least two job offers as a result. </p> <p>As Martin Cerullo, manager of consultants at EDMS, is keen to point out, anyone is welcome to apply. It's as simple as filling in a career profile form in the network section of the the company's website website <a href=\"http://www.emdsnet.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.emdsnet.com</a> or sending in just an application and CV. But the EMDS database currently stands at more than 150,000 CVs and you have to be pretty darn good to make it past the bouncers. </p> <p>As an indication, EMDS received more than 2,200 applications to its last EMDS AfricaManagers forum - just 460 candidates were selected and subsequently attended. </p> <p>If selected, EMDS presents your information to the 20 to 50 companies participating in each of its forums - employers who \"specifically value your skills\". </p> <p>The privileged few are guaranteed up to five pre-scheduled interviews during the forum, and the chance to arrange as many other interviews as they wish while on site. </p> <p>So which graduates have the faces that fit? </p> <p>Typically, they are those, says EMDS with high academic performance, strong managerial potential, and outstanding intellectual and interpersonal skills. Many of the successful applicants are multilin gual with an international background and a desire to be geographically-mobile. </p> <p>So, two months before a forum, all the applications are reviewed and assessed by EMDS consultants, with criteria based on academic achievement, professional experience, language skills, international orientation, mobility and extra- curricular activities. These scrutineers also seek out attributes closely matching the employers' specific recruitment requirements. </p> <p>Then six weeks before the forum, employers receive the applications matching their search profiles. Over a period of ten days, they choose the candidates they wish to interview. </p> <p>A month before the forum, the successful applicants get their invitations in the post including at least one interview appointment from a recruiting company. </p> <p>At the forum itself, scheduled interviews are conducted from 9am to 7pm on day one and from 9am to 5pm on day two - but there's plenty of time for unscheduled interviews to take place too. EMDS also lays on company presentations, workshops and round-table discussions. </p> <p>To lessen the stress, every event takes place in a five-star hotel. Interviews are held in private rooms while hospitality suites provide the venue for informal networking. </p> <p>\"Recruiting this way means employers can be assured of quality candidates at a fration of the cost and time spent at traditional careers fairs,\" says Cerullo. \"For students and graduates, it means they can focus their time on specific employers without having to fight to be heard at a stand. </p> <p>\"It's a privilege to be selected for one of these events - something to put on your CV.\" </p> <p>EMDS flatly rejects charges of elitism. \"We give everyone the same opportunity to apply - we don't even discriminate on the grounds of which university someone attended,\" says Cerullo. \"Much of our assessment and recommendation is based on a candidate's potential. </p> <p>Some employers across the Atlantic are taking unnatural selection a step further. From the pool of 25,000 computer science students who graduate each year, Microsoft creates a shortlist of 8,000 CVs, which are reviewed to identify the 2,600 targeted for campus interviews. Following these, about 800 are invited to visit Microsoft's Redmond campus near Seattle. </p> <p>But this process leads to only 20% of Microsoft's annual recruitment. Most of the remaining 2,000 staff Microsoft brings on board each year are identified by a full-time team of 200 recruiting experts. This is Microsoft's so-called \"strike team\", whose sole job is to ferret out the industry's most talented people. </p> <p>Once someone has been identified as \"hard core\" - Microsoft's euphemism for the kind of highly talented and driven people they seek - the pursuit is relentless, if subtle. Regular telephone calls at discreet intervals, invitations for informal dinners - strike team members employ every means to keep the lines of communication open with the potential candidate. </p> <p>According to Cerullo, EMDS has been approached by several dot coms to undertake similar talent trawls. His advice on getting noticed? Be focused on what you want to do, learn another language and get into some extra-curricular activities. </p> <p>&amp;3149; The next London event is EMDS Africa Managers on April 16-18. The deadline for applications is February 24, 2000.</p>",

Recruitment consultant EMDS, which claims to have pioneered the concept of invitation-only 'forums' currently runs more than 50 selective events around the world each year - last weekend it was the turn of Brussels to host an event and the company confidently predicts that around 50% of the candidates who attended will receive at least two job offers as a result. As Martin Cerullo, manager of consultants at EDMS, is keen to point out, anyone is welcome to apply. It's as simple as filling in a career profile form in the network section of the the company's website website www.emdsnet.com or sending in just an application and CV. But the EMDS database currently stands at more than 150,000 CVs and you have to be pretty darn good to make it past the bouncers. As an indication, EMDS received more than 2,200 applications to its last EMDS AfricaManagers forum - just 460 candidates were selected and subsequently attended. If selected, EMDS presents your information to the 20 to 50 companies participating in each of its forums - employers who \"specifically value your skills\". The privileged few are guaranteed up to five pre-scheduled interviews during the forum, and the chance to arrange as many other interviews as they wish while on site. So which graduates have the faces that fit? Typically, they are those, says EMDS with high academic performance, strong managerial potential, and outstanding intellectual and interpersonal skills. Many of the successful applicants are multilin gual with an international background and a desire to be geographically-mobile. So, two months before a forum, all the applications are reviewed and assessed by EMDS consultants, with criteria based on academic achievement, professional experience, language skills, international orientation, mobility and extra- curricular activities. These scrutineers also seek out attributes closely matching the employers' specific recruitment requirements. Then six weeks before the forum, employers receive the applications matching their search profiles. Over a period of ten days, they choose the candidates they wish to interview. A month before the forum, the successful applicants get their invitations in the post including at least one interview appointment from a recruiting company. At the forum itself, scheduled interviews are conducted from 9am to 7pm on day one and from 9am to 5pm on day two - but there's plenty of time for unscheduled interviews to take place too. EMDS also lays on company presentations, workshops and round-table discussions. To lessen the stress, every event takes place in a five-star hotel. Interviews are held in private rooms while hospitality suites provide the venue for informal networking. \"Recruiting this way means employers can be assured of quality candidates at a fration of the cost and time spent at traditional careers fairs,\" says Cerullo. \"For students and graduates, it means they can focus their time on specific employers without having to fight to be heard at a stand. \"It's a privilege to be selected for one of these events - something to put on your CV.\" EMDS flatly rejects charges of elitism. \"We give everyone the same opportunity to apply - we don't even discriminate on the grounds of which university someone attended,\" says Cerullo. \"Much of our assessment and recommendation is based on a candidate's potential. Some employers across the Atlantic are taking unnatural selection a step further. From the pool of 25,000 computer science students who graduate each year, Microsoft creates a shortlist of 8,000 CVs, which are reviewed to identify the 2,600 targeted for campus interviews. Following these, about 800 are invited to visit Microsoft's Redmond campus near Seattle. But this process leads to only 20% of Microsoft's annual recruitment. Most of the remaining 2,000 staff Microsoft brings on board each year are identified by a full-time team of 200 recruiting experts. This is Microsoft's so-called \"strike team\", whose sole job is to ferret out the industry's most talented people. Once someone has been identified as \"hard core\" - Microsoft's euphemism for the kind of highly talented and driven people they seek - the pursuit is relentless, if subtle. Regular telephone calls at discreet intervals, invitations for informal dinners - strike team members employ every means to keep the lines of communication open with the potential candidate. According to Cerullo, EMDS has been approached by several dot coms to undertake similar talent trawls. His advice on getting noticed? Be focused on what you want to do, learn another language and get into some extra-curricular activities. &amp;3149; The next London event is EMDS Africa Managers on April 16-18. The deadline for applications is February 24, 2000.",

      "body": "<p>Visitors look at new places with eyes that are loaded with their perceptions about the world and where they come from. Depending on the \"view\", we can be fascinated, bored or anguished. It can be unforgettable or mundane. Our hosts, who look at that same view every day, see things differently. </p> <p>Such confusion usually makes only for passing amusement or embarrassment. But in some cases, the contradictions are fundamental and the responses more complicated. Sometimes, it is the visitors who dictate the agenda, forcing the hosts to make difficult compromises. What happens, for example, at places that were once witnesses to horror and that have now become shrines? As tourist attractions, what are they there for and for whom? And what is the responsibility of the hosts who find themselves the caretakers of such memorials? </p> <p>These questions have recently become pertinent in west Africa where some of the coastal trading forts are now open to the public. They were built for trade in gold, ivory - and slaves. Now Unesco World Heritage sites, the forts at Elmina and Cape Coast, in particular, have become key features of Ghana's tourist industry. </p> <p>The history of Elmina fort began in 1482. The Portuguese established the first European building in tropical Africa there on a promontory on the edge of the Atlantic. Trading with African partners, its wealth was generated from the hinterland - a land of gold and, later, slaves destined for the Middle Passage. The Dutch captured Elmina in 1637 (being pragmatic Protestants they turned its chapel into an auction house). Then it was the turn of the British, who held it from 1872 until independence in 1957. During British rule, it was used to imprison an Ashanti monarch. </p> <p>Since independence, Ghanaians have used it as a school, a government office and a police training academy. And now, with its buildings restored, it staunch walls whitewashed, with its views of the town's fishing fleet, the curved beach and the swirling waves of the Atlantic at its feet, it has become a tourist attraction. It has been many things to many people. And so it remains. </p> <p>For Ghanaians, the forts - and the slave trade - are one aspect of their history. Their interest as tourists to Elmina Castle may be in exploring the rooms where the Ashanti leader, King Prempeh I, was imprisoned in 1896 before being exiled to the Seychelles. Their interest as hosts may be to construct a tourism that brings money to the local economy and ensures that local people play a central role in determining what should happen at the Castle. </p> <p>For whites, the details of life in the slave forts produce a shamble of emotions. We are shown, foe example, \"the door of no return\", that narrow slit in a wall through which slaves were forced on to a waiting ship. </p> <p>The Ghanaian guide is neither melodramatic nor evasive; perhaps he edits his talk according to his clientele. Whatever, we white tourists shuffle helplessly. We cannot quite imagine ourselves as those Africans. But we can think of what role - as herders of the herded - we might have played in that dismal history.

      "bodyText": "Visitors look at new places with eyes that are loaded with their perceptions about the world and where they come from. Depending on the \"view\", we can be fascinated, bored or anguished. It can be unforgettable or mundane. Our hosts, who look at that same view every day, see things differently. Such confusion usually makes only for passing amusement or embarrassment. But in some cases, the contradictions are fundamental and the responses more complicated. Sometimes, it is the visitors who dictate the agenda, forcing the hosts to make difficult compromises. What happens, for example, at places that were once witnesses to horror and that have now become shrines? As tourist attractions, what are they there for and for whom? And what is the responsibility of the hosts who find themselves the caretakers of such memorials? These questions have recently become pertinent in west Africa where some of the coastal trading forts are now open to the public. They were built for trade in gold, ivory - and slaves. Now Unesco World Heritage sites, the forts at Elmina and Cape Coast, in particular, have become key features of Ghana's tourist industry. The history of Elmina fort began in 1482. The Portuguese established the first European building in tropical Africa there on a promontory on the edge of the Atlantic. Trading with African partners, its wealth was generated from the hinterland - a land of gold and, later, slaves destined for the Middle Passage. The Dutch captured Elmina in 1637 (being pragmatic Protestants they turned its chapel into an auction house). Then it was the turn of the British, who held it from 1872 until independence in 1957. During British rule, it was used to imprison an Ashanti monarch. Since independence, Ghanaians have used it as a school, a government office and a police training academy. And now, with its buildings restored, it staunch walls whitewashed, with its views of the town's fishing fleet, the curved beach and the swirling waves of the Atlantic at its feet, it has become a tourist attraction. It has been many things to many people. And so it remains. For Ghanaians, the forts - and the slave trade - are one aspect of their history. Their interest as tourists to Elmina Castle may be in exploring the rooms where the Ashanti leader, King Prempeh I, was imprisoned in 1896 before being exiled to the Seychelles. Their interest as hosts may be to construct a tourism that brings money to the local economy and ensures that local people play a central role in determining what should happen at the Castle. For whites, the details of life in the slave forts produce a shamble of emotions. We are shown, foe example, \"the door of no return\", that narrow slit in a wall through which slaves were forced on to a waiting ship. The Ghanaian guide is neither melodramatic nor evasive; perhaps he edits his talk according to his clientele. Whatever, we white tourists shuffle helplessly. We cannot quite imagine ourselves as those Africans. But we can think of what role - as herders of the herded - we might have played in that dismal history. But then, with the tour over, we have a drink in the caf\u00e9, turn our back on the fort and watch the fishing boats, a picturesque tourist image of bustling, modern Ghana. So, too, can African-Americans. But they are not there to admire the view. For them, the forts hold a particular intensity. As an American anthropologist pointed out, for some visitors from the black diaspora, the \"castles are sacred ground not to be desecrated. They do not want the castles to be made beautiful or to be whitewashed. They want the original stench to remain in the dungeons.\" For them, these unembellished forts are places of pilgrimage.

      "body": "<p>It was my second visit to Cape Town, and this time I was determined to do what I'd shied away from last time: climb Table Mountain. This time I had brought a friend with me, Chris. He was a tough Scotsman, and it would have been too much loss of face to cry off. So we had breakfast, and made our preparations - mine consisting of little more than changing into an old pair of jeans. </p> <p>Our hotel, the Mount Nelson, was handily placed for the ascent; it also did a good line in canvas laundry bags, into one of which we packed three bottles of mineral water. It would, we believed, be enough to see us through the 1,086m climb. </p> <p>First, we had to break out of the city, and the ever-present ARMED ALERT signs bearing witness to Cape Town's crime epidemic, and walk up grassy paths under the shade of enormous bluegums. </p> <p>We only had a rough idea of which one to take (there are 350 recognised paths to the summit), but the sight of the mountain, with its cable-station on the \"table\" drew us on well enough. We set ourselves the initial target of a lonely tree about half way up, and pressed on. </p> <p>The cover of bluegums soon gave way to other vegetation on the lower slopes, gorgeous plants appearing nowhere else on earth, such as the rare Silver Tree and the wild orchid Disa Uniflora. The real attraction, though, was the sandstone-sculpted summit of the table itself, measuring 3km from end to end. There was no \"tablecloth\" today (as Capetonians call the layer of cloud that sometimes boils over the edge), and we were already beginning to see stupendous views: the panorama stretches from Table Bay to False Bay, and around the mountain to Hout Bay Valley and Kommetjie. </p> <p>My jeans were turning out to be a very bad fashion choice for mountain climbing, impeding every upwards step. So, impervious to embarrassment, I took them off, and continued - in my boxer shorts, my shirt hanging out - with greater ease. I was glad there were no other walkers about, though: everyone else seemed to be coming by vehicle up the Tafelberg Road and into the cable-car's lower station. </p> <p>For us, the lonely tree having long been passed, the upper station, right on top of the summit was now the object. Navigation, at this point, became more difficult: we were now hard by the face of the rock, zigzagging up on paths that were becoming ever narrower. </p> <p>We had seen no one at close quarters till, rounding a corner, we came up on a couple sitting in the crook of rock. They were both white (one of the saddest hangovers of the apartheid era is that you see very little of the rainbow nation on the Cape Peninsula's premier tourist attraction) and had the wiry look of those who knew the mountain well. </p> <p>They looked at us with something like disdain and, since they didn't seem keen for conversation, we made to continue. Then, as we were turning away, there came a voice heavily accented with Afrikaans. \"Do you know the mountain well?\" </p> <p>\"Not too well,\" I replied. </p> <p>\"Well, you don't want to go that way,\" said the man, who was wearing an old, black-felt voortrekker's hat with a feather in the band. \"Take the path to the right.\" </p> <p>Thus corrected, we continued on our way, until we reached a second rock face. Here, Chris noticed the trace of a fossil in the rock, and we stopped for a moment to inspect it - a trilobite, perhaps, from times long ago when this mountain was underwater, or some other ancient remnant of a 245-million-year-old aquatic crawler or burrower. </p> <p>At this point, it seemed to be taking that sort of stretch of time to get anywhere. Like all mountains, this one was deceptive, reserving its longuers till last. We weren't alone now, anyway: some South African students were snapping at our heels. </p> <p>I was all for chickening out and doing the rest of the trip by cable-car. It wasn't far back down to the lower station, and the shiny, beetle-shaped car looked far easier a prospect than the rocky scramble we were now faced with. But the sight of competition spurred Chris on, and we made a concerted effort to reach our next staging-post before them. </p> <p>There was no doubting the majesty of the place, and its ecological peculiarity: the crevices and boulders scattered about us were inhabited by strange, rodent-like creatures called Rock Dassies, whose closest living relative is the elephant. And as if that wasn't enough, we now had further magnificent views, across the Cape Flats to the Hottentots Holland Mountains. Out to sea was Cape Point itself, where the merging of the Indian and Atlantic Oceans bring warm and cold currents together in a climatic confusion of mist and cloud. Around us, far above, swirled the sweet smell of the fynbos, a low bush whose leaves make a delicious tea. </p> <p>Yes, the birds were singing, the bees were buzzing, and God was in his Heaven... but I had no thought for any of this: my legs were filled to the brim with lactic acid, my breath was burning in my chest, and my tongue thickening in my mouth. I reached for our water-bottle and realised, horrified, that we only had a little left. This was serious: the sun was now beating down, and I had brought no hat. </p> <p>Still, not far to go and, once we got to the top, we could, along with the 600,000 other (normal) people, who take the more sensible route annually, come down by cable-car. </p> <p>But it wasn't going to happen like that. Near a tight gorge in the rock, leading to the other side of the mountain, we came upon the students. Somehow, by taking another path, they had managed to overtake us. They were sitting at the foot of a crevice, down the middle of which ran a chain, some 15m long. Surely we weren't expected to avail ourselves of it. </p> <p>We were so, and I knew that I couldn't. I made my uncertainty known to Chris, and he accommodatingly agreed that we would instead squeeze through the crevice and try another route on the other side of the mountain. We made our shameful retreat, leaving the South Africans to haul themselves up. </p> <p>\"You know you've got no trousers on?\" one of them said to me, brightly, as we turned around. </p> <p>That parting shot, and the gleam in the eye of a large, strikingly beautiful crimson-and-green rock lizard should have warned me. The path was soon gone, and we spent two painful hours making our way through thick, thorny bush looking for a way up when we realised there wasn't one. And no way back, if we were to get down before sudden, tropical dark. We'd come too far now to get to the cableway, or to retrace our steps. I began to think of helicopter rescues and midnight airlifts. There was nothing for it but to cut straight down. </p> <p>Which is what we did, sliding and scraping on our backsides for a good four hours. My jeans, back on now, were ripped to shreds, as were my face and forearms. The sun was hotter than ever and my face was beginning to blister. It had even begun to take its toll on Chris, who had resorted to tying the laundry bag over his head, like an Arab burnous. </p> <p>Dehydration soon set in as well, and I do believe I began to hallucinate a little. By the time we reached the foothills - we were on so different a part of the mountain that we were heading not for the city itself but the neighbouring beach resort of Camp's Bay - I was staggering and grabbing for support at the rare flora I had admired on the way up. There were many moments I didn't think we would make it. </p> <p>But at last we cleared the scrub, and hit a dirt track that eventually opened into the upscale suburbs of Camp's Bay. Surely we'd now be able to find a bar, somewhere to slake our thirst. Oh no, this was white South Africa at its meanest, for zoning regulations had long ago forced out the kind of roadside shack selling soft drinks you'd find anywhere else on the continent. More ARMED ALERT signs, together with the sight of chained-up alsatians, put us off nipping into someone's garden to swig from a hosepipe. We looked pretty strange now, anyway: me with my tattered jeans and flash-fried face, Chris with the laundry bag over his head, and both of us covered in dirt and lesions. </p> <p>We had to walk for another hour before hitting the main drag of Camp's Bay, where, faint from heat exhaustion, we fell into the Jazz Caf\u00e9 and sank two litres of mineral water and seven cans of Coke apiece.

Jibs were secured, knots were tied, loose crockery was put away, drinks were finished and then suddenly, as if rousing herself from a deep sleep, the Grandi I gave one last lazy pitch forward - and took off across the waves. </p> <p>This was the fifth day of our week-long cruise around the Turquoise Coast, the sun-baked southwestern shores of Turkey that once housed the ancient independent kingdom of Lycia, and it wasn't the first time Captain Umit had raised the sails. But we'd never had a wind as fast as this. </p> <p>The Grandi I - a sleek, 29m, 100-ton yacht - swayed from side to side like a drunk as she ploughed through the waves at an exhilarating 10 knots, turning passengers into human pinballs as we tried to serve ourselves lunch or raced to nab the best seat in the house: the bowsprit, or beam overhanging the front, where every movement of the boat was magnified, every spray-lashed second breathtaking. </p> <p>I was one of nine passengers who had come aboard the Grandi I, one of a fleet of seven yachts, at a quiet cove near Marmaris, a large developed resort whose intricate, bazaar-strewn backstreets have been all but eclipsed by the sprawl of concrete. After dumping our bags in the mahogany-lined cabins belowships, it was shoes and socks off and up on to the aftdeck for champagne with the captain, who spread out a well-worn map of the waters we would be navigating, and the ports we would visit. </p> <p>Spending a week in a confined space with a handful of strangers might be some people's idea of hell. Cynics may find it hard to believe but Tussock, the people who organise these cruises, insist their groups always get along, as they take great care in ensuring a good mix: singles, couples, whatever, whoever, so long as they're likely to gel. They even take pop stars, and have performed weddings at sea. Our group, a not-exactly-shy bunch of twenty-, thirty- and fortysomethings, seemed to hit it off right away; but maybe it's not that hard to break the ice when the needle's nearing 90, the cooler's crammed with booze, everyone's on holiday, the Med's your oyster and there's a daily excursion to look forward to. </p> <p>Despite the occasional burst of speed with the sails hoisted, mornings and early afternoons were mostly given over to taking it easy. We'd rise whenever we wanted, tease whoever had overdone it the most the previous night, help each other smear on the factor 16, then ooh and aah over what new treat Selahattin, our cook, had prepared for breakfast. One day it was chopped apple in light yogurt, another day banana slices doused with dark honey still dripping from the comb - always fresh, always delicious, always different and always served up with feta cheese, eggs, olives, nuts, sliced tomatoes and Turkish coffee so thick you could barely get the spoon in. </p> <p>No one, we were told, loses weight on these cruises, despite the fact that the moment the Grandi I dropped anchor anywhere we'd cool off with a plunge into the clear blue waters, and the crew would look out the ship's canoeing, windsurfing and snorkelling equipment for us to go up and down quiet coves making noisy nuisances of ourselves. </p> <p>Selahattin used to be a fisherman, in the days when these waters still had plenty of fish. But now, as we discovered on a shopping excursion to Fethiye, tourists are the main catch. \"My friend, my friend,\" we heard constantly as we strolled past the bars, caf\u00e9s, restaurants, carpet stores and sweet shops that make up this pleasant town. \"Come in, yes please. Where you from?\" </p> <p>I stopped off at a simple store for a box of Turkish delight - not the jellied variety dusted with sugar, but the rolls of curled-over candy steeped in rose water and dotted with pistachio nuts that come in flavours like banana, fig or chocolate, and have to be snipped into slices with scissors. \"Glasgow?\" said the shopkeeper when I told him where I was from. \"See you, Jimmy!\" he growled, then named some pubs in the city centre before pulling a cross-eyed face and saying: \"Get oot ma road ya wee bampot!\" </p> <p>If it was a gimmick, it was a pretty good one and, before I knew it, I was sitting on a chair in the middle of the shop, drinking apple tea and being introduced to his family. Fifteen minutes later, I left laden with four boxes of Turkish delight, five pots of crushed-nut honey, a cup with the tail of a fish for a handle, a bright blue-and-yellow ashtray, a stone turtle, and a huge, elaborately hand-painted plate. He named a price and I paid it, lacking the strength and the nous to haggle, as is expected. It was still early evening when I headed back to the boat, but over my shoulder I could see him excitably shutting up shop, possibly for the rest of the month. </p> <p>Our first big excursion had, by contrast, been to ancient ruins in Letoon and Xanthos, the heartland of ancient Lycia. Situated near the southern port of Kas, both sites are a great introduction to the rich history that ancient Lycia and its environs boast (despite the fact that much of what was uncovered here in the 1800s was plundered for Britain). For thousands of years, these Turkish shores were the stage for invading armies and ancient civilisations: Luwians, Hurians, Ionians, Trojans, Carians, Lycians and Persians. </p> <p>In 540BC, the people of Xanthos, finding their city surrounded by Persian troops, gathered up all their belongings and formed them into a giant funeral pyre. The women and children died in the flames, the men perished fighting. Only eight families, who had been away, survived. Then in 42BC, during the Roman civil war, Brutus besieged Xanthos and the citizens put their city to the torch all over again. </p> <p>My favourite character, however, was the Persian King Xerxes, who had plenty of style but little luck. In 479BC, he followed the progress of his army at the sea battle of Salamis from a throne of gold placed on a hilltop. His forces were four times more powerful than their Greek opponents but still he watched helpless as his ships sank one by one. \"My men have fought as women,\" he said, \"and my women have fought as men.\" </p> <p>Then, half a century later, there was King Mausoleus who, to keep power in his family, married his sister, Artemisia II. And so happy was she in this union that, every day after his death, she drank a glass of wine containing a sprinkling of his ashes. </p> <p>The daily excursions are all voluntary but there was one trip everyone signed up for: the hamam, or Turkish bath. Off we went, towels round our middles, legs like lava lamps thanks to badly applied suncream, each emerging into the humidity of the rounded marble bath chamber. </p> <p>At the centre of the hamam is the naval stone, a raised platform heated from below. On this we lay, as a masseur scrubbed us up and down with a kese (abrasive mitt), sloshed us with hot water, then produced a large white cotton bag into which he popped six bars of soap. This was dipped in warm water, blown into, then held tightly shut and pushed down over whoever was on the slab, causing an explosion of lather that was then massaged in. Just as I was getting the treatment, a Turkish bloke in the corner began a chant so low and penetrating it seemed to come from the marble itself. As the tiny bubbles of lather popped in my ears, it felt like I was drifting off on a magic carpet. </p> <p>We had eaten ashore the day before, at an attractive little port called Kalkan, taking the biggest table in a seafood restaurant overlooking the white walls of the harbour reddenning in the twilight. But, after the hamam, we ate back onboard the Grandi I, skin still tingling as Selahattin fried up the sea bream we'd seen him descaling that afternoon, and served it with the usual 1001 delicacies - cous cous, bulgur wheat, fried pancake rolls stuffed with cheese and parsley, goulash, carrot yogurt, artichokes with garlic - dishes that were probably as mundane and everyday to him as a cheese-and-pickle sandwich is to us. But we fell upon them and felt like royalty. </p> <p>In true Mediterranean fashion, it was over the food and drink that our group really came together. By day we'd split up into smaller groups; then, later, we'd reassemble around the long table on the aftdeck of the Grandi I, experiencing the richness of Turkey through the dishes before us. And, as the wine flowed and the captain put on Turkish music or let us play our own, we would open up to each other more and more. </p> <p>We had started the week as strangers. But now - after excursions up the labyrinthine Dalyan River to the tombs of the Lycian kings engraved in a cliff; after smearing ourselves in the skin-cleansing, grey-green mud from a warm sulphurous spring; after being tossed about in the waves at Patara Beach, one of the Med's longest; after sitting up talking, drinking and laughing around the dinner table till the small hours, then staggering off to sleep on the sundeck beneath the stars - we were as easy in each other's company as old friends. </p> <p>And beneath us, on that last night on the Turquoise Coast, was our other new friend - that giant timber cradle gently rocking us to sleep, the Grandi I. </p> <p><strong>The practaicals</strong></p> <p>Tussock cruising (<a href=\"http://www.tussockcruising.com\">www.tussockcruising.com</a>) offers one week's cruising starting from \u00a3331, including breakfast, lunch, dinner (four dinners in the course of the week) and all drinks.

Actually, Klosters, further down the valley, is the real home to Sloane skiers, aristos and City lawyers.

Long experience of Christmas or New Year in a snow-free Alps made me go for height, and since Davos itself starts at 1,500m, the snow is always available. The huge snow cannons installed on all the village-bound runs - at long last, Swiss artillery have something to fire at - ensure you can ski down to the bottom of every mountain.</p> <p> This time, there was no problem. Arriving the day after the hurricane that devastated France and Switzerland, there was plenty of snow. A rotten day of blizzard skiing, including a miserable 45 minutes in a gondola swinging wildly in 80mph cross winds, was followed by a luxuriant mix of snow by night and sun by day. Early morning runs down black slopes through white powder were sublime.</p> <p> Swissair and BA are now flying London-Zurich for under \u00a3100 - less than a second-class standard rail return to Doncaster. The best surprise, however, is how reasonably priced are the Davos hotels. We stayed in the Hotel Herrmann, a couple of minutes' walk from Davos Dorf station. Even at high season, the price for a good room with bath, a big evening meal and enough breakfast to last the day came to SFr105 - around \u00a336. The basic hotel cost for a week's skiing was \u00a3250 a head. Next door at the five-star Hotel Fluella, one of the great Alpine hotels, prices start from \u00a3100 a night for half-board, still very good value compared with what you can pay for a second-rate hotel in most British cities.</p> <p> I had two small second-year-on-skis children in my group who were handed over to the Davos ski school for the whole day. Ski teaching for children has been transformed in recent years. The learning slopes have been converted into playgrounds. Skiing becomes fun, not a series of lessons. The cost of a week's teaching is SFR222 per child, about \u00a380, including the ski lifts.</p> <p> One big complaint, however: unlike French resorts, Davos does not have a creche or baby-age kindergarten and babysitters were hard to come by and unreliable.</p> <p> The Davos ski school has 250 teachers, all of whom seem to speak excellent English. It offers a ski tour each day and a new special school for skiers in their fifties.</p> <p> The skiing is very, very good. With five distinct areas to choose from, there is variety and a chance to avoid queues. If the weather is bad, the funicular climbs to the mountain top with a great run back to the village that progresses from blue to red to black.</p> <p> The runs down to Klosters or Kublis are among the longest consecutive runs in the Alps. Davos is so high that there is always powder within sight of a piste. Challenges exist in the shape of signposted but unpisted and unpatrolled runs that either go back through wilderness to lost valleys or, like the endless jump-turns down the 'wrong' side of the Weissfluh flank, bring you back to a piste. These runs are closed off if there is danger, though it is important to bear in mind avalanche warnings: even in security-conscious Davos, accidents happen.</p> <p> If Clinton and Blair have an hour to spare, they could use it to go to the Kirchner museum beside the Davos congress centre. The German painter, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner exiled himself in Davos from the 1920s until his despair at Hitlerism drove him to suicide in 1938. He did the impossible, painting the Alps by discovering their hidden colours, instead of the white, grey, blue, green and browns of conventional mountain painters.</p> <p> High on the Jakobshorn on New Year's Day, I saw a Kirchner cloud which consisted of pinks, yellows, blues and greens swirling in changing combinations. Yet another reason why skiing is the best sport invented.</p> <p> Denis MacShane MP paid for his travel and accommodation and family costs.</p> <p> <strong>The practicals</strong></p> <p> All Davos hotels are linked into one booking system (00 41 81 415 2121).

Next door at the five-star Hotel Fluella, one of the great Alpine hotels, prices start from \u00a3100 a night for half-board, still very good value compared with what you can pay for a second-rate hotel in most British cities. I had two small second-year-on-skis children in my group who were handed over to the Davos ski school for the whole day. Ski teaching for children has been transformed in recent years. The learning slopes have been converted into playgrounds. Skiing becomes fun, not a series of lessons. The cost of a week's teaching is SFR222 per child, about \u00a380, including the ski lifts. One big complaint, however: unlike French resorts, Davos does not have a creche or baby-age kindergarten and babysitters were hard to come by and unreliable. The Davos ski school has 250 teachers, all of whom seem to speak excellent English. It offers a ski tour each day and a new special school for skiers in their fifties. The skiing is very, very good. With five distinct areas to choose from, there is variety and a chance to avoid queues. If the weather is bad, the funicular climbs to the mountain top with a great run back to the village that progresses from blue to red to black. The runs down to Klosters or Kublis are among the longest consecutive runs in the Alps. Davos is so high that there is always powder within sight of a piste. Challenges exist in the shape of signposted but unpisted and unpatrolled runs that either go back through wilderness to lost valleys or, like the endless jump-turns down the 'wrong' side of the Weissfluh flank, bring you back to a piste. These runs are closed off if there is danger, though it is important to bear in mind avalanche warnings: even in security-conscious Davos, accidents happen. If Clinton and Blair have an hour to spare, they could use it to go to the Kirchner museum beside the Davos congress centre. The German painter, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner exiled himself in Davos from the 1920s until his despair at Hitlerism drove him to suicide in 1938. He did the impossible, painting the Alps by discovering their hidden colours, instead of the white, grey, blue, green and browns of conventional mountain painters. High on the Jakobshorn on New Year's Day, I saw a Kirchner cloud which consisted of pinks, yellows, blues and greens swirling in changing combinations. Yet another reason why skiing is the best sport invented. Denis MacShane MP paid for his travel and accommodation and family costs. The practicals All Davos hotels are linked into one booking system (00 41 81 415 2121). Davos Information Centre is on 00 41 81 415 2121. Flights from BA (0345 222111) and Swissair (0234 581333).",

As a child, it always seemed the kids staying in the leafy \"resort village\" nearby were having more fun. As a teenager, I coveted the fleets of sailing dinghies and waterski boats reserved for the use of the gentil membres. A little later, I remember listening enviously to the distant thudding of a Club Med disco, convinced that sex was as freely available within the whitewashed precinct as the unlimited food and wine that I'd heard any guest could demand. </p> <p>Eventually, the temptation was too much. A friend and I hatched a plan of military precision to gatecrash the Club Med village on Eleuthra in the Bahamas. (It would be slightly overstating the operation if I didn't admit that we were already staying on the island.) Remarkably, it worked - at least until we tried to buy a drink. Ignorant of one of the most basic rules of the club - that payments of any kind were made with coloured beads rather than cash - we were swiftly unmasked and escorted to the gates. </p> <p>That episode only sharpened my image of Club Med resorts as havens of sybaritic sophistication. I had seen the promised land, but not been allowed to taste its fruits. Oddly though, even after the cost of a Club Med holiday came within range of my bank balance, it never occurred to me to actually go on one. It was like ballroom dancing - appealing in theory but essentially something that other people did. </p> <p> It took children finally to get me into a Club Med by the front door. As any parent knows, kids change nothing more than the way you think about holidays. Only a couple of short years ago, I remember agonising with my wife over whether a particular destination offered the precise combination of delicious food, good weather, interesting culture and copious activities that we craved.

There are plenty of other Club Med resorts (and more run by competitors, such as Mark Warner) offering childcare, but none promising the magical combination of what the trade calls \"winter sun\" and a creche for children as young as our one-year-old twins. </p> <p>I must confess that the idea of losing my Club Med virginity, as it were, in Florida seemed a little disappointing. After all, the point of Club Med, it had always seemed to me, was to enable relatively unadventurous travellers to take their holidays in adventurous places - or at least adventurous-sounding places. I pored longingly over pages devoted to villages with names like Turquoise (Turks &amp; Caicos), Nosy Be (Madagascar) and Rio das Pedras (Brazil) before accepting that safe, sanitised, theme-park-infested Florida was our lot. </p> <p>In fact, as any Club Med initiate knows, I might have saved myself the deliberation because aside from the trip from the airport, one Club Med holiday is pretty much like another, give or take a palm tree (and activity) or two. That, after all, was one of the key tenets on which Gerard Blitz built his empire of more than 100 resorts in 36 countries. The company moves its gentils organisateurs (essentially high-class redcoats) between resorts at roughly six-monthly intervals, secure in the knowledge that if they can do their jobs at Les Boucaniers (Martinique), they'll also be able to do them at Les Almadies (Senegal). </p> <p> Sandpiper itself is two hours north of Miami in the town of Port St Lucie. It is one of the fastest growing towns in Florida, swelling weekly with New Yorkers and other northern exiles lured by cheap property and year-round sun. Fortunately, you would never guess this from inside the Sandpiper compound, which manages to create the illusion that you have ventured more than five miles from the nearest Gap. </p> <p>The recently-renovated village is made up of a group of unassuming communal buildings clustered around three of the resort's five pools and a series of outlying accommodation blocks that give the whole place the feel of an upscale military base. Brightly-coloured pendants trumpet cheerful slogans like \"relax\", \"renew\" and \"recharge\". </p> <p>Despite the window dressing, there is a slightly dated feeling about the resort and its modus operandi . On checking in, for instance, we were issued with a vast bundle of paper coupons and plastic cards - some for claiming free drinks, some for collecting towels, others for making external phone calls. Our room, too, while spacious enough, felt firmly rooted in the 1970s. But then, as any regular would tell you, if you're the type who spends time in your room on holiday, then Club Med is probably not for you. </p> <p>As if to remind you of this fact, a whole channel on the resort's TV sets is devoted to each day's exhausting schedule of activities. For my wife, this was a delicious opportunity to marry her twin passions: sport and list-making. By the second day, I was waking up to find terrifying \"to do\" lists propped up on my bedside table: \"7am: dress kids; 8am: breakfast; 8.45am: L&amp;S to baby club; 9am: tennis lesson; 11am: golf lesson (IK sailing optional); 12am: check girls.\" </p> <p>Even my hyperactive spouse, though, balked at some of the additional activities organised throughout the day by the resort's regiment of permanently-grinning GOs. Every day at noon, for instance, the chef de village himself would lead a surprisingly large contingent of GOs and GMs in a session of \"crazy danseeeng\" around one of the resorts pools. </p> <p>The combination of this relentless high-spiritedness and the statutory delivery of all announcements in both English and French creates an atmosphere somewhere between a Butlin's camp and the Eurovision Song Contest. In the vast canteen, where GMs eat most of their meals, guests are strenuously encouraged to dine with GOs and, even more terrifyingly for us retiring Brits, other GMs. </p> <p>All this would be fine if the central premise held - that you could drop your kids at the creche and then spend a guilt-free day indulging yourself with activities ranging from golf to trapeze artistry. Unfortunately, though, it manifestly did not. Quite simply, the standard of childcare was not high enough to allow you comfortably to leave your children for any more than a couple of hours at a time. In fairness, staff shortages during our stay meant that the ratio of carers to babies was considerably poorer than the \"one to four\" the company attempts to maintain. In truth, though, even that is too stretched for staff to do anything other than attempt to mollify a band of increasingly angry babies. </p> <p>This failing is unfortunate because, in most other respects, the resort was excellent. Although most of the coaching takes place in large groups, the respective GOs offered an accessible and encouraging introduction to each of the activities we tried. While the (free) basic tennis lessons provided a perfectly sufficient challenge for terminally uncoordinated duffers, like me, Wimbledon wannabes slugged it out on an intensive three-day ATP-approved course for the relatively modest sum of \u00a3100. </p> <p>My wife, meanwhile, raved about the golf. She hadn't, she said, come across a better place to learn. There were morning and afternoon beginners' classes with bi-lingual coaches offering guidance on everything from how you stand to how to hold a club, away from the unsympathetic glare of the initiated. At Sandpiper, the beginners had their very own nine-hole pitch-and-putt course, with two 18-hole courses available for those who knew what they were doing. </p> <p>Just as it would be almost impossible even to try all the activities on offer, the thrice-daily buffets offered a choice of dizzying proportions. At each sitting, a small army of chefs turned out at least 30 different hot dishes covering the whole culinary waterfront from TexMex to fancy French, on top of the countless cold counters brimming with meats, salads and assorted cooked delicacies. </p> <p>On our penultimate night, the main attraction in the restaurant was a mountain of whole lobsters roughly the size of our front room at home. After tucking into her own, the GO with whom we were sharing a table complained that the trouble with the life of a GO at Sandpiper was the sheer abundance of everything. \"There's an abundance of food, there's abundance of alcohol and there's an abundance of sex,\" she lamented.

      "body": "<p>Wisbech, capital of the Fens, said the sign. But would it have a shop that sold fenugreek? Yes and no.</p> <p> 'Fenugreek?' said the woman behind the counter. She wasn't happy. 'I've got fenugreek,' she confessed. 'But I don't like selling it.'</p> <p> She found a packet of brown powder and, somewhat grudgingly, began pouring it out. 'It'll take weeks to get rid of the smell,' she moaned. 'The shop will smell, and my clothes... When I go home tonight, my husband will say, 'You've been selling that fenugreek again.' Now, how much did you say you wanted?'</p> <p> Twenty years on, my guilt has all but vanished. And so, too, has the tiny spice shop, snuffed out, I guess, by the new shopping precinct, where everything comes tightly sealed, and the only smell is of money.</p> <p> And not too much of that, these days. Straddling the Nene on the last leg of its journey to the Wash, Wisbech is reckoned to be the most architecturally distinguished town in Cambridgeshire outside Cambridge itself. But there's a rash of whited windows in the handsome shopping streets.</p> <p> Not that you'd notice anything amiss on North Brink. This great curve that clasps the brown river has been compared to a Dutch canal front - even to the banks of the Liffey in Dublin. Centre stage is Peckover House, 18th-century home to something you might consider an oxymoron, a Quaker banking family.</p> <p> At South Brink, across the eddying water from the Peckovers, there once lived another banker. James Hill was his name, and he had a daughter called Octavia. 'Come in,' says Ann Clayton. She has turned out especially to open the Octavia Hill Birthplace Museum for me - the museum that her husband Peter founded five years ago to celebrate the life and works of the banker's daughter.</p> <p> 'In the beginning, nobody wanted to know,' says Mrs Clayton. 'Now people come here from all over the world.'</p> <p> This town never was sure about the Hills. In 1837, James and his wife Caroline set up the Wisbech Infant School, where, instead of religion, poor children were taught 'the impor tance of truth, justice and mutual kindness and forbearance' (it soon became known as the 'Infidel School', and today survives only as the foyer of the Angles Theatre). And if all that didn't make him unpopular enough, James would organise marches to comandeer land for the poor. Then, in 1840, he went bankrupt, and Octavia was obliged to begin a rather different life on the banks of the Thames.</p> <p> That's how it all began. At 14, she was already helping at a Ragged School. One day, a little girl took Octavia to her home in Paradise Place in Marylebone, and showed her the true texture of poverty. Home was one room to an entire family, with a lodger sleeping in the corner (they have recreated the slum in the museum basement).</p> <p> 'From that day,' says Mrs Clayton, 'she never dressed up. She kept a dowdy look, because she had seen the squalor and the horror.'</p> <p> Octavia was to revolutionise the provision of housing for the poor - not only in Britain, but globally. And for her, that meant more than providing decent, affordable homes.</p> <p> 'Her style,' writes Peter Clayton in a biographical booklet, 'was patrician but not patronising.

      "bodyText": "Wisbech, capital of the Fens, said the sign. But would it have a shop that sold fenugreek? Yes and no. 'Fenugreek?' said the woman behind the counter. She wasn't happy. 'I've got fenugreek,' she confessed. 'But I don't like selling it.' She found a packet of brown powder and, somewhat grudgingly, began pouring it out. 'It'll take weeks to get rid of the smell,' she moaned. 'The shop will smell, and my clothes... When I go home tonight, my husband will say, 'You've been selling that fenugreek again.' Now, how much did you say you wanted?' Twenty years on, my guilt has all but vanished. And so, too, has the tiny spice shop, snuffed out, I guess, by the new shopping precinct, where everything comes tightly sealed, and the only smell is of money. And not too much of that, these days. Straddling the Nene on the last leg of its journey to the Wash, Wisbech is reckoned to be the most architecturally distinguished town in Cambridgeshire outside Cambridge itself. But there's a rash of whited windows in the handsome shopping streets. Not that you'd notice anything amiss on North Brink. This great curve that clasps the brown river has been compared to a Dutch canal front - even to the banks of the Liffey in Dublin. Centre stage is Peckover House, 18th-century home to something you might consider an oxymoron, a Quaker banking family. At South Brink, across the eddying water from the Peckovers, there once lived another banker. James Hill was his name, and he had a daughter called Octavia. 'Come in,' says Ann Clayton. She has turned out especially to open the Octavia Hill Birthplace Museum for me - the museum that her husband Peter founded five years ago to celebrate the life and works of the banker's daughter. 'In the beginning, nobody wanted to know,' says Mrs Clayton. 'Now people come here from all over the world.' This town never was sure about the Hills. In 1837, James and his wife Caroline set up the Wisbech Infant School, where, instead of religion, poor children were taught 'the impor tance of truth, justice and mutual kindness and forbearance' (it soon became known as the 'Infidel School', and today survives only as the foyer of the Angles Theatre). And if all that didn't make him unpopular enough, James would organise marches to comandeer land for the poor. Then, in 1840, he went bankrupt, and Octavia was obliged to begin a rather different life on the banks of the Thames. That's how it all began. At 14, she was already helping at a Ragged School. One day, a little girl took Octavia to her home in Paradise Place in Marylebone, and showed her the true texture of poverty. Home was one room to an entire family, with a lodger sleeping in the corner (they have recreated the slum in the museum basement). 'From that day,' says Mrs Clayton, 'she never dressed up. She kept a dowdy look, because she had seen the squalor and the horror.' Octavia was to revolutionise the provision of housing for the poor - not only in Britain, but globally. And for her, that meant more than providing decent, affordable homes. 'Her style,' writes Peter Clayton in a biographical booklet, 'was patrician but not patronising. She would not, for instance, go into a tenant's home without being invited.' And she didn't stop with housing. By the time she died in 1912, she had secured countless urban parks, invented the concept of the 'green belt' and more or less founded the National Trust. The river is ebbing now, surging through the little port to which this town owed its former prosperity. Here and there, the window of a vacant shop front offers free advertising space to anyone with a glue-pot. One poster crops up time and again. 'Hirameka Hi-Fi,' it says. 'Super noisy teenage punks. Upstairs at the Angles Theatre.' The Angles Theatre? Doesn't that ring a bell? Ah yes. The Infidel School.

      "body": "<p>A few years ago, a very small book was published called Birmingham Is Not A Boring City. On the title page, the word \"Not\" looked as though it had been added at the last minute in handwriting. Maybe the authors had changed their minds about the title just before it went to the publishers. Out of kindness, or a belated onrush of affection. The second city gets to you that way. </p> <p>The pub section started like this: \"There are very few good pubs in Birmingham. Most of the decent ones have been knocked down or else renovated out of all recognition.\" </p> <p>The restaurant section was hardly more reassuring: \"Most of the national guides to good food and good restaurants despair of Birmingham. And with good reason.\" This was before the age of the balti, before that drab stretch of Stoney Lane in Sparkbrook became a magnet for gourmands and for lads determined to shovel down curries as fiery as their vernacular. </p> <p>And yet despite (perhaps even because) of its reputation, I've always loved this boring city. I love the way it has had a myopic image rethink nearly every decade since that monocled mutineer Joseph Chamberlain strove to make the city into a new Athens. </p> <p>I love the way its golden-hearted citizens, reviled for their accent and their architecture, still strive oblivious, unrequited, to be loved. I love, though God knows why, the abject poetry of its crumbling brutalist architecture. If I was King Kong, I would climb up the Rotunda and hug it more dearly than he ever managed with the Empire State Building. But only because I don't know any better. </p> <p>As dusk gathered, I crested a hill just west of Coventry on the M6 and there it was, spreading its welcome embrace almost inconceivably wide, a warming orange street-light glow across the horizon. Birmingham, the Big Heart of England - no matter that it was forever beating out of time with everywhere else. </p> <p>And when I got closer, the motorway rose up on stilts and I could see the appalling energy of this city - its industry, its human homes, its inhuman roads. Few British cities lay themselves out before the motorist in this unguarded way. But then, for three decades at least this has been a road city, a redbrick Los Angeles. In its time, to be sure, Birmingham has contrived to be many things - Athens, the Venice of the north, the Paris of the Midlands and now, if the Brindley Place redevelopment is anything to go by, Dickensian confection. Birmingham has always had lots of confidence, but never the confidence to be itself. </p> <p>And then, as I rolled along the Aston Expressway, the Jacobean towers of Aston Hall, incongruous and spectral in the darkening evening, saluted me. On my left, a puff of smoke from the HP Sauce factory told me gnomically that the time of my arrival was propitious but that, if you wouldn't mind, keep your eyes on the carriageway because the looming inner ring road is a difficult beast to master. </p> <p>But I managed it. The vertiginous yank up the flyover past student tower blocks, the plummet into Great Charles Street Queensway, the jockeying for position around that hilariously named roundabout, Paradise Circus. And this is a very modern paradise: after a monumental fall, after eons of misplaced human effort mangling the divine masterplan with errant schemes, Paradise Circus is what Eden would look like. </p> <p>That night, I hit the town. There was neon, a world-class concert hall and theatres, appealing pubs and restaurants. Could this be the same city that the early 1980s guide book lampooned? </p> <p>True, even now some things remain reassuringly the same. At night, the streets seethe with girls who have legs like Cyd Charisse's and accents like Janice Nichols' (don't even pretend you know who I'm on about). And the boys, too, are still as they've always been. For generations, even on the most bitterly cold nights, they have stood under lampposts in shirt sleeves, smoking and exchanging laconic monosyllables. \"Ar,\" says one to his mate. \"Ar,\" says the other more emphatically. \"Ar,\" can mean anything here: \"Yes\", \"No\", \"Birmingham City 3, Real Madrid 0\". Anything. </p> <p>But otherwise, Broad Street was unrecognisable. They've killed off the worst buildings, scrubbed up the Victoriana and put an awning for tables outside Ronnie Scott's in the fanciful hope that Birmingham might have its own al-fresco dining culture. </p> <p>The next day, as I wandered through the morning streets, they were tearing apart the Bank of England building, once 1970s state-of-the-art, all chunky concrete and tinted windows. At the bottom of Bridge Street, there was a derelict multi-storey car park where shoppers, dreamers, lovers had laughed, cried, sweated, but finally abandoned. Everywhere ruin: I stood at the foot of an underpass below the Rotunda, and saw tiles missing, paint chipped and light fixtures trashed. As shoppers jostled me, a few tears welled up for the Birmingham that is dying and, I know, deserves no reprieve. </p> <p>I rushed for solace to the reliably wonderful City Art Gallery and Museum. There (until February 28) is an exhibition called Visions of Birmingham: the planners' dream and the peoples' reality, 1900-2030.

      "bodyText": "A few years ago, a very small book was published called Birmingham Is Not A Boring City. On the title page, the word \"Not\" looked as though it had been added at the last minute in handwriting. Maybe the authors had changed their minds about the title just before it went to the publishers. Out of kindness, or a belated onrush of affection. The second city gets to you that way. The pub section started like this: \"There are very few good pubs in Birmingham. Most of the decent ones have been knocked down or else renovated out of all recognition.\" The restaurant section was hardly more reassuring: \"Most of the national guides to good food and good restaurants despair of Birmingham. And with good reason.\" This was before the age of the balti, before that drab stretch of Stoney Lane in Sparkbrook became a magnet for gourmands and for lads determined to shovel down curries as fiery as their vernacular. And yet despite (perhaps even because) of its reputation, I've always loved this boring city. I love the way it has had a myopic image rethink nearly every decade since that monocled mutineer Joseph Chamberlain strove to make the city into a new Athens. I love the way its golden-hearted citizens, reviled for their accent and their architecture, still strive oblivious, unrequited, to be loved. I love, though God knows why, the abject poetry of its crumbling brutalist architecture. If I was King Kong, I would climb up the Rotunda and hug it more dearly than he ever managed with the Empire State Building. But only because I don't know any better. As dusk gathered, I crested a hill just west of Coventry on the M6 and there it was, spreading its welcome embrace almost inconceivably wide, a warming orange street-light glow across the horizon. Birmingham, the Big Heart of England - no matter that it was forever beating out of time with everywhere else. And when I got closer, the motorway rose up on stilts and I could see the appalling energy of this city - its industry, its human homes, its inhuman roads. Few British cities lay themselves out before the motorist in this unguarded way. But then, for three decades at least this has been a road city, a redbrick Los Angeles. In its time, to be sure, Birmingham has contrived to be many things - Athens, the Venice of the north, the Paris of the Midlands and now, if the Brindley Place redevelopment is anything to go by, Dickensian confection. Birmingham has always had lots of confidence, but never the confidence to be itself. And then, as I rolled along the Aston Expressway, the Jacobean towers of Aston Hall, incongruous and spectral in the darkening evening, saluted me. On my left, a puff of smoke from the HP Sauce factory told me gnomically that the time of my arrival was propitious but that, if you wouldn't mind, keep your eyes on the carriageway because the looming inner ring road is a difficult beast to master. But I managed it. The vertiginous yank up the flyover past student tower blocks, the plummet into Great Charles Street Queensway, the jockeying for position around that hilariously named roundabout, Paradise Circus. And this is a very modern paradise: after a monumental fall, after eons of misplaced human effort mangling the divine masterplan with errant schemes, Paradise Circus is what Eden would look like. That night, I hit the town. There was neon, a world-class concert hall and theatres, appealing pubs and restaurants. Could this be the same city that the early 1980s guide book lampooned? True, even now some things remain reassuringly the same. At night, the streets seethe with girls who have legs like Cyd Charisse's and accents like Janice Nichols' (don't even pretend you know who I'm on about). And the boys, too, are still as they've always been. For generations, even on the most bitterly cold nights, they have stood under lampposts in shirt sleeves, smoking and exchanging laconic monosyllables. \"Ar,\" says one to his mate. \"Ar,\" says the other more emphatically. \"Ar,\" can mean anything here: \"Yes\", \"No\", \"Birmingham City 3, Real Madrid 0\". Anything. But otherwise, Broad Street was unrecognisable. They've killed off the worst buildings, scrubbed up the Victoriana and put an awning for tables outside Ronnie Scott's in the fanciful hope that Birmingham might have its own al-fresco dining culture. The next day, as I wandered through the morning streets, they were tearing apart the Bank of England building, once 1970s state-of-the-art, all chunky concrete and tinted windows. At the bottom of Bridge Street, there was a derelict multi-storey car park where shoppers, dreamers, lovers had laughed, cried, sweated, but finally abandoned. Everywhere ruin: I stood at the foot of an underpass below the Rotunda, and saw tiles missing, paint chipped and light fixtures trashed. As shoppers jostled me, a few tears welled up for the Birmingham that is dying and, I know, deserves no reprieve. I rushed for solace to the reliably wonderful City Art Gallery and Museum. There (until February 28) is an exhibition called Visions of Birmingham: the planners' dream and the peoples' reality, 1900-2030.

He was to Birmingham what Baron Haussmann was to Paris, though he made neither Duddeston nor Nechells Parisian or gay.

      "body": "<p>Once, the world was full of mysteries, some of them frightening, some of them wonderful, some of them merely fascinating. Now, it can be a banal and predictable place, the tracks of daily life so well-beaten and defined, our culture awash with the imbecile obvious, our existence suffocating in safety. But mysteries remain. </p> <p>On first acquaintance, the mystery of the Mayans of Guatemala can seem simply bizarre, as it was when I first encountered Maximon the god. He was easy enough to find. We left the main street of the village; followed the cobbled sidelanes, littered with scraps of paper and rotting banana skins; stopped at the scruffy grocer's shop with the blackboard sign outside; took the side alley into the muddy courtyard; and, sweeping back the grubby curtain on the little outhouse door, we entered the dimly-lit home of Maximon, eldest of the elders, wisest of the wise, god. </p> <p>Maximon is a life-sized model of a man with a golden face and beard, who wears a western jacket and a brown flat hat and who sits on a chair on a concrete floor with several plastic pots of flowers before him and a collection of balloons and old Christmas decorations in the ceiling above. </p> <p>This morning, he was busy. A middle-aged man, whose face was creased with fatigue, was kneeling before him in the darkness, talking rapidly, arguing his case for a favour, while two attendants tipped Maximon back in his chair, poured a long slug of rum down his wooden throat, placed him upright again and pushed a cigarette, alight and smoking, between his wooden lips. The middle-aged man lit candles and then retreated to await the result of his gifts. </p> <p>What is important about Maximon is that he is there at all. He is a pagan god and yet he survives in a Guatemala, whose official religion is high-octane, high-church Roman Catholicism; and he survives not only in this dusty backroom in the western highlands and not only in the popular faith of Mayan Indians, but also in the faith of the Spanish-speaking Ladino population, whose antipathy to the Indians has been infiltrated by a reluctant respect for their intricate beliefs. They go regularly to Mayan shamans, who will draw on all kinds of ancient magic, including the sacrifice of small animals, to give them power. </p> <p>And this is the real mystery of the Mayans - their survival, for their history is one of breathtaking destruction. They have been the victims of two terrible hypocrisies. In 1523, in the name of the Catholic God of love, Spanish invaders slaughtered them in their thousands, enslaved the survivors, accidentally infected them with smallpox and typhus and measles, and then unleashed their priests who used fire and the sword to purge their beliefs and to destroy every available artefact of their civilisation. In a single day in July 1562, a Spanish bishop advanced the cause of his God by ordering the collection and destruction of every Mayan manuscript and work or art that could be found, the treasure of 4,000 years of civilisation. </p> <p>Mayans died in such numbers that their population did not return to its pre-conquest level until the 1950s, by which time the second great hypocrisy was descending upon them. </p> <p>In June 1954, in the name of democracy and freedom, US President Dwight D Eisenhower authorised a coup to unseat the elected government of Guatemala, which was alarming American corporations by redistributing land to the Mayan peasantry. The director of the CIA, who ran the coup, was Allen Dulles; he also happened to be a director of the United Fruit Company, whose massive land holdings in Guatemala were most at risk from the progressive government. That coup cast Guatemala into 42 years of instability and military government, which restored land to the US corporations, executed their opponents and banned left-wing parties. </p> <p>When socialists threatened to recapture power in 1963, President John F Kennedy, in the name of democracy and freedom, authorised another coup and, when Mayan peasants organised armed resistance, Washington's puppets embarked on a strategy of terror to suppress all opposition. In the ensuing civil war, which ended only in 1996, some two million Guatemalans, most of them Mayans, fell victim to massacre, assassination, rape, abduction, torture, disappearance, enforced exile and displacement, almost all of it supported by military aid from the most powerful country on earth. And yet the Mayans survive. </p> <p>And the strangest, most eery, most powerful symbol of their survival (far more potent than Maximon and his strange rituals) lies far away in the north of the country, in the dense, screeching jungle of the Peten region, tangled in among the jumble of breadnut trees and creepers, most of it still buried under layers of encroaching vegetation - the lost cities of the ancient Mayan kings. Truly, these are mysterious places. </p> <p>You fly from Guatemala City for just under an hour to the island city of Flores, which sits in the flat blue middle of Lake Peten Itza. The dusty hall of the airport is full of would-be guides; you find one and, together you drive back into history. </p> <p>We drove south-west for more than an hour until we came to a huddle of houses called Sayaxche, a natural crossing point on the banks of the wide, brown Rio Pasi\u00f3n, where there was a collection of amazingly long canoes with thatched roofs. We took one out on to the river and headed deep into David Attenborough country - crocodiles bellyflopping off the banks, hummingbirds and kingfishers and toucans sweeping across the water and, on each side, the immense confusion of greenery tumbling down to the river's edge. Every so often, we passed groups of thatched houses in clearings or saw fishermen feeding lines into the water. Then we came to Ceibal. </p> <p>Walking into the jungle was only slightly alarming. You watch your feet for snakes on the path and you need to be warned that in the trees, there are howler monkeys who assert themselves by imitating the roar of jaguars, a really blood-chilling sound but harmless. There are tarantulas who nest in holes in the ground but they refuse to come out, even when your guide pokes a stick in to try to prove that the spiders will sit on your shoulder without biting. Mostly, the whole place is deeply exciting and it is the fact that every inch of it is slithering with life that makes it so striking and, just as you have absorbed all this, you realise you are in the middle of a ghost city. </p> <p>Here, in a clearing, is a circular pyramid, grey stone steps leading to a flat platform. It has sat here for a thousand years; at one point, it was completely overwhelmed by vegetation; and yet the edges of the stonework are still sharp, the surface of the platform is still intact. And here, in another, much bigger clearing is a larger, rectangular pyramid and at its feet, like a row of stone doors, there stands a collection of stelae. They are flat sheets of rock, each of them carved with hieroglyphs and with the image of a man, and each of these men is different in clothing and attitude and, most of all, in facial appearance. These are real images of the past, standing alone in the middle of this jungle, snapshots of the lost kings who once ruled central America. </p> <p>Now, the mysteries begin to unfold. Where did these people come from? There are Guatemalans who will tell you they came from Israel or Atlantis or even Venus, but their facial appearance, their languages - which are built out of single syllables with multiple tones - and, most striking, their continuing habit of bowing from the waist in greeting or gratitude all suggest they are migrants from somewhere much nearer China. They were sophisticated people. In so far as the hieroglyphs and the stelae have been decoded, they reveal a people who were tracking the stars and measuring time and developing art and mathematics while the Romans were still emerging from the swamp. </p> <p> T here was also a cruelty to them. The stelae tell of wars, of the capture and slaughter of prisoners and of the public sacrifice of enemies, sometimes by decapitation, sometimes by the slicing removal of a beating heart. In the bushes in Ceibal, there is a mound of soil and root that has grown over an ancient ball court, where - if the decoding of hieroglyphs is to be believed - Mayan kings played a game slightly like basketball against their vanquished enemies before handing them over to the priests to be pitched into their journey through the underworld. </p> <p>The more you peer through the vegetation, the more of these mounds you see - palaces, temples, pyramids, water reservoirs, more stelae lying drunkenly in the undergrowth, the remains of a city that once housed some 10,000 people. Where did they go? Why - 500 years before the Spanish arrived - did they suddenly abandon the city?

      "bodyText": "Once, the world was full of mysteries, some of them frightening, some of them wonderful, some of them merely fascinating. Now, it can be a banal and predictable place, the tracks of daily life so well-beaten and defined, our culture awash with the imbecile obvious, our existence suffocating in safety. But mysteries remain. On first acquaintance, the mystery of the Mayans of Guatemala can seem simply bizarre, as it was when I first encountered Maximon the god. He was easy enough to find. We left the main street of the village; followed the cobbled sidelanes, littered with scraps of paper and rotting banana skins; stopped at the scruffy grocer's shop with the blackboard sign outside; took the side alley into the muddy courtyard; and, sweeping back the grubby curtain on the little outhouse door, we entered the dimly-lit home of Maximon, eldest of the elders, wisest of the wise, god. Maximon is a life-sized model of a man with a golden face and beard, who wears a western jacket and a brown flat hat and who sits on a chair on a concrete floor with several plastic pots of flowers before him and a collection of balloons and old Christmas decorations in the ceiling above. This morning, he was busy. A middle-aged man, whose face was creased with fatigue, was kneeling before him in the darkness, talking rapidly, arguing his case for a favour, while two attendants tipped Maximon back in his chair, poured a long slug of rum down his wooden throat, placed him upright again and pushed a cigarette, alight and smoking, between his wooden lips. The middle-aged man lit candles and then retreated to await the result of his gifts. What is important about Maximon is that he is there at all. He is a pagan god and yet he survives in a Guatemala, whose official religion is high-octane, high-church Roman Catholicism; and he survives not only in this dusty backroom in the western highlands and not only in the popular faith of Mayan Indians, but also in the faith of the Spanish-speaking Ladino population, whose antipathy to the Indians has been infiltrated by a reluctant respect for their intricate beliefs. They go regularly to Mayan shamans, who will draw on all kinds of ancient magic, including the sacrifice of small animals, to give them power. And this is the real mystery of the Mayans - their survival, for their history is one of breathtaking destruction. They have been the victims of two terrible hypocrisies. In 1523, in the name of the Catholic God of love, Spanish invaders slaughtered them in their thousands, enslaved the survivors, accidentally infected them with smallpox and typhus and measles, and then unleashed their priests who used fire and the sword to purge their beliefs and to destroy every available artefact of their civilisation. In a single day in July 1562, a Spanish bishop advanced the cause of his God by ordering the collection and destruction of every Mayan manuscript and work or art that could be found, the treasure of 4,000 years of civilisation. Mayans died in such numbers that their population did not return to its pre-conquest level until the 1950s, by which time the second great hypocrisy was descending upon them. In June 1954, in the name of democracy and freedom, US President Dwight D Eisenhower authorised a coup to unseat the elected government of Guatemala, which was alarming American corporations by redistributing land to the Mayan peasantry. The director of the CIA, who ran the coup, was Allen Dulles; he also happened to be a director of the United Fruit Company, whose massive land holdings in Guatemala were most at risk from the progressive government. That coup cast Guatemala into 42 years of instability and military government, which restored land to the US corporations, executed their opponents and banned left-wing parties. When socialists threatened to recapture power in 1963, President John F Kennedy, in the name of democracy and freedom, authorised another coup and, when Mayan peasants organised armed resistance, Washington's puppets embarked on a strategy of terror to suppress all opposition. In the ensuing civil war, which ended only in 1996, some two million Guatemalans, most of them Mayans, fell victim to massacre, assassination, rape, abduction, torture, disappearance, enforced exile and displacement, almost all of it supported by military aid from the most powerful country on earth. And yet the Mayans survive. And the strangest, most eery, most powerful symbol of their survival (far more potent than Maximon and his strange rituals) lies far away in the north of the country, in the dense, screeching jungle of the Peten region, tangled in among the jumble of breadnut trees and creepers, most of it still buried under layers of encroaching vegetation - the lost cities of the ancient Mayan kings. Truly, these are mysterious places. You fly from Guatemala City for just under an hour to the island city of Flores, which sits in the flat blue middle of Lake Peten Itza. The dusty hall of the airport is full of would-be guides; you find one and, together you drive back into history. We drove south-west for more than an hour until we came to a huddle of houses called Sayaxche, a natural crossing point on the banks of the wide, brown Rio Pasi\u00f3n, where there was a collection of amazingly long canoes with thatched roofs. We took one out on to the river and headed deep into David Attenborough country - crocodiles bellyflopping off the banks, hummingbirds and kingfishers and toucans sweeping across the water and, on each side, the immense confusion of greenery tumbling down to the river's edge. Every so often, we passed groups of thatched houses in clearings or saw fishermen feeding lines into the water. Then we came to Ceibal. Walking into the jungle was only slightly alarming. You watch your feet for snakes on the path and you need to be warned that in the trees, there are howler monkeys who assert themselves by imitating the roar of jaguars, a really blood-chilling sound but harmless. There are tarantulas who nest in holes in the ground but they refuse to come out, even when your guide pokes a stick in to try to prove that the spiders will sit on your shoulder without biting. Mostly, the whole place is deeply exciting and it is the fact that every inch of it is slithering with life that makes it so striking and, just as you have absorbed all this, you realise you are in the middle of a ghost city. Here, in a clearing, is a circular pyramid, grey stone steps leading to a flat platform. It has sat here for a thousand years; at one point, it was completely overwhelmed by vegetation; and yet the edges of the stonework are still sharp, the surface of the platform is still intact. And here, in another, much bigger clearing is a larger, rectangular pyramid and at its feet, like a row of stone doors, there stands a collection of stelae. They are flat sheets of rock, each of them carved with hieroglyphs and with the image of a man, and each of these men is different in clothing and attitude and, most of all, in facial appearance. These are real images of the past, standing alone in the middle of this jungle, snapshots of the lost kings who once ruled central America. Now, the mysteries begin to unfold. Where did these people come from? There are Guatemalans who will tell you they came from Israel or Atlantis or even Venus, but their facial appearance, their languages - which are built out of single syllables with multiple tones - and, most striking, their continuing habit of bowing from the waist in greeting or gratitude all suggest they are migrants from somewhere much nearer China. They were sophisticated people. In so far as the hieroglyphs and the stelae have been decoded, they reveal a people who were tracking the stars and measuring time and developing art and mathematics while the Romans were still emerging from the swamp. T here was also a cruelty to them. The stelae tell of wars, of the capture and slaughter of prisoners and of the public sacrifice of enemies, sometimes by decapitation, sometimes by the slicing removal of a beating heart. In the bushes in Ceibal, there is a mound of soil and root that has grown over an ancient ball court, where - if the decoding of hieroglyphs is to be believed - Mayan kings played a game slightly like basketball against their vanquished enemies before handing them over to the priests to be pitched into their journey through the underworld. The more you peer through the vegetation, the more of these mounds you see - palaces, temples, pyramids, water reservoirs, more stelae lying drunkenly in the undergrowth, the remains of a city that once housed some 10,000 people. Where did they go? Why - 500 years before the Spanish arrived - did they suddenly abandon the city? And all this is nothing compared with the ruins of Tikal, several hours to the north. When you first come through the tall trees at Tikal and you see in front of you the Temple of the Great Jaguar, climbing up towards the sky, layer upon layer of stonework, crowned with the statue of a seated man with a serpent upon a throne, and when you reach into your imagination and restore the bright red and green and cream paint with which it was once decorated and you conjure up the crowd of Mayan men and women, milling down below, and you hear the sound of their excitement as the priest steps out on to the platform at the dizzy peak of the pyramid to begin the ritual that will grant them power and favour, you know you are gazing up at the architecture of pure power. It belittles everyone beneath it. And then you turn and you see, several hundred yards away to the west, the Temple of the Masks, soaring to an equal height and, in between them, to the north, the two-and-a-half-acre acropolis of temples and burial chambers and then, to the south, the maze of palaces, linked by a burrow of passages, and you know you are looking at the hub of an awesome empire. It began to grow some 3,000 years before the birth of Christ and spread eventually across a vast acreage of territory, into what is now El Salvador and Honduras and southern Mexico. It rose and ruled and then collapsed 500 years before any European ever set eyes on it. And no one knows why. The archaeologists can date its demise to the end of the 9th century AD, by dating the fragments of pots they find in the ruins. Simply, there are none after that. Perhaps the city was hit by an earthquake or the fall-out from a volcano, but there is no geological sign of that. Perhaps there was some kind of rebellion and the power-elite were slaughtered. But why would the successful rebels then abandon the city they had won? Perhaps, the Mayan kings were the first power to succumb to a rebellion by their own environment; some believe they tore up too much of the rain forest, that the topsoil blew away and slipped into their water reservoirs, hurling them into starvation and drought. It is clear that they lost everything.

Yet the ear is as gratifying as the voice in this poised and relentlessly funny first novel. Zadie Smith's terrain is the English metropolis - concentrated in an area of north-west London from Marble Arch to Cricklewood - where she tunes in to a Babel of voices, registering the changes wrought in the language and landscape by the unfolding epic of post-war migration. </p> <p>At its heart are two generations of two families: one white-and-Jamaican and the other Bangladeshi. Their self-styled heads are Archie Jones, a Brighton-born specialist in the folding of direct-mail leaflets, and Samad Iqbal, a Bengali Muslim biology student turned waiter with whom Archie once shared a second world war tank.

      "bodyText": "White Teeth Zadie Smith Hamish Hamilton, \u00a312.99, 480pp A debut with the zest and ambition of White Teeth is customarily hailed as the arrival of a new \"voice\" in fiction. Yet the ear is as gratifying as the voice in this poised and relentlessly funny first novel. Zadie Smith's terrain is the English metropolis - concentrated in an area of north-west London from Marble Arch to Cricklewood - where she tunes in to a Babel of voices, registering the changes wrought in the language and landscape by the unfolding epic of post-war migration. At its heart are two generations of two families: one white-and-Jamaican and the other Bangladeshi. Their self-styled heads are Archie Jones, a Brighton-born specialist in the folding of direct-mail leaflets, and Samad Iqbal, a Bengali Muslim biology student turned waiter with whom Archie once shared a second world war tank. The old mates' conflicts with their younger wives - Clara, \"from Lambeth (via Jamaica)\", and Bangladesh-born Alsana - and their \"second-generation\" children form the core of a novel with a bizarrely complex plot and a prodigious cast.

Bad guys, mad guys and criminals are exploiting its fluidity and potential for anonymity in ways that none of the net's inventors foresaw or intended, and which no civilised society can ignore for long. <p>In the USA, so far, over 200 men have been sentenced to prison terms for the attempted or actual \"sexual solicitation\" of minors where the internet played a part in the crime. In the UK, we had the Gary Glitter case, and there are more in the pipeline, even if those involved are not quite so famous.</p> <p>So it all seems fairly obvious to me. Stand by and do nothing and we risk the emergence of a thousand virtual Mary Whitehouses, who have little stake in the internet, demanding that politicians \"do something\" to \"protect our children\" or \"get rid of the filth\". In Australia, such pressures have already been at work, and it is not hard to imagine how they might take off here.</p> <p>Attempting to censor the internet's content is not the answer - even if it were possible. However, the industry can and should do more to empower internet users to protect themselves and their loved ones. Inevitably this means we need more and better filtering tools, but that's just another way of saying we need to give people more power and choices about how they use the internet. Now who could possibly be against that?</p> <p>Yours,<br> John Carr <br> Internet consultant<br> NCH - Action for Children</p> <p><b>Dear John,</b><br> I agree that internet users need improved technologies. Not just better tools to allow us to exclude material, but better search engines, more usable sites, and faster access. We should have more power to make choices about the internet. </p> <p>However, \"industry self-regulation\" has already led to regulatory quangos and internet service providers closing sites and censoring newsgroups. We cannot have the power to make choices about material on the internet if someone else has already decided that we cannot see it.</p> <p>I know you will probably want to talk about children and pornography in an attempt to justify blocking content - it's the oldest trick in the censor's book - but I'm not just talking about this. Perfectly legal forums have been closed by ISPs, including a news site about Basque separatism, a Northern Ireland discussion group and a site criticising Britain's judicial system. All in the name of \"self-regulation\". The truth is, users are not permitted to regulate what they see; someone else does it for them. Plain old censorship in sheep's clothing.</p> <p>Yours sincerely,<br> Dr Chris Evans<br> Founder<br> <a href=\"http://www.netfreedom.org\" target=\"_new\">Internet Freedom</a></p> <p> <b>Dear Chris,</b><br> \"Self-regulation\" as it exists in the UK internet industry is no more than an organised attempt to ensure that our existing laws are upheld in cyberspace. You may not like those laws, but that's a separate issue. Any ISP that goes beyond what the law requires is doing so in its own name.</p> <p>The logic of your argument is that ISPs are compelled to carry anything their customers serve up to them: a sort of enforced libertarianism. To do that you would have to give ISPs legal immunity should something go wrong later. Anything short of this takes you back to a position where somebody has to make judgments about what is or is not acceptable - and then you have a self-regulatory system again.</p> <p>Every branch of our media has some sort of regulatory framework. Why should the internet be any different? And by the way, I thought your comments about children and pornography were rather trite. There are problems. They are not being conjured up from nothing as a ruse to justify greater oppressive controls. To paraphrase Orwell, just because it appears in the Daily Mail doesn't mean it isn't true.</p> <p>There was a time, not so long ago, when the internet was the exclusive possession of a rarefied group within our universities and research communities.

I don't think they are motivated by commercial assessment. There is little evidence that ISPs are losing revenue by failing to censor customers. On the contrary, they lose revenue by closing their accounts. I think they are motivated out of fear of being branded morally irresponsible in a climate where political correctness is the watchword of business.</p> <p>ISPs are not accountable for what internet users transmit, any more than the post office is responsible for what I write in my letters, or BT is responsible for what I say on the phone. I do not expect them to monitor the contents of my writings and conversations in the name of self-regulation.

Doubtless if that is found to be unsatisfactory, it can be revisited. So far, in relation to illegal publications on the web, the system seems to be working. But there is a great deal else that needs to be done before the internet can truly be said to be acceptable in the mass market it seems to want to occupy.</p> <p>In the end I believe that everyone should have a personal internet that suits them.

He moved to London with me and has lived with the rest of the team in the team box ever since. </p> <p>England live cheek-by-jowl with the other teams, some torchlight-strength floodlights - it was always more fun with the curtains closed - and a reduced-size replica of the Jules Rimet trophy which Bobby Moore received in triumph in 1970 (as well as 1966).

There was a rule book but most managers made up their own.

      "bodyText": "J\u00f6rg Haider, the controversial leader of Austria's far right Freedom party, is poised to make huge political gains after coalition talks between the socialists and conservatives collapsed yesterday in disarray following months of tortuous wrangling. The Freedom party (FPO) surged into second place in October's inconclusive elections on an anti-immigration platform. Since then, desperate attempts have been made by the political establishment to keep the FPO out of government. But in the past week public opinion has turned against the ruling parties, and the FPO's popularity has soared to an all-time high of 32% - 3% above the leading Social Democrats, and 5% above the FPO's standing in the election. Political analysts say that if new elections were held today the FPO would probably win. The breakdown of the traditional hegemony which has dominated Austrian politics since 1945 has boosted Mr Haider's hopes of fulfilling his long-held ambition - to become chancellor. Speaking yesterday in the province of Carinthia, where he is governor, Mr Haider said of the stalled talks: \"Why will no one give J\u00f6rg Haider a chance? The FPO is at present the only stable element.\" He has told President Thomas Klestil, who has been leading coalition talks, that in contrast to the bickering mainstream parties he could present a \"perfect government programme\" within a week. He has said he would be prepared to form a coalition with either the socialists or the conservatives. Both have so far refused to work with him. In an attempt to salvage the situation, Viktor Klima, the acting Austrian chancellor and leader of the Social Democrats, yesterday said he would try to form a minority government led by his party. The Green party, with 14 seats, has said it would be prepared to join the government. But the FPO and the conservative People's party have said they will not tolerate a minority administration. President Klestil is determined to keep Mr Haider out of negotiations, aware of the potential damage to Austria's international image if the FPO gets into government. Mr Haider, the son of a Nazi officer, has received notoriety for a series of pro-Hitler comments he has made. In 1991 he was voted out of office as governor of Carinthia for praising Hitler's employment policies. He mixed with SS veterans at their annual gathering, lauding them as \"men of character\", and described Nazi concentration camps as \"punishment camps\". During his election campaign he employed the slogan \u00dcberfremdung (overpopulation by foreigners) - a term used by the Nazi propaganda minister, Joseph Goebbels. Israel's foreign minister, David Levy, has warned that if the Freedom party entered government he would consider breaking off diplomatic relations with Austria. In response to that and similar negative reactions from abroad, Mr Haider said: \"I can't take them seriously.\" But in an effort to gain respectability with the international community, Mr Haider went on a charm offensive in London, Paris and New York to face his critics. In November he apologised for his remarks for the first time at a rally in Vienna. Asked this week what he would do if he failed to become chancellor this time round, he smiled and said: \"I've been in politics for 20 years, so what's another two or four going to matter?\"",

Dizzying stuff. But, for all the doors American Beauty may open for him, Sam Mendes says his real business is back home in Britain. By Simon Fanshawe </p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Sam Mendes - like American Beauty, the film he has directed - is not what he seems. The echoes between the soul of the film and the man himself are the reason why the film is already being spoken of as a classic. Because, for his screen debut, Mendes - renowned for precise and cool theatrical productions - has made a highly emotional movie. His response to the first draft of the script was, he says, \"instinctive\". It was also, as it turned out, another example of his canny ability to make precisely the right choice. </p> <p>Mendes is the man who reinvented the musical Cabaret, making it a massive hit in London - at the Donmar Warehouse, where he is artistic director - and on Broadway, by rescuing it from designer decadence into contemporary, sparkling musical terror; the man who has already, in little more than a decade, created two landmark Shakespeare productions, with his Tempest and Othello; who, before he was 24, had already achieved two popular classic hits in the West End (London Assurance, with Paul Eddington, and The Cherry Orchard, with Judi Dench); and who also notched up - hallmark of all bright young directors in the 90s - a pension-earning Cameron Mackintosh musical, in his case Oliver! </p> <p>Serious people who have already caught American Beauty in the US, or at the gala screening that closed last year's London Film Festival, will tell you that it is a triumph and, in all likelihood, an Oscar winner. And they're right. The normally restrained Washington Post frothed, \"One of the year's finest pictures... hilarious, painful and achingly tender.\" The blousy LA Times: \"A hell of a picture.\" The New York Times simply called it \"a triumph\". </p> <p>Which, in a way, is odd, because the film cuts at the heart of modern America, of which the media is so much a reflection, stripping away the pretence of well-being layer by layer, all the way through black comedy to poignancy. Kevin Spacey, co-star with Annette Bening, says, \"People ask, 'How does a thing like Columbine, Colorado happen?' I think this movie answers that question.\" And, somehow, that's nothing like as far-fetched as it might be from another actor about another film. What Spacey means about the Columbine school massacre is that, when the soul becomes a shopping mall, when to live is to own things, it is hardly surprising if kids turn to murder. American Beauty manages to be both hilarious and dark about that crisis in spirit. </p> <p>Through the dissolution of a suburban marriage - by way of boredom, lovelessness and the fact that, when the wife's pruning shears match her gardening gloves, it is no accident - the film suggests there is beauty next to you, that you can reach out and touch it, that people are not what they seem and that everyone's life is infinitely more interesting than they think it is. I should add that the most beautiful sequence in the film is several minutes of a plastic bag blowing in the breeze. And yet the movie is seductive and intelligent, clear-eyed and unsentimental, and tells many stories - of the couple, of their next-door neighbours, of the two children of the two families who find in each other a soulmate, of real estate, of suburbia, of sexual identity, of teen beauty and of murder - confidently cutting from one to another within a deceptively simple framework that defies easy categorisation. Whodunnit? Love Story? Comedy? Teen Angst? Live Action Cartoon? Surreal Fantasy? Or just, The American Condition at the Turn of the Century? </p> <p>Spacey and Bening are the Burnhams. He is a wilfully disillusioned adman, pathetic and admirable in equal part, who whacks off in the shower (the day goes downhill from then on), blackmails his boss when he is sacked and embarrassingly drools over his daughter's best friend. She, on the other hand, is an estate agent and a gloss-painted worshipper at the altar of material achievement. </p> <p>Mid seduction: \"Lester, you're going to spill beer on the couch.\" </p> <p>\"So what? It's just a couch.\" </p> <p>\"This is a four-thousand-dollar sofa upholstered in Italian silk. This is not 'just a couch'.\" Collapse of not only this seduction, but of the prospect of any more, ever. </p> <p>At the heart of the film are the two children, Ricky and Jane, played by Wes Bentley and Thora Birch. The former is certainly a teenage dope dealer and apparently a voyeur, a weirdo who films everything including the girl next door, a dead bird and the signature plastic bag. \"Sometimes,\" he says, \"there's so much beauty in the world I feel like I can't take it... and my heart is going to cave in.\" </p> <p>As Mendes says, \"Ricky is the film's conscience, its soul. At first, you think he is a voyeur, but you realise that Ricky is using his camera to reach out and touch people, not just to record... it's his way of reaching out.\" When talking to Mendes, you do feel that Ricky and he might have much in common. </p> <p>Dark and rather cuddly, with good looks that betray his distant Portuguese ancestry, Mendes is a lot younger-looking than his 34 years. His voice is standard public-school posh, with no concessions to Royal Court street-smart: no aitches dropped, no donkey jackets worn. He is exceptionally polite, softly spoken, not given to excess or exaggeration; only occasionally does he raise his voice. He is warm, yet always gives an impression of self-control, so you could kid yourself that he is unemotional. And there is a certain watchfulness about him, which you might assume in a director, but they're not all like that. The overwhelming impression is that Mendes is very self-contained. </p> <p>When I arrive at the offices of the Donmar Warehouse, he sits for 10 minutes or so at his desk in the open-plan office, completely absorbed in his correspondence, while we, the admin staff and I, gossip like hens in a coop not 10ft away. The actor Simon Russell Beale, one of Mendes's closest collaborators, having played Iago and Ariel for him, recounts one of the rehearsals for the Tempest at the RSC some years ago. \"He stopped the rehearsal because he knew the ending just wasn't working. And then he sat for 45 minutes in the stalls, completely on his own, just thinking. For 45 minutes. You could see his brain working. We were all chatting on the stage. And then he came up with the solution.\" </p> <p>Mendes was born in 1965, an only child. His parents, Peter and Valerie, were a university lecturer and a children's story writer. He went to Magdalen College School in Oxford, then to Cambridge, where he graduated with a first. Despite having staged what he describes as \"several terrible productions\" at university, he speedily got a job at the Chichester Festival Theatre, and within no time at all was running the nascent Minerva Studio for its first season. </p> <p>Then, when he was barely out of shorts, he took over from a senior director who dropped out of a production of London Assurance and graduated to the West End. He had the two hits there by 1989 and was becoming known as something of a wunderkind . He joined the RSC, and in 1992 started to run the Donmar, which he has programmed with an eclectic mix, from Stoppard and Sondheim to Shakespeare. He has encouraged new writing with the Four Corners season (plays drawn from the four countries of the British Isles) and launched into West End successes such as The Rise &amp; Fall Of Little Voice, Company and The Glass Menagerie. </p> <p>The work that Mendes has produced is not grand and conceptual, but draws its impact from his ability to match actor and text. Critics always praise him for finding the sense within plays, rather than looking for spurious relevance or loading them with contemporary devices. What makes him stand out is his clarity of purpose. Russell Beale says of Mendes's first show at the RSC, Troilus &amp; Cressida, \"Sam analysed the pitfalls of young directors needing to show off and completely avoided them. What he did was just very clear and very simple.\" \"You're creating an alternative universe,\" is the way the director himself puts it, \"so you're simply telling a story.\" </p> <p>Apart from his directing, there is an entrepreneurial side to his work. He has been credited with turning the Donmar Warehouse into \"the sexiest theatre in London\", perhaps because he attracts top-rate performers for bottom-rate money. They come to the Donmar for kudos or to reinvent their careers. The success of David Hare's The Blue Room, for example, transformed Mrs Tom Cruise into Nicole Kidman. And, like his contemporary Stephen Daldry, former artistic director of the Royal Court, Mendes' charm and ability to network are considerable. On the other hand, he has no appetite for public campaigning: \"I'll always help the theatre world achieve greater strength, but I don't want to be a spokesperson for the arts.\" </p> <p>He had a longish relationship with the madly talented Jane Horrocks, and was subsequently linked with Calista Flockhart and Rachel Weisz. The casting of Nicole Kidman in an artistically disappointing but publicity heat-seeking production of Hare's play made him noticed further afield than the London theatre world and gave him an aura of glamour. Next thing, he was being asked by Steven Spielberg to make the film everybody is tipping to win this year's Oscar for best picture. All very a,b,c. All very silver-spoon-in-the-mouth. But hardly predictable, even for a middle-class, privileged boy, who plays cricket in Harold Pinter's cricket team, The Gaieties. </p> <p>What fascinates about Mendes is his preter- natural confidence. How can you direct Judi Dench at 23? How can you deal with Spielberg on your first film? How do you make such clear choices in life and in art? </p> <p>He stumbles in his answer. \"I am very resistant... there are so many things going through... I don't think there is one thing in particular. You're forced to come up with key moments that kind of spur you on and then you begin to believe them yourself. Directing is such a strange thing to do with your life.\" There is the sense behind everything he says that his own palpable solitariness, within his charming and clubbable exterior, is not up for examination. Yet he seems to have put it on screen in American Beauty. \"There's no doubt that I found myself drawn to the script because I felt very personal about it. Directing is a very solitary job, in the sense that you never meet other directors. One of the things about running this building is that I get to see other directors work, so I am always learning.\" </p> <p>But he's only 34, and he has already achieved an enormous amount. How does he do it? Not just by watching others. \"There is nothing in my upbringing that explains why I do what I do.\" And then he says later, \"A great deal of it is buried in my youth. I was very bad academically at school. I didn't concentrate. I scraped through my O-levels and just got into sixth form, and then decided that, 'Hang on, I'd better take control of my own life.' </p> <p>I don't like talking about this much, because I feel responsible to my parents. I find it unfair to them.\" It is a matter of record that his parents divorced when he was five. But he elaborates and says, \"My life was turned upside down on many occasions, to the point where, if I didn't take control of my life, I would have just taken a lot of drugs or something.\" And then he says, \"the periods of calm and the periods of turmoil with each of my parents were the single most determining thing of my childhood. I took control of my life when I was 16 and kind of said, 'Stuff that. I am not going to depend on anyone else again.' Nothing can compete with the fear that everything stable in your life is out of control. Nothing's frightening after that. Not even Cameron Mackintosh!\" </p> <p>So he spent his childhood being a skilled cricketer, watching movies and reading, sheltering from the uncertainty. He says he was \"a troubled fantasist who told stories to himself\". But, in the midst of it all, he seems to have developed one skill, alongside his confidence and the decision to take control of his life. He is remarkably relaxed one-to-one. \"I mainly spent my life,\" he explains, \"with one other person, my mother.\" And this has lead to a great ability with actors. \"I love actors; I have great respect for them.\" He has unlimited willingness to communicate with them precisely in a way that they understand. \"I will go out and find what they need. My language to each of them has to suit their brain.\" </p> <p>Russell Beale tells a story: \"He stayed with me in Stratford during the technical run of Troilus &amp; Cressida, and I saw him one night with his notebook. He had just scrawled things like 'shit' or 'crap' or 'wrong' quickly during the run-through. But then he spent hours at night sitting up translating each point differently into something each actor could understand.\" </p> <p>Mendes knows this about himself. \"I am not a masterclass director,\" he says. \"I am not a teacher. I am a coach. I don't have a methodology. Each actor is different. And on a film set you have to be next to them all, touching them on the shoulder saying, 'I'm with you. I know exactly how you're working. Now try this or that...'\" </p> <p>He illustrates: \"Kevin Spacey likes to joke and piss about and do impersonations right up to the moment of action, on his mobile phone to his agent or whatever. The more relaxed, the more jovial he is, the more he's not thinking about what he does. When you say, 'Action', he's like a laser beam. His relaxation leads to spontaneity. So to Kevin you're saying, 'Give me a Walter Matthau impersonation.'\" Annette Bening, on the other hand, \"is on her Walkman half-an-hour before the cameras roll, cutting off the set, focused down, listening to music that the character would listen to\". His conclusion on his own method is simple: \"All I know is that I operate by going out to each of them and trying to learn the territory in which they operate.\" </p> <p>The script for American Beauty really came to him thanks to two productions: Oliver! and Cabaret. Spielberg had seen Oliver! in London and says now that \"it was a visual candy-store, and I sort of banked his name in my mind\". In 1998, Mendes's production of Cabaret opened in a converted nightclub in New York, and the producers of American Beauty, Bruce Cohen and Dan Jinks, saw it, as did Spielberg, whose company Dreamworks had just bought Alan Ball's script, then titled American Rose, from them.</p> <p> There were other directors' names in the frame, but Spielberg approached Mendes, asking him to lunch. \"I stuffed my face while he sipped a mud-coloured health shake,\" says Mendes. He read Ball's screenplay and was immediately taken. \"It was incredibly multi-layered, but it made me laugh. Then I read it again, and it was full of sadness and loneliness, about imprisonment and escape. Then there was this theme of beauty running through it, and it was so many different things and I just didn't know how Alan [Ball] had done it. And that really fascinated me.\" </p> <p> He storyboarded the whole film during the run of Blue Room at the Donmar. He had very clear ideas about what it should look like. When you hear him say, \"I enter things visually before I enter them emotionally\", it explains much of his work in the theatre, its completeness and unity of style and text. At times, the look of American Beauty has the remorselessly logical illogicality of a Magritte.</p> <p> There is a moment when the young cheerleader, with whom Lester has decided he is in love, opens her blouse and scores of rose petals cascade out. At another moment, she is submerged in a bath full of them. At these moments, a touch of the surreal hovers a foot above the real. But at other times, the film has the still symmetry of an Edward Hopper. \"I wanted a very composed, peaceful visual style to tell a story that was full of emotional tumult,\" he says. \"And I realised, when I was cutting it, that I had made an even more emotional film than I thought I was making. In fact, the film I read, the film I thought I was making, and the film I actually made, are three different things.\" </p> <p>It was an immaculate script by Ball, a co-executive producer and writer on the sitcom Cybill and co-writer of Grace Under Fire. But it was honed during filming. First, in editing, Mendes managed both to guide the story and to throw the audience a loop. For instance, he added an opening pre-title scene to create the first of several McGuffins, as Hitchcock called red herrings, in which the kids are filmed solemnly and quietly agreeing to kill Jane's father. The next thing you hear is the original opening, a voiceover from Spacey, as the father, saying, \"My name is Lester Burnham... I am 42 years old. In less than a year I will be dead.\" A whodunnit? </p> <p>The second factor, which made a big difference for many of the actors, was that Mendes, with his theatre background, gave them two weeks' rehearsal. This gave actors, especially the younger ones, time to develop considerable depth and the company a sense of family, which shows in the ensemble of the finished movie. \"We sat around a table for much of the time, because I didn't want them to move. You don't want them to shoot their wad eight weeks before they're in front of the camera. But I was trying to fill up their petrol tanks with emotions and tapping into their imaginations.\" </p> <p>The other smart thing Mendes did was to hire one of the great cinematographers, 72-year-old Conrad L Hall, who won an Oscar for Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid. Mendes simply says of him, \"Conrad is a great man. He embraced my storyboard and made it happen.\" But not immediately. After three days of shooting, Mendes had a crisis: he hated what he had shot. He responded with typical surefootedness.</p> <p> \"Everyone was being too theatrical, telling it to the audience. The thing that was lucky was that I had got everything wrong. I made every wrong artistic choice. If I'd got it just a bit wrong, I might have just tried to adjust a little. But, because it was everything, I said, 'This is not what I wanted it to be.'\" Fortunately, the studio agreed. He asked if he could shoot the scenes all over, and they said yes. \"Frankly, they were relieved that I thought it was crap, too!\" </p> <p>Mendes could now be on the brink of a movie career. However, he will not be moving to Hollywood. \"Nothing that goes on in Hollywood throws anything that goes on here in the shade.\" Mendes loves his Donmar Warehouse. It's family and home. \"I made that film, and went there, because it was an American script. I didn't go to LA saying, 'I must make a film.' It has plot and characters, and is not just another attempt to second-guess the mass audience.\" He is working himself up. For the first time, the quietish, genial air starts to slip. </p> <p>\"I have no desire to live in Hollywood. I found there an industry with thousands and thousands of craftspeople who are simply the best in the world at their job and are prepared to drop their rates for a project they really love. But I am telling you, and I have worked there, we should concentrate on what we do well here.\" It's now a well-argued torrent. </p> <p>\"What's happening here is that newspapers have consistently relegated theatre, ballet, visual arts to the bottom of the page. And always above it is film and rock music. But I'm telling you now, stop obsessing - and this is ironic coming from me - about American film. The Observer film section is 16 pages long, and you have to search through the back pages of the Review to find theatre. And it is advertised as 'What really goes on in Tinseltown'. Who fucking cares? We have so much richness of talent here. And that's why I am back here. Because it's a fucking great place to work.\" </p> <p>For the first time in four years, Mendes has no idea what he is going to do next. There were plans to do Hamlet with Russell Beale, but he had to shelve them because of the film. He was to have directed Sondheim's new musical, Wise Guys, but it's not ready yet. Having directed Kidman on stage, he moves in the movie stratosphere now, with an Oscar nomination a racing certainty. He even spent New Year's Eve on the Cruise/Kidman yacht moored in Sydney harbour. But he will return to Britain to see American Beauty open at the end of this month, and then set about taking the Donmar off in another direction. </p> <p>He has no game plan for the theatre. He is \"a great believer in retrospective policy. Do the play,\" he says, \"and then say it was your policy. Don't make any great announcements. We're very light on our feet at the Donmar. We're a maverick theatre. Always have been.\" And Mendes will certainly be around for the next three years or so to see what his policy was once he's done it. Even if American Beauty wins the Oscar. Which it should. Shouldn't it? Mendes shrugs and smiles contentedly </p>",

Kevin Spacey, co-star with Annette Bening, says, \"People ask, 'How does a thing like Columbine, Colorado happen?' I think this movie answers that question.\" And, somehow, that's nothing like as far-fetched as it might be from another actor about another film. What Spacey means about the Columbine school massacre is that, when the soul becomes a shopping mall, when to live is to own things, it is hardly surprising if kids turn to murder. American Beauty manages to be both hilarious and dark about that crisis in spirit. Through the dissolution of a suburban marriage - by way of boredom, lovelessness and the fact that, when the wife's pruning shears match her gardening gloves, it is no accident - the film suggests there is beauty next to you, that you can reach out and touch it, that people are not what they seem and that everyone's life is infinitely more interesting than they think it is. I should add that the most beautiful sequence in the film is several minutes of a plastic bag blowing in the breeze. And yet the movie is seductive and intelligent, clear-eyed and unsentimental, and tells many stories - of the couple, of their next-door neighbours, of the two children of the two families who find in each other a soulmate, of real estate, of suburbia, of sexual identity, of teen beauty and of murder - confidently cutting from one to another within a deceptively simple framework that defies easy categorisation. Whodunnit? Love Story? Comedy? Teen Angst? Live Action Cartoon? Surreal Fantasy? Or just, The American Condition at the Turn of the Century? Spacey and Bening are the Burnhams. He is a wilfully disillusioned adman, pathetic and admirable in equal part, who whacks off in the shower (the day goes downhill from then on), blackmails his boss when he is sacked and embarrassingly drools over his daughter's best friend. She, on the other hand, is an estate agent and a gloss-painted worshipper at the altar of material achievement. Mid seduction: \"Lester, you're going to spill beer on the couch.\" \"So what? It's just a couch.\" \"This is a four-thousand-dollar sofa upholstered in Italian silk. This is not 'just a couch'.\" Collapse of not only this seduction, but of the prospect of any more, ever. At the heart of the film are the two children, Ricky and Jane, played by Wes Bentley and Thora Birch. The former is certainly a teenage dope dealer and apparently a voyeur, a weirdo who films everything including the girl next door, a dead bird and the signature plastic bag. \"Sometimes,\" he says, \"there's so much beauty in the world I feel like I can't take it... and my heart is going to cave in.\" As Mendes says, \"Ricky is the film's conscience, its soul. At first, you think he is a voyeur, but you realise that Ricky is using his camera to reach out and touch people, not just to record... it's his way of reaching out.\" When talking to Mendes, you do feel that Ricky and he might have much in common. Dark and rather cuddly, with good looks that betray his distant Portuguese ancestry, Mendes is a lot younger-looking than his 34 years. His voice is standard public-school posh, with no concessions to Royal Court street-smart: no aitches dropped, no donkey jackets worn. He is exceptionally polite, softly spoken, not given to excess or exaggeration; only occasionally does he raise his voice. He is warm, yet always gives an impression of self-control, so you could kid yourself that he is unemotional. And there is a certain watchfulness about him, which you might assume in a director, but they're not all like that. The overwhelming impression is that Mendes is very self-contained. When I arrive at the offices of the Donmar Warehouse, he sits for 10 minutes or so at his desk in the open-plan office, completely absorbed in his correspondence, while we, the admin staff and I, gossip like hens in a coop not 10ft away. The actor Simon Russell Beale, one of Mendes's closest collaborators, having played Iago and Ariel for him, recounts one of the rehearsals for the Tempest at the RSC some years ago. \"He stopped the rehearsal because he knew the ending just wasn't working. And then he sat for 45 minutes in the stalls, completely on his own, just thinking. For 45 minutes. You could see his brain working. We were all chatting on the stage. And then he came up with the solution.\" Mendes was born in 1965, an only child. His parents, Peter and Valerie, were a university lecturer and a children's story writer. He went to Magdalen College School in Oxford, then to Cambridge, where he graduated with a first. Despite having staged what he describes as \"several terrible productions\" at university, he speedily got a job at the Chichester Festival Theatre, and within no time at all was running the nascent Minerva Studio for its first season. Then, when he was barely out of shorts, he took over from a senior director who dropped out of a production of London Assurance and graduated to the West End. He had the two hits there by 1989 and was becoming known as something of a wunderkind . He joined the RSC, and in 1992 started to run the Donmar, which he has programmed with an eclectic mix, from Stoppard and Sondheim to Shakespeare. He has encouraged new writing with the Four Corners season (plays drawn from the four countries of the British Isles) and launched into West End successes such as The Rise &amp; Fall Of Little Voice, Company and The Glass Menagerie. The work that Mendes has produced is not grand and conceptual, but draws its impact from his ability to match actor and text. Critics always praise him for finding the sense within plays, rather than looking for spurious relevance or loading them with contemporary devices. What makes him stand out is his clarity of purpose. Russell Beale says of Mendes's first show at the RSC, Troilus &amp; Cressida, \"Sam analysed the pitfalls of young directors needing to show off and completely avoided them. What he did was just very clear and very simple.\" \"You're creating an alternative universe,\" is the way the director himself puts it, \"so you're simply telling a story.\" Apart from his directing, there is an entrepreneurial side to his work. He has been credited with turning the Donmar Warehouse into \"the sexiest theatre in London\", perhaps because he attracts top-rate performers for bottom-rate money. They come to the Donmar for kudos or to reinvent their careers. The success of David Hare's The Blue Room, for example, transformed Mrs Tom Cruise into Nicole Kidman. And, like his contemporary Stephen Daldry, former artistic director of the Royal Court, Mendes' charm and ability to network are considerable. On the other hand, he has no appetite for public campaigning: \"I'll always help the theatre world achieve greater strength, but I don't want to be a spokesperson for the arts.\" He had a longish relationship with the madly talented Jane Horrocks, and was subsequently linked with Calista Flockhart and Rachel Weisz. The casting of Nicole Kidman in an artistically disappointing but publicity heat-seeking production of Hare's play made him noticed further afield than the London theatre world and gave him an aura of glamour. Next thing, he was being asked by Steven Spielberg to make the film everybody is tipping to win this year's Oscar for best picture. All very a,b,c. All very silver-spoon-in-the-mouth. But hardly predictable, even for a middle-class, privileged boy, who plays cricket in Harold Pinter's cricket team, The Gaieties. What fascinates about Mendes is his preter- natural confidence. How can you direct Judi Dench at 23? How can you deal with Spielberg on your first film? How do you make such clear choices in life and in art? He stumbles in his answer. \"I am very resistant... there are so many things going through... I don't think there is one thing in particular. You're forced to come up with key moments that kind of spur you on and then you begin to believe them yourself. Directing is such a strange thing to do with your life.\" There is the sense behind everything he says that his own palpable solitariness, within his charming and clubbable exterior, is not up for examination. Yet he seems to have put it on screen in American Beauty. \"There's no doubt that I found myself drawn to the script because I felt very personal about it. Directing is a very solitary job, in the sense that you never meet other directors. One of the things about running this building is that I get to see other directors work, so I am always learning.\" But he's only 34, and he has already achieved an enormous amount. How does he do it? Not just by watching others. \"There is nothing in my upbringing that explains why I do what I do.\" And then he says later, \"A great deal of it is buried in my youth. I was very bad academically at school. I didn't concentrate. I scraped through my O-levels and just got into sixth form, and then decided that, 'Hang on, I'd better take control of my own life.' I don't like talking about this much, because I feel responsible to my parents. I find it unfair to them.\" It is a matter of record that his parents divorced when he was five. But he elaborates and says, \"My life was turned upside down on many occasions, to the point where, if I didn't take control of my life, I would have just taken a lot of drugs or something.\" And then he says, \"the periods of calm and the periods of turmoil with each of my parents were the single most determining thing of my childhood. I took control of my life when I was 16 and kind of said, 'Stuff that. I am not going to depend on anyone else again.' Nothing can compete with the fear that everything stable in your life is out of control. Nothing's frightening after that. Not even Cameron Mackintosh!\" So he spent his childhood being a skilled cricketer, watching movies and reading, sheltering from the uncertainty. He says he was \"a troubled fantasist who told stories to himself\". But, in the midst of it all, he seems to have developed one skill, alongside his confidence and the decision to take control of his life. He is remarkably relaxed one-to-one. \"I mainly spent my life,\" he explains, \"with one other person, my mother.\" And this has lead to a great ability with actors. \"I love actors; I have great respect for them.\" He has unlimited willingness to communicate with them precisely in a way that they understand. \"I will go out and find what they need. My language to each of them has to suit their brain.\" Russell Beale tells a story: \"He stayed with me in Stratford during the technical run of Troilus &amp; Cressida, and I saw him one night with his notebook. He had just scrawled things like 'shit' or 'crap' or 'wrong' quickly during the run-through. But then he spent hours at night sitting up translating each point differently into something each actor could understand.\" Mendes knows this about himself. \"I am not a masterclass director,\" he says. \"I am not a teacher. I am a coach. I don't have a methodology. Each actor is different. And on a film set you have to be next to them all, touching them on the shoulder saying, 'I'm with you. I know exactly how you're working. Now try this or that...'\" He illustrates: \"Kevin Spacey likes to joke and piss about and do impersonations right up to the moment of action, on his mobile phone to his agent or whatever. The more relaxed, the more jovial he is, the more he's not thinking about what he does. When you say, 'Action', he's like a laser beam. His relaxation leads to spontaneity. So to Kevin you're saying, 'Give me a Walter Matthau impersonation.'\" Annette Bening, on the other hand, \"is on her Walkman half-an-hour before the cameras roll, cutting off the set, focused down, listening to music that the character would listen to\". His conclusion on his own method is simple: \"All I know is that I operate by going out to each of them and trying to learn the territory in which they operate.\" The script for American Beauty really came to him thanks to two productions: Oliver! and Cabaret. Spielberg had seen Oliver! in London and says now that \"it was a visual candy-store, and I sort of banked his name in my mind\". In 1998, Mendes's production of Cabaret opened in a converted nightclub in New York, and the producers of American Beauty, Bruce Cohen and Dan Jinks, saw it, as did Spielberg, whose company Dreamworks had just bought Alan Ball's script, then titled American Rose, from them. There were other directors' names in the frame, but Spielberg approached Mendes, asking him to lunch. \"I stuffed my face while he sipped a mud-coloured health shake,\" says Mendes. He read Ball's screenplay and was immediately taken. \"It was incredibly multi-layered, but it made me laugh. Then I read it again, and it was full of sadness and loneliness, about imprisonment and escape. Then there was this theme of beauty running through it, and it was so many different things and I just didn't know how Alan [Ball] had done it. And that really fascinated me.\" He storyboarded the whole film during the run of Blue Room at the Donmar. He had very clear ideas about what it should look like. When you hear him say, \"I enter things visually before I enter them emotionally\", it explains much of his work in the theatre, its completeness and unity of style and text. At times, the look of American Beauty has the remorselessly logical illogicality of a Magritte. There is a moment when the young cheerleader, with whom Lester has decided he is in love, opens her blouse and scores of rose petals cascade out. At another moment, she is submerged in a bath full of them. At these moments, a touch of the surreal hovers a foot above the real. But at other times, the film has the still symmetry of an Edward Hopper. \"I wanted a very composed, peaceful visual style to tell a story that was full of emotional tumult,\" he says. \"And I realised, when I was cutting it, that I had made an even more emotional film than I thought I was making. In fact, the film I read, the film I thought I was making, and the film I actually made, are three different things.\" It was an immaculate script by Ball, a co-executive producer and writer on the sitcom Cybill and co-writer of Grace Under Fire. But it was honed during filming. First, in editing, Mendes managed both to guide the story and to throw the audience a loop. For instance, he added an opening pre-title scene to create the first of several McGuffins, as Hitchcock called red herrings, in which the kids are filmed solemnly and quietly agreeing to kill Jane's father. The next thing you hear is the original opening, a voiceover from Spacey, as the father, saying, \"My name is Lester Burnham... I am 42 years old. In less than a year I will be dead.\" A whodunnit? The second factor, which made a big difference for many of the actors, was that Mendes, with his theatre background, gave them two weeks' rehearsal. This gave actors, especially the younger ones, time to develop considerable depth and the company a sense of family, which shows in the ensemble of the finished movie. \"We sat around a table for much of the time, because I didn't want them to move. You don't want them to shoot their wad eight weeks before they're in front of the camera. But I was trying to fill up their petrol tanks with emotions and tapping into their imaginations.\" The other smart thing Mendes did was to hire one of the great cinematographers, 72-year-old Conrad L Hall, who won an Oscar for Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid. Mendes simply says of him, \"Conrad is a great man. He embraced my storyboard and made it happen.\" But not immediately. After three days of shooting, Mendes had a crisis: he hated what he had shot. He responded with typical surefootedness. \"Everyone was being too theatrical, telling it to the audience. The thing that was lucky was that I had got everything wrong. I made every wrong artistic choice. If I'd got it just a bit wrong, I might have just tried to adjust a little. But, because it was everything, I said, 'This is not what I wanted it to be.'\" Fortunately, the studio agreed. He asked if he could shoot the scenes all over, and they said yes. \"Frankly, they were relieved that I thought it was crap, too!\" Mendes could now be on the brink of a movie career. However, he will not be moving to Hollywood. \"Nothing that goes on in Hollywood throws anything that goes on here in the shade.\" Mendes loves his Donmar Warehouse. It's family and home. \"I made that film, and went there, because it was an American script. I didn't go to LA saying, 'I must make a film.' It has plot and characters, and is not just another attempt to second-guess the mass audience.\" He is working himself up. For the first time, the quietish, genial air starts to slip. \"I have no desire to live in Hollywood. I found there an industry with thousands and thousands of craftspeople who are simply the best in the world at their job and are prepared to drop their rates for a project they really love. But I am telling you, and I have worked there, we should concentrate on what we do well here.\" It's now a well-argued torrent. \"What's happening here is that newspapers have consistently relegated theatre, ballet, visual arts to the bottom of the page. And always above it is film and rock music. But I'm telling you now, stop obsessing - and this is ironic coming from me - about American film. The Observer film section is 16 pages long, and you have to search through the back pages of the Review to find theatre. And it is advertised as 'What really goes on in Tinseltown'. Who fucking cares? We have so much richness of talent here. And that's why I am back here. Because it's a fucking great place to work.\" For the first time in four years, Mendes has no idea what he is going to do next. There were plans to do Hamlet with Russell Beale, but he had to shelve them because of the film. He was to have directed Sondheim's new musical, Wise Guys, but it's not ready yet. Having directed Kidman on stage, he moves in the movie stratosphere now, with an Oscar nomination a racing certainty. He even spent New Year's Eve on the Cruise/Kidman yacht moored in Sydney harbour. But he will return to Britain to see American Beauty open at the end of this month, and then set about taking the Donmar off in another direction. He has no game plan for the theatre. He is \"a great believer in retrospective policy. Do the play,\" he says, \"and then say it was your policy. Don't make any great announcements. We're very light on our feet at the Donmar. We're a maverick theatre. Always have been.\" And Mendes will certainly be around for the next three years or so to see what his policy was once he's done it. Even if American Beauty wins the Oscar. Which it should. Shouldn't it? Mendes shrugs and smiles contentedly",

Every technology has had its literary Cassandra. The onset of the cinema was greeted with horror by F R Leavis, for example. For T S Eliot, part of being the harbinger of modernism was to have a horrified fascination with machine culture. And to W B Yeats - even though he fancied himself a \"clockwork nightingale\" in his poem \"Sailing to Byzantium\" - all machines, even the printing press, were anathema. </p> <p>But at the sharp, local end of writing, things mechanical were already moving on apace. Eliot's sometime collaborator, Ezra Pound, had discovered the virtues of the typewriter in the staccato modulations of imagist poetry. Today, we can say that the computer, like Pound's qwertyuiop before it, has had a discernible material effect on the English language over the past decade. </p> <p>We might talk, for instance, of the effect of block moves on narrative prose, of editorial cut-and-paste and other manoeuvres. But the greatest effect of the computer has been sheer prolixity, as more and more words are tumbled out - often with far less thought than before. Nowhere is this more apparent than on the internet. </p> <p>Photocopying and faxes speeded up the verbal economy, but that is nothing to what is happening in the digital network society. How will works of literature adapt? Is this the era of what Michael Heim, author of The Metaphysics of Virtual Reality, has called \"frictionless writing\"? Frictionless in the sense that ideas flow directly onto the screen with little of the mediation traditionally associated with literary art.</p> <p>But what if the internet were really a fantastic opportunity for writers, not just as a reference tool, but as a publishing medium and imaginative resource? Far from being the gateway to pixellated vacancy, the computer screen and the other \"windows\" playing upon it might provide enlightenment for writers and readers alike. </p> <p>It is an enticing prospect, but in an infomaniac world, it's as wise to be sober. People do \"publish\" things on the net: but can you call even the best of it \"literature\"? Can you, at a time when copyright is under threat from unpoliceable electronic duplication, even call it \"publishing\"? It may be that literary value, at best a slippery concept, really has no place at all in the digital age. </p> <p>Yet companies such as Online Originals, BiblioBytes and Massachusetts software house Eastgate Systems are now offering first-time publication on the net (though why not just do it yourself?). In Patricia le Roy's The Angels of Russia, last year's Booker Prize accepted its first electronic submission. BT has launched the search for the first e-laureate, while the Gutenberg Project continues to commit the texts of literary classics to the internet. </p> <p>Authors such as Ruth Rendell and John Updike have begun novels on the net to be completed by others. Both ventures took the form of competitions, with up to 16,000 people offering contributions to Updike's novel daily. On Amazon.com and its UK subsidiary, you can pick up readers' \"literary criticism\", while online magazines such as Slate and Salon offer classy writing that is often bought up and repackaged by old-fashioned print media. </p> <p>It seems, then, as if there is an explosion of interest in electronic literature - but getting a handle on what is actually useful and valuable about it remains difficult. Perhaps the best strategy is to look at other moments of great change in printing and publishing. </p> <p>Chief among these would be the publication of Gutenberg's Bible (c. 1456), Caxton's Recuyell of the Historyes of Troye (1474), and Tyndale's New Testament (1525). The most significant development was not a publication at all, but the lapse of the licensing act of 1697 - before which anything that was to printed had to be submitted to the monopoly of the Stationer's Company. Later came the copyright act of 1710, which for the first time vested legal ownership of the text in the author. </p> <p>Out of this brief history comes the lesson that political and theological control were more important than technical advances. It was a century after Caxton made it technically feasible that the Bible was allowed to be printed in English. Tyndale, its first translator, was harried and eventually killed for his work. </p> <p>The significance of these developments for the internet today is that it all comes down to authority: who will determine what reaches the public and arrange it into a hierarchy of value? In the electronic era, the answer seems to be: anyone at all. </p> <p>It sounds nicely democratic, but the fact is that literature, and the establishment of the canon which bodies out that word, has nearly always been the preserve of a minority whose Leavisite \"scrutiny\" has determined which works have lasted and which have been discarded. </p> <p>However unfashionable it may sound, it is still true that people need \"authority\" to avoid information overload and low-quality material. There are other issues, including the transmission of dangerous, inflammatory and subversive material. These questions of authority will be one of the main factors that the net has to address. </p> <p>One of the ways in which literary authority was exercised in the past was reviewing, ever since Dr Johnson took his seat in St John's Gatehouse on London's Clerkenwell Road - in a building which would, ironically, later become home of the Times Literary Supplement. Johnson was contributing to Edmund Cave's Gentleman's Magazine. Founded in 1731, it was a miscellany (actually giving us the word \"magazine\", from its earlier sense of \"storehouse\"), with most of its articles, except for Johnson's reviews, filched from elsewhere. This is certainly one area in which the internet is returning to its roots (Cave was the Rupert Murdoch of his time, a millionaire and the first media baron), insofar as the abstraction, sampling and revamping of text is a mainstay of electronic journalism. </p> <p>But what about literature, when \"content\" is laden, for better or worse, with apparently ineffable values? Will the new technology, like other social changes before it, enable new genres or works of art - in the same way that the growth of the Elizabethan playhouses (and new laws permitting public entertainment) enabled Shakespeare, or the exponential increase in literacy during the Industrial Revolution enabled the growth of the novel? </p> <p>Although its length means it is fated never to be an electronic genre, the novel is certainly one of the art forms which, in works such as William Gibson's Neuromancer and many others, has capitalised on the imaginative possibilities of cyberspace and virtual reality. Even poetry, most Parnassian of genres, has drawn on the metaphor of the computer in the work of writers such as Paul Muldoon, John Burnside and Cahal Dallat. Douglas Coupland, meanwhile, has in his novel Microserfs chronicled the lifestyles and psychology of the Silicon Valley generation. </p> <p>If there is to be a genuine electronic literary genre, it will be heavily circumscribed by attention span. No one will read on screen, in comfort, anything much longer than 800 words. About 250 to 400 words seems more realistic. Forget epics, we're talking epigrams, Beckettian dramaticules, or prose poems following the model of Baudelaire and Rimbaud. </p> <p>Verse itself doesn't seem much of a runner, as free-flowing text seems to militate against fixed line-endings: there is always \"the glyph\", the moment when the machine seems to take over. In other contexts, however - such as the manipulation of narrative outcomes by artificial intelligence in conjunction with reader interaction - the glyph (the term comes from an engraving process) might just be a benefit. </p> <p>Hypertext fiction, whereby a choice of links determines patterns of story, seems a positive, Shandyesque way to go. But it is still an emergent form. It is also very clumsy, although the development of Storyspace, a new program by Eastgate Systems, looks promising. </p> <p>The style of any important author to emerge from the internet seems likely to be both gnomic and cultic. He or she will become famous from the grass roots, as more people hit the hallowed site. Though they will soon pick up on the word of mouth, or word of mouse, publishers and newspapers, those traditional arbiters of literary taste, will get there too late. </p> <p>Most internet authors, however, will remain obscure. Though there is, one supposes, always the chance of revival and fame in posterity, based perhaps on a new bibliographical specialism in the retrieval of dead texts from hard disks and long-forgotten network loops. </p> <p>One cult author from the past who laboured without recognition all his life was William Blake, and his example in illustrating his own poems gives us another clue as to what might happen to literature on the net - the emergence of a kind of multitasking author, adept not just in hypertext mark-up language and Java (the languages used to create web pages) but in a host of dynamic animation techniques for manipulating both words and images. This person is more likely to emerge from the field of computer games than from traditional literary proving grounds. </p> <p>Whether these moving illuminated manuscripts will be called literature is debatable. The key point is that convergence between technologies will go hand in hand with a collapsing of divisions between art forms - just as, in the academy, various disciplines have begun to collapse into Cultural Studies. </p> <p>One person's collapse, however, is another's hypertext link - a creative opportunity, in other words - and if it remains true that people won't stop reading the printed book in the near future, it is also true that they will avail themselves of whatever the internet might produce. And where readers go, authors will follow, taking advantage of whatever technology can effect the transaction. Even that high priest of reaction T S Eliot, after all, came round to the loudspeaker in the end, recording The Waste Land for posterity in his thin, reedy voice.</p>",

I rang the publisher for news on \"the Swiss novel,\" and there wasn't any. Faber hadn't done any books from the German, not for a long time, and kept no tabs on German translators - or perhaps the translators took fright at this epic set on a dairy farm and an abattoir, about the cow, Blosch, and the Spanish Gastarbeiter, Ambrosio, about milk, and about blood.

It was fully five years since the German edition, and I didn't want to waste any more time. The earliest possible date was a Monday in October, 1988; some voices counselled against, suggesting waiting till January, but I was full of the book and unafraid of anything.

The FQ is still a gap in my reading (and not just mine), but at least I and others intimidated by its inordinate length can take comfort in the knowledge that Spenser wrote other stuff, all of it shorter - and all of it in this volume. So, as to relevance: well, messages of impending disaster, or warnings of the reversals that fate has in store for everyone on earth, are always going to be relevant; and the first 22 poems here, which come under the general title \"A Theatre for Worldlings\", catalogue the visions Spenser had of beauty being torn apart, wealth and power being laid waste; not just warnings about the uselessness of vanity and deserved destruction, but of the way everything in this world, good or bad, is torn down.

There is love poetry, occasionally astonishing (\"Venomous toung tipt with vile adders sting,/ . . . from which a spring/ of poyusoned words and spiteful speeches well . . .\" - you will notice the original spelling is kept, we're not being treated like idiots here), translations from Petrarch, and everything you might expect from the man who, had Shakespeare not lived, would be the country's equal number one poet, along with Chaucer. So there you go. You now have no excuse not to have an edition of Spenser in the house.",

      "body": "<p>Every now and again, some television producer rummages through the archives of University Challenge for ancient contests featuring now-famous people. Seeing a hirsute Clive James or a slender Stephen Fry being youthful and brilliant is always good value viewing. Marina Warner was at Oxford in the mid-60s and also appeared on a television quiz show. But she was not quizzed by a brightly earnest Bamber Gascoigne for the honour of her college. Instead the young Marina, a student of French and Italian, the first female editor of Isis, and, it was said, the prettiest undergraduate of her generation, was confronted by the gurning features of Hughie Green, and she competed for hard cash. </p> <p>The programme Double Your Money (the Who Wants to be a Millionaire of its day), had sent a team of researchers to Oxford to recruit young contestants. \"But they never did it again,\" laughs Warner, who chose Greek myths as her subject. \"The questions were so elementary that we all cleaned up.\" </p> <p>The actress Diana Quick was a contemporary and remembers it well. \"She was on week after week. The show would start with Marina in this glass booth and Hughie Green would ask her, 'do you want to double your money'? She eventually got up to \u00a3500 before she stopped, which was very acute because she knew the next question would be impossible. It was a fortune. I was living on \u00a310 a week and I could comfortably run a car and a flat on that. She took the money and went to Paris for the weekend. It seemed unutterably glamorous when she came back wearing a blue fun-fur coat and carrying a basket of oysters.\" </p> <p>Looking back, Warner's interest in myths and her stylish facility for applying high learning to low culture provided a pretty big clue as to her future direction. Ever since, as novelist, teacher, polemicist and cultural historian, her work has consistently circled round the same linked areas: how myths, fairy tales and symbolism continue to resonate in modern culture, the role of iconography in our lives, and the representation of women. </p> <p>\"What is amazing about Marina is that she is, in the quintessential European sense of the term, a brilliant intellectual,\" says the publisher Carmen Callil. \"But what makes her so interesting is that she eternally applies her material to everyday things and life as it is now. Her connections are so exciting and relevant that they allow you completely to relate to what she is saying\". </p> <p>That is not to say that either her subject matter or her approach meets with universal approval. Following the publication of her book about fairy tales, From The Beast to the Blonde, the historian Noel Malcolm mocked: \"Once upon a time, there was a very clever girl called Marina,\" he wrote, \"who read lots and lots of books. Every book seemed to connect up with every other book, and they all told her something about images of womanhood in cultural history.\" </p> <p>Camille Paglia, who, like Warner, is also often described as an academic feminist cultural critic, offers little sisterly support. \"She's a slick socialite with a sentimental ladies' magazine sensibility,\" claims Paglia. \"Neither I, nor anyone I know, takes her seriously.\" </p> <p>But many other academics are more generous. Marilyn Butler has praised Warner's ability to unearth \"genuine topics\". Gillian Beer has called her, \"a rare bird indeed, the freelance writer of considerable powers, not caught up in the academic web\". Roy Foster, Carroll Professor of Irish History at Hertford College, Oxford, and biographer of Yeats, has known her for more than 20 years. </p> <p>\"She's rated very highly indeed [as an academic]. But she prefers to be an independent scholar than to hold an academic post, which would be hers for the asking. It has enabled her to write more and to write over a wider range. She's had a more successful life as an independent scholar than is the norm. She is a phenomenon in that way.\" </p> <p>This month sees the publication of the paperback edition of her book No Go the Bogeyman. While From the Beast to the Blonde majored on representations of feminine evil in fairy tales, Warner says this book began, \"with the problem of men\". In it she explores the forms and functions of ogres ancient and modern. This meandering journey into our fears and the \"strategies of imagination\" we employ to face and, hopefully, overcome them, starts with a piece about cannibalism and ends with a marvellous chapter on bananas. There are endless intriguing oddities, such as the mayor of Bogota dressing his traffic police as clowns to defuse an epidemic of road rage - it apparently worked. </p> <p>The book shows her seemingly all-embracing geographical and historical sweep of understanding of the world and appreciation of the forces that shape it. When Ursula le Guin reviewed the book of her 1994 BBC Reith Lectures, Six Myths of our Time, she noted with awe that Warner's thinking on the contemporary uses and dimensions of fiction, myth and the imagination, \"takes her from Keats to King Kong to cannibalism, from welfare mothers to male bonding to child pornography to patriotism\". </p> <p> It is no real surprise then that, despite her fiercely clipped accent and almost archetypal English-establishment lineage - the Warner stand at Lord's cricket ground is named after her grandfather, Sir Pelham - parochialism was programmed out of Marina from the beginning. She was born in London, but brought up in Cairo by her Italian mother, Emilia, and English father, Esmond. She has a younger sister, Laura, who is now an art critic. </p> <p>During the war Esmond Warner had been in the 8th Army in Egypt. He was in the same regiment as the owner of WH Smith, and Warner, impressed by the cosmopolitan and literary atmosphere of Cairo, suggested that a bookshop would thrive there. WH Smith agreed and Esmond opened up a wholesaler for them in the city. </p> <p>\"Of course we were expats and colonials,\" explains Marina, \"but from a child's point of view it was very glamorous. We could see the pyramids from our terrace. I remember being too small to climb up and being helped up on to these huge stones. We holidayed in Alexandria in the summer. We overlooked the Nile and used to watch the boats. I remember my parents going out a great deal with my father in a dinner jacket and mother in very fancy dresses.\" </p> <p>In what sounds like a neatly prophetic tableau of her glitzy literary life to come, in the evenings she would sit between her father, who was reading the Times Literary Supplement, and her mother, thumbing through Vogue. She enjoyed gossiping in \"kitchen Italian\" with the servants, and expresses some pride that she had a black nanny from the Sudan when so many other expat families \"shipped in white nannies from England\". </p> <p>However, the Egyptian idyll ended in 1952 when the family were forced to leave after her father's warehouse was burned down in the first nationalist riots. Warner recalls her father being \"devastated\" by the fire and his despair being transmitted to the rest of the family. She has not returned to Egypt since, although when she was recently in Israel she says she had a rather \"Proustian moment\", when listening to the sounds of an Arab market: \"I felt an incredible happiness.\" </p> <p>The colourful Cairo social scene also brought the family into contact with some louchely exotic figures. A close friend was the spy Donald Maclean, who worked at the embassy. Warner recalls: \"When he vanished my mother visited his wife in the London clinic where she had just had an operation. My mother was saying how ghastly it all was and Melinda Maclean was lying there saying it was all awful and she couldn't believe it. The next day she had gone too. She had this perfect front.\" </p> <p>Another family friend is Lord Longford, who was at prep school with Marina's father and is her godfather. \"My father was a rather tweedy type who thumped his Daily Telegraph throughout the 60s and 70s [complaining] about the unions and Harold Wilson,\" Warner says. \"So you can imagine his chagrin that first of all his closest friend should become a socialist, but then also a Catholic. But they remained fast friends. </p> <p>\"My father used to chuckle a lot about it. 'Ha ha, what is Frank up to now with another murderess?', stuff like that. [Longford] really does believe in the sinner who repents. I once heard an Egyptian woman saying to him that she thought it was rather good that thieves had their hands cut off under Sharia law. I thought this was going to kill him.\" </p> <p>Although Esmond Warner was an Anglican, he was happy that Marina should be brought up Catholic, as it was, \"a good religion for a girl\". By which he meant, explains Warner, \"that it was demure and chaste and ladylike\". She now say she is \"bored\" with her Catholicism, \"I wish I could invent another family romance.\" </p> <p>But while she left the church long ago, its mind-set still exerts a powerful tug. \"I've read a lot of the Pope's writings. He is very good at bringing an audience to him by picturing how the meek shall inherit the earth, and then suddenly these strictures will come out focused upon women's bodies. </p> <p>\"I have a theory that his obsessive anxiety about the unborn is to do with the church's guilt about the Holocaust. I think the unborn children, these non-existent people, are standing in for the real 20th century ghosts who were the people not helped by the church. It is important that he comes from Poland. It reads to me like a psychological switch from one lot of hauntings to another.\" </p> <p>After the family returned from Cairo they had a short spell in London before moving to Brussels. Marina was sent to the convent of St Mary's in Ascot, and has awful memories of commuting. \"They put a sign saying 'unaccompanied minor' round my neck, and as it always seemed to be foggy at Heathrow I would have to stay for days on end with these distant acquaintances who would have to put me up until the fog lifted.\" </p> <p>Sister Christina Kenworthy Browne taught Warner and recalls her as, \"very clever in a very gifted class. Sarah Hogg was in the same year, but [Warner] was the sort of child whose work you wanted to look at first, you knew it would be interesting. She also had a deep sense of the spiritual. She was interested in symbolism and so on even then. Her troubled Catholicism wasn't evident at school but I think it was boiling underneath.\" </p> <p>In Egypt, Warner had spoken French at school and only spoke English to adults. \"So I was quite badly teased for this stilted way of speaking. I had no school idiom or slang at all and must have sounded horribly pompous.\" And although not initially happy there - when her old headmistress recently died she still had \"mixed feelings\" read ing the obituary in the Times - she grew used to school and began to love some subjects. </p> <p>\"And I was well taught. It did shape me intellectually, and it probably enhanced my feeling for paintings, because as a religion it does love a graven image. But I had lots of struggles with faith. The whole thing was a struggle with a lot of talk about sexual liberation, although that is a phrase that sounds as though it should be in an antique box now.\" </p> <p>Warner went up to Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford at 17, which she now thinks was too young. Diana Quick remembers her as, \"very stylish and confident, and as she knew lots of people before she came up she had a ready-made social circle. While she had a great time socially, she always had a phenomenal capacity for hard work. I remember an edition of Isis she did with an amazing golden cover which was fantastically glamorous for a university rag.\" </p> <p>Tariq Ali was head of the Oxford Union, and the Monty Python crowd were a few years ahead of her, but she says for the most part she found Oxford stifling. \"They weren't used to undergraduates who were modern women, and the sense of decorum was oppressive. It was assumed that any woman who was interested in clothes must be a silly goose. Now one is used to meeting a woman with a first in philosophy wearing the latest nose ring, or whatever. In those days if you went to a tutorial in a mini skirt it meant you weren't serious about study.\" </p> <p>After university she was offered a job on the Daily Telegraph, where she won an award for young journalist of the year before moving on, aged 23, to be the features editor on Vogue. She interviewed the 60s guru, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, and the artist MC Escher. As the house photographers were Snowdon, Bailey and Beaton, getting high-profile subjects was no problem. \"And all I really had to do was write an extended photo caption,\" Warner says. \"It was wonderful.\" </p> <p>At this time she wrote her first novel, but it was rejected by Cecil Day Lewis, then at Chatto &amp; Windus. \"He called me in and said it was good but not good enough to publish. He suggested I try non-fiction.\" Her first book was a biography of the last Chinese Empress, Tz'u-Hsi, chosen because she had always been interested in Chinese culture. In a very Warner-esque way she was originally turned on to it by all that odd Chinoiserie in the Rupert Bear cartoon strip. </p> <p>She eventually left Vogue in 1971 to go to America with her boyfriend, the journalist William Shawcross, whom she had met at Oxford. \"I had to get married to go with him,\" she explains. \"We wouldn't have got married unless we had to, for practical reasons, but also I didn't want to give up my job without some sort of security, so I suppose in that sense I was a bourgeois.\" </p> <p>Shawcross was writing speeches for Senator Edward Kennedy, but soon the Watergate story erupted, ultimately to bring down President Nixon. A Sunday Times team arrived to stay at their flat, and the journalistic orgy commenced. \"William was incredibly excited but I was pretty much left to my own devices,\" she remembers. \"So I spent hours in the Library of Congress reading around eight books a day on the Virgin Mary for my book about the Mary cult, Alone of All Her Sex. I wasn't exactly miserable. I just didn't have anything else to do.\" </p> <p>Warner then went with Shawcross to Vietnam, where she witnessed the aftermath of the napalm raid on Trang Bang and actually saw the horribly burned girl captured in the now-famous photograph. While there her research into the model of womanhood thrown up by Mariolatry increasingly became a painful personal voyage of discovery. \"The religion I had absorbed and discarded was very different to what I found in the history, in that the cult of Mary had changed so much over the years and served so many purposes.\" </p> <p>In 1977 their son, Conrad, was born. (He is currently taking an MA in sculpture at the Slade school of art.) But the marriage broke down a couple of years later, and in 1981, Warner married the painter John Dewe Mathews in a Catholic ceremony abetted by Cardinal Hume, who had been Mathews' housemaster at Ampleforth. </p> <p>This second marriage ended three years ago. \"It was obviously painful but it was the right thing to do,\" she says. \"We'd been married a long time and we had changed. We didn't have any children, which was a great sadness. We both expected to have children, and it was an incredible surprise to me, who spent most of my youth desperately avoiding getting pregnant. I think he is probably better off now, but he is a very gentle man and he wouldn't have done it himself.\" </p> <p>Warner's new partner is Nick Groom, an English lecturer at the University of Exeter, at 33 some 20 years her junior. \"I was very surprised when we got together,\" she says. \"I thought he was a young friend. But now we squabble like an old married couple.\" </p> <p>There have been other changes to her life in recent years. In political terms her impeccable north London liberal activism - she was on the committee of management of the National Council for One-Parent Families, and a leading member of Charter 88 - has been shaken. She was a member of CND and \"hung on until Greenham Common was decommissioned. I received these awfully Xeroxed sheets from the rump of the Kentish Town branch right until the end.\" But now she confesses to being baffled as to whether CND was actually beneficial. </p> <p>\"It was clearly very damaging to the Labour Party, and contributed to its failure. They might have made more headway earlier if they hadn't had such a CND policy. And we might not have had some of the things that have happened under the Conservatives. In some awful way [the Bomb] did seem to have kept the peace. But I had a Bertrand Russell view that it was a wicked thing in itself, and one should not espouse wickedness.\" </p> <p>She is attempting to incorporate these themes of confusion - \"not political analysis but the human landscape\" - in a new novel she is working on. \"I find that if I read in the New York Review of Books a piece about how we should go into Kosovo with a land army I'm completely convinced. And then I read somewhere else that it's a disgraceful act of colonisation and imperialism for our trade benefits, and I'm equally convinced.\" </p> <p>Carmen Callil places her among the leading trinity of British female writers. \"At one time I was publish ing Marina, Antonia Byatt and Angela Carter. They each delivered a new book at about the same time and they were all about fairy stories. When Angie died I told Marina that now her workload would be quintupled. She'd have to do everything that Angie did, as well as all her own stuff. But she has been marvellous. One day she will write a really great novel.\" </p> <p>Warner suspects she has entirely different readerships for her fiction and non-fiction but has recently begun to see her work as a series of diptychs. Her first novel, In a Dark Wood, written in 1977, came out after the Virgin Mary book, and featured a vision of Mary when a man has a crisis of faith after falling in love with a boy. \"I was dramatising my own departure from Catholicism,\" she now sees. \"The main thing I disputed was its attitude to sexuality.\" </p> <p> She then wrote about the various appropriations of the Joan of Arc myth, while in her next novel, The Skating Party, an anthropologist comes across a young girl who has been declared a witch. \"She was a modern Joan of Arc and the anthropologist was a 20th century inquisitor. It was a different way of standing back and seeing evil done.\" </p> <p>In 1988 her third novel, The Lost Father, was placed on an extremely strong Booker shortlist. The winner was Peter Carey's Oscar and Lucinda but Warner shared the stage with Bruce Chatwin, David Lodge, Penelope Fitzgerald and Salman Rushdie, whose entry was Satanic Verses. </p> <p>To carry on the diptych idea, The Lost Father can be seen as a companion to her book about state language, Monuments and Maidens, in which she explores how women are used to personify the state and ideas of the state, liberty being one example. In The Lost Father, a family saga set in Italy, women acting as the guardians of the fatherland collude in the \"romancing of eternal patriarchal figures\". </p> <p>It was written after the death of her father, when she realised that she had never really spoken to him. \"I hadn't talked to him enough about his life and what he felt about things. I was too young, antagonistic and hostile. We'd always end up having a fight about Arthur Scargill instead of me asking him any interesting questions. </p> <p>\"I still regret that, so I made sure I did ask my mother about her life. She had been transplanted from Italy, and I told her I'd seen newsreel footage of when Mussolini asked women to give up their wedding rings as part of the war effort in Abyssinia and they got a ring of iron in return. It turns out my mother went with my grandmother to do this.\" </p> <p>Roy Foster calls her fiction \"mightily impressive. I'm very fond of The Lost Father and admire her next novel, Indigo, hugely. It was a very brave book to write and very successful in its own terms. She was entering a territory which is highly contested, where all sorts of people have territorial claims; that is the territory of race. But she occupied it with integrity and grace and imagination.\" Indigo, set on a magical Caribbean island, draws on The Tempest to dissect colonialism, exploitation and slavery. </p> <p>Warner was particularly delighted when the poet and Nobel laureate Derek Walcott praised the novel. She has proudly kept the notes he used when introducing her at a reading in St Lucia. \"They are in this beautiful handwriting with bits of paper stuck all over it as he worked on it. It is a wonderful document.\" </p> <p>She acknowledges that her fiction, written in a poeticised language, is not very fashionable - \"It comes from my background with French and Italian and is not influenced by American minimalism\" - and worries at the lottery that sales of literary fiction can be. \"You might put 10 years work into a book and it will sell 500 copies.\" </p> <p>So she continues in her self-defined role. Public intellectual? Independent scholar? \"I prefer just to be called a writer,\" she says. \"At one time I did want to be attached to an institution. But I've changed my view dramatically, as I think I have now broken through and people don't despise me any more. They used to use the term 'Vogue journalist' as an insult and I wanted to be enfolded and enclosed. I wanted people to say I could be one of them. But now I'm loaded with honorary doctorates and that recognition is comforting.\" She is presented with another one today from the Tavistock Clinic, the renowned school of mental health training, research and scholarship. </p> <p>Warner says that the single event that most contributed to this acceptance was when she delivered the 1994 BBC Reith Lectures, only the second woman in 47 years to do so. Her series of talks, Managing Monsters: Six Myths Of Our Time, was a culmination of her work at the time, and the subsequent book has become a set text on cultural studies courses. </p> <p>Liz Forgan was managing director of BBC radio at the time. \"Marina's extremely original way of seeing straight to the heart of contemporary culture through the prism of myth and ancient stories was perfect for us,\" she says. \"And the reaction showed me that we were completely correct in finding a truly original voice. Half the world thought it was wonderful and opened doors that they had always known were there but hadn't thought to open. The other half hated it and thought it was just the wrong womany sound. I was delighted about that.\" </p> <p>Warner recalls it as \"real head-above-the-parapet stuff, which I don't usually have much stomach for. But I do realise that sometimes you need Janet Daley to say it is all meretricious claptrap. You can't expect to be bland and for everyone to just worship and admire your argument. I have kept my head down to a large extent as I think that, rather than get into spats, you should put all that energy into work. </p> <p>\"My only reservation is that it is a bit of cowardice sometimes. If you look at literary history, it is these rows that changed minds and directions. We have a bit of a tame circle of spite, in which some people write bad reviews about other people. That is not the same as a precipitating a real debate about what fiction, or memoirs, or history should be doing.\" </p> <p>In what appears to be something of a departure, she is currently studying various aspects of psychic research: \"There are some very distinguished physicists who say that not all the problems have been solved: the known has expanded, but there is still a lot unknown. Some of them are fairly interested in psychic stuff. </p> <p>\"In fact while the bogeyman material is a certain literary strand of a representation of the unknown, there is a parallel strand that comes out of the scientific enquiry culture. They're not exactly woven together, but they do keep step together, in a way. It all provides clues\". </p> <p>An enhanced appreciation of the cultural currents that have shaped the world may equip us better to change that world. \"Updike called fairy tales beach glass, because they are worn by time and thrown up on the beach. They are not the monuments of literature, they are the detritus. That exemplifies what I feel about ordinary things. I'm not quite such a Victorian to think that the world is available for classification but it is true that the humdrum and the daily can give clues in a way that the exceptional and the monumental just can't.\" </p> <p><strong> Life at a glance: Marina Sarah Warner </strong></p> <p><strong>Born: </strong> November 9 1946. </p> <p><strong> Relationships: </strong> 1971 married William Shawcross (son Conrad born 1977), divorced; 1981 married John Dewe Mathews, separated; current partner Nick Groom. </p> <p><strong> Education: </strong> St Mary's Convent, Ascot; Lady<strong> </strong> Margaret Hall, Oxford. </p> <p><strong> Career: </strong> Daily Telegraph; features editor Vogue. </p> <p><strong> Non-fiction publications: </strong> The Dragon Empress 1972; Alone of All Her Sex 1976; Queen Victoria's Sketchbook1980; Joan of Arc 1981; Monuments and Maidens1985; Managing Monsters1994; From the Beast to the Blonde1994; No Go the Bogeyman 1998. </p> <p><strong> Fiction: </strong> In a Dark Wood1977; The Skating Party 1983; The Lost Father 1988; Indigo1992; Mermaids in the Basement 1993; Wonder Tales (editor)1994. </p> <p>\u0095 No Go the Bogeyman is published by Vintage at \u00a310.99</p>",

I remember my parents going out a great deal with my father in a dinner jacket and mother in very fancy dresses.\" In what sounds like a neatly prophetic tableau of her glitzy literary life to come, in the evenings she would sit between her father, who was reading the Times Literary Supplement, and her mother, thumbing through Vogue. She enjoyed gossiping in \"kitchen Italian\" with the servants, and expresses some pride that she had a black nanny from the Sudan when so many other expat families \"shipped in white nannies from England\". However, the Egyptian idyll ended in 1952 when the family were forced to leave after her father's warehouse was burned down in the first nationalist riots. Warner recalls her father being \"devastated\" by the fire and his despair being transmitted to the rest of the family. She has not returned to Egypt since, although when she was recently in Israel she says she had a rather \"Proustian moment\", when listening to the sounds of an Arab market: \"I felt an incredible happiness.\" The colourful Cairo social scene also brought the family into contact with some louchely exotic figures. A close friend was the spy Donald Maclean, who worked at the embassy. Warner recalls: \"When he vanished my mother visited his wife in the London clinic where she had just had an operation. My mother was saying how ghastly it all was and Melinda Maclean was lying there saying it was all awful and she couldn't believe it. The next day she had gone too. She had this perfect front.\" Another family friend is Lord Longford, who was at prep school with Marina's father and is her godfather. \"My father was a rather tweedy type who thumped his Daily Telegraph throughout the 60s and 70s [complaining] about the unions and Harold Wilson,\" Warner says. \"So you can imagine his chagrin that first of all his closest friend should become a socialist, but then also a Catholic. But they remained fast friends. \"My father used to chuckle a lot about it. 'Ha ha, what is Frank up to now with another murderess?', stuff like that. [Longford] really does believe in the sinner who repents. I once heard an Egyptian woman saying to him that she thought it was rather good that thieves had their hands cut off under Sharia law. I thought this was going to kill him.\" Although Esmond Warner was an Anglican, he was happy that Marina should be brought up Catholic, as it was, \"a good religion for a girl\". By which he meant, explains Warner, \"that it was demure and chaste and ladylike\". She now say she is \"bored\" with her Catholicism, \"I wish I could invent another family romance.\" But while she left the church long ago, its mind-set still exerts a powerful tug. \"I've read a lot of the Pope's writings. He is very good at bringing an audience to him by picturing how the meek shall inherit the earth, and then suddenly these strictures will come out focused upon women's bodies. \"I have a theory that his obsessive anxiety about the unborn is to do with the church's guilt about the Holocaust. I think the unborn children, these non-existent people, are standing in for the real 20th century ghosts who were the people not helped by the church. It is important that he comes from Poland. It reads to me like a psychological switch from one lot of hauntings to another.\" After the family returned from Cairo they had a short spell in London before moving to Brussels. Marina was sent to the convent of St Mary's in Ascot, and has awful memories of commuting. \"They put a sign saying 'unaccompanied minor' round my neck, and as it always seemed to be foggy at Heathrow I would have to stay for days on end with these distant acquaintances who would have to put me up until the fog lifted.\" Sister Christina Kenworthy Browne taught Warner and recalls her as, \"very clever in a very gifted class. Sarah Hogg was in the same year, but [Warner] was the sort of child whose work you wanted to look at first, you knew it would be interesting. She also had a deep sense of the spiritual. She was interested in symbolism and so on even then. Her troubled Catholicism wasn't evident at school but I think it was boiling underneath.\" In Egypt, Warner had spoken French at school and only spoke English to adults. \"So I was quite badly teased for this stilted way of speaking. I had no school idiom or slang at all and must have sounded horribly pompous.\" And although not initially happy there - when her old headmistress recently died she still had \"mixed feelings\" read ing the obituary in the Times - she grew used to school and began to love some subjects. \"And I was well taught. It did shape me intellectually, and it probably enhanced my feeling for paintings, because as a religion it does love a graven image. But I had lots of struggles with faith. The whole thing was a struggle with a lot of talk about sexual liberation, although that is a phrase that sounds as though it should be in an antique box now.\" Warner went up to Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford at 17, which she now thinks was too young. Diana Quick remembers her as, \"very stylish and confident, and as she knew lots of people before she came up she had a ready-made social circle. While she had a great time socially, she always had a phenomenal capacity for hard work. I remember an edition of Isis she did with an amazing golden cover which was fantastically glamorous for a university rag.\" Tariq Ali was head of the Oxford Union, and the Monty Python crowd were a few years ahead of her, but she says for the most part she found Oxford stifling. \"They weren't used to undergraduates who were modern women, and the sense of decorum was oppressive. It was assumed that any woman who was interested in clothes must be a silly goose. Now one is used to meeting a woman with a first in philosophy wearing the latest nose ring, or whatever. In those days if you went to a tutorial in a mini skirt it meant you weren't serious about study.\" After university she was offered a job on the Daily Telegraph, where she won an award for young journalist of the year before moving on, aged 23, to be the features editor on Vogue. She interviewed the 60s guru, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, and the artist MC Escher. As the house photographers were Snowdon, Bailey and Beaton, getting high-profile subjects was no problem. \"And all I really had to do was write an extended photo caption,\" Warner says. \"It was wonderful.\" At this time she wrote her first novel, but it was rejected by Cecil Day Lewis, then at Chatto &amp; Windus. \"He called me in and said it was good but not good enough to publish. He suggested I try non-fiction.\" Her first book was a biography of the last Chinese Empress, Tz'u-Hsi, chosen because she had always been interested in Chinese culture. In a very Warner-esque way she was originally turned on to it by all that odd Chinoiserie in the Rupert Bear cartoon strip. She eventually left Vogue in 1971 to go to America with her boyfriend, the journalist William Shawcross, whom she had met at Oxford. \"I had to get married to go with him,\" she explains. \"We wouldn't have got married unless we had to, for practical reasons, but also I didn't want to give up my job without some sort of security, so I suppose in that sense I was a bourgeois.\" Shawcross was writing speeches for Senator Edward Kennedy, but soon the Watergate story erupted, ultimately to bring down President Nixon. A Sunday Times team arrived to stay at their flat, and the journalistic orgy commenced. \"William was incredibly excited but I was pretty much left to my own devices,\" she remembers. \"So I spent hours in the Library of Congress reading around eight books a day on the Virgin Mary for my book about the Mary cult, Alone of All Her Sex. I wasn't exactly miserable. I just didn't have anything else to do.\" Warner then went with Shawcross to Vietnam, where she witnessed the aftermath of the napalm raid on Trang Bang and actually saw the horribly burned girl captured in the now-famous photograph. While there her research into the model of womanhood thrown up by Mariolatry increasingly became a painful personal voyage of discovery. \"The religion I had absorbed and discarded was very different to what I found in the history, in that the cult of Mary had changed so much over the years and served so many purposes.\" In 1977 their son, Conrad, was born. (He is currently taking an MA in sculpture at the Slade school of art.) But the marriage broke down a couple of years later, and in 1981, Warner married the painter John Dewe Mathews in a Catholic ceremony abetted by Cardinal Hume, who had been Mathews' housemaster at Ampleforth. This second marriage ended three years ago. \"It was obviously painful but it was the right thing to do,\" she says. \"We'd been married a long time and we had changed. We didn't have any children, which was a great sadness. We both expected to have children, and it was an incredible surprise to me, who spent most of my youth desperately avoiding getting pregnant. I think he is probably better off now, but he is a very gentle man and he wouldn't have done it himself.\" Warner's new partner is Nick Groom, an English lecturer at the University of Exeter, at 33 some 20 years her junior. \"I was very surprised when we got together,\" she says. \"I thought he was a young friend. But now we squabble like an old married couple.\" There have been other changes to her life in recent years. In political terms her impeccable north London liberal activism - she was on the committee of management of the National Council for One-Parent Families, and a leading member of Charter 88 - has been shaken. She was a member of CND and \"hung on until Greenham Common was decommissioned. I received these awfully Xeroxed sheets from the rump of the Kentish Town branch right until the end.\" But now she confesses to being baffled as to whether CND was actually beneficial. \"It was clearly very damaging to the Labour Party, and contributed to its failure. They might have made more headway earlier if they hadn't had such a CND policy. And we might not have had some of the things that have happened under the Conservatives. In some awful way [the Bomb] did seem to have kept the peace. But I had a Bertrand Russell view that it was a wicked thing in itself, and one should not espouse wickedness.\" She is attempting to incorporate these themes of confusion - \"not political analysis but the human landscape\" - in a new novel she is working on. \"I find that if I read in the New York Review of Books a piece about how we should go into Kosovo with a land army I'm completely convinced. And then I read somewhere else that it's a disgraceful act of colonisation and imperialism for our trade benefits, and I'm equally convinced.\" Carmen Callil places her among the leading trinity of British female writers. \"At one time I was publish ing Marina, Antonia Byatt and Angela Carter. They each delivered a new book at about the same time and they were all about fairy stories. When Angie died I told Marina that now her workload would be quintupled. She'd have to do everything that Angie did, as well as all her own stuff. But she has been marvellous. One day she will write a really great novel.\" Warner suspects she has entirely different readerships for her fiction and non-fiction but has recently begun to see her work as a series of diptychs. Her first novel, In a Dark Wood, written in 1977, came out after the Virgin Mary book, and featured a vision of Mary when a man has a crisis of faith after falling in love with a boy. \"I was dramatising my own departure from Catholicism,\" she now sees. \"The main thing I disputed was its attitude to sexuality.\" She then wrote about the various appropriations of the Joan of Arc myth, while in her next novel, The Skating Party, an anthropologist comes across a young girl who has been declared a witch. \"She was a modern Joan of Arc and the anthropologist was a 20th century inquisitor. It was a different way of standing back and seeing evil done.\" In 1988 her third novel, The Lost Father, was placed on an extremely strong Booker shortlist. The winner was Peter Carey's Oscar and Lucinda but Warner shared the stage with Bruce Chatwin, David Lodge, Penelope Fitzgerald and Salman Rushdie, whose entry was Satanic Verses. To carry on the diptych idea, The Lost Father can be seen as a companion to her book about state language, Monuments and Maidens, in which she explores how women are used to personify the state and ideas of the state, liberty being one example. In The Lost Father, a family saga set in Italy, women acting as the guardians of the fatherland collude in the \"romancing of eternal patriarchal figures\". It was written after the death of her father, when she realised that she had never really spoken to him. \"I hadn't talked to him enough about his life and what he felt about things. I was too young, antagonistic and hostile. We'd always end up having a fight about Arthur Scargill instead of me asking him any interesting questions. \"I still regret that, so I made sure I did ask my mother about her life. She had been transplanted from Italy, and I told her I'd seen newsreel footage of when Mussolini asked women to give up their wedding rings as part of the war effort in Abyssinia and they got a ring of iron in return. It turns out my mother went with my grandmother to do this.\" Roy Foster calls her fiction \"mightily impressive. I'm very fond of The Lost Father and admire her next novel, Indigo, hugely. It was a very brave book to write and very successful in its own terms. She was entering a territory which is highly contested, where all sorts of people have territorial claims; that is the territory of race. But she occupied it with integrity and grace and imagination.\" Indigo, set on a magical Caribbean island, draws on The Tempest to dissect colonialism, exploitation and slavery. Warner was particularly delighted when the poet and Nobel laureate Derek Walcott praised the novel. She has proudly kept the notes he used when introducing her at a reading in St Lucia. \"They are in this beautiful handwriting with bits of paper stuck all over it as he worked on it. It is a wonderful document.\" She acknowledges that her fiction, written in a poeticised language, is not very fashionable - \"It comes from my background with French and Italian and is not influenced by American minimalism\" - and worries at the lottery that sales of literary fiction can be. \"You might put 10 years work into a book and it will sell 500 copies.\" So she continues in her self-defined role. Public intellectual? Independent scholar? \"I prefer just to be called a writer,\" she says. \"At one time I did want to be attached to an institution. But I've changed my view dramatically, as I think I have now broken through and people don't despise me any more. They used to use the term 'Vogue journalist' as an insult and I wanted to be enfolded and enclosed. I wanted people to say I could be one of them. But now I'm loaded with honorary doctorates and that recognition is comforting.\" She is presented with another one today from the Tavistock Clinic, the renowned school of mental health training, research and scholarship. Warner says that the single event that most contributed to this acceptance was when she delivered the 1994 BBC Reith Lectures, only the second woman in 47 years to do so. Her series of talks, Managing Monsters: Six Myths Of Our Time, was a culmination of her work at the time, and the subsequent book has become a set text on cultural studies courses. Liz Forgan was managing director of BBC radio at the time. \"Marina's extremely original way of seeing straight to the heart of contemporary culture through the prism of myth and ancient stories was perfect for us,\" she says. \"And the reaction showed me that we were completely correct in finding a truly original voice. Half the world thought it was wonderful and opened doors that they had always known were there but hadn't thought to open. The other half hated it and thought it was just the wrong womany sound. I was delighted about that.\" Warner recalls it as \"real head-above-the-parapet stuff, which I don't usually have much stomach for. But I do realise that sometimes you need Janet Daley to say it is all meretricious claptrap. You can't expect to be bland and for everyone to just worship and admire your argument. I have kept my head down to a large extent as I think that, rather than get into spats, you should put all that energy into work. \"My only reservation is that it is a bit of cowardice sometimes. If you look at literary history, it is these rows that changed minds and directions. We have a bit of a tame circle of spite, in which some people write bad reviews about other people. That is not the same as a precipitating a real debate about what fiction, or memoirs, or history should be doing.\" In what appears to be something of a departure, she is currently studying various aspects of psychic research: \"There are some very distinguished physicists who say that not all the problems have been solved: the known has expanded, but there is still a lot unknown. Some of them are fairly interested in psychic stuff. \"In fact while the bogeyman material is a certain literary strand of a representation of the unknown, there is a parallel strand that comes out of the scientific enquiry culture. They're not exactly woven together, but they do keep step together, in a way. It all provides clues\". An enhanced appreciation of the cultural currents that have shaped the world may equip us better to change that world. \"Updike called fairy tales beach glass, because they are worn by time and thrown up on the beach. They are not the monuments of literature, they are the detritus. That exemplifies what I feel about ordinary things. I'm not quite such a Victorian to think that the world is available for classification but it is true that the humdrum and the daily can give clues in a way that the exceptional and the monumental just can't.\" Life at a glance: Marina Sarah Warner Born: November 9 1946.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>When the old man died in November 1997, he was mourned on both sides of the Atlantic not just as a liberal sage but as the very epitome of a free-spirited mind. His work had been a long, tacit commentary on his extraordinary life, and the central event in both had been the Russian revolution. He had witnessed it himself as a child of eight in the streets of Petersburg, and almost everything he wrote thereafter was a sustained protest against the violence, tyranny, cruelty and oppression given licence by the communist vision of a brighter tomorrow. His greatest essay - Two Concepts of Liberty -was much more than a defence of moderation and pragmatism in politics. It insisted that our most deeply held political values-justice and liberty-contradicted each other. Because they did, no utopia could ever reconcile them in harmony, and because they could not be reconciled, all political judgment entailed tragic choice, not just between good and evil but between competing goods. </p> <p>As Isaiah Berlin's biographer, I made the innocent-and foolish-assumption that his reputation would not need defending. He never made the same mistake himself. He shrewdly guessed that his stock was riding too high in life. A correction was overdue. </p> <p>When it came, the only thing that might have surprised him was its indecent haste. He was not even in his grave when Paul Johnson wrote in the New York Times that Berlin had only been a \"low-risk philosopher\" afraid to challenge the liberal commonplaces of the British elite. A week later, Cambridge don Michael Tanner pronounced that, instead of working against the current of conventional opinion, Berlin had always been that current. </p> <p>These critics - and there were many more - claimed that their objective was not the man or his thought, so much as the cult of veneration surrounding him. This was fair enough. Obituary writers had called him a \"liberal saint\", and saints should be fair game. When my biography was published in November 1998, it soon became clear that the real object of the attack was liberalism itself. Why else would Christopher Hitchens have devoted so much vehemence in the London Review of Books to demonstrating that Berlin had been less courageous or consistent than I had made him out to be? Berlin was in Hitchens' line of fire since he seemed to embody all of liberalism's supposed evasions. As Hitchens put it, \"There is a sense in which, if you chafe at the present complacently 'liberal' consensus, the reputation of Isaiah Berlin stands like a lion in your path.\" </p> <p>There was just one problem. Where was this \"complacently liberal consensus\"? The L-word had been a term of abuse in American politics since Nixon's election in l968. Hitchens, who has an unequalled talent for mocking the earnest emptiness of the Clinton era, ought to know that whatever the American consensus now is, it is not liberal. As for Britain, the liberal current is squeezed hard between the two tribes, one worshipping Mrs Thatcher, the other praying to Nye Bevan. Berlin had no visiting rights in either camp.

Both left and right never fail to pair liberalism with spinelessness. Since my biography chronicles the moments where Berlin showed that liberals have spines, it is pointless to rehearse these again. With respect to Hitchens and Podhoretz, I would be preaching to the deaf. Their need for the caricature of the liberal as mollusc leaves them impervious to demonstration. What they actually mean is not that Berlin failed to choose, but that he did not choose as they would have wished him to. </p> <p>Then there were the attacks on his intellectual seriousness. All three - Paul Johnson, Christopher Hitchens and Norman Podhoretz - are intellectual entertainers. How odd, then, that they should try so hard to prove that Berlin was nothing better than an entertainer like themselves. Lacking, of course, their fighting virtues. One pauses to recollect what lonely causes these men have defended at the cost of their reputations, what Orwell-like displays of courage entitle them to be so scathing about Berlin's timidities. But of course! They have spent themselves in selfless combat against that overwhelming, suffocating liberal consensus. </p> <p>Hitchens would say - indeed did say to me - that associating him with Podhoretz's critique of Berlin is a Zhdanovite proceeding.

Hitchens would be sensitive to such proceedings, since this is his own preferred modus operandi. </p> <p>But in hands less adept than Zhdanov's they result in unintentional comedy, as when Hitchens picked upon Berlin's remark that his liberalism owed much to Lloyd George. Aha! said Hitchens, this must mean Lloyd George, \"the patron of Field Marshal Douglas Haig\", which then makes Berlin guilty by association, not with Lloyd George's state pensions, but with the massacre at the Somme! Pouncing again on Berlin's approval of Franklin Roosevelt, Hitchens dimly surmises that this must also mean supporting \"the originator of the war economy\" and the \"prime mover of American acquisition of European empires\". So if liberals believe in the New Deal, they must also be firm supporters of American imperialism and the national security state. This is not an argument, but a non-sequitur. Many liberals opposed the Vietnam war precisely because they believed an empire abroad was ultimately incompatible with democracy at home. </p> <p>The technique of guilt by association invariably requires crude misrepresentation in its indictment. Hitchens could only convict Berlin of bloodthirsty support for the Vietnam war on the basis of misquotation from letters about McGeorge Bundy, one of the chief architects of American policy. The letters praise Bundy not for his policies in Vietnam, but for his decision, as president of the Ford Foundation, to fund Wolfson College, the institution Berlin was seeking to establish for graduate education in Oxford. </p> <p>Of course, Berlin made mistakes. Why deny it? Having myself marched against the war, I would have liked to have seen the great old man arm in arm, with - why not? - Hitchens himself at the head of the demonstrations in which I brought up the rear. But Berlin wasn't there, because he couldn't reconcile his doubts about American policy with his equally strong anti-communism. The same anti-communism led him to impede the academic career in Britain of Isaac Deutscher, the biographer of Trotsky. This loathing for communism and its fellow travellers led him occasionally to betray one set of liberal values for the sake of another. Hitchens never has such conflicts, of course, and so he has no respect for those who struggle to do the right thing. </p> <p> Anyone younger than 50, anyone who did not cut their teeth on politics in the Vietnam era, might be forgiven for wondering whether any of this matters. Such persons will not much care that I, his biographer, should feel aggrieved that a man I loved should be so traduced, and that a figure of real stature should still be under attack from such pygmies and their poison darts. What may be interesting to people who never knew Berlin is the way these attacks upon him reveal the emptiness of the quarrels inherited from his heyday.

It was then that the left found its surviving raison d' tre in a loathing for liberal moderation. </p> <p>What the fate of Berlin's reputation makes so clear is that the ideologies of left and right absolutely required the liberal enemy to give allure to their own poses.

Berlin was not immune to this illusion. Being disliked equally by two extremes makes you feel self-righteous, but it doesn't prove you right. Viewing all this through the eyes of a 25-year-old, the whole Kulturkampf of the 60s sounds worn out. The Soviet empire is no more; the left has collapsed; the right is discredited.

      "bodyText": "When the old man died in November 1997, he was mourned on both sides of the Atlantic not just as a liberal sage but as the very epitome of a free-spirited mind. His work had been a long, tacit commentary on his extraordinary life, and the central event in both had been the Russian revolution. He had witnessed it himself as a child of eight in the streets of Petersburg, and almost everything he wrote thereafter was a sustained protest against the violence, tyranny, cruelty and oppression given licence by the communist vision of a brighter tomorrow. His greatest essay - Two Concepts of Liberty -was much more than a defence of moderation and pragmatism in politics. It insisted that our most deeply held political values-justice and liberty-contradicted each other. Because they did, no utopia could ever reconcile them in harmony, and because they could not be reconciled, all political judgment entailed tragic choice, not just between good and evil but between competing goods. As Isaiah Berlin's biographer, I made the innocent-and foolish-assumption that his reputation would not need defending. He never made the same mistake himself. He shrewdly guessed that his stock was riding too high in life. A correction was overdue. When it came, the only thing that might have surprised him was its indecent haste. He was not even in his grave when Paul Johnson wrote in the New York Times that Berlin had only been a \"low-risk philosopher\" afraid to challenge the liberal commonplaces of the British elite. A week later, Cambridge don Michael Tanner pronounced that, instead of working against the current of conventional opinion, Berlin had always been that current. These critics - and there were many more - claimed that their objective was not the man or his thought, so much as the cult of veneration surrounding him. This was fair enough. Obituary writers had called him a \"liberal saint\", and saints should be fair game. When my biography was published in November 1998, it soon became clear that the real object of the attack was liberalism itself. Why else would Christopher Hitchens have devoted so much vehemence in the London Review of Books to demonstrating that Berlin had been less courageous or consistent than I had made him out to be? Berlin was in Hitchens' line of fire since he seemed to embody all of liberalism's supposed evasions. As Hitchens put it, \"There is a sense in which, if you chafe at the present complacently 'liberal' consensus, the reputation of Isaiah Berlin stands like a lion in your path.\" There was just one problem. Where was this \"complacently liberal consensus\"? The L-word had been a term of abuse in American politics since Nixon's election in l968. Hitchens, who has an unequalled talent for mocking the earnest emptiness of the Clinton era, ought to know that whatever the American consensus now is, it is not liberal. As for Britain, the liberal current is squeezed hard between the two tribes, one worshipping Mrs Thatcher, the other praying to Nye Bevan. Berlin had no visiting rights in either camp. Mrs Thatcher thought him much too wet to be \"one of us\"; Tony Blair's government thought him too individualistic to serve as patron saint of the Third Way. The idea of Berlin as the high priest of a transatlantic consensus of liberal complacency was a fiction, but a necessary one. For what else but this fiction holds Hitchens' own politics together? Those useful idiots, the liberals, help keep the left in business on both sides of the Atlantic. Besides, Hitchens' attack on Berlin for being the ingratiating friend of the fashionable was a useful pose for anyone wanting to refute the charge that this was precisely what he was himself.

The backs of your legs as you went ahead of me up the stairs. The landing where we paused for breath and impatient key searching. The locks which would never open quickly enough to let us in. The green of the paintwork we slid down as if we had nowhere else to go. Rhetorical Questions How do you think I feel when you make me talk to you and won't let me stop till the words turn into a moan? Do you think I mind when you put your hand over my mouth and tell me not to move so you can \"hear\" it happening? And how do you think I like it when you tell me what to do and your mouth opens and you look straight through me? Do you think I mind when the blank expression comes and you set off alone down the hall of collapsing columns? Her News You paused for a moment and I heard you smoking on the other end of the line. I pictured your expression, one eye screwed shut against the smoke as you waited for my reaction. I was waiting for it myself, a list of my own news gone suddenly cold in my hand. Supposing my wife found out, what would happen then? Would I have to leave her and marry you now? Perhaps it wouldn't be so bad, starting again with someone new, finding a new place, pretending the best was yet to come. It might even be fun, playing the family man, walking around in the park full of righteous indignation. But no, I couldn't go through all that again, not without my own wife being there, not without her getting cross about everything. Perhaps she wouldn't mind about the baby, then we could buy a house in the country and all move in together. That sounded like a better idea. Now that I'd been caught at last, a wave of relief swept over me.

      "body": "<p><strong> Dear Chris,</strong> <br> I'm a huge fan of the internet. It is a tremendous human achievement which promises to enrich our lives in all sorts of ways. However, as with many emerging technologies, the internet has brought a few problems in its wake. Bad guys, mad guys and criminals are exploiting its fluidity and potential for anonymity in ways that none of the net's inventors foresaw or intended, and which no civilised society can ignore for long. </p> <p>In the USA, so far, over 200 men have been sentenced to prison terms for the attempted or actual \"sexual solicitation\" of minors where the internet played a part in the crime. In the UK, we had the Gary Glitter case, and there are more in the pipeline, even if those involved are not quite so famous. </p> <p>So it all seems fairly obvious to me. Stand by and do nothing and we risk the emergence of a thousand virtual Mary Whitehouses, who have little stake in the internet, demanding that politicians \"do something\" to \"protect our children\" or \"get rid of the filth\". In Australia, such pressures have already been at work, and it is not hard to imagine how they might take off here. </p> <p>Attempting to censor the internet's content is not the answer - even if it were possible. However, the industry can and should do more to empower internet users to protect themselves and their loved ones. Inevitably this means we need more and better filtering tools, but that's just another way of saying we need to give people more power and choices about how they use the internet. Now who could possibly be against that? <br> Yours, John Carr, <br> Internet consultant, NCH - Action for Children </p> <p> <strong> Dear John,</strong> <br> I agree that internet users need improved technologies. Not just better tools to allow us to exclude material, but better search engines, more usable sites, and faster access. </p> <p>We should have more power to make choices about the internet. However, \"industry self-regulation\" has already led to regulatory quangos and internet service providers closing sites and censoring newsgroups. We cannot have the power to make choices about material on the internet if someone else has already decided that we cannot see it. </p> <p>I know you will probably want to talk about children and pornography in an attempt to justify blocking content - it's the oldest trick in the censor's book - but I'm not just talking about this. Perfectly legal forums have been closed by ISPs including a news site about Basque separatism, a Northern Ireland discussion group and a site criticising Britain's judicial system. All in the name of \"self-regulation\". The truth is, users are not permitted to regulate what they see; someone else does it for them. Plain old censorship in sheep's clothing. <br> Yours sincerely, Dr Chris Evans, <br> Founder, <a href=\"http://www.netfreedom.org\">Internet Freedom</a> </p> <p><strong> Dear Chris,</strong> <br> \"Self-regulation\" as it exists in the UK internet industry is no more than an organised attempt to ensure that our existing laws are upheld in cyberspace. You may not like those laws, but that's a separate issue. Any ISP that goes beyond what the law requires is doing so in its own name. </p> <p>The logic of your argument is that ISPs are compelled to carry anything their customers serve up to them: a sort of enforced libertarianism. To do that you would have to give ISPs legal immunity should something go wrong later. Anything short of this takes you back to a position where somebody has to make judgments about what is or is not acceptable - and then you have a self-regulatory system again. </p> <p>Every branch of our media has some sort of regulatory framework. Why should the internet be any different? And by the way, I thought your comments about children and pornography were rather trite. There are problems. They are not being conjured up from nothing as a ruse to justify greater oppressive controls. To paraphrase Orwell, just because it appears in the Daily Mail doesn't mean it isn't true. </p> <p>There was a time, not so long ago, when the internet was the exclusive possession of a rarefied group within our universities and research communities. But the internet has moved from the ivory tower to the high street. It takes a rare kind of myopia to believe that the rules that applied in that prelapsarian idyll can survive intact following prolonged contact with the ruder, larger world. <br> Yours, John </p> <p> <strong> Dear John,</strong> <br> As I have explained, self-regulation has led to ISPs going well beyond the law in removing perfectly legal material. I don't think they are motivated by commercial assessment. There is little evidence that ISPs are losing revenue by failing to censor customers. On the contrary, they lose revenue by closing their accounts. I think they are motivated out of fear of being branded morally irresponsible in a climate where political correctness is the watchword of business. </p> <p>ISPs are not accountable for what internet users transmit, any more than the post office is responsible for what I write in my letters, or BT is responsible for what I say on the phone. I do not expect them to monitor the contents of my writings and conversations in the name of self-regulation. This is not enforced libertarianism, it is common sense. </p> <p>What we are permitted to read or see should not be decided by ISPs. The only people that should make judgments about material are readers themselves. We are no less able to make up our own minds than the academics in ivory towers to which you refer. This is the irony of \"self-regulation\": it's really about someone else deciding what we should see and nothing to do with making judgments for ourselves. <br> Yours sincerely, Chris </p> <p> <strong> Dear Chris,</strong> <br> I think we have come full circle. Either you believe the internet should have no barriers or restraints in terms of what might be published on it, or you accept that there should be some rules. If you accept that there ought to be some rules, you have one more decision to make: do you simply leave it at that, or do you try to establish some means of giving effect to the rules? In real life, sadly, the former isn't tenable. It merely gives a licence to abusers. </p> <p>Thus while we might argue about what the rules ought to be, once you concede the point, all that remains is a decision about how you give effect to them. That inevitably means giving someone the power or the duty to make prior decisions. In the UK we have decided to let the industry do it itself. Doubtless if that is found to be unsatisfactory, it can be revisited. So far, in relation to illegal publications on the web, the system seems to be working. But there is a great deal else that needs to be done before the internet can truly be said to be acceptable in the mass market it seems to want to occupy. </p> <p>In the end I believe that everyone should have a personal internet that suits them. If you want to revel in the anarchic, romantic notions of what you think the internet once was, then that's OK with me. But please don't make me or my children share it with you. Let us make our own decisions about what comes into our home, in the same way our family does about what videos we rent, and where we go for our holidays. <br> Yours, John </p> <p> <strong> Dear John,</strong> <br> I'm not surprised to hear you say you don't trust individuals to decide for themselves. We should indeed be able to make our own decisions about what comes into our home. The Internet Watch Foundation, on whose board you sit, is a good example of an organisation that prefers to make these decisions for us. </p> <p>Whilst the IWF is funded by the internet industry, they have the backing of the department of trade and industry, the home office and the police. Their de facto powers far exceed those of the police. They advise ISPs to remove material and ISPs consistently comply. Research conducted for the Institute of Economic Affairs reveals that in the UK 94% of this material is considered by neither judge nor jury. As a consequence, over 9,000 items have been removed from the net despite only 24 successful prosecutions. In their latest announcement the IWF will regulate \"criminal racist content\". There is no such category under UK law. Presumably the IWF is going to invent new reasons for removing content from the net. </p> <p>As a non-governmental organisation, the IWF is not accountable to the general public. Net users do not elect board members. Judgments are not made by juries. There's no form of redress for those whose freedom of expression is curtailed. It all makes Mary Whitehouse look pretty tame, don't you think? <br> Yours sincerely, Chris</p>",

      "bodyText": "Both sides in the battle over the right to trial by jury dug their heels in yesterday as Tony Blair and Jack Straw said they would reintroduce the bill defeated this week by the half-reformed House of Lords. The morning after a cross-party coalition of self-confessed \"Hampstead liberals\" - and even some Hampstead Tories - voted against Mr Straw's plans, the home secretary again told them they were wrong, as he himself had been when he opposed the change before 1997. He was promptly warned that his criminal justice (mode of trial) No 2 bill would suffer the same fate as the No 1. He declared: \"This is one of those issues where many people at first blush take the view I did. But the more you go into it, the more you can see overwhelmingly the case in its favour.\" Speaking in east London, the prime minister echoed Mr Straw's insistence that \"this is about modernising the criminal justice system. It's about ensuring it is rebalanced in favour of victims and witnesses as well as defendants, while protecting the rights of defendants.\" Critics, who include Labour's former liberal home secretary Lord (Roy) Jenkins as well as some high-profile New Labour peers, have called the measure \"profoundly undemocratic\" and short-sighted, all to save an estimated \u00a3100m a year on costly crown court trials. Yesterday Simon Hughes, Liberal Democrat spokesman and a barrister like Mr Straw, said the government's case - that some defendants in relatively minor theft cases were abusing the ancient right to elect trial by jury and should be dealt with by magistrates - was only \"superficially persuasive\". Ministers lost in the Lords, on the very day the Wakeham plan for long term Lords reform was published, by a thumping 222-126 votes, after the Tories changed sides on the issue. Yesterday Ann Widdecombe, the shadow home secretary, tweaked their tail: \"Drop this bill completely. After all, it is this government which has said that the current House of Lords has a greater democratic legitimacy than the previous House of Lords.

On Wednesday Cllr Dixon described Tyson as a \"pariah\" and said he \"was definitely not welcome in Brixton\". Yesterday he was proved emphatically wrong as the people of the south London borough turned out to afford Tyson a rapturous welcome. The boxer brought Brixton to a standstill as he embarked on a chaotic walkabout on the same streets visited in recent years by Muhammad Ali and Nelson Mandela. The 1,000-strong crowd was smaller than that which greeted Ali and Mandela, but the welcome no less enthusiastic. After a 40-minute walk, mobbed by crowds who were singing, dancing and chanting his name, Tyson had to abandon his tour and take shelter in Brixton police station. Twenty minutes later, in one of the most incongruous scenes witnessed at the station, a focus for so much of the discontent felt by the local community over the years, Tyson appeared at a top floor window with a megaphone and addressed the crowd. \"They say they don't want me here, right?

The Tyson cavalcade arrived in Brixton shortly after 2pm and stopped in Gresham Road, site of Brixton mosque, which was visited by Ali last year. Tyson's arrival seemed to catch police under-prepared, and as word spread that he had arrived, reinforcements were quickly called in to protect him from the crowds that flooded into the road, climbed trees and clambered on to the top of buses to catch a glimpse of him. Before leaving his hotel in Park Lane, central London, Tyson explained why he wanted to visit Brixton. \"There's a lot of people, for my history of Brixton, that murdered people, that went to prison and did some things. \"I've lived there.

There were five people studying it in his year at York, the only university that offered a degree in the subject. Yet these are the experts whose specialised knowledge determines what is probably the biggest issue in domestic politics today. There are far more health economists working for the big drug companies than for the NHS. </p> <p>\"British health economists are self-selecting,\" he says. \"They are people who didn't like the macro side of economics or the market side. American health economists are much more market-oriented. But in this country when Margaret Thatcher brought in the so-called internal market, suddenly the hospitals were turning to the health economists and asking how to price their services - and all the economists they turned to knew nothing about markets. It is a bit of a relief that government policy has moved away from that area.\" </p> <p>As he talks about his work, two ideas are constantly struggling within it. The first is that the big strategic choice to have a taxpayer-funded NHS was the right one, and should be maintained. \"In the very long run you can either have a system like the NHS where you pay in advance and everyone can afford it; or you can have another system. There are some big choices here. In this country we have already taken the choice not to go with the market mechanism, and to take the collective insurance route.\" </p> <p>But this means, he says, that the crises in the NHS are going to be chronic. \"One of the things universal systems are bad at doing is arriving at some equilibrium between what individuals accept and what the system can collectively provide. It's a trade-off. Being fairer and more equitable may bring with it things like waiting lists.\" </p> <p>So you are an economist who is meant to be on the side of inefficiency? \"Yes, if you caricature economists as people who want to see the most efficient allocation of resources.\" But that is not really a caricature. It is a large part of the other idea that he keeps returning to: that an economist's job is like a civil servant's - not to make decisions, but to identify the decisions that have to be made. </p> <p>\"Markets privatise rationing decisions. But we are now trying to turn that inside out and expose them in a rather public way.\" He gives as an example research he did recently to find out what the public really thought about how choices should be made about treating people. \"Basically they think the money should go to human beings who are going to have the potential to live longest. Health economists have made themselves quite unpopular by taking this rather utilitarian line - that we should put the money where it can buy most health: we have been told that we discriminate against the elderly and so on. But when you do go on to ask the public, at least hypothetically, they agree.\" </p> <p>This sort of knowledge must be a nightmare to politicians, and not only because the health of someone else's mother against that of her child is not going to get the same answer as a real question about the health of a voter's mother versus a stranger's child. </p> <p>\"I once met Robin Cook, when he has the opposition spokeman on health. We were talking about this sort of thing and suddenly he snapped at me 'That's politics. I'm the politician. Leave that for me.' But a lot of economics encroaches on other fields. We are falling into philosophy all the time: how do I understand what my opinion is? How do I know what I think about some matters?\" He sounds more comfortable as an an unacknowledged legislator than an executive.</p>",

In this country we have already taken the choice not to go with the market mechanism, and to take the collective insurance route.\" But this means, he says, that the crises in the NHS are going to be chronic. \"One of the things universal systems are bad at doing is arriving at some equilibrium between what individuals accept and what the system can collectively provide. It's a trade-off. Being fairer and more equitable may bring with it things like waiting lists.\" So you are an economist who is meant to be on the side of inefficiency? \"Yes, if you caricature economists as people who want to see the most efficient allocation of resources.\" But that is not really a caricature. It is a large part of the other idea that he keeps returning to: that an economist's job is like a civil servant's - not to make decisions, but to identify the decisions that have to be made. \"Markets privatise rationing decisions. But we are now trying to turn that inside out and expose them in a rather public way.\" He gives as an example research he did recently to find out what the public really thought about how choices should be made about treating people. \"Basically they think the money should go to human beings who are going to have the potential to live longest. Health economists have made themselves quite unpopular by taking this rather utilitarian line - that we should put the money where it can buy most health: we have been told that we discriminate against the elderly and so on. But when you do go on to ask the public, at least hypothetically, they agree.\" This sort of knowledge must be a nightmare to politicians, and not only because the health of someone else's mother against that of her child is not going to get the same answer as a real question about the health of a voter's mother versus a stranger's child. \"I once met Robin Cook, when he has the opposition spokeman on health. We were talking about this sort of thing and suddenly he snapped at me 'That's politics. I'm the politician. Leave that for me.' But a lot of economics encroaches on other fields. We are falling into philosophy all the time: how do I understand what my opinion is? How do I know what I think about some matters?\" He sounds more comfortable as an an unacknowledged legislator than an executive.",

The curious thing about the replies was that some of those who had views on the subject unexpectedly commended TV's neglect of libraries. \"Should there be programmes with libraries?\" Charles Fisher inquired of himself. \"No, not really,\" he replied. \"I do like the fact that you don't get any librarians on TV,\" Carol Cooper confessed. \"Not even detectives.\" </p> <p>I find this attitude deplorably selfish. Look at it this way: if television gave us more programmes about librarians and actors dressed up as librarians, there would have to be fewer programmes about the police and people dressed up as the police, which at present is most programmes. </p> <p>I suspect the point about detectives is, anyway, wrong. I don't go in for this kind of fiction myself, but I always understood that most fictional murders took place at house parties, and that house party murders usually take place in the library. For educational reasons, I favour a series in which every episode opens in just such a library where Inspector Stealth is staring hard at a corpse. \" I must say,\" his sidekick, Constable Sidekick, observes, surveying the groaning shelves, \"these people seem deuced keen on reading.\" \"And rightly so,\" the inspector tells him, in terms of Morse-like rebuke, pulling a book from the shelf. \"By Jove! Here's a first edition of Aphra Behn.\" </p> <p>Apart from a moment when the corpse is carted away to the mortuary, the whole of the rest of this episode would then be taken up with discussing the works of Aphra Behn and how to get hold of them from your library. Stealth, by the way, will be played by John Thaw and Sidekick by Ginger Evans. </p> <p> Some television producers, hopelessly set in their ways, might recoil from this concept, claiming it lacks excitement. And indeed, it is sometimes said by librarians that their duty (to sit at desks telling people where to find Debrett, the Decameron, or the latest JK Rowling) is sadly lacking in thrills. </p> <p>But Smallweed has plans for that, too. A second library series would concentrate on the works of paralibrarians, the profession's equivalent of paramedics. It would show them, for instance, parachuting in to the gardens of elderly housebound people with the latest Catherine Cookson or Irvine Welsh. I dare say, to boost the ratings, a librarian devoid of a bra would hang around just long enough to organise a makeover of their bookshelves. In Smallweed's view, this sort of cross fertilisation is far too rarely practised in television and we cannot have too much of it. </p> <p> According to a BBC reporter, the Northern Ireland secretary Peter Mandelson has been lavishing \"fulsome praise\" on the RUC, as he explained to the Commons his plans to change it into something else. I fear it is now too late to save the word fulsome from meaning simply \"full\". You would not catch the Guardian making such a mistake, since those who misuse the word have been soundly rebuked by the Readers' Editor. The rest of the world, unhappily, does not respond to his threats. It was pretty clear from the context that the BBC reporter did not intend to imply that Mandelson was \"cloying, causing surfeit, nauseous, offensive, gross, rank, disgustingly fawning\". He is not David Frost. But that, even so, was the verdict he gave to the nation. </p> <p> I have drawn attention several times to the practice of Conrad Black, proprietor of the Daily Thongograph and Spectator, in festooning his publications with people called Johnson. My catalogue has been incomplete. In this week's Spectator, the crossword editor confesses that he is a Johnson too. </p> <p> Yet another big cup tie (Leicester v Arsenal) is settled by an inane penalty shootout, and this despite Smallweed's compelling proposal for replacing them with a formula which would benefit the game by discouraging clubs from filling their sides with foreign players. The England coach, Kevin Keegan, this week declared his dismay at the implications of this importational tendency for the future of English football. What I proposed was this: where teams are level at the end of extra time, the tie should be awarded to the side whose players were born least far from the ground. At the time this was mindlessly disparaged on the grounds that one could not expect a referee at the end of 120 minutes to demand the players' birth certificates and start computing the relevant distances. </p> <p>But that objection is now, as Roy Jenkins would say, otiose, disposed of by a brilliant initiative on the part of Guardian Sport. Every Monday, an analysis appears of players' birthplaces. Last Monday, for instance, the featured side was Barnsley. Its players were born an average of 436 miles from its Oakwell headquarters. In Arsenal's case that figure would have been nearer 1,500 and Wednesday's match would have been awarded to Leicester City. I hope to have Kevin Keegan's endorsement by the end of next week. </p> <p> I was wrong about Churchill using \"terminological inexactitude\" as a euphemism for \"lie\". An erudite letter from Cambridge quotes a speech he made in the Commons in 1906 on Chinese labour in South Africa. The contracts involved might not be proper or healthy, he said, but they could not, in the government's view, be classified as slavery in the extreme acceptance of the word \"without some risk of terminological inexactitude\". The error is corrected in volume two of Randolph Churchill's life of his father (finished by Martin Gilbert). I was hoping to find room this week for some further discussion of haddock sandwiches, but in the interests of historical scholarship I have given terminology pride of place.

      "body": "<p>One of this week's newspaper accounts of the consultation document on the corporal punishment of children said that the government approved of parents smacking their children's bottoms, but only if they did it \"in a loving way\". I have seldom heard anything more creepy. Anyone who can smack a child in a loving way has something seriously wrong with him or her. </p> <p>There are many accepted ways of showing love, but smacking has never been one of them. In the normal course of events, a child gets smacked only when it has behaved in such a way as temporarily to forfeit a parent's love. Usually, the smacking is quickly followed by parental feelings of remorse and rapid restoration of the suspended affection, demonstrated by a big hug. </p> <p>The idea that the smacking itself can be a loving act is most unwholesome. In fact, I find it impossible to justify any form of corporal punishment that is carried out coldly, with the child's improvement as its only purpose. For smacking to be acceptable, there has to be an element of anger involved. The child must have driven its mother or father to a point of exasperation at which no other response seems possible. Smacking is a parental cry for help. It is a message to the child, saying, \"Please stop baiting me, please don't wind me up; I just can't handle it any more.\" And smacking can be effective in getting this message across to the child, provided, of course, it is not overdone. The absolutely essential quality in parents who resort to smacking is to be able to express their anger spontaneously but with instinctive self-control. </p> <p>Dr Liam Fox, the shadow health secretary, clearly disagrees with all that. He shares with many people in this country the traditional view that the corporal punishment of children is a vital disciplinary tool. Commenting on the government's proposal to legislate against it in all its forms except for the infliction of mild pain by hands on bottoms, Dr Fox tried to give the impression that the government wanted to ban smacking, too. At any rate, what he said was, \"Smacking children to teach them the difference between right and wrong is often a necessary, if painful, task.\" This is in line with the claim schoolmasters used to make in the days when they were still allowed to beat their pupils - that the beating hurt them more than it hurt the child. Few people ever believed them then, and few people are likely to believe Dr Fox now when he portrays corporal punishment as a painful parental duty that is only performed for the good of the child. </p> <p>As the Guardian has chillingly noted, statistics show that at least one child dies in Britain every week from physical injuries inflicted by an adult, whereas in Sweden, where corporal punishment of any kind has been illegal for more than 20 years, only four children have died of such treatment during that entire period. The contrast is startling, and it would seem to reinforce the case of those who would have us follow the example of the six European countries that have already banned smacking. As with the zero-tolerance policy imposed by New York's Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who claims to have reduced serious crime in the city by clamping down on tiny offences such as dropping litter, perhaps serious assaults on children would be reduced in Britain by banning even the gentle smack on the bottom. It would certainly concentrate people's minds to know that striking a child in any fashion might land them in jail. </p> <p>On the other hand, there are strong arguments against such a ban. One is that even more British people think parents should be allowed to smack their children than the majority who want to ban fox-hunting. The opinion polls are very clear on this. Practically everyone wants greater protection for foxes than for children. That is the British way. Another reason for keeping smacking legal is that we don't want to criminalise too many parents. The polls showing 85% in favour of the right to smack children over the age of five and 53% in favour of the right to smack children over two suggest that an awful lot of parents must be doing it. </p> <p> In short, I think that the government's proposals are about right. Striking children with implements of any kind, and hitting them anywhere except on their bottoms, should, indeed, be forbidden. When I was four, I was spanked by my father - the only time I can remember him doing it - for repeatedly disturbing my mother while she was ill. To this day, it is not the spanking but the fact that he did it with a slipper that I resent. When it comes to ordinary smacking, it should be left to the courts to decide when excessive violence is used. But the courts should be especially harsh towards any parent who claims to have done it \"in a loving way\".</p>",

As the Guardian has chillingly noted, statistics show that at least one child dies in Britain every week from physical injuries inflicted by an adult, whereas in Sweden, where corporal punishment of any kind has been illegal for more than 20 years, only four children have died of such treatment during that entire period. The contrast is startling, and it would seem to reinforce the case of those who would have us follow the example of the six European countries that have already banned smacking. As with the zero-tolerance policy imposed by New York's Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who claims to have reduced serious crime in the city by clamping down on tiny offences such as dropping litter, perhaps serious assaults on children would be reduced in Britain by banning even the gentle smack on the bottom. It would certainly concentrate people's minds to know that striking a child in any fashion might land them in jail. On the other hand, there are strong arguments against such a ban. One is that even more British people think parents should be allowed to smack their children than the majority who want to ban fox-hunting. The opinion polls are very clear on this. Practically everyone wants greater protection for foxes than for children. That is the British way. Another reason for keeping smacking legal is that we don't want to criminalise too many parents. The polls showing 85% in favour of the right to smack children over the age of five and 53% in favour of the right to smack children over two suggest that an awful lot of parents must be doing it. In short, I think that the government's proposals are about right. Striking children with implements of any kind, and hitting them anywhere except on their bottoms, should, indeed, be forbidden. When I was four, I was spanked by my father - the only time I can remember him doing it - for repeatedly disturbing my mother while she was ill. To this day, it is not the spanking but the fact that he did it with a slipper that I resent. When it comes to ordinary smacking, it should be left to the courts to decide when excessive violence is used. But the courts should be especially harsh towards any parent who claims to have done it \"in a loving way\".",

Get on with it. \"and she had this enormous spoon and she'd be stirring and putting in pepper_\" Is there much more of this? \"And she always had a cigarette in her mouth.\" Mmm, I see. I believe I'm on the point of spotting the punchline. Something to do with fag ash as seasoning, perhaps? And so it turned out. Surely, if you're going to have a programme presumptuously entitled The Unforgettable Hattie Jacques (ITV), you have to do better than this. </p> <p>Let's try again. In one of the Carry On films (she appeared in 14 of them), Jacques breathed in and filled her matron's starched uni form. Kenneth Williams breathed in through flared nostrils and barely filled his pigeon chest. It was a very arch moment, and four impossibly raised eyebrows rather proved the point. \"The younger birds may be soft and tender,\" Matron told Dr Williams, saucily, \"but the older birds have more on them.\" With that she wafted out. Williams inflated his nostrils still further and eyed her departing back narrowly: \"True, and they need a lot more stuffing.\" </p> <p>And again, in another Carry On, to sarcastic, elephantine tuba music, Jacques stood sadly on a pair of scales: \"Who would have thought that a cow would have made all the difference?\" Pah, pah, paaaah, commented the tuba. </p> <p>Despite the gravy and stuffing, this was an unexpectedly affecting memoir. Best of the talking heads was Bob Monkhouse: \"Her career was greatly helped as regards regular employment by her weight,\" he recognised. He realised, too, though, that her comic talents were hardly exploited: most Carry Ons were written by jokesmiths rather than script writers, by men who couldn't create living, breathing characters to save their lives. </p> <p>Throughout that career, she was the fat woman on the receiving end of the obvious punchline. Like Mollie Sugden as Mrs Slocombe, Jacques was always the battleaxe, hungry for sex but doomed to a life of frustration. And like Sugden, Jacques was pitted against the pneumatic dolly. For Sugden it was Wendy Richard as Miss Brahms; for Jacques, it was Barbara Windsor as pert as you like in a bikini. Instead of sex, Jacques would have to learn to reconcile herself to a career of put-downs from Bernard Bresslaw and his ilk. </p> <p>Worse, for 19 years Jacques was Eric Sykes's on-screen sister. As Monkhouse noted, in Sykes she had to create a role for herself; Sykes's scripts only offered a foil for the funny man. Nonetheless, she was still the sex-starved loser: in one scene from Sykes he spotted a lonely hearts ad with a familiar phone number. \"Good-looking women don't put their numbers in the paper,\" said Sykes. Hang on, though. What was that noise? The phone ringing. A call for the good-looking, slender woman whom Jacques had invented for the ad. \"Hello,\" she breathed into the receiver. For that moment she was Marlene Dietrich, though more louche. </p> <p>Life was not like her screen roles, not like that unlivable existence imagined by male screenwriters. Friends queued up to tell what a sensual sexpot she was in real life, and to reveal that men, unimagined by the writers of Carry On and Sykes, fancied her rotten. Which was nice. She left that eternal faded public- school playboy John Le Mesurier for an entrepreneur called John Scofield. The home-movie footage of her new lover showed him to be a hunk - in winter, square-shouldered and granite-jawed in a camel coat; in summer, a Greek god striding through the surf in negligible trunk.

Yet this can't be true, or there wouldn't be such a market for cassettes of old radio comedy programmes. </p> <p>Graffoe's audience was less inclined towards hilarity, too. And his own performance had slowed considerably, lacking the sharp edge that characterised his Comedy Store gig. But isn't this where the skills of a producer are supposed to come into play? </p> <p>Just when I was beginning to fear that my stash of old laughs wouldn't last the month, along came Revolting People - a sitcom set in Baltimore in 1770, during the American War of Independence. Imagine pitching that to a controller: who but Woody Allen or Mel Brooks would stand a chance? The extraordinary thing is that Jay Tarses, the chap who plays the hero, shopkeeper Sam Oliphant, and is also co-writer, sounds very like Allen himself. </p> <p>Indeed, this is Baltimore as seen from Brooklyn. Oliphant is a self-deprecating loser who, as he fends off English troops, tries to avoid telling his daughter that her fiance is a pompous prat, and fails to sell any of his wares. He is all bathos and crisp punchlines. There are some pretty predictable gags, but Tarses is terrific. </p> <p>More wit came from The O'Show, a comedy sketch show billed as featuring \"the cream of Ireland's new comedians\". With sketches about decommissioning and confession, they're clearly declaring that nothing is out of bounds. I particularly enjoyed the gag about the website that allows virtual marching for Oranges. Their use of catchphrases is canny, too. \"I had you - I don't believe you fell for that\", is the gleeful Irish cry whenever they manage to dupe their peers, no matter how solemn the occasion. </p> <p>Everyone wants to be the new Goodness Gracious Me, but this show has a legitimate claim in that direction.

Blair would probably threaten that the money would have to be diverted from RUC resources. On the evidence, inquiries would offer better value.

Some months ago, the dog became ill with tumours, which was what my dad had died of. On January 8, Benny joined the majority. On the 10th, my mum followed him. </p> <p>There seems to be something so inevitable, so cosy, about this that an untoward show of grief would seem selfish and silly. It hurts to be stuck here like a lemon without them but, hey, you have to try and take the long view. </p> <p>\"Are you in shock?\" some of my friends have asked me, but I don't reckon I am. I've had a good snivel, alone or with my boyfriend - and you do feel a bit better afterwards, like a radiator that has been bled. However, my very warm, very kind, very working-class extended family made it clear to me within an hour of my mother's death that blubbing en g\u00e9n\u00e9ral wasn't the thing to do at all. </p> <p>\"You're going to have to be a bit braver than this, Julie!\" snapped my Auntie Dolly, a saint of a woman, when I tried it on when we were driving home from the hospital. </p> <p>\"Y-y-yes,\" I stuttered like a brave little soldier. Then I blurted, \"Auntie Doll, do you believe in an afterlife?\" </p> <p>\"No!\" came the answer from the front seat. \"Once you're dead, you're dead!\" </p> <p>I went mulishly silent at this. \"There is too an afterlife!\" I thought to myself. I believe very much in life after death, very much in the conventional mode of soft mists and eternal content, and can easily imagine my mum, dad and dog romping through some celestial meadow together, like in some Timotei advert. I suspect that I may have spent too much time at Sunday school as a child, but too late to change that now. It keeps me happy - and, anyway, I'm not the one rushing out in search of grief counselling. </p> <p>The thing is that not giving in to grief does actually make you feel happier. You know that the dead person wouldn't want you to be sad and - supposing I'm right and there is an afterlife - it's going to be raining on their parade a bit, to say the least, if they're up there having the time of their (after) lives and they can see you, whom they loved, carrying on like Niagara down here, isn't it? </p> <p>I'd started out whining, \"I can't do anything! I don't know what to do!\" and yet, after just a little bit of a scolding, I had the funeral booked, the organ, cornea and skin transplants signed for and going ahead, and the death notice in the paper, all within 24 hours. </p> <p>What I'm saying is, if I can do it, anyone can - and they don't half make you feel better, all those formalities and tidying-up jobs. </p> <p>But, according to George Monbiot, I'm not doing myself any favours. In his opinion, it would bode a lot better for my future mental health if I were to \"kiss and embrace corpses, wailing and keening, paying tribute to the undeniably dead\", as the ever-estimable \"other cultures\" do. </p> <p>His argument reminded me of a Victoria Wood joke that was intended to show up the passionlessness of the British: \"In India when a man dies,\" she said, \"his widow throws herself on the funeral pyre. Over here, she says, 'Fifty ham baps, Beryl - you slice, I'll butter.'\" </p> <p>But in reality, of course, those widows are thrown on to their dead husbands' funeral pyres - they don't jump. I know which alternative I prefer, and also which shows the most respect for life. </p> <p> Later in the same article, Mr Monbiot approves warmly of the Dani people of West Papua, for whom the dead, he explains, are everywhere. Apparently, when the living sit around at home of an evening, they leave spaces for all of the dead members of the family, and even give them as much tobacco and as much food as they give to the living. </p> <p>I'm sorry, but I just do not believe this. For instance, where do they draw the line? Surely, as time goes on, there is simply not enough room for all the dead Dani ancestors to crowd into those modest-sized huts of their living relatives - it's not for nothing that they are called \"the majority\", after all. Also, I'm sure that food and tobacco aren't so plentiful in West Papua that the Dani can afford to waste it nightly on a bunch of fussy eaters - ie, the Dead. What's more, I really don't see why I should respect this tradition any more than I would a childless western couple who nevertheless leave out a mince pie and a glass of Bailey's Irish Cream for Santa Claus every December 24. </p> <p>Far from suggesting an ease with death, such gluts of weeping, wailing and generally having the ab-dabs - whether in Mexico, Mombasa or Morecambe - surely signal its exact opposite: a childish refusal to accept death as part of life, but rather to view it as something that is perpetually shocking and upsetting.

This is misleading.</p> <p>In 1998 the budget for the project was increased to \u00a366.3m from the \u00a355.7m estimate made three years earlier at the time of application for lottery grants. This was a conscious decision to ensure the project delivered its objectives in terms of quality and public benefit. It did not reflect loss of control and was not an overspend. The programme is on time and budget. The Royal Albert Hall has never asked for additional lottery grants and is confident it can provide all the partnership funding required to complete its development programme. <br> <b> David Elliott </b> <br> Chief executive, Royal Albert Hall</p> <p>\u0095 The Arts Council is certainly not a bottomless pit. Our lottery capital programme is heavily over-subscribed and we have to reject half of all applications. We only award supplementary grants after rigorous scrutiny. We monitor projects closely - and if we have concerns we take immediate action. The Public Accounts Committee looked at a report by the national audit office into 15 of our largest, most complex and earliest lottery awards. They represent less than 1% of the awards we have made. All the recommendations made by the NAO have been implemented. Since the lottery began we have continuously improved our procedures to ensure our limited funds are well spent. <br><b> Peter Hewitt </b><br> Chief executive, The Arts Council of England</p> <p>\u0095 So London is swallowing nearly all arts sponsorship money from the business world? (Regions lose out in arts dash for cash, January 18) The fat cats are in central, not regional London.The ability of London-based national organisations to raise fortunes, and to spend considerable sums in doing so, will be much enhanced when the treasury brings in its intended tax write-off for arts donations in April.</p> <p>That would be fine if government funding redressed the balance for the smaller organisations who can't afford fundraisers. However, the signs are not good. In the next financial year the government has increased the grant by \u00a310m to the Arts Council, which has managed to find \u00a37.5m for 10 organisations in metropolitan London. This prompts the usual refrain \"It's the rich wot gets the gravy\". <br><b> Philip Hedley</b><br> Artistic director, Theatre Royal Stratford East London</p>",

      "bodyText": "Your report on arts spending (Arts Council a bottomless pit, say MPs, January 20) refers to \"a \u00a39m overspend on the \u00a357m Royal Albert Hall refurbishment\" as one of the worst examples of lack of spending control on our Arts Council lottery project. This is misleading. In 1998 the budget for the project was increased to \u00a366.3m from the \u00a355.7m estimate made three years earlier at the time of application for lottery grants. This was a conscious decision to ensure the project delivered its objectives in terms of quality and public benefit. It did not reflect loss of control and was not an overspend. The programme is on time and budget. The Royal Albert Hall has never asked for additional lottery grants and is confident it can provide all the partnership funding required to complete its development programme. David Elliott Chief executive, Royal Albert Hall \u0095 The Arts Council is certainly not a bottomless pit. Our lottery capital programme is heavily over-subscribed and we have to reject half of all applications. We only award supplementary grants after rigorous scrutiny. We monitor projects closely - and if we have concerns we take immediate action. The Public Accounts Committee looked at a report by the national audit office into 15 of our largest, most complex and earliest lottery awards. They represent less than 1% of the awards we have made. All the recommendations made by the NAO have been implemented. Since the lottery began we have continuously improved our procedures to ensure our limited funds are well spent. Peter Hewitt Chief executive, The Arts Council of England \u0095 So London is swallowing nearly all arts sponsorship money from the business world? (Regions lose out in arts dash for cash, January 18) The fat cats are in central, not regional London.The ability of London-based national organisations to raise fortunes, and to spend considerable sums in doing so, will be much enhanced when the treasury brings in its intended tax write-off for arts donations in April. That would be fine if government funding redressed the balance for the smaller organisations who can't afford fundraisers. However, the signs are not good. In the next financial year the government has increased the grant by \u00a310m to the Arts Council, which has managed to find \u00a37.5m for 10 organisations in metropolitan London. This prompts the usual refrain \"It's the rich wot gets the gravy\". Philip Hedley Artistic director, Theatre Royal Stratford East London",

Without any doubt, lesbian and gay pupils face horrific bullying in schools and the repeal of section 28 would at last give teachers the opportunity, through the promotion of education and understanding, to end such appalling discrimination. It is incumbent upon us to make certain that homophobia is stopped in its tracks because the damage it inflicts casts a shadow across every single one of us. Michael Cashman MEP",

It is not the fault of the foreign office that we are selling arms to Zimbabwe at this wholly inappropriate moment, but it has certainly blown a huge hole in Robin Cook's ethical foreign policy. John Prescott, who came to office determined to be tough on traffic and tough on the causes of traffic, has been forced to retreat. The home office looks like a battlefield: here, the dispatch of Pinochet, on medical grounds we are not allowed to see; there, Tyson admitted on unquantified \"compassionate\" grounds; down the road, a woolly uprising in defence of trial by jury, inflicting a defeat which has wrecked the home secretary's bill. His minimalist approach to Labour's election pledge on freedom of information is part of the same disease. Mr Straw is a decent man, but his use of \"liberal\" as a term of abuse - even when qualified by \"woolly\" and \"Hampstead\" - suggests contempt for a system of values close to the heart of the Labour movement and much of the Labour vote.

It does real harm when some ministers publicly urge us towards the euro while others keep mum and still others are plainly sceptical; when some departments want to sell arms and others are out to stop them; when the prime minister, promising generous help for the the beleaguered NHS, leaves other departments fearful for their allocations and the treasury in a torment over the implications for its spending programme.</p> <p>When troubles like these become evident in so many parts of a store, shareholders start asking questions about top management.

New Labour, new Britain, involves a radical assault on the forces of conservatism everywhere, but especially those which shape our government structures. So Labour came in with the promise of perhaps the biggest constitutional shake-up in history. Scotland and Wales were to have a form of home rule. London first, then other cities, would elect their own leaders. That wretched anachronism, the right of hereditary peers to speak and vote in parliament on no other qualification than their privileged birth, would at last be expunged. Even first-past-the-post would no longer be sacrosanct. But New Labour's instincts pull in different directions: one way towards devolution, the other towards control. So self-government for Wales - but don't choose Rhodri Morgan. A mayor for London - but you must not pick Ken Livingstone. A reformed second chamber - but not one which will cause us trouble. Mr Blair's reaction to defeat by the Lords over juries tells us all we need to know about his motivation there. \"Profoundly undemocratic,\" he calls it. What he wants is a second chamber which can always be called \"profoundly undemocratic\" when it stands in the way of what the government wants. Therefore it can't be elected.</p> <p>There is, in Mr Blair as well as in Mr Straw, too much impugning of opponents' motives, so that anyone who differs becomes a force of conservatism.

He looked genuinely troubled. That, he said, is my responsibility; I have to see it does not occur again. That moment of candour, that total absence of self-exculpation, was worth any amount of highly paid spin-doctoring. Yet gradually, the public discovers it is being lied to; that the extent of the flu epidemic is being played up to make the NHS crisis look exceptional rather than routine; that despite government claims to the contrary, Lord Winston did say what the New Statesman claimed he said about the NHS.</p> <p>Mr Blair is right: it is the vision that counts. You can find abundant evidence, in the pledges to deal with poverty, in Gordon Brown's commitment to redistribution (even if, to the government's shame, it cannot admit it because of its hang-up on taxes) that the kind of vision the left was looking for all those years is still there amidst all the centrist rhetoric and centrist practice. But when Mr Blair tries to dismiss the government's troubles as if they were local difficulties, we should not be fooled, and neither should he. To return to the high street parallel: there's no Tesco just down the road in this story, no vibrant, coherent opposition. The Tories, and not only on Europe, are a coalition that has collapsed. Faced with an issue causing real public distress, the state of the NHS, their only response is to yak away about giving the private sector its head.

You can wave legal papers; some take a lot of notice and are sympathetic while others ignore you.\"</p> <p>She suffers from an addiction to illegal lotteries and phoney prize schemes. Last week, she received 46 letters about such schemes at her home. These included missives from the Consumer Enrichment Centre, which operates from a London post box address, which appears to say she had won \u00a36,000; the North American Award Center in Missouri; the National Audit Centre in Unionville Ontario; Paragon Worldwide Lotto Fund in Nova Scotia, and from the grandly named Award Determination Tribunal at the Office of Internal Audits at United Equity Ltd, which can be tracked back to a post office box number in Ashford, Middlesex.</p> <p>Dr Waskett says his great aunt has spent more than \u00a36,500 on these schemes and never received a penny. He is unhappy with the way HSBC took no action when he alerted it to her use of a full chequebook in less than a week, all on these catchpenny plans.

NatWest was understanding with the chequebook but said it would have to give her money over the counter if she asked. Then she went to the Co-op. They allowed her to open an account but were very decent when I showed them the document and they agreed to close the account.\"</p> <p>The problem bank was HSBC which refused to talk to Dr Waskett without his relation present. This, he says, is pointless given her personality and condition.</p> <p>Although she was going through chequebooks in a week, HSBC let her build up an overdraft of \u00a33,500, gave her a credit card and then suggested she took out a personal loan.</p> <p>Dr Waskett found that because she was reasonably well off - a widow with a house worth \u00a3200,000 and shares - her credit rating was perfect and she could easily borrow against the value of her property. Now in her late seventies, she has also reversed the enduring power of attorney - as is her legal right - on occasions. That allows her to borrow more. HSBC's headquarters in London now says it regrets the problem and would like to discuss the affair with Dr Waskett.</p> <p>Helen Parsons from Stroud, Gloucestershire, is hoping her local MP David Drew will put forward an amendment to the Financial Services and Markets Bill to protect the elderly. Her mother, Ruth Waterhouse, who died last year, was persuaded to buy an annuity on her husband's life in 1992 by a firm of accountants. The Standard Life policy was designed for a high immediate payment but was worthless when the holder died - there was no guarantee of a minimum payout.</p> <p>Ms Parsons says: \"She was blind in one eye, and had a cataract on the other. She would not have been capable of reading the small print. She ticked the wrong box. My late father was very ill and died nine months later. The loss on the \u00a340,000 policy was around \u00a336,000.\"</p> <p>Last September the north London accountants had to pay fines and costs totalling \u00a316,500 when an Institute of Chartered Accountants tribunal upheld complaints from this case. But the family's attempt to gain compensation has run into a legal dead-end. Ms Parsons says: \"I feel guilty that I was not there. I shall never forgive myself. She should have had someone to help her.\"</p> <p>But legal protection and restrictions have to be balanced against civil liberties of the elderly, including the freedom to spend their money in ways others might think unwise. \"It's a very complicated legal and policy area,\" says Alexandra Mason, a lawyer specialising in enduring power of attorney and court of protection issues.</p> <p>\"You can start from the proposition that the elderly can be vulnerable but you must still recognise that they may be capable of managing their finances and property as well as someone younger.\"</p> <p>Governments of both complexions have been wrestling with the issue of elderly and other people who are not in full possession of their faculties. A Law Commission report in 1995 was followed by a consultation paper Who Decides in 1997. Firmer proposals came late last year in Making Decisions and looked at:</p> <p>* Defining mental capacity and the person's best interests - around one in five 80 year olds has some degree of mental power loss, according to Help the Aged;</p> <p>* Replacing enduring powers of attorney with continuous powers of attorney - the old system limits powers to money and property, while the proposed continuous system would extend to medical care and daily life issues;</p> <p>* Modernising the court of protection so it could resolve disputes about a person's mental condition.</p> <p>But these will be enacted only \"when parliamentary time allows\" and offer no help to the vulnerable as opposed to the \"mentally incapacitated.\"</p> <p>At Help the Aged, Mervyn Kohler says \"there will be reforms at some stage, but don't bet on when. The whole area is one that people do not want to talk about and it's never the most urgent issue.\"</p> <p>Mr Kohler believes that the law surrounding enduring powers of attorney can present problems, especially when the subject is \"devious\". There is no central register or clearing house so those with the powers have to show their papers to everyone.</p> <p>One idea would be to copy the driving licence scheme with its compulsory renewals for the over 70s and insist on regular checks on anyone over 70 to see if they are still capable of signing financial and other contracts. The government could also set up a \"public guardian service, though that would be costly.</p> <p>But the Human Rights Act, which comes into force this October, could throw the whole issue in the air. It will establish that the rights of the individual are paramount, including the right to live an unfettered life and enjoy one's property.</p> <p>So it could be extremely difficult to persuade someone to give up their financial and other powers.

The past couple of years has seen a steady rise in a new breed of landlord as working people have taken advantage of buy-to-let mortgages. Encouraged by low interest rates, they have bought properties and rented them out hoping to make a long-term investment and a nice little monthly income.</p> <p>Now there are signs that the buy-to-let bubble has burst. The south-east has seen the largest increase in the number of properties coming on to the rental market. In some areas there is a glut of properties for rent and tenants can be choosy. In a competitive market scruffy one- and two-bedroom flats fall by the wayside as tenants go for smarter homes.</p> <p>An over-supply of property for rent also leads to more \"voids\" between tenants for landlords. The mortgage still must be paid but the owners can go for weeks without a tenant. Agents Knight Frank say the supply of rental property, mostly one- and two-bedroom flats in greater London, increased by about 25% in 1999. \"In many London locations private investors have been lured by the \"promise\" of double-digit returns across residential property held as an investment,\" says the agent. \"This is no longer achievable as the supply of rented property has increased but rental levels have not kept pace.\"</p> <p>But some areas are faring better. At the heart of the capital Knight Frank branches say tenants are desperate for properties to rent. And in urban areas around Britain there are now two kinds of investors in the market - the sophisticated investor and the unsophisticated landlord. Sophisticated investors have researched the market and are fully aware of all the factors that can make a dent in their profits such as maintenance costs and having to pay the mortgage for an average of eight weeks a year when the flat is empty.</p> <p>The unsophisticated landlords have been lured by reports of gross yields of more than 10%. They take out the mortgage with a deposit as low as 5%. With an increase in interest rates and a couple of no-rent months they can find themselves having to top up the mortgages out of their own pockets.</p> <p>John Lee, national sales manager with the Halifax, echoes this: \"There is not the same large profit margin on rental income now. As a result, customers taking out a buy-to-let mortgage are changing. People are still coming in but we haven't got as many amateur landlords as we had,\" he says.</p> <p>Instead, the bank has been lending to people who own and let up to six properties. \"They're going for a standard variable rate rather than a fixed rate because they don't want to have to pay redemption charges if they want to sell,\" he says.</p> <p>Graham Wilby, who oversees buy-to-let for the Woolwich, has also seen a change. \"More and more people are building up a portfolio of properties and becoming serious landlords. Now 40% of our business in buy-to-let is repeats, arranging mortgages for existing clients.\"</p> <p>Figures collected by the Centre for Housing Policy at the University of York show that rents have been increasing in line with inflation. But the rise in house prices means that would-be landlords are having to pay more for properties compared to what they recoup in rent. On a monthly basis, renting looks less attractive than it did, but landlords in for the long haul will reap the benefits of a capital growth in the value of the property.</p> <p>Mr Wilby says returns aren't too bad. \"Someone buying a \u00a370,000 property should get a gross rent of \u00a37,000 on that.\" Experts agree that the answer to the question: \"Will buying-to-let make me rich?\" is: \"No - not yet,\" but if you're happy to stick with it for 10 years and ride out the bad times then you'll amass a nice little nest egg. As Mr Lee says: \"More and more people are looking to the capital growth of the property and are happy for the rental to cover the mortgage and maintenance costs.\"</p> <p>If house prices continue upwards and lenders put interest rates up in a bid to keep the lid on the economy, then buy-to-let will be a less attractive option in six months' time, says Graham Wilby.

An indication of rising stress levels is the increase in the number of stress-related workplace injury claims. Figures from the Trades Union Congress (TUC), show a 70% rise in the number of cases handled by their lawyers between 1998 and 1999.</p> <p>Tom Jones, a partner at Thompsons, the UK's largest personal injury law firm, backs this up. \"They have gone through the roof in terms of the number of inquiries over the last couple of years,\" he says.</p> <p>But how do you know if you are suffering from stress and what can you do about it? The first question is not easy to answer. Where do you draw the line between pressure, generally considered to be a healthy element of employment, and stress? The Health &amp; Safety Executive (HSE), the body responsible for enforcing the Health and Safety at Work Act of 1974, offers a guide to managers on work-related stress available at <a href=\"http://www.hse.gov.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.hse.gov.uk</a>. This says the difference between pressure and stress is that the former improves performance while the latter leads to illness. It describes a set of symptoms a stressed employee might exhibit: irritability, indecisiveness, absenteeism and reduced performance. Stressed staff may also start taking more and more sick days, or frequently turn up late.</p> <p>Unison, the largest trade union in the UK with 1.3m members mainly in the public sector, won the first case ever in which an employee was awarded damages by his employers on the grounds of stress. Unison defines stress as: \"The reaction people have to excessive demands or pressures arising when people cope with tasks, responsibilities or other types of pressure connected with their jobs, but find difficulty, strain or worry in doing so.\"</p> <p>But any one of the symptoms described by the HSE could arise for any number of reasons. Equally, Unison's definition describes circumstances that many workers deal with on a regular basis who do not suffer from stress. What is more, as the HSE points out in its guide, \"symptoms of stress tend to be seen as a sign of weak ness\". Where this is the case, it becomes self-perpetuating, with anxieties about one's performance exacerbating existing problems.</p> <p>Unison says the best tip it can offer is to act early. If you feel that the tasks allotted to you are too much and you are suffering a significant number of the symptoms mentioned above, inform your line manager. Failing to do so means that the problem will not be officially recorded - a fact which will not help in the instance of any legal action - and help will only be forthcoming if your employers happen to notice.</p> <p>Sadly, this will not always be the end of the problem. Mr Jones cites the case of a member of staff at a large city council forced to take time off work because of stress-related illness. He had started work as a joiner and was made manager of the works division without the necessary training. On his return after sick leave one of his bosses greeted him by saying: \"I hope you've got plenty of Valium because we've got plenty of work for you.\"</p> <p>This sort of \"crass management\", as Mr Jones calls it, is particularly common among public sector organisations. \"It has tended to be surprisingly and massively present in local government,\" says Mr Jones. \"I say surprisingly because you might expect that area to be a backwater.\" It is the imposition of private sector-style management that leads to the problem, says Mr Jones.</p> <p>Even if someone is convinced they are suffering to the extent that it is damaging their health, fighting for compensation will not be simple, quick or easy. The legal process is expensive. The best source of help is a trade union, which will supply free legal services. If you are not a union member the only other source of financial help is legal aid. In order to qualify you must pass a means test and a merit test, the latter to establish whether there is a chance of the case succeeding. If during the case the Legal Aid Board decides that failure is on the cards, the support will be withdrawn.</p> <p>This facility will be all but withdrawn in April anyway, when legal aid in personal injury cases will be replaced by conditional fee agreements under the Access to Justice Act. These agreements are effectively an insurance policy against losing a case which the applicant must pay for. If the case is lost the costs will be paid on behalf of the applicant. If the case is won the losing side will pay. Mr Jones says it is not unusual for cases to drag on for three or four years at a cost of tens of thousands of pounds.</p> <p>Despite the record award of \u00a3203,000 made last week, awards are not generous. The principle governing compensation is that the recipient should be put in a financial position as close as possible to that they would have been in if the damage had not occured. In physical injury cases calculations are based on something called the Ogden tables. In stress cases no such model exists, so, Mr Jones says: \"Employers offer a sum they think they can get away with but it will be substantially less than you would get in a trial.\"</p> <p>Peter Graham, senior claims manager at Norwich Union, which insures companies against compensation cases, says the intention is to minimise additional stress by making a reasonable offer as early as possible. Out of court settlements tend to favour employers. And they avoid setting legal precedents, which makes it harder for future applicants.</p> <p>But the HSE is discussing the introduction of a code of practice on stress which would put the burden of proof on an offender. Whether anything comes of this will become clear in April.</p> <p>\u0095 Useful sources of information: TUC's Know Your Rights line, 0870-6004882; Citizens' Advice Bureaux, 0171-833 2181.

On his return after sick leave one of his bosses greeted him by saying: \"I hope you've got plenty of Valium because we've got plenty of work for you.\" This sort of \"crass management\", as Mr Jones calls it, is particularly common among public sector organisations. \"It has tended to be surprisingly and massively present in local government,\" says Mr Jones. \"I say surprisingly because you might expect that area to be a backwater.\" It is the imposition of private sector-style management that leads to the problem, says Mr Jones. Even if someone is convinced they are suffering to the extent that it is damaging their health, fighting for compensation will not be simple, quick or easy. The legal process is expensive. The best source of help is a trade union, which will supply free legal services. If you are not a union member the only other source of financial help is legal aid. In order to qualify you must pass a means test and a merit test, the latter to establish whether there is a chance of the case succeeding. If during the case the Legal Aid Board decides that failure is on the cards, the support will be withdrawn. This facility will be all but withdrawn in April anyway, when legal aid in personal injury cases will be replaced by conditional fee agreements under the Access to Justice Act. These agreements are effectively an insurance policy against losing a case which the applicant must pay for. If the case is lost the costs will be paid on behalf of the applicant. If the case is won the losing side will pay. Mr Jones says it is not unusual for cases to drag on for three or four years at a cost of tens of thousands of pounds. Despite the record award of \u00a3203,000 made last week, awards are not generous. The principle governing compensation is that the recipient should be put in a financial position as close as possible to that they would have been in if the damage had not occured. In physical injury cases calculations are based on something called the Ogden tables. In stress cases no such model exists, so, Mr Jones says: \"Employers offer a sum they think they can get away with but it will be substantially less than you would get in a trial.\" Peter Graham, senior claims manager at Norwich Union, which insures companies against compensation cases, says the intention is to minimise additional stress by making a reasonable offer as early as possible. Out of court settlements tend to favour employers. And they avoid setting legal precedents, which makes it harder for future applicants. But the HSE is discussing the introduction of a code of practice on stress which would put the burden of proof on an offender. Whether anything comes of this will become clear in April. \u0095 Useful sources of information: TUC's Know Your Rights line, 0870-6004882; Citizens' Advice Bureaux, 0171-833 2181.

But remember that your cough must sound as though you're starting a chainsaw in cold weather, and that you must cough at least three times during any phone call to the office. Declaring that you've a temperature really isn't good enough; you have to have a raging fever of 120F.

So if I tell you that I'm thinking of having all my hair surgically extracted, you'll know that my nightmares also feature physical contact with armed strangers and a big chair that pumps up and down. \"Would you like it just touching the ears, sir?\" Arrrghhhhhhh!</p> <p>I blurted my fears to Christine the very first time she did me. \"Not been for a while?\" she asked as I stepped nervously forward. Not been recently? It was like being potty trained again. To be honest, I told her, I'd rather go to the dentist than have my hair cut. \"You're kidding?\" I guess nobody had ever been afraid of her before (Christine wasn't very big). She thought it was so funny that she very nearly forgot to tell me about her holiday in St Lucia.</p> <p>It's lucky she remembered, because I quickly learned the secret of how to relax as she snipped around me. Just ask her about her holidays. \"Been away?\" I'd say, as she tightened the nylon sheet around my neck. \"Going anywhere nice?\" Her grip would loosen, and she'd be off down that runway in a haze of jet exhaust, leaving me to gaze like Dorian Gray at my ageing head and shoulders (it's always frightening what a difference just another six months has made). Occasionally, she'd pause, mid-destination, to ask my opinion about a parting or somesuch - you know that stuff hairdressers seem obsessed with. Her reflection would address my reflection in the mirror, and I'd leave the pair of them to agree on the details. And that was the conversation bit more or less taken care of.</p> <p>That's almost the worst part, you see. Not that I have a problem with conversation generally. But in front of a mirror, in a raised-up chair, with just my head poking through a sheet like a cherry on a knickerbocker glory, and my hair all dripping and plastered down at the front, Hitler-style . . . \"Leave me alone,\" is all I want to say. \"Can't you see I'm having a bad-hair life?\" But still they want to talk. \"Working hard?\" Not until I came in here. \"Live locally?\" No, I live in New York, but thought I'd fly over to the East Midlands just so I could get my hair done by Joyce in Headz-U-Win.</p> <p>You don't get any of that with dentists. For a start, they know that you're afraid, so they're not expecting banter. Who goes to the dentist for a natter? It's just not practicable. The first thing a dentist does is ask if you've been having any problems with your teeth. Then, as you attempt to answer (\"That's for me to know and you to find out, O Evil One!\"), they stuff a wad of rolled-up blotting paper into the groove where your gums meet your mouth, clamp a gurgly suction pipe under your tongue and begin reciting the alphabet loudly to the nurse. My last dentist actually turned the enforced dumbness of his victims into a sort of comedy routine. \"So,\" he would say, having filled your mouth with metal and injected your gums with the sort of stuff hunter-gatherers use to paralyse rhinos and hunter-gatherers from neighbouring villages, \"the Conservatives seem to be doing a jolly good job, eh?\"</p> <p>And as you tried to form words using only your diaphragm and neck muscles, his masked, upsidedown little face would crease into delirious giggles.</p> <p>Christine, of course, knew exactly what she was doing. After seven years, she even had me making minor decisions about sideburn length and conditioner. But she knew I couldn't remain with her forever. Sooner or later, I'd have to return to the wild. The day she broke the news that she was going to become a psychiatrist, she tried her best to help. \"The next person who cuts your hair,\" she said, \"just tell them you want a number four on the back and sides, and the top layered in.\" Could she write it down?

If you voice any criticism, you are bad (whatever your motives); approve of it, and you are good. She does not confront the Muslim myth of supreme tolerance of other cultures. No mention of the destruction of pre-Islamic arts and cultures in areas invaded by Muslim armies, or the second-class status afforded to populations that did not submit to the faith. The west is confronting the skeletons in it's cupboard. Muslims have yet to start. <br> <b> MS Akhtar</b> <br> London SE17</p> <p>Sacred Beauty was the first positive thing your paper has published about Muslims in a long time. More often than not, you feature a handful of fanatics and weirdos who purport to represent the Muslim community. This may be partly our own fault, as academics and professionals in our community have stood aside while a minority of extremists have monopolised media attention. I hope that Ms Alibhai-Brown's article marks the start of a more balanced coverage of Muslims and Islam. <br> <b> MA Syed</b> <br> Norwich</p> <p>Jon Ronson writes about the Monster Raving Loony Party (Beyond A Joke, January 15). In the same issue, your fashion pages include a 'Rainbow woolly hat' at \u00a3109 from Harrods. Who are the monster raving loonies? <br> <b> Paulinus Barnes and Maria Pizzoni</b> <br> Rawtenstall, Lancs</p> <p>How long before one of your fashion photographers gets away with a picture in which the garment is completely out of shot (January 15)? <br> <b> Sonya Mills</b> <br> Oxford</p> <p>Michael Lewis's claim that Jim Clark's Hyperion is the 'biggest sloop ever built' (Captain Hubris, January 15) cannot go unchallenged. At 200ft overall, Nat Herreshoff's Reliance of 1903 has to be a contender - unless, of course, one were to object that she was a cutter and not a sloop. <br> <b> Jeremy E Muldowney</b> <br> Heworth, York</p> <p>Christopher Eccleston is not just being hypocritical by acting in a West End theatre following his criticism of that medium (Home Truths, January 15). His assumption that 'the kind of people who watch Jimmy McGovern's stuff on telly won't be coming' to watch him at the Theatre Royal borders on middle-class arrogance. Why shouldn't the people who enjoy Strindberg also appreciate the gritty realism of McGovern's drama? And why shouldn't the people who may have appreciated him in those TV roles not seek him out in the theatre?</p> <p>Who, exactly, is being typecast here? <br> <b> Toni Silver</b> <br> London W13</p> <p>Regarding the compostability of tea bags, Mrs Thorne (Dear Weekend, January 15) is wrong: teabags will rot; the trick is to rip them open before adding to the compost heap. <br> <b> Dr Jeff Ollerton</b> <br> School of Environmental Science University College <br> Northampton</p> <p>Sarah Gredley's child-centred home has a 'low, super-king-sized bed as family bed and trampoline', but no longer has the children's father in it (Home, January 15).

No mention of the destruction of pre-Islamic arts and cultures in areas invaded by Muslim armies, or the second-class status afforded to populations that did not submit to the faith. The west is confronting the skeletons in it's cupboard. Muslims have yet to start. MS Akhtar London SE17 Sacred Beauty was the first positive thing your paper has published about Muslims in a long time. More often than not, you feature a handful of fanatics and weirdos who purport to represent the Muslim community. This may be partly our own fault, as academics and professionals in our community have stood aside while a minority of extremists have monopolised media attention. I hope that Ms Alibhai-Brown's article marks the start of a more balanced coverage of Muslims and Islam. MA Syed Norwich Jon Ronson writes about the Monster Raving Loony Party (Beyond A Joke, January 15). In the same issue, your fashion pages include a 'Rainbow woolly hat' at \u00a3109 from Harrods. Who are the monster raving loonies?

Sonya Mills Oxford Michael Lewis's claim that Jim Clark's Hyperion is the 'biggest sloop ever built' (Captain Hubris, January 15) cannot go unchallenged. At 200ft overall, Nat Herreshoff's Reliance of 1903 has to be a contender - unless, of course, one were to object that she was a cutter and not a sloop. Jeremy E Muldowney Heworth, York Christopher Eccleston is not just being hypocritical by acting in a West End theatre following his criticism of that medium (Home Truths, January 15). His assumption that 'the kind of people who watch Jimmy McGovern's stuff on telly won't be coming' to watch him at the Theatre Royal borders on middle-class arrogance. Why shouldn't the people who enjoy Strindberg also appreciate the gritty realism of McGovern's drama? And why shouldn't the people who may have appreciated him in those TV roles not seek him out in the theatre? Who, exactly, is being typecast here? Toni Silver London W13 Regarding the compostability of tea bags, Mrs Thorne (Dear Weekend, January 15) is wrong: teabags will rot; the trick is to rip them open before adding to the compost heap.

      "body": "<p>A lesser GP would have bluffed. He'd have mumbled about red meat and long-chain molecules, drawn a whimsical analogy with the internal combustion engine, then referred me to a \"jolly good lipids man\". A cholesterol test had indicated that my blood contained an alarmingly high level of triglycerides, and a second test had confirmed the finding. Was that death's winged chariot I could hear at my back? Were too many triglycerides bad for the heart? \"I don't think anybody really knows,\" said my candid GP.</p> <p>\"Let's see what the book says.\" And, with a spin of his chair, he took an overweight volume from the shelf behind him and began turning the pages. \"Trichotillomania, tricuspid stenosis, trigeminal neuralgia... Here we are: triglyceride.\"</p> <p>This all happened several years ago, and I don't remember what the book said - only that it was vague and non-committal. My GP, it seemed, was not alone in his uncertainty. One thing he did know, of course: I needed to see a specialist. But I wasn't so sure. A specialist, I reasoned, might err too much on the side of caution. \"Frankly, old chap,\" he would say with a smile, \"there's a lot of work still to be done on this one. But to be on the safe side, you should draw up a list of everything you enjoy eating, then avoid it like the plague.\"</p> <p>A life of rumination would be my fate. A typical day on the safe side would be taken up with the steady munching of vegetables. An evening out would be pizza and side salad, minus the pizza and without any salad dressing. And to wash down this green cud? Mineral water.</p> <p>I'm not normally one to ignore professional advice, but the doctors weren't sure, for heaven's sake. I was due to move out of the area in a month, anyway. A new address, a change of GP... the Fats Police would never catch up with me. Did I want to spend my life living on the safe side?</p> <p>But no one can live in hiding forever. You might evade the medical profession, but there's no escaping the voice of reason in your own head. As the years went by, those dreadful test results haunted me. What if there was something seriously wrong? Perhaps they could fix it. Perhaps they could give me tablets. Perhaps they understood these things a little better now. Perhaps I should turn myself in.</p> <p>The nurse who extracted the blood said, with a little laugh, that she was the daughter of a dairy farmer. And as I studied the sheet of dietary advice she handed me to focus my mind in the week or so before the results came through, I could see why she found the thought amusing. There was my favourite Stilton in the \"avoid eating\" list. Camembert and brie made it into the \"once a week or less\" column, along with \"grilled back bacon (pre-boiled in water)\". Yummy! Even semi-skimmed milk was labelled \"Eat in moderation 2-3 times a week only\". How I would love to be a fly on the Yorkshire pudding when her family assembled for dinner.</p> <p>At first glance, her chart told me little that anybody who ever turned on a television or glanced at a magazine doesn't know by heart. Fruit and vegetables were the best source of nourishment, Bailey's cream liqueur the worst (when will they invent Bailey's Lite?). Fish was the food of the gods and taramasalata (fish eggs) the devil's work, while tofu and pork luncheonmeat glared at each other from opposite ends of the page. Occasionally, I would spot something that made my heart sink even deeper - crab meat was in the same category as oven chips, for instance, and both were lumped in with the liver that I had been brought up to consider the healthiest of foods.</p> <p>But this time I was going to bite the bullet (having first checked its fat content, of course). By giving free rein to my obsessive tendencies, I would show them the true meaning of lean cuisine. I'd be a model pupil - the ultimate convert. If the dieticians and nutritionists advised me to chew through two balls of string a day, then I'd be first in line when the hardware shop opened.</p> <p>And then I spotted the sunflower oil - \"Eat in moderation, once a week or less,\" it said. That couldn't be right, could it? After all, switching to sunflower oil, \"high in polyunsaturates\", had been my one major concession to nutritional correctness during the long years in hiding. Yet there it was in pink and blue, on a chart issued \"as a service to medicine\" by the drug company Pfizer and \"produced in association with the British Hypertension Society\". Corn oil, soya oil, safflower oil, grapeseed oil, peanut oil, sunflower oil, once a week or less.</p> <p>The condemnation of something previously recommended unnerved me. Why, even eggs were allowed to appear at table three times a week. What about all those Flora commercials? Had I missed something? It occurred to me that I might not, after all, be committing myself into the hands of sane people. In 1938, the British Medical Association had urged the nation to consume more dairy products, more eggs and more meat, and my own childhood diet, supplemented by lashings of free school milk (full-cream), had clearly been based on precisely that advice. One rule change in a lifetime may be regarded as a misfortune; two looks like carelessness.</p> <p>Not for the first time, I recalled the film Sleeper, and the scene in which Woody Allen wakes up in the future to be told that bran is now known to be harmful and that biscuits, chocolate and cream cakes are actually the healthiest foods. And never mind the future. Were there not dissenting voices even in the present - people who argued that fatty food no more caused heart attacks than smoking caused lung cancer?</p> <p>Our fate was predetermined by our genetic make-up, said some. Tense, fidgety types would burn up surplus fat whatever they ate, said others. And how about this? Half of Hollywood and the bulk of the fashion industry (now there's an oxymoron) was apparently living on something called the Zone Diet, a high-protein regime that demanded the consumption of burgers, steaks, butter, bacon, cheese, milk and cream, and actually banned boring bread and prissy pasta - anything, in fact, that was rich in carbohydrate. Carbs, they said, were the new fat. Perhaps these were the people I should be listening to.</p> <p>As the nurse's syringe sucked at my arm, her little chart of dietary advice worked at my brain and drained from it every drop of my new-found resolve. So nothing had changed since the last time I sat in this chair. They were still running around in the dark. But if they thought they were taking me with them, they were mistaken. They could count triglycerides until they were blue in the face. But when the letter came referring me to the specialist - when the surgery phoned, begging me to come in for an urgent chat - I'd be at lunch. Or breakfast. Or dinner. Waiter! I think I'm ready to order.</p> <p>Acouple of days later, I was still sounding off noisily to anyone within earshot when a friend, desperate to shut me up, handed me a book called The Aphrodite Diet (Vermilion, \u00a36.99). \"The cover's dreadful,\" she said, \"but you might find what's inside useful. It explains lots of stuff about fats.\" A tanned blonde in a white bikini stared out into the Aegean, wondering, no doubt, where her spare tyre had disappeared to. But beyond the cover were pie charts and bar graphs and any number of words like \"arachidonic\" and \"fibrinogen\". So I agreed to give the so-called experts one last chance.</p> <p>I secretly hoped that this would provide a convincing justification for that succulent meat-and-cream regime I'd been itching to share with Jennifer Aniston and Minnie Driver. But while the authors, Dr Artemis P Simopoulos and Jo Robinson, did have a cunning eating plan to sell - and one which argued that some types of fat, far from being the death of us, were actually an important item on the menu - it had more in common with the nurse's diet sheet than with titles such as A New Diet Revolution or Get Skinny On Fabulous Foods. One thing immediately caught my attention, however. This pair, it seemed, also wanted me to kick the sunflower oil habit.</p> <p>In fact, failure to cut down my intake of corn, soya, safflower, grapeseed, peanut and sunflower oils, and at the same time to increase my intake of rapeseed, flaxseed, walnut and fish oils might, they said, put me at risk of contracting a whole raft of ailments ranging from sundry inflammations and auto-immune diseases to heart attacks, stroke, depression and cancer.</p> <p>Cancer? What was going on here? Why was this not headline news? I read the book, then began to dig deeper, dipping into learned and not-so-learned journals, and talking to a variety of researchers. And it wasn't long before I made an important discovery about the subject of dietary fats - namely, that the processes involved are so subtle and complex that anyone can appear to prove anything simply by selecting their evidence with care. And given that, in matters of nutrition, much of the available evidence derives from studies funded by one or another rival branch of the food industry, that makes a quick tour of the subject akin to a drunken stroll through a hall of mirrors.</p> <p>At the very least, one ought to go armed with the some basic facts. So here are some to be going on with.</p> <p>The substance we call a fat is actually made up of compounds called fatty acids, attached to a backbone of glycerol (three parts fatty acid to one part glycerol equals my old friend the triglyceride - the chief form of fat obtained from plant and animal foods and stored in the body). For anyone, such as myself, whose knowledge of chemistry extends little further than a grasp of simple molecules with self-explanatory formulae such as H2O (two hydrogen atoms to every oxygen atom), this is tricky territory. The formula for linoleic acid, for example, is CH3 (CH CHCH) 3 (CH2) 7COOH. Most oils and fats contain at least a dozen of these fatty acids, and butter contains more than 100, each with different properties.</p> <p>But while no layperson should linger long on this level, a brief visit to the world of molecules does clear up one or two nagging questions. Why, for instance, are some fats saturated, and what are they saturated with? Fatty acids are chains of carbon atoms bonded together in different ways, with hydrogen atoms attached, plus some oxygen atoms at one end. In a saturated fatty acid (SFA), the carbon atoms are all joined by single bonds, which means that there is nowhere for extra hydrogen atoms to attach themselves.</p> <p>The molecule is therefore \"satu rated\" with hydrogen atoms. Unsaturated fats, on the other hand, have a different structure - one that allows more hydrogen to become attached. In monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), one bond in the carbon chain is a double bond, but in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) there are two or more such double bonds. Surprisingly, this subtle difference has dietary significance.</p> <p>Another basic fact, frequently glossed over, is that the oils and fats we eat and cook with are actually cocktails of all three types of fatty acid - saturated, monounsatrated and polyunsaturated - in varying proportions (beef dripping, for instance, contains almost as much monounsaturated fat as saturated, and there's saturated fat in olive oil, but less of it).</p> <p>With the exception of tropical oils such as palm and coconut, the more saturated fatty acids a fat contains, the more likely it is to solidify when cool (an oil, by the way, is simply a fat in a liquid state). And here's a rather silly fact for your next dinner party. If fish didn't have more unsaturated than saturated fats about their persons, they would seize up in the cold sea, as their saturated fat content congealed. But let's get back to basics.</p> <p>What is fat for? Animals use it as a source of energy, as do plants (which is why so much oil is found in seeds). A single gram of fat produces nine calories, making it more than twice as valuable an energy source as protein or carbohydrates (starch and sugar). But fat is not just for burning. Every cell in our bodies is surrounded by a membrane that has fat as part of its structure (the human brain is, in fact, more than half \"structural\" fat), and layers of fat also cushion internal organs and insulate our bodies against cold. Fat carries a number of important substances around our system in solution, including vitamins A, D, E and K, and helps the body absorb them.</p> <p>One class of polyunsaturated fatty acids is called essential fatty acids (EFAs), because our bodies can't function without them (a lot are used to build neurons in our brains). Nor can we synthesise them internally, so EFAs must be obtained ready-made through our food. Some of the essential fatty acids we eat are converted into chemical messengers, which play a part in a variety of processes involving everything from blood pressure and inflammation to the immune system and the perception of pain. EFAs divide into two groups, called omega-6 and omega-3 (again, the numbering is to do with the precise layout of those carbon atom double bonds), and their different properties are at the heart of much current debate.</p> <p>Finding out positive things about fat is surprisingly easy these days, since organisations such as the British Heart Foundation and the British Dietetic Association seem anxious that we don't run away with the idea that all fat is bad and not a gram of it should enter our bodies. The Department of Health reckons that women need to consume a minimum of 30g of fat each day and men 40g in order to stay healthy (too little can cause infertility and bone weakness).</p> <p>But if we get more than 35% of our total calories from fat (around 70g per day for women, 95g for men), things start to go wrong. The most visible problem is obesity, when our bodies lay down any surplus as \"depot\" fat, straining our systems as well as our wardrobes. In general, western diets - and, if recent reports of obesity among Hong Kong children addicted to fast food are anything to go by, many eastern ones, too - contain more fat than we are likely to burn off by fingering buttons on the TV remote control.</p> <p>Consequently, while two-thirds of our species is dying from malnutrition, the other third is plagued with obesity and obsessed with reducing its body weight. But obesity is just an outward sign that something else is going on inside us. And we all know what that something is. For when it comes to getting information on the downside of fat, the lines are always open.</p> <p>Chief villains, all but a handful of lard salesmen and celebrity diet gurus now agree, are the saturated fats, which turn up in meat and dairy products, as well as in those deceptive tropical oils. Men, we are told, should have no more than 30g of saturates a day, and women, including actresses and fashion models, no more than 20g.</p> <p>Regimes such as the Zone Diet, followed by the likes of Jennifer Aniston, are said to switch off the insulin-driven fat storage mechanism by excluding carbohydrates. This alarms nutritionists, who argue that we are designed to obtain half our energy from carbohydrates. Cutting out an entire category of food has to be misguided, they say - particularly if the aim is to become skinnier than the next person and the next person is themselves so skinny that their next starring role is likely to be at their own funeral.</p> <p>But most critics of the celebrity diet are concerned because it replaces carbohydrates as a source of energy with food that is rich in saturated fat. For one thing, they say, SFAs cause the blood to become sticky and to form clots; for another, they cause the liver and other organs to make a waxy substance called cholesterol.</p> <p>Once it becomes oxidised, cholesterol can build up into a layer of plaque on the walls of blood vessels, constricting the flow and causing heart attacks and strokes, as well as scarring the vessels themselves. As a primary component of the membrane that surrounds each cell in the body, and as the starting material from which we make bile acids, steroid hormones and vitamin D, cholesterol, too, is essential to life. But the higher the level of it in our blood, the more readily it builds up on the vessel walls. And not only does saturated fat cause our livers to synthesise more cholesterol, but we also take it on board directly when we eat egg yolks, prawns, brains and other animal organs.</p> <p>Cholesterol, being fatty in nature, doesn't actually dissolve in the blood (nothing is that simple in this game). Instead, it gets around by attaching itself to clumps of protein called lipoproteins. Low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) carry cholesterol from the liver and drop it off with the cells that need it. High-density lipoproteins (HDLs) are now thought to take excess cholesterol back to the liver to be broken down, which is why cholesterol attached to HDLs is often referred to as \"good\" cholesterol.</p> <p>Some researchers believe that monounsaturated fatty acids - olive oil contains 80% and rapeseed oil 70% - reduce levels of LDLs and raise levels of HDLs when eaten in moderation (olive oil also contains a substance called squalene, which is thought to enhance this effect). Others, however, insist that they have no effect one way or the other. When it comes to the effects on cholesterol levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids - corn, cottonseed, fish, flaxseed, peanut, safflower, sunflower, soybean and walnut oils all contain high proportions of these - the picture is similarly confusing, with different claims made for different PUFAs. But on one thing, most authorities seem to agree: any unsaturate - mono or poly - is better than any saturate.</p> <p>Everybody has said for years that SFAs were trouble. Which is why the late 50s marked the beginning of what must be the biggest shift in general eating habits ever to have taken place outside of wartime - the move from animal to vegetable fats. Such a shift was possible - a conspiracy theorist might say convenient, even - because modern industrial methods such as heat treatment and the use of chemical solvents meant that it was now possible to isolate large quantities of cheap oil from many of the seeds and grains previously discarded by the textile and animal-feed industries.</p> <p>However, vegetable oil has one serious, practical disadvantage. It is liquid at room temperature. Therefore, in its natural form, it can neither be spread on bread nor used as a shortening in baking. Enter margarine (the word comes from the Greek word for pearl, as does the name Margaret). This stuff was invented by the French chemist Hippolyte M\u00e8ge-Mouri\u00e8s, who in 1869 won a prize offered by Napoleon III for a satisfactory butter substitute. It entails a process called hydrogenation, in which unsaturated fats are bombarded with hydrogen to make them more saturated and therefore firmer and longer-lasting. Trouble is, of course, you end up with a whole lot more saturated fatty acids, as well as some new molecules. These are called trans fatty acids (TFAs).</p> <p>Meat and dairy products contain tiny amounts of naturally-occurring TFAs. But for a really big dose, tuck into fast food, pastries, biscuits, cakes, crisps - anything, in fact, that has \"hydrogenated vegetable oil\" on the label (anything, you might almost say, that comes out of a packet). The harder the margarine, the more trans fat it contains. And, according to most sources, TFAs work in much the same way as saturated fats. In other words, they also raise cholesterol levels and cause heart disease.</p> <p>But did the massive shift away from animal fats bring with it deeper problems than those of hydrogenation? Artemis Simopoulos believes that it did. Central to the Aphrodite Diet is one of those arguments that seems so simple you wonder why you never heard it before. In terms of our genetic nuts and bolts, says Simopoulos (the back cover of the Aphrodite Diet points out that she was nutritional adviser to the Office of Consumer Affairs at the White House), humans have changed hardly at all since the Stone Age. For millions of years before that, our bodies developed in such a way as to make best use of the food available, and so slow is the process of evolution that we still need that particular blend of fuel in order to function properly.</p> <p>Today, we in the west think of dairy and cereal products as age-old cornerstones of a natural, wholesome diet. But humans took up animal husbandry only a few thousand years ago - which may explain why our bodies seem unable to cope with large quantities of dairy products. The same goes for the development of wild grasses into cereal crops worth the bother of harvesting. According to Simopoulos, microscopic analysis of fossilised food and bones from paleolithic times shows that, instead of dairy and cereal foods, those old hunter-gatherers ate fruit and green vegetables - three times as much as we do - as well as considerably more fish. And their meat was from game that had itself fed on wild plants.</p> <p>We might have grasped the important message about saturated fat, says Simopoulos, but in the rush to convert to vegetable oils we have overlooked the balance of essential fatty acids that our stone-age bodies were conditioned to expect. For while omega-6 fatty acids are abundant in oils such as corn, safflower, cottonseed and sunflower, omega-3 fatty acids are found primarily in seafood, green leafy vegetables, fatty fish, rapeseed oil, walnuts and flax. Recent research, Simopoulos says, suggests that our bodies function best when our diet contains a 4:1 ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids. \"Yet the typical western diet contains approximately 14 to 20 times more omega-6 fatty acids than omega-3s. This imbalance is now being linked with a long list of serious conditions and diseases.\"</p> <p>Her Aphrodite Diet, incidentally - a \"comprehensive three-week menu to get you started\" with \"fifty delicious and easy-to-make recipes\" - is based on the local Cretan version of the traditional Mediterranean diet. As luck would have it, the food eaten for 4,000 years by sturdy Cretan shepherds (as opposed to the stuff their grandchildren serve us tourists in the harbourside cafes at Chania) had much in common nutritionally with the diet of prehistoric hunter-gatherers. Rich in the olive oil and fish consumed all over the Mediterranean region, but with additional large helpings of greens and wild plants, the Cretan diet had come out on top in a landmark study of seven world diets conducted back in the 60s.</p> <p>The fact that Simopoulos is herself of Greek origin is one of those happy coincidences that crop up from time to time in every field of human endeavour.</p> <p>\"The Afro-what diet?\"</p> <p>\"Aphrodite.\"</p> <p>I was almost embarrassed to mention it. Where was it published? In a book. A book? That's right. A book with a picture of a woman in a white bikini on the cover.</p> <p>\"Pffffa!\"</p> <p>The occasional snort of derision was clearly audible. Did too much omega-6 fat promote tumour growth? If it did, then it was news to any of the researchers I spoke to. Yet other aspects of the Aphrodite argument were clearly present in mainstream thinking on this side of the Atlantic. Of omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids, Lyndel Costain, of the British Dietetic Association, said, \"The balance between these two classes of EFAs is important for their optimal function. As we usually get plenty of omega-6 fatty acids in our diet, we are encouraged to limit these and eat more omega-3s.\"</p> <p>And to begin with, Dr Sheila Bingham, of the Dunn Human Nutrition Laboratory at Cambridge, seemed determined to stick to the same line. Clearly anxious that yet another journalist wanted to unpick all the good health education work of the past two decades for the sake of a dubious story, Bingham insisted, \"The prime message is to cut down on saturated fats, because that is what brings down cholesterol, which is the risk factor in heart disease.\" In fact, she would go further than that. \"In general, we need to eat less fat overall. And all of this has to be taken in the context of the general message, which is that we should be eating more fruit and vegetables and whole-grain cereals and things like that, because all the epidemiology shows that people who eat more vegetables have less heart disease.\"</p> <p>What about omega-3 fatty acids? (I suddenly felt like a sly schoolboy who knew very well what the rules were but was trying to catch the teacher out, anyway). \"The current recommendation is to eat two portions of fatty fish per week - mackerel, sardines, salmon, etc.\" And for omega-6? \"The recommendation is that those levels should not increase at the moment. They are quite high.\"</p> <p>Aha!</p> <p>I didn't actually shout \"Aha\" down the phone, of course. But I was doing it again - turning the whole thing into a silly game - reverting to my former frame of mind in which I supposed that people such as Sheila Bingham take delight in making mealtimes a drab experience, unrelieved even by a dash of rapeseed oil (so conditioned are our palaeolithic bodies to seeking out rich fuel that even now, when fat is all around us and we don't need that much energy anyway, we still find it more appetising than anything else on the menu).</p> <p>By the time I spoke to Dr Jane Armitage at the Clinical Trial Services Unit in Oxford, I had a firmer grip on my attitude. Which was just as well, since she had clearly had her fill of journalists chasing scare stories and missing the main point.</p> <p>Armitage's work involves looking at the best research in the field and drawing conclusions from it. \"Measuring people's food intake is fraught with difficulty,\" she told me, \"so you need big numbers to make any sense of it. Big numbers mean big studies, and big studies are expensive. So there's no way a lot of it is going to get done.\"</p> <p>And the research is difficult in more fundamental ways, too. \"You can relate diet to intermediate things like cholesterol, and you can relate the cholesterol to heart disease. But it's extremely difficult to relate the diet to the heart disease. So you have to accept that there will be intermediate markers, but you have also to know that the intermediate markers are not of itself what's interesting. And so you've got to make the second link.\"</p> <p>It turns out that my original question about triglyceride levels - still not answered to everybody's satisfaction - is a good example of this sort of conundrum. \"It's been difficult to disentangle,\" said Armitage, \"because when triglycerides are raised, the HDL, or good cholesterol, tends to go down. We know low HDL is bad, but because the two things always go together we can't tell whether high triglycerides is bad just because it lowers HDL, or whether it's bad in its own right. And journalists have done a big disservice by highlighting this sort of confusion.</p> <p>\"In the past, people didn't want to believe the cholesterol-lowering story. A lot of journalists highlighted the concerns, which were probably unfounded, about suicide and accidents and depression all being linked to low cholesterol, and that whole thing was blown out of proportion. But over the past five to 10 years, a series of very powerful cholesterol-lowering drugs have become available and a series of very good quality trials using those drugs have actually demon- strated in some groups that cholesterol lowering is both worthwhile and saves lives.\"</p> <p>Worthwhile. Saves lives. The words were still ringing in my ears two days later when I dropped by to pick up my dreaded test results. Of course. The daughters of dairy farmers don't spend their lives taking blood samples and giving out dietary advice in crowded doctors' surgeries because they want to become exceedingly wealthy. They do it because it's sort of worthwhile. Because it might save a few lives. Me and the doctors, the dieticians and the nutritionists - we were on the same side, really. And each of us had just one aim in mind - to keep my heart pumping for a few more years. From now on, I would stop looking for excuses not to play my part in this thoroughly worthwhile project. Instead, I would make friends with the greengrocer, become a scourge of fatty fish everywhere and cut out my big breakfasts forthwith.</p> <p>And nor would I err on the side of obsessiveness, since this was not going to be a competition after all. Her alarming talk about omega-6 fats notwithstanding, Simopoulos seemed a paragon of moderation. It would be a shame to throw the baby out with the sunflower oil, so I resolved to borrow some tips from Aphrodite - among them the almost certainly risk-free advice to switch to rapeseed oil as my \"primary fat\", and a recipe for a tasty half-saturated butter substitute that spreads straight from the fridge (just blend softened butter 50:50 with rapeseed oil, then refrigerate - it really isn't bad!).</p> <p>So eager was I to get started on my sensible new regime that I didn't hear the receptionist the first time she said it. Normal, you say? The results are normal? But what about the triglycerides? Are you quite sure they aren't a little on the high side? No?</p> <p>Oh well. Perhaps I would embark on my new diet, anyway. Perhaps</p>",

      "bodyText": "A lesser GP would have bluffed. He'd have mumbled about red meat and long-chain molecules, drawn a whimsical analogy with the internal combustion engine, then referred me to a \"jolly good lipids man\". A cholesterol test had indicated that my blood contained an alarmingly high level of triglycerides, and a second test had confirmed the finding. Was that death's winged chariot I could hear at my back? Were too many triglycerides bad for the heart? \"I don't think anybody really knows,\" said my candid GP. \"Let's see what the book says.\" And, with a spin of his chair, he took an overweight volume from the shelf behind him and began turning the pages. \"Trichotillomania, tricuspid stenosis, trigeminal neuralgia... Here we are: triglyceride.\" This all happened several years ago, and I don't remember what the book said - only that it was vague and non-committal. My GP, it seemed, was not alone in his uncertainty. One thing he did know, of course: I needed to see a specialist. But I wasn't so sure. A specialist, I reasoned, might err too much on the side of caution. \"Frankly, old chap,\" he would say with a smile, \"there's a lot of work still to be done on this one. But to be on the safe side, you should draw up a list of everything you enjoy eating, then avoid it like the plague.\" A life of rumination would be my fate. A typical day on the safe side would be taken up with the steady munching of vegetables. An evening out would be pizza and side salad, minus the pizza and without any salad dressing. And to wash down this green cud? Mineral water. I'm not normally one to ignore professional advice, but the doctors weren't sure, for heaven's sake. I was due to move out of the area in a month, anyway. A new address, a change of GP... the Fats Police would never catch up with me. Did I want to spend my life living on the safe side? But no one can live in hiding forever. You might evade the medical profession, but there's no escaping the voice of reason in your own head. As the years went by, those dreadful test results haunted me. What if there was something seriously wrong? Perhaps they could fix it. Perhaps they could give me tablets. Perhaps they understood these things a little better now. Perhaps I should turn myself in. The nurse who extracted the blood said, with a little laugh, that she was the daughter of a dairy farmer. And as I studied the sheet of dietary advice she handed me to focus my mind in the week or so before the results came through, I could see why she found the thought amusing. There was my favourite Stilton in the \"avoid eating\" list. Camembert and brie made it into the \"once a week or less\" column, along with \"grilled back bacon (pre-boiled in water)\". Yummy! Even semi-skimmed milk was labelled \"Eat in moderation 2-3 times a week only\". How I would love to be a fly on the Yorkshire pudding when her family assembled for dinner. At first glance, her chart told me little that anybody who ever turned on a television or glanced at a magazine doesn't know by heart. Fruit and vegetables were the best source of nourishment, Bailey's cream liqueur the worst (when will they invent Bailey's Lite?). Fish was the food of the gods and taramasalata (fish eggs) the devil's work, while tofu and pork luncheonmeat glared at each other from opposite ends of the page. Occasionally, I would spot something that made my heart sink even deeper - crab meat was in the same category as oven chips, for instance, and both were lumped in with the liver that I had been brought up to consider the healthiest of foods. But this time I was going to bite the bullet (having first checked its fat content, of course). By giving free rein to my obsessive tendencies, I would show them the true meaning of lean cuisine. I'd be a model pupil - the ultimate convert. If the dieticians and nutritionists advised me to chew through two balls of string a day, then I'd be first in line when the hardware shop opened. And then I spotted the sunflower oil - \"Eat in moderation, once a week or less,\" it said. That couldn't be right, could it? After all, switching to sunflower oil, \"high in polyunsaturates\", had been my one major concession to nutritional correctness during the long years in hiding. Yet there it was in pink and blue, on a chart issued \"as a service to medicine\" by the drug company Pfizer and \"produced in association with the British Hypertension Society\". Corn oil, soya oil, safflower oil, grapeseed oil, peanut oil, sunflower oil, once a week or less. The condemnation of something previously recommended unnerved me. Why, even eggs were allowed to appear at table three times a week. What about all those Flora commercials? Had I missed something? It occurred to me that I might not, after all, be committing myself into the hands of sane people. In 1938, the British Medical Association had urged the nation to consume more dairy products, more eggs and more meat, and my own childhood diet, supplemented by lashings of free school milk (full-cream), had clearly been based on precisely that advice. One rule change in a lifetime may be regarded as a misfortune; two looks like carelessness. Not for the first time, I recalled the film Sleeper, and the scene in which Woody Allen wakes up in the future to be told that bran is now known to be harmful and that biscuits, chocolate and cream cakes are actually the healthiest foods. And never mind the future. Were there not dissenting voices even in the present - people who argued that fatty food no more caused heart attacks than smoking caused lung cancer? Our fate was predetermined by our genetic make-up, said some. Tense, fidgety types would burn up surplus fat whatever they ate, said others. And how about this? Half of Hollywood and the bulk of the fashion industry (now there's an oxymoron) was apparently living on something called the Zone Diet, a high-protein regime that demanded the consumption of burgers, steaks, butter, bacon, cheese, milk and cream, and actually banned boring bread and prissy pasta - anything, in fact, that was rich in carbohydrate. Carbs, they said, were the new fat. Perhaps these were the people I should be listening to. As the nurse's syringe sucked at my arm, her little chart of dietary advice worked at my brain and drained from it every drop of my new-found resolve. So nothing had changed since the last time I sat in this chair. They were still running around in the dark. But if they thought they were taking me with them, they were mistaken. They could count triglycerides until they were blue in the face. But when the letter came referring me to the specialist - when the surgery phoned, begging me to come in for an urgent chat - I'd be at lunch. Or breakfast. Or dinner. Waiter! I think I'm ready to order. Acouple of days later, I was still sounding off noisily to anyone within earshot when a friend, desperate to shut me up, handed me a book called The Aphrodite Diet (Vermilion, \u00a36.99). \"The cover's dreadful,\" she said, \"but you might find what's inside useful. It explains lots of stuff about fats.\" A tanned blonde in a white bikini stared out into the Aegean, wondering, no doubt, where her spare tyre had disappeared to. But beyond the cover were pie charts and bar graphs and any number of words like \"arachidonic\" and \"fibrinogen\". So I agreed to give the so-called experts one last chance. I secretly hoped that this would provide a convincing justification for that succulent meat-and-cream regime I'd been itching to share with Jennifer Aniston and Minnie Driver. But while the authors, Dr Artemis P Simopoulos and Jo Robinson, did have a cunning eating plan to sell - and one which argued that some types of fat, far from being the death of us, were actually an important item on the menu - it had more in common with the nurse's diet sheet than with titles such as A New Diet Revolution or Get Skinny On Fabulous Foods. One thing immediately caught my attention, however. This pair, it seemed, also wanted me to kick the sunflower oil habit. In fact, failure to cut down my intake of corn, soya, safflower, grapeseed, peanut and sunflower oils, and at the same time to increase my intake of rapeseed, flaxseed, walnut and fish oils might, they said, put me at risk of contracting a whole raft of ailments ranging from sundry inflammations and auto-immune diseases to heart attacks, stroke, depression and cancer. Cancer? What was going on here? Why was this not headline news? I read the book, then began to dig deeper, dipping into learned and not-so-learned journals, and talking to a variety of researchers. And it wasn't long before I made an important discovery about the subject of dietary fats - namely, that the processes involved are so subtle and complex that anyone can appear to prove anything simply by selecting their evidence with care. And given that, in matters of nutrition, much of the available evidence derives from studies funded by one or another rival branch of the food industry, that makes a quick tour of the subject akin to a drunken stroll through a hall of mirrors. At the very least, one ought to go armed with the some basic facts. So here are some to be going on with. The substance we call a fat is actually made up of compounds called fatty acids, attached to a backbone of glycerol (three parts fatty acid to one part glycerol equals my old friend the triglyceride - the chief form of fat obtained from plant and animal foods and stored in the body). For anyone, such as myself, whose knowledge of chemistry extends little further than a grasp of simple molecules with self-explanatory formulae such as H2O (two hydrogen atoms to every oxygen atom), this is tricky territory. The formula for linoleic acid, for example, is CH3 (CH CHCH) 3 (CH2) 7COOH. Most oils and fats contain at least a dozen of these fatty acids, and butter contains more than 100, each with different properties. But while no layperson should linger long on this level, a brief visit to the world of molecules does clear up one or two nagging questions. Why, for instance, are some fats saturated, and what are they saturated with? Fatty acids are chains of carbon atoms bonded together in different ways, with hydrogen atoms attached, plus some oxygen atoms at one end. In a saturated fatty acid (SFA), the carbon atoms are all joined by single bonds, which means that there is nowhere for extra hydrogen atoms to attach themselves. The molecule is therefore \"satu rated\" with hydrogen atoms. Unsaturated fats, on the other hand, have a different structure - one that allows more hydrogen to become attached. In monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), one bond in the carbon chain is a double bond, but in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) there are two or more such double bonds. Surprisingly, this subtle difference has dietary significance. Another basic fact, frequently glossed over, is that the oils and fats we eat and cook with are actually cocktails of all three types of fatty acid - saturated, monounsatrated and polyunsaturated - in varying proportions (beef dripping, for instance, contains almost as much monounsaturated fat as saturated, and there's saturated fat in olive oil, but less of it). With the exception of tropical oils such as palm and coconut, the more saturated fatty acids a fat contains, the more likely it is to solidify when cool (an oil, by the way, is simply a fat in a liquid state). And here's a rather silly fact for your next dinner party. If fish didn't have more unsaturated than saturated fats about their persons, they would seize up in the cold sea, as their saturated fat content congealed. But let's get back to basics. What is fat for? Animals use it as a source of energy, as do plants (which is why so much oil is found in seeds). A single gram of fat produces nine calories, making it more than twice as valuable an energy source as protein or carbohydrates (starch and sugar). But fat is not just for burning. Every cell in our bodies is surrounded by a membrane that has fat as part of its structure (the human brain is, in fact, more than half \"structural\" fat), and layers of fat also cushion internal organs and insulate our bodies against cold. Fat carries a number of important substances around our system in solution, including vitamins A, D, E and K, and helps the body absorb them. One class of polyunsaturated fatty acids is called essential fatty acids (EFAs), because our bodies can't function without them (a lot are used to build neurons in our brains). Nor can we synthesise them internally, so EFAs must be obtained ready-made through our food. Some of the essential fatty acids we eat are converted into chemical messengers, which play a part in a variety of processes involving everything from blood pressure and inflammation to the immune system and the perception of pain. EFAs divide into two groups, called omega-6 and omega-3 (again, the numbering is to do with the precise layout of those carbon atom double bonds), and their different properties are at the heart of much current debate. Finding out positive things about fat is surprisingly easy these days, since organisations such as the British Heart Foundation and the British Dietetic Association seem anxious that we don't run away with the idea that all fat is bad and not a gram of it should enter our bodies. The Department of Health reckons that women need to consume a minimum of 30g of fat each day and men 40g in order to stay healthy (too little can cause infertility and bone weakness). But if we get more than 35% of our total calories from fat (around 70g per day for women, 95g for men), things start to go wrong. The most visible problem is obesity, when our bodies lay down any surplus as \"depot\" fat, straining our systems as well as our wardrobes. In general, western diets - and, if recent reports of obesity among Hong Kong children addicted to fast food are anything to go by, many eastern ones, too - contain more fat than we are likely to burn off by fingering buttons on the TV remote control. Consequently, while two-thirds of our species is dying from malnutrition, the other third is plagued with obesity and obsessed with reducing its body weight. But obesity is just an outward sign that something else is going on inside us. And we all know what that something is. For when it comes to getting information on the downside of fat, the lines are always open. Chief villains, all but a handful of lard salesmen and celebrity diet gurus now agree, are the saturated fats, which turn up in meat and dairy products, as well as in those deceptive tropical oils. Men, we are told, should have no more than 30g of saturates a day, and women, including actresses and fashion models, no more than 20g. Regimes such as the Zone Diet, followed by the likes of Jennifer Aniston, are said to switch off the insulin-driven fat storage mechanism by excluding carbohydrates. This alarms nutritionists, who argue that we are designed to obtain half our energy from carbohydrates. Cutting out an entire category of food has to be misguided, they say - particularly if the aim is to become skinnier than the next person and the next person is themselves so skinny that their next starring role is likely to be at their own funeral. But most critics of the celebrity diet are concerned because it replaces carbohydrates as a source of energy with food that is rich in saturated fat. For one thing, they say, SFAs cause the blood to become sticky and to form clots; for another, they cause the liver and other organs to make a waxy substance called cholesterol. Once it becomes oxidised, cholesterol can build up into a layer of plaque on the walls of blood vessels, constricting the flow and causing heart attacks and strokes, as well as scarring the vessels themselves. As a primary component of the membrane that surrounds each cell in the body, and as the starting material from which we make bile acids, steroid hormones and vitamin D, cholesterol, too, is essential to life. But the higher the level of it in our blood, the more readily it builds up on the vessel walls. And not only does saturated fat cause our livers to synthesise more cholesterol, but we also take it on board directly when we eat egg yolks, prawns, brains and other animal organs. Cholesterol, being fatty in nature, doesn't actually dissolve in the blood (nothing is that simple in this game). Instead, it gets around by attaching itself to clumps of protein called lipoproteins. Low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) carry cholesterol from the liver and drop it off with the cells that need it. High-density lipoproteins (HDLs) are now thought to take excess cholesterol back to the liver to be broken down, which is why cholesterol attached to HDLs is often referred to as \"good\" cholesterol. Some researchers believe that monounsaturated fatty acids - olive oil contains 80% and rapeseed oil 70% - reduce levels of LDLs and raise levels of HDLs when eaten in moderation (olive oil also contains a substance called squalene, which is thought to enhance this effect). Others, however, insist that they have no effect one way or the other. When it comes to the effects on cholesterol levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids - corn, cottonseed, fish, flaxseed, peanut, safflower, sunflower, soybean and walnut oils all contain high proportions of these - the picture is similarly confusing, with different claims made for different PUFAs. But on one thing, most authorities seem to agree: any unsaturate - mono or poly - is better than any saturate. Everybody has said for years that SFAs were trouble. Which is why the late 50s marked the beginning of what must be the biggest shift in general eating habits ever to have taken place outside of wartime - the move from animal to vegetable fats. Such a shift was possible - a conspiracy theorist might say convenient, even - because modern industrial methods such as heat treatment and the use of chemical solvents meant that it was now possible to isolate large quantities of cheap oil from many of the seeds and grains previously discarded by the textile and animal-feed industries. However, vegetable oil has one serious, practical disadvantage. It is liquid at room temperature. Therefore, in its natural form, it can neither be spread on bread nor used as a shortening in baking. Enter margarine (the word comes from the Greek word for pearl, as does the name Margaret). This stuff was invented by the French chemist Hippolyte M\u00e8ge-Mouri\u00e8s, who in 1869 won a prize offered by Napoleon III for a satisfactory butter substitute. It entails a process called hydrogenation, in which unsaturated fats are bombarded with hydrogen to make them more saturated and therefore firmer and longer-lasting. Trouble is, of course, you end up with a whole lot more saturated fatty acids, as well as some new molecules. These are called trans fatty acids (TFAs). Meat and dairy products contain tiny amounts of naturally-occurring TFAs. But for a really big dose, tuck into fast food, pastries, biscuits, cakes, crisps - anything, in fact, that has \"hydrogenated vegetable oil\" on the label (anything, you might almost say, that comes out of a packet). The harder the margarine, the more trans fat it contains. And, according to most sources, TFAs work in much the same way as saturated fats. In other words, they also raise cholesterol levels and cause heart disease. But did the massive shift away from animal fats bring with it deeper problems than those of hydrogenation? Artemis Simopoulos believes that it did. Central to the Aphrodite Diet is one of those arguments that seems so simple you wonder why you never heard it before. In terms of our genetic nuts and bolts, says Simopoulos (the back cover of the Aphrodite Diet points out that she was nutritional adviser to the Office of Consumer Affairs at the White House), humans have changed hardly at all since the Stone Age. For millions of years before that, our bodies developed in such a way as to make best use of the food available, and so slow is the process of evolution that we still need that particular blend of fuel in order to function properly. Today, we in the west think of dairy and cereal products as age-old cornerstones of a natural, wholesome diet. But humans took up animal husbandry only a few thousand years ago - which may explain why our bodies seem unable to cope with large quantities of dairy products. The same goes for the development of wild grasses into cereal crops worth the bother of harvesting. According to Simopoulos, microscopic analysis of fossilised food and bones from paleolithic times shows that, instead of dairy and cereal foods, those old hunter-gatherers ate fruit and green vegetables - three times as much as we do - as well as considerably more fish. And their meat was from game that had itself fed on wild plants. We might have grasped the important message about saturated fat, says Simopoulos, but in the rush to convert to vegetable oils we have overlooked the balance of essential fatty acids that our stone-age bodies were conditioned to expect. For while omega-6 fatty acids are abundant in oils such as corn, safflower, cottonseed and sunflower, omega-3 fatty acids are found primarily in seafood, green leafy vegetables, fatty fish, rapeseed oil, walnuts and flax. Recent research, Simopoulos says, suggests that our bodies function best when our diet contains a 4:1 ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids. \"Yet the typical western diet contains approximately 14 to 20 times more omega-6 fatty acids than omega-3s. This imbalance is now being linked with a long list of serious conditions and diseases.\" Her Aphrodite Diet, incidentally - a \"comprehensive three-week menu to get you started\" with \"fifty delicious and easy-to-make recipes\" - is based on the local Cretan version of the traditional Mediterranean diet. As luck would have it, the food eaten for 4,000 years by sturdy Cretan shepherds (as opposed to the stuff their grandchildren serve us tourists in the harbourside cafes at Chania) had much in common nutritionally with the diet of prehistoric hunter-gatherers. Rich in the olive oil and fish consumed all over the Mediterranean region, but with additional large helpings of greens and wild plants, the Cretan diet had come out on top in a landmark study of seven world diets conducted back in the 60s. The fact that Simopoulos is herself of Greek origin is one of those happy coincidences that crop up from time to time in every field of human endeavour. \"The Afro-what diet?\" \"Aphrodite.\" I was almost embarrassed to mention it. Where was it published? In a book. A book? That's right. A book with a picture of a woman in a white bikini on the cover. \"Pffffa!\" The occasional snort of derision was clearly audible. Did too much omega-6 fat promote tumour growth? If it did, then it was news to any of the researchers I spoke to. Yet other aspects of the Aphrodite argument were clearly present in mainstream thinking on this side of the Atlantic. Of omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids, Lyndel Costain, of the British Dietetic Association, said, \"The balance between these two classes of EFAs is important for their optimal function. As we usually get plenty of omega-6 fatty acids in our diet, we are encouraged to limit these and eat more omega-3s.\" And to begin with, Dr Sheila Bingham, of the Dunn Human Nutrition Laboratory at Cambridge, seemed determined to stick to the same line. Clearly anxious that yet another journalist wanted to unpick all the good health education work of the past two decades for the sake of a dubious story, Bingham insisted, \"The prime message is to cut down on saturated fats, because that is what brings down cholesterol, which is the risk factor in heart disease.\" In fact, she would go further than that. \"In general, we need to eat less fat overall. And all of this has to be taken in the context of the general message, which is that we should be eating more fruit and vegetables and whole-grain cereals and things like that, because all the epidemiology shows that people who eat more vegetables have less heart disease.\" What about omega-3 fatty acids? (I suddenly felt like a sly schoolboy who knew very well what the rules were but was trying to catch the teacher out, anyway). \"The current recommendation is to eat two portions of fatty fish per week - mackerel, sardines, salmon, etc.\" And for omega-6? \"The recommendation is that those levels should not increase at the moment. They are quite high.\" Aha! I didn't actually shout \"Aha\" down the phone, of course. But I was doing it again - turning the whole thing into a silly game - reverting to my former frame of mind in which I supposed that people such as Sheila Bingham take delight in making mealtimes a drab experience, unrelieved even by a dash of rapeseed oil (so conditioned are our palaeolithic bodies to seeking out rich fuel that even now, when fat is all around us and we don't need that much energy anyway, we still find it more appetising than anything else on the menu). By the time I spoke to Dr Jane Armitage at the Clinical Trial Services Unit in Oxford, I had a firmer grip on my attitude. Which was just as well, since she had clearly had her fill of journalists chasing scare stories and missing the main point. Armitage's work involves looking at the best research in the field and drawing conclusions from it. \"Measuring people's food intake is fraught with difficulty,\" she told me, \"so you need big numbers to make any sense of it. Big numbers mean big studies, and big studies are expensive. So there's no way a lot of it is going to get done.\" And the research is difficult in more fundamental ways, too. \"You can relate diet to intermediate things like cholesterol, and you can relate the cholesterol to heart disease. But it's extremely difficult to relate the diet to the heart disease. So you have to accept that there will be intermediate markers, but you have also to know that the intermediate markers are not of itself what's interesting. And so you've got to make the second link.\" It turns out that my original question about triglyceride levels - still not answered to everybody's satisfaction - is a good example of this sort of conundrum. \"It's been difficult to disentangle,\" said Armitage, \"because when triglycerides are raised, the HDL, or good cholesterol, tends to go down. We know low HDL is bad, but because the two things always go together we can't tell whether high triglycerides is bad just because it lowers HDL, or whether it's bad in its own right. And journalists have done a big disservice by highlighting this sort of confusion. \"In the past, people didn't want to believe the cholesterol-lowering story. A lot of journalists highlighted the concerns, which were probably unfounded, about suicide and accidents and depression all being linked to low cholesterol, and that whole thing was blown out of proportion. But over the past five to 10 years, a series of very powerful cholesterol-lowering drugs have become available and a series of very good quality trials using those drugs have actually demon- strated in some groups that cholesterol lowering is both worthwhile and saves lives.\" Worthwhile. Saves lives. The words were still ringing in my ears two days later when I dropped by to pick up my dreaded test results. Of course. The daughters of dairy farmers don't spend their lives taking blood samples and giving out dietary advice in crowded doctors' surgeries because they want to become exceedingly wealthy. They do it because it's sort of worthwhile. Because it might save a few lives. Me and the doctors, the dieticians and the nutritionists - we were on the same side, really. And each of us had just one aim in mind - to keep my heart pumping for a few more years. From now on, I would stop looking for excuses not to play my part in this thoroughly worthwhile project. Instead, I would make friends with the greengrocer, become a scourge of fatty fish everywhere and cut out my big breakfasts forthwith. And nor would I err on the side of obsessiveness, since this was not going to be a competition after all. Her alarming talk about omega-6 fats notwithstanding, Simopoulos seemed a paragon of moderation. It would be a shame to throw the baby out with the sunflower oil, so I resolved to borrow some tips from Aphrodite - among them the almost certainly risk-free advice to switch to rapeseed oil as my \"primary fat\", and a recipe for a tasty half-saturated butter substitute that spreads straight from the fridge (just blend softened butter 50:50 with rapeseed oil, then refrigerate - it really isn't bad!). So eager was I to get started on my sensible new regime that I didn't hear the receptionist the first time she said it. Normal, you say? The results are normal? But what about the triglycerides? Are you quite sure they aren't a little on the high side? No? Oh well. Perhaps I would embark on my new diet, anyway. Perhaps",

Nearly three quarters of the delegates to the party conventions will be chosen between February 1 and March 7, the primary \"Super Tuesday\", when the two largest states, California and New York, are among 11 voting that day. This frontloading of the primary season was designed to help candidates backed by the party establishments - Al Gore for the Democrats and George W Bush for the Republicans - since only they could accumulate the funding to organise so early and on such a wide scale. The old days when an outsider could win an early primary and then build momentum and funding for a serious challenge have gone. The rescheduling has created a \"pre-campaign\" in which presidential hopefuls were knocked out not by a lack of votes, but by a lack of cash. Candidates including Elizabeth Dole and Dan Quayle abandoned the Republican race last autumn, overwhelmed by Mr Bush's financial juggernaut. Among the Democrats, Mr Gore's early lock on the nomination meant that potential challengers like Dick Gephardt and Bob Kerrey decided it was not even worth bothering.",

      "bodyText": "The number of people killed in scuba diving accidents in UK waters has more than doubled in three years, according to official figures released yesterday which raise fresh fears that the soaring popularity of adventure sports is endangering lives. The maritime and coastguard agency revealed there were 18 fatalities last year - compared with 15 in 1998 and seven in 1997 - the overwhelming majority of which were blamed on a lack of training. In one incident, said the agency's report, a diver suffered a burst lung when he surfaced too quickly, while another lost buoyancy and sank to her death in 55 metres of water. Six people died after suffering suspected heart attacks while diving, another diver became separated from her support boat and drowned on the surface in rough seas, and a novice was hit on the head by a boat's propeller and died instantly. Reg Hill, the agency's diving officer, blamed most incidents on \"rapid ascents and missed decompression stops\". \"It is clear that divers are failing to maintain correct buoyancy control, and have failed to keep their weightbelts attached at crucial moments,\" he said. \"It is also evident that some of the incidents are caused by divers panicking, especially novices. \"The primary reason for lack of buoyancy control appears to be training, or the lack of it.\" In common with other pursuits once regarded as extreme, such as white water rafting, skydiving, snowboarding and canyoning, scuba diving has enjoyed a huge burst in popularity in the past 10 years, driven to a large extent by the wide availability of cheap diving excursions on package holidays overseas. The agency estimates that up to 1.5m dives take place in UK waters annually. While most of these are in coastal waters, one diver died at Coniston Water in the Lake District. The figures are likely to in crease calls for the statutory enforcement of minimum training standards. In the UK, the three main training organisations are British Sub Aqua Clubs, the Sub Aqua Association and the Professional Association of Diving Instructors (PADI), each of which designs its own instruction programmes. Eric Albinsson, quality assurance manager at the UK branch of PADI, the world's largest dive training organisation, said the sport had grown so much because, as well as becoming more accessible, the equipment was better and the training, \"which used to be very militaristic\", was now geared towards the recreational diver. \"Of course we strive to reduce incidents to a minimum, ideally zero, but as with any activity, the more people you have the more difficult that becomes.\" There was some positive news for the sport in the agency's report. The number of non-fatal incidents last year was down on the previous two years, with 105 people requiring medical assistance after dives. This was mainly for decompression sickness.",

Newton's guiding principle was what goes up must come down - and that is exactly what has been happening to the once booming British music industry. Even Oasis, Britpop's most stellar and boorish offsprings, are beginning to feel the effects of gravity.</p> <p>If reaction to their new single, Go Let It Out, is anything to go by the omens are not good for their first album in two years. The record chains HMV and Our Price have ordered far fewer copies of the single than their last underwhelming effort, All Around the World.</p> <p>Not even the Gallaghers' own label, Big Brother Records, seems all that hopeful. It has only made 250,000 copies of the new album - half the number the teen idol Britney Spears' last single, Crazy, sold.</p> <p>Go Let It Out may be getting blanket radio airplay, and Oasis can still sell out Wembley in two hours, but industry insiders detect a desperation behind the hype - even if no one takes too seriously Noel Gallagher's boast that Britain's biggest band only made Standing on the Shoulder of Giants \"cos we're skint\".</p> <p>With the band so often written off as retread Beatles, there may be more than mere self-parody behind Gallagher's decision to go on Radio One next week and cover the Who's My Generation rather than play one of his own new songs.</p> <p>But the problems are not confined to Oasis, whom the veteran pop pundit Jonathan King dismissed as going the way of all \"old, fat, lazy bands trying to be hungry, poor and enthusiastic\". As if to prove the point, Gallagher popped up yesterday to say that \"when you've four houses or nine cars\" it no longer really matters how well your group does.</p> <p><b> Europop</b><br></p> <p>The snap and crackle has gone out of pop too, with sales slipping and international revenues deep in doldrums. Even the Spice Girls have lost their ginger.</p> <p>Only two British artists have made any impact in America this year, the fortysomething DJ Fatboy Slim and the 13-year-old Welsh soprano Charlotte Church. It's a long way from the heady days of the mid-90s when Oasis, Blur, the Verve and Radiohead were taking on the world.</p> <p>British rock and pop has not done much better at home where Europop, so long the butt of our jokes, dominated last year. Only two acts made the domestic top 10 singles of 1999 - the worst performance in years - and one of those was Cliff Richard's Millennium Prayer, a song so risible that Mel C of the Spice Girls felt moved to publicly condemn it as a \"steaming pile of shit\".</p> <p>Market share for both albums and singles is down 10% on last year, after similarly disappointing showings in 1998 - a not inconsiderable blow to the whole economy given that the music business long ago surpassed the steel industry with export earnings in excess of \u00a31.2bn a year. UK sales account for a further \u00a31.9m.</p> <p>To make matters worse, Creation, the record label that was once the epitome of Britpop cool, appears to be in freefall after its founder and svengali Alan McGee departed for cyberspace.</p> <p>If it were not for the relative success of such unadulteratedly commercial teeny poppers such as Steps, S Club 7 and Lolly, and the rash of Irish boy bands, things would be very grim indeed.</p> <p>Even the British Phonographic Industry, which lobbies for the sector, admits: \"No one can claim that we are doing as well as we were.\" Certainly as executives pack their bags this weekend for the annual industry jolly, Midem, in Cannes, they have a lot to ponder.</p> <p>Chris Smith, the culture secretary, will tell them on Monday that they are still the pick of the government's cherished \"creative industries\", but the chances of Downing Street throwing open its doors again as it did to Oasis in 1997 look pretty slim.</p> <p>Chris Green, of the BPI, is adamant that there is no crisis and maintained that the poor figures were a blip.</p> <p>He said: \"These things tend to be cyclical. I don't think there are any signs of anything fundamentally wrong in the industry. Britpop was a phenomenon. We had bands who were right up there internationally and that obviously had a tremendous effect. No doubt others will come along and we will be right up there again.\"</p> <p>He argued that British acts were doing better in some genres and claimed that big worldwide hits by Irish bands such as the Corrs were distorting the figures. \"Many of these bands are actually signed to UK labels.\" Although we were \"not doing great\" in the US, Mr Green added, British bands still accounted for one-third of all platinum discs last year in Europe. \"There a lot of albums from big British bands due this week, so there is a lot to look forward to.\"</p> <p>Steve Jones, of Music Week magazine, the industry bible, said the relative success of the teen bands and pop acts such as Robbie Williams had masked the decline, but that trend was beginning to wane. \"Still, there's a lot of new exciting bands around right now, and even more established bands like All Saints are winning back fans with their song from the new film The Beach.\"</p> <p>He said new albums due this year from A-list bands that include the Prodigy, Radiohead, the Spice Girls and the former Verve frontman Richard Ashcroft would probably reverse the losses. \"There is a lot of energy out there. I think we are going to see more girl pop acts coming through. We shouldn't write ourselves off just yet.\"</p> <p>Johnny Hopkins, the former Oasis publicist once known as \"the fifth member of the band\", who parted company with the Gallaghers earlier this week, said it was true that British rock had \"got a bit staid and grey and going nowhere.</p> <p>But he said: \"You have to remember that before 1994, people would not touch British bands,\" he said. \"It was all Nirvana and that sort of stuff. Then Oasis and Blur and Pulp came along. It all goes in cycles. There is a lot of good pop around here at the moment but the more interesting creative bands like Primal Scream and Death In Vegas are now making the dents.\"</p> <p><b>Head here for the charts</b></p> <p><b> Top 10 singles 1999</b><br></p> <p><b> 1</b> <b> Baby One More Time</b> Britney Spears - American</p> <p><b> 2</b> <b> Blue (Da Ba Dee)</b> Eiffel 65 - Dutch</p> <p><b> 3</b> <b> Millennium Prayer</b> Cliff Richard - British</p> <p><b> 4</b> <b>Mambo No 5 (A Little Bit Of)</b> Lou Bega - German</p> <p><b> 5</b> <b> 9pm (Till I Come)</b> ATB - German</p> <p><b> 6</b> <b> Livin' La Vida Loca</b> Ricky Martin - Puerto Rican</p> <p><b> 7</b> <b> That Don't Impress Me Much </b> Shania Twain - American</p> <p><b> 8</b> <b> Sweet Like Chocolate</b> Shanks &amp; Bigfoot - British</p> <p><b> 9</b> <b> Flat Beat</b> Mr Oizo - French</p> <p><b> 10</b> <b> When The Going Gets Tough </b> Boyzone - Irish</p> <p><b> Top 10 singles 1997 </b><br></p> <p><b> 1 Something About_/ Candle In The Wind</b> Elton John - British</p> <p><b> 2 Barbie Girl </b> Aqua - Danish/Norwegian</p> <p><b> 3</b> <b> I'll Be Missing You</b> Puff Daddy &amp; Faith Evans - American</p> <p><b> 4 Perfect Day</b> Various Artists - British</p> <p><b> 5 Teletubbies Say Eh-Oh! </b> Teletubbies - British</p> <p><b> 6 Men In Black </b> Will Smith - American</p> <p><b> 7 Don't Speak </b> No Doubt - American</p> <p><b> 8 Torn</b> Natalie Imbruglia - Australian</p> <p><b> 9 Spice Up Your Life</b> Spice Girls - British</p> <p><b> 10 Tubthumping</b> Chumbawamba - British</p> <p><b> Top 10 singles 1995</b><br></p> <p><b> 1 Unchained Melody/White Cliffs</b> Robson &amp; Jerome - British</p> <p><b> 2 Gangsta's Paradise</b> Coolio featuring LV - American</p> <p><b> 3 I Believe/Up on the Roof</b> Robson &amp; Jerome - British</p> <p><b> 4 Back for Good</b> Take That - British</p> <p><b> 5 Think Twice</b> Celine Dion - Canadian</p> <p><b> 6 Earth Song</b> Michael Jackson - American</p> <p><b> 7 Fairground</b> Simply Red - British</p> <p><b> 8 Missing</b> Everything But The Girl - British</p> <p><b> 9 You Are Not Alone</b> Michael Jackson - American</p> <p><b>10 Wonderwall</b> Oasis - British</p> <p>Source: Chart Information Network</p>",

It has only made 250,000 copies of the new album - half the number the teen idol Britney Spears' last single, Crazy, sold. Go Let It Out may be getting blanket radio airplay, and Oasis can still sell out Wembley in two hours, but industry insiders detect a desperation behind the hype - even if no one takes too seriously Noel Gallagher's boast that Britain's biggest band only made Standing on the Shoulder of Giants \"cos we're skint\". With the band so often written off as retread Beatles, there may be more than mere self-parody behind Gallagher's decision to go on Radio One next week and cover the Who's My Generation rather than play one of his own new songs. But the problems are not confined to Oasis, whom the veteran pop pundit Jonathan King dismissed as going the way of all \"old, fat, lazy bands trying to be hungry, poor and enthusiastic\". As if to prove the point, Gallagher popped up yesterday to say that \"when you've four houses or nine cars\" it no longer really matters how well your group does. Europop The snap and crackle has gone out of pop too, with sales slipping and international revenues deep in doldrums. Even the Spice Girls have lost their ginger. Only two British artists have made any impact in America this year, the fortysomething DJ Fatboy Slim and the 13-year-old Welsh soprano Charlotte Church. It's a long way from the heady days of the mid-90s when Oasis, Blur, the Verve and Radiohead were taking on the world. British rock and pop has not done much better at home where Europop, so long the butt of our jokes, dominated last year. Only two acts made the domestic top 10 singles of 1999 - the worst performance in years - and one of those was Cliff Richard's Millennium Prayer, a song so risible that Mel C of the Spice Girls felt moved to publicly condemn it as a \"steaming pile of shit\". Market share for both albums and singles is down 10% on last year, after similarly disappointing showings in 1998 - a not inconsiderable blow to the whole economy given that the music business long ago surpassed the steel industry with export earnings in excess of \u00a31.2bn a year. UK sales account for a further \u00a31.9m. To make matters worse, Creation, the record label that was once the epitome of Britpop cool, appears to be in freefall after its founder and svengali Alan McGee departed for cyberspace. If it were not for the relative success of such unadulteratedly commercial teeny poppers such as Steps, S Club 7 and Lolly, and the rash of Irish boy bands, things would be very grim indeed. Even the British Phonographic Industry, which lobbies for the sector, admits: \"No one can claim that we are doing as well as we were.\" Certainly as executives pack their bags this weekend for the annual industry jolly, Midem, in Cannes, they have a lot to ponder. Chris Smith, the culture secretary, will tell them on Monday that they are still the pick of the government's cherished \"creative industries\", but the chances of Downing Street throwing open its doors again as it did to Oasis in 1997 look pretty slim. Chris Green, of the BPI, is adamant that there is no crisis and maintained that the poor figures were a blip. He said: \"These things tend to be cyclical. I don't think there are any signs of anything fundamentally wrong in the industry. Britpop was a phenomenon. We had bands who were right up there internationally and that obviously had a tremendous effect. No doubt others will come along and we will be right up there again.\" He argued that British acts were doing better in some genres and claimed that big worldwide hits by Irish bands such as the Corrs were distorting the figures. \"Many of these bands are actually signed to UK labels.\" Although we were \"not doing great\" in the US, Mr Green added, British bands still accounted for one-third of all platinum discs last year in Europe. \"There a lot of albums from big British bands due this week, so there is a lot to look forward to.\" Steve Jones, of Music Week magazine, the industry bible, said the relative success of the teen bands and pop acts such as Robbie Williams had masked the decline, but that trend was beginning to wane. \"Still, there's a lot of new exciting bands around right now, and even more established bands like All Saints are winning back fans with their song from the new film The Beach.\" He said new albums due this year from A-list bands that include the Prodigy, Radiohead, the Spice Girls and the former Verve frontman Richard Ashcroft would probably reverse the losses. \"There is a lot of energy out there. I think we are going to see more girl pop acts coming through. We shouldn't write ourselves off just yet.\" Johnny Hopkins, the former Oasis publicist once known as \"the fifth member of the band\", who parted company with the Gallaghers earlier this week, said it was true that British rock had \"got a bit staid and grey and going nowhere. But he said: \"You have to remember that before 1994, people would not touch British bands,\" he said. \"It was all Nirvana and that sort of stuff. Then Oasis and Blur and Pulp came along. It all goes in cycles. There is a lot of good pop around here at the moment but the more interesting creative bands like Primal Scream and Death In Vegas are now making the dents.\" Head here for the charts Top 10 singles 1999 1 Baby One More Time Britney Spears - American 2 Blue (Da Ba Dee) Eiffel 65 - Dutch 3 Millennium Prayer Cliff Richard - British 4 Mambo No 5 (A Little Bit Of) Lou Bega - German 5 9pm (Till I Come) ATB - German 6 Livin' La Vida Loca Ricky Martin - Puerto Rican 7 That Don't Impress Me Much Shania Twain - American 8 Sweet Like Chocolate Shanks &amp; Bigfoot - British 9 Flat Beat Mr Oizo - French 10 When The Going Gets Tough Boyzone - Irish Top 10 singles 1997 1 Something About_/ Candle In The Wind Elton John - British 2 Barbie Girl Aqua - Danish/Norwegian 3 I'll Be Missing You Puff Daddy &amp; Faith Evans - American 4 Perfect Day Various Artists - British 5 Teletubbies Say Eh-Oh!

It seemed to goad him into slapping down the all-party coalition that wrecked Jack Straw's \u00a3100m plan to curb the right to jury trial on Thursday night as an offence to liberty. The run-up to Labour's 1,000th day in office this Wednesday has been rough. Mr Blair's aggressive speech came after a week in which he has faced anger over NHS spending, rising crime, heckling for his criticism of Ken Livingstone, divisions over the government's ethical foreign policy and rows about General Pinochet's departure and Mike Tyson's arrival. Last night William Hague, the Tory leader, taunted Mr Blair with being a \"cheque is in the post\" prime minister. \"Once again he is all talk but no delivery. He is always making promises, but he hasn't actually delivered on the promises he made in the first place,\" he said. The Liberal Democrat leader, Charles Kennedy, said the shine was finally coming off the government, with \"more normal politics\" being restored. In yesterday's speech, Mr Blair again set out his third way: a knowledge-driven economy based on full employment, mutual respect and an end to poverty. \"Economic competence and social justice, fairness and enterprise\" went hand in hand, in contrast to the old Labour indifference to wealth creation and the Thatcherite disdain for compassion, he suggested once again. With Mr Hague trailing 47%-30% in this week's Guardian/ICM poll, Blairites deny that their hero is bitter. But his anger was evident when he complained: \"The more radical our reforms, the more they are resisted, but in the long run the better [are] the rewards.\" From devolution to the welfare-to-work programme, which had helped cut unemployment by 700,000 since 1997, Mr Blair was adamant that his critics were being proved wrong. Some schools, hospitals and police forces performed much better than others - proof that more needs to be done, he said. \"I believe we have a way of reforming public services that again breaks with the past. \"It rejects the old left view that money was the basic answer to all problems, that few difficult decisions about structure or methods or new practices need to be taken if only the money is available,\" he said.",

      "body": "<p>As we pull away from the coastline, the island monastery of Valaam rises from the steely waters of Lake Lagoda like an apparition. Only a single, gleaming dome is visible at first through the haze, a gilded beacon guiding the ferry towards its destination. Soon, it is possible to make out the pillbox-like chapel beneath, perched on the crest of an outlying island and moored to the archipelago by a wooden walkway. The stocky ramparts of the monastery building rear up behind. Finally, as we turn into the ice-logged main waterway, we are confronted by the soaring, cobalt spire and cupolas of the Cathedral of the Transfiguration, the focal point of this fortress of orthodoxy. </p> <p>The effect of this vision on the handful of monks returning to spend winter in the monastery, might seem, to the unaccustomed observer, a little startling. Throughout most of our journey, they have seemed sullen, quietly praying or staring impassively into the distance. Suddenly, the cabin is flapping with black habits and flowing beards. Some are setting their watches to \"monastery time\", Valaam's own private time zone, in synch, not with Russia, but with Jerusalem and the Holy Land. Others form a line along one frozen, wind-swept deck, their heads nodding, their cupped fingers frantically working through the co-ordinates of the sign of the cross. After we had disembarked, one young novice explained the need for such observance: \"The beauty of this place, it moves you to prayer.\" It is now 10 years since the monks began returning to this outpost on the Karelian peninsula, a 10-hour train and ferry ride north of St Petersburg. </p> <p>It's been a decade of extraordinary transformation and renewal for the orthodox church in Russia, one that has seen it cast off the shackles of soviet suppression to achieve a degree of independence unknown throughout its 1,000 year history. Since 1990, 13,000 parishes have been re-established and 460 monasteries reopened, about 20,000 clergy given official posts and 22 new seminaries established; 50% of Russia's population now declares itself to be orthodox, the largest congregation of any eastern Christian church. </p> <p>This burgeoning sense of self-confidence has coincided with the rise, within church ranks, of a growing tendency towards anti-liberalism and an alarming level of aggressive chauvinism towards other religions. The last 10 years have also seen the church form an uncomfortably close relationship with the largely unreformed state that once suppressed it, regularly supporting the Russian government (the Patriarch's endorsement of the war in Chechnya) and wielding in return considerable political influence. The most sinister consequence has been a controversial new law, pushed through the Russian parliament in 1997, mostly as a result of orthodox support, which human rights groups claim has triggered a \"secret offensive\" by the state services against \"non-traditional\" religions in Russia, with tactics from bureaucratic obstruction to alleged beatings. </p> <p>Euphemistically titled \"On freedom of conscience and religious associations\", the law recognises the \"special role of orthodoxy in the history of Russia\". It also gives elevated status to the Russian federation's estimated 10m Muslims, Jews and mainstream Buddhists, despite uneasy attitudes to these faiths, illustrated by the current onslaught in Chechnya and by endemic anti-Semitism. The legis lation required religious organisations to meet stringent conditions, many designed to exclude minority faiths, in order to re-register with the state before December 31 1999. The passing of that millennial deadline has deprived about half of Russia's religious bodies of legal status, theoretically casting them back into the unofficial \"underground\" of the soviet era. They have lost the right to worship in public, own property, have bank accounts and engage in missionary or charitable work. The \"war on God\" may have ended, but just a decade after the humiliating defeat of the world's first avowedly atheist state, a new religious cold war in Russia may only be beginning. </p> <p> Nowhere could seem further from these inter-church battlefields than Valaam, accessible when temperatures plunge only by helicopter or a treacherous jeep-ride across the ice. For the 100 or so monks living here, this is the most extreme form of retreat from the grimy contradictions and the disappointments of \"worldly\" Russian life, a place to surrender themselves to prayer, chastity, poverty and to the ascetic ideal of obriad , ritualised living. </p> <p>Rising at 5.30am, they spend as much as 10 hours a day in the incense-laden darkness of the cathedral, sparkling in their gold-embroidered robes and filling the air with plainchant or the cadences of church Slavonic. The contrast between the stringency of the ritual and the splendour of the sacred vessels suggests a contradictory God of sumptuousness and austerity. Often the monks don't emerge from the cathedral until after midnight, to be greeted by the northern lights flickering in the sky. </p> <p>The monks of Valaam could be regarded as the future of the orthodox church. A large proportion seem young, in their twenties or early thirties, and their drooping beards and pitchy robes are ill-fitting. Many have come to Valaam via extraordinary paths. Brother Daniil was a DJ, well known on the Moscow club scene. Brother Icidor was an actor who found God through a stage adaptation of Dostoyevsky's novel, The Possessed. The Valaam iconographer, who now presides over a cupboard full of verdigris, ochre and cobalt, and books of delicate gold leaf, was once a socialist realist painter whose commissions included Lenin and Brezhnev; an unbeliever who discovered religion through a paperback bought in the Moscow metro. </p> <p>All the monks smoulder with a conviction of spiritual superiority, what they refer to as the truth of orthodoxy: \"If Russia does not become an orthodox nation, then there is no hope for its survival,\" says Brother Alexander, 23. \"At a time when there are so many unChristian ideals, this is the only thing that can bring us together.\" On the historical persecution of orthodox believers by other faiths, Brother Kukshe, 27, a monk with burning eyes and an almost messianic intensity, is even more forthright: \"Throughout the whole history of Russia, we have seen from the Catholics only blood,\" he exclaims. \"We can't count the amount of orthodox they have killed, particularly in Serbia.\" </p> <p>While Archimandrite Pankraty, the affable Abbot of Valaam, is eager to temper the more outspoken assertions of his monks, he tends to agree with them in principle and is in tune with the sentiment behind the new law on religion: \"Just take a country like Greece, a member of the European Union and ostensibly a civilised country. The orthodox religion is its state religion and the state helps it because it understands that the stronger the church, the stronger the society. The same is true of Israel, where Judaism is state-sponsored, despite lots of Christians and Muslims. Nobody finds that strange. Russia, too, has its own particular history and religious tradition and needs to preserve it.\" </p> <p>In principle, the monks' position is irrefutable. Since the conversion of the Slavs in the 10th century, shortly before the great schism when eastern and western branches of the Christian church split , the orthodox faith has had a definitive role in the life of the Russian nation.After the fall of Constantinople in 1453, the idea that Moscow would take its place and become the \"third Rome\" gave the nation its sense of purpose. </p> <p>About the same time, missionary monks, including crusaders from Valaam who penetrated as far as Alaska, helped conquer Siberia. Beliefs were so entrenched that when Peter the Great, in a secularisation drive, ordered the nobles to cut off their beards [a symbol of orthodox belief] they hid the cut-off hair in their pockets, for fear they might not be admitted clean-shaven to heaven. Right up to the 1917 revolution, the sense of statehood was so indistinct that, if asked about nationality, a Russian peasant was likely to answer: \"I am orthodox and from here.\" </p> <p>While the communist era anti-religious onslaught is estimated to have produced 170,000 Christian martyrs and led to widespread desecration of church property (Valaam was first a sanatorium for disabled soldiers and later a repository for exiled dissidents), it is estimated that 50m Russians still clung to their religion. Ironically, what the quasi-religious conception of Russian identity, and the orthodox faith, have proved least well-equipped to survive is the pluralism of modern liberalisation. The church was most alarmed by the groups flooding into the country after the collapse of the Soviet Union, many (including Mormons, Jehovah's Witnesses, Seventh Day Adventists and Scientology) with assertive missionary policies. </p> <p>Even today, a trip to the red-brick Hubbard Humanitarian Centre in north Moscow, with its psychic personality tests, or a visit to the Pentecostal temple in the southern suburb of Tsaritsyno, give an indication of how exotic these religions must have seemed 10 years ago. In starkest contrast to the solemn majesty of Valaam, the Pentecostals worship in a sweaty, low-ceilinged cubicle, most of which is taken up by the band in front and a giant mixing desk at the back. Familiar cries of \"Hall-le-luu-jah!\" and \"Jesus is among us\" are given an added incongruity by the tinkly Russian pop backing, while the noises issuing from the glassy-eyed old babushkas in a session of speaking in tongues have an eerie bluntness I've never observed before. \"This faith allows us to express ourselves. And since the actual services are conducted in Russian, we can understand what is going on,\" said one young woman, explaining why the Pentecostals rank second to orthodoxy in many regions, including Karelia, the region of the Valaam monastery. </p> <p>The perceived threat of these religious groups was compounded by the simultaneous influx of sects such as the Unification church of Reverend Moon and the Aum Shinrikyo doomsday cult, which, at the time of the Tokyo subway attack in 1995 was estimated to have around 50,000 Russian followers, more than in Japan. </p> <p>The result was a backlash in the media, church and general population against most new and resurgent religious groups, many of which were now associated in the public consciousness with the rise of what were called \"totalitarian cults\". \"It became obvious that the legal situation at the time was quite unconnected to reality,\" says Father Vsevolod Chaplin, a representative of the inter-church relations department of the Patriarchate, who helped draft the new legislation. \"Any of these groups could set themselves up as a religious organisation with just 10 signatures. This new law gives the government the right to curtail the activities of destructive organisations. Most older religions have no reason to worry.\" </p> <p>In reality, the situation is not quite so clear. Many of the articles of the law, such as the requirement that religions must prove they have existed on Russian territory for 15 years, aim at all the faiths that have arrived since the fall of communism. Other articles are so vague that they can be used on any grounds against any religious group: \"From a purely legal point of view,\" says Vladimir Riakhovsky, director of the Christian legal centre, which guides churches through the registration process, \"This is an extremely badly-made law, riddled with contradictions and imprecision. That's why the bureaucrats can read it in exactly the way they want. One of the conditions for the liquidation of a church institution is the violation of social order. What does this term mean? Since the law offers no definition, it can mean anything.\" </p> <p> And that, in what appears to be tacit collusion between the state and repressive elements of the orthodox church, is exactly how the law is being interpreted and applied, as an excuse to suppress any group that threatens the ascendancy of traditional Russian faiths. So far, even the Catholic Jesuits and the Baptists have had applications to local authorities turned down, many on arbitrary technicalities. The Pentecostal church has been widely obstructed, and \"liquidated\" in the eastern city of Khazan by a court order. </p> <p>In the first court case brought under the the new law, Jehovah's Witnesses are now being threatened in Moscow for \"instigating religious enmity\" by doing no more than claiming to be the only true faith and \"causing family breakdown\" by demanding that believers make religious work their first priority. A favourite pariah, Scientology, has been regularly raided by the police; church members claim staff have been physically attacked. </p> <p>\"In Russia, the law and the legal system can be regarded only as a system of signals,\" says Yakov Krotov, a journalist and religious campaigner. \"What this new religion act has done is send out a signal that it is now right to persecute minority faiths.\" </p> <p>While none of this compares with the soviet anti-religious campaigns, it does reflect badly on the orthodox church, which appears to have transformed itself from persecuted victim to bullying aggressor in a decade. The most probable reasons for this transfiguration lie in the murk of the soviet era. \"The communist party built the church in its own image,\" says dissident orthodox priest Father Georgi Edelshtein, whose outspoken views mean he is ostracised by the Patriarchate. \"All the bishops were carefully picked so that they would work with the soviet government. All were KGB agents. It is well known that Patriarch Alexy was recruited by the KGB, under the code-name of Drozdov. Today, they are preserving the same politics that they had 20 or 30 years ago.\" </p> <p>In some cases, members of the council for religious affairs, the soviet body charged with controlling religion, have found alternative employment in the bureaucracy of the church, with one prominent ex-member Victor Kalinin, now legal advisor to the Patriarch and a major force behind the law. \"It's as if post-war Germany had employed an ex-Nazi to oversee ethnic relations,\" comments Larry Uzzell, chief of the Moscow bureau of the Keston institute, which runs a religious news service. </p> <p>This intimacy with government and power has brought the church dividends, such as state-sponsored reconstruction of the Church of Christ the Saviour in Moscow, which was dynamited by Stalin but now looms proudly over Moscow once again, at an estimated cost of $360m. It has also resulted in such damaging and highly publicised scandals as the involvement of the church in the importation of oil and cigarettes. </p> <p>But the drive to constrict the activities of minority religions is unlikely to have the desired result . The Russian state is now so debilitated by inefficiency and corruption that its capacity for oppression is extremely limited. \"What we have found is that implementation of the law fluctuates wildly from one province to another,\" says Larry Uzzell. \"The law is so vague and the state so unwieldy that it has not only created 'fortresses of oppression' but some 'islands of religious freedom', Kostroma, Yekaterinburg and St Petersburg.\" </p> <p>As the orthodox church should have learned from its history, harassment of religion will only tarnish its own reputation, while steeling the resistance of persecuted faiths. Some may even see their congregations boosted by the their newly-rediscovered unofficial status: \"I hope it doesn't come to it, but, if necessary, we will go underground,\" says Bishop Sergei Riakhovsky of the Pentecostal church. \"It's a place where we have already been, so it would not be too unfamiliar. But our government and the orthodox church will be the biggest losers.\" </p> <p>As the deadline for registration passed with the old millennium, the denomination with the largest number of unregistered churches and parishes was not the Jehovah's Witnesses or the Mormons, but orthodoxy, which had been hampered by sluggishness of its bureaucracy, its size in comparison to the other faiths and by an air of complacency. The failure of an attempt last December to have the deadline extended means that many orthodox organisations are now theoretically vulnerable to dissolution. </p> <p>\"In Moscow and St Petersburg they are unlikely to liquidate parishes,\" says Lev Levinson of the Duma committee on religion, \"but they might do so in Karachayevo-Cherkessiya or Tatarstan.\" (Regions where orthodoxy is not the majority faith.) </p> <p>Even the monastery of Valaam had still not managed, when I visited, to complete the process of registration. \"It is not something that we are too worried about,\" said Abbot Pankraty. \"It will all be worked out.\" Far more pressing were such immediate concerns as a fire that had just destroyed a wooden church, a storm that threatened to trap us on the island for weeks, and the strict regime of worship. </p> <p>The Abbot feels that any significant contribution that Valaam might make to the wider debate must be by spiritual example, by the ferocious conviction of the monks and their commitment to the virtues of piety, self denial and charity, virtues that may one day lead to a more forgiving and tolerant church in Russia. </p> <p>\"When we arrived here on the island everything was falling apart,\" the Abbot says. \"All the buildings were crumbling and everything was sooty and dirty. Somehow, with God's help, we started to work and step by step we got to where we are now. Perhaps, what is happening in the monasteries will help Russia in general, help it find its true path. But we cannot concern ourselves directly with the problem. All we can do is pray.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "As we pull away from the coastline, the island monastery of Valaam rises from the steely waters of Lake Lagoda like an apparition. Only a single, gleaming dome is visible at first through the haze, a gilded beacon guiding the ferry towards its destination. Soon, it is possible to make out the pillbox-like chapel beneath, perched on the crest of an outlying island and moored to the archipelago by a wooden walkway. The stocky ramparts of the monastery building rear up behind. Finally, as we turn into the ice-logged main waterway, we are confronted by the soaring, cobalt spire and cupolas of the Cathedral of the Transfiguration, the focal point of this fortress of orthodoxy. The effect of this vision on the handful of monks returning to spend winter in the monastery, might seem, to the unaccustomed observer, a little startling. Throughout most of our journey, they have seemed sullen, quietly praying or staring impassively into the distance. Suddenly, the cabin is flapping with black habits and flowing beards. Some are setting their watches to \"monastery time\", Valaam's own private time zone, in synch, not with Russia, but with Jerusalem and the Holy Land. Others form a line along one frozen, wind-swept deck, their heads nodding, their cupped fingers frantically working through the co-ordinates of the sign of the cross. After we had disembarked, one young novice explained the need for such observance: \"The beauty of this place, it moves you to prayer.\" It is now 10 years since the monks began returning to this outpost on the Karelian peninsula, a 10-hour train and ferry ride north of St Petersburg. It's been a decade of extraordinary transformation and renewal for the orthodox church in Russia, one that has seen it cast off the shackles of soviet suppression to achieve a degree of independence unknown throughout its 1,000 year history. Since 1990, 13,000 parishes have been re-established and 460 monasteries reopened, about 20,000 clergy given official posts and 22 new seminaries established; 50% of Russia's population now declares itself to be orthodox, the largest congregation of any eastern Christian church. This burgeoning sense of self-confidence has coincided with the rise, within church ranks, of a growing tendency towards anti-liberalism and an alarming level of aggressive chauvinism towards other religions. The last 10 years have also seen the church form an uncomfortably close relationship with the largely unreformed state that once suppressed it, regularly supporting the Russian government (the Patriarch's endorsement of the war in Chechnya) and wielding in return considerable political influence. The most sinister consequence has been a controversial new law, pushed through the Russian parliament in 1997, mostly as a result of orthodox support, which human rights groups claim has triggered a \"secret offensive\" by the state services against \"non-traditional\" religions in Russia, with tactics from bureaucratic obstruction to alleged beatings. Euphemistically titled \"On freedom of conscience and religious associations\", the law recognises the \"special role of orthodoxy in the history of Russia\". It also gives elevated status to the Russian federation's estimated 10m Muslims, Jews and mainstream Buddhists, despite uneasy attitudes to these faiths, illustrated by the current onslaught in Chechnya and by endemic anti-Semitism. The legis lation required religious organisations to meet stringent conditions, many designed to exclude minority faiths, in order to re-register with the state before December 31 1999. The passing of that millennial deadline has deprived about half of Russia's religious bodies of legal status, theoretically casting them back into the unofficial \"underground\" of the soviet era. They have lost the right to worship in public, own property, have bank accounts and engage in missionary or charitable work. The \"war on God\" may have ended, but just a decade after the humiliating defeat of the world's first avowedly atheist state, a new religious cold war in Russia may only be beginning. Nowhere could seem further from these inter-church battlefields than Valaam, accessible when temperatures plunge only by helicopter or a treacherous jeep-ride across the ice. For the 100 or so monks living here, this is the most extreme form of retreat from the grimy contradictions and the disappointments of \"worldly\" Russian life, a place to surrender themselves to prayer, chastity, poverty and to the ascetic ideal of obriad , ritualised living. Rising at 5.30am, they spend as much as 10 hours a day in the incense-laden darkness of the cathedral, sparkling in their gold-embroidered robes and filling the air with plainchant or the cadences of church Slavonic. The contrast between the stringency of the ritual and the splendour of the sacred vessels suggests a contradictory God of sumptuousness and austerity. Often the monks don't emerge from the cathedral until after midnight, to be greeted by the northern lights flickering in the sky. The monks of Valaam could be regarded as the future of the orthodox church. A large proportion seem young, in their twenties or early thirties, and their drooping beards and pitchy robes are ill-fitting. Many have come to Valaam via extraordinary paths. Brother Daniil was a DJ, well known on the Moscow club scene. Brother Icidor was an actor who found God through a stage adaptation of Dostoyevsky's novel, The Possessed. The Valaam iconographer, who now presides over a cupboard full of verdigris, ochre and cobalt, and books of delicate gold leaf, was once a socialist realist painter whose commissions included Lenin and Brezhnev; an unbeliever who discovered religion through a paperback bought in the Moscow metro.

      "body": "<p>There's something thrilling and unexpected about listening to Christabel Pankhurst, after her release from Holloway prison in 1908, passionately demanding the vote for women. Or hearing Charles Lightoller, second officer on the Titanic, remember watching the ship go down. Or hearing the excitement in the voice of Howard Carter from 1936 describing his discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun. </p> <p>Some of the key historical moments and figures of the 20th century were never captured by photographers, still less by moving images. But they survive in sound. The last century was the first to give us a complete soundtrack of its path and for historians of the future it will be the first moment amid centuries of documents when they can actually hear the raw emotion, the intonation, accent and stress of the authentic voice of history. </p> <p>What would they give for a recording of Henry VIII or an interview with a soldier at the Battle of Waterloo? If Thomas Edison hadn't invented recorded sound in 1877 - and by the way, almost anyone could have done, as it used no new scientific knowledge, technology, or materials - we would lack the ability we now have to eavesdrop on history. </p> <p>Yet when the British Library National Sound Archive came to compiling its own soundtrack of the 20th century for a new CD, A Century in Sound, we were amazed by what had never been recorded. </p> <p>Although gramophones were popular in Britain by the 1930s, the arbitrariness of what was recorded at the time and what has survived is astonishing. Some key figures and events are nowhere to be found amongst the archive's 1.1m discs and 185,000 tapes, one of the largest in the world. Where is the voice of Oscar Wilde or Thomas Hardy? Why has not one second survived of George Orwell when he broadcast so extensively? Why do we have recordings of James Joyce and even Queen Victoria, William Gladstone and Florence Nightingale, but not of King Edward VII? Why Lloyd George but not the founder of the Labour party, Keir Hardie; Antarctic explorer Shackleton, but not Captain Scott? </p> <p>In some cases we had recordings but they were disappointing. Virginia Woolf gives few clues as to her brilliance as an author, and no single recording of Bertrand Russell seems to do justice to his standing as one of the key thinkers and peace campaigners of the century. The same can be said of the recordings of trade union leader Ben Tillett, and Labour's first prime minister, Ramsay MacDonald, both of whose oratory was marvelled at by contemporaries but who utterly fail to impress now. </p> <p>No doubt some of these absences and disappointments are due to the recording technology of the day. Until the end of the first world war, live \"actuality\" recording (which we can now carry in our back pockets) was virtually impossible. Sound quality was appalling and recordings lasted only a few minutes. The BBC invariably stage-managed and scripted everything, and until the 1960s, a very large and intimidating amount of heavy equipment was required for even the simplest recording, which was rarely conducive to spontaneous self-expression. It was also an expensive and time-consuming process, favouring people of fame, influence and money, such as Churchill, Amy Johnson, Gandhi and King George V (who all appear on the CD), rather than ordinary people, whose voices are largely missing from the archive.

      "bodyText": "There's something thrilling and unexpected about listening to Christabel Pankhurst, after her release from Holloway prison in 1908, passionately demanding the vote for women. Or hearing Charles Lightoller, second officer on the Titanic, remember watching the ship go down. Or hearing the excitement in the voice of Howard Carter from 1936 describing his discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun. Some of the key historical moments and figures of the 20th century were never captured by photographers, still less by moving images. But they survive in sound. The last century was the first to give us a complete soundtrack of its path and for historians of the future it will be the first moment amid centuries of documents when they can actually hear the raw emotion, the intonation, accent and stress of the authentic voice of history. What would they give for a recording of Henry VIII or an interview with a soldier at the Battle of Waterloo? If Thomas Edison hadn't invented recorded sound in 1877 - and by the way, almost anyone could have done, as it used no new scientific knowledge, technology, or materials - we would lack the ability we now have to eavesdrop on history. Yet when the British Library National Sound Archive came to compiling its own soundtrack of the 20th century for a new CD, A Century in Sound, we were amazed by what had never been recorded. Although gramophones were popular in Britain by the 1930s, the arbitrariness of what was recorded at the time and what has survived is astonishing. Some key figures and events are nowhere to be found amongst the archive's 1.1m discs and 185,000 tapes, one of the largest in the world. Where is the voice of Oscar Wilde or Thomas Hardy? Why has not one second survived of George Orwell when he broadcast so extensively? Why do we have recordings of James Joyce and even Queen Victoria, William Gladstone and Florence Nightingale, but not of King Edward VII? Why Lloyd George but not the founder of the Labour party, Keir Hardie; Antarctic explorer Shackleton, but not Captain Scott? In some cases we had recordings but they were disappointing. Virginia Woolf gives few clues as to her brilliance as an author, and no single recording of Bertrand Russell seems to do justice to his standing as one of the key thinkers and peace campaigners of the century. The same can be said of the recordings of trade union leader Ben Tillett, and Labour's first prime minister, Ramsay MacDonald, both of whose oratory was marvelled at by contemporaries but who utterly fail to impress now. No doubt some of these absences and disappointments are due to the recording technology of the day. Until the end of the first world war, live \"actuality\" recording (which we can now carry in our back pockets) was virtually impossible. Sound quality was appalling and recordings lasted only a few minutes. The BBC invariably stage-managed and scripted everything, and until the 1960s, a very large and intimidating amount of heavy equipment was required for even the simplest recording, which was rarely conducive to spontaneous self-expression. It was also an expensive and time-consuming process, favouring people of fame, influence and money, such as Churchill, Amy Johnson, Gandhi and King George V (who all appear on the CD), rather than ordinary people, whose voices are largely missing from the archive. Hardly any contemporary recorded accounts survive of ordinary life for millions of Britons before the second world war. Fortunately for posterity, from the late 1950s oral historians such as George Ewart Evans, and an increasing number of broadcasters (led by Charles Parker's Radio Ballads and Stephen Peet's Yesterday's Witness on television) pioneered a movement to democratise not only the collection of the voices of ordinary people but also their preservation in archives.

In a sense, this is dangerous: pop-star-meets-psycho news stories suggest that a more enigmatic icon makes for a more tenacious stalker. But, as far as the well-balanced fan is concerned, it's possible that this situation is for the best: after all, nine out of 10 flesh-real musical heroes let you down.

Do we need them to shake their hips and say \"Hello Huddersfield, are you ready to rock?\" before the buzz starts, or is their silent, motionless presence enough on its own?

As we arrive, the ticket collector hands us a huge trophy and congratulates us on being the first British residents to visit Rock Circus. He doesn't really, but he might as well have done: after all, how many non-tourists do you know who spend their afternoons looking at waxworks? Most music biz people I spoke to about the place asked me if it was a new gig venue. </p> <p>First we meet Thriller-era Michael Jackson (grade: B-). I compliment him on his bum-fluff, but he stares right through me. Pete assures me that it's nothing personal: Michael's just shy. Upstairs, next to the model of Bryan Ferry (C+), there's a picture of the Roxy Music singer with what appears to be a hose in his ear and a skewer in his nostril, looking like he's about to twat the person on the other end of said implements. The unconvincing caption informs us that \"Bryan remained typically suave for his sitting\". </p> <p>Across the room, we find Cliff Richard (F-) in the little-known Miami Vice phase of his career, and an authentically out-of-it Brian Wilson (A-), staring vacantly up at the ceiling, obviously considering what sort of skirting board topping to spread over his beetroot souffl\u00e9. Further on, second-rate celebrities make do with getting model hands. Pete and I are delighted to discover that we have bigger hands than Meatloaf, taking this as confirmation that we could \"have\" him. Kiss's hands all have the distinguishing feature of being bigger than my feet. </p> <p>There's a gaping lack of emphasis placed on natural environment: most of the waxworks are impeccably attired but stand next to a stark wall. Would it have stretched the budget to put Brian Wilson in a sandpit, Bob Dylan on a motorbike, Jimi Hendrix in a dressing room entangled with six or seven groupie succubi, or Keith Richards serving on the pharmaceutical counter at Boots? Crude? Maybe. But Rock Circus's most vulgar section - the graveyard of the stars - is the place's most successful feature_ and the one that feels least funereal. </p> <p>I'm still trying to figure out why that buzz isn't coming through. Is it because, having met a few famous people, I'm inured to their presence? Or is it because the Mick Jagger model (F-) would make a more convincing Reginald Perrin? One slip - a wonky nose, a wandering chin - and the illusion is over. Pete Townshend (ungraded) looks more like former Blue Peter presenter Peter Duncan.

There's a gaping lack of emphasis placed on natural environment: most of the waxworks are impeccably attired but stand next to a stark wall. Would it have stretched the budget to put Brian Wilson in a sandpit, Bob Dylan on a motorbike, Jimi Hendrix in a dressing room entangled with six or seven groupie succubi, or Keith Richards serving on the pharmaceutical counter at Boots? Crude? Maybe. But Rock Circus's most vulgar section - the graveyard of the stars - is the place's most successful feature_ and the one that feels least funereal. I'm still trying to figure out why that buzz isn't coming through. Is it because, having met a few famous people, I'm inured to their presence? Or is it because the Mick Jagger model (F-) would make a more convincing Reginald Perrin? One slip - a wonky nose, a wandering chin - and the illusion is over. Pete Townshend (ungraded) looks more like former Blue Peter presenter Peter Duncan. And, no matter how much you use your imagination, Duncan leaping into the air, poised to make his Fender into matchwood, isn't the same as Townshend doing the same thing, is it?",

They confirm the conviction and sincerity of her singing, and her faultless sense of style. Alan Blyth Gr\u00e9 Brouwenstijn, soprano, born August 26 1915; died December 14 1999",

The abduction, which occurred under the noses of police and anti-sect protesters, came just days after Aum's leaders denounced their guru, Shoko Asahara, changed the cult's name and pledged to compensate its victims in a bid to avert a crackdown by the authorities. Police said that one of Mr Asahara's daughters was among six cult members who burst into an Aum compound in Asahimura, scuffled with residents and seized the guru's seven-year-old son, Akiteru. One of the intruders, Satoshi Nagayama, a former cult member, was arrested, but the others escaped by car. The motive for the abduction remain unclear, but speculation has centred on the possibility of a power struggle within the sect, whose willingness to resort to violence was shown by the 1995 sarin gas attack, which killed 12 people and injured thousands. Faced with an imminent crackdown by security authorities, senior cultists announced on Tuesday that they were no longer led by Mr Asahara, who is on trial for the gas attack and 16 other crimes. Fumihiro Joyu, the guru's former right hand man, criticised Mr Asahara for wrongly predicting Armageddon last year and acknowledged for the first time that the man who claims to be a reincarnation of Shiva, the god of destruction, was involved in the gas attack. Aum also announced that it would change its name to Aleph, the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet, recant its doomsday doctrines and sell its properties to compensate the victims of its crimes. This is likely to have enraged hardliners in the cult, which has always been divided between a violent political wing and disciples seeking only enlightenment.

AP, Buenos Aires Late dictator's funds seized Swiss banks have frozen \u00a3390m in accounts belonging to the late Nigerian dictator, General Sani Abacha, and his associates, and more money may be found, the federal office of police affairs said yesterday. That is more money than in any previous case where Switzerland has frozen funds of former dictators. The government is also believed to be taking steps to recover money from Britain, France, Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg and Liechtenstein. AP, Bern Survivor loses Auschwitz case Switzerland's highest court yesterday threw out a complaint by a Holocaust survivor who claimed that the Swiss government was responsible for handing him over to the Nazis - but then awarded him the money he had demanded anyway. The court decided that there was no legal basis for Joseph Spring's claim, more than 50 years after Swiss border guards handed the Jewish refugee over to the Germans, who then deported him to Auschwitz, because their actions did not violate refugee law at the time. But it agreed that Mr Spring, 73, should be given \u00a338,000 to cover his costs and on ethical grounds. AP, Lausanne, Switzerland",

      "bodyText": "A court in southern Vietnam has sentenced 14 people to prison terms ranging from 13 months to 20 years for involvement in the country's biggest illegal adoption ring, the state-owned news agency reported yesterday. Bui Van Khanh, a former official in the justice department in An Giang province, and Nguyen Kim Thanh, a local obstetrician, received the longest sentences of 20 years, the official agency said. They and the other defendants had been charged with assisting the illegal adoption of nearly 200 children to foreigners via an orphanage run by the An Giang Red Cross branch from 1995-97. Khanh had accepted a total of \u00a38,500 in bribes to legalise adoptions, while nurses received up to \u00a39 for every child they \"successfully collected\", the news agency said. In some cases, nurses would persuade pregnant women who were either unmarried, ill or getting divorced to give up their babies by saying the children would be brought up by relatives of medical workers. The case was postponed in May last year because of a lack of evidence. Adoptions of Vietnamese babies by foreigners have soared in recent years, with some couples trying to avoid red tape by using unauthorised agents, according to diplomats. Since the An Giang case was exposed, other adoption rings selling babies to foreigners have also been smashed. Western couples and their newly adopted babies are a common sight in Vietnam's foreign medical clinics, where doctors examine the health of the infants before the adoption process is complete. It is unclear how much couples are expected to pay to adopt a Vietnamese baby.",

      "body": "<p>Why did Bill Gates move job? The answer may have appeared this week in the guise of Transmeta's Crusoe chip. Billed as Silicon Valley's new, new thing, it hit Wall Street this week in a big big way. Cheaper, faster, more powerful than anything residing on your desk, Transmeta's offering knocked the stuffing out of microprocessor-makers Intel and ARM. </p> <p>But it may be the sucker punch to the plans of Microsoft's newly installed chief software architect to dominate the globe. For behind the new chip is the 29-year-old Finnish programmer Linus Torvalds, who, along with hundreds of other rocket scientists, cobbled together Linux, the world's fastest-growing operating system. </p> <p>Operating systems - such as Windows, the MacOS on Apple computers and Linux - provide the set of instructions that allow computers to process information. And at the moment, it is Linux that is the code of choice. Nasa swears by it. Hollywood's Titanic would not have been made without it. </p> <p>The word is that Linux is more reliable than Microsoft's Windows NT and cheaper than another rival, Unix. </p> <p>But most important, Microsoft's dominance - its Windows software is used on 85% of the world's computers - is predicated on the people using Intel-style chips. Under the current rules of the game, software designed for one processor will not run on another. For example, a word processor designed for a Macintosh computer will not run on an Intel-based PC. That may be history. Thanks to Torvalds' wizardry, Crusoe will transmute the instructions of other processors into a set the Transmeta chips can understand. </p> <p>The new alchemy is called \"code morphing\" and it threatens Microsoft's doctrine - and, like the US administration's anti-monopolies case, the Seattle company's cash flow. </p> <p>Torvalds, although he denies it, is making a habit of challenging Gates. Whereas Bill Gates has become the richest man in history by controlling the operating system in the home of nearly every computer user on the planet, Torvalds gave his out - over the net - for free. </p> <p>But what is surprising is not what divides them but how much unites them. Both were brattishly clever. Both have come to dominate computer systems around the world. Both have brown hair and wear glasses. </p> <p>The real question is who will get Gates first: the government or the geek. </p> <p><strong> Penny wise... </strong><br> </p> <p> Forget Mike Tyson against Julius Francis. The real bruisers are to be found elsewhere, slugging it out over British membership of the single currency. The latest round will get under way on Monday when global management consultancy AT Kearney unveils its latest foreign direct investment confidence index. </p> <p>The UK had a high ranking in the last of the six-monthly surveys of 155 of the world's biggest firms - it came fourth - and is tipped to have done better this time. </p> <p>This will be seized on immediately by euro-sceptics as evidence that Britain is not being damaged by being out of the single currency zone. Certainly the survey looks likely to present a sharply contrasting view from that expressed somewhat tentatively recently by the trade and industry secretary, Stephen Byers, and more directly by Toyota's honorary chairman, Shoichiro Toyoda. </p> <p>There is no doubt which corner the crowd is cheering for - euroscepticism is on the rise according to the latest opinion polls. There is, however, a danger that the arguments in favour of signing up to the single currency are being subsumed into a related but different argument over the level of the exchange rate. </p> <p>The pound is now at a 14-year high on a trade weighted basis and at a staggering DM3.20. Even Switzerland is starting to look cheap - OK, cheaper. </p> <p>True enough, manufacturing exporters are showing signs of being able to cope - though they can hardly welcome the prospect of further sterling appreciation now being touted in some City circles. </p> <p>Britain's farmers, who have had the double whammy of a rising pound and a fall in agricultural prices, face a further extension of the sector's five-year long recession. </p> <p>But though there will be many in the pro-euro camp who see membership as a solution to the squeeze exerted by the pound's current exchange rate, that is scarcely a sufficient reason in itself for British membership, nor a guaranteed solution for the immediate problem. </p> <p>Some investors may be deterred from investing in Britain because of a perky pound but if the euro's supporters are to mount an effective case they need to broaden the argument.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Why did Bill Gates move job? The answer may have appeared this week in the guise of Transmeta's Crusoe chip. Billed as Silicon Valley's new, new thing, it hit Wall Street this week in a big big way. Cheaper, faster, more powerful than anything residing on your desk, Transmeta's offering knocked the stuffing out of microprocessor-makers Intel and ARM. But it may be the sucker punch to the plans of Microsoft's newly installed chief software architect to dominate the globe. For behind the new chip is the 29-year-old Finnish programmer Linus Torvalds, who, along with hundreds of other rocket scientists, cobbled together Linux, the world's fastest-growing operating system. Operating systems - such as Windows, the MacOS on Apple computers and Linux - provide the set of instructions that allow computers to process information. And at the moment, it is Linux that is the code of choice. Nasa swears by it. Hollywood's Titanic would not have been made without it. The word is that Linux is more reliable than Microsoft's Windows NT and cheaper than another rival, Unix. But most important, Microsoft's dominance - its Windows software is used on 85% of the world's computers - is predicated on the people using Intel-style chips. Under the current rules of the game, software designed for one processor will not run on another. For example, a word processor designed for a Macintosh computer will not run on an Intel-based PC. That may be history. Thanks to Torvalds' wizardry, Crusoe will transmute the instructions of other processors into a set the Transmeta chips can understand. The new alchemy is called \"code morphing\" and it threatens Microsoft's doctrine - and, like the US administration's anti-monopolies case, the Seattle company's cash flow. Torvalds, although he denies it, is making a habit of challenging Gates. Whereas Bill Gates has become the richest man in history by controlling the operating system in the home of nearly every computer user on the planet, Torvalds gave his out - over the net - for free. But what is surprising is not what divides them but how much unites them. Both were brattishly clever. Both have come to dominate computer systems around the world. Both have brown hair and wear glasses. The real question is who will get Gates first: the government or the geek. Penny wise... Forget Mike Tyson against Julius Francis. The real bruisers are to be found elsewhere, slugging it out over British membership of the single currency. The latest round will get under way on Monday when global management consultancy AT Kearney unveils its latest foreign direct investment confidence index. The UK had a high ranking in the last of the six-monthly surveys of 155 of the world's biggest firms - it came fourth - and is tipped to have done better this time. This will be seized on immediately by euro-sceptics as evidence that Britain is not being damaged by being out of the single currency zone. Certainly the survey looks likely to present a sharply contrasting view from that expressed somewhat tentatively recently by the trade and industry secretary, Stephen Byers, and more directly by Toyota's honorary chairman, Shoichiro Toyoda. There is no doubt which corner the crowd is cheering for - euroscepticism is on the rise according to the latest opinion polls. There is, however, a danger that the arguments in favour of signing up to the single currency are being subsumed into a related but different argument over the level of the exchange rate. The pound is now at a 14-year high on a trade weighted basis and at a staggering DM3.20. Even Switzerland is starting to look cheap - OK, cheaper. True enough, manufacturing exporters are showing signs of being able to cope - though they can hardly welcome the prospect of further sterling appreciation now being touted in some City circles. Britain's farmers, who have had the double whammy of a rising pound and a fall in agricultural prices, face a further extension of the sector's five-year long recession. But though there will be many in the pro-euro camp who see membership as a solution to the squeeze exerted by the pound's current exchange rate, that is scarcely a sufficient reason in itself for British membership, nor a guaranteed solution for the immediate problem. Some investors may be deterred from investing in Britain because of a perky pound but if the euro's supporters are to mount an effective case they need to broaden the argument.",

      "bodyText": "The Zetters pools business is to be reinvented as an internet betting and gambling business after the founding family yesterday accepted \u00a33.6m to cut its ties with the firm. A consortium of investors including three businessmen with spread betting and conventional gambling backgrounds yesterday agreed a 135p a share deal to buy the 38% of the company still owned by the Zetters, valuing the business at \u00a39.6m. But as details of the deal emerged, investors keen to back internet firms piled in and the shares shot up to 320p, valuing it at \u00a322.8m. Last summer Zetters sold its bingo hall interests to rival Riva, and shrank back to a pure pools business. At the time Paul Zetter, the 74-year-old chairman who inherited the business from his father and has been on the board for more than 40 years, conceded that the company was fighting a losing battle against larger competitiors and the National Lottery, and announced that it was open to takeover bids. Yesterday's successful bid was led by investment bank Durlacher, which specialises in advising internet businesses and took 21% of the 2.7m Zetter family shares for \u00a3775,440. By the time the stock market closed last night its stake was worth \u00a31.84m. Anthony Wollenberg, a senior partner at City solictor Rakisons and a former chairman of spread betting group City Index, has bought 14% of the family shares, along with Jonathan Sparke, founding managing director of City Index. Mr Sparke later joined independent bookie Victor Chandler, where he worked alongside Ben Shaw, a third member of the consortium. Mr Shaw also founded and is a director of NetComs, a specialist e-commerce consultancy. The consortium also includes UAT Dealing, an offshoot of Undervalued Assets Trust - a listed investment trust - and investment funds advised by venture capital group Apax. The traditional Zetters pools business will continue to operate, and Paul Zetter has been installed as life president of the business. The pools business made a profit of \u00a31.54m last year on a turnover of \u00a315.5m. Zetters' net assets are some \u00a36.2m. Under the rules of the takeover code the consortium's offer must be extended to all shareholders, but with the share price so far in excess of the price at which the deal was done, there are unlikely to be any takers. The betting executives moving into the business aim to build the Zetters name into a leading internet betting brand. In a statement, it said: \"The consortium proposes to build upon the brand name of Zetters and, through acquisition, organic growth and the establishment of strategic alliances, to develop an interna tional online betting and gaming business.\" Web betting is regarded as potentially one of the most lucrative e-commerce businesses - and spread betting as a particularly profitable segment of the market. Sports Internet, run by entrepreneurs Chris Akers and Peter Wilkinson, recently bought a bookmaking group with the aim of attracting online punters, and even Ladbrokes has set up an online operation in Gibraltar.",

Round at Port-au-Prince (alias Elm Street), Mama Doc unleashed the serious fraud office on ailing trade finance group Versailles, while it was quite like old times at the DTI, with a QC and an FCA (the DTI's idea of a couple of ordinary chaps) parachuting into the wreckage of TransTec, the Geoffrey Robinson-founded engineering group. Down at Canary Wharf, one might have thought that Howard Davies and his crack sleuths at the financial services authority (FSA) would be browned off by their non-invitation to the party. Not at all. Discussing yesterday regulatory approaches for the new century (or something like that), Mr Davies disclosed that the FSA is busy recruiting. Competition specialists are being hired, it seems, along with experts in consumer affairs. Then there's a corps of league-table compilers to be assembled. And, finally, a group of boffins skilled in cost-benefit analysis, doubtless to discover whether or not the new staff (including themselves) are worth employing. </p> <p>\u0095 Back at Versailles, and founder Carl Cushnie was very cross on December 20 with \"wholly inaccurate\" press coverage of his company's woes. Doubtless all the negative publicity was very distressing in the comparison to the sort of treatment he is used to from the media. In June 1999 (as Versailles' problems were starting to mount) Mr Cushnie - billed as Europe's wealthiest black man - spoke to Pride, a magazine aimed at high-flying black Britons, in an exclusive interview. Despite running to three pages, no hint emerged of the DTI's interest in the group, but then Mr Cushnie had taken one elementary precaution - through his family interests, he is the publisher of Pride. After a series of hard-hitting questions - \"What kinds of music do you like listening to?\", \"Are you an over-indulgent father?\" (respectively Beethoven's 7th and \"No\") - Pride did elicit one interesting answer, when Mr Cushnie commented thus on his thrusting young staff: \"I understand when they succeed how they feel about it. It's not about money for them, it's a game. And I don't mean game in the trivial sense, there are rules of engagement.\" Yes, quite. </p> <p>\u0095 His bankers, meanwhile, are totting up the damage from their backing of Mr Cushnie's gamesmanship. Simpletons might wonder why Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays and NatWest did not make loans direct to the struggling businesses concerned rather than use Versailles as middleman (Royal Bank actually referred clients to the company). Ah-ha, well prudential practice, you see, means that banks lend only to firms with strong balance sheets, ruling out the strugglers and ruling in, er, Versailles. As a result of all this prudence, the banks could be down more than \u00a350m. </p> <p>\u0095 NatWest, famously, has other things on its mind, not least the assault from fellow Versailles bankroller Royal Bank. On another flank, NatWest is under attack from Bank of Scotland which has, we learn, sent a 100-strong undercover squad into NatWest branches to open accounts. Rule one for all staff engaged in these gumshoe activities is first to remove the BoS corporate tie, which is regulation issue. Alert NatWest clerks ought presumably to refer new customers with Scottish accents and open-necked shirts to the nearest security guard. </p> <p>\u0095 Pricewaterhouse Coopers, the accountancy giant, ended the week level after a couple of nailbiting spins of the wheel. Monday they were the dunces who, as auditors of TransTec, had failed to spot that \u00a312m claim from car group Ford.

      "bodyText": "\u0095 What a week it has been for Britain's fraudbusters. Round at Port-au-Prince (alias Elm Street), Mama Doc unleashed the serious fraud office on ailing trade finance group Versailles, while it was quite like old times at the DTI, with a QC and an FCA (the DTI's idea of a couple of ordinary chaps) parachuting into the wreckage of TransTec, the Geoffrey Robinson-founded engineering group. Down at Canary Wharf, one might have thought that Howard Davies and his crack sleuths at the financial services authority (FSA) would be browned off by their non-invitation to the party. Not at all. Discussing yesterday regulatory approaches for the new century (or something like that), Mr Davies disclosed that the FSA is busy recruiting. Competition specialists are being hired, it seems, along with experts in consumer affairs. Then there's a corps of league-table compilers to be assembled. And, finally, a group of boffins skilled in cost-benefit analysis, doubtless to discover whether or not the new staff (including themselves) are worth employing. \u0095 Back at Versailles, and founder Carl Cushnie was very cross on December 20 with \"wholly inaccurate\" press coverage of his company's woes. Doubtless all the negative publicity was very distressing in the comparison to the sort of treatment he is used to from the media. In June 1999 (as Versailles' problems were starting to mount) Mr Cushnie - billed as Europe's wealthiest black man - spoke to Pride, a magazine aimed at high-flying black Britons, in an exclusive interview. Despite running to three pages, no hint emerged of the DTI's interest in the group, but then Mr Cushnie had taken one elementary precaution - through his family interests, he is the publisher of Pride. After a series of hard-hitting questions - \"What kinds of music do you like listening to?\", \"Are you an over-indulgent father?\" (respectively Beethoven's 7th and \"No\") - Pride did elicit one interesting answer, when Mr Cushnie commented thus on his thrusting young staff: \"I understand when they succeed how they feel about it. It's not about money for them, it's a game. And I don't mean game in the trivial sense, there are rules of engagement.\" Yes, quite. \u0095 His bankers, meanwhile, are totting up the damage from their backing of Mr Cushnie's gamesmanship. Simpletons might wonder why Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays and NatWest did not make loans direct to the struggling businesses concerned rather than use Versailles as middleman (Royal Bank actually referred clients to the company). Ah-ha, well prudential practice, you see, means that banks lend only to firms with strong balance sheets, ruling out the strugglers and ruling in, er, Versailles. As a result of all this prudence, the banks could be down more than \u00a350m. \u0095 NatWest, famously, has other things on its mind, not least the assault from fellow Versailles bankroller Royal Bank. On another flank, NatWest is under attack from Bank of Scotland which has, we learn, sent a 100-strong undercover squad into NatWest branches to open accounts. Rule one for all staff engaged in these gumshoe activities is first to remove the BoS corporate tie, which is regulation issue. Alert NatWest clerks ought presumably to refer new customers with Scottish accents and open-necked shirts to the nearest security guard. \u0095 Pricewaterhouse Coopers, the accountancy giant, ended the week level after a couple of nailbiting spins of the wheel. Monday they were the dunces who, as auditors of TransTec, had failed to spot that \u00a312m claim from car group Ford. By Friday, they were the Holmesian geniuses who, acting on behalf of the abovementioned banks, had swiftly located multi-million pound gaps in the books of Versailles, thus bringing in both the tontons macoutes and the receivers. Others were less lucky. Buchanan, the City PR firm that defended Versailles so valiantly, is likely to stand at the end of a long queue of creditors. We cannot help but think that top solicitors Ashurst Morris Crisp - hastily engaged as the sewage hit the ventilation equipment - have been less trusting in securing their remuneration.

      "bodyText": "Tumbling with-profits bonus rates spell more problems for endowment mortgage homebuyers. And with the near certainty of further falls in future years, each cut heightens the chance of premium increases if policies are to repay loans. And that also means one of the most powerful endowment sales pledges - the promise that with-profits backed homebuyers would get a tax-free lump sum on top of the loan repayment when the policy matured - has receded further into the mists of oblivion. Most of the with-profits companies that have so far declared 1999 results, have slashed annual, or \"reversionary\", bonus rates. There are usually two bonus figures, one based on the sum assured and the second a bonus on previous gains. Scottish Provident has cut its figure from 3% to 2.5% on the sum assured and from 4.5% to 3.75% on previously declared bonuses. And Royal London, rated one of the top with-profits firms, has slashed its total annual bonus package by a fifth.

But none has a record that satisfies FoE. And three - Equitable Life, Clerical Medical and Scottish Widows - refused to answer any questions on sustainable development or on whether the insurer carries out screening of companies in mainstream funds. </p> <p>They were even silent on whether they had an ethical fund available to the public. Scottish Widows says it could find no record of any questionnaire, but FoE says all the no-shows were reminded. </p> <p>But leaving aside the no-shows, there was a wide spread of answers from the life insurers. FoE has ranked Scottish Equitable and Allied Dunbar as having the most environment-friendly policies while Axa Sun Life and Norwich Union - both have ethical funds - are at the bottom of the table. </p> <p>The lobbying group also checked recent unit trust statements to see if they invested in 14 multinational companies including ICI, Monsanto, Exxon, Rio Tinto and Zeneca.

      "bodyText": "UK insurance companies have come under pressure to sharpen up ethical investment policies following a report from green campaign group Friends of the Earth (FoE) this week. Capital Punishment: The Insurance Industry and the Global Environment, names and shames top life companies which invest in businesses which FoE says harm the environment. FoE also claim that short-term investment policies could be storing up long-term problems, with insurance companies in the front line of the predicted storm with climate change and resulting claims for damage and death set to batter their reserves. FoE policy director Tony Juniper says: \"We found that most major insurers are investing in the very firms that we and others have been campaigning against because of their particularly bad environmental performance.\" Many of the 14 life firms listed as holders of shares in companies harming the planet also offer ethical funds to private investors. But none has a record that satisfies FoE. And three - Equitable Life, Clerical Medical and Scottish Widows - refused to answer any questions on sustainable development or on whether the insurer carries out screening of companies in mainstream funds. They were even silent on whether they had an ethical fund available to the public. Scottish Widows says it could find no record of any questionnaire, but FoE says all the no-shows were reminded. But leaving aside the no-shows, there was a wide spread of answers from the life insurers. FoE has ranked Scottish Equitable and Allied Dunbar as having the most environment-friendly policies while Axa Sun Life and Norwich Union - both have ethical funds - are at the bottom of the table. The lobbying group also checked recent unit trust statements to see if they invested in 14 multinational companies including ICI, Monsanto, Exxon, Rio Tinto and Zeneca. Collectively it accuses these firms of harming the environment, abusing human rights, or reducing bio-diversity. Legal &amp; General is good on most counts although it is an investor in 11 out of the 14 \"no-no\" stocks. It says many of these shares are held in passive index tracking funds so it cannot avoid them. The report concludes that most major UK insurers operate,\"very poor and inadequate environmental investment policies\". The good news for ethical investors is that this report adds to the increasing pressure on fund managers and pension trustees to clean up their acts and adopt ethical investment strategies. But the biggest boost to the SRI (socially responsible investment) movement over the next few years will be the introduction of the government's new pension legislation in July when pension fund trustees will have to state whether they have any ethical investment policy and, if so, what it is. Company pension scheme members will be told for the first time what ethical and environmental principles are taken into account when money is invested on their behalf in their pension. And they'll be able to ask questions of pension trustees about ethical issues which could have a financial impact on their pension fund's future performance. Many pension funds are expected to adopt an ethical investment strategy as a result of the new regulations. The giant institutional investment managers are already gearing up to satisfy the anticipated demand for investment policies with an ethical slant. Prudential Portfolio Managers, one of the biggest, says it will soon be introducing screening on a range of environmental and social issues across its entire UK investment portfolio. A growing realisation that environmental factors can have a direct impact on the financial performance of companies means fund managers are moving away from the negative screening and sector avoidance approach traditionally associated with ethical funds. \u0095 Copies of FoE's report Capital Punishment: The Insurance Industry and the Global Environment , price \u00a310, are available on 0171 490 1555 .

The court of appeal ruled that the company's decision to cut valuable final bonuses payable to 90,000 pension policyholders was unlawful. It said the company should pay the money to holders of \"guaranteed annuity rate\" policies. However, the 238-year-old company immediately said it would be appealing against the ruling to the House of Lords, leaving the policyholders, many of them elderly, in limbo once again. The judgment will send shockwaves through the insurance industry, with Scottish Widows and MGM Assurance among the firms which have issued similar policies. The guaranteed annuities were sold as part of pension plans between 1957 and 1988. Those who bought policies with this option believed it would assure them of a guaranteed minimum income at retirement. But annuity rates have plummeted in the past few years, which means that the guarantees, which promised rates of 11% and above, have become very costly. Market annuity rates are now about 8% or 9%. While many other life companies decided to absorb the costs, Equitable Life infuriated many of its customers by announcing it would pay lower final bonuses to policyholders who opted to exercise the guarantee. The company said it had the right to vary final bonus payments, but customers who bought these plans claimed it was reneging on promises, which in some cases add hundreds of thousands of pounds to people's pensions. They claim they were promised a minimum annuity rate and full final bonuses. Equitable Life won the first round of the legal battle in the High Court last September when vice-chancellor Sir Richard Scott ruled the society was acting lawfully in cutting final bonuses to guaranteed annuity policyholders. But the Court of Appeal overturned the judgment by a majority of two to one, with Lord Woolf, master of the rolls, stating it was \"not a permissible exercise of discretion\" for the insurer to apply different rates for final bonuses depending on how a policyholder chose to take their benefits. Equitable Life said it was \"disappointed\" at the decision but was pleased that its current approach to the issue \"can be maintained pending the result in the House of Lords\". The judgment delighted David Hyman, 69, a retired stockbroker chosen as the representative defendant for the policyholders. He has held policies with the company since 1970. \"The policyholders have been very badly treated.

      "bodyText": "The government sought yesterday to place consumer interests at the heart of utility regulation when it tabled a new bill designed to impose sweeping changes on the privatised electricity, water and gas industries. Publishing his long-awaited utilities bill, trade and industry secretary Stephen Byers promised the measures would ensure \"first class utilities for all consumers at lower prices\". Among the pledges are a promise to cut electricity bills by 10%, and a commitment to bring new powers to bear on the industries so that fuel poverty and poor performance can be tackled more effectively. The bill also promises tough fines for companies guilty of bad practice such as mis-selling, interruption to supply and tardy reconnection. The fines will have no upper limit. The measures follow long-standing criticism of the privatised utilities by Labour when it was in opposition. The party pledged at the time to revamp regulation so that consumer interests would be better protected. Yesterday's bill follows publication earlier of official proposals, and consultation. The market reacted calmly to the news, which had been anticipated. Shares in National Power closed 3p higher at 378p, while PowerGen shares closed 26p higher at 489p. Shares in United Utilities ended the session at 622p, down 1p, while Centrica shares closed 1p higher at 180p. The electricity industry welcomed the measures in the bill aimed at ensuring greater regulatory stability. Philip Daubeney, chief executive of the Electricity Association, said the industry had been working closely with the government on the measures and that the industry was pleased with the \"broad thrust\". But he warned: \"The government is giving itself considerable new powers to direct regulation. We want to see these used judiciously and transparently, with proper consultation, avoiding regulatory shocks which have the effect of increasing uncertainty, which in turn leads to increased costs.\" Environmentalists criticised the bill for encouraging higher energy consumption by cutting prices. Friends of the Earth said that the new law ought to be accompanied by measures to increase renewable energy generation and more use of combined heat and power systems. The Worldwide Fund for Nature said the bill abolished a regime that supported the development of emerging technologies used in renewable energy, without putting an alternative system of support in its place.

The work is set to a percussion score with the strident beat of a street carnival, and the dancers surf upon characteristically Tharpian extremes of vernacular and virtuoso dance. </p> <p>Jaffe started out looking jittery but by the end of the duet had loosened into a stylish mix of acerbic wit and ballerina delicacy. Steifel, however, was a star from the moment he stepped onstage.

Confounding his own antichrist image as arch desecrator of classical principles, Forsythe's surprising little show-stopper proves he can do ballet like the best of them. Not only is the work set to the impeccably classical music of Schubert (rather than Forsythe's preferred electronic scores) but its five dancers are spun through almost every classroom step in the book. </p> <p>As the title suggests, this is an outright celebration of the precision and speed unique to ballet, but it's also a wicked exaggeration. Familiar steps become barely visible as they race on each others heels, change direction and then link in perilous combinations. Forsythe contains the whole breathtaking flurry within a very untypical classical decorum, and the audience loved it. </p> <p>They also loved Darcey Bussell, despite the fact that she was performing Peter Martin's silly duet from his Barber Violin Concerto.

Here he is a lonely Dublin undertaker, John Plunkett, confronted on Christmas Eve by the ghosts of his past. As the title implies, there are strong Dickensian echoes, but Plunkett is less a Dublin Scrooge than a reformed alcoholic. In the first and third scenes he recalls, for the benefit of his young assistant, the terrors of cyclical drinking and the seeming impossibility of escape.

If I love it less than The Weir, the reasons are partly structural. Each of the three scenes is a two-hander in which Plunkett does most of the talking. I like McPherson more when he offers interplay of character.
