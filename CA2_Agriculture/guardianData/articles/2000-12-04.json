And she would have Brooklyn to look after as well. </p> <p>Cheap shot, I know. David, bless him, whom we saw being photographed for Esquire, was at least honest about the fun of the photo-shoot. \"You can order anything you want; pizza, McDonald's, and somebody brings it for you.\" </p> <p>He was also photographed, in his lovely home, by OK! magazine, whose editor, my old friend Martin Townsend, suggested David do \"the shaving thing\" because the bathroom was \"really cool\". He also photographed Becks with his CD collection, doing the \"music thing\". This truly was life in a goldfish bowl, but a goldfish bowl of the footballer's own choosing. One assumes the thrust behind the TV show was flogging copies of Becks's book, but as a documentary - a soccumentary if you will - the programme was pointless. It showed us Beckham \"doing the shaving thing\", but not shaving. </p> <p>It should be pointed out that Beckham is undoubtedly the most talented English footballer of his generation. Similar could not be said of Neville, a solid Premiership defender who has had the good fortune to find himself in an outstanding side in the charge of a uniquely gifted manager. </p> <p>Neville was unwise enough to allow the cameras to keep rolling when they entered through his big wrought iron electronically operated gates.

      "bodyText": "Neil Lennon expects his \u00a35.5m move to Celtic to go through today after his transfer request was accepted by the Leicester manager Peter Taylor. The deal ends Martin O'Neill's protracted attempts to sign the midfielder, whom he took to Leicester from Crewe for \u00a3750,000 in 1996. O'Neill first tried to take Lennon to Scotland in the summer and was invited by Taylor to make another offer last month. \"It's been playing on my mind a bit,\" said Lennon, who will take a wage cut to join Celtic and said that in addition he had agreed to waive signing-on fees he was due from Leicester. \"It's been the hardest decision of my life but I'm leaving the club in really good shape. \"Peter Taylor has been absolutely brilliant about it. He's a great coach and I think he can take Leicester to another level. I love it here and it will be a wrench. \"You have to be Irish to understand the pull of Celtic. They are a massive, massive club. I'm 29 and I think the time is right for a new challenge.\" Lennon's future team-mates extended their Bank of Scotland Premier League lead to 10 points before yesterday's games with a 3-1 win over Dunfermline on Saturday. Celtic continue to try to level the playing field, however, as they once more conceded an early goal. But they responded to Jason Dair's first-minute strike with goals from Lubo Moravcik, Henrik Larsson and Tommy Johnson. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

Alan Lee first steered the ball over the line after Artell headed on a long throw and, though Mark Ifill had a chance to win it for Millwall and shot instead at the keeper, Lee then decided it the other way from close range after Mark Robins's effort was blocked. \"The system they play, 3-4-3, gives you problems,\" admitted McGhee, who after a self-imposed moratorium in the market admits he is looking to bring in a couple of players. \"Teams with a back four may end up getting their full-backs tied down and teams with a three [at the back] have to change because you can't play three against a three.\" It must have been music to the ears of Moore, who led Rotherham to promotion last season and as a result of these three points saw his team, who have scored in every one of their league games, move above Millwall and into second place. \"When the season started we would have settled for coming fifth bottom,\" Moore said. \"If we finish fifth bottom now we've had a nightmare.\" \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "body": "<p>As ghosts go, the spectre that haunts Portman Road is rather callow, only seven years old. But it has still given everyone the jitters. \"Remember '93?\" they say with a ghastly smile and a little shudder. </p> <p>Ipswich were champions of the old Second Division in 1991-92. By January 1993 John Lyall's side were the fourth best side in the country. </p> <p>They had beaten Manchester United, and on Match of the Day Trevor Brooking described them as genuine title contenders. But after that they dropped faster than Isaac Newton's Granny Smith and in the end only just avoided relegation. </p> <p>That might explain why, on Saturday, they looked down when they should have looked up. Vertigo took over and they slumped, dizzily, from third to fifth in the table. </p> <p>Despite the astonishing success of this essentially small club, winning the league championship under Sir Alf Ramsey and various cups under Bobby Robson, the memories of 1993 are more sharply etched on the memory. And they are approaching the halfway point in the season, the stage when everything went wrong before. </p> <p>On Saturday they might have climbed to second in the Premiership. But their manager George Burley refuses to indulge the raised expectations of the club's supporters. He continues to insist that to finish fourth from bottom - 42 points will be enough, he reckons - would represent a successful season. </p> <p>This result, though disappointing, has not totally dismayed everyone at Portman Road, especially if it helps to bring a few people down to earth. </p> <p>Despite their lofty position Ipswich have won only three of their eight home games. But they have rarely played as badly as this, and this morning Burley must be reflecting on the curse of the manager of the month award. </p> <p>Against Derby, their forwards David Johnson and Marcus Stewart failed to gel. They duplicate rather than complement each other; too often they are looking to make the same run into enemy territory. </p> <p>It was in their build-up play, however, that Ipswich malfunctioned more seriously. It has been their passing and movement which have really caught the eye this season, especially down the left, where Hermann Hreidarsson, Jamie Clapham and Mark Venus have interchanged pleasingly. Not so here. </p> <p>Derby, though, must take some credit for lifting themselves out of the bottom three with their first away win since January. They also have more clean sheets than your local launderette; this was their fourth in five Premiership matches. The return of Horacio Carbonari and the arrival of Taribo West have been crucial factors here, as has the presence of their new assistant manager Colin Todd. </p> <p>\"They never got in behind us, did they?\" remarked the old miser of Brian Clough's successful Derby. \"It was backs-to-wall stuff for a lot of the match because Ipswich put us under a lot of pressure. But we restricted them to two or three chances.\" </p> <p>Derby scored their goal in the 28th minute. Rory Delap cut in from the left and beat Ipswich's stand-in keeper Keith Branagan with a shot that was deflected by Jermaine Wright. </p> <p>After that Derby put even more players behind the ball. And Ipswich may yet have to call in the ghostbusters to banish the ghouls of '93. </p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

Vertigo took over and they slumped, dizzily, from third to fifth in the table. Despite the astonishing success of this essentially small club, winning the league championship under Sir Alf Ramsey and various cups under Bobby Robson, the memories of 1993 are more sharply etched on the memory. And they are approaching the halfway point in the season, the stage when everything went wrong before. On Saturday they might have climbed to second in the Premiership. But their manager George Burley refuses to indulge the raised expectations of the club's supporters. He continues to insist that to finish fourth from bottom - 42 points will be enough, he reckons - would represent a successful season. This result, though disappointing, has not totally dismayed everyone at Portman Road, especially if it helps to bring a few people down to earth. Despite their lofty position Ipswich have won only three of their eight home games. But they have rarely played as badly as this, and this morning Burley must be reflecting on the curse of the manager of the month award. Against Derby, their forwards David Johnson and Marcus Stewart failed to gel. They duplicate rather than complement each other; too often they are looking to make the same run into enemy territory. It was in their build-up play, however, that Ipswich malfunctioned more seriously. It has been their passing and movement which have really caught the eye this season, especially down the left, where Hermann Hreidarsson, Jamie Clapham and Mark Venus have interchanged pleasingly. Not so here. Derby, though, must take some credit for lifting themselves out of the bottom three with their first away win since January. They also have more clean sheets than your local launderette; this was their fourth in five Premiership matches. The return of Horacio Carbonari and the arrival of Taribo West have been crucial factors here, as has the presence of their new assistant manager Colin Todd. \"They never got in behind us, did they?\" remarked the old miser of Brian Clough's successful Derby. \"It was backs-to-wall stuff for a lot of the match because Ipswich put us under a lot of pressure. But we restricted them to two or three chances.\" Derby scored their goal in the 28th minute. Rory Delap cut in from the left and beat Ipswich's stand-in keeper Keith Branagan with a shot that was deflected by Jermaine Wright. After that Derby put even more players behind the ball. And Ipswich may yet have to call in the ghostbusters to banish the ghouls of '93. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Officially there is no crisis but just in case there was Chelsea made a drama out of it yesterday. What appeared to be a straightforward home win by the better team became an undignified scramble for victory as Manchester City came close to forcing a draw in the closing minutes. </p> <p>Not that beating City said a great deal about Chelsea's chances of turning their season around. Their ability to win at home has never been in doubt. It is their insipid away form that has dragged them into the bottom half of the table. </p> <p>Chelsea's next away fixture is at Middlesbrough, where their credibility can hardly afford the sort of defeat they suffered at Bradford in August. Then they travel to Ipswich, West Ham, Arsenal and Leicester City, none of whom is giving away much. </p> <p>This was Manchester City's sixth successive league defeat and they are now only two points above the bottom three. Though they arguably deserved one for effort yesterday, a draw would have been due as much to Chelsea dropping a gear as City raising their game. </p> <p>Take away the critical froth that has followed the clear-out of Gianluca Vialli's staff by his successor Claudio Ranieri, and Chelsea are simply a good side suffering an indifferent patch. The quality has not disappeared but Ranieri has yet to achieve the consistency of performance needed to make Europe. </p> <p>Even now a feeling of old-time music hall lingers on at Chelsea. The chairman and his gavel bang on about the press - \"a mendacious, malevolent manifestation of muddled media muck-raking\". All right, Ken Bates does not use quite those words but that is roughly the sense of it. The monologue, meantime, is provided by the managing director, Colin Hutchinson, who remains firm in his belief that Ranieri will get it right. </p> <p>Ranieri has declared that if Chelsea are not champions by the time he has completed his three-year contract he will consider himself a failure, a rash pronouncement considering the title has come once to Stamford Bridge in 95 years. </p> <p>City came having conceded 13 goals in their four previous visits to London this season, one of those a scoreless game at Tottenham. Much of their performance yesterday supported Joe Royle's claim that they had not been playing badly, just letting the opposition score. </p> <p>Until recently Royle's side were doing better on their return to the elite than many predicted but newly promoted teams often start to feel the pressure once the clocks have gone back, and for City spring is beginning to look a long way. They are a busy-beaverish side, typified by hard-working footballers such as Danny Tiatto, Jeff Whitley and Shaun Wright-Phillips, yet make the sort of errors that are more likely to be punished at this level than they are in the Nationwide League. </p> <p>Yesterday was a good example.

      "bodyText": "Officially there is no crisis but just in case there was Chelsea made a drama out of it yesterday. What appeared to be a straightforward home win by the better team became an undignified scramble for victory as Manchester City came close to forcing a draw in the closing minutes. Not that beating City said a great deal about Chelsea's chances of turning their season around. Their ability to win at home has never been in doubt. It is their insipid away form that has dragged them into the bottom half of the table. Chelsea's next away fixture is at Middlesbrough, where their credibility can hardly afford the sort of defeat they suffered at Bradford in August. Then they travel to Ipswich, West Ham, Arsenal and Leicester City, none of whom is giving away much. This was Manchester City's sixth successive league defeat and they are now only two points above the bottom three. Though they arguably deserved one for effort yesterday, a draw would have been due as much to Chelsea dropping a gear as City raising their game. Take away the critical froth that has followed the clear-out of Gianluca Vialli's staff by his successor Claudio Ranieri, and Chelsea are simply a good side suffering an indifferent patch. The quality has not disappeared but Ranieri has yet to achieve the consistency of performance needed to make Europe. Even now a feeling of old-time music hall lingers on at Chelsea. The chairman and his gavel bang on about the press - \"a mendacious, malevolent manifestation of muddled media muck-raking\". All right, Ken Bates does not use quite those words but that is roughly the sense of it. The monologue, meantime, is provided by the managing director, Colin Hutchinson, who remains firm in his belief that Ranieri will get it right. Ranieri has declared that if Chelsea are not champions by the time he has completed his three-year contract he will consider himself a failure, a rash pronouncement considering the title has come once to Stamford Bridge in 95 years. City came having conceded 13 goals in their four previous visits to London this season, one of those a scoreless game at Tottenham. Much of their performance yesterday supported Joe Royle's claim that they had not been playing badly, just letting the opposition score. Until recently Royle's side were doing better on their return to the elite than many predicted but newly promoted teams often start to feel the pressure once the clocks have gone back, and for City spring is beginning to look a long way. They are a busy-beaverish side, typified by hard-working footballers such as Danny Tiatto, Jeff Whitley and Shaun Wright-Phillips, yet make the sort of errors that are more likely to be punished at this level than they are in the Nationwide League. Yesterday was a good example. For much of the first half Alf Inge Haaland and Whitley matched a Chelsea midfield lacking the suspended Dennis Wise but augmented by Ranieri's decision to move Marcel Desailly out of defence into the anchor role he filled at Milan. Passing the ball neatly City dominated Chelsea territorially without creating a clear-cut opening. But they restricted the opposition to a header from Desailly, after a corner from Gianfranco Zola, that Tiatto nodded off the line. Zola so clearly held the key to Chelsea's chances of breaking City down that it was surprising Royle's players allowed him so much space. On 27 minutes the Italian followed a run to the byline with a centre from which Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink's header skimmed the crossbar. Another minute and Chelsea were ahead. Haaland, off balance as he received a throw-in deep in the City half, could only prod the ball forward to Zola, who steered it beyond Nicky Weaver's left hand and inside the far post. After this Ranieri withdrew Desailly to the back three, allowing Celestine Babayaro's forward runs to give Chelsea extra width on the left. By half-time the contest looked over. In the 45th minute Zola's inspired through-pass released Mario Melchiot for the low centre from which Hasselbaink drove in his 11th league goal of the season. But Chelsea were increasingly forced on the defensive in the second half and after the City substitute Paul Dickov had scored from the rebound when Ed de Goey blocked a drive from Kevin Horlock, Stamford Bridge lived on its nerves until the final whistle. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

However, the state case is \"on hold,\" Terre Cass, a circuit court spokeswoman told reporters in Tallahassee, Florida.</p> <p>On today's supreme court ruling, Fred H Bartlit, a lawyer for Mr Bush, said he had not yet studied it but added: \"Apparently what they said as near as we can make out is that they can't figure out what the Florida supreme court based its decision on, whether constitutional grounds or Florida state laws.\"</p> <p>The court held a dramatic argument session on Friday after agreeing a week earlier to hear Mr Bush's appeal of the Florida court ruling, which extended the deadline for reporting recount results from November 14 to November 26.</p> <p>The justices had appeared deeply divided over whether there were grounds to overrule the state court.</p> <p>Another lawyer for Mr Bush, Theodore Olson, argued that the Florida supreme court's decision to allow the extended recount \"overturned the carefully enacted plan\" by state legislators for resolving election disputes.</p> <p>He contended the state court violated the constitution and an 1887 federal law that makes states' choice of presidential electors binding on Congress as long as disputes were resolved under laws enacted before the election.

      "bodyText": "The US supreme court today set aside the Florida supreme court decision that had let hand-counted ballots narrow George W Bush's lead over Al Gore in the state that will decide who wins the White House. In an unsigned decision, the justices said there was uncertainty about the Florida court's grounds for issuing its ruling that allowed hand-recounted votes to be added to the total. The justices said: \"This is sufficient reason for us to decline at this time to review the federal questions asserted to be present. \"After reviewing the opinion of the Florida supreme court, we find that there is considerable uncertainty as to the precise grounds for the decision.\" The action was not a ruling for Mr Bush on the merits of his appeal but by setting aside the Florida supreme court's ruling, it could place in doubt the gains Mr Gore made through the hand recount in the days after November 14. The decision may appear on the surface to be a major setback for Mr Gore but there is a prospect the Florida supreme court may still stand by their decision to allow hand-counted ballots. Mr Gore also has other legal avenues which he is pursuing, although the consensus among commentators is that the longer the contest drags on, the more acute the pressure on him to bow out becomes. The vice president is hoping today for a victory in the Florida courts where a ruling is pending on whether to overturn Mr Bush's certified win in Florida and order manual recount of thousands of ballots. Circuit judge N Sanders Sauls promised to rule quickly on Mr Gore's legal bid which was expected around 5.00pm GMT. However, the state case is \"on hold,\" Terre Cass, a circuit court spokeswoman told reporters in Tallahassee, Florida. On today's supreme court ruling, Fred H Bartlit, a lawyer for Mr Bush, said he had not yet studied it but added: \"Apparently what they said as near as we can make out is that they can't figure out what the Florida supreme court based its decision on, whether constitutional grounds or Florida state laws.\" The court held a dramatic argument session on Friday after agreeing a week earlier to hear Mr Bush's appeal of the Florida court ruling, which extended the deadline for reporting recount results from November 14 to November 26. The justices had appeared deeply divided over whether there were grounds to overrule the state court. Another lawyer for Mr Bush, Theodore Olson, argued that the Florida supreme court's decision to allow the extended recount \"overturned the carefully enacted plan\" by state legislators for resolving election disputes. He contended the state court violated the constitution and an 1887 federal law that makes states' choice of presidential electors binding on Congress as long as disputes were resolved under laws enacted before the election. Laurence Tribe, a lawyer for Mr Gore, said the recount process merely was \"like looking more closely at the film of a photo finish. It's nothing extraordinary.\" He added, \"Why tell people the count if you won't count it?\" Mr Gore's advisers were telling allies after the argument that the vice president would continue pressing his election contest in Florida courts regardless of what the supreme Court decided. Florida's secretary of state, Katherine Harris, certified Bush the winner in Florida on Nov. 26 after manual recounts in a few Democratic-leaning counties that Mr Gore had sought. The state supreme court had ordered those recounts to proceed beyond the November 14 date that Harris cited as the deadline fixed in state law. A key issue before the supreme court was whether the case involved any federal issue that warranted overturning Florida's highest court. In recent years, the supreme court has carried out what some observers call a states' rights revolution, tilting the federal-state balance toward the states in a series of 5-4 votes with the chief justice, William Rehnquist, leading the majority.

Mr Hume made it known at the end of August that he wished to leave the assembly to spend more time on his roles as MP in Westminster and Europe. He has had health problems for some time, and last year underwent surgery for a ruptured intestine.</p> <p>There is little question, however, of Mr Hume retiring from the public life he has pursued for more than 30 years.</p> <p>He was first sucked into the maelstrom of Northern Irish politics in the late 60s, when he was a young French teacher in his beloved home city of Derry. As an ardent nationalist, Mr Hume plunged into the front line of the civil rights campaign. But when that campaign degenerated into violent clashes with the police and then the British army, he continued to press for political reform rather than revolutionary change.</p> <p>It was, to put it mildly, a turbulent time, and Mr Hume was in the thick of things. He was regularly seen in the heart of the Derry action, striding through the tear gas or dodging rubber bullets; never afraid to confront the security forces, but always urging peaceful protest.</p> <p>He was a regular at the City Hotel, home and headquarters to the burgeoning press corps. Sometimes he would turn up drenched in the purple dye used by the army to identify rioters, and always he would be loquacious, passionate and eager for debate.</p> <p>He was also given, late at night when even he had wearied of the incessant talk, to spirited renditions of \"Danny Boy\" and other favourites in the hotel bar.</p> <p>In 1970, together with the young Turks of the civil rights movement Austin Currie and Ivan Cooper, and veteran socialist activists Paddy Devlin and Gerry Fitt, he helped found the Social Democratic and Labour party, to bind together the various strands of non-militant nationalism in the six counties.</p> <p>Mr Fitt was elected the first leader of the party, with Mr Hume as his deputy. There followed the frightening and frustrating tumble of events which brought down the old Unionist provincial government at Stormont, the introduction of direct rule by London, and the first doomed attempt to set up a power-sharing devolved government.</p> <p>Mr Hume was tireless. His ponderous public style betrayed a quicksilver ability to analyse the issues, and a tireless capacity for dialogue.</p> <p>The power-sharing experiment collapsed and as the province seemed to slide towards an uncontainable civil war, Mr Hume scoured the wreckage, looking for pieces to rebuild into a coherent strategy.</p> <p>He played a leading role in the constitutional convention and other attempts to put some wheels back onto the wreckage of local politics. He also patrolled Dublin and London, lobbying and manoeuvering and nudging the British and Irish towards a new cooperative approach.</p> <p>In the mid-80s that process was well under way, but it seemed incapable of producing any lasting benefits to a province exhausted by 15 years of communal violence. Mr Hume, typically, thought through his analysis and came up with a radical new line.</p> <p>He decided that Sinn Fein, the political label used by the Provisional IRA, should be engaged in the political process. To that end, he set up a series of cloak-and-dagger meetings with Gerry Adams, a pivotal figure in both the political and paramilitary wings of the republican movement.</p> <p>When the Hume-Adams dialogue, as it was labelled, became public knowledge in 1993, there was a storm of protest. Much of it, predictably, came from unionists and loyalists scandalised by any dealings with republican \"terrorists\". But Mr Hume was also savagely attacked by members of his own party, who felt that in lending credibility to Sinn Fein, he was electorally sabotaging his own party.</p> <p>With typical tenacity, Mr Hume persevered in his confidence-building mission, and the wheels of negotiation began to turn. In the mid-90s came the important breakthrough of the IRA ceasefire; wobbly at first and still flawed, but holding nonetheless to this day.</p> <p>Anglo-Irish cooperation, together with US mediation, eventually produced the momentous agreement known as the Good Friday deal, allowing for power-sharing, new all-Ireland bodies and verification of paramilitary disarmament. It's shaky still, but it survives, resting on the foundations built very largely by Mr Hume.</p> <p>In 1998, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize jointly with the Unionist party leader David Trimble. Long before that, as a Euro-MP and as an inveterate builder of political deals, he had developed a great taste for international politics. From the outset of the Good Friday process, he eschewed any role in the provincial shenanigans of Belfast, preferring the wider stages of Dublin, London, Brussels and beyond.</p> <p><b>Useful links</b> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Northern_Ireland/Story/0,2763,361214,00.html\">Mr Hume's August announcement</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.sdlp.ie/\" target=\"_NEW\">Social Democratic and Labour party</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.sdlp.ie/history60s.htm\" target=\"_NEW\">History of the SDLP</a> <br><a href=\"http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/peace/docs/nobeljh.htm\" target=\"_NEW\">Mr Hume's 1998 Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech</a></p>",

Mr Hume made it known at the end of August that he wished to leave the assembly to spend more time on his roles as MP in Westminster and Europe. He has had health problems for some time, and last year underwent surgery for a ruptured intestine. There is little question, however, of Mr Hume retiring from the public life he has pursued for more than 30 years. He was first sucked into the maelstrom of Northern Irish politics in the late 60s, when he was a young French teacher in his beloved home city of Derry. As an ardent nationalist, Mr Hume plunged into the front line of the civil rights campaign. But when that campaign degenerated into violent clashes with the police and then the British army, he continued to press for political reform rather than revolutionary change. It was, to put it mildly, a turbulent time, and Mr Hume was in the thick of things. He was regularly seen in the heart of the Derry action, striding through the tear gas or dodging rubber bullets; never afraid to confront the security forces, but always urging peaceful protest. He was a regular at the City Hotel, home and headquarters to the burgeoning press corps. Sometimes he would turn up drenched in the purple dye used by the army to identify rioters, and always he would be loquacious, passionate and eager for debate. He was also given, late at night when even he had wearied of the incessant talk, to spirited renditions of \"Danny Boy\" and other favourites in the hotel bar. In 1970, together with the young Turks of the civil rights movement Austin Currie and Ivan Cooper, and veteran socialist activists Paddy Devlin and Gerry Fitt, he helped found the Social Democratic and Labour party, to bind together the various strands of non-militant nationalism in the six counties. Mr Fitt was elected the first leader of the party, with Mr Hume as his deputy. There followed the frightening and frustrating tumble of events which brought down the old Unionist provincial government at Stormont, the introduction of direct rule by London, and the first doomed attempt to set up a power-sharing devolved government. Mr Hume was tireless. His ponderous public style betrayed a quicksilver ability to analyse the issues, and a tireless capacity for dialogue. The power-sharing experiment collapsed and as the province seemed to slide towards an uncontainable civil war, Mr Hume scoured the wreckage, looking for pieces to rebuild into a coherent strategy. He played a leading role in the constitutional convention and other attempts to put some wheels back onto the wreckage of local politics. He also patrolled Dublin and London, lobbying and manoeuvering and nudging the British and Irish towards a new cooperative approach. In the mid-80s that process was well under way, but it seemed incapable of producing any lasting benefits to a province exhausted by 15 years of communal violence. Mr Hume, typically, thought through his analysis and came up with a radical new line. He decided that Sinn Fein, the political label used by the Provisional IRA, should be engaged in the political process. To that end, he set up a series of cloak-and-dagger meetings with Gerry Adams, a pivotal figure in both the political and paramilitary wings of the republican movement. When the Hume-Adams dialogue, as it was labelled, became public knowledge in 1993, there was a storm of protest. Much of it, predictably, came from unionists and loyalists scandalised by any dealings with republican \"terrorists\". But Mr Hume was also savagely attacked by members of his own party, who felt that in lending credibility to Sinn Fein, he was electorally sabotaging his own party. With typical tenacity, Mr Hume persevered in his confidence-building mission, and the wheels of negotiation began to turn. In the mid-90s came the important breakthrough of the IRA ceasefire; wobbly at first and still flawed, but holding nonetheless to this day. Anglo-Irish cooperation, together with US mediation, eventually produced the momentous agreement known as the Good Friday deal, allowing for power-sharing, new all-Ireland bodies and verification of paramilitary disarmament. It's shaky still, but it survives, resting on the foundations built very largely by Mr Hume. In 1998, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize jointly with the Unionist party leader David Trimble. Long before that, as a Euro-MP and as an inveterate builder of political deals, he had developed a great taste for international politics. From the outset of the Good Friday process, he eschewed any role in the provincial shenanigans of Belfast, preferring the wider stages of Dublin, London, Brussels and beyond.

      "body": "<p><a href=\"#A\">Background</a> | <a href=\"#B\">Jobs</a> | <a href=\"#C\">Living in Bangkok</a> | <a href=\"#D\">Thai Students</a> | <a href=\"#E\">In a Thai classroom</a> | <a href=\"#F\">Is Thailand for me?</a> | <a href=\"#G\">The future</a> | <a href=\"#H\">Useful websites</a></p> <p> <strong>Introduction</strong> </p> <p>You've seen the TV and print ads extolling the virtues of Thailand, 'The Land of Smiles', and Bangkok, 'The City of Angels'. But is life as an English teacher as idyllic as these slogans suggest? Well, I've been here for three and a half years so it can't be too bad. Hopefully the following article will equip you with enough basic information to ascertain whether you are ready for Thailand and whether Thailand is ready for you.</p> <p><strong><a name=\"A\">Background</a></strong></p> <p>Thailand has never been colonised, unlike most Southeast Asian countries. While Thais are justifiably proud of this fact, it does mean that there is not a long history of English teaching and, as a consequence, English teaching methodology has not developed over a long period of time. Indeed, in the majority of Thai schools and colleges, English is taught in the same manner as every other subject - by the rote learning method. </p> <p>The average student in Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines all have a much higher standard of English than their peers in Thailand. In an effort to correct this imbalance and make up lost ground on fellow ASEAN countries, the government has recently tried to introduce new leglislation to try to replace the old 'chalk and talk' teaching methods with more student-centred activities. While this idea is commendable, schools and individual teachers have been quick to point out obstacles rather than channelling their thoughts constructively. </p> <p>As with many good ideas, implementation is often delayed indefinitely and/or the original proposal/law altered beyond all recognition or scrapped entirely. From comments in the local press the Education Reform Bill 2000 appears, unfortunately, to be heading for oblivion. </p> <p><strong><a name=\"B\">Jobs</a></strong></p> <p>With respect to the availability of jobs in Thailand, teaching in Thailand equates to teaching in Bangkok. I'd estimate that over 90% of the foreign teachers working in Thailand are working in Bangkok. It's best to think of Bangkok and the rest of Thailand as two separate entities when it comes to teaching opportunities, salaries, job prospects, standard of living etc.</p> <p>If you have a notion of coming to Thailand, heading down to the beaches of Phuket or Samui or up to the hills in the North and getting a job teaching to finance your stay in paradise - forget it. Job vacancies and opportunities are very limited in these areas. It is possible to find work if you have the right connections but, if you're reading this and not already there doing the job, then you don't have the right connections. </p> <p>If you prefer the quieter life, then both Chiang Mai, in the north and Hat Yai in the south offer some possibilities - however the competition, particularly in Chiang Mai can be fierce, and the pay is often much lower than in Bangkok. </p> <p><strong><a name=\"C\">Living in Bangkok</a></strong></p> <p>First impressions of Bangkok? A sprawling, polluted, overcrowded city with one foot in the past and another, attempting to stride into the future. However, once you've been here a while you discover that the city does have quite a few redeeming qualities :</p> <p>\u0095 It's much safer than any western city - its very rare to hear of any muggings or see any fights in bars (the ones that do occur usually involve a well known politician's sons - but that's another story).</p> <p>\u0095 The friendly people - Thais are more willing than most to make you feel at home in their country. Their natural, relaxed lifestyle makes life here less hectic and stressful than, say, Japan, Taiwan or Hong Kong. </p> <p>\u0095 The cheap food - 20 to 30 baht (35 - 50 pence) will buy you a simple meal at a roadside food stall - of which there are thousands in Bangkok. Dining out is a way of life here - very few people cook their evening meal, preferring instead to either eat with their friends after work or buy something on the way home.</p> <p>\u0095 The Skytrain - the elevated electric railway opened in December 1999 and, although underused by Thais, is very popular amongst the teaching community. If you're lucky enough to live and teach on or near either of the two lines, your commuting time will be measured in minutes rather than hours.</p> <p>\u0095 The nightlife - one of the big attractions of Bangkok is its varied nightlife. For many teachers this is the deciding factor in the choice whether to come to Bangkok or go elsewhere. There's something for everyone from arty, stylish bars and bistros to the occasionally more dubious delights of the Patpong road and Nana Plaza. </p> <p>One final comment, from Phillip Williams, Academic Director at the Asia Institute of English, sums up life in the City of Angels: \"Bangkok is just about as teacher-friendly as a city can be. It offers a relatively low cost of living, affordable entertainment and, most importantly, teachers are always in great demand.\"</p> <p><strong><a name=\"D\">Thai students</a></strong></p> <p>The vast majority of Thai students have been taught by using the rote learning method. Anything the teacher writes on the board is automatically copied into your book. The information passes straight from the eye to the hand, bypassing the brain entirely. Students rarely question the teacher - that's tantamount to having doubts about the teacher's knowledge and, as we all know, what your teacher says is always correct. This results in the average Thai student being able to cope with a multiple choice exam, which requires the memorisation of facts, but having a great deal of difficulty with any exam that requires a written answer, especially one requiring a personal opinion or giving a reason why something happens.</p> <p>Historically the Thai people are farmers and the economy largely based on agriculture. During labour intensive periods, planting and harvest time, families will pool their resources to help their neighbours. Nowadays, the attitude on lending a helping hand is carried over into schools, colleges and the workplace. Weaker students are given a lot of encouragement (usually in the form of the correct answers) by their classmates. Teachers give students every opportunity to pass an exam, which manifests itself in the form of multiple retakes until the student passes. Co-workers help each other produce reports for their bosses to ensure that even those staff who would be considered a liability stay in a job. Therefore, if you are teaching a class, never expect Thai students to work on their own. Everything must be done in pairs or groups. If you specify that a certain report or piece of homework must be done individually, you could count on at least 70% still being done as a group effort.</p> <p>This may seem very negative about Thai students. Not so. It's as well to be aware of the differences between British students and Thai students. Knowing about these differences before you start teaching will save you a great deal of head shaking and hand wringing. On the plus side the students respect their teachers, and Thais are talkative, but you won't have any verbal or physical abuse from any students. As I mentioned earlier, your students will enjoy a laugh and a joke. They won't expect you to be serious.</p> <p><strong><a name=\"E\">In a Thai classroom</a></strong></p> <p>From an academic point of view, teaching ability isn't really valued or regarded as high as it should be. There are many well-qualified TEFL/ESL teachers who have left Thailand in despair, because their abilities aren't recognised by fellow Thai teachers and/or their students. Succeeding in Thailand isn't a matter of having a list of academic qualifications as long as your arm. What is important is that you can understand your students and know what they expect from you. For many career teachers, especially those used to teaching more dedicated students in, say, Japan, this aspect of Thai life can be particularly frustrating. </p> <p>Anyone who is governed by absolute obedience to rules and regulations, timetables, strict adherence to contracts, the need to be involved in decisions that affect you and the belief that displays of anger will get conflicts resolved will not enjoy their time here.</p> <p>Get used to 'going with the flow', 'rolling with it' and any number of other phrases that could be used to describe the notion that if something goes to plan then that's an unexpected bonus and not something to be taken for granted. Thai students want to be entertained as well as educated. Therefore the successful teacher has to bear in mind what I like to call the 4 Ss of Thai society. These are :</p> <p>\u0095 Sanook (fun). If it's not 'sanook', then why do it? Listening to a teacher drone on, copying from a board, mindless choral repetition etc aren't considered fun activities. First thing to remember then is to make your lessons fun, include a couple of games and keep things moving along. Don't get bogged down - it's not 'sanook'.</p> <p>\u0095 Suay (beautiful). All the best things in life are 'suay'. Outward appearance is of the utmost importance to Thais, especially personal appearance. Whilst teachers in the USA and Europe may be used to teaching classes in jeans and a t-shirt, that kind of attire is frowned upon here.

      "bodyText": "Background | Jobs | Living in Bangkok | Thai Students | In a Thai classroom | Is Thailand for me? | The future | Useful websites Introduction You've seen the TV and print ads extolling the virtues of Thailand, 'The Land of Smiles', and Bangkok, 'The City of Angels'. But is life as an English teacher as idyllic as these slogans suggest? Well, I've been here for three and a half years so it can't be too bad. Hopefully the following article will equip you with enough basic information to ascertain whether you are ready for Thailand and whether Thailand is ready for you. Background Thailand has never been colonised, unlike most Southeast Asian countries. While Thais are justifiably proud of this fact, it does mean that there is not a long history of English teaching and, as a consequence, English teaching methodology has not developed over a long period of time. Indeed, in the majority of Thai schools and colleges, English is taught in the same manner as every other subject - by the rote learning method. The average student in Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines all have a much higher standard of English than their peers in Thailand. In an effort to correct this imbalance and make up lost ground on fellow ASEAN countries, the government has recently tried to introduce new leglislation to try to replace the old 'chalk and talk' teaching methods with more student-centred activities. While this idea is commendable, schools and individual teachers have been quick to point out obstacles rather than channelling their thoughts constructively. As with many good ideas, implementation is often delayed indefinitely and/or the original proposal/law altered beyond all recognition or scrapped entirely. From comments in the local press the Education Reform Bill 2000 appears, unfortunately, to be heading for oblivion. Jobs With respect to the availability of jobs in Thailand, teaching in Thailand equates to teaching in Bangkok. I'd estimate that over 90% of the foreign teachers working in Thailand are working in Bangkok. It's best to think of Bangkok and the rest of Thailand as two separate entities when it comes to teaching opportunities, salaries, job prospects, standard of living etc. If you have a notion of coming to Thailand, heading down to the beaches of Phuket or Samui or up to the hills in the North and getting a job teaching to finance your stay in paradise - forget it. Job vacancies and opportunities are very limited in these areas. It is possible to find work if you have the right connections but, if you're reading this and not already there doing the job, then you don't have the right connections. If you prefer the quieter life, then both Chiang Mai, in the north and Hat Yai in the south offer some possibilities - however the competition, particularly in Chiang Mai can be fierce, and the pay is often much lower than in Bangkok. Living in Bangkok First impressions of Bangkok? A sprawling, polluted, overcrowded city with one foot in the past and another, attempting to stride into the future. However, once you've been here a while you discover that the city does have quite a few redeeming qualities : \u0095 It's much safer than any western city - its very rare to hear of any muggings or see any fights in bars (the ones that do occur usually involve a well known politician's sons - but that's another story). \u0095 The friendly people - Thais are more willing than most to make you feel at home in their country. Their natural, relaxed lifestyle makes life here less hectic and stressful than, say, Japan, Taiwan or Hong Kong. \u0095 The cheap food - 20 to 30 baht (35 - 50 pence) will buy you a simple meal at a roadside food stall - of which there are thousands in Bangkok. Dining out is a way of life here - very few people cook their evening meal, preferring instead to either eat with their friends after work or buy something on the way home. \u0095 The Skytrain - the elevated electric railway opened in December 1999 and, although underused by Thais, is very popular amongst the teaching community. If you're lucky enough to live and teach on or near either of the two lines, your commuting time will be measured in minutes rather than hours. \u0095 The nightlife - one of the big attractions of Bangkok is its varied nightlife. For many teachers this is the deciding factor in the choice whether to come to Bangkok or go elsewhere. There's something for everyone from arty, stylish bars and bistros to the occasionally more dubious delights of the Patpong road and Nana Plaza. One final comment, from Phillip Williams, Academic Director at the Asia Institute of English, sums up life in the City of Angels: \"Bangkok is just about as teacher-friendly as a city can be. It offers a relatively low cost of living, affordable entertainment and, most importantly, teachers are always in great demand.\" Thai students The vast majority of Thai students have been taught by using the rote learning method. Anything the teacher writes on the board is automatically copied into your book. The information passes straight from the eye to the hand, bypassing the brain entirely. Students rarely question the teacher - that's tantamount to having doubts about the teacher's knowledge and, as we all know, what your teacher says is always correct. This results in the average Thai student being able to cope with a multiple choice exam, which requires the memorisation of facts, but having a great deal of difficulty with any exam that requires a written answer, especially one requiring a personal opinion or giving a reason why something happens. Historically the Thai people are farmers and the economy largely based on agriculture. During labour intensive periods, planting and harvest time, families will pool their resources to help their neighbours. Nowadays, the attitude on lending a helping hand is carried over into schools, colleges and the workplace. Weaker students are given a lot of encouragement (usually in the form of the correct answers) by their classmates. Teachers give students every opportunity to pass an exam, which manifests itself in the form of multiple retakes until the student passes. Co-workers help each other produce reports for their bosses to ensure that even those staff who would be considered a liability stay in a job. Therefore, if you are teaching a class, never expect Thai students to work on their own. Everything must be done in pairs or groups. If you specify that a certain report or piece of homework must be done individually, you could count on at least 70% still being done as a group effort. This may seem very negative about Thai students. Not so. It's as well to be aware of the differences between British students and Thai students. Knowing about these differences before you start teaching will save you a great deal of head shaking and hand wringing. On the plus side the students respect their teachers, and Thais are talkative, but you won't have any verbal or physical abuse from any students. As I mentioned earlier, your students will enjoy a laugh and a joke. They won't expect you to be serious. In a Thai classroom From an academic point of view, teaching ability isn't really valued or regarded as high as it should be. There are many well-qualified TEFL/ESL teachers who have left Thailand in despair, because their abilities aren't recognised by fellow Thai teachers and/or their students. Succeeding in Thailand isn't a matter of having a list of academic qualifications as long as your arm. What is important is that you can understand your students and know what they expect from you. For many career teachers, especially those used to teaching more dedicated students in, say, Japan, this aspect of Thai life can be particularly frustrating. Anyone who is governed by absolute obedience to rules and regulations, timetables, strict adherence to contracts, the need to be involved in decisions that affect you and the belief that displays of anger will get conflicts resolved will not enjoy their time here. Get used to 'going with the flow', 'rolling with it' and any number of other phrases that could be used to describe the notion that if something goes to plan then that's an unexpected bonus and not something to be taken for granted. Thai students want to be entertained as well as educated. Therefore the successful teacher has to bear in mind what I like to call the 4 Ss of Thai society. These are : \u0095 Sanook (fun). If it's not 'sanook', then why do it? Listening to a teacher drone on, copying from a board, mindless choral repetition etc aren't considered fun activities. First thing to remember then is to make your lessons fun, include a couple of games and keep things moving along. Don't get bogged down - it's not 'sanook'. \u0095 Suay (beautiful). All the best things in life are 'suay'. Outward appearance is of the utmost importance to Thais, especially personal appearance. Whilst teachers in the USA and Europe may be used to teaching classes in jeans and a t-shirt, that kind of attire is frowned upon here. Get a hair cut, and you'll need to wear a shirt, tie, trousers and polished shoes. Female teachers should stick to knee length skirts and non-revealing blouses. 'Suay' carries over into any homework/reports you'll give your students. Style is always placed above substance. Trying to convince your students otherwise will result in a look of disbelief upon their faces. \u0095 'Suparb' (politeness). This covers everything from the way you dress and speak to having respect for your elders. Everyone knows their place in the social structure and addresses each other accordingly. Elders are addressed as 'Pee', those younger than yourself as 'Nong'. Elders, bosses, teachers and monks are all 'wai'd' (the traditional Thai greeting - hold your hands as though praying and bow your head slightly). This is just the tip of the politeness iceberg. A couple of things for teachers new to Thailand to remember are - never to perch on the edge of a desk (as I remember my old high school maths teacher doing every lesson) and don't touch your students, especially if you're a male teacher and have female students. \u0095 'Serious'.

      "bodyText": "The Oxford college which rejected the state school student Laura Spence is looking unfavourably on an application from another aspiring, but considerably richer, teenager. The university has said an application from Prince Azim, 18, the son of the Sultan of Brunei, who is the world's third richest man, for a place to read law at Magdalen college is likely to be rejected because it does not believe that he is sufficiently qualified. Downing Street fiercely denied a newspaper report yesterday that the government had asked Magdalen to accept the prince. A Foreign Office spokesman said the royal family of Brunei had sent the prince's application to the department, and officials had forwarded it to Oxford. But the spokesman said: \"We didn't seek to influence the outcome of the application in any way. \"The Foreign Office did speak to Oxford university when the application was sent. Oxford explained that the application was not likely to be successful. They looked through the papers and decided he was unlikely to fulfil their entry requirement.\" According to the Sunday Express, a former college member working at the Foreign Office had followed up by telephoning to tell the officials at Magdalen that the prime minister, Tony Blair, was \"personally concerned\" with the outcome of the application because he was anxious about relations with Brunei. But a Downing Street spokesman said: \"The suggestion that the government in any way would seek to influence Magdalen's decision on the application is completely and utterly wrong.\" The spokesman could not say whether the prime minister knew of the application by the prince, who is keen to follow in the footsteps of his brother, crown prince Al-Nuhtadee Billah, 24, heir to the Brunei throne, who studied at Oxford. A final decision on the application has yet to be made. The prince, currently studying in Singapore, is a music fan and has been to see the television show Top of the Pops recorded in Britain. Magdalen's president, Anthony Smith, led the counter-attack against the chancellor, Gordon Brown, after he accused the college of being elitist in refusing a place to Ms Spence, who applied to read medicine. Mr Smith, who is known to be furious about the story, referred all calls to the university press office yesterday. \"We don't talk about individual applications. All applications are assessed on their individual merits,\" a spokesman for Oxford said.",

These range from agreeing protocols for primary care and the specialist management of mental illness by April 2001 to getting rid of mixed-sex wards from 95% of health authorities and providing an extra 300 secure beds by April 2002. </p> <p>The new duty of partnership, placed on health and local authorities by the Health Act 1999, provides for pooled budgets and integrated provision and commissioning. Targets will only be achieved through better cooperation between all parties, including the independent sector and user-led organisations. </p> <p>Practical support will come from the national mental health implementation group, led by the Department of Health and supported by a national implementation team. The NHS mental health modernisation funds will provide \u00a35m to help teams implement the NSF at local level. Assistance will also be provided for organisational and professional development across the NHS and social care.</p> <p>The five national underpinning programmes - finance; workforce planning, education and training; research and development; clinical decision support systems; and information strategy - will all support implementation. They will also help to adapt milestones in response to need and progress - under the lead of the national mental health implementation group - and play a strong part in ensuring that good practice is shared. The developing NHS learning network, the National Institute for Social Work's electronic library and a national database of NHS service delivery and practice will all help here, too.</p> <p><strong>How will it be assessed?</strong><br>It is already acknowledged that too many indicators might overburden services, diverting resources from patient care. However, social services, the NHS and their joint initiatives will all be monitored.</p> <p>Performance assessment frameworks (PAFs) for the NHS and the personal social services will be used to monitor implementation. PAFs are based on principles of best value. Since April, this duty has underpinned all local government services. Each local authority will publish best value plans annually.</p> <p> The commission for health improvement, the social services inspectorate and the audit commission will also keep tabs on each NSF. </p> <p>NHS and social services joint working is vital to the success of the NSF. This is most likely to be reflected by general progress, but it will also assessed by \"interface indicators\" built into performance assessment frameworks for both the NHS and the social services. For the time being, these will specifically monitor emergency psychiatric readmission rates, to get an idea of the efficiency of care planning and alternatives to hospital.</p> <p>Plans are also afoot to establish \"high-level performance indicators\" within the PAFs. These relatively quick assessments, in use from April 2001, will look at input, process and outcome - what resources are going in, what they are used for and whether they are having the desired effect.</p> <p><strong>What is the role of the workforce action team? </strong><br>The multidisciplinary team began work in December 1999, its interim report was published in September and its final report is due in spring 2001. It is looking at developing the workforce in order to implement the NSF and, to date, many of its recommendations mirror those of the Department of Health's recent consultation document. </p> <p>The roles of staff working across mental health - and their interaction with one another - are extremely complex. The action team's key message stresses the need to promote flexibility and innovation in workforce planning, education and training. </p> <p>The action team has also welcomed various sums of money, allocated for specific purposes:<br>\u0095 \u00a31m to support training of community psychiatric nurses and community nurses in mental health<br>\u0095 \u00a32m to support clinical psychology training in 2000-01<br>\u0095 \u00a32.5m for psychiatry training, increasing consultant numbers by 230 by 2007<br>\u0095 \u00a33.9m to boost social work training<br>\u0095 \u00a34m for mental health nurses in 2000-01</p>",

The NHS mental health modernisation funds will provide \u00a35m to help teams implement the NSF at local level. Assistance will also be provided for organisational and professional development across the NHS and social care. The five national underpinning programmes - finance; workforce planning, education and training; research and development; clinical decision support systems; and information strategy - will all support implementation. They will also help to adapt milestones in response to need and progress - under the lead of the national mental health implementation group - and play a strong part in ensuring that good practice is shared. The developing NHS learning network, the National Institute for Social Work's electronic library and a national database of NHS service delivery and practice will all help here, too. How will it be assessed? It is already acknowledged that too many indicators might overburden services, diverting resources from patient care. However, social services, the NHS and their joint initiatives will all be monitored. Performance assessment frameworks (PAFs) for the NHS and the personal social services will be used to monitor implementation. PAFs are based on principles of best value. Since April, this duty has underpinned all local government services. Each local authority will publish best value plans annually. The commission for health improvement, the social services inspectorate and the audit commission will also keep tabs on each NSF. NHS and social services joint working is vital to the success of the NSF. This is most likely to be reflected by general progress, but it will also assessed by \"interface indicators\" built into performance assessment frameworks for both the NHS and the social services. For the time being, these will specifically monitor emergency psychiatric readmission rates, to get an idea of the efficiency of care planning and alternatives to hospital. Plans are also afoot to establish \"high-level performance indicators\" within the PAFs. These relatively quick assessments, in use from April 2001, will look at input, process and outcome - what resources are going in, what they are used for and whether they are having the desired effect. What is the role of the workforce action team? The multidisciplinary team began work in December 1999, its interim report was published in September and its final report is due in spring 2001. It is looking at developing the workforce in order to implement the NSF and, to date, many of its recommendations mirror those of the Department of Health's recent consultation document. The roles of staff working across mental health - and their interaction with one another - are extremely complex. The action team's key message stresses the need to promote flexibility and innovation in workforce planning, education and training. The action team has also welcomed various sums of money, allocated for specific purposes: \u0095 \u00a31m to support training of community psychiatric nurses and community nurses in mental health \u0095 \u00a32m to support clinical psychology training in 2000-01 \u0095 \u00a32.5m for psychiatry training, increasing consultant numbers by 230 by 2007 \u0095 \u00a33.9m to boost social work training \u0095 \u00a34m for mental health nurses in 2000-01",

John Cannan is being quizzed by detectives at a police station in London on suspicion of kidnapping and murdering the 25-year-old. Ms Lamplugh vanished after going to show a property to a man called \"Mr Kipper\" in Fulham, south-west London, in 1986. Her body has never been recovered despite reports that she may have been buried under an army barracks in Norton, Worcestershire. Several suspects have been questioned in the last 14 years. A 1995 book by crime writer Christopher Berry-Dee claimed that Michael Sams, who murdered prostitute Julie Dart and kidnapped property consultant Stephanie Slater, killed Ms Lamplugh, but the theory was discounted by police. Five months after her daughter's disappearance, Diana Lamplugh founded the Suzy Lamplugh Trust to campaign for better protection for young people against sexual and other violence. The trust campaigns to educate working women and others on how to avoid becoming crime victims. Suzy Lamplugh was officially declared dead in 1994.

After more than three years of harrying Labour and organising nationwide protests including the countryside march in London and demonstrations outside party conferences, leaders have privately admitted that they will have to accept the will of parliament if there is a vote to ban fox-hunting. Confidential minutes obtained by the Guardian of a private dinner held last week with eight Labour backbench MPs reveal that the organisers were prepared to \"roll over\" to government ministers on the issue in return for millions of pounds of new investment in rural Britain. They even welched on their strongest supporters - the farmers - by backing the phasing out of billions of pounds of European Union subsidies in return for new investment in farming. The revelations could cause a split within the alliance as other leading figures are likely to reject these concessions. Leaders of the alliance at the meeting praised Michael Meacher, the environment minister, for \"a full grasp of the crisis\" affecting rural Britain. They also apologised to Labour MPs for using offensive posters attacking the agriculture minister, Nick Brown, during demonstrations outside the last two party conferences. Richard Sturge, chief executive of the Countryside Alliance, is minuted as saying that after meeting Mr Meacher he realised \"Labour and the CA had more in common\" than expected. The minutes also record that Mr Sturge was \"surprised and pleased that the prime minister devoted an hour and a half to a meeting with a group of countryside leaders\" that morning in connection with the rural white paper. The meeting was hosted by Helen Brinton, Labour MP for Peterborough, who \"had been working for many months to find the common ground between Labour and the Countryside Alliance\". Seven other Labour MPs attended - Diana Organ, MP for the Forest of Dean; Bob Laxton, Derby North; David Kidney, Stafford; Christine Russell, Chester; Jane Griffiths, Reading East; David Lepper, Brighton Pavilion; and Mark Todd, Derbyshire South. The Countryside Alliance was represented by Mr Burge, Alan Armstrong, its deputy chief executive, Maurice Askew, a board member, and Phil Royal, an adviser. The minutes record Mr Burge as a member of the Labour party and Mr Askew as \"a substantial member in South Yorkshire [who] owns his own printing company\". Mr Sturge is quoted as saying that the government's rural white paper was \"very, very good indeed...highly ambitious\". He said that the aim of the alliance was \"not to bring the government down...rural people area are a minority ...we seek to influence only...minorities required to influence majorities\". Later, Mr Armstrong told the MPs that, on the hunting issue, they would \"accept the view of parliament but would like an informed debate\". He added that the Countryside Alliance march on London, scheduled for March 18 next year, would go ahead. \"It was unrealistic to pull it,\" he said. Mr Sturge had told MPs of his \"deep regret\" with regard to \"the offensive posters about Nick Brown\". He explained that the poster stewards had failed on that occasion, and affirmed that the vetting of posters would be strengthened. He hoped and expected \"never to see the like again\". Ms Griffiths was told by Mr Sturge that the alliance's solicitors had forced a British National party fuel protest website to drop its cyber link to the group. Last night, one of the MPs present at the meeting, Mr Kidney, confirmed that the minutes were an accurate account. After the Guardian read them to him, he said: \"I had no idea that minutes were being taken - unless someone was hiding under the table - but they are very accurate, even down to my colleague Mark Todd turning up late. I'd love to know what they're saying to the Tories.\" Anti-hunting groups were delighted about the comments made by alliance organisers in the minutes.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Last Friday the Commission for Racial Equality unleashed its latest salvo in the battle to eradicate racism from British society. The race-relations watchdog launched a new 60-second TV commercial on Channel 4 starring a range of top-flight celebrities, from Lennox Lewis to Chris Evans, Scary Spice and even Ken Livingstone, all made (via a combination of make-up and special effects) to look as though they have different coloured skin. </p> <p>Thus Lewis and Scary Spice appear as white people, Evans is black and Livingstone is transformed into an Asian. \"Would you think differently about me ... if I was white?\" challenges Lewis at the beginning, as his familiar features visibly, well, blanch, while Livingstone goes on, \"Would I have won if I was Asian?\" and Evans chirrups: \"Would I be more annoying?\" </p> <p>The startling film, created by Euro RSCG Wnek Gosper and produced by RSA Films, ends with the provocative line: \"The only thing we need to change is the way we think.\" </p> <p>But as this commercial is busily garnering spin-off media coverage and triggering debate about racial prejudice in British homes and pubs, it also serves as an opportunity to re-examine racism within adland itself. </p> <p>To be blunt, there is still a striking lack of ethnic minorities both employed in the ad industry and represented in adverts and commercials generally. The number of non-whites working in the industry is minimal, and those that do are far from senior. There is no official data available - the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising's annual census records sex and not ethnic origin - but agency estimates suggest that black people, Asians and other minorities represent less than 1% of those employed in the business. </p> <p>Kai-Lu Hsiung, the producer of the CRE spot at RSA Films (who happens to be half-Chinese, half-English), says: \"When we shot the ad it made us really think about the lack of minorities in the industry.

      "bodyText": "Last Friday the Commission for Racial Equality unleashed its latest salvo in the battle to eradicate racism from British society. The race-relations watchdog launched a new 60-second TV commercial on Channel 4 starring a range of top-flight celebrities, from Lennox Lewis to Chris Evans, Scary Spice and even Ken Livingstone, all made (via a combination of make-up and special effects) to look as though they have different coloured skin. Thus Lewis and Scary Spice appear as white people, Evans is black and Livingstone is transformed into an Asian. \"Would you think differently about me ... if I was white?\" challenges Lewis at the beginning, as his familiar features visibly, well, blanch, while Livingstone goes on, \"Would I have won if I was Asian?\" and Evans chirrups: \"Would I be more annoying?\" The startling film, created by Euro RSCG Wnek Gosper and produced by RSA Films, ends with the provocative line: \"The only thing we need to change is the way we think.\" But as this commercial is busily garnering spin-off media coverage and triggering debate about racial prejudice in British homes and pubs, it also serves as an opportunity to re-examine racism within adland itself. To be blunt, there is still a striking lack of ethnic minorities both employed in the ad industry and represented in adverts and commercials generally. The number of non-whites working in the industry is minimal, and those that do are far from senior. There is no official data available - the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising's annual census records sex and not ethnic origin - but agency estimates suggest that black people, Asians and other minorities represent less than 1% of those employed in the business. Kai-Lu Hsiung, the producer of the CRE spot at RSA Films (who happens to be half-Chinese, half-English), says: \"When we shot the ad it made us really think about the lack of minorities in the industry. Crews are predominantly white. We actually used a black make-up artist, a black sound woman and a black runner, but they were just three out of a total of 140 crew members - we couldn't have got 140 ethnic minority people even if we had tried.\" When challenged on their employment mix, most agencies and production companies rather lamely insist that they do indeed have \"one black copywriter\" or \"a black runner\".

Instead, it was about government presentation - and public perception - of health policy. It was also about countering the toxic blasts that will emanate from the media on \"the state of the NHS\" in the next few weeks.</p> <p>Blair knows that however successful any number of essential, but low-profile, modernisation initiatives to improve services such as mental health might be, it is the view from casualty, as reported by the media, that most people will use as an index of NHS health.</p> <p>Hence his plea: \"Let's not continue the nonsense of saying the NHS is 'on its knees' or in 'crisis' every time a mistake happens. Of course it is terrible for that person. But those who believe in the NHS should not let individual cases be used as a battering ram, by those who do not believe in the NHS, and want to see it dismantled.\"</p> <p>The message was aimed in part, we can surmise, in the general direction of the Daily Mail and its political allies, purveyors of \"NHS in crisis\" headlines to middle England, and notoriously loathe to pass up an opportunity to knock the health service. As the Power 90 survey by SocietyGuardian.co.uk revealed, not for nothing is the Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre regarded as the 10th most powerful and influential person in the health service. His paper's NHS headlines, it is said, cause shock waves across Whitehall.</p> <p>With a general election just around the corner, and Tony Blair's credibility tied firmly to the success of his very personal crusade to improve the health service, \"a good winter\" for the NHS is politically essential.</p> <p>Bad NHS winters come and go - last year was a bad one, and the government was on the skids for a while. It was saved, dramatically, by Tony Blair's stunning pledge to invest billions more in the health service. The move knocked out his critics for a while, but the extra billions won't make an immediate difference to the structural causes of the winter crisis - lack of nurses and shortage of beds - and yet the public will have high expectations of big improvements.</p> <p>Blair hopes that his speech will dampen public expectations of what the NHS can deliver, and outflank the Daily Mail. Not a lot to do with health \"on the ground\", but that's politics.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair's speech on winter pressures today revealed nothing new in policy or strategy terms; it was a pre-emptive strike, a signal that the government will not be caught napping on the NHS as it was over September's fuel protests. Health policy was not really at the heart of this speech. Instead, it was about government presentation - and public perception - of health policy. It was also about countering the toxic blasts that will emanate from the media on \"the state of the NHS\" in the next few weeks. Blair knows that however successful any number of essential, but low-profile, modernisation initiatives to improve services such as mental health might be, it is the view from casualty, as reported by the media, that most people will use as an index of NHS health. Hence his plea: \"Let's not continue the nonsense of saying the NHS is 'on its knees' or in 'crisis' every time a mistake happens. Of course it is terrible for that person. But those who believe in the NHS should not let individual cases be used as a battering ram, by those who do not believe in the NHS, and want to see it dismantled.\" The message was aimed in part, we can surmise, in the general direction of the Daily Mail and its political allies, purveyors of \"NHS in crisis\" headlines to middle England, and notoriously loathe to pass up an opportunity to knock the health service. As the Power 90 survey by SocietyGuardian.co.uk revealed, not for nothing is the Daily Mail editor Paul Dacre regarded as the 10th most powerful and influential person in the health service. His paper's NHS headlines, it is said, cause shock waves across Whitehall. With a general election just around the corner, and Tony Blair's credibility tied firmly to the success of his very personal crusade to improve the health service, \"a good winter\" for the NHS is politically essential. Bad NHS winters come and go - last year was a bad one, and the government was on the skids for a while. It was saved, dramatically, by Tony Blair's stunning pledge to invest billions more in the health service. The move knocked out his critics for a while, but the extra billions won't make an immediate difference to the structural causes of the winter crisis - lack of nurses and shortage of beds - and yet the public will have high expectations of big improvements. Blair hopes that his speech will dampen public expectations of what the NHS can deliver, and outflank the Daily Mail. Not a lot to do with health \"on the ground\", but that's politics.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>VEN WILL I BE FAMOUS?</strong></p> <p>So there's a press conference being held at Middlesbrough's training ground at 4.30pm this afternoon. As the Fiver will be slumped under a table at our local lapdancery by that hour, we are left to have a quick guess at what it's about. Could it be that Bryan Robbo has carried out a bloodless coup, ousting Steve Gibbo and seizing control of Boro for his own ruthless ends? Perhaps the club have finally completed the signing of Ally McCoist. Or perhaps they've cobbled together some hotch-potch deal to get Terry Venables to spend six months in the north-east.</p> <p>Obviously, the last time we left it, Boro had stood firm (hem hem) and, despite spending days looking for some sort of compromise from Venables, announced they could accept no compromise and that any deal was dead. Then Robbo announced that, with Venables out of the way, there was nobody else in the world good enough to replace him. Then a toothless Boro lost 1-0 to West Ham. Then Venables made some conciliatory noises through his friends in the press, and before you know it Boro are tearing down the A1 for more talks - as if the thought of Robbo remaining in charge scared them witless.</p> <p>\"I would put the club in front of any individual,\" Gibbo said today. \"If somebody needs to be sacrificed - it doesn't matter whether it is me or anyone else - that sacrifice will be made.\" Tough words, but it does sound awfully like Boro have capitulated and accepted whatever offer Venables was prepared to give them. \"I said to Bryan Robson, 'I will take it to the end of the year'\", Tel revealed. \"'You have a break for six months. I'll deal with the press and the team.'\" What a nice man. But remember, if Tel doesn't take the job this afternoon, and Gary Pallister announces a revolutionary new orthopaedic treatment instead - you heard it here first.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>THE FIVER'S INTERACTIVE ADVENT CALENDAR</strong></p> <p>Dec 2: <a href=\"http://www.footballunlimited.co.uk/News_Story/0,1563,406745,00.html\">click here</a></p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>LENNON VS LENNON</strong></p> <p>It was twenty years ago next Friday that John Lennon was gunned down by a deranged fan outside the Dakota building. Spooky huh? But it gets weirder. Because if, by next Friday, Neil Lennon hasn't shot off up north to join a deranged manager outside the Parkhead building in Glasgow for \u00a320,000-a-week, then the Fiver's a Wings fan.</p> <p>Yes, the Northern Ireland international whose life has eerily echoed that of his namesake - they both changed their hairstyle, they have both been to Liverpool, not to mention spending three months in bed with long hair doing psychoactive drugs with bonkers Japanese women (probably) - is likely to join his mental mentor, Martin O'Neill, at Celtic. Lennon announced after Leicester's 3-1 win over Leeds on Saturday that it would be his last game as a Fox, adding: \"You have to be Irish to understand the pull of Celtic.\" Which doesn't say much for the Scots.</p> <p>No deal has been struck just yet, because the Foxy Foxes are holding out for more money than Celtic have been prepared to offer so far (Lennon's old club Crewe stand to earn a percentage of any transfer fee). But with Peter Taylor imposing a deadline of 5pm tomorrow for any improved bid, you wouldn't bet against something happening soon. \"This has dragged on for too long,\" Taylor said today, although he said he understood why Lennon would want to play for Celtic. \"It has always been his dream,\" he said. Whether it was dream number nine remains to be seen.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"I was in defence as much as in attack. I was always coming back to mark Steven Pressley. For me the tempo of the game was far too high. That's why it wasn't a good football game\" - Welcome to Scotland, Rangers' \u00a312m striker Tore Andre Flo.</p> <p>* * * * * * * * * * * * *</p> <p><strong>THE NAME'S TAYLOR, PETER TAYLOR</strong></p> <p>The world of international club football is a world of intrigue and secret machinations. Sure as eggs which are actually hand grenades is eggs, you can be sure that the really successful managers are up to no good. They're all spies, y'see. So it's just as well the in-no-way-paranoid Fiver is on the ball: we've got our hands on a secret report which reveals that England caretaker-manager Peter Taylor has been plotting the downfall of Leeds with Lazio boss Sven-Goran Eriksson ahead of tomorrow's Big Cup tie.</p> <p>\"To say I have helped Sven in providing information about Leeds is totally wrong,\" insisted Taylor as he sipped on a suspiciously shaken martini. \"Nothing, in fact, could be further from the truth,\" the square-jawed Leicester boss continued. \"When I went to Rome last week to see Sven I did say to him that Leeds United are a very good team. But that was the extent of our conversations as regards Leeds United.\"</p> <p>And that's supposed to convince us? You're probably wearing a tux under that tatty tracksuit, for a start. \"I was there to talk to him purely about England matters and nothing else,\" Taylor insisted. \"Nothing was said about Leeds.

      "bodyText": "VEN WILL I BE FAMOUS? So there's a press conference being held at Middlesbrough's training ground at 4.30pm this afternoon. As the Fiver will be slumped under a table at our local lapdancery by that hour, we are left to have a quick guess at what it's about. Could it be that Bryan Robbo has carried out a bloodless coup, ousting Steve Gibbo and seizing control of Boro for his own ruthless ends? Perhaps the club have finally completed the signing of Ally McCoist. Or perhaps they've cobbled together some hotch-potch deal to get Terry Venables to spend six months in the north-east. Obviously, the last time we left it, Boro had stood firm (hem hem) and, despite spending days looking for some sort of compromise from Venables, announced they could accept no compromise and that any deal was dead. Then Robbo announced that, with Venables out of the way, there was nobody else in the world good enough to replace him. Then a toothless Boro lost 1-0 to West Ham. Then Venables made some conciliatory noises through his friends in the press, and before you know it Boro are tearing down the A1 for more talks - as if the thought of Robbo remaining in charge scared them witless. \"I would put the club in front of any individual,\" Gibbo said today. \"If somebody needs to be sacrificed - it doesn't matter whether it is me or anyone else - that sacrifice will be made.\" Tough words, but it does sound awfully like Boro have capitulated and accepted whatever offer Venables was prepared to give them. \"I said to Bryan Robson, 'I will take it to the end of the year'\", Tel revealed. \"'You have a break for six months. I'll deal with the press and the team.'\" What a nice man. But remember, if Tel doesn't take the job this afternoon, and Gary Pallister announces a revolutionary new orthopaedic treatment instead - you heard it here first. * * * * * * * * * * * * * THE FIVER'S INTERACTIVE ADVENT CALENDAR Dec 2: click here * * * * * * * * * * * * * LENNON VS LENNON It was twenty years ago next Friday that John Lennon was gunned down by a deranged fan outside the Dakota building. Spooky huh? But it gets weirder. Because if, by next Friday, Neil Lennon hasn't shot off up north to join a deranged manager outside the Parkhead building in Glasgow for \u00a320,000-a-week, then the Fiver's a Wings fan. Yes, the Northern Ireland international whose life has eerily echoed that of his namesake - they both changed their hairstyle, they have both been to Liverpool, not to mention spending three months in bed with long hair doing psychoactive drugs with bonkers Japanese women (probably) - is likely to join his mental mentor, Martin O'Neill, at Celtic. Lennon announced after Leicester's 3-1 win over Leeds on Saturday that it would be his last game as a Fox, adding: \"You have to be Irish to understand the pull of Celtic.\" Which doesn't say much for the Scots. No deal has been struck just yet, because the Foxy Foxes are holding out for more money than Celtic have been prepared to offer so far (Lennon's old club Crewe stand to earn a percentage of any transfer fee). But with Peter Taylor imposing a deadline of 5pm tomorrow for any improved bid, you wouldn't bet against something happening soon. \"This has dragged on for too long,\" Taylor said today, although he said he understood why Lennon would want to play for Celtic. \"It has always been his dream,\" he said. Whether it was dream number nine remains to be seen. * * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"I was in defence as much as in attack. I was always coming back to mark Steven Pressley. For me the tempo of the game was far too high. That's why it wasn't a good football game\" - Welcome to Scotland, Rangers' \u00a312m striker Tore Andre Flo. * * * * * * * * * * * * * THE NAME'S TAYLOR, PETER TAYLOR The world of international club football is a world of intrigue and secret machinations. Sure as eggs which are actually hand grenades is eggs, you can be sure that the really successful managers are up to no good. They're all spies, y'see. So it's just as well the in-no-way-paranoid Fiver is on the ball: we've got our hands on a secret report which reveals that England caretaker-manager Peter Taylor has been plotting the downfall of Leeds with Lazio boss Sven-Goran Eriksson ahead of tomorrow's Big Cup tie. \"To say I have helped Sven in providing information about Leeds is totally wrong,\" insisted Taylor as he sipped on a suspiciously shaken martini. \"Nothing, in fact, could be further from the truth,\" the square-jawed Leicester boss continued. \"When I went to Rome last week to see Sven I did say to him that Leeds United are a very good team. But that was the extent of our conversations as regards Leeds United.\" And that's supposed to convince us? You're probably wearing a tux under that tatty tracksuit, for a start. \"I was there to talk to him purely about England matters and nothing else,\" Taylor insisted. \"Nothing was said about Leeds. It is an understatement to say that I am annoyed about what has been suggested,\" the ruggedly handsome superhero concluded, before asking us if we wanted to slip into something more comfortable. * * * * * * * * * * * * * THE RUMOUR MILL Middlesbrough striker Alun Armstrong is in talks with Ipswich after the two sides agreed an \u00a3800,000 fee. The former Stockport striker has failed to make an impression since joining the club for \u00a31.5m in 1998. Benni McCarthy wants to complete a move to Aston Villa this week. \"Benni has told me that he thinks this is the week it either gets done or is finally killed off\", his agent Rob Moore said today. \"He is still convinced he will be a Villa player, but it is disconcerting that Villa are being linked with names left, right and centre.\" Manchester City have had a \u00a36m bid for Eidur Gudjohnsen rejected by Chelsea. * * * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF Rangers have signed 20-year-old Finnish midfielder Jani Kauppila on a two-year deal. A documentary about Ajax will not be screened in certain Dutch cinemas after threats from rival soccer fans. Ajax, daar hoorden zij engelen zingen - Ajax, they heard angels singing there - was to have been shown in The Hague and Utrecht, but cinema managers caved in to threats from Feyenoord and Utrecht fans who demanded the film be removed. * * * * * * * * * * * * * TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO ITV: Big Cup Special (11.30pm) Only to the teams who are in it.

You will recall Mondeo Man, who played such a crucial role in Tony Blair's rise to power. Mondeo Man was the disenchanted, lower middle class professional, targeted by vote-chasers before the last general election, who could be nudged to set aside the habit of a lifetime and vote Labour. </p> <p>These days, for better or worse, the Mondeo's reputation inevitably precedes it. It is the only vehicle - apart from a tank - that has overturned a government. </p> <p>You don't, however, tend to hear much about Mondeo Man these days. He appears to have withdrawn quietly into his house, appearing only briefly on his drive to wax his car. For all we know, he may be having fond thoughts about William Hague by now. It's even possible that he's driving a Vauxhall Vectra. </p> <p>You hear a little less about the Mondeo, too, and, unless the newly released models go well, historians may eventually conclude that the car enjoyed its golden age in the mid-90s. In 1994 and 1995, the second and third years of the Mondeo's life, during which it reigned as Europe's Car of the Year, it accounted impressively for almost a quarter of British sales in its very crowded sector. </p> <p>Since then there has been, inevitably, a fall-off: last year the Mondeo had a 15.3% share of the market. Nevertheless, there are more than 750,000 Mondeos on British roads. It remains a hit, even as a sleeper. And now here comes a remix, looking to stoke up the interest levels and get the punters dancing the way they did in the glory days. </p> <p>Here are some of the key features of the new Mondeo: more airbags; stronger, safer brakes; snazzier headlamps; and increased legroom for passengers in the back. I'm not sure how much there is on that list to set one's heart fluttering, but the Mondeo is equipped with a new family of Ford engines that might work a little harder to entertain you. </p> <p>On the other hand, being Fords, they might not. I can only report that the Duratec HE 1.8 in the car I drove rendered it quick enough to get your jacket flapping on the hanger in the back. </p> <p>But whatever the tempting extras, for the unconverted there will be the usual prejudices to overcome, not just about the Mondeo label but about the whole Ford brand. </p> <p>Say \"Ford\" and a whole crop of unfortunate associations comes wriggling to the surface, including: the firm's association with cut-price fleet cars (and, by extension, its association with chippy, middle-ranking sales executives with their jackets flapping on hangers in the back); the fact that it once produced the Capri and still produces the Fiesta; the erosion, in Britain, of the company's lustrous historical connection with the pioneering Henry and, in place of that, its somehow significant association with Dagenham (which houses its plant) and Brentwood (which houses its offices). </p> <p>Before Mondeo Man there was Essex Man, and his spirit appears to breathe deeply wherever Ford cars are owned and driven. </p> <p>But over and above these general, abstract and, in some cases, plainly ungenerous feelings, there is also the fact that Ford has produced some of the most sleep-inducing cars ever to leave a factory, and has placed within them some of the most taste-challenging plastic interiors since the launch of Barbie's first house. </p> <p>The Mondeo does not deserve to be gathered in with this history. This is a new-era Ford - a Ford from the age of the Focus and the Ka, stylised vehicles from somewhere way out to the left of Ford's traditionally bland remit. That said, the Mondeo has a less colourful market in mind, and car designers understand that you can reinvent neither the wheel nor the sales executive. Accordingly, the new Mondeo seems carefully conceived not to startle its constituency. </p> <p>It appears to have turned for inspiration and succour to the VW Passat. The Passat may not be the most sense-awakening car in the world but, being built by VW, its furniture tends at least to feel reassuringly weighty and firm. The Mondeo follows its cue. The indicator and windscreen-wiper stalks, for instance, don't - as they do in older Fords - feel like the boom on a balsawood model of a yacht. </p> <p>Even the plastic fascia on the dashboard doesn't seem quite so overwhelmingly plasticky as one expects from Ford. Interestingly, the plastic on the driver's side is differently stippled from the plastic on the passenger's side. Two different kinds of fascia grain! Now there's a unique selling point, and one strangely underplayed in the car's advertising. </p> <p>Overall, the interior is modestly stylish - a quiet advance on its predecessor. Only two things leap out: the oval clock makes the whole central panel look like an in-car Teasmade; and does that irritating \"boing\" noise have to accompany the winking of the indicators? In the torture chambers of the future, you may well be offered the choice between having water dripped on you and listening to the sound of a Mondeo waiting to turn right.

Only two things leap out: the oval clock makes the whole central panel look like an in-car Teasmade; and does that irritating \"boing\" noise have to accompany the winking of the indicators? In the torture chambers of the future, you may well be offered the choice between having water dripped on you and listening to the sound of a Mondeo waiting to turn right. My advice would be: go with the water. Still, it's the only thing about the car that is painful. The price certainly isn't. The lowdown Ford Mondeo LX 1.8 Price: \u00a314,595 Top speed: 127 mph Acceleration: 0-62 in 10.2 seconds Consumption: 36.6mpg (combined) At the wheel: Dave Bassett On the stereo: Whitney Houston En route for: Southend",

The programme was watched by a mere 300,000 viewers, one of the broadcaster's worst prime-time audiences ever. The audience share for the channel went down to 1% - a tenth of the channel's average. Channel 4's brave scheduling for a Saturday night proved an alternative for the minority not watching the live final of Stars in their Eyes . It crowned a barnstorming week for ITV, according to unofficial overnight figures, with just over 10m - 43% of the audience - tuning in to see the hit show presented by Matthew Kelly. And 11.3m tuned in to see Nicola Kirsch's impersonation of Maria Callas voted the winner at an updated 15-minute show at 10.15pm. A rare Saturday night outing for Coronation Street had 11.8m and half the available audience from 9.15pm. Then Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? continued the good work from 9.45pm, averaging 11.9m and a 53% share. Overall, ITV had its third best peak-time performance of the year last week, with a little help from the David Beckham documentary, the Full Monty terrestrial premiere and Coronation Street every night. The broadcaster averaged 42.1% of peak-time viewing ( 7pm-10.30pm), 16.5 percentage share points ahead of BBC1, between Monday November 27 and Sunday December 3. The BBC1 Ten O'Clock News had its worst week yet, averaging 4.2m and a 20% share. On Sunday night, ITV's Cold Feet clawed back some viewers from BBC1's Kingsley Amis adaptation Take a Girl Like You. Cold Feet averaged 8.8m, up by 600,000 compared to last Sunday, while Take a Girl Like You was down by 1.3m, to 4.3m, on its second outing. Elsewhere on Sunday night, Channel 5 documentary The Third Reich in Colour, presented by Evening Standard editor Max Hastings, took 1.3m and a 5% share from 8-9pm.",

The hospital in North Tyneside that is revolutionising the way that we provide emergency care in this country and slashing waiting times in the process.</p> <p>I want to thank the staff in the NHS and social services for their commitment. I value the effort you put in day and day out and I recognise all the hard work that has gone into preparing for this winter.</p> <p>We are matching your effort with increased resources, over \u00a3300m on winter pressures alone. And together, the effort, the money and the reforms are starting to produce results. </p> <p>Today we are releasing figures that show waiting lists for October are down by 7,000. This is the eighth month in a row that that we have maintained our manifesto commitment. Of course, as we have said before, over the winter period there will be a switch of focus to treating emergency medical cases, which impacts on waiting lists for elective surgery. But the underlying trend is now firmly downwards.</p> <p>Today also sees the publication of the latest figures on breast cancer referrals. 95% of women - over 5,500 a month - are now being seen within two weeks, when their GP decides that they need to be seen urgently.</p> <p>None of this is easy. None of it will be perfect. During the winter, just as during any other part of the year, a massive organisation dealing with a million people a day will face problems. Under-investment over decades is not put right in 3 years - it takes years to train doctors and consultants. Until we have delivered the increases in capacity year on year for several more years there are bound to be pressures. And there will be cases where patients do not get the care they should. Medicine is not an exact science and sometimes mistakes will get made. </p> <p>But let's praise our staff not demoralise them. Let's tell patients how good parts of the NHS are, not only how bad. </p> <p>What I say to people is that the NHS is going in the right direction. It does have more money. It does have more doctors and nurses, with more on the way. It does have more beds. It does have better management. It does have detailed and well worked out plans for the winter. But inevitably the NHS is not yet the service patients would like it to be. </p> <p>There is still a long way to go. But we will work with the brilliant staff of the NHS to give the people of Britain the standard of health care they deserve. </p> <p>This winter whilst most of us are sitting down for our Christmas meal with the family, thousands of dedicated doctors, nurses, consultants, porters, cleaners, ambulance staff will be giving up their Christmas, missing their family, in order to serve the public and save lives. </p> <p>They deserve our support and thanks. </p> <p>So to sum up: there is more money; more nurses, more beds; there has been far more preparation; but there will be pressures and difficulties. But let us get a sense of balance, support the NHS staff who give a wonderful service to the majority of patients and not fall into the trap of saying that every time something goes wrong, the NHS is in crisis or on its knees. The glass is half full, not half empty.</p>",

Already compared with last winter we have: \u0095 3.2m more doses of flu vaccine \u0095 16m more people covered by NHS Direct \u0095 2,900 more intensive home care packages on top of the 8,000 from the previous year \u0095 1,350 more acute beds \u0095 445 extra critical care beds \u0095 over 6,000 more nurses, giving a total of 16,000 more since the election in 1997 \u0095 thousands more operations carried out in the private sector. These increases are all the more welcome because I know that in very many areas they are being matched by improvements in service, as I saw for myself last week. Specialist GPs in Bradford providing a wide range of diagnostic services and minor operations for their patients without them ever having to go near a hospital. The hospital in North Tyneside that is revolutionising the way that we provide emergency care in this country and slashing waiting times in the process. I want to thank the staff in the NHS and social services for their commitment. I value the effort you put in day and day out and I recognise all the hard work that has gone into preparing for this winter. We are matching your effort with increased resources, over \u00a3300m on winter pressures alone. And together, the effort, the money and the reforms are starting to produce results. Today we are releasing figures that show waiting lists for October are down by 7,000. This is the eighth month in a row that that we have maintained our manifesto commitment. Of course, as we have said before, over the winter period there will be a switch of focus to treating emergency medical cases, which impacts on waiting lists for elective surgery. But the underlying trend is now firmly downwards. Today also sees the publication of the latest figures on breast cancer referrals. 95% of women - over 5,500 a month - are now being seen within two weeks, when their GP decides that they need to be seen urgently. None of this is easy. None of it will be perfect. During the winter, just as during any other part of the year, a massive organisation dealing with a million people a day will face problems. Under-investment over decades is not put right in 3 years - it takes years to train doctors and consultants. Until we have delivered the increases in capacity year on year for several more years there are bound to be pressures. And there will be cases where patients do not get the care they should. Medicine is not an exact science and sometimes mistakes will get made. But let's praise our staff not demoralise them. Let's tell patients how good parts of the NHS are, not only how bad. What I say to people is that the NHS is going in the right direction. It does have more money. It does have more doctors and nurses, with more on the way. It does have more beds. It does have better management. It does have detailed and well worked out plans for the winter. But inevitably the NHS is not yet the service patients would like it to be. There is still a long way to go. But we will work with the brilliant staff of the NHS to give the people of Britain the standard of health care they deserve. This winter whilst most of us are sitting down for our Christmas meal with the family, thousands of dedicated doctors, nurses, consultants, porters, cleaners, ambulance staff will be giving up their Christmas, missing their family, in order to serve the public and save lives. They deserve our support and thanks. So to sum up: there is more money; more nurses, more beds; there has been far more preparation; but there will be pressures and difficulties. But let us get a sense of balance, support the NHS staff who give a wonderful service to the majority of patients and not fall into the trap of saying that every time something goes wrong, the NHS is in crisis or on its knees. The glass is half full, not half empty.",

Throughout his coaching career, which has spanned 27 years and eight clubs, the Mallorca boss has never ceased to entertain. And this Sunday he was at it again when Mallorca travelled to La Romareda to face Real Zaragoza. </p> <p>Alberto Luque had just scored a fabulous goal for the visitors to level the score at 1-1 when Aragon\u00e9s struck. The veteran boss decided to replace Samuel Eto'o with Iovan Stankovic. The Cameroon forward - who's been pulled off more times than (actually, let's not go there) ... erm, has been subbed a lot this year - stomped off in a bit of a huff. Aragon\u00e9s rushed over to the dug-out, grabbed the unhappy striker, and proceeded to shake him violently, screaming obscenities into his face from point-blank range. Unfortunately, CanalPlus couldn't get a microphone into the dug-out in time and Aragon\u00e9s hasn't yet revealed exactly what he said. It's safe to assume, though, that the Mallorca boss - as swearing in Spain dictates - defecated on the striker's mother who, in his opinion, resorts to the oldest profession in order to make money.</p> <p>Eto'o has since told the press that his days at Mallorca are over. Bizarrely enough, though, the forward - who claims to have been substituted when he \"hasn't even been tired\" (yes, there's a reason for that, Samuel) - attributed his decision to his lack of minutes, not his manager's all-too-public outburst.</p> <p>Luis Aragon\u00e9s isn't the first coach who's needed to deal with internal disputes this year. Earlier in the season, the Man in the Moustache was faced with a dressing room rebellion over Real Madrid's treatment of Steve McManaman. And just a couple of weeks back Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a's Moroccan centre-back Nourredine Naybet responded to accusations of laziness by telling coach Javier Irureta to \"go and take it up the arse.\" The coaches' reactions have been getting progressively funnier: del Bosque rather boringly backed down, Irureta responded by saying \"No, you go and take it up the arse\", and now this. Whatever next? Lorenzo Serra Ferrer finally losing his patience and attacking comedy keeper Richard Dutruel with a pair of scissors? Poor old Dutruel. The man whose dreadful hairstyle is matched only by his goalkeeping skills has had a terrible season. And just when it looked like things couldn't get any worse, they did - Barcelona travelled to Vigo on Saturday night to take on Dutruel's ex-club, Celta. </p> <p>But for the lone Galician with a megaphone and an inexhaustible reserve of energy chanting \"Vee-go, Vee-go\" throughout, the Bala\u00eddos crowd was unusually subdued. Except, that is, whenever the French keeper - who agreed to go to Bar\u00e7a last year despite being under contract at Celta - got the ball. Then the crowd erupted into whistles and boos. The whistles turned to howls of laughter just before half time when Dutruel challenged Catanha for a cross, dropped the ball (no surprise there), and twisted his knee - falling to the floor in a ridiculously exaggerated and delayed fashion - a la Paul Alcock. The ordeal didn't end there, either. Over-zealous officials insisted on carrying Dutruel off on one of those electric car-type 'stretchers'. And they took the long way round the running track, too, kindly giving every single Celta fan the chance to have a good laugh at the forlorn figure from close-up. </p> <p>Surprise, surprise - the departure of Dutruel heralded a significant improvement in Barcelona's fortunes. 3-1 down to a Catanha hat-trick when he left, Lorenzo Serra Ferrer's side threw caution to the wind in the second half and managed to bring the score level at 3-3, Rivaldo setting up both for Patrik Kluivert. Best of all for the cul\u00e9s, though, was the return from injury of inspirational captain Pep Guardiola. Meanwhile, teenage keeper Jos\u00e9 Reina was delighted to make his Bar\u00e7a debut, and told the press that his \"dad'll be pretty pleased too.\" His dad might get to see a bit more of him, Dutruel is out until February at least.</p> <p>Another injury returnee delighting fans is Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a's Brazilian superstar Djalminha. Last week's hero turned in another sensational performance as Depor ran out 2-0 winners at the Olympic stadium against Espanyol - the Brazilian creating the second for Roy Makaay with yet another sublime touch. Djalminha's return is bound to be a huge boost for Depor as they prepare for this week's trip to Milan. An even bigger boost came in the shape of draw specialists Valladolid, who held Mendieta-less Valencia to 0-0 at the weekend. The result leaves Depor top, two points clear. Valencia boss H\u00e9ctor C\u00faper admitted that his side \"missed\" their captain, but insisted that his absence was no excuse enough for such a \"poor performance\".</p> <p>Samuel Eto'o isn't the only unhappy Cameroon international in Spain. Real Madrid full-back Geremi bore the brunt of the criticism after his side's Intercontinental defeat in Japan on Tuesday and claims that the constant attacks have left him feeling like the club's \"ugly duckling\". Luckily for Geremi, the Man in the Moustache has shown his caring side, refusing to join the chorus of abuse and insisting that \"I still believe in him as a person and as a player\". Kind words, but they didn't prevent Geremi from turning in another dreadful performance against Osasuna in Vitoria on Saturday night. To be fair, the \"bull\", as Mart\u00edn Posse so eloquently put it last week, wasn't alone. Madrid were uninspiring throughout, but were rescued by Iv\u00e1n Helguera's last-minute goal and ran out 3-2 winners. Fernando Hierro breathed a particularly big sigh of relief - the Madrid captain had missed his second (and Madrid's third) penalty of the season. Spot-kicks may well be yet another responsibility dumped on Luis Figo's increasingly over-loaded shoulders. </p> <p>The defeat leaves Osasuna bottom, just one point behind Racing Santander - who were beaten 4-1 at fourth-placed Rayo Vallecano - and three behind Real Sociedad, who drew 1-1 with Las Palmas. The day's Basque derbi was a typically bruising encounter - two red cards (including Bilbao's physio) and nine yellows. It finished with Alav\u00e9s beating Athletic Bilbao for the first time in 70 years by 2-1. It wasn't quite so much fun over in Villarreal, where Numancia drew 0-0, but there was plenty of excitement in Oviedo. Radi Antic's side remain invincible at the New Carlos Tartiere - 2-1 down with two minutes to go, goals from Victor Onopko and a sensational free-kick from Djorje Tomic brought their sixth win in seven home matches.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in Guatemala, Spain have just won the F\u00fatbol Sala World Cup. Now, for the uninitiated, F\u00fatbol Sala is basically indoor football with handball-style goals and a ball that doesn't bounce - indeed, ex-Real Oviedo brummie superstar Keith Thompson once aptly described the ball as being \"like a pudding.\" Anyway, Spain ran out 4-3 winners against three-times world champions Brazil, with a goal 29 seconds from full time by Javi Rodr\u00edguez. The real star of the show, though, was Spanish goalie Jes\u00fas Claver\u00eda, whose display was described by sports daily Marca as \"providential\" (Jes\u00fas, providential, geddit? ho ho). With two keepers out injured and the transfer window fast approaching, Lorenzo Serra Ferrer might just have taken note.</p>",

And just a couple of weeks back Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a's Moroccan centre-back Nourredine Naybet responded to accusations of laziness by telling coach Javier Irureta to \"go and take it up the arse.\" The coaches' reactions have been getting progressively funnier: del Bosque rather boringly backed down, Irureta responded by saying \"No, you go and take it up the arse\", and now this. Whatever next? Lorenzo Serra Ferrer finally losing his patience and attacking comedy keeper Richard Dutruel with a pair of scissors? Poor old Dutruel. The man whose dreadful hairstyle is matched only by his goalkeeping skills has had a terrible season. And just when it looked like things couldn't get any worse, they did - Barcelona travelled to Vigo on Saturday night to take on Dutruel's ex-club, Celta. But for the lone Galician with a megaphone and an inexhaustible reserve of energy chanting \"Vee-go, Vee-go\" throughout, the Bala\u00eddos crowd was unusually subdued. Except, that is, whenever the French keeper - who agreed to go to Bar\u00e7a last year despite being under contract at Celta - got the ball. Then the crowd erupted into whistles and boos. The whistles turned to howls of laughter just before half time when Dutruel challenged Catanha for a cross, dropped the ball (no surprise there), and twisted his knee - falling to the floor in a ridiculously exaggerated and delayed fashion - a la Paul Alcock. The ordeal didn't end there, either. Over-zealous officials insisted on carrying Dutruel off on one of those electric car-type 'stretchers'. And they took the long way round the running track, too, kindly giving every single Celta fan the chance to have a good laugh at the forlorn figure from close-up. Surprise, surprise - the departure of Dutruel heralded a significant improvement in Barcelona's fortunes. 3-1 down to a Catanha hat-trick when he left, Lorenzo Serra Ferrer's side threw caution to the wind in the second half and managed to bring the score level at 3-3, Rivaldo setting up both for Patrik Kluivert. Best of all for the cul\u00e9s, though, was the return from injury of inspirational captain Pep Guardiola. Meanwhile, teenage keeper Jos\u00e9 Reina was delighted to make his Bar\u00e7a debut, and told the press that his \"dad'll be pretty pleased too.\" His dad might get to see a bit more of him, Dutruel is out until February at least. Another injury returnee delighting fans is Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a's Brazilian superstar Djalminha. Last week's hero turned in another sensational performance as Depor ran out 2-0 winners at the Olympic stadium against Espanyol - the Brazilian creating the second for Roy Makaay with yet another sublime touch. Djalminha's return is bound to be a huge boost for Depor as they prepare for this week's trip to Milan. An even bigger boost came in the shape of draw specialists Valladolid, who held Mendieta-less Valencia to 0-0 at the weekend. The result leaves Depor top, two points clear. Valencia boss H\u00e9ctor C\u00faper admitted that his side \"missed\" their captain, but insisted that his absence was no excuse enough for such a \"poor performance\". Samuel Eto'o isn't the only unhappy Cameroon international in Spain. Real Madrid full-back Geremi bore the brunt of the criticism after his side's Intercontinental defeat in Japan on Tuesday and claims that the constant attacks have left him feeling like the club's \"ugly duckling\". Luckily for Geremi, the Man in the Moustache has shown his caring side, refusing to join the chorus of abuse and insisting that \"I still believe in him as a person and as a player\". Kind words, but they didn't prevent Geremi from turning in another dreadful performance against Osasuna in Vitoria on Saturday night. To be fair, the \"bull\", as Mart\u00edn Posse so eloquently put it last week, wasn't alone. Madrid were uninspiring throughout, but were rescued by Iv\u00e1n Helguera's last-minute goal and ran out 3-2 winners. Fernando Hierro breathed a particularly big sigh of relief - the Madrid captain had missed his second (and Madrid's third) penalty of the season. Spot-kicks may well be yet another responsibility dumped on Luis Figo's increasingly over-loaded shoulders. The defeat leaves Osasuna bottom, just one point behind Racing Santander - who were beaten 4-1 at fourth-placed Rayo Vallecano - and three behind Real Sociedad, who drew 1-1 with Las Palmas. The day's Basque derbi was a typically bruising encounter - two red cards (including Bilbao's physio) and nine yellows. It finished with Alav\u00e9s beating Athletic Bilbao for the first time in 70 years by 2-1. It wasn't quite so much fun over in Villarreal, where Numancia drew 0-0, but there was plenty of excitement in Oviedo. Radi Antic's side remain invincible at the New Carlos Tartiere - 2-1 down with two minutes to go, goals from Victor Onopko and a sensational free-kick from Djorje Tomic brought their sixth win in seven home matches. Meanwhile, in Guatemala, Spain have just won the F\u00fatbol Sala World Cup. Now, for the uninitiated, F\u00fatbol Sala is basically indoor football with handball-style goals and a ball that doesn't bounce - indeed, ex-Real Oviedo brummie superstar Keith Thompson once aptly described the ball as being \"like a pudding.\" Anyway, Spain ran out 4-3 winners against three-times world champions Brazil, with a goal 29 seconds from full time by Javi Rodr\u00edguez. The real star of the show, though, was Spanish goalie Jes\u00fas Claver\u00eda, whose display was described by sports daily Marca as \"providential\" (Jes\u00fas, providential, geddit? ho ho). With two keepers out injured and the transfer window fast approaching, Lorenzo Serra Ferrer might just have taken note.",

      "body": "<p>Voluntary organisations desperately need access to low-cost and flexible training if they are to continue to meet government demands, says a consultation paper from the national body set up to identify and meet training needs for the voluntary sector.</p> <p>The government's social inclusion agenda looks to voluntary organisations to involve marginalised groups. Yet many voluntary organisations are finding that lack of resources - both human and financial - combined with the demands of service provision prevent them from developing the staff skills and providing the personal development opportunities which are key to meeting the government's goals.</p> <p>The draft workforce development plan, produced by the Voluntary Sector National Training Organisation (VSNTO), outlines the skills shortages and recommends how to address these problems. </p> <p>According to the report, one pressure point has been the government's increasing emphasis on partnership work to deliver initiatives in the fields of social care, health, regeneration and employment. Another is the trend for income to be related to specific, often short-term, projects which results in organisations having to meet differing demands from funders in terms of quality and monitoring systems. </p> <p>Research by the VSNTO shows that the biggest skills gaps for paid staff relate to fundraising, management and IT. Communication skills and IT are the main skills gaps among volunteers. In a separate study by London Boroughs Grants, 84% of organisations identified cost and 65% identified lack of time as a barrier to learning. </p> <p>The draft plan is out for consultation until December 22 and comes in advance of the new national and local Learning and Skills Councils. From next year, these will encourage new types of learning providers - including the voluntary and community sectors - to apply for funding to deliver solutions based on learning. These could include on-the-job or internet-based training. The plan also recommends that regional development agencies provide funding to support skills development managers in each region, who will promote development and accreditation. </p> <p>Ben Kernighan, head of the VSNTO in England, is keen for the sector to feed into this process and respond to the plan. \"This is a window of opportunity to influence people in new roles by making them aware of the barriers to training, and highlighting the sector's role in promoting equality of opportunity and social inclusion,\" he said.</p> <p>One initiative aimed at addressing these skills shortages is Project 2001. Set up in 1998 by the Royal Society for the Encouragement of the Arts, Manufactures and Commerce, the project provides small voluntary organisations with financial support and advice to enable them to recognise and accredit the skills of their paid staff and volunteers. </p> <p>More than 200 organisations in the pilot regions of London and Yorkshire and Humberside have benefited from contributions of up to \u00a31,000 towards training costs, access to up to three days' worth of advice from an accreditation adviser or information about qualifications. </p> <p>Key partners in the project include the VSNTO and the National Association of Councils for Voluntary Service, which supports the network of more than 250 councils for voluntary service responsible for developing the sector at local level. </p> <p>A survey of participating organisations shows the positive impact of intervention with financial and other resources. One in nine say they now have more motivated staff and volunteers, while a similar number say that their customer service has improved. Significantly, one in eight have developed new links as a result of working on training and accreditation, and many have been able to access further grants as a result of receiving one from Project 2001. </p> <p>Project 2001 director Janet Fleming believes this evidence makes a persuasive argument for funding learning in the sector, and adds that funders should be willing to support these costs as part of their project funding. \"It is essential that money is spent on giving structured support to the sector through training,\" she said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Voluntary organisations desperately need access to low-cost and flexible training if they are to continue to meet government demands, says a consultation paper from the national body set up to identify and meet training needs for the voluntary sector. The government's social inclusion agenda looks to voluntary organisations to involve marginalised groups. Yet many voluntary organisations are finding that lack of resources - both human and financial - combined with the demands of service provision prevent them from developing the staff skills and providing the personal development opportunities which are key to meeting the government's goals. The draft workforce development plan, produced by the Voluntary Sector National Training Organisation (VSNTO), outlines the skills shortages and recommends how to address these problems. According to the report, one pressure point has been the government's increasing emphasis on partnership work to deliver initiatives in the fields of social care, health, regeneration and employment. Another is the trend for income to be related to specific, often short-term, projects which results in organisations having to meet differing demands from funders in terms of quality and monitoring systems. Research by the VSNTO shows that the biggest skills gaps for paid staff relate to fundraising, management and IT. Communication skills and IT are the main skills gaps among volunteers. In a separate study by London Boroughs Grants, 84% of organisations identified cost and 65% identified lack of time as a barrier to learning. The draft plan is out for consultation until December 22 and comes in advance of the new national and local Learning and Skills Councils. From next year, these will encourage new types of learning providers - including the voluntary and community sectors - to apply for funding to deliver solutions based on learning. These could include on-the-job or internet-based training. The plan also recommends that regional development agencies provide funding to support skills development managers in each region, who will promote development and accreditation. Ben Kernighan, head of the VSNTO in England, is keen for the sector to feed into this process and respond to the plan. \"This is a window of opportunity to influence people in new roles by making them aware of the barriers to training, and highlighting the sector's role in promoting equality of opportunity and social inclusion,\" he said. One initiative aimed at addressing these skills shortages is Project 2001. Set up in 1998 by the Royal Society for the Encouragement of the Arts, Manufactures and Commerce, the project provides small voluntary organisations with financial support and advice to enable them to recognise and accredit the skills of their paid staff and volunteers. More than 200 organisations in the pilot regions of London and Yorkshire and Humberside have benefited from contributions of up to \u00a31,000 towards training costs, access to up to three days' worth of advice from an accreditation adviser or information about qualifications. Key partners in the project include the VSNTO and the National Association of Councils for Voluntary Service, which supports the network of more than 250 councils for voluntary service responsible for developing the sector at local level. A survey of participating organisations shows the positive impact of intervention with financial and other resources. One in nine say they now have more motivated staff and volunteers, while a similar number say that their customer service has improved. Significantly, one in eight have developed new links as a result of working on training and accreditation, and many have been able to access further grants as a result of receiving one from Project 2001. Project 2001 director Janet Fleming believes this evidence makes a persuasive argument for funding learning in the sector, and adds that funders should be willing to support these costs as part of their project funding. \"It is essential that money is spent on giving structured support to the sector through training,\" she said.",

      "body": "<p>The NHS plan pledges to join up health and social services by \"removing the outdated institutional barriers between health and social care which have got in the way of people getting the care they need when they need it\".</p> <p>The Health Act 1999 removed legal obstacles to joint working and thus underpins much of the plan. For the first time, social services and the NHS are expected to have pooled budgets for a variety of services. Schemes covering budgets of more than \u00a3200m are already up and running but these benefit only a small minority of patients. </p> <p>The plan requires that joint budget powers are applied across the country. Social care will be delivered in new settings such as GP surgeries. \"Local care networks\" of social service staff, GPs and other primary and community health teams will jointly assess patients' needs. An extra \u00a3900m has been allocated in 2003-04 for personal care plans, espcially for older people. </p> <p>The plan also picks up recommendations in the act to merge the commissioning services of local and health authorities. Either authority can now take the lead to provide \"one-stop care packages\" on behalf of both services. </p> <p>The commission for health improvement, the audit commission and the social services inspectorate will monitor health and social care organisations, charting the progress of joint working. The targets include reducing delays in discharging older patients from hospital, reducing preventable emergency hospital admissions, readmitting older people and people with mental health problems and assessing older people's needs more rapidly. </p> <p>Authorities which work together successfuly are given incentives to keep up progress. In social services, \u00a350m a year will be available from April 2002 to reward improved joint working in 2001. From April 2003 this will rise to \u00a3100m. Grants will initially focus on intermediate care performance: those services which promote independence and improve quality of care for the elderly.</p> <p><strong>What are care trusts?</strong><br> The plan expects all primary care groups to become trusts by Aprl 2004. Care trusts will be set up in areas where health and social services want to forge close partnerships. Single, multi-purpose legal bodies would be formed to commission care, and councils would be authorised to oversee the care trusts and decide where they are needed.

      "bodyText": "The NHS plan pledges to join up health and social services by \"removing the outdated institutional barriers between health and social care which have got in the way of people getting the care they need when they need it\". The Health Act 1999 removed legal obstacles to joint working and thus underpins much of the plan. For the first time, social services and the NHS are expected to have pooled budgets for a variety of services. Schemes covering budgets of more than \u00a3200m are already up and running but these benefit only a small minority of patients. The plan requires that joint budget powers are applied across the country. Social care will be delivered in new settings such as GP surgeries. \"Local care networks\" of social service staff, GPs and other primary and community health teams will jointly assess patients' needs. An extra \u00a3900m has been allocated in 2003-04 for personal care plans, espcially for older people. The plan also picks up recommendations in the act to merge the commissioning services of local and health authorities. Either authority can now take the lead to provide \"one-stop care packages\" on behalf of both services. The commission for health improvement, the audit commission and the social services inspectorate will monitor health and social care organisations, charting the progress of joint working. The targets include reducing delays in discharging older patients from hospital, reducing preventable emergency hospital admissions, readmitting older people and people with mental health problems and assessing older people's needs more rapidly. Authorities which work together successfuly are given incentives to keep up progress. In social services, \u00a350m a year will be available from April 2002 to reward improved joint working in 2001. From April 2003 this will rise to \u00a3100m. Grants will initially focus on intermediate care performance: those services which promote independence and improve quality of care for the elderly. What are care trusts? The plan expects all primary care groups to become trusts by Aprl 2004. Care trusts will be set up in areas where health and social services want to forge close partnerships. Single, multi-purpose legal bodies would be formed to commission care, and councils would be authorised to oversee the care trusts and decide where they are needed. The model for this idea is being enacted in Somerset, where the joint service provides a single care plan, a single key worker and a unified multi-disciplinary team to address the needs of each client.",

Billed as the most radical reform ever of the partnership between the health service and social care, it sets out a 10 year programme for change in England (Wales and Northern Ireland are developing their own, probably similar, plans).The programme brings money, staffing and organisational changes to health and social services.

Billed as the most radical reform ever of the partnership between the health service and social care, it sets out a 10 year programme for change in England (Wales and Northern Ireland are developing their own, probably similar, plans).The programme brings money, staffing and organisational changes to health and social services. A key target is that the two sectors start working together much more closely. While the NHS gets \u00a319bn over the next five years, social care gets \u00a31.5bn by 2004.

Nicknamed \"Bumby\", Jack spent his early years in Paris and the Austrian Alps. These years are described in A Moveable Feast, Hemingway's autobiography, published in 1964. The book ends with a description of Hadley greeting him at the train station, smiling, \"her lovely face tanned by the snow and the sun\", and Bumby at her side, \"blond and chunky and with winter cheeks looking like a good Voralberg boy.\" Hemingway had just decided to abandon his wife and child.</p> <p>Jack was five when his parents divorced. Sent to boarding schools, he only saw his father during summer vacations. As he grew up, they went fishing together and boxed. When Hemingway was too busy at work on a novel, he paid for Jack to stay at a dude ranch in Montana. Sending his love, Hemingway promised to bring his son ammunition for his rifle and asked if he should order some pistol cartridges, too. As a teenager they drank frozen daiquiris together, and spent time in Pamplona and Havana. After attending the University of Montana and Dartmouth College, Jack dropped out before taking his degree and enlisted in the US Army.

But there is a difference between how he tried to operate and how <a href=\"http://www.reedmee.com\" target=\"_NEW\">reedmee.com</a> operates. For all his pulling power, King relied on trust and honesty; and the novel was written over a period of time, which tested both the patience and the memory of the reader. With reedmee.com you read the free sample and if you like it, pay your money, either by credit card, which is instantaneous but makes some people nervous, or by cheque. Then you are sent the whole novel in a format of your choice. </p> <p> The site can take greater risks with new writers, because there is less financial outlay; yet, ironically, potential profits are greater. Each novel is sold for under \u00a34 of which I, as author, get roughly \u00a31.60. But I'm not in it for the money; I just want to be read. E-publishing has fulfilled that wish, whereas the traditional publishers seem less and less able to take risks.</p> <p> At the recent Frankfurt book fair there was a first prize of $100,000 for best original e-book. If you take into account the development of hand-held readers from companies such as Palm and Handspring, the eco-friendly saving of paper, and reader-author interactivity, should publishers and bookshops feel threatened? </p> <p> \"We do not see ourselves as replacing traditional publishing,\" says reedmee.com founder Chris Pickard, who has 18 years of publishing experience under his belt. \"Our readers will be able to support new writing talent and read manuscripts which might never have reached the book shelves. If some of our authors migrate to conventional publishing, that's fine.\" </p> <p>But is it possible that these authors would never have reached the shelves because they weren't good enough to get a deal anywhere other than the internet? With publishers now in the hands of fewer and fewer companies, and with bookshops under enormous pressure to get customers in and out as quickly as possible, with a Harry Potter or Bill Bryson in their pocket, smaller publishers are struggling to do what they do best: discover new, brave voices, who may not be the next Nick Hornby (or Anthea Turner) but who have something to say, and say it well. </p> <p> \"It's getting harder and harder to get our books on to the shelves,\" says Hayley Ann, founder of Codex Books, who publishes Billy Childish, Stewart Home and other \"off-the-wall\" writers. \"There are two problems we have with Waterstone's in particular at the moment. First, they aren't taking as many titles from the independents; and second, when those books they do take sell out, they aren't re-ordering, even though they're obviously selling well.\" </p> <p>Ann believes the problems at Waterstone's stem from the power of publishing conglomerates. Fewer and fewer companies own more and more publishers, and profit comes first - but hasn't it always? \"Waterstone's is owned by HMV Media, and they've been trying to sell it for about a year now. I believe that Tim Waterstone actually wants to buy it back, which would be one solution, but he probably can't afford it. They're trying to make the company attractive to potential buyers, and that means maximised profits.\" </p> <p>Robert Topping, former manager of Waterstone's in Manchester, feels new management was responsible for a tougher line with independents which has, ironically, led to a decrease in profits. \"When Tim [Waterstone] ran things, he left the purchasing of books up to the manager of each shop. With these new, non-book people at HQ running things, profit and productivity always come first. They're talking about banning sales reps from publishers completely, just ordering from catalogues. But publishers and book sellers need to meet, to learn from each other.\" </p> <p>Having been a freelancer for years, I almost succeeded in having a thriller published in 1995. But Orion changed their minds, on the grounds that The Provider - about a Scouse gangster who has to find \u00a3100k to pay for his daughter's life-saving operation in America - was crap. And they were right. I decided to leave gangster novels to public school boys, and returned to the subjects I knew best: the dispossessed detritus of the society Margaret Thatcher had refused even to recognise. I went back to a book I'd been working on for years, Three Bridges, and got myself an agent. </p> <p>\"Hello Mark, this is Dr Radice here, of Gregory and Radice. I've just finished reading Three Bridges. I can't say I enjoyed it, in fact it was like reading a 500-page suicide note, but it does show you have talent, so if you can come up with something more uplifting I'd like to offer you a deal.\" A few days later the contract came through the post, complete with film rights options and percentage fees for Russian translations. I had made it. </p> <p>Or so I thought. Two years and numerous re-writes later, publisher after publisher had turned down the book, with comments such as these: \"I found it a fascinating novel, the characterisation is terrific and the plotting works impressively on many varied levels. However, I'm afraid it felt a little too bleak and unusual for our list and I think it would be a tough one to break out as commercial fiction. Mark is certainly talented and there's no doubt that Behind Blue Eyes marks an impressive debut, I'm just not quite convinced that we could do it justice at this stage - it's probably a little too avant-garde for us.\" </p> <p> Thanks to reedmee, which liked the off-the-wall quality, I'm now getting featured in the press and even got interviewed on radio by Robert Elms. Apparently there's even a small fan club developing in the States, which is bit of a worry. </p> <p>E-writers aren't helped because some newspapers and even the Big Issue won't review e-books at all. Unless some multinational corporation has given it approval, it seems the book isn't valid. But because I have refused to compromise my beliefs and my style of writing, I think my books are just as important as the latest six-figure deal by some pretty young thing.

      "bodyText": "Frontline, the distribution company owned by publishers Emap, Haymarket, BBC Worldwide and Attic Futura, has fired a warning shot across the bows of WH Smith, saying it will re-tender its \u00a3150m magazine contract. Frontline wants the company to guarantee that small retailers will not be cut out of the loop by WH Smith's plan for a centrally-controlled distribution system. Simon Curtin, managing director of Frontline, said: \"We are putting contracts out to tender in the next fortnight. \"A significant factor in making awards will be a wholesaler with a recent track record in delivering high-level services to both small and large retailers.\" WH Smith currently distributes 27% of Frontline's magazine business, a contract thought to be worth \u00a3150m in revenue and between \u00a312m and \u00a315m in annual profits. Frontline advised its four publishers that it was in their interests to appoint a wholesaler that backed the Periodical Publishers' Association's (PPA) \"Blueprint\" plan, designed to keep small retailers in the loop. The PPA and several publishing companies have protested against plans by WH Smith and Tesco to create a centrally controlled distribution system. They feel it would put many small retailers and newsagents out of business and damage their sales. An alternative distribution plan called \"Blueprint\", put together by the PPA, recommends a compromise plan including a central hub to make the onward delivery of papers and magazines more efficient, but allowing existing regional distribution relationships to stay in place. It has been endorsed by most newspaper and magazine publishers and even Tesco, but WH Smith is refusing to sign up to it. WH Smith dismissed as \"pure speculation\" the notion that Frontline was re-tendering its contract because it was unhappy with WH Smith's plans. WH Smith confirmed it would be rebidding for the contract, due to be awarded in April, and said it sought to increase its share of the Frontline business from 27% to 43%. Last week the stakes were raised for WH Smith by a decision from Associated Newspapers, publisher of the Daily Mail, the Mail on Sunday and the Evening Standard, to terminate two-thirds of its supplier contracts with WH Smith. News International, publisher of the Times, the Sunday Times, the Sun and the News of the World, is also reviewing its relationship with the distributor.",

Patrick Vieira won 9 of his 10 challenges in midfield.</p> <p><strong>ASTON VILLA 1 - 1 NEWCASTLE</strong></p> <p><strong>Key man:</strong> Warren Barton won 17 of 19 challenges, made 8 clearances and intercepted the ball 3 times.<br> <strong>Weak link:</strong> With no natural strikers, Newcastle produced only a single attempt on goal. Meanwhile, David Ginola had a bit of a nightmare: 18 of his 37 passes went to opposition players.<br> <strong>The Edge:</strong> Villa will be feeling unlucky, having made 13 attempts and accurate crosses to Newcastle's 3. But the visitors made up with a battling edge - 131 challenges to Villa's 84 and 22 fouls to Villa's 14. </p> <p> <strong>BRADFORD 2 - 1 COVENTRY</strong></p> <p><strong>Key man:</strong> Dean Windass completed 42 of 55 passes - 18 of 23 in the forward zone - won 11 of 13 challenges and set up the equaliser.<br> <strong>Weak link:</strong> Despite a five-man midfield, Coventry had only 42% of net possession.<br> <strong>The Edge:</strong> Bradford were the keener chasers, making 157 challenges to Coventry's 81. Robert Molenaar added stability to Bradford's defence, winning 21 of 24 challenges and making 11 clearances.</p> <p><strong>IPSWICH 0 - 1 DERBY</strong></p> <p><strong>Key man:</strong> Seth Johnson won all his 15 tackles, made 5 clearances and set up the winner for Rory Delap.<br> <strong>Weak link:</strong> David Johnson and Marcus Stewart had only two attempts on goal and failed to exploit Ipswich's dominance - the home team had 75% of net possession.<br> <strong>The Edge:</strong> Derby battled hard, making 130 challenges to 64 by Ipswich. Chris Riggott and Horacio Carbonari won 42 of 46 challenges and made 30 clearances, as Derby kept their fourth clean sheet in five matches - in that time, they've only conceded to Manchester United!</p> <p><strong>LEICESTER 3 - 1 LEEDS</strong></p> <p><strong>Key man:</strong> Neil Lennon won 12 of 19 challenges, and was accurate in 51 of 58 passes, including 11 of 11 in attacking third. <br> <strong>Weak link:</strong> Only 7 of 35 Leeds crosses found a team-mate.<br> <strong>The Edge:</strong> Leicester had 9 attempts in first half, 8 of which were on target: three found the back of the net. Leicester also had more bite in the tackle: they attempted 178 challenges to 99 by Leeds. Harry Kewell, in 30 minutes of long-awaited return, completed 9 of 12 passes, won only 2 of 6 challenges, and had 2 attempts at goal, both off target. </p> <p><strong>LIVERPOOL 3 - 0 CHARLTON</strong></p> <p><strong>Key man:</strong> Vladimir Smicer completed 12 of 13 passes, 4 of 4 crosses, had a shot and laid on a goal. All this in 21 minutes.<br> <strong>Weak link:</strong> Charlton have conceded relatively few goals from crosses this season - only 6 - but today allowed Liverpool to complete 15 of 22 crosses, and score three in the air.<br> <strong>The Edge:</strong> Emile Heskey took 6 attempts on goal, scoring once to kill off a Charlton team who had 56% of net possession.</p> <p><strong>MANCHESTER UNITED 2 - 0 TOTTENHAM</strong></p> <p><strong>Key man:</strong> A goal and assist for Paul Scholes. Interestingly, all his 7 goals this season have been scored at home. <br> <strong>Weak link:</strong> Not a single attempt on goal for the declining Dwight Yorke. <br> <strong>The Edge:</strong> United had 70% of net possession until the opening goal, then dropped a gear, finishing with 60% for the match. United defence has only allowed 6 attempts on target in their last 3 Premiership games.</p> <p><strong>WEST HAM 1 - 0 MIDDLESBROUGH</strong></p> <p><strong>Key man:</strong> Rigobert Song is settling in well. He won 12 of 15 challenges, completed 17 of 21 passes, and made 13 clearances.<br> <strong>Weak link:</strong> Boro strikers Noel Whelan and Brian Deane did not produce a single attempt on target. <br> <strong>The Edge:</strong> The Hammers cruised to their win, more than doubling Boro's totals in attempts and crosses (22 to 5). And not enough is being said and written about Stuart Pearce: he had another battling afternoon, winning 22 of 25 challenges, and making 16 clearances.</p>",

Weak link: Despite a wealth of attempts, 419 minutes of scoreless football has seriously damaged the Gunners' title aspirations. The Edge: Arsenal defenders won 51 of 55 challenges and allowed only 1 shot on target. Patrick Vieira won 9 of his 10 challenges in midfield. ASTON VILLA 1 - 1 NEWCASTLE Key man: Warren Barton won 17 of 19 challenges, made 8 clearances and intercepted the ball 3 times. Weak link: With no natural strikers, Newcastle produced only a single attempt on goal. Meanwhile, David Ginola had a bit of a nightmare: 18 of his 37 passes went to opposition players. The Edge: Villa will be feeling unlucky, having made 13 attempts and accurate crosses to Newcastle's 3. But the visitors made up with a battling edge - 131 challenges to Villa's 84 and 22 fouls to Villa's 14. BRADFORD 2 - 1 COVENTRY Key man: Dean Windass completed 42 of 55 passes - 18 of 23 in the forward zone - won 11 of 13 challenges and set up the equaliser. Weak link: Despite a five-man midfield, Coventry had only 42% of net possession. The Edge: Bradford were the keener chasers, making 157 challenges to Coventry's 81. Robert Molenaar added stability to Bradford's defence, winning 21 of 24 challenges and making 11 clearances. IPSWICH 0 - 1 DERBY Key man: Seth Johnson won all his 15 tackles, made 5 clearances and set up the winner for Rory Delap. Weak link: David Johnson and Marcus Stewart had only two attempts on goal and failed to exploit Ipswich's dominance - the home team had 75% of net possession. The Edge: Derby battled hard, making 130 challenges to 64 by Ipswich. Chris Riggott and Horacio Carbonari won 42 of 46 challenges and made 30 clearances, as Derby kept their fourth clean sheet in five matches - in that time, they've only conceded to Manchester United! LEICESTER 3 - 1 LEEDS Key man: Neil Lennon won 12 of 19 challenges, and was accurate in 51 of 58 passes, including 11 of 11 in attacking third. Weak link: Only 7 of 35 Leeds crosses found a team-mate. The Edge: Leicester had 9 attempts in first half, 8 of which were on target: three found the back of the net. Leicester also had more bite in the tackle: they attempted 178 challenges to 99 by Leeds. Harry Kewell, in 30 minutes of long-awaited return, completed 9 of 12 passes, won only 2 of 6 challenges, and had 2 attempts at goal, both off target. LIVERPOOL 3 - 0 CHARLTON Key man: Vladimir Smicer completed 12 of 13 passes, 4 of 4 crosses, had a shot and laid on a goal. All this in 21 minutes. Weak link: Charlton have conceded relatively few goals from crosses this season - only 6 - but today allowed Liverpool to complete 15 of 22 crosses, and score three in the air. The Edge: Emile Heskey took 6 attempts on goal, scoring once to kill off a Charlton team who had 56% of net possession. MANCHESTER UNITED 2 - 0 TOTTENHAM Key man: A goal and assist for Paul Scholes. Interestingly, all his 7 goals this season have been scored at home. Weak link: Not a single attempt on goal for the declining Dwight Yorke. The Edge: United had 70% of net possession until the opening goal, then dropped a gear, finishing with 60% for the match. United defence has only allowed 6 attempts on target in their last 3 Premiership games. WEST HAM 1 - 0 MIDDLESBROUGH Key man: Rigobert Song is settling in well. He won 12 of 15 challenges, completed 17 of 21 passes, and made 13 clearances. Weak link: Boro strikers Noel Whelan and Brian Deane did not produce a single attempt on target. The Edge: The Hammers cruised to their win, more than doubling Boro's totals in attempts and crosses (22 to 5). And not enough is being said and written about Stuart Pearce: he had another battling afternoon, winning 22 of 25 challenges, and making 16 clearances.",

Mersey TV and founder Phil Redmond have developed a reputation for putting on explosive event storylines.

      "trailText": "<p>French actress Emmanuelle B\u00e9art tells <strong>Stuart Jeffries</strong> why she has turned her back on Hollywood.</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Emmanuelle B\u00e9art lights a cigarette and wraps her famous lips around it. Those lips about which I have been advised to ask no questions - certainly none with the word \"collagen\" in them. She inhales sharply, exhales poutingly and then turns to face me across the table at her publicist's Paris flat. </p> <p>\"It was a strange mixture of a woman who is like porcelain and, at the same time, anchored in the ground,\" she says. B\u00e9art is talking about Pauline, the character she plays in her new film, Les Destin\u00e9es Sentimentales. But she might also be talking about herself. She looks like porcelain, with her long, thin, elegant neck, slender figure and large grey-blue eyes. </p> <p>Like her fellow French actress Isabelle Adjani, B\u00e9art is ludicrously, even frostily, beautiful - despite her nondescript sweater, dubious feather cut (with its unfortunate fringe), and lack of make-up. I can't help looking at her, not necessarily with desire, but with astonishment to be confronted with someone so exceptionally good-looking. </p> <p>Les Destin\u00e9es Sentimentales is an adaptation by the accomplished French director Olivier Assayas of Jacques Chardonne's epic novel set in the Charente region of France over a 30-year period straddling the first world war. It's a very difficult book to adapt for the screen, not least because it has two focuses. </p> <p>First, there is a topically resonant story of the march of mass production and how this affects porcelain and cognac, two traditional industries in southwest France. Present day McDonald's-despising peasant campaigners would rightly see in this a critique of globalisation. </p> <p>All very important, of course, but the difficulty Assayas never really surmounts is not only making these issues interesting on screen, but wedding them to the other focus - the story of Protestant pastor Jean (played by Charles Berling), whose marriage to the viperous, damaged Nathalie (played wonderfully by Isabelle Huppert) is falling apart. In the middle of this torment, Jean glimpses Pauline across a crowded ballroom and sees in her the possibility of happiness. Their subsequent 30-year relationship follows B\u00e9art from dewy-eyed ingenue to mature woman in a grey-haired wig. It's an unlikely role for B\u00e9art to have taken on, because it requires a very modest performance. \"I was afraid I wouldn't have the humility necessary to play the role of a woman who is only the wife of someone,\" she says. \"I've played lots of roles that were excessive, women in the fires of passion. </p> <p>\"I found Pauline by abandoning myself to what Olivier wanted. In the ball scene near the very start of the film, I am playing Pauline aged 20. Now I'm 36, so I had to try to recall how I was at 18 years old, when I first fell in love. But it was mannered. \"Then Olivier said: 'This really isn't it at all.' It upset me and I went and stood in the corner with my fists clenched. But he was right. What he wanted was for Charles Berling and I to create something on the spot, rather than falling back on old tricks. I had to abandon all of those.\" </p> <p>B\u00e9art lives in Paris with her partner, David Moreau, and her two children, eight-year-old Nelly and four-year-old Johan. Nelly's dad is the French actor Daniel Auteuil, with whom B\u00e9art had a decade-long relationship. She tries to be private but, in France at least, she often fails. \"The press follow me. I sue them. That's the deal,\" she says. She has been an ambassador for Unicef, and, more controversially, has lent her name to protests against anti-immigration legislation. </p> <p>As an actress, too, she tries to portray herself as anchored, a scrupulous performer who takes succour from the hard work necessary to create a character. In this she's like Robert de Niro, though less butch. He learned to play the saxophone before starring as a jazz musician in Martin Scorsese's New York, New York. Similarly, in preparation for her performance in Claude Sautet's 1992 film Un Coeur En Hiver, she practised the violin for three hours a day for 18 months. </p> <p>But, unlike the truculent De Niro, she can talk about what she does in sentences. \"I have a sense of work, a sense of duty and of things well done,\" she says, and her description of how she approached the part of Pauline is suggestive. \"When I was preparing for this role, I never looked in the mirror. I had no notion of what I looked like. Let the others do the light, the hair, the make-up. The light is elsewhere: the light is in me.\" How extraordinary that an actress so renowned for her beauty should not look in the mirror for guidance. </p> <p>Similarly, she doesn't like to see her old films. Why? Another drag and a pouting exhale. \"I don't know. Because they're part of the past. I don't see my old films, but I think of the characters I played as friends, like the women I meet in my life who made strong impressions on me. I remember them and they are part of me.\" </p> <p>And what a cast of characters they would be if they met for drinks and nibbles. There would be the girl she played aged 10 in her screen debut, a low-budget sci-fi drama called Demain Les M\u00f4mes (Tomorrow the Kids), about a group of children living in the aftermath of a nuclear holocaust. There would be the vengeful, enigmatic mountain girl of Claude Berri's 1986 Manon des Sources. There would be the recalcitrant artist's model from Jacques Rivette's 1991 film La Belle Noiseuse, a four-hour picture in which she was mostly nude, while Michel Piccoli's dubious painter did her picture, his creative (and no doubt other) juices flowing once more after years of liquidity problems. </p> <p>There would also be several characters she probably wouldn't count as friends, English-speaking ones mostly, but some characters from her early 1980s soft-porn flicks, too. And there would be a great many sophisticated Frenchwomen whom she would clasp proudly to her bosom - the violinist in Un Coeur En Hiver, the sensual amanuensis in Sautet's Nelly and Monsieur Arnaud, the love-torn woman in R\u00e9gis Wargnier's 1995 melodrama Une Femme Fran\u00e7aise. </p> <p>It has been some career. But these are just memories. Now Emmanuelle has become Pauline, so much so that the actress who incarnated her has disappeared entirely. \"When I do an interview it always has the resonance of the character I have just played. I've been speaking to you as Pauline. If we do another interview, no doubt I'll be speaking like another character.\" </p> <p>That old ruse: the professional actress hiding behind her masks. \"I'd like to do an interview with the real Emmanuelle B\u00e9art, please. Perhaps in a month?\" I suggest. She switches from French to English. \"OK. No problem. I'll ask her if she's free,\" she says coquettishly. \"She might not be.\" </p> <p>B\u00e9art speaks English well - most of it learned during her misbegotten dalliance with Anglo-Saxon cinema, which started in 1987 with Date With an Angel.

      "bodyText": "Emmanuelle B\u00e9art lights a cigarette and wraps her famous lips around it. Those lips about which I have been advised to ask no questions - certainly none with the word \"collagen\" in them. She inhales sharply, exhales poutingly and then turns to face me across the table at her publicist's Paris flat. \"It was a strange mixture of a woman who is like porcelain and, at the same time, anchored in the ground,\" she says. B\u00e9art is talking about Pauline, the character she plays in her new film, Les Destin\u00e9es Sentimentales. But she might also be talking about herself. She looks like porcelain, with her long, thin, elegant neck, slender figure and large grey-blue eyes. Like her fellow French actress Isabelle Adjani, B\u00e9art is ludicrously, even frostily, beautiful - despite her nondescript sweater, dubious feather cut (with its unfortunate fringe), and lack of make-up. I can't help looking at her, not necessarily with desire, but with astonishment to be confronted with someone so exceptionally good-looking. Les Destin\u00e9es Sentimentales is an adaptation by the accomplished French director Olivier Assayas of Jacques Chardonne's epic novel set in the Charente region of France over a 30-year period straddling the first world war. It's a very difficult book to adapt for the screen, not least because it has two focuses. First, there is a topically resonant story of the march of mass production and how this affects porcelain and cognac, two traditional industries in southwest France. Present day McDonald's-despising peasant campaigners would rightly see in this a critique of globalisation. All very important, of course, but the difficulty Assayas never really surmounts is not only making these issues interesting on screen, but wedding them to the other focus - the story of Protestant pastor Jean (played by Charles Berling), whose marriage to the viperous, damaged Nathalie (played wonderfully by Isabelle Huppert) is falling apart. In the middle of this torment, Jean glimpses Pauline across a crowded ballroom and sees in her the possibility of happiness. Their subsequent 30-year relationship follows B\u00e9art from dewy-eyed ingenue to mature woman in a grey-haired wig. It's an unlikely role for B\u00e9art to have taken on, because it requires a very modest performance. \"I was afraid I wouldn't have the humility necessary to play the role of a woman who is only the wife of someone,\" she says. \"I've played lots of roles that were excessive, women in the fires of passion. \"I found Pauline by abandoning myself to what Olivier wanted. In the ball scene near the very start of the film, I am playing Pauline aged 20. Now I'm 36, so I had to try to recall how I was at 18 years old, when I first fell in love. But it was mannered. \"Then Olivier said: 'This really isn't it at all.' It upset me and I went and stood in the corner with my fists clenched. But he was right. What he wanted was for Charles Berling and I to create something on the spot, rather than falling back on old tricks. I had to abandon all of those.\" B\u00e9art lives in Paris with her partner, David Moreau, and her two children, eight-year-old Nelly and four-year-old Johan. Nelly's dad is the French actor Daniel Auteuil, with whom B\u00e9art had a decade-long relationship. She tries to be private but, in France at least, she often fails. \"The press follow me. I sue them. That's the deal,\" she says. She has been an ambassador for Unicef, and, more controversially, has lent her name to protests against anti-immigration legislation. As an actress, too, she tries to portray herself as anchored, a scrupulous performer who takes succour from the hard work necessary to create a character. In this she's like Robert de Niro, though less butch. He learned to play the saxophone before starring as a jazz musician in Martin Scorsese's New York, New York. Similarly, in preparation for her performance in Claude Sautet's 1992 film Un Coeur En Hiver, she practised the violin for three hours a day for 18 months. But, unlike the truculent De Niro, she can talk about what she does in sentences. \"I have a sense of work, a sense of duty and of things well done,\" she says, and her description of how she approached the part of Pauline is suggestive. \"When I was preparing for this role, I never looked in the mirror. I had no notion of what I looked like. Let the others do the light, the hair, the make-up. The light is elsewhere: the light is in me.\" How extraordinary that an actress so renowned for her beauty should not look in the mirror for guidance. Similarly, she doesn't like to see her old films. Why? Another drag and a pouting exhale. \"I don't know. Because they're part of the past. I don't see my old films, but I think of the characters I played as friends, like the women I meet in my life who made strong impressions on me. I remember them and they are part of me.\" And what a cast of characters they would be if they met for drinks and nibbles. There would be the girl she played aged 10 in her screen debut, a low-budget sci-fi drama called Demain Les M\u00f4mes (Tomorrow the Kids), about a group of children living in the aftermath of a nuclear holocaust. There would be the vengeful, enigmatic mountain girl of Claude Berri's 1986 Manon des Sources. There would be the recalcitrant artist's model from Jacques Rivette's 1991 film La Belle Noiseuse, a four-hour picture in which she was mostly nude, while Michel Piccoli's dubious painter did her picture, his creative (and no doubt other) juices flowing once more after years of liquidity problems. There would also be several characters she probably wouldn't count as friends, English-speaking ones mostly, but some characters from her early 1980s soft-porn flicks, too. And there would be a great many sophisticated Frenchwomen whom she would clasp proudly to her bosom - the violinist in Un Coeur En Hiver, the sensual amanuensis in Sautet's Nelly and Monsieur Arnaud, the love-torn woman in R\u00e9gis Wargnier's 1995 melodrama Une Femme Fran\u00e7aise. It has been some career. But these are just memories. Now Emmanuelle has become Pauline, so much so that the actress who incarnated her has disappeared entirely. \"When I do an interview it always has the resonance of the character I have just played. I've been speaking to you as Pauline. If we do another interview, no doubt I'll be speaking like another character.\" That old ruse: the professional actress hiding behind her masks. \"I'd like to do an interview with the real Emmanuelle B\u00e9art, please. Perhaps in a month?\" I suggest. She switches from French to English. \"OK. No problem. I'll ask her if she's free,\" she says coquettishly. \"She might not be.\" B\u00e9art speaks English well - most of it learned during her misbegotten dalliance with Anglo-Saxon cinema, which started in 1987 with Date With an Angel. It continued with Brian De Palma's Mission: Impossible in 1996, in which she played Tom Cruise's moll. For an actress who had by then played many meaty, mature roles, this seemed a barmy choice - made stranger because Juliette Binoche and Anne Parillaud had (understandably) turned it down as too demeaning. Her peformance got a real pasting. \"Mission: Impossible was really a curiosity for me,\" says B\u00e9art. \"I always say 'Why not?'

In an open letter to the government, <strong>Tom Gutteridge</strong>, <strong>Denise O'Donoghue</strong>, <strong>Jimmy Mulville</strong>, <strong>Charles Brand</strong> and <strong>Paul Smith</strong> argue that it is the producers who put the creative into \"creative industry\".</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The publication of the communications white paper is just a few days away, and we hope that the government has got its priorities right. If the intention is to support and encourage the growth of Britain's creative industries, it needs to make sure it knows what a creative industry really is. In the area of television, successive administrations have got it badly wrong. </p> <p>In the past, the term \"television industry\" has been synonymous with \"broadcasting\". Of course, broadcasters have always been the lifeblood of the television producer. They broadcast what we create and reap rewards from our programmes, either in advertising revenue or, in the case of the BBC, in the millions of viewers who tune in and justify the licence fee. </p> <p>But although many broadcasters have successful producing arms, a broadcaster's primary task is to sit in the distribution chain, not drive the creative hub. That's our responsibility - both independent and in-house producers. We believe that the government should understand that there is a distinction between the generators of creative property (the producers, some of whom are also broadcasters) and the media distributors. </p> <p>Media distribution includes publishing, internet, narrowcasting and the many forms of new media. If the government wants to support television's \"creative industry\" it needs first to look to the content generators; from our success and strength everything else will flow - better programmes, international sales and creative diversity. </p> <p>We need to look at the ways in which Britain, as a centre of the English-speaking world, can take advantage of the massive worldwide increase in demand for creative media - currently the world's fastest expanding industry. </p> <p>To use the language of the 1998 Competition Act, broadcasters in the UK are in a dominant market position. As a result, they have a legal responsibility to avoid abuse of that position. When we produce programmes for ITV we use an agreed terms of trade which was approved by both the office of fair trading and the then monopolies and mergers commission. </p> <p>We are thus more than happy with the current ITV Network Centre arrangements, whereby independent producers and ITV companies retain all the rights to their productions beyond the ITV broadcast. The ITV viewers get the programmes, ITV companies get the ad revenue and we get the chance to exploit our brands both here and overseas. </p> <p>This environment can create phenomenal success, as the international and domestic exploitation of Who Wants To Be a Millionaire? proves. Indeed, the successful indies have demonstrated beyond question that they are more than capable of distributing, reformatting, merchandising and, in short, creating successful enterprises from our creative inventions. </p> <p>Sadly, it is only on ITV where we enjoy these terms: no wonder, really, for these terms of trade were designed to suit both the independents and the ITV companies' own producers. Elsewhere, the broadcasters have insisted on obtaining all rights in programmes in exchange for the commission. </p> <p>Now many of us enjoy excellent relationships with our commissioners. But when it comes to negotiating our rights contracts, we still encounter real resistance. It's hard to understand why. Independent producers like us are seeking to embrace the new media opportunities not just by creating television programmes, but also by developing and managing media brands derived from the intellectual property that we, after all, created in the first place. </p> <p>Of course, the broadcast television programme is often the most important derivative (and can drive brand exploitation in other media), but usually other \"products\" (video, publishing, pay per view, merchandising, internet) are substantially more lucrative extensions of the same brand than the original terrestrial broadcast. These brand derivatives can generate significant new revenues for the television industry, for the benefit of broadcasters, producers and distributors. If only we could be allowed to exploit them. </p> <p>For years now, the BBC and Channel 4 have tried wherever possible to control all rights in a programme \"brand\" (including copyright, distribution rights, trademarks, secondary rights and other rights not directly connected to broadcasting) when in fact all they have really needed is a right to broadcast. </p> <p>Most independents have been unable to do anything about it: they find it hard to retain ownership or to control rights in the programmes they produce, or even in the underlying ideas and formats they have created. </p> <p>This is unfair, and it is also costing Britain dearly. Millions of pounds worth of inward investment and exports are lost as a result. The broadcast programme pays only a token gross margin to the producer (usually a margin of between 6 and 12%) from which the producer has to fund central overheads, research and development of new programmes, international development and exploitation and other costs. That's why the creative industry is scarcely an industry at all. </p> <p>If other means of brand development are denied to producers then we have no way to increase our margin, thus endangering research and development of new programme ideas.

      "bodyText": "The publication of the communications white paper is just a few days away, and we hope that the government has got its priorities right. If the intention is to support and encourage the growth of Britain's creative industries, it needs to make sure it knows what a creative industry really is. In the area of television, successive administrations have got it badly wrong. In the past, the term \"television industry\" has been synonymous with \"broadcasting\". Of course, broadcasters have always been the lifeblood of the television producer. They broadcast what we create and reap rewards from our programmes, either in advertising revenue or, in the case of the BBC, in the millions of viewers who tune in and justify the licence fee. But although many broadcasters have successful producing arms, a broadcaster's primary task is to sit in the distribution chain, not drive the creative hub. That's our responsibility - both independent and in-house producers. We believe that the government should understand that there is a distinction between the generators of creative property (the producers, some of whom are also broadcasters) and the media distributors. Media distribution includes publishing, internet, narrowcasting and the many forms of new media. If the government wants to support television's \"creative industry\" it needs first to look to the content generators; from our success and strength everything else will flow - better programmes, international sales and creative diversity. We need to look at the ways in which Britain, as a centre of the English-speaking world, can take advantage of the massive worldwide increase in demand for creative media - currently the world's fastest expanding industry. To use the language of the 1998 Competition Act, broadcasters in the UK are in a dominant market position. As a result, they have a legal responsibility to avoid abuse of that position. When we produce programmes for ITV we use an agreed terms of trade which was approved by both the office of fair trading and the then monopolies and mergers commission. We are thus more than happy with the current ITV Network Centre arrangements, whereby independent producers and ITV companies retain all the rights to their productions beyond the ITV broadcast. The ITV viewers get the programmes, ITV companies get the ad revenue and we get the chance to exploit our brands both here and overseas. This environment can create phenomenal success, as the international and domestic exploitation of Who Wants To Be a Millionaire? proves. Indeed, the successful indies have demonstrated beyond question that they are more than capable of distributing, reformatting, merchandising and, in short, creating successful enterprises from our creative inventions. Sadly, it is only on ITV where we enjoy these terms: no wonder, really, for these terms of trade were designed to suit both the independents and the ITV companies' own producers. Elsewhere, the broadcasters have insisted on obtaining all rights in programmes in exchange for the commission. Now many of us enjoy excellent relationships with our commissioners. But when it comes to negotiating our rights contracts, we still encounter real resistance. It's hard to understand why. Independent producers like us are seeking to embrace the new media opportunities not just by creating television programmes, but also by developing and managing media brands derived from the intellectual property that we, after all, created in the first place. Of course, the broadcast television programme is often the most important derivative (and can drive brand exploitation in other media), but usually other \"products\" (video, publishing, pay per view, merchandising, internet) are substantially more lucrative extensions of the same brand than the original terrestrial broadcast. These brand derivatives can generate significant new revenues for the television industry, for the benefit of broadcasters, producers and distributors. If only we could be allowed to exploit them. For years now, the BBC and Channel 4 have tried wherever possible to control all rights in a programme \"brand\" (including copyright, distribution rights, trademarks, secondary rights and other rights not directly connected to broadcasting) when in fact all they have really needed is a right to broadcast. Most independents have been unable to do anything about it: they find it hard to retain ownership or to control rights in the programmes they produce, or even in the underlying ideas and formats they have created. This is unfair, and it is also costing Britain dearly. Millions of pounds worth of inward investment and exports are lost as a result. The broadcast programme pays only a token gross margin to the producer (usually a margin of between 6 and 12%) from which the producer has to fund central overheads, research and development of new programmes, international development and exploitation and other costs. That's why the creative industry is scarcely an industry at all. If other means of brand development are denied to producers then we have no way to increase our margin, thus endangering research and development of new programme ideas. Our net margin falls to a little over break-even (at best). As a result, very few independents are publicly owned - most recent acquisitions have been by broadcasters, who can only gain from owning ideas factories. We believe that a substantial amount of outside investment would be available for the creative side of the television industry if only intellectual property could be retained by the creators as an automatic right. This new money could relieve pressure on the licence fee and on advertising revenue. Investors require a return, however, and to give them this, the independent sector must be allowed to generate the kind of gross margins available to virtually every commercial enterprise in the world. As no one wants to see the cost of production rise, the only way to achieve this is to allow the independents to own, control and exploit their own brands. This would immediately result in city and international investment in our creative sector; a substantial increase in income from international sales and licensing of rights overseas; and the beginnings of a competitive and thriving secondary television market. We fail to see how this would disadvantage the broadcasters. When broadcasters control the rights in an independent production, nine times out of 10 they are not focused on, nor capable of, fully exploiting brands as well as the producing company. They have no financial imperative (as they currently do not need the revenues for their survival); their concern is to build their own brand, rather than the programme's; their distribution arms are flooded with programmes and rights most of which they have little interest in exploiting; many producers do it better and more efficiently - we have a passion and a hunger which no broadcaster could ever match. We know that the generation of additional revenue is essential to the future survival of the BBC, and that the licence payer deserves to benefit from exploitation of programmes which the licence fee has funded.

But the boot is now firmly on the other foot.

It dates back to Roman times. In Victorian Britain it was commonplace. And there were questions in parliament about candidates' expenditure being too lavish during the 19th century.</p> <p>But modern political campaigning began in earnest the United States after the second world war. In 1948 a leading American businessman offered the Republican presidential candidate, Thomas Dewey, a complete, professional campaign for the first time using television as well as all other media. Dewey rejected the offer - and lost. These two facts may, or may not, have been connected. It was a risk General Eisenhower, the Republican candidate four years later, was unwilling to take. Using heavy advertising, based on the catchy slogan \"I like Ike\", Eisenhower romped home. Afterwards Rosser Reeves, the chairman of Ike's advertising agency, boasted: \"If only Dewey had used these advertising techniques he too would have been president.\" That was neither honest nor truthful. Eisenhower was a sure-fire winner, Dewey an almost equally certain loser.</p> <p>Politicians, however, are rarely interested in such subtleties. They fell for Reeves's boast hook, line and pollster. The era of all singing and dancing political razzmatazz had arrived. But while Ike's slogan was positive, today most political advertising is depressingly negative.

Often it is primarily intended to hearten established supporters and reassure wobblers. There is no better way of rallying your own troops, as generals have always known, than by vilifying the enemy.</p> <p>In politics this is relatively easy, not least because the Advertising Standards Authority has always refused to control election campaigns on the grounds that this would constitute interfering with the democratic process. And anyway it takes time to prove ads untruthful. So what could the ASA do?

Yet they relentlessly go on using them. So politicians must be convinced they work - but nobody knows for sure. Focus groups and other research techniques are used increasingly, but they are far from foolproof. In the authoritative 15-year study How Voters Decide, by Hilde Himmelweit, Patrick Humphreys and Marianne Jaeger, neither the word advertising nor any of its synonyms is mentioned even once.</p> <p>One fundamental difference between political and other advertising lies in its discontinuity. Commercial advertisers can, and do, test their advertising by desisting from it in comparable regions of the country, for measured periods. They can then assess sales in the areas where advertising has continued and in those where it hasn't. Such experiments cannot be carried out at general elections. Even if a party were to stop advertising in some regions and not in others - which would be a brave, not to say suicidal, decision - who can say whether the results would still be applicable in utterly different circumstances five years later?</p> <p>The only known test was carried out some time ago in Illinois, when one candidate deliberately withdrew his advertising in certain areas. It was a local election, the turnout was very low, and Illinois isn't Britain, so the results must be treated with caution.

In a landslide, like our own 1997 election, the advertising was almost certainly irrelevant, a waste of hard cash. But nobody can ever be absolutely sure, in advance, whether an election will be a walkover or a photo-finish. So the politicians have no choice but to go on spending.

When Joan Bakewell quit Heart of the Matter over its ever-later time slot - it was then axed - she sent a shock wave through the faithful. </p> <p>The Bishop of Wakefield's words carry particular force. He sits in the House of Lords and is the head of the general synod's new broadcast monitoring group, which in the New Year will draw together its first report, dwelling on quality, funding and scheduling, not just quantity. </p> <p>In a separate move, the Archbishop's council has just fielded a group of five bishops, including the Bishop of Liverpool, for a frank first meeting with the media. The monitoring is designed to keep independent tabs on religious broadcasting trends, after last February's synod (the governing body of the CoE) gave unanimous backing to a regretful motion, based on a report by ex-BBC producer Nigel Holmes called Losing Faith in the BBC. </p> <p>The key fact unearthed by Holmes was that while hours of output on BBC1 and BBC2 had doubled over the previous 10 years, religious programming had declined by one third. This is not contested by the BBC, though many were puzzled by the report's failure to link this trend to the decline in church attendance in this country and by the cleanish bill of health it gave to ITV. </p> <p>Nor is it a purely Church of England matter any more. Neville Nagler, director general of the British Board of Deputies, says: \"Religious output? It's a bit thin. There is a growth in interest in society in spiritual matters. But this is not being reflected by the broadcasters.\" The huge debates sparked by the plight of the conjoined twins and the murder of Damilola Taylor are just the most recent examples. </p> <p>Dr Jim McDonnell, director of the Catholic Communications Centre in London, who welcomes the CoE initiative provided it's not purely negative, similarly observes that BBC television is \"weak in religious news coverage\".</p> <p> Religious correspondent Emily Buchanan, he says, \"finds it hard to get stories onto the news agenda. Religion is an important area of life. There could be much more insight into the connection between religion and politics in the rest of the world. The BBC has the resources, with the World Service, yet the coverage of Islam really upsets Muslims, it is so stereotyped.\" </p> <p>This autumn BBC1's Everyman series was whisked in a twinkling of an eye from Sunday to Tuesday evenings, to make way for Panorama. Everyman editor Ruth Pitt insists it is flourishing in its post-10.30pm slot, and says she has been charged with devising a broad range of ethical programmes, including a series for next autumn on ... Islam. </p> <p>Yet since the synod's vote, BBC director of television Mark Thompson has questioned, in his Banff speech, whether it will make sense in the future to guarantee a slot for all the BBC's \"less popular\" genres on BBC1. Thompson says he has not received a single complaint about moving Everyman and, with BBC1's new strategy settled, all religious programmes are being looked at. It might move again, to BBC2 (in a more accessible 9pm slot). </p> <p>The real issue is that in an entertainment-driven BBC1, religion must earn audiences. \"There is no market at all for bad religious broadcasting,\" says the Bishop of Liverpool. Seeing Salvation, the BBC2 series exploring artists' depiction of Christ, wins high praise from everyone interviewed. </p> <p>The ongoing debate stirred up by Holmes is the subject of a measured essay (Religious Broadcasting on UK Television) published this week in Cultural Trends. Author Rachel Viney suggests that the BBC should make a declaration of intent, since its obligations are currently vague. She proposes a package including commitments on: the types of programmes viewers can expect; how the responsibilities are divided between television and radio; and clarification of how religious programmes are defined. Thompson says he'll consider what she says. </p> <p>With the communications white paper due next week, promising lighter touch regulation, ITV confirms it is lobbying to have the requirement to screen religious programmes - historically written into ITV licences - dropped from the wording of the new act. </p> <p>Remember, if you're allergic to religion, that children's programmes were written into the 1990 Broadcasting Act at the same time as the religious obligation. \"We're in a multi-channel age of streamed services but the majority are not there yet,\" says Jocelyn Hay, chair of Voice of the Listener &amp; Viewer. \"Chris Smith keeps talking about lighter regulation.

      "bodyText": "The bishops of the Church of England will be laying aside their Bibles this Advent and scanning the text of the Radio Times instead. \"The broadcasters know we expect to see the same quality and quantity of religious broadcasting over Christmas and the New Year, which was so welcome over the millennium,\" warns the Bishop of Wakefield, the Right Rev Nigel McCulloch. \"You don't have a feeling there is anyone in the BBC championing these programmes,\" says the Bishop of Liverpool, the Right Rev James Jones. \"It is incumbent on public service broadcasters to provide proper funding and places in the schedules.\" Last year, a bumper Songs of Praise with 60,000 trusty singers brought joy to the bishops - but also fanned the flames of disquiet because it showed what a power religious television can still be on BBC1. When Joan Bakewell quit Heart of the Matter over its ever-later time slot - it was then axed - she sent a shock wave through the faithful. The Bishop of Wakefield's words carry particular force. He sits in the House of Lords and is the head of the general synod's new broadcast monitoring group, which in the New Year will draw together its first report, dwelling on quality, funding and scheduling, not just quantity. In a separate move, the Archbishop's council has just fielded a group of five bishops, including the Bishop of Liverpool, for a frank first meeting with the media. The monitoring is designed to keep independent tabs on religious broadcasting trends, after last February's synod (the governing body of the CoE) gave unanimous backing to a regretful motion, based on a report by ex-BBC producer Nigel Holmes called Losing Faith in the BBC. The key fact unearthed by Holmes was that while hours of output on BBC1 and BBC2 had doubled over the previous 10 years, religious programming had declined by one third. This is not contested by the BBC, though many were puzzled by the report's failure to link this trend to the decline in church attendance in this country and by the cleanish bill of health it gave to ITV. Nor is it a purely Church of England matter any more. Neville Nagler, director general of the British Board of Deputies, says: \"Religious output? It's a bit thin. There is a growth in interest in society in spiritual matters. But this is not being reflected by the broadcasters.\" The huge debates sparked by the plight of the conjoined twins and the murder of Damilola Taylor are just the most recent examples. Dr Jim McDonnell, director of the Catholic Communications Centre in London, who welcomes the CoE initiative provided it's not purely negative, similarly observes that BBC television is \"weak in religious news coverage\". Religious correspondent Emily Buchanan, he says, \"finds it hard to get stories onto the news agenda. Religion is an important area of life. There could be much more insight into the connection between religion and politics in the rest of the world. The BBC has the resources, with the World Service, yet the coverage of Islam really upsets Muslims, it is so stereotyped.\" This autumn BBC1's Everyman series was whisked in a twinkling of an eye from Sunday to Tuesday evenings, to make way for Panorama. Everyman editor Ruth Pitt insists it is flourishing in its post-10.30pm slot, and says she has been charged with devising a broad range of ethical programmes, including a series for next autumn on ... Islam. Yet since the synod's vote, BBC director of television Mark Thompson has questioned, in his Banff speech, whether it will make sense in the future to guarantee a slot for all the BBC's \"less popular\" genres on BBC1. Thompson says he has not received a single complaint about moving Everyman and, with BBC1's new strategy settled, all religious programmes are being looked at. It might move again, to BBC2 (in a more accessible 9pm slot). The real issue is that in an entertainment-driven BBC1, religion must earn audiences. \"There is no market at all for bad religious broadcasting,\" says the Bishop of Liverpool. Seeing Salvation, the BBC2 series exploring artists' depiction of Christ, wins high praise from everyone interviewed. The ongoing debate stirred up by Holmes is the subject of a measured essay (Religious Broadcasting on UK Television) published this week in Cultural Trends. Author Rachel Viney suggests that the BBC should make a declaration of intent, since its obligations are currently vague. She proposes a package including commitments on: the types of programmes viewers can expect; how the responsibilities are divided between television and radio; and clarification of how religious programmes are defined. Thompson says he'll consider what she says. With the communications white paper due next week, promising lighter touch regulation, ITV confirms it is lobbying to have the requirement to screen religious programmes - historically written into ITV licences - dropped from the wording of the new act. Remember, if you're allergic to religion, that children's programmes were written into the 1990 Broadcasting Act at the same time as the religious obligation. \"We're in a multi-channel age of streamed services but the majority are not there yet,\" says Jocelyn Hay, chair of Voice of the Listener &amp; Viewer. \"Chris Smith keeps talking about lighter regulation. The commitments to children's programmes and religion were only won after a huge campaign. It is essential they stay.\" Yet Rachel Viney's paper contains a salutary warning about the letter and spirit of the law. Although religious programmes became a legal duty after the 1990 act, there were no rules about scheduling. \"Religious broadcasting is an unfashionable genre,\" says Viney, \"but I feel it is important because it offers people a different take on the world, a chance to think about moral, ethical issues.\" One of ITV's most successful offerings in the genre, The Storykeepers - an animated version of Bible stories - \"came from the requirement to do religious programmes\", she points out. \"But if it's just a case of fulfilling quotas, then quality can be a real problem.\" The key, says Dr McDonnell of the Catholic Communications Centre, is that the \"culture of broadcasting is not lost\" in the new age. \"We have a vibrant broadcasting sector with a public service ethos. You won't get broad-based religious broadcasting unless you have that context.\" As for a requirement in the communications act: \"We still see a place for religious programmes on commercial television and they will not be there without that. Public service broadcasting shouldn't just be impartial news and current affairs. We will fight to have a strong public service dimension. It's worth fighting for.\" Wait for battle to commence.",

But despite differing views over the company's strategy, most people are agreed that Emap Digital Music is finally making moves in the right direction. </p> <p>This week, the Emap Digital Music project team, effectively the new media division of Emap Performance, launched the first of seven planned websites that take the suffix 4music.com. The strategy is still being thrashed out and Performance has not confirmed whether the 4music.com brand will be applied to all its stable of music magazines (Q, Smash Hits, Mojo, Kerrang! and Mixmag) and radio station Kiss. </p> <p>At this stage, Emap is only happy to talk about definite plans for Q, its flagship music magazine which sells almost 200,000 copies each month, and Mojo, which will be given its first website before the end of the year. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.Q4music.com\" target=\"_NEW\">Q4music</a> will replace the token effort that was <a href=\"http://www.Qonline.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">Qonline</a>. Between now and next June (or thereabouts) Jerry Perkins, the man charged with setting up and managing Emap Digital's music sites, is working overtime to them off the ground. He has a tight schedule. By anybody's reckoning, seven sites in seven months is quite a tall order. </p> <p>A partnership with HMV to integrate e-commerce across the sites in the form of \"buyers' guides\" - essentially reviews of the best albums to have in your collection - has given Emap a good platform on which to build sustainable revenue streams. But it's got a lot of lost ground to claw back, given that it is at least two years behind strong competition, such as IPC's <a href=\"http://www.nme.com\" target=\"_NEW\">NME</a> and Miller Freeman's <a href=\"http://www.dotmusic.com\" target=\"_NEW\">Dotmusic</a>. </p> <p>Additionally, the online music market has exploded in the past year with countless new entrants, such as <a href=\"http://www.peoplesound.com\" target=\"_NEW\">Peoplesound</a>, <a href=\"http://www.hobomusic.com\" target=\"_NEW\">Hobomusic</a>, <a href=\"http://www.music3w.com\" target=\"_NEW\">Music3w</a>, <a href=\"http://www.music33.com\" target=\"_NEW\">Music33</a>, <a href=\"http://www.music365.com\" target=\"_NEW\">Music365</a>, <a href=\"http://www.popworld.com\" target=\"_NEW\">Popworld</a> and <a href=\"http://www.worldpop.com\" target=\"_NEW\">Worldpop</a>, all vying for a piece of the action. </p> <p>Q4Music and the other planned Emap Performance sites are steering clear of getting embroiled in the music download market, preferring to be a shop, a source of information, and the odd audio and video clip. </p> <p>As this comes in the wake of Emap slashing its three-year digital investment by 30% to \u00a3120m, the company is a bit sensitive about how the market perceives it is spending its dwindling pot of digital cash. </p> <p>Critics have questioned whether \u00a39m for seven websites over a three-year period is enough to give Performance the online businesses it wants, particularly if it is not going to spend heavily on marketing, preferring instead to leave the promotion of the websites to its offline media properties. </p> <p>Perkins insists the quiet way is the right way. \"We're already reaching 30% [3m] of all active music consumers through our magazines, so there's no point running a large above-the-line ad campaign. We're not here to spend, we're here to build sites.\" </p> <p>However, one observer makes the point that unless Emap makes some marketing investment in non-Emap media then it could end up just shouting to those who are already converted fans. \"The danger is that it will fail to attract new audiences because there are so many other music websites out there. The extreme case is that it may start to cannibalise its offline audience. You have to try to grow the market and go beyond existing boundaries.\" </p> <p>Mark O'Donoghue, chief operating officer at dotmusic.com, questions the fragmented approach. \"It's quite a good looking site but it's not enough on its own. Emap should be able to drive all Q's existing readers to the site but I'm not sure to what degree it plans to redirect traffic between all the different sites. It could end up remaining a fragment ed experience.\" </p> <p>The main criticism coming from the industry is targeted at Emap Performance's late entry into the online market. Perkins acknowledges that the music titles have been slow to take advantage of the opportunity offered by the market, but says there's still time. \"We know we haven't got first mover advantage, so what we're aiming for is first prover advantage where we fuse great editorial with recommendations of what to buy.\" </p> <p>Neil Robinson, media network director at NME.com, is convinced Emap will have its work cut out because of its lateness to market. \"It's far more saturated than it was four years ago and the job is going to be made even harder because they're trying to build new, separate brands, rather than doing what we did and building the strongest brand into an umbrella brand.\" NME.com, which was recently relaunched, claims it reaches some 1.3m unique users a month. </p> <p>Ben Drury, head of music at <a href=\"http://www.btopenworld.com\" target=\"_NEW\">BTOpenworld</a> and part of the launch team on dotmusic, agrees that the brand extensions using the 4music.com moniker could be more trouble than they're worth. \"Emap might be better served joining the titles together online,\" he says. Asked whether he thinks Emap's delay in launching strong online music properties will count against it, Drury replies: \"It's too little, too late. There's not much room left in the online music space for new entrants. </p> <p>\"Q4Music is a site that underwhelms me as there's nothing on there that other sites haven't already done, and a real lack of rich media. It should have been up there two years ago. After all this time and after the mess that was Qonline, I would have hoped that Emap would break new ground.\" </p> <p>In contrast, Ernesto Schmitt, president of peoplesound.com, agrees with the team at Emap. \"It's not too late as there's still a dearth of quality editorial on the net. While there is too much content online, what's lacking is properly managed editorial.\" Implicitly recognising this, Emap has pulled in heavyweight music journalist Paul Du Noyer, a former Q and Mojo editor, who moved across the group earlier this year to take on the job of editorial director of the Emap Digital music project. </p> <p>Du Noyer is full of the right buzzwords, saying he wants the sites to be \"great knowledge, lightly worn\" and that the fusion of \"editorial\" (he has banned the word content) and commerce should be like \"oil and water\" because the two cannot really be mixed without compromising objectivity. </p> <p>Du Noyer is keen to point out that even though the USP of the planned music sites will be the buyers' guides, his emphasis remains on integrity. \"We'll have the edge over retail sites as our philosophy is that it's quality, not content. We've been in the market for 20 years and we know about good editorial. It's time to take this learning online.\" </p> <p>One of the plans intended to add a sense of community to Q4music, in addition to the ubiquitous chatrooms, votes, crosswords and classifieds, is to build on the personalities of Q writers, giving them their own home pages. </p> <p>One of the main strengths of the site will be the widely-respected album reviews, of which a database of 20,000 has been built for launch. Around 20% of site content will be taken from Performance's magazines with the newly recruited online editorial teams developing the rest. </p> <p>While Emap is at pains to emphasise editorial integrity, rivals have raised a few eyebrows on hearing of its strategy to be the \"greatest music buyers' guide in the world\". </p> <p>Robinson of NME.com says: \"I'm not entirely convinced by the retail/media hybrid model. E-commerce is an important factor in driving revenues but the main thing is to excite and entertain music fans, and then let them decide whether they wish to go on to buy relevant products.\" </p> <p>Drury of BTOpenworld agrees. \"There's a fine line between editorial integrity and commercialism. By diluting editorial into a shopping experience, it could be seen to threaten the integrity of the reviews. From my experience, the best way to drive sales is through clever integration with content.\" </p> <p>Defending Emap again, Schmitt from peoplesound.com says the buyers' guides are a sensible move but that it is important to dovetail them with quality editorial. Like other potential competitors, he welcomes the entry of Emap into the market, saying the more the merrier given that a lot of the smaller players will not survive the shake-out. </p> <p>Robinson says he looks forward to Q and the likes of Mojo being in the same market, and dotmusic.com's O'Donoghue is glad Emap is finally here, despite his concern that the lack of consolidation in its strategy could be confusing for consumers. </p> <p>The bottom line seems to be that Emap stands as good a chance as any other online music player that has recently hit the market.

Ralph Bernard, GWR chief executive, will head the programming division, with a brief to ensure the firm's content is rolled out on to all appropriate distribution platforms. Classic FM managing director Roger Lewis is to take responsibility for all commercial activities, including growing audiences for existing GWR services and extending the company's on-air brands into new revenue areas. Steve Orchard, GWR group operations and programming director, is to head a new UK Local Radio division focusing on acquisitions and integration in anticipation of the relaxation of ownership rules in the communications white paper. Mr Orchard's programming deputy, Dirk Anthony, has been appointed group programme director, responsible for the UK, and Wayne Lowery is to become local radio sales director within this division. GWR's digital and new media operations are to be consolidated into one division under commercial director Simon Ward. Mr Ward, who already heads GWR new media unit ecast Ventures, will be responsible for identifying potentially profitable initiatives. Patrick Taylor, GWR deputy chief executive, will take on additional responsibility as head of the newly-created human resources division. GWR is also creating three new boards to oversee this new structure. Mr Bernard is to chair the programming board, with Mr Lewis heading the commercial board and Mr Patrick overseeing the human resources board. Mr Bernard said: \"The new structure emphasises the three pillars on which our business is built: our programming success, our commercial customers and the people who work for us. The new boards will encourage rapid reaction to changes and opportunities in the key areas of our business.\"",

As he received a lifetime achievement award from the European Film Academy, Harris used his acceptance speech to take a swipe at the British film industry for failing to give him a similar honour. The 70-year-old Hollywood star, known for his youthful hellraising as much as his performances in films including Camelot, This Sporting Life and more recently Gladiator, said he was thrilled and humbled and hoped the sight of his trophy might jog a few British memories. Collecting the award at a glittering ceremony in Paris, Harris said: \"I want to congratulate you on choosing me. It is something that the British Academy [of Film and Television Arts] has failed to do annually.\" He grumbled: \"It is always the French. I got best actor at Cannes but the British seem to have forgotten me. Maybe now they will remember me.\" No doubt Harris felt he had the last laugh as the British contingent left the event empty handed. The box office hit Billy Elliot went unrecognised despite being tipped for a hat-trick of awards; it was seen as a hot contender for best film, with 14-year-old star Jamie Bell and his co-star Julie Walters nominated in the best actor and best actress categories. The British animator Nick Park's first feature film, Chicken Run, was also defeated in the best film category as the Danish director Lars von Trier repeated his Cannes triumph with Dancer in the Dark. Park's leading lady, pop star Bjork, was named best actress. Frenchman Sergi Lopez was named best actor for his performance in Harry, He's Here to Help, while the French action hero Jean Reno and Italian actor-director Roberto Benigni, best known for his film Life is Beautiful, shared the European Achievement in World Cinema Award 2000. The European Film Awards were created in 1988 as a counterpart to the Oscars. This year's ceremony was hosted by the actor Rupert Everett and television presenter Antoine de Caunes.",

Sure, they get letters and emails from irate readers. But how many people actually looked at that in-depth analysis they slaved over for two days? Well, I can tell you. One of the key features of editing a website is the ability to find out exactly how many people look at every page on the network.

So, as you read this, our US election race report is probably the biggest news section on the site (unless something more interesting has happened since). Of course, once that race is over those impressions will go down markedly. </p> <p>The problem with stats, however, is that you can't take them at face value. If we just ran what was most popular then maybe we would only produce a crossword and some breaking news headlines. But then what would be unique about the site that you couldn't get elsewhere? </p> <p>At the same time, say we put a huge effort into putting an enormous legal judgment on the site to go with a big story, or we've got leaked documents that add authenticity to an investigation - should they go up? Of course. But look at the stats and they might barely feature. </p> <p>Does that matter? The newspaper might print the full text of a significant prime ministerial speech and never know whether a single reader has looked at it. But the editorial reason for putting it there is totally valid - and the same applies online. Often, readers simply like the idea that something is there; that it gives the feeling of depth and mass-information that made people want to come to the site in the first place. A site is surely a sum of its parts - comprising a whole that people like. </p> <p>And what users look at is not always what you might expect. I used to think that people would just automatically look at copy that we produce during the day, simply because of its sheer exclusivity. Of course, that was never the case. People look at what interests them and it's no longer enough simply to have something that's not in the paper. It has to be worth it. </p> <p>There's also the fact that the vast majority of pages viewed are looked at by only a few people. Of course, what it's really about is that people are diverse. A good site should give people tangents to go off and explore on a whim, guiding them with the navigation and links but, more importantly, providing opportunities to pick their way around an increasingly enormous internet. </p> <p>One of the most important skills in editing a paper was always an unerring sense of what the readers want, ensuring that they will come to you because they feel at home. Which is, after all, something developed over hundreds of years of newspaper editing. The simple act of choosing the stories that matter and explaining why they do. </p> <p>Over-reliance on statistics is like relinquishing that role of bothering to find out what your readers want. It's saying that your judgment matters less. Besides being a dereliction of an editor's duty, it's also bound to be commercially suicidal. The reason why personalisation of news has yet to take off is because the majority of users want their news edited. </p> <p>None of this stops me being a slave to the numbers. It's fascinating to see exactly how many impressions a piece that we spent hours putting together actually got. It teaches us what works and what doesn't. But they're useful only up to a point. Beyond that, it's back to good old-fashioned judgment. If you just based your site solely on the stats, why would you need to be an editor to perform your job? A computer could do it much better.</p> <p>\u0095 Simon Rogers is deputy editor of Guardian Unlimited.</p>",

People look at what interests them and it's no longer enough simply to have something that's not in the paper. It has to be worth it. There's also the fact that the vast majority of pages viewed are looked at by only a few people. Of course, what it's really about is that people are diverse. A good site should give people tangents to go off and explore on a whim, guiding them with the navigation and links but, more importantly, providing opportunities to pick their way around an increasingly enormous internet. One of the most important skills in editing a paper was always an unerring sense of what the readers want, ensuring that they will come to you because they feel at home. Which is, after all, something developed over hundreds of years of newspaper editing. The simple act of choosing the stories that matter and explaining why they do. Over-reliance on statistics is like relinquishing that role of bothering to find out what your readers want. It's saying that your judgment matters less. Besides being a dereliction of an editor's duty, it's also bound to be commercially suicidal. The reason why personalisation of news has yet to take off is because the majority of users want their news edited. None of this stops me being a slave to the numbers. It's fascinating to see exactly how many impressions a piece that we spent hours putting together actually got. It teaches us what works and what doesn't. But they're useful only up to a point. Beyond that, it's back to good old-fashioned judgment. If you just based your site solely on the stats, why would you need to be an editor to perform your job? A computer could do it much better. \u0095 Simon Rogers is deputy editor of Guardian Unlimited.",

Home Office officials have told probation officers that around 30 offenders a month are now being identified as potentially dangerous: likely to pose a risk to the public, or in need of protection themselves on release. The new system was put in place in April last year after the high profile release of sex offenders such as Sidney Cooke and Robert Oliver sparked vigilante protests. An early warning system was set up, under which prison and probation authorities and the police advise Home Office ministers of their plans to handle the release of inmates deemed still to be particularly dangerous two months before they are due to leave jail. Although the offenders have finished their sentences they agree to live in probation hostels with specific monitoring and supervision arrangements. But a rise in the number of such dangerous offenders being released from 10 a month when the scheme got under way last year to about 30 a month now is putting it under great strain. Paddy Doyle, a senior official in the Home Office's dangerous offenders unit, last week heard complaints from probation officers that it was becoming increasingly difficult to place all the offenders in appropriate accommodation because of the numbers involved. The number of offenders deemed to be dangerous and living in London has now passed the 900 mark and the new Criminal Justice Act, which reached the statute book on Friday, will place a new duty on police and probation services to make arrangements for assessing and managing all convicted sex criminals and violent offenders on their patch.

London Ambulance Service said he had cuts to his stomach but his condition was stable. </p> <p>Meanwhile a gang of youths aged 10 to 14 has become the focus of the Damilola Taylor investigation. The youths were loitering in Peckham, south London, on the night he was stabbed and bled to death. </p> <p>Witnesses have told Scotland Yard detectives that between six and 10 boys were outside the library where the 10-year-old had joined an after-school computer class last Monday. </p> <p>An anonymous 999 call reported a bottle fight between youths shortly before the time Damilola was attacked, but police officers who went to the scene found no evidence of the incident. </p> <p>Detective Superintendent David Dillnutt said: \"We are still seeking witnesses at the library from about 3.35pm when Damilola arrived. There was a group of youths outside _ this is a particular square where children meet.\" </p> <p>Police believe a woman in a red anorak with a small child was also outside the library, and would be a valuable witness. The fresh appeal for information came following the arrest and release on Saturday of two boys, aged 12 and 13, and a 39-year-old woman. </p> <p>During a press conference yesterday Mr Dillnutt dismissed reports that Damilola's family believed their son, who was born in Nigeria and had moved to the UK four months ago, was being bullied by West Indian youths. \"We have no evidence of this. The family is not saying this is a racial incident or a racist attack. </p> <p>\"We simply do not know if there is a link between the bul lying that had been complained of by Damilola's family and his death.\" </p> <p>Sir John Stevens, the commissioner of the Metropolitan police, acknowledged that there were tensions on the estate where he was killed. </p> <p>\"What is being said is that there is a certain amount of tension between racial groups,\" he told London Weekend Television. \"We must not deny that, but we must also not build that up into a situation where there's more violence.\" </p> <p>Sir John said 70 officers were on the case. </p> <p>All of Damilola's classmates at Oliver Goldsmith primary school have been seen by detectives, and 100 adults have come forward with information. He died in a stairwell on the North Peckham estate minutes after being stabbed in the leg as he walked home. </p> <p>A memorial service for the boy was held yesterday in Peckham. </p> <p>\u0095The government will this week announce plans to ex tend youth curfews to anyone aged up to 16. </p> <p>Local councils and the police have the power to impose curfews on children aged 10 and under. However, this power has not been used on a single occasion in two years. Ministers hope their plans, to be spelt out in the Queen's Speech, will help communities tackle anti-social behaviour. The police have powers to take home anyone believed to be under 16 in an area covered by a curfew order; if no parent is at home, the police can detain the youth overnight. </p> <p>Ministers will also review policy on the carrying of knives by re-examining the Offensive Weapons Act. A knives amnesty following the murder of London teacher Phillip Lawrence in 1995 proved only a partial success. More than 40,000 weapons were handed in, but the number of attacks involving knives has continued to rise. </p> <p><strong>Related stories</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/crime/subsectionmenu/0,5667,-1201987,00.html\">More about the Damilola Taylor case</a></p>",

Witnesses have told Scotland Yard detectives that between six and 10 boys were outside the library where the 10-year-old had joined an after-school computer class last Monday. An anonymous 999 call reported a bottle fight between youths shortly before the time Damilola was attacked, but police officers who went to the scene found no evidence of the incident. Detective Superintendent David Dillnutt said: \"We are still seeking witnesses at the library from about 3.35pm when Damilola arrived. There was a group of youths outside _ this is a particular square where children meet.\" Police believe a woman in a red anorak with a small child was also outside the library, and would be a valuable witness. The fresh appeal for information came following the arrest and release on Saturday of two boys, aged 12 and 13, and a 39-year-old woman. During a press conference yesterday Mr Dillnutt dismissed reports that Damilola's family believed their son, who was born in Nigeria and had moved to the UK four months ago, was being bullied by West Indian youths. \"We have no evidence of this. The family is not saying this is a racial incident or a racist attack. \"We simply do not know if there is a link between the bul lying that had been complained of by Damilola's family and his death.\" Sir John Stevens, the commissioner of the Metropolitan police, acknowledged that there were tensions on the estate where he was killed. \"What is being said is that there is a certain amount of tension between racial groups,\" he told London Weekend Television. \"We must not deny that, but we must also not build that up into a situation where there's more violence.\" Sir John said 70 officers were on the case. All of Damilola's classmates at Oliver Goldsmith primary school have been seen by detectives, and 100 adults have come forward with information. He died in a stairwell on the North Peckham estate minutes after being stabbed in the leg as he walked home. A memorial service for the boy was held yesterday in Peckham. \u0095The government will this week announce plans to ex tend youth curfews to anyone aged up to 16. Local councils and the police have the power to impose curfews on children aged 10 and under. However, this power has not been used on a single occasion in two years. Ministers hope their plans, to be spelt out in the Queen's Speech, will help communities tackle anti-social behaviour. The police have powers to take home anyone believed to be under 16 in an area covered by a curfew order; if no parent is at home, the police can detain the youth overnight. Ministers will also review policy on the carrying of knives by re-examining the Offensive Weapons Act. A knives amnesty following the murder of London teacher Phillip Lawrence in 1995 proved only a partial success. More than 40,000 weapons were handed in, but the number of attacks involving knives has continued to rise. Related stories More about the Damilola Taylor case",

The occupants of both cars died instantly. </p> <p>Road accidents have to be pretty spectacular to attract the attention of national newspapers, but this one was reported at some length by the Daily Telegraph - and with a noticeable lack of detachment and judiciousness. Clearly, the paper could not apportion blame before the police investigation or the inquest. Equally, it had no business trying to arouse its readers' sympathy for some of the people involved, but not the others. Yet that is what it did. </p> <p>Brothers, aged 19 and 22, were in the BMW, and an elderly couple in the Nissan. According to Thames Valley Police, the BMW was spinning out of control when it hit the Nissan and this, together with the fact that the Nissan was propelled backwards for 20 metres, clearly suggests that the BMW was being driven dangerously. </p> <p>But the Telegraph did everything it could to discourage such uncharitable thoughts about the brothers. The headline on the story told us that the younger one had been \"Prince William's schoolmate\" at Eton, though he was not even in the same year. The idea, perhaps, was that by dragging in this irrelevance, some respectability would rub off on him. </p> <p>There were a couple of inconvenient facts that the paper did not overlook: first, the two men had been out all night when the accident happened at 5am (though there was no suggestion that they had been drinking); and second, the headmaster of Eton refused to make any comment, on the grounds that they had not been formally identified. Others, however, felt no such inhibitions, and what they said completely outweighed the headmaster's silence. </p> <p>\"They were both talented and clever,\" according to one friend. \"They were both very popular with everyone around here, and we are all devastated. The way people who knew them have been turning up in tears shows how highly they were regarded. They were great lads. It's a real tragedy and we're all going to miss them.\" </p> <p>But what of the elderly couple in the Nissan? Were they popular and highly regarded? Perhaps, or perhaps not. We do not know, because all the Telegraph told us about them was that they lived in Feltham. Not even their names or their ages. Were poor relations ever as poor as this? </p> <p>It is not often that newspapers publish eulogies of the perpetrators of a crime and say next to nothing about their victims. And it is very unlikely that the Telegraph would have done so in this case if different people had been involved. </p> <p>Just suppose that the Old Etonian had not been one of the brothers, but the man in the Nissan. Suppose that the brothers had not been well educated ex-public schoolboys but half-literate products of the local comprehensive. Would the tearful tributes of their friends have been published in those circumstances? Or would the paper have left it to the reader to conclude that they were a pair of young tearaways whose recklessness had caused the deaths of two innocent people? </p> <p>There is little doubt that this is how the story would have been written, and exactly why the Telegraph's news values were so blatantly inverted is a matter for conjecture. Perhaps it was the Eton connection: Charles Moore, the editor, is an Old Etonian. Perhaps it was the royal connection, slender though it was: the paper seems to become more monarchist every month. Or was it just sloppy journalism? Whatever the reason, it did itself no favours when it reported the Sunningdale accident in such selective and tendentious terms. </p> <p>The managing editor, Susan Ryan, appeared to concede as much when challenged about the story. She said that it could, and should, have been \"more sensitive\". </p> <p>Certainly, one of Ryan's predecessors, the redoubtable Peter Eastwood, would never have allowed such a lopsided and inadequate story to appear in the Telegraph; and he would have prevented it because he knew that Lord Hartwell, the proprietor in those days, insisted on balance and fairness. The paper may have been duller than it is now, but it prided itself on the even-handedness of its news columns. </p> <p>Newspapers, and especially daily newspapers, are not works of perfection: they have to be produced too quickly for that, and they inevitably contain inaccuracies and rough approximations to the truth which would never stand up to forensic attack. Nor would anyone want them to be flavourless fact sheets on the American model. </p> <p>The Telegraph was no less Tory, bourgeois and patriotic 20 years ago than it is today. What has changed is that the paper no longer feels that it has an obligation to its readers to give both sides of the case. For Lord Hartwell this was a matter of duty; for Conrad Black it seems an optional extra, usually ignored. </p> <p>Thus, the Telegraph's hostility to the European Union and most of its activities is not only unremitting, which is obviously legitimate, but is rarely qualified by any countervailing facts. The EU is represented as wholly malign or ridiculous, whereas it is, of course, no different from most other organisations: it has its good and bad points, and what the paper should be doing is helping its readers to strike a reasonable balance. </p> <p>It should also be above the sort of playground abuse that frequently pollutes its business pages. The city editor, Neil Collins, evidently has little time for the trade and industry secretary, Stephen Byers, or the president of the European Central Bank, Wim Duisenberg. But that does not excuse the puerile vulgarity of calling Byers \"Bozo\" and Duisenberg \"Dim Wim\". If Charles Moore cared more for the standing of his paper, he would stamp hard on this. </p> <p>Like its rivals, the Telegraph likes to boast about its commercial performance. Every month it announces how much its circulation exceeds that of the Times, though without any disclosures about how many of its sales are accounted for by cut-price copies. Still less does it remind anyone that not so long ago its circulation was nearly half as big again as it is now. </p> <p>Those were the days when contentious issues were reported with objectivity, and partisanship was confined to leader and feature articles.

      "body": "<p>In Florida, almost one month after the US presidential election non-result, the plot thickens. Numerous, continuing legal actions have failed so far to resolve the central issue: whether Democrat Al Gore or Republican George W Bush won the state's popular vote and thus its crucial 25 electoral college votes. But the court cases have shone a spotlight on the manner in which the poll was conducted and left many awkward questions.</p> <p>Antiquated equipment, badly designed ballot papers and inefficient vote-counting machinery all contributed to the confusion. Contradictory state laws on the use of absentee ballots, on the time allowed for recounts and whether they may be undertaken by hand have been ruthlessly exposed and dissected by squads of lawyers and judges. The common thread here appears to be incompetence. On this basis, Mr Gore continues to try to force hand recounts in key counties. Mr Bush continues to oppose him, hoping meanwhile that the US supreme court will rule in his favour this week.</p> <p>But as public scrutiny of Florida's deeply flawed electoral process intensifies, the focus is broadening, moving beyond the fate of votes counted (or miscounted or mislaid) to the fate of votes that were never cast at all. As Julian Borger's investigation, which we publish today, shows, black and other minority citizens on whom the Democrats were counting faced unusual obstacles in exercising their democratic rights.</p> <p>Florida's Republican secretary of state, Katherine Harris, backed by Mr Bush's brother, Florida's governor, Jeb Bush, launched a systematic purge of the electoral rolls earlier this year. The result was the exclusion of unknown thousands of voters on the erroneous grounds that they were convicted felons; because they had allegedly not voted in previous elections; because they had moved home; or because officials were told to impose stringent polling-day identity checks, while lacking the time to conduct them properly.</p> <p>Some disenfranchised minority voters also complain of police harassment.

      "bodyText": "In Florida, almost one month after the US presidential election non-result, the plot thickens. Numerous, continuing legal actions have failed so far to resolve the central issue: whether Democrat Al Gore or Republican George W Bush won the state's popular vote and thus its crucial 25 electoral college votes. But the court cases have shone a spotlight on the manner in which the poll was conducted and left many awkward questions. Antiquated equipment, badly designed ballot papers and inefficient vote-counting machinery all contributed to the confusion. Contradictory state laws on the use of absentee ballots, on the time allowed for recounts and whether they may be undertaken by hand have been ruthlessly exposed and dissected by squads of lawyers and judges. The common thread here appears to be incompetence. On this basis, Mr Gore continues to try to force hand recounts in key counties. Mr Bush continues to oppose him, hoping meanwhile that the US supreme court will rule in his favour this week. But as public scrutiny of Florida's deeply flawed electoral process intensifies, the focus is broadening, moving beyond the fate of votes counted (or miscounted or mislaid) to the fate of votes that were never cast at all. As Julian Borger's investigation, which we publish today, shows, black and other minority citizens on whom the Democrats were counting faced unusual obstacles in exercising their democratic rights. Florida's Republican secretary of state, Katherine Harris, backed by Mr Bush's brother, Florida's governor, Jeb Bush, launched a systematic purge of the electoral rolls earlier this year. The result was the exclusion of unknown thousands of voters on the erroneous grounds that they were convicted felons; because they had allegedly not voted in previous elections; because they had moved home; or because officials were told to impose stringent polling-day identity checks, while lacking the time to conduct them properly. Some disenfranchised minority voters also complain of police harassment. The US justice department is reportedly investigating these matters. It should also look at the pre-count \"correcting\" of 15,000 absentee ballots by Republican poll volunteers. And Mr Gore should bite the bullet and ask the courts to take a closer look at the pre-poll activities of Ms Harris, Jeb Bush and others. For what is alleged here goes far beyond incompetence. Put bluntly, it stinks.

      "body": "<p>As the struggle over dimpled chads and voting machines grinds on in the courts, evidence is emerging that the US presidential race was irrevocably tainted before a single ballot was cast - by the systematic and unconstitutional denial of voting rights to thousands of black Floridians.</p> <p>Across Florida, black residents who had taken part in earlier elections without any problems went to vote on November 7 to find a bewildering array of hurdles between them and the ballot box. For many, the day's events were a reminder that Florida is an integral part of the deep south, with a long record of segregation and resistance to black voting rights.</p> <p>The state is under investigation by the justice department for infringing the rights of its minority citizens, but cases of black disenfranchisement have played almost no role in the challenge by the vice-president, Al Gore, to the election results. Ballots cast can be recounted and yield quick results, while votes denied are difficult to measure and hard to claim. But in the longer term, they have far graver implications for US race relations and the health of the nation's democracy.</p> <p>In most cases investigated by the Guardian, the obstacles to black voting rights were clerical and administrative. In a handful of instances, however, they were less subtle.</p> <p>On election morning, Darryl Gorham was driving some neighbours to vote in Woodville, outside Tallahassee. They turned a bend in the road about a mile before the polling station and came across a scene straight out of the segregation era.</p> <p><b>Roadblocks</b></p> <p>\"There were four Florida highway patrolmen standing in the middle of the street, Mr Gorham said. \"They were stopping everybody. They had seven or eight cars stopped on the side of the road and waiting. They inspected the headlights, tail-lights, indicators, licence, registration, tags, everything ... I've lived in Florida most of my life, but I have never ever seen a roadblock like that.\"</p> <p>Mr Gorham is convinced that the white policemen were trying to slow down the flow of black voters in a historically tight election. He said: \"It took maybe 15, maybe 20 minutes. But many people were taking time out from work, or going to work, and it was making them late. Some just turned round and went back.\"</p> <p>Major Ken Howes, a spokesman for the Florida Highway Patrol, said the four policemen had set up the checkpoint without authority from senior officers. An internal investigation has been launched but Major Howes insisted the sergeant in charge had not intended to affect the vote.</p> <p>Robert Chamber, a black resident who lives nearby, is sceptical of the claims of ignorance. He believes the checkpoint's message was quite clear. \"It is putting fear in people's hearts,\" he said. \"It means: 'We'll catch them before they get there.' The racism here may be underground but it's strong. There are places around here we just know not to go.\"</p> <p>There is some hard evidence to back up Mr Chamber's fears. According to a study by the Southern Poverty Law Centre, the largest concentration by far of neo-Confederate white supremacist groups such as the League of the South is centred on the Florida panhandle and the state's western coast.</p> <p>Marvin Davies, a veteran of the 1960s civil rights struggle, said: \"Florida has always been a microcosm of hate ... Both racism and hate are a very viable part of this culture.\"</p> <p>Woodville was not the only alleged police intimidation in Florida. However, by far the greatest damage to minority rights appears to have been inflicted not by men in uniform, but by bureaucrats in suits, quietly and almost invisibly, months before the election.</p> <p>During the presidential campaign, it became clear that Florida would be piv otal and that civil rights groups were making unprecedented efforts to mobilise minority voters behind the Democrats. Under the banner of an anti-fraud campaign, Governor Jeb Bush, the brother of the Republican presidential candidate, and his now-famous secretary of state, Katherine Harris, implemented a series of administrative steps which may well prove to have swung the election.</p> <p>In June, the division of elections in Ms Harris's office drew up a list of more than 700,000 Floridians permanently disqualified from voting - more than any other state - because of a criminal past, and sent it to county election supervisors.</p> <p>The idea was to enforce strictly an 1868 law disqualifying felons and ex-felons from voting for life. The law was originally part of the southern backlash against voter registration among freed slaves after the civil war, and was based on the assumption that black residents got in trouble with the law more often than their white counterparts.</p> <p>That assumption holds true today, in a state where African Americans make up 13% of the general population but 55% of prison inmates. According to Human Rights Watch, around a third of African American men in the state were disqualified from voting because of a past conviction, mostly resulting from the \"war on drugs\" that has been raging in urban America for two decades.</p> <p>But Ms Harris's list went further than simply upholding a 19th-century law. It included several thousand people who should not have been disqualified, either because they had gone through the arduous process of having their rights restored or because they had never been convicted of a felony in the first place.</p> <p>The list was so riddled with errors that Palm Beach and Duval election boards simply ignored it, leading to Republican allegations that more than 300 ex-felons had voted in those counties. But their numbers appear to be far outweighed by those wrongly disenfranchised elsewhere.</p> <p>When he was 23, Wallace McDonald fell asleep on a bench in Tampa waiting for a bus. He was arrested for vagrancy and obliged to pay for his misdemeanour by working on a municipal rubbish truck. Disgusted with his sentence, the young McDonald walked off the job, an offence for which he was fined $30.</p> <p>That was in 1959. Forty-one years on, Mr McDonald received a letter from the Hillsborough County election supervisor, Pam Iorio, informing him that as an ex-felon his name had been removed from the voters' roll.</p> <p>\"I could not believe it, after voting for all these years since the 50s, without a problem,\" he said, pointing out that even by Florida's harsh standards his offence did not amount to a felony. \"I knew something was unfair about that. To be able to vote all your life then to have somebody reach in a bag and take some technicality that you can't vote,\" Mr McDonald said. \"Why now? Something's wrong.\"</p> <p>He is in good company. The Rev Willie Dixon received a full pardon for drug offences in 1985, and has since become a youth leader and bible preacher, a pillar of the Tampa black community who has voted in every presidential election. Until he received one of Ms Iorio's letters.</p> <p>Kelvin King never received a letter. He was also released in 1985, after becoming another statistic in the drug war. He got his registration card and had voted in the three presidential polls held since his release from jail. This November, he was ejected from a polling station after his name turned up on the blacklist.</p> <p>\"The lady on the desk just told me I was a felon. It was a bit of a shock,\" Mr King said. \"I suppose I was disgusted at myself for what I had done in the past, but I assumed it had been taken care of.\"</p> <p>In her Tampa offices, a defensive Ms Iorio, a Democrat, pointed the finger of blame at Tallahassee. \"Yes, there were errors on the list,\" she said. \"There were instances of mistaken identity and people who should not have been on it. Something doesn't work right in the system.\"</p> <p>But the county election supervisor defended her use of Ms Harris's list. Anyone wrongly listed as a felon had ample opportunity to appeal, she argued.</p> <p>Mr Dixon did manage to have his criminal taint removed but Mr McDonald was not so fortunate, despite the best efforts of his lawyer. Mr King never had a chance.</p> <p>It is not just ex-convicts who found themselves excluded. Civil rights groups have been inundated with complaints from mainly black voters that they had not found their names on the voters' roll.</p> <p>Again, many of the disenfranchised appear to have fallen prey to the Florida government's zeal in applying electoral regulations. Under federal law, states can purge citizens from the rolls if they fail to participate in two consecutive federal elections and if letters sent to their address are returned.</p> <p>But once more, Ms Harris's office appears to have gone beyond the letter of the law, ordering a comprehensive purge of the rolls in October, provoking several hundred complaints from would-be voters who said their names had been erased despite a consistent voting record.</p> <p><b>Discrimination</b></p> <p>Once again, the vast majority of those complaining are black. It may be that low-income minority families are less settled and more likely to change address but community leaders are convinced their disenfranchisement reflects deeper discrimination. They can point to the case of Kandy Wells, a black woman who registered in Tampa on the same September day as her white husband. He received his voter's card two weeks before election day. Mrs Wells is still waiting for hers.</p> <p>\"You've got to remember that only 40 or 50 years ago blacks couldn't vote,\" she said. \"Things like this have been happen ing in Florida all along. It's just that this time it's so close and they got caught.\"</p> <p>Black voters across the state have also claimed that they were subjected to more stringent identity checks than their white neighbours, leading to longer delays. In Miami, Haitian immigrants were routinely denied their right to bring an interpreter to the polling booth to help translate the ballot.</p> <p>In theory, the \"errors\" should have been corrected on election day, but in many places officials were so overwhelmed by the problem that the instant appeals mechanism collapsed. In Tampa, lines to Ms Iorio's office were overwhelmed as voters tried in vain to call from polling stations to have themselves reinstated.

      "bodyText": "As the struggle over dimpled chads and voting machines grinds on in the courts, evidence is emerging that the US presidential race was irrevocably tainted before a single ballot was cast - by the systematic and unconstitutional denial of voting rights to thousands of black Floridians. Across Florida, black residents who had taken part in earlier elections without any problems went to vote on November 7 to find a bewildering array of hurdles between them and the ballot box. For many, the day's events were a reminder that Florida is an integral part of the deep south, with a long record of segregation and resistance to black voting rights. The state is under investigation by the justice department for infringing the rights of its minority citizens, but cases of black disenfranchisement have played almost no role in the challenge by the vice-president, Al Gore, to the election results. Ballots cast can be recounted and yield quick results, while votes denied are difficult to measure and hard to claim. But in the longer term, they have far graver implications for US race relations and the health of the nation's democracy. In most cases investigated by the Guardian, the obstacles to black voting rights were clerical and administrative. In a handful of instances, however, they were less subtle. On election morning, Darryl Gorham was driving some neighbours to vote in Woodville, outside Tallahassee. They turned a bend in the road about a mile before the polling station and came across a scene straight out of the segregation era. Roadblocks \"There were four Florida highway patrolmen standing in the middle of the street, Mr Gorham said. \"They were stopping everybody. They had seven or eight cars stopped on the side of the road and waiting. They inspected the headlights, tail-lights, indicators, licence, registration, tags, everything ... I've lived in Florida most of my life, but I have never ever seen a roadblock like that.\" Mr Gorham is convinced that the white policemen were trying to slow down the flow of black voters in a historically tight election. He said: \"It took maybe 15, maybe 20 minutes. But many people were taking time out from work, or going to work, and it was making them late. Some just turned round and went back.\" Major Ken Howes, a spokesman for the Florida Highway Patrol, said the four policemen had set up the checkpoint without authority from senior officers. An internal investigation has been launched but Major Howes insisted the sergeant in charge had not intended to affect the vote. Robert Chamber, a black resident who lives nearby, is sceptical of the claims of ignorance. He believes the checkpoint's message was quite clear. \"It is putting fear in people's hearts,\" he said. \"It means: 'We'll catch them before they get there.' The racism here may be underground but it's strong. There are places around here we just know not to go.\" There is some hard evidence to back up Mr Chamber's fears. According to a study by the Southern Poverty Law Centre, the largest concentration by far of neo-Confederate white supremacist groups such as the League of the South is centred on the Florida panhandle and the state's western coast. Marvin Davies, a veteran of the 1960s civil rights struggle, said: \"Florida has always been a microcosm of hate ... Both racism and hate are a very viable part of this culture.\" Woodville was not the only alleged police intimidation in Florida. However, by far the greatest damage to minority rights appears to have been inflicted not by men in uniform, but by bureaucrats in suits, quietly and almost invisibly, months before the election. During the presidential campaign, it became clear that Florida would be piv otal and that civil rights groups were making unprecedented efforts to mobilise minority voters behind the Democrats. Under the banner of an anti-fraud campaign, Governor Jeb Bush, the brother of the Republican presidential candidate, and his now-famous secretary of state, Katherine Harris, implemented a series of administrative steps which may well prove to have swung the election. In June, the division of elections in Ms Harris's office drew up a list of more than 700,000 Floridians permanently disqualified from voting - more than any other state - because of a criminal past, and sent it to county election supervisors. The idea was to enforce strictly an 1868 law disqualifying felons and ex-felons from voting for life. The law was originally part of the southern backlash against voter registration among freed slaves after the civil war, and was based on the assumption that black residents got in trouble with the law more often than their white counterparts. That assumption holds true today, in a state where African Americans make up 13% of the general population but 55% of prison inmates. According to Human Rights Watch, around a third of African American men in the state were disqualified from voting because of a past conviction, mostly resulting from the \"war on drugs\" that has been raging in urban America for two decades. But Ms Harris's list went further than simply upholding a 19th-century law. It included several thousand people who should not have been disqualified, either because they had gone through the arduous process of having their rights restored or because they had never been convicted of a felony in the first place. The list was so riddled with errors that Palm Beach and Duval election boards simply ignored it, leading to Republican allegations that more than 300 ex-felons had voted in those counties. But their numbers appear to be far outweighed by those wrongly disenfranchised elsewhere. When he was 23, Wallace McDonald fell asleep on a bench in Tampa waiting for a bus. He was arrested for vagrancy and obliged to pay for his misdemeanour by working on a municipal rubbish truck. Disgusted with his sentence, the young McDonald walked off the job, an offence for which he was fined $30. That was in 1959. Forty-one years on, Mr McDonald received a letter from the Hillsborough County election supervisor, Pam Iorio, informing him that as an ex-felon his name had been removed from the voters' roll. \"I could not believe it, after voting for all these years since the 50s, without a problem,\" he said, pointing out that even by Florida's harsh standards his offence did not amount to a felony. \"I knew something was unfair about that. To be able to vote all your life then to have somebody reach in a bag and take some technicality that you can't vote,\" Mr McDonald said. \"Why now? Something's wrong.\" He is in good company. The Rev Willie Dixon received a full pardon for drug offences in 1985, and has since become a youth leader and bible preacher, a pillar of the Tampa black community who has voted in every presidential election. Until he received one of Ms Iorio's letters. Kelvin King never received a letter. He was also released in 1985, after becoming another statistic in the drug war. He got his registration card and had voted in the three presidential polls held since his release from jail. This November, he was ejected from a polling station after his name turned up on the blacklist. \"The lady on the desk just told me I was a felon. It was a bit of a shock,\" Mr King said. \"I suppose I was disgusted at myself for what I had done in the past, but I assumed it had been taken care of.\" In her Tampa offices, a defensive Ms Iorio, a Democrat, pointed the finger of blame at Tallahassee. \"Yes, there were errors on the list,\" she said. \"There were instances of mistaken identity and people who should not have been on it. Something doesn't work right in the system.\" But the county election supervisor defended her use of Ms Harris's list. Anyone wrongly listed as a felon had ample opportunity to appeal, she argued. Mr Dixon did manage to have his criminal taint removed but Mr McDonald was not so fortunate, despite the best efforts of his lawyer. Mr King never had a chance. It is not just ex-convicts who found themselves excluded. Civil rights groups have been inundated with complaints from mainly black voters that they had not found their names on the voters' roll. Again, many of the disenfranchised appear to have fallen prey to the Florida government's zeal in applying electoral regulations. Under federal law, states can purge citizens from the rolls if they fail to participate in two consecutive federal elections and if letters sent to their address are returned. But once more, Ms Harris's office appears to have gone beyond the letter of the law, ordering a comprehensive purge of the rolls in October, provoking several hundred complaints from would-be voters who said their names had been erased despite a consistent voting record. Discrimination Once again, the vast majority of those complaining are black. It may be that low-income minority families are less settled and more likely to change address but community leaders are convinced their disenfranchisement reflects deeper discrimination. They can point to the case of Kandy Wells, a black woman who registered in Tampa on the same September day as her white husband. He received his voter's card two weeks before election day. Mrs Wells is still waiting for hers. \"You've got to remember that only 40 or 50 years ago blacks couldn't vote,\" she said. \"Things like this have been happen ing in Florida all along. It's just that this time it's so close and they got caught.\" Black voters across the state have also claimed that they were subjected to more stringent identity checks than their white neighbours, leading to longer delays. In Miami, Haitian immigrants were routinely denied their right to bring an interpreter to the polling booth to help translate the ballot. In theory, the \"errors\" should have been corrected on election day, but in many places officials were so overwhelmed by the problem that the instant appeals mechanism collapsed. In Tampa, lines to Ms Iorio's office were overwhelmed as voters tried in vain to call from polling stations to have themselves reinstated. Again, low-income minority neighbourhoods were worst affected, magnifying the impression that Florida was practising selective disenfranchisement. Governor Bush's administration has dismissed claims of discrimination as yet another Democratic ruse aimed at undermining the election result. And the De mocratic party is clearly reluctant to pick up the banner of its black supporters. But the angry mood among black Floridians is unlikely to be dispelled without an examination of what happened on November 7 and beforehand. It is a reckoning that is likely to last far longer than the recounts squabble, because it lies at the heart of black experience in the south. In Marvin Davies's eyes, the battle over the Florida election is simply the continuation of the earlier, bloodier struggles of the 1950s and 1960s. \"When you go into that ballot box, the black man has the same power as the white man, so the white man will use all his money and all his power to stop the black man getting there,\" Mr Davies said.

And unusually, the product - an energy drink to rival Red Bull - is being kept out of shops with availability restricted to clubs and bars. The low-key launch has so far been restricted to a few trendy events in London. It has been being promoted at a party organised by DJ magazine for the country's top 100 DJs at the trendy Covent Garden club The End and an after-show party for singer Gabrielle's concert, held at the hip south London venue the K Bar.

Burn is the first Coca-Cola brand to be aimed deliberately at a niche market. It has been formulated to mix with spirits such as vodka and will only be available in clubs and bars, not in shops.

      "body": "<p>As patients and visitors bustle through the squeaky automatic doors into Plymouth's Derriford hospital, they are greeted by a warm, almost spotlessly clean reception area dominated by a private cafe serving hot drinks and healthy snacks. </p> <p>But all is not entirely well at Derriford, and this week a symptom of what appears to be an underlying sickness will erupt into public view. </p> <p>On Friday, a consultant surgeon of white, English origin will claim that she was racially victimised by a fellow consultant after being sent home after a row over an alleged racist remark. </p> <p>Judy Evans, a plastic surgeon, who was sent home from Derriford last June, is expected to appear at a preliminary employment tribunal hearing, where she will allege sexual discrimination against the hospital trust. </p> <p>She will also allege \"victimisation under the terms of the Race Relations Act\" against one of her former colleagues in the plastic surgery department. </p> <p>It follows an incident last February when a black junior doctor was allegedly told by a senior consultant after making a minor mistake: \"You are not operating on bloody Nigerians now. These are my patients - they are normal human beings.\" </p> <p>The junior, a trainee plastic surgeon, was a British woman of Nigerian ancestry who had already been the butt of some unthinking racism and was horrified by the remark. She was backed up by Dr Evans. </p> <p>Shortly afterwards, colleagues alleged that Dr Evans' work was below standard and she was put on \"gardening leave\" while managers ordered an investigation. </p> <p>The tribunal is expected to highlight a macho \"old guard\" of consultants and managers who have already embroiled the trust in legal proceedings. </p> <p>In January, two Asian surgeons took Derriford to an employment tribunal claiming that they had not received merit awards - financial bonuses paid to consultants on top of their salaries - because of their race. </p> <p>The bonuses, granted under a points system decided by a series of committees, could add up to \u00a358,000 on top of a consultants' basic salary of \u00a362,000. </p> <p>Jagdev Mohan, a brain surgeon of Indian origin, and Maher Halawa, an Egyptian-born orthopaedic surgeon, alleged that a small circle of white male doctors used the merit scheme to reward friends. </p> <p>Mr Mohan told the hearings: \"The major problem is that we are not in the favoured circles. The old pals' act does not work for us as it does for the white majority.\" </p> <p>After five days of embarrassing evidence, the hospital settled the case out of court and agreed to reform the merit scheme. </p> <p>The worst manifestation of unacceptable behaviour appears to have put patients' safety at risk. </p> <p>In January Martin Cusack, then the trust's deputy chief executive, circulated a memo to all staff warning against \"unprofessional\" or \"inappropriate\" behaviour in theatre. </p> <p>He specified \"practical jokes, strong language, sexual innuendo\" and warned that such behaviour \"can deliberately or inadvertently affect the safety and well being of patients and staff\". </p> <p>The Guardian has learned that the \"boys' club\" culture manifested itself in remarks such as the phrase \"bedroom view\" - used by doctors to describe a prostrate woman. </p> <p>Several staff have complained about one doctor, who remarked within earshot of an 84-year-old woman being treated for cancer: \"Sometimes it's like being a vet - a cow can't tell you what's wrong with her either.\" </p> <p>A senior hospital management insider admitted to the Guardian: \"There is a real culture problem; it is very old-fashioned, very doctor-dominated.\" </p> <p>While stressing the trust's concerns were confined to a minority, the source blamed a cosy network involving some senior consultants: \"There has never been any competition in the internal market because Derriford is too far away.\" </p> <p>Historically, Derriford - which opened in 1981 - has been under-resourced, say insiders. </p> <p>The hospital, at the far southwestern end of the country and a long way from metropolitan areas, did not provide specialist treatments on offer to patients elsewhere. </p> <p>\"People here were victims of a classic NHS postcode lottery,\" a senior insider said. </p> <p>In the last five to 10 years, Derriford has gone through rapid expansion and it now offers some of the specialist services hitherto unavailable locally. </p> <p>But the rapid growth has brought its own problems. For basic treatments, the hospital serves a population of around 430,000 in Plymouth and the surrounding areas of south Devon and Cornwall. </p> <p>But for specialist operations, such as kidney transplants, it serves up to 2m people across a vast swath of southwest England. </p> <p>With a backlog of patients seeking access to the services it now provides, the hospital is frantically trying to catch up with demand. </p> <p>\"The expansion of services they provide has produced a tension in Derriford,\" said Plymouth GP Peter Williams, who like his fellow GPs takes the brunt of patient anger. </p> <p>\"We don't know whether the reason they haven't performed brilliantly is because they haven't managed the pressures very well, or because they haven't been resourced properly for those services.\" </p> <p>The trust's new chief executive, Paul Roberts, acknowledged the scale of the problems facing Derriford. </p> <p>He declined to comment directly on allegations of a racist and sexist old boy network, but made pointed reference to the government's national plan - a vision for the NHS which attacks \"old-fashioned demarcations\" between staff and services, and aims to tackle the \"disempowerment\" of patients. </p> <p>\"The sort of changes we need to make are about cultural and organisational changes,\" he said.

      "bodyText": "As patients and visitors bustle through the squeaky automatic doors into Plymouth's Derriford hospital, they are greeted by a warm, almost spotlessly clean reception area dominated by a private cafe serving hot drinks and healthy snacks. But all is not entirely well at Derriford, and this week a symptom of what appears to be an underlying sickness will erupt into public view. On Friday, a consultant surgeon of white, English origin will claim that she was racially victimised by a fellow consultant after being sent home after a row over an alleged racist remark. Judy Evans, a plastic surgeon, who was sent home from Derriford last June, is expected to appear at a preliminary employment tribunal hearing, where she will allege sexual discrimination against the hospital trust. She will also allege \"victimisation under the terms of the Race Relations Act\" against one of her former colleagues in the plastic surgery department. It follows an incident last February when a black junior doctor was allegedly told by a senior consultant after making a minor mistake: \"You are not operating on bloody Nigerians now. These are my patients - they are normal human beings.\" The junior, a trainee plastic surgeon, was a British woman of Nigerian ancestry who had already been the butt of some unthinking racism and was horrified by the remark. She was backed up by Dr Evans. Shortly afterwards, colleagues alleged that Dr Evans' work was below standard and she was put on \"gardening leave\" while managers ordered an investigation. The tribunal is expected to highlight a macho \"old guard\" of consultants and managers who have already embroiled the trust in legal proceedings. In January, two Asian surgeons took Derriford to an employment tribunal claiming that they had not received merit awards - financial bonuses paid to consultants on top of their salaries - because of their race. The bonuses, granted under a points system decided by a series of committees, could add up to \u00a358,000 on top of a consultants' basic salary of \u00a362,000. Jagdev Mohan, a brain surgeon of Indian origin, and Maher Halawa, an Egyptian-born orthopaedic surgeon, alleged that a small circle of white male doctors used the merit scheme to reward friends. Mr Mohan told the hearings: \"The major problem is that we are not in the favoured circles. The old pals' act does not work for us as it does for the white majority.\" After five days of embarrassing evidence, the hospital settled the case out of court and agreed to reform the merit scheme. The worst manifestation of unacceptable behaviour appears to have put patients' safety at risk. In January Martin Cusack, then the trust's deputy chief executive, circulated a memo to all staff warning against \"unprofessional\" or \"inappropriate\" behaviour in theatre. He specified \"practical jokes, strong language, sexual innuendo\" and warned that such behaviour \"can deliberately or inadvertently affect the safety and well being of patients and staff\". The Guardian has learned that the \"boys' club\" culture manifested itself in remarks such as the phrase \"bedroom view\" - used by doctors to describe a prostrate woman. Several staff have complained about one doctor, who remarked within earshot of an 84-year-old woman being treated for cancer: \"Sometimes it's like being a vet - a cow can't tell you what's wrong with her either.\" A senior hospital management insider admitted to the Guardian: \"There is a real culture problem; it is very old-fashioned, very doctor-dominated.\" While stressing the trust's concerns were confined to a minority, the source blamed a cosy network involving some senior consultants: \"There has never been any competition in the internal market because Derriford is too far away.\" Historically, Derriford - which opened in 1981 - has been under-resourced, say insiders. The hospital, at the far southwestern end of the country and a long way from metropolitan areas, did not provide specialist treatments on offer to patients elsewhere. \"People here were victims of a classic NHS postcode lottery,\" a senior insider said. In the last five to 10 years, Derriford has gone through rapid expansion and it now offers some of the specialist services hitherto unavailable locally. But the rapid growth has brought its own problems. For basic treatments, the hospital serves a population of around 430,000 in Plymouth and the surrounding areas of south Devon and Cornwall. But for specialist operations, such as kidney transplants, it serves up to 2m people across a vast swath of southwest England. With a backlog of patients seeking access to the services it now provides, the hospital is frantically trying to catch up with demand. \"The expansion of services they provide has produced a tension in Derriford,\" said Plymouth GP Peter Williams, who like his fellow GPs takes the brunt of patient anger. \"We don't know whether the reason they haven't performed brilliantly is because they haven't managed the pressures very well, or because they haven't been resourced properly for those services.\" The trust's new chief executive, Paul Roberts, acknowledged the scale of the problems facing Derriford. He declined to comment directly on allegations of a racist and sexist old boy network, but made pointed reference to the government's national plan - a vision for the NHS which attacks \"old-fashioned demarcations\" between staff and services, and aims to tackle the \"disempowerment\" of patients. \"The sort of changes we need to make are about cultural and organisational changes,\" he said. There was the need to end a culture in which a \"small minority of people are fighting their corners\". There are 11 clinical directorates covering areas such as heart and lung, cancer care, and paediatrics. Mr Roberts envisages simplifying this to four divisions based around the patients' needs rather than doctors' convenience. He also expects much-needed funding from the government's national plan. One of his crucial problems is nurse recruitment. Last week it emerged that a shortage of specialist nurses meant brain surgery at the hospital had to be cancelled. GPs like Dr Williams fear Derriford being swamped this winter. Its bed occupancy rates run at 95%, against a national rate of 84%. The hospital has already had six red alerts this year, and a crisis such as a flu outbreak could put unbearable strain on bed availability. But there is no shortage of government help, including \u00a3800,000 to get vulnerable and elderly patients out of hospital and into care. There is also a silver lining in the recent approval for Derriford to become a teaching hospital, in partnership with two other southwest hospitals. Teaching hospitals, with their ethos of research, are exciting places to work and will attract staff, Mr Roberts hopes. However, trying to solve waiting list problems has already claimed the scalp of his predecessor. In some cases, the date patients were put on a list was altered to hide the fact they had been waiting over the government's limit of 18 months; patients were moved on to \"suspended\" lists; and 90 patients, who were mostly waiting for treatment from Dr Evans, were found to have simply \"disappeared\" from the lists. Chief executive Arthur Wilson resigned in June. An NHS taskforce has now been sent in to help reform the hospital's management of waiting lists. In the meantime, Dr Evans has become a martyr in the eyes of Plymouth's public but her future remains unclear. In her department, plastic surgery, the rift between her supporters and critics has fostered a poisonous climate in which trivial differences of opinion have become potentially explosive. There has even been a row over the background tapes played in theatre, with colleagues frowning upon some of the surgeons' taste for loud rock music as they operate. Dr Evans' supporters concede there are problems with specific areas of her practice. But in February an inquiry team found no problem with the majority of her work. The trust's quandary is how to reinstate her without bringing to a boil the rivalries in the department. Like everything else that Derriford needs, solving that predicament will not be an easy task.",

He says: \"These plans are backed up by some hard cash and a welcome recognition of the role of carers.\" However, he adds: \"There must also be a commitment to long-term training of health and social services staff and a high-profile public campaign to end the stigma surrounding mental illness.\" Strategies to recruit and train staff need careful planning and more thought needs to go into the incentive scheme, where rewards or punishments are given to green, yellow and red (good, OK and bad) services. Has the plan missed anything out? The SCMH would like to see improvements in hospital ward quality, a higher profile given to mental health promotion and recognition of the challenges posed by interaction between providers. The plan allocates an extra \u00a3300m for mental health serices by 2004. The SCMH doubts this is enough. It is also unclear whether the plan will be partly financed by the general (non-mental health) NHS budget.",

Harry Fletcher, the assistant general secretary, of the National Association of Probation Officers, said there was not enough money to provide the kind of monitoring of offenders that was needed. \"The probation service's liaison arrangements with the police are very good but unless resources are dedicated to this task I fear that something awful will happen.\"",

Whichever agency is appointed to the business will play a key role in promoting these ventures. Lego's objective is to build on the natural fit between Lego play materials and its media products.

I will look over the likes of the Guardian and the Telegraph on a train journey - which could last for several years these days. I check the Financial Times to see if I can understand anything that is written in it but I never can. </p> <p> <strong> Magazines: </strong> I look at FHM, Heat and Later. I like the conflicting advice section in Later when Jeremy Clarkson or Chris Moyles give advice. </p> <p> <strong> Radio: </strong> Radio 1, Capital FM and Virgin. Chris Tarrant is one of the best personality DJs ever. I also like Sara Cox's sense of humour and warmth. Chris Evans does a fantastic show. He has a great broadcasting sense and talent. I also like Brian Perkins on Radio 4. When you listen to him you get a sense of a real national institution. </p> <p> <strong> Television: </strong> I watch the Big Breakfast and really admire Johnny Vaughan. We were wearing exactly the same shirt when I was filming as him outside the Big Breakfast. Trigger Happy TV was a real treat. I only watch soaps in a professional capacity if I have to learn a new impression such as Phil Mitchell or Mark Fowler. For enjoyment, Ali G is still going strong. </p> <p> <strong> Books: </strong> I'm not really a reader but wish I was. I'm too easily distracted - but I did like Time for Bed by David Baddiel. </p> <p> <strong> Films: </strong> The last films I saw were Some Like It Hot and Breakfast at Tiffany's after they were digitally re-done. It was brilliant to see them at the cinema. I've just bought The Talented Mr Ripley, Private Parts and Swingers on DVD. </p> <p> <strong> Adverts: </strong> I'm looking forward to seeing the new one on racial equality. I think that will have a great impact. I hate \"Whassup!\" now. Every pillock in the land is going \"Whassup!\" </p> <p> <strong> New media: </strong> I have got a Wap phone but I never got beyond page four in the instructions. I don't use the internet much. I get bored waiting for it to load. </p> <p>\u0095 Dead Ringers impressionist Jon Culshaw stars in the new Tango advert.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Newspapers: I glance through all of them. I like the Mirror and the Sun's sense of humour. I will look over the likes of the Guardian and the Telegraph on a train journey - which could last for several years these days. I check the Financial Times to see if I can understand anything that is written in it but I never can. Magazines: I look at FHM, Heat and Later. I like the conflicting advice section in Later when Jeremy Clarkson or Chris Moyles give advice. Radio: Radio 1, Capital FM and Virgin. Chris Tarrant is one of the best personality DJs ever. I also like Sara Cox's sense of humour and warmth. Chris Evans does a fantastic show. He has a great broadcasting sense and talent. I also like Brian Perkins on Radio 4. When you listen to him you get a sense of a real national institution. Television: I watch the Big Breakfast and really admire Johnny Vaughan. We were wearing exactly the same shirt when I was filming as him outside the Big Breakfast. Trigger Happy TV was a real treat. I only watch soaps in a professional capacity if I have to learn a new impression such as Phil Mitchell or Mark Fowler. For enjoyment, Ali G is still going strong. Books: I'm not really a reader but wish I was. I'm too easily distracted - but I did like Time for Bed by David Baddiel. Films: The last films I saw were Some Like It Hot and Breakfast at Tiffany's after they were digitally re-done. It was brilliant to see them at the cinema. I've just bought The Talented Mr Ripley, Private Parts and Swingers on DVD. Adverts: I'm looking forward to seeing the new one on racial equality. I think that will have a great impact. I hate \"Whassup!\" now. Every pillock in the land is going \"Whassup!\" New media: I have got a Wap phone but I never got beyond page four in the instructions. I don't use the internet much. I get bored waiting for it to load. \u0095 Dead Ringers impressionist Jon Culshaw stars in the new Tango advert.",

      "body": "<p>A 13-year-old was stabbed in a London street yesterday, less than a week after Damilola Taylor was killed as he walked home from school.</p> <p>The black boy was walking with an Asian friend in Hackney Wick, north-east London, when they were approached by two youths who stole a mobile phone and cash from the Asian boy, also aged 13.</p> <p>A passer-by intervened and the robbers left, but they returned when the two boys were on their own, punching the Asian and stabbing his friend with a knife, leaving him seriously injured. London Ambulance Service said he had cuts to his stomach but his condition was stable.</p> <p>Meanwhile a gang of youths aged 10 to 14 has become the focus of the Damilola Taylor investigation. They were loitering in Peckham, south London, the night he was stabbed.</p> <p>Witnesses have told Scotland Yard detectives that between six and 10 boys were outside the librarywhere the 10-year-old had joined an after-school computer class last Monday. An anonymous 999 call reported a bottle fight between youths shortly before Damilola was attacked, but police found no evidence of the incident. Detective Superin tendent David Dillnutt, overseeing the inquiry, said: \"We are still seeking witnesses at the library from about 3.35pm when Damilola arrived _ this is a particular square where children meet.\" Police believe a woman in a red anorak with a small child was also outside the library. The fresh appeal for information came follow ing the arrest and release on Saturday of two boys, aged 12 and 13, and a 39-year-old woman.</p> <p>During a press conference Mr Dillnutt dismissed reports that Damilola's family believed their son, who was born in Nigeria and had moved to the UK four months ago, was being bullied by West Indian youths. \"We have no evidence of this. The family is not saying this is a racial incident or a racist attack. We simply do not know if there is a link between the bullying that had been complained of by Damilola's family and his death.\"</p> <p>Sir John Stevens, the commissioner of the Metropolitan police, acknowledged, how ever, that there were tensions on the Peckham estate where he was killed. \"What is being said is that there is a certain amount of tension between racial groups,\" he told London Weekend Television. \"We must not deny that, but we must also not build that up into a situation where there's more violence.\" Sir John said 70 officers were on the case. All of Damilola's classmates had been seen, and 100 adults have come forward. A memorial service was held yesterday.</p> <p>\u0095The government will this week announce plans to extend youth curfews to anyone aged up to 16. Ministers will also review policy on the carrying of knives.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A 13-year-old was stabbed in a London street yesterday, less than a week after Damilola Taylor was killed as he walked home from school. The black boy was walking with an Asian friend in Hackney Wick, north-east London, when they were approached by two youths who stole a mobile phone and cash from the Asian boy, also aged 13. A passer-by intervened and the robbers left, but they returned when the two boys were on their own, punching the Asian and stabbing his friend with a knife, leaving him seriously injured. London Ambulance Service said he had cuts to his stomach but his condition was stable. Meanwhile a gang of youths aged 10 to 14 has become the focus of the Damilola Taylor investigation. They were loitering in Peckham, south London, the night he was stabbed. Witnesses have told Scotland Yard detectives that between six and 10 boys were outside the librarywhere the 10-year-old had joined an after-school computer class last Monday. An anonymous 999 call reported a bottle fight between youths shortly before Damilola was attacked, but police found no evidence of the incident. Detective Superin tendent David Dillnutt, overseeing the inquiry, said: \"We are still seeking witnesses at the library from about 3.35pm when Damilola arrived _ this is a particular square where children meet.\" Police believe a woman in a red anorak with a small child was also outside the library. The fresh appeal for information came follow ing the arrest and release on Saturday of two boys, aged 12 and 13, and a 39-year-old woman. During a press conference Mr Dillnutt dismissed reports that Damilola's family believed their son, who was born in Nigeria and had moved to the UK four months ago, was being bullied by West Indian youths. \"We have no evidence of this. The family is not saying this is a racial incident or a racist attack. We simply do not know if there is a link between the bullying that had been complained of by Damilola's family and his death.\" Sir John Stevens, the commissioner of the Metropolitan police, acknowledged, how ever, that there were tensions on the Peckham estate where he was killed. \"What is being said is that there is a certain amount of tension between racial groups,\" he told London Weekend Television. \"We must not deny that, but we must also not build that up into a situation where there's more violence.\" Sir John said 70 officers were on the case. All of Damilola's classmates had been seen, and 100 adults have come forward. A memorial service was held yesterday. \u0095The government will this week announce plans to extend youth curfews to anyone aged up to 16. Ministers will also review policy on the carrying of knives.",

Last night, as Robin Cook joined fellow EU foreign ministers for a final negotiating session in Brussels, there was no sign that key problems were any closer to being resolved. In London, sniping continued between the government and the Tories over what was at stake in what is widely billed as the EU's most significant treaty since Maastricht. The latest draft of the Nice text, distributed by the French presidency, offers no solution to the vexed issue of voting weights, which are crucial to the balance of power among the EU's four big countries. The French and German leaders predicted after meeting in Hanover that they would eventually reach agreement. But that could mean more pressure on Tony Blair to give ground on majority voting, which he has vowed to resist on tax, social security and other key areas.

The Conservatives claimed that the chancellor, Gordon Brown, was willing to abandon the veto so Britain could be forced to bail out countries suffering economic difficulties due to the single currency. Francis Maude, the shadow foreign secretary, described the proposals as \"fiscal federalism,\" but this interpretation was rejected by the Treasury. One of the reforms to be discussed at Nice would allow aid to be given in the event of natural disasters like floods, but Mr Maude said the clause permitted fiscal transfers where a member state is threatened by difficulties caused by \"exceptional circumstances beyond its control\". The Tory attack was blunted by veterans of the Major and Thatcher administrations railing against the current party line on Europe. Lord Brittan described the Conservatives' current stance as \"irrational, counter-productive and against the national interest.\" Chris Patten, the former party chairman and now a European commissioner, said Britain needed a government that engaged constructively with Europe, which he suggested the current Tory leadership was not doing. The former foreign secretary, Lord Hurd, told Sky News that Nice would not undermine British sovereignty. \"The idea 'veto good, majority voting bad' is grossly oversimplified,\" he said.

However no decisions have been taken.\" A spokeswoman said the plan would require new legislation. John Wadham, director of the civil rights group Liberty, said yesterday: \"The security services and the police have a voracious appetite for collecting up information about our private lives, but this is an extraordinary idea. \"This would violate the principles of the Data Protection Act and the Human Rights Act and the government should reject this idea now. If it goes ahead we will challenge this in the courts in this country and the European court of human rights.\" The government has already increased the powers of the police and the security and intelligence agencies to monitor emails and other forms of communications through the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act. This allows the agencies to collect \"communications data\" - websites and email addresses used by individuals - without obtaining any warrant. It also allows the police to demand the keys to encrypted data and provides for connection data held by internet service providers to be made available to NCIS. The government said it needed the new powers in the war against paedophiles, drug traffickers, and organised criminal gangs. GCHQ already has the capacity to monitor all calls made on mobile telephones.",

      "bodyText": "A new public protection system to manage the most dangerous sex offenders after their release from prison is already under strain because the numbers involved have trebled in the past year. Home Office officials have told probation officers that around 30 offenders a month are now being identified as potentially dangerous: likely to pose a risk to the public, or in need of protection themselves on release. The new system was put in place in April last year after the high profile release of sex offenders such as Sidney Cooke and Robert Oliver sparked vigilante protests. An early warning system was set up, under which prison and probation authorities and the police advise Home Office ministers of their plans to handle the release of inmates deemed still to be particularly dangerous two months before they are due to leave jail. Although the offenders have finished their sentences they agree to live in probation hostels with specific monitoring and supervision arrangements. But a rise in the number of such dangerous offenders being released from 10 a month when the scheme got under way last year to about 30 a month now is putting it under great strain. Paddy Doyle, a senior official in the Home Office's dangerous offenders unit, last week heard complaints from probation officers that it was becoming increasingly difficult to place all the offenders in appropriate accommodation because of the numbers involved. The number of offenders deemed to be dangerous and living in London has now passed the 900 mark and the new Criminal Justice Act, which reached the statute book on Friday, will place a new duty on police and probation services to make arrangements for assessing and managing all convicted sex criminals and violent offenders on their patch. Mr Doyle said the Home Office was also setting up a new unit to oversee the release plans for each prisoner who was deemed to be dangerous. A report on each one goes to the prisons minister, Paul Boateng. So far only 40 sex offender orders have been made under the new system since its introduction last April. These require convicted sex offenders to register for at least five years and to comply with other conditions, which may include electronic tagging, to protect the public from serious harm. As it costs an average of \u00a324,000 a month for a police surveillance team to monitor just one offender round the clock, different methods of keeping track of these dangerous ex-prisoners are being developed around the country. In some areas the police and probation will offer a violent offender a \"tenancy agreement\" before they come out, under which they agree to curfew and tagging restrictions. Harry Fletcher, the assistant general secretary, of the National Association of Probation Officers, said there was not enough money to provide the kind of monitoring of offenders that was needed. \"The probation service's liaison arrangements with the police are very good but unless resources are dedicated to this task I fear that something awful will happen.\"",

She's never frolicked on the photocopier with Peter from the accounts department, never filched so much as a With Compliments slip from the office stationery cupboard. She is, in short, the perfect PA. \"An angel,\" her boss calls her. </p> <p>But never does Margaret's employer value her more than at this time of year. As the PA to an executive at a bank in the City, Margaret is responsible for purchasing the Christmas corporate gifts. And - as she'll have you know - it's an important job. The gifts you give your clients, or even your rivals, speak volumes about your company's image. </p> <p>Margaret has been at the helm of corporate gift-buying for six years, but, she confesses, \"I screwed up big time for the first three. I didn't get the right things. I got what I thought was really nice wine, but I didn't want to spend too much, I was trying to economise. I think it's instinctive, because I am a housewife. But I got screamed at: 'We are not housewives Margaret, this is corporate image!'\" </p> <p>Now she spends between \u00a350 and \u00a3150 on each client, sending out 250 presents each year. \"I've learnt that you can't scrimp, because what we'd be saying is 'We don't value you as a client.' I am quite choosy now: whereas some companies might think it is impressive to send say, an entire crate of wine, I'd rather give something which is small but exquisite.\" </p> <p>This year, Margaret has done all the shopping on the net. \"I tried to do the same last year, but it just seemed impossible. I don't know whether there wasn't the selection, or perhaps I just wasn't so adept at using the internet ...\" This time round though, she's hit lucky with the website globalgiftz.com, which boasts a rather fine line of unusual luxury items. There are cufflinks from Sphinks, scented aromatherapy cushions from Crabtree &amp; Evelyn and Green's Select hampers, of which Margaret has ordered several. She believes it gives clients a break from the standard bottle of vino or box of swanky chocolates, and allows her to avoid the chaos of high street shopping in the festive season. </p> <p>Then there are the employees. In the lead up to Christmas, businesses receive loads of catalogues and free samples of pens, mugs, manicure sets and tea towels, which, for a small sum, can be imprinted with the company logo. Bizarrely, employees are rarely grateful to receive such tokens of affection. It is indeed a curious fact that a cheap ballpoint pen emblazoned with the company motto does little to inspire loyalty, or even festive cheer among workers. </p> <p>Frantic and distracted businessmen frequently turn to their trusty secretaries and PAs to sort out their personal gifts, too. Elaine, a secretary for a company in Liverpool, is always in charge of buying Christmas and birthday presents for her employer's wife. \"Last year, he gave her perfume. That was easy.\" It's harder choosing gifts for his two daughters. \"They're what you would call spoilt teenagers. Very difficult to buy for. They already have everything they want.\" </p> <p>Harder still is picking a present for his girlfriend. \"He said he wanted to give her underwear, so I got out the Rigby &amp; Peller catalogue.\" And did he, er, specify any particular requirements? - \"Elaine, fax this report to our New York office, find me the file on the Jones account, and I'd like you to buy a red PVC basque for my bit on the side.\" \"No, he just gave me some measurements, and told me she was dark-haired and olive-skinned. So I bought some creamy lacy underwear.\" </p> <p>Adding to the responsibility is the burden of knowledge that she is somehow aiding her boss's infidelities. \"I feel for his wife,\" she confides \"because I've been in that position.\" </p> <p>Alex, a PA to an advertising executive, agrees. \"It always seems sad that his girlfriend gets the racy underwear and his wife's getting the same old bottle of Chanel No 5 year in, year out. I don't even know if she wears Chanel.\" Would she ever suggest an alternative gift? \"Oh no. She'd probably get suspicious wouldn't she? He's been buying her perfume for donkey's years, and suddenly she's getting La Perla knickers. Any woman in her right mind would know there was something funny going on.\" </p> <p>Behind the facade though, there is little doubt that the Missus has twigged that it's not her beloved husband who nipped into the local perfumery in his lunch break. \"I'm sure she knew,\" says Linda, who has worked in the PR department of a glass manufacturer in the north west for 11 years. She, too, has felt the strain of her buying power. \"It was difficult, you were buying a present for someone you may have met only a handful of times, and you are mak ing what is supposed to be a personal preference for her. But he just left it to me, and she seemed to like whatever I got.\" </p> <p>Not all gifts are so successful. A survey carried out in 1999 by Office Angels revealed that two-thirds of corporate gifts are thrown away, and 20%will be rewrapped and given to other people. The most loathed presents include cheap wine (although surely it brings back fond memories of the office party?) and novelty Christmas tomfoolery, such as those really wacky Santa Claus ties, and those vastly amusing musical socks. You simply never tire of hearing a tinny rendition of Jingle Bells swirling round your ankles.

One in three of those questioned had never been to a gallery while 41% said modern art made them switch off because they did not understand it. Half of the 1,000 people surveyed by Pizza Express to launch its Prospects 2001 art prize, said they could not differentiate between Brit art's Hirst and footballer Hurst. The results reflect concerns about the unpopularity of modern art aired by Tate director Sir Nicholas Serota last month. He suggested many were sceptical because they were not given enough opportunities to experience it. Tate Modern, in London, attracted 6m visitors in its first three months. But other collections are withering because curators cannot afford new exhibits, Sir Nicholas suggested.",

From the mid-1950s, Giacomelli began to win photographic prizes and exhibit in group shows.

A rash of major text evaluations of him appeared, written by such known names as Mark Haworth-Booth, Petr Tausk, Jean-Claude Lemagny, Claudio Adorni and the French novelist Herve Guibert.

I sat behind the UK high commissioner, Alan Jones, and the commander of the British forces in Sierra Leone, Brigadier David Richards. The praise for Britain was so warm and effusive it was almost embarrassing. But it was deeply touching. A Muslim MP said: \"The British are a special people ready to live and to die for what they believe in, rather than for short-term gain.\" He mentioned the British belief in fair play and justice and added in for good measure the spirit of King Arthur. An MP stood up and said: \"I could see the great spectacle on the beach from my window. When I saw the British forces landing - nothing could be more reassuring. If I may quote Wellington, 'I don't know what they do to the enemy, but by God they put the fear of God in me.'\" Members of parliament from all the political parties offered paeans of praise to Britain. They thanked Tony Blair. They thanked Robin Cook. They thanked Britain's UN ambassador, Jeremy Greencroft. They thanked the Department for International Development. They even praised the deputy prime minister, John Prescott. It must be one of the few rave reviews our minister for transport and wet and every other controversial thing has had this year.",

More than a decade later, the child's mother, Shanika Edwards, is hoping that someone may finally have to answer for what went wrong with the investigation and that she might even find out what happened to her child. If she does, it will be as a direct result of the Lawrences' doggedness.</p> <p>\"She said she was coming forward now because of them,\" says Khan. He believes that the Lawrence case has inspired many people who had otherwise given up hope of justice. \"It is a potentially massive area. In the past, victims of crime would never go to a lawyer. They would go to their MP or to a support agency, but never a lawyer. And even if they did, the lawyers would say, 'There's nothing we can do'.\"</p> <p>The Lawrence case changed all that. It demonstrated that there may be plenty a lawyer can do. In Khan's office, the words \"it can't be done\" are banned.

Now, even some doctors acknowledge that such cases play a key role in making the NHS accountable. Khan is hoping for a similar shift in culture among other bodies, including the police and prison service. The knowledge that a victim's family's solicitor is watching what they do will, he hopes, help to ensure that the police conduct all investigations in a methodical and even-handed way, rather than allowing prejudice to colour what they do.</p> <p>There are some inherent difficulties to be overcome, not least the problem of funding. Much work has to be done free of charge because there is no state help available. \"That's why I've gone grey,\" says 36-year-old Khan. \"You end up working longer and longer hours.\" At his new firm, the work will be cross-subsidised by more mainstream civil liberties cases for which there is state funding, such as immigration and actions against the police, and by the criminal defence work he still does.</p> <p>Another difficulty is the lack of any formal rules of engagement. The police may not like solicitors acting in their traditional role of protecting defendants' interests, but defence solicitors are at least grudgingly accepted and everyone knows what the ground rules are supposed to be. Solicitors acting for victims or their families, like Khan intends doing, are on wholly uncharted territory. In the Lawrence case, says Khan, the police didn't trust him or accept that he had any right to ask questions on the family's behalf.</p> <p>On the other hand, if the police try to be too helpful, they might end up revealing information which could compromise the integrity of any subsequent prosecution - the last thing a family would want.

What is needed, he says, is a code of conduct so that all parties know what their roles are supposed to be.</p> <p>But at least one difficulty has been removed.

An aircraft proximity (airprox) report has been filed with the civil aviation authority concerning the incident involving a Britannia Airways Boeing 757, with 234 passengers on board, and the US air force F15 fighter, the CAA confirmed last night. It took place eight miles west of Daventry on November 22 and was deemed to be so \"significantly serious\" that a second inquiry has been launched - by the air accidents investigation branch. It is understood that at one point the two planes were only 100ft from each other. \"The report from the pilot or the air traffic controller must have suggested it was a particularly serious incident for this to happen,\" a CAA spokeswoman said. The Britannia Airways jet was en route to Paphos, Cyprus, and was under London area air traffic control as it flew at 10,000ft at 10.17am. Investigations will focus on why the USAF fighter-bomber, which was based at RAF Lakenheath, in Suffolk, did not show up on the commercial jet's traffic collision avoidance system (TCAS). A Britannia spokeswoman said flight BY444A was travelling at 600ft a second when the F15 was seen from the flight deck. \"It was in very close proximity, and obviously it was a very serious incident. \"The passengers were unaware of the situation. There was a lot of cloud in the area at the time. I cannot confirm whether there were any avoidance measures taken. \"The TCAS system was checked for faults at the time and again on landing, but none were found. Military planes usually do show up on the system, and we would like to know what happened in this case. It is of concern to all airlines that this sort of situation could have occurred.\" David Learmount, a safety specialist with Flight International magazine, said the incident was of particular concern because the Daventry area was among the busiest controlled airspaces in England, forming the hub of the main north/south airways for the British Isles. All airliners are legally required to have a TCAS system, and other air traffic that enters controlled airspace has to be fitted with a transponder unit which gives out an identification signal at the very least, he said. \"It is clear that the pilot did get a real fright. He knew he went very close. It was the kind of close that any manoeuvring you did would not have made a difference. \"What this means is one of three things: either the TCAS system on the Britannia jet was turned off, the transponder on the F15 was turned off, or it was faulty. It does not matter which was the case, it was wrong.\" He added: \"The other question which still remains is that there is no question that the Britannia flight would have been in touch with air traffic control, but why didn't they know about the military aeroplane?\" The incident is certain to fuel fears about overcrowded skies in Britain and will give ammunition to opponents of the government's plan to part-privatise the national air traffic control system. Mr Learmount, however, insisted that there was no reason to panic about the possibility of such events becoming more common under the proposed arrangements. \"There is no evidence in the aviation industry to suggest that privatisation leads to danger,\" he said.",

      "bodyText": "Israel stopped trying to block the international fact-finding mission led by the former US senator George Mitchell yesterday as a Palestinian electrician became the latest innocent victim of snipers. An aide to the prime minister said Israel would cooperate with the mission \"fully and entirely transparently.\" Shahada al-Jafari, 26, an electrician with two children and a third on the way, was shot dead by a sniper as he leaned out of a fifth-floor window in a half-built block of flats near Ramallah. The Israeli army said his death was a mistake. Its rare admission of error came four weeks after the security forces began hunting down leaders of the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's Fatah movement. Mr Mitchell is expected to submit his report on the nine weeks of violence, which has claimed almost 300 lives, in March. The building where Jarafi was shot has become notorious in the past nine weeks: overlooking a key junction on the outskirts of Ramallah, it has been regularly shelled and machine-gunned by Israeli forces trying to take out the Palestinian snipers firing from its upper storeys. Because it was the first Saturday of the holy month of Ramadan, there was no stone-throwing or shooting, and the junction was considered safe enough for more than a dozen men to turn up for work. Jafari stopped by the window for a chat with a linesman perched on a telephone pole below his window. Azzam abu al-Wafa, 20, his assistant, said: \"All of a sudden I saw smoke. He grabbed me, and threw me on the floor, and said: 'Ah, something hit me'.\" At first the army said that its snipers had shot Jafari after mistaking a drill in his hand That version is at odds with the story told by the other workers on site, including Mr Wafa. \"Our kind of job does not need a drill or a hammer,\" he said. \"If a sniper can distinguish between the eye of a child and the eye of a man from 300 metres, then surely he can tell the difference between a drill and a gun.\" Later yesterday the army offered a different version of events: that the dead man bore a resemblance to known Palestinian gunmen. \"The Palestinian who was shot was identified in one of the Palestinian shooting positions in the building, and was thought to be one of the shooters. He was then fired on by an IDF force,\" said a statement yesterday. It repeated a standing warning to Palestinians to stay away from the killing zones. Outside his parents' home in Beituniya, the mourners were turning Jafari into a martyr yesterday. Posters of him were plastered all along the road. The martyrs of Ramadan are said to be doubly blessed, but such traditions bring no comfort to the electrician's widow. Nanees Jafari holds out little hope that the violence will bring about a Palestinian state. \"The killing will end one day, maybe in two, three, or four months, maybe a year,\" she said. \"And after that ... people will dance and have fun. But the people who have lost someone will never stop crying.\" \u0095 The Lebanese interior minister, Ghazi al-Ariri, has accused the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak of trying to distract attention from Israel's internal political crises by threatening to attack Lebanon and Syria. He was quoted in the newspaper al-Mustaqbal yesterday as saying: \"Israel is threatening us because it wants to get out of the crisis it is stuck in.\"",

The trouble with the European \"project\" is that there isn't a project; the trouble with the federal superstate conspiracy is that there isn't a plan, let alone a conspiracy; and the trouble with Nice this week is not that it will agree on too much, but that it will disagree about almost everything that matters.</p> <p>Take one small item from the bottom of this summit agenda: the charter of fundamental rights, otherwise known (in conspiracy-speak) as the superstate's embryo constitution. Have we, British timbers duly shivering, anything to fear from it? It's hard, from the text, to think so - for the words on paper are bromide and windy aspiration mixed. You may, if you don't like trades unions, grow mildly pensive. You may even dislike a rights-based culture which invents the \"right\" of Joe Public to demand that EU officials are always cheery and polite when you meet them over the counter or call them on the phone. But where's the harm or the threat? If Tony Blair signed on the dotted line on Friday, nothing would change in the way we govern ourselves or go about our business.</p> <p>Yet he won't, in any meaningful sense, sign. It may be a rather vapid document designed, almost as a PR exercise, to remind current or future member states - especially the new countries of newish democratic provenance queuing to get in - that their citizens need treating with respect, but it is yet another hot potato.</p> <p>Why this charter, when there's already a European charter of human rights? Wouldn't the judges in Luxembourg - as opposed to the judges in Strasbourg - soon start to throw their weight around? Could it really be the first rough draft of a Euro-constitution? And even if it isn't, surely the lawyers will soon start to cite chunks of it as they spin their interminable webs? The best we can hope for from Nice is that the assembled leaders will \"solemnly proclaim\" the 55 articles as things which are supposed to happen already and should, on the whole, wherever possible, go on happening. More verbal sludge.</p> <p>I went, the other day, to a special international conference on this docile document. There were leaders there from the Council of Europe (the second, older European body we did so much to create after the war and then consigned to Brit oblivion). One of them was quite keen on the charter because it might, indeed, form the basis of an EU constitution some day. One German from the European parliament was less keen on that. Another - an expert who'd help put the articles together - thought it should at least have the background force of law. A battling Austrian reacted in horror.</p> <p>In sum, at the heart of this mini-debate, there wasn't a whiff of consensus. Public relations or public policy? A step on the road to integration or a vital tool for drawing lines against further integration? Legally clear or just solemn'n'binding? These weren't sceptical Englishmen clutching their Daily Mails to quivering bosoms. They were, all of them, mainland Europe movers and shakers. They agreed about very little - only that the \"secret text\" had been drawn up lugubriously over many months by a multinational team of experts (including British experts, announced on appointment) so obsessed with security that they'd posted their various versions on a website as they went along.</p> <p>Yet what is this feeble charter, seen from our island home? Another sinister plot; another twist of the federal ratchet. Mr Blair dives for cover. And the simple point grows its own complexity. We can't believe that there is no hidden agenda. We see another malign length of rope woven by our European partners to drag us ever deeper into the quagmire. We are suspicious in principle because we know there's a conspiracy. Fear comes easy: understanding is more difficult.</p> <p>But reflect. This isn't an attitude that remotely transfers to other large, diffuse organisations full of disagreements. We don't think that there is a Conservative party \"plot\" to package and promote Euro-hysteria because we know that the present, inchoate bunch of shadows couldn't organise a piss-up in William Hague's favourite brewery. Political parties ought to be tightly-knit propaganda and policy machines, but in fact they're squabbling agglomerations of malcontents and back-stabbers. There might - at a stretch of the imagination - be a plot to topple Mr Hague. There couldn't be a party plot to gull you and me. The boys aren't up to it.</p> <p>And if that is true of the Tories, it is true of other organisations all around. A plot to bury global warming? Not when John Prescott stomps centre stage. A plot to drive people on to the roads? That must be the Railtrack conspiracy. A plot to spread BSE? A plot to make sure American democracy hangs by a chad? Most of the time - as journalists or readers - we scoff at conspiracy theories: most of the time we know a cock-up when we stumble on to a slow train from Nottingham. But the slow train from Brussels is curiously different. There, only there, we are victims in waiting as the strands of doom enfold us.</p> <p>In reality, Nice is yet another cock-up waiting to happen. Reweighting national votes will be a temporary bodge - as usual. Refettling the commission will flout every normal canon of effective administration - as usual. Cutting back the ve toes will be torrid illogic - as usual. The problem for the Europe we have, whether at its heart or at its crotch, is that there is no settled plan and thus no possible plot. There is only muddling through - as usual. Bring the \"experts\" together and dissonance reigns.</p> <p>That is what makes this non-debate so damnably difficult for Tony Blair. The phobes can construct their awful visions, but he can only throw his two pennyworth about second chambers into the melting pot. He can neither propound nor defend a defined position, because no such position exists. Maybe Chirac is right - or perhaps Jospin will win the argument. Maybe France and Germany will get it together - or Germany's greater population (and burgeoning economic empire to the east) has finally unbalanced that partnership.</p> <p>A booklet out this week from the Foreign Policy Centre makes the point more eloquently than any polemicist. The foreign ministers of France, Sweden and Germany, the premiers of Britain and Italy, outline their visions: and they are all different. The Europe of Nice is a building-site waiting for new master builders, clutching the euro as an act of faith and hoping that monetary union will bring other changes of clarity and constitutional reform in its wake. No need to despair; every need to become engaged. But simple understanding? That is where, alas, we may lose the plot.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:peter.preston@theguardian.com\">peter.preston@theguardian.com</a></p>",

It is a part of daily life in Northern Ireland, and people on the mainland are used to seeing armed officers at airports, City of London checkpoints and siege incidents.</p> <p>But since Nottinghamshire police put armed officers on the beat, forces around the country have been watching closely. The officers and community leaders I spoke to in Nottingham admit there is no going back.</p> <p>And the precedent it sets for the rest of the country is not lost on the local population. \"This is a watershed,\" says Delroy Brown, a community leader at the Afro-Caribbean national artistic centre in St Ann's. The district is racially mixed, but most of the recent violence has involved black youths.</p> <p>Brown does not dispute the need to do something, but wonders whether the police have thought through the race-relations implications of their actions. \"This marks the paramilitarisation of the police. If they are armed, within five years you will see a disproportionate number of black youths being killed by mainly white officers.\"</p> <p>The police are sensitive to such fears. They insist the decision was taken only after considerable consultation with the council and residents. Price is adamant that the community is united across all ethnic groups - white, black and Asian - in supporting the move. He and his officers on the ground say there was no racial element in the violence and there is no racial element in the response.</p> <p>According to Inspector David Powell, chief inspector of operations, the use of guns is only part of a broader strategy of combating criminality and drug dealing. The police and the council are targeting resources at the youngest gang members - around 12 years old - in an effort to stop a downward spiral into crime.</p> <p>\"We're trying to give communities the confidence to stand up against violent behaviour,\" he says during a guided tour of the locations in St Ann's and the Meadows where the shootings occurred.</p> <p>At first glance the Meadows seems an unlikely guinea pig for tough policing. There are no high-rise blocks: it is a collection of one- and two-storey houses subdivided into flats, with small paths and cul-de-sacs. But for all the people-friendly intentions, the design has only encouraged criminality. Getaways are easy along the maze of narrow, dark pedestrian lanes.</p> <p>He shows me the spot in Abbotsford Road where one victim was shot in January as he was cycling home after midnight. Three youths had been trailing him in a Vauxhall Cavalier. One of them shot him in the stomach with a shotgun, causing serious injuries. It was one of nine shootings in just over a fortnight.</p> <p>\"We're trying to wean residents off a culture of acceptance, from just shrugging their shoulders,\" Powell says. His force is developing \"information-sharing protocols\" - encouraging people to snitch, sometimes through a third party if they are not comfortable approaching the police.</p> <p>In both districts the trouble only begins at night. At dusk the six officers assemble at the force control room. They check their weapons and ammunition as they receive their instructions. Then they make the 20-minute drive into the city. Some nights they are armed, some not. When they are, they are under orders not to hide their weaponry as they tread the narrow alleys of the Meadows, and the wider, more exposed streets of St Ann's.</p> <p>The streets are very empty. For weeks now, there has been little for them to do. The show of force seems to have persuaded the gangs that used to roam the streets to keep out of sight - at least for the time being.</p> <p>Black community leader William Stewart wonders whether, long term, it will work. \"It's heavy-handed,\" he says. The strategy will not tackle the real problem: \"None of us, least of all the police, is getting through to the kids. The ones involved in crime are the ones who are not being reached.\" We are sitting in the local pub, The Poets' Corner. Its owners have agreed with police that it should open only in daytime. At nights the potential for violence is too great. The evening before we met, the greengrocer's next door had been burned down.</p> <p>Nottingham is not exceptional. Its gangland problems do not rival those of Manchester or other major cities. Many locals point out that Nottingham is a vibrant city, with a resurgent cultural life and new buildings going up. According to Alan Simpson, MP for Nottingham South, increasing disparity in wealth in the city is one of the main causes of the problem.</p> <p>The police, he says, \"have been hung out to dry. They're trying to tackle a problem that's as much economic as anything else. Many of the regeneration and retraining schemes for areas like St Ann's and the Meadows are short-lived. The money moves on as quickly as it arrives.\"</p> <p>Several community leaders I speak to, as well as the local Baptist and Anglican priests in St Ann's, say that while the police were assiduous in consulting about Operation Real Estate in general, they were not entirely open about the specific decision to bear firearms.</p> <p>The police say that some people are being selective with their memories; that everything was done to inform them, from pieces in local papers and community newsletters to public meetings. It was only when the issue came to national prominence that \"certain people in Nottingham, who had been behind it, began to criticise it for their own political agendas,\" says one police official.</p> <p>The problem for the police now is that they could be locked into a strategy from which there is little escape. Each Friday, Price and his team carry out a progress report, partly on the basis of intelligence gleaned from the community. For the past few weeks he has concluded that the threat of violence has receded, and ordered his men to leave their weapons in the ARVs. But this, he makes clear, can change week by week.</p> <p>So far, so good. Crime rates are down, criticism is muted. The figures are impressive. Since the operation began there have been only a handful of shooting incidents. More than 150 arrests have been made; a number of trials are about to begin. About 15 guns have been recovered.</p> <p>But as with any deterrent, it only works if the other side knows that you are prepared to use it. And what if the unthinkable happens - someone is shot by the police during the operation? \"The first time anything goes wrong it'll be the last time the strategy has any credibility,\" says Simpson.</p> <p>Dr Karim Murji, a criminologist at the Open University, believes British policing is at a crossroads. \"This debate about guns is part of the mythology of British policing,\" he says. \"We are in fact much further down the line than most people realise. The experience of the last two decades shows that it's impossible to roll back on arming levels once they have been established.\"</p> <p>The main worry seems to be that we will go the way of the US, where easy access to weapons produces a more trigger-happy police culture.

      "body": "<p>Mark Berenson could see no reason to decline when he was invited to take part in an academic conference in Peru. As a professor of statistics and the author of several standard works on his subject, there was nothing to stop him.</p> <p>Nothing, that is, except his daughter Lori. \"She wouldn't let me go. She said: 'It's too dangerous, you'll stand out like a tall American and they'll shoot you first and ask the questions second.' So I didn't go.\"</p> <p>He didn't, but some time later she did. Now his 30-year-old daughter has been living in a prison cell for the past five years.</p> <p>Peru says that Lori Berenson is a guerrilla, guilty of treason. Her parents, Mark and Rhoda, say that she is being used as a symbol of Peru's commitment to crushing terrorism and its determination to stand up to the United States. Each of them has visited her about 40 times in the past two years, every round trip costing $1,400.</p> <p>The Berensons live in a pleasant flat in Gramercy Park, Manhattan, the very picture of liberal respectability. The sitting room, which opens on to a terrace, contains four chess sets, a gallery of family photographs and an L-shaped sofa inhabited by a large brown teddy bear.</p> <p>But this image of decent lives spent as college professors - Mrs Berenson taught physics - is shattered by the Free Lori Berenson posters spilling out of cardboard boxes in one corner of the room and the letters of support for their daughter scattered on a glass-topped table.</p> <p>Both parents retired early so that they could concentrate on trying to win Lori's freedom. Now her 58-year-old father has time for little else, and Rhoda Berenson can switch off just long enough to read a book on her frequent flights. He seethes and erupts, she maintains a shoulder-shrugging mock bemusement.</p> <p><b>Indignities</b><br></p> <p>\"I used to think of myself as a caring person,\" Mr Berenson says, waving away arguments and counting off indignities on his fingers. \"But I was a couch potato and I have to be honest and say: 'Would I have personally been there for someone else's daughter?'\"</p> <p>Rhoda, 57, might have been.

      "bodyText": "Mark Berenson could see no reason to decline when he was invited to take part in an academic conference in Peru. As a professor of statistics and the author of several standard works on his subject, there was nothing to stop him. Nothing, that is, except his daughter Lori. \"She wouldn't let me go. She said: 'It's too dangerous, you'll stand out like a tall American and they'll shoot you first and ask the questions second.' So I didn't go.\" He didn't, but some time later she did. Now his 30-year-old daughter has been living in a prison cell for the past five years. Peru says that Lori Berenson is a guerrilla, guilty of treason. Her parents, Mark and Rhoda, say that she is being used as a symbol of Peru's commitment to crushing terrorism and its determination to stand up to the United States. Each of them has visited her about 40 times in the past two years, every round trip costing $1,400. The Berensons live in a pleasant flat in Gramercy Park, Manhattan, the very picture of liberal respectability. The sitting room, which opens on to a terrace, contains four chess sets, a gallery of family photographs and an L-shaped sofa inhabited by a large brown teddy bear. But this image of decent lives spent as college professors - Mrs Berenson taught physics - is shattered by the Free Lori Berenson posters spilling out of cardboard boxes in one corner of the room and the letters of support for their daughter scattered on a glass-topped table. Both parents retired early so that they could concentrate on trying to win Lori's freedom. Now her 58-year-old father has time for little else, and Rhoda Berenson can switch off just long enough to read a book on her frequent flights. He seethes and erupts, she maintains a shoulder-shrugging mock bemusement. Indignities \"I used to think of myself as a caring person,\" Mr Berenson says, waving away arguments and counting off indignities on his fingers. \"But I was a couch potato and I have to be honest and say: 'Would I have personally been there for someone else's daughter?'\" Rhoda, 57, might have been. Just as the Berensons rely on the support of others now, she was involved previously in Amnesty International and the American Civil Liberties Union. Lori Berenson was clever at school - everybody's favourite, says her father; never a rebel, says her mother - and her classmates included the actress Jennifer Aniston and Chastity Bono, Cher's daughter. But the young Lori was less interested in nascent celebrity than in developing her social conscience. At 14 she recorded a voiceover for the international relief agency Care and when she went to college became active in Latin-American causes. She visited Nicaragua and made two more trips to Central America before dropping out of school and into what she considered real life. She went to El Salvador in 1992 and then, two years later, Peru, where she intended to work as a journalist. There she moved into a house in Lima where her fellow occupants included members of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA). Mrs Berenson says: \"She has leftist ideological views that she shares, sometimes parallel to MRTA, but she's not a person who believes in violence and terrorism.\" It is an evaluation sharply at variance with that of the Peruvian government. The police raided the house on November 30 1995, and by next day one person was dead, three were badly wounded, four hostages were freed and 21 alleged members of MRTA were under arrest. Elsewhere in the city there was a general sweep for suspects. Lori Berenson, who by this time had moved out of the house, was arrested on a bus and six weeks later received a life sentence for treason, plotting to attack the Peruvian congress, transporting weapons, and instructing militants.

      "bodyText": "Nelson Mandela has been accused of \"playing the race card\" when he called supporters of the official opposition party \"black stooges [of] white bosses\" in the runup to tomorrow's elections to a new level of big-city government. His denunciation of black supporters of the Democratic Alliance reflects the African National Congress's annoyance that the white-oriented opposition is apparently likely to do well in the ballot to decide who will govern the \"megacities\", which incorporate previously white-only cities and their surrounding black townships into single administrations. Opinion polls show the alliance, an amalgamation of the old liberal Democratic party and the formerly apartheid National party, close to victory in Johannesburg, Cape Town, Pretoria and Durban. To the ANC's chagrin, it seems to be picking up support in townships such as Soweto, where there is a growing disenchantment with corruption in the new establishment. \"You must not be misled by a party that only cares for blacks on the eve of the elections. No white party can run this country ... no matter how they cover up by getting a few black stooges,\" Mr Mandela said at a rally in Johannesburg. The DA responded that more than half its candidates were black. \"President Mbeki is so unpopular that the ANC decided not to wheel him out for the attack but to allow him to hide behind the old man,\" it said. \"The difference between the ANC and us is that they are not interested in blacks at any time during or outside the elections.\" According to an opinion poll by Markinor, support for the ANC in Johannesburg has dropped below 50% for the first time: 44% compared with 33% support for the alliance. In Cape Town, the alliance led 40% to 28%, but one in five voters said they were undecided. The contest is also close in Pretoria and Durban. The real embarrassment to the ANC is that the alliance is picking up votes among black people at all when it includes some of the most notorious apologists for apartheid, and after it ran a thinly disguised racist presidential campaign last year. But if the opinion polls are correct it has made inroads even in Soweto and other townships which were once considered so solidly ANC that in the last local elections five years ago the opposition parties hardly bothered to campaign there. Although some Soweto residents say they are disillusioned by the ANC's failure to make good on its promises to provide new houses and jobs and curb crime, the principal concern of many is abuse of power and incompetence, particularly by local councillors. The ANC admits that there is a problem. An internal audit concluded that one in five of its councillors was either corrupt or unfit to hold office. The party is campaigning on a promise that all such politicians will be fired, as well as a guarantee of free water and electricity to the poorest. Mr Mbeki's standing has fallen because be questions the link between HIV and Aids, but there is so far no evidence that this is an important factor in the dissatisfaction with the ANC as a party. The government is also at odds with traditional chiefs, who say that the reorganisation of local government strips them of many of their powers. Mr Mbeki has tried to reassure them that their concerns will be addressed after the ballot, but they remain reluctant to back the ANC. The unions have urged their members to vote ANC, but some public employees on strike for better pay have other plans. In Durban, the prominent anti-apartheid activist Fatima Meer says the ANC is losing the Indian vote by failing to address poverty in the community. \"Indians as a whole have become disenchanted with the ANC,\" she said. \"The chances of Indians voting for the ANC are very slim.

      "byline": "Gareth McLean",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Never trust a boulder. That's the lesson to learn from <strong> Lions - Spy in the Den</strong> (BBC1, Sun), a run-of-the-mill documentary, notwithstanding its ingenious (but oddly cartoonish) central premise - a camera hidden inside a boulder with wheels. Sounds like something that would happen on Scooby-Doo, doesn't it (\"and I'd have got away with it if it hadn't been for you pesky kids\")? </p> <p>While the cutesy-wutesy lion cubs capered and canoodled, the boulder saw all, dutifully scurrying after them like a private detective on speed. The bouldercam's camouflage did provide an opportunity to glimpse the everyday life of the lions, something which would have been unthinkable had David Attenborough been hanging around. </p> <p>But what we - and the boulder - witnessed wasn't groundbreaking or breathtaking. It was lions lyin' around and doin' other lion-ish things. A unique perspective it may have been - a fly-on-the-dung-heap documentary, if you will - but, like its human equivalents, it proved altogether pedestrian, despite the wheels. </p> <p>Far from pedestrian was an extraordinary <strong> Panorama </strong> (BBC1, Sun) which carried the first television interview with a supergrass. Or a supergrass in his official grassing capacity, at least. As we know from the shenanigans down Sun Hill way lately, there ain't nuffink worse than a bent coppa - and Neil Putnam was exactly that. </p> <p>During eight years of a 20-year career, he stole, extorted and dealt drugs - all from the safety of East Dulwich, where the South East Regional Crime Squad was based. Carrying a warrant card with the authority invested in him from on high, and imbued with a trust from the public to do the right thing, Putnam acted with impunity - lining pockets, settling scores and betraying those who believed in him. S</p> <p>peaking candidly after his release from prison, Putnam may have been an untrustworthy narrator of events, but he was worth listening to, telling, as he did, a story which affects us all.

      "bodyText": "Never trust a boulder. That's the lesson to learn from Lions - Spy in the Den (BBC1, Sun), a run-of-the-mill documentary, notwithstanding its ingenious (but oddly cartoonish) central premise - a camera hidden inside a boulder with wheels. Sounds like something that would happen on Scooby-Doo, doesn't it (\"and I'd have got away with it if it hadn't been for you pesky kids\")? While the cutesy-wutesy lion cubs capered and canoodled, the boulder saw all, dutifully scurrying after them like a private detective on speed. The bouldercam's camouflage did provide an opportunity to glimpse the everyday life of the lions, something which would have been unthinkable had David Attenborough been hanging around. But what we - and the boulder - witnessed wasn't groundbreaking or breathtaking. It was lions lyin' around and doin' other lion-ish things. A unique perspective it may have been - a fly-on-the-dung-heap documentary, if you will - but, like its human equivalents, it proved altogether pedestrian, despite the wheels. Far from pedestrian was an extraordinary Panorama (BBC1, Sun) which carried the first television interview with a supergrass. Or a supergrass in his official grassing capacity, at least. As we know from the shenanigans down Sun Hill way lately, there ain't nuffink worse than a bent coppa - and Neil Putnam was exactly that. During eight years of a 20-year career, he stole, extorted and dealt drugs - all from the safety of East Dulwich, where the South East Regional Crime Squad was based. Carrying a warrant card with the authority invested in him from on high, and imbued with a trust from the public to do the right thing, Putnam acted with impunity - lining pockets, settling scores and betraying those who believed in him. S peaking candidly after his release from prison, Putnam may have been an untrustworthy narrator of events, but he was worth listening to, telling, as he did, a story which affects us all. He didn't just relate a tale of corrupt policemen and women doing us all a disservice, he also charted the onset of corruption in himself and others, exposing the anatomy of venality. While we deplore the unscrupulousness of those who purport to uphold law and order, our ire towards the corrupt is fuelled by a loathing of a weakness we all have - we are all corruptible, whether in financial, emotional or psychological terms. Corruption is an insidious disease, one which creeps up on the unsuspecting whatever their profession or circumstance, and eats away like soul cancer.

      "body": "<p>\u0095 This is a tale of how, through no one's fault, one of the most controversial cases of recent months was reported in a way which misled everyone. It was the claim of the South Yorkshire couple that they should be compensated because the IVF treatment the wife underwent resulted in triplets rather than the one or two babies the couple wanted.</p> <p>The judge's decision was reported prominently and correctly in the media as a win for the parents - their contract with the fertility clinic specified that only two embryos were to be inserted so the clinic, by placing three, had breached the contract. So far so good. But the impression given was that the parents were going to get a substantial payout - an outcome which provoked intense criticism from just about everyone I spoke to.</p> <p>But the reality is different. A week after the judge's highly publicised decision, he released his detailed reasons, which were given very little publicity. It turns out not only that the compensation hasn't yet been decided but that the judge has left open the possibility that the couple may get nothing at all.</p> <p>I have canvassed the views of a number of lawyers who know their stuff in this field and there seems to be a consensus that the parents are probably not entitled to anything.

      "bodyText": "\u0095 This is a tale of how, through no one's fault, one of the most controversial cases of recent months was reported in a way which misled everyone. It was the claim of the South Yorkshire couple that they should be compensated because the IVF treatment the wife underwent resulted in triplets rather than the one or two babies the couple wanted. The judge's decision was reported prominently and correctly in the media as a win for the parents - their contract with the fertility clinic specified that only two embryos were to be inserted so the clinic, by placing three, had breached the contract. So far so good. But the impression given was that the parents were going to get a substantial payout - an outcome which provoked intense criticism from just about everyone I spoke to. But the reality is different. A week after the judge's highly publicised decision, he released his detailed reasons, which were given very little publicity. It turns out not only that the compensation hasn't yet been decided but that the judge has left open the possibility that the couple may get nothing at all. I have canvassed the views of a number of lawyers who know their stuff in this field and there seems to be a consensus that the parents are probably not entitled to anything. Why? Because a ruling by the House of Lords last year said, broadly, that an unwanted baby was nevertheless a blessing, not a burden, and that it was contrary to policy to pay compensation to the parents even if the baby was the result of a failed vasectomy or sterilisation caused by medical negligence. (The triplets case is based on a broken contract, not negligence, but I don't see how that changes the general policy.) And even the few thousand pounds usually awarded to a mother for the discomfort of being pregnant when she didn't want to be doesn't apply to the triplet's mother - she was pregnant anyway. But I bet that the vast majority of people who have got all excited over the case will forever continue to believe angrily that the parents of these triplets have walked away with a large sum of money. \u0095 'The vast majority, especially among the eastern Europeans, are tough-looking, lounging, grinning young men ... their fear of persecution is as nothing compared with their fear of soap and water ... the stench has to be smelt to be believed ... one benefit-drawing, night club-frequenting 'refugee' was the proud owner of a \u00a3200 leather jacket,\" and so on, in a vile tone.

      "body": "<p>The debate about devolution appears to be facing up at last to the long unanswered question, what to do about England? William Hague declares that only English MPs should vote on English laws at Westminster. Meanwhile, the junior trade minister, Richard Caborn, urges his party to speed up plans for English regional devolution.</p> <p>So what does England itself make of it all? According to new evidence from the latest British Social Attitudes survey, the answer is not much. People in England are happy for Scotland and Wales to have their own parliament or assembly but see no need of the same for themselves. As yet at least, the Conservatives have failed to make a political tide out of English nationalism. Whatever the illogicality of the present devolution settlement, England itself seems happy for the English question to remain unanswered.</p> <p>With devolution in Scotland and Wales now an accomplished fact, few people in England continue to oppose it. Even at the 1997 general election only around a quarter of people in England opposed the idea of their near neighbours being allowed some form of home rule. Now just 13% of people in England oppose the creation of a Scottish parliament while 15% take the same view about a Welsh assembly.</p> <p>But when asked whether they would like devolution for themselves, the answer appears to be a polite, but firm \"no thanks\". No less than 62% say that England should be governed as it is now, with laws made by the UK parliament. Just 18% believe that England as a whole should have its own parliament with law-making powers in similar vein to the Scottish parliament. And only 15% agree that \"each region of England should have its own assembly that runs services like health\", a form of devolution that would be similar to that enjoyed by Wales.</p> <p>So, there is little sign here that resentment at the continued role of Scots MPs in the passage of English legislation is likely to prove a successful rallying cry for Mr Hague. Indeed, despite the lack of Conservative MPs from Scotland or Wales, the Conservative party still has some way to go before it is seen as an English rather than a British institution. Well over half of people in England still regard the Conservative party as at least as much a British as an English party.</p> <p>True, rather more people (36%) regard the Conservatives as predominantly or wholly English than think the same of Labour (19%). But those who think of themselves as English rather than British are no more likely to say they support the Conservatives than are those who think of themselves as British rather than English - or indeed those who simply think of themselves as being a mixture of the two.</p> <p>In short the Conservatives show no sign as yet of actually winning over the votes of those who might be thought of as \"English nationalists\". Mr Hague's apparent failure in this regard is perhaps particularly surprising given that those who are wont to describe themselves as English rather than British are distinctively Eurosceptic. For example around three-quarters of those who describe themselves as English want no truck with the euro, compared with only just over half of those who say they are British.</p> <p>English nationalists also take a rather less liberal view about immigrants and ethnic minorities. No less than seven in ten believe that immigrants take jobs away from people that were born in Britain compared with little more than one in three of those who think of themselves as British. The Commission for Racial Equality recently got into hot water for suggesting that Britishness was associated with racism. It might in fact have been on safer ground if it had made the same charge of Englishness.</p> <p>But if there is little sign as yet that devolution has become a rallying call in England, there are some indications that more people in England are now more willing to think of themselves as English rather than British. As recently as 1997 just 7% said they thought they were \"English, not British\". Now that figure has risen to 17%.</p> <p>It still pales by comparison with the 32% of Scots who think of themselves as \"Scottish, not British\", but there are perhaps signs here that at least some people are coming to feel that being English and being British are not necessarily one and the same thing. There is an interesting regional dimension to this, picked up in a BBC survey - see the chart - published in the first of a series of regional monitoring reports supported by the Economic and Social Research Council.</p> <p>People who think of themselves as being English rather than British show some signs of being less insistent on the maintenance of the Union. They are more likely to back independence for Scotland and Wales than are people in England in general. They are also less likely to express regret at the possibility that Scotland might one day become independent.</p> <p>Here then perhaps is a small warning sign for those who wish to maintain the Union. If England becomes more aware of its Englishness it may be happy to see the rest of the UK slip away, allowing England to be governed as at present. For the moment that remains a distant prospect. Even among English nationalists 59% still believe the government should do everything it can to keep Britain together in a single state.</p> <p>\u0095 John Curtice is deputy director of the ESRC Centre for Research into Elections and Social Trends. <br><br><b>Useful links</b><br>British Social Attitudes, 17th report: <a href=\"http://www.sagepub.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">Sage Publications</a><br>Monitoring the English Regions: <a href=\"http://www.ncl.ac.uk/curds\" target=\"_NEW\">CURD</a></p>",

According to new evidence from the latest British Social Attitudes survey, the answer is not much. People in England are happy for Scotland and Wales to have their own parliament or assembly but see no need of the same for themselves. As yet at least, the Conservatives have failed to make a political tide out of English nationalism. Whatever the illogicality of the present devolution settlement, England itself seems happy for the English question to remain unanswered. With devolution in Scotland and Wales now an accomplished fact, few people in England continue to oppose it. Even at the 1997 general election only around a quarter of people in England opposed the idea of their near neighbours being allowed some form of home rule. Now just 13% of people in England oppose the creation of a Scottish parliament while 15% take the same view about a Welsh assembly. But when asked whether they would like devolution for themselves, the answer appears to be a polite, but firm \"no thanks\". No less than 62% say that England should be governed as it is now, with laws made by the UK parliament. Just 18% believe that England as a whole should have its own parliament with law-making powers in similar vein to the Scottish parliament. And only 15% agree that \"each region of England should have its own assembly that runs services like health\", a form of devolution that would be similar to that enjoyed by Wales. So, there is little sign here that resentment at the continued role of Scots MPs in the passage of English legislation is likely to prove a successful rallying cry for Mr Hague. Indeed, despite the lack of Conservative MPs from Scotland or Wales, the Conservative party still has some way to go before it is seen as an English rather than a British institution. Well over half of people in England still regard the Conservative party as at least as much a British as an English party. True, rather more people (36%) regard the Conservatives as predominantly or wholly English than think the same of Labour (19%). But those who think of themselves as English rather than British are no more likely to say they support the Conservatives than are those who think of themselves as British rather than English - or indeed those who simply think of themselves as being a mixture of the two. In short the Conservatives show no sign as yet of actually winning over the votes of those who might be thought of as \"English nationalists\". Mr Hague's apparent failure in this regard is perhaps particularly surprising given that those who are wont to describe themselves as English rather than British are distinctively Eurosceptic. For example around three-quarters of those who describe themselves as English want no truck with the euro, compared with only just over half of those who say they are British. English nationalists also take a rather less liberal view about immigrants and ethnic minorities. No less than seven in ten believe that immigrants take jobs away from people that were born in Britain compared with little more than one in three of those who think of themselves as British. The Commission for Racial Equality recently got into hot water for suggesting that Britishness was associated with racism. It might in fact have been on safer ground if it had made the same charge of Englishness. But if there is little sign as yet that devolution has become a rallying call in England, there are some indications that more people in England are now more willing to think of themselves as English rather than British. As recently as 1997 just 7% said they thought they were \"English, not British\". Now that figure has risen to 17%. It still pales by comparison with the 32% of Scots who think of themselves as \"Scottish, not British\", but there are perhaps signs here that at least some people are coming to feel that being English and being British are not necessarily one and the same thing. There is an interesting regional dimension to this, picked up in a BBC survey - see the chart - published in the first of a series of regional monitoring reports supported by the Economic and Social Research Council. People who think of themselves as being English rather than British show some signs of being less insistent on the maintenance of the Union. They are more likely to back independence for Scotland and Wales than are people in England in general. They are also less likely to express regret at the possibility that Scotland might one day become independent. Here then perhaps is a small warning sign for those who wish to maintain the Union. If England becomes more aware of its Englishness it may be happy to see the rest of the UK slip away, allowing England to be governed as at present. For the moment that remains a distant prospect. Even among English nationalists 59% still believe the government should do everything it can to keep Britain together in a single state. \u0095 John Curtice is deputy director of the ESRC Centre for Research into Elections and Social Trends.

In essence, its form is two spheres - stage and auditorium - that intersect at the proscenium. The result is a small theatre that still feels grand and ennobling for both actors and audience. </p> <p>It is also an architectural expression of Rada's core values: 34 lucky students among the thousands auditioned between November and June each year come here to learn how to become professional actors, all of them able to perform the classics whether they end up as stand-up comics or screen villains in years to come.

      "body": "<p>One day in 1958, when I was a small 15-year-old bookworm, a Hungarian wandered into our provincial girls' school, offering fencing lessons. Frantic to avoid the brutality of hockey, I volunteered.</p> <p>Mr Fadgyas had fenced in the 1956 Melbourne Olympics. He was terribly impressive, but also funny, sweet and patient. We loved and respected him. When he met our mothers, he clicked his heels and kissed their hands. He was a hard-working immigrant in a tracksuit, but to me he would always be a European nobleman - a hero in white jacket, mask and glove.</p> <p>What he taught was a way of formalising aggression and defence, of making fighting beautiful. The aggression in me was deeply buried. Though I was quick on my feet, I was scared - not of getting hurt, but of attacking. I could learn the moves in class, but in competition I went to water. Once I left home for university, I never picked up a foil again.</p> <p>Until last July, when I spotted a flyer at the library: \"Fencing for Older Adults.\" Something stirred. I pulled on my trainers and drove to the industrial backstreet of inner Melbourne where the Victorian Amateur Fencing Association has its HQ, on the upper level of a huge warehouse. I clanged up the fire escape and found a vast, bare, white space, daylit through the glass of a sawtooth roof. The whole floor was a line of pistes, the raised 14-metre strips on which bouts are fought. There was nobody around. It had the weird, alluring stillness of a place devoted to a formal discipline.</p> <p>Four women turned up to learn. The teacher, Ernie, a chunky 70-year-old in glasses and grey tracksuit, was no Hungarian. I was disappointed, until he seized a foil, raised both arms and fell with easy grace into the en garde position. To see that movement can take your breath away - the authority of it, the quiet readiness.</p> <p>He gave out masks and I pulled one on. The smell of cold wire shot up my nose, so familiar that I thought I was going to faint. \"Pick up the foil lightly,\" said Ernie, \"not with a battle-axe grip!\" It fitted my hand as if I'd laid it down yesterday. He saluted us: heels together, foil to the nose and down to the floor. When he called out: \"En garde!\" my body dropped into the posture of its own accord. I was hooked.</p> <p>After our third lesson, another woman and I sneaked on to the piste. We shaped up. I went for her. She blocked me. I went again. Adrenalin poured through me. I wanted to attack, to be attacked, to have to fight back. The lunges, the sliding clash of metal, the way the sword hand rises as the foil-tip hits the target - it was glorious.</p> <p>We both burst out laughing. We stopped only because she didn't have a glove: I almost struck her hand and she flinched. We lowered the blades. She pulled off her mask. Her eyes were bright, but I saw with a shock how gentle her face was, how feminine, under the cloud of hair.</p> <p>Before the Sydney Games, Olympic fencers from all over the world trained at our Melbourne warehouse. I crouched against a wall, in awe of their speed and power. The way the women screamed as they attacked, like wild beasts at the kill, was unbearably thrilling.</p> <p>Our modest lessons continued weekly. I was vain about the little bruises, like snakebites, on my inner arms. But when the state competition came up, I panicked. I did my level best to wimp out. \"I've been sick,\" I whined to Ernie. \"I've missed three classes.\" He shamed me into a catch-up lesson. \"You may be swift,\" he said sternly, as I stood masked, gloved and panting in his garage, \"but you've got to learn to retreat. Retire! Retreat! Retreat! And eat carbohydrates!\"</p> <p>On the day, the air was humid, the mercury sat on 30. As I climbed the warehouse stairs, I could hear the scampering and the thuds, the cries of protest and triumph, the raised voices of the referees, the soft rhythmic beeping of the electronic scorers. The young fencers, some of them Olympians, sorted each other out, received their medals and went home, trundling great buggies of equipment.</p> <p>Now it was the veterans' turn, a handful of us, mostly well over 50. I knew the others from the class above me, where in practice bouts they all routinely beat me. The wild card was an unknown 45-year-old bloke from a mountain club, heavy-limbed and determined.</p> <p>I was called. Already dripping in five layers of cotton, synthetic, plastic, metal and leather, I stepped up and plugged the scoring lead into my foil. The mask was heavier than the practice one, its wire darker, its holes smaller, its bib more spongily padded. Oh God. How would I breathe in here? Sweat began to trickle through my hair. I wasn't scared I'd get hurt, but I expected to be soundly thrashed.</p> <p>At first I was. My ears muffled by padding, I couldn't understand why the curly-haired young referee kept mouthing and gesturing at me. I thought he was rebuking me for something I was doing wrong. I tore off my mask and he looked at me with a crooked smile. \"I'm telling you,\" he said, in the clear, slow voice one uses to a simpleton, \" who won each point, and why.\"</p> <p>The first penny of the day dropped with a mighty clang. I uttered a crazed laugh and yanked the mask back on. En garde!</p> <p>I was beaten. I won a bout. I lost again. I faced the huge guy from the mountains. He was like a Sherman tank. He came at me with his blade down low and his left hand dangling loosely at shoulder level. I couldn't deal with the bulk of him, his steady, relentless advance. I forgot about \"Retreat! Retire!\" and brandished my feeble blade in his face. He swatted me off like a mosquito. He wiped me out. I shook his hand in bliss.</p> <p>The longer we fenced, the cooler my head became. I felt daring. I didn't care if I lost, but I went all out to win. My mind, normally so scattered and fleeting, tuned itself to my body. I grasped for the first time in my life what tactical thinking might be, how I could vary my attacks, feint and wait and spring a surprise. I saw, in a series of bright flashes, what was required, what I might one day be capable of, if I stuck at this.</p> <p>I was panting, gasping, sweating. I felt like a million dollars. I could have kept going all day and all night. Between bouts I guzzled water but I was too excited to sit down. I paced around with the mask under my arm. I leaned against the fire escape door to get a breath of air. I was streaming with joy.</p> <p>And I won a medal. A bronze medal on a long blue ribbon. Typing this, I've still got it on. The ma\u00eetre d'armes (a woman) presented each of us with champagne and yellow roses. Ernie made me eat a muesli bar. We all, even the victorious monster from the mountains, kissed and shook hands. I laughed and cried all the way home.</p> <p>I'm different since that day. I feel taller, stronger, freer. Suddenly I understand why people scramble and strain in mud on winter Saturdays. The devotion and patience of coaches, their severe heartening - all this is clear to me now. I see the point of sport. At last, at last, I get it.</p> <p>The language of fencing is old French, beautiful and austere. Ernie uses the phrase le sentiment de fer. The feel of steel. That's what I want. I am learning to fight, but not in the ordinary wretched way of the worst of my personal life - desperate, ragged, emotional. I've found an ancient discipline, with formal control and purpose. I'm 58. Will my body hold out? I hope it's not too late.</p>",

I did my level best to wimp out. \"I've been sick,\" I whined to Ernie. \"I've missed three classes.\" He shamed me into a catch-up lesson. \"You may be swift,\" he said sternly, as I stood masked, gloved and panting in his garage, \"but you've got to learn to retreat. Retire! Retreat! Retreat! And eat carbohydrates!\" On the day, the air was humid, the mercury sat on 30. As I climbed the warehouse stairs, I could hear the scampering and the thuds, the cries of protest and triumph, the raised voices of the referees, the soft rhythmic beeping of the electronic scorers. The young fencers, some of them Olympians, sorted each other out, received their medals and went home, trundling great buggies of equipment. Now it was the veterans' turn, a handful of us, mostly well over 50. I knew the others from the class above me, where in practice bouts they all routinely beat me. The wild card was an unknown 45-year-old bloke from a mountain club, heavy-limbed and determined. I was called. Already dripping in five layers of cotton, synthetic, plastic, metal and leather, I stepped up and plugged the scoring lead into my foil. The mask was heavier than the practice one, its wire darker, its holes smaller, its bib more spongily padded. Oh God. How would I breathe in here? Sweat began to trickle through my hair. I wasn't scared I'd get hurt, but I expected to be soundly thrashed. At first I was. My ears muffled by padding, I couldn't understand why the curly-haired young referee kept mouthing and gesturing at me. I thought he was rebuking me for something I was doing wrong. I tore off my mask and he looked at me with a crooked smile. \"I'm telling you,\" he said, in the clear, slow voice one uses to a simpleton, \" who won each point, and why.\" The first penny of the day dropped with a mighty clang. I uttered a crazed laugh and yanked the mask back on. En garde! I was beaten. I won a bout. I lost again. I faced the huge guy from the mountains. He was like a Sherman tank. He came at me with his blade down low and his left hand dangling loosely at shoulder level. I couldn't deal with the bulk of him, his steady, relentless advance. I forgot about \"Retreat! Retire!\" and brandished my feeble blade in his face. He swatted me off like a mosquito. He wiped me out. I shook his hand in bliss. The longer we fenced, the cooler my head became. I felt daring. I didn't care if I lost, but I went all out to win. My mind, normally so scattered and fleeting, tuned itself to my body. I grasped for the first time in my life what tactical thinking might be, how I could vary my attacks, feint and wait and spring a surprise. I saw, in a series of bright flashes, what was required, what I might one day be capable of, if I stuck at this. I was panting, gasping, sweating. I felt like a million dollars. I could have kept going all day and all night. Between bouts I guzzled water but I was too excited to sit down. I paced around with the mask under my arm. I leaned against the fire escape door to get a breath of air. I was streaming with joy. And I won a medal. A bronze medal on a long blue ribbon. Typing this, I've still got it on. The ma\u00eetre d'armes (a woman) presented each of us with champagne and yellow roses. Ernie made me eat a muesli bar. We all, even the victorious monster from the mountains, kissed and shook hands. I laughed and cried all the way home. I'm different since that day. I feel taller, stronger, freer. Suddenly I understand why people scramble and strain in mud on winter Saturdays. The devotion and patience of coaches, their severe heartening - all this is clear to me now. I see the point of sport. At last, at last, I get it. The language of fencing is old French, beautiful and austere. Ernie uses the phrase le sentiment de fer. The feel of steel. That's what I want. I am learning to fight, but not in the ordinary wretched way of the worst of my personal life - desperate, ragged, emotional. I've found an ancient discipline, with formal control and purpose. I'm 58. Will my body hold out? I hope it's not too late.",

The organisers, who had expected a turnout similar to last year's sedate crowd of 2,000 pensioners listening to Cliff Richard singing carols, hardly knew what had hit them.</p> <p>With sales exceeding \u00a3110m, revenues from the series have already overhauled what Teletubbies made in its first year. Tinky-Winky, Laa-Laa and friends have gone on to pull in over \u00a31bn in worldwide merchandising sales (of which about \u00a390m has come back to the BBC in royalties), but the Tweenies are catching up fast: by the end of last month, 1.7m Tweenies videos and 800,000 books had been sold in the UK; the website gets 1m hits a month, and the twice-daily programme broadcasts to audiences of 2m.</p> <p>It has been reported that the second word used by Brooklyn Beckham (that ultimate arbiter of what's hot in pre-school popular culture) after \"mum\" was not \"dad\" - devoted and doting father though Becks evidently is - but \"Tweenies\".</p> <p>A fair few column inches have been expended on the Teletubbies vs Tweenies debate (\"which does your child prefer?\"), but the opposition is bogus: both are BBC products, designed to appeal to different age groups.</p> <p>\"The furore over Teletubbies made people watch children's TV again,\" says one of the Tweenies' makers. \"Teletubbies revealed something that most children's TV makers were not aware of, which is that there are actually layers within the pre-school age group.</p> <p>\"Teletubbies was initially intended to span the whole age range, but it actually appealed to kids up to the age of two, two-and-a-half. And suddenly there was this hole - I think that was a revelation to most people.</p> <p>\"And that was where Tweenies came in - to fill that gap for three- to five-year-olds.\"</p> <p>Kids' TV used to be presenter-led: the model for programme-making was top-down paternalism (remember Playschool and its successor Playdays?). Teletubbies radically dispensed with that format by fronting the show with four multi-coloured, proto-linguistic aliens, with TV screens where their tummy-buttons should have been.</p> <p>The Tweenies develops the new formula by creating more strongly characterised muppet-type figures who are, in attitude and effect, kids - just like their four- and five-year-old viewers. Bella is the oldest and - like the Rugrats' Angelica - the bossiest; frizzy-haired Milo is football-mad; Fizz is a girlie girl, into pink and dancing; and mohican-sporting Jake is the youngest of the gang. The quartet have a dog named Doodles for company, while two adult carers, Max and Judy, keep a discreet distance.</p> <p>Tweenies is a peer-group drama, offering its audience the straightforward reward of identification, while each episode's plot is written as a kind of kindergarten soap - that is its genius. Just add some \"skin actors\" with strong calf muscles to goof about in the hefty cartoon-sized trainers, and some clever animatronics for their faces, et voil\u00e0 ... the Tweenies!</p> <p>So just who is behind our new fuzzy-faced friends? The short answer is Dame Trot and an Ugly Sister. Iain Lauchlan and Will Brenton are two former jobbing actors and panto veterans. For 11 consecutive years (up to and including last year), the pair wrote, directed and starred in the Christmas pantomime at Coventry's Belgrade Theatre - experience which has proved invaluable (and extremely lucrative) in devising the Tweenies' arena show. I met the duo recently at their offices at Elstree studios in Hertfordshire.</p> <p>Brenton, the younger at 38, with a goatee and long, flowing hair, seems the more dynamic, dominant partner of the duo, taking the lead in answering questions.</p> <p>Lauchlan, 48, is a curly-haired Scot with a round, friendly face. He had originally started training as a surveyor in Glasgow, before applying to drama school. \"I gave up a good career for this,\" he quips. He got his break and moved south when he landed a couple of parts in the Play for Today series. In one of them his sidekick was a young Pierce Brosnan.</p> <p>\"I bet he's kicking himself now,\" kids Brenton.</p> <p>\"Yes, what's he done since?\" says Lauchlan, with a falsetto giggle that seems to belong to Dame Trot.</p> <p>The pair first met in the late 80s, when working as presenters on the BBC's Playdays. Presenting children's television was good, steady work, but the sector was seen as a graveyard for an actor with serious ambitions. There are unexpected compensations now - besides the success of Tweenies - because Lauchlan still gets bought drinks in pubs when he is recognised as the actor who did Fingermouse (an 80s remake of Fingerbobs), but in those days it was no joke.</p> <p>\"That feeling of it being second-rate entertainment was always there,\" says Lauchlan. \"It was a struggle. I loved doing presenting and financially it was rewarding, but to be taken seriously you really wanted to do the acting - the theatre and the telly.\"</p> <p>Brenton ensured that he diversified: appearing in Blood Brothers in the West End while presenting Playdays. He learned to direct, and went on to direct episodes of Emmerdale Farm and Coronation Street. But children's TV was, it seems, their destiny. The duo had made a successful video, Fun Song Factory, under the aegis of Tell-Tale, but both agree that the crucial event in their careers was external: in a word, Teletubbies.</p> <p>The Teletubbies phenomenon meant that, for the first time, the Beeb had serious money to invest in a children's series: the Tweenies' first run of 260 episodes was fully funded to the tune of \u00a37.4m. But Tell-Tale had to pitch against more than a dozen others to win the commission.</p> <p>The vital ingredient in their programme-making philosophy was that children are not \"some weird alien breed\" but have essentially the same tastes and interests as grown-ups, so their television should be modelled on adult drama: character-based and story-led.</p> <p>\"We looked around and saw kids' programmes with green dinosaurs and purple dragons and thought, 'We don't want to do that,' \" Brenton recalls. \"Instead we asked what we watched as adults, and it is soaps and sitcoms - so why don't we do a programme where we give pre-school children their peers on screen?</p> <p>\"That was the entire basis: four kids in a room - it was the shortest TV proposal ever.\"</p> <p>\"It was actually five kids,\" interjects Lauchlan.</p> <p>\"That's right,\" concedes Brenton. \"There was one who didn't quite make the cut. He was called Sid.\"</p> <p>Poor old Sid.</p> <p>\"That's showbusiness.\"</p> <p>It certainly is. Tell-Tale's publicist will not be drawn on the nature of its deal with the BBC, other than to say that it \"enjoys a healthy percentage split of all profits and ancillary activity\". One of Tell-Tale's four partners (Brenton and Lauchlan being the creative team), managing director Karl Woolley, is happy to concede that they are all \"well on the way to becoming millionaires\". Of course, when you look at the numbers, it's a no-brainer.</p> <p>\"A lot of people are becoming very wealthy off kids' TV. There's no doubt about it,\" confesses Brenton. \"But that doesn't mean kids' TV is therefore all bad. That's one of the battles we constantly have: 'We do Tweenies.' 'Oh, yeah: you're making a fortune.' 'Well, no, we think we make a very good programme.'\"</p> <p>Brenton and Lauchlan are keen to emphasise that the Tweenies had to fulfil a tight brief from the BBC, including educational content.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Sir Peter Hall has just celebrated his 70th birthday with a party. He says it was a wonderful night - his friends and colleagues, three out of the four wives, all there to raise a glass to his achievements.</p> <p>And what achievements - he founded the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1960 and ran the National Theatre for 15 years. Establishment man, radical sore, Thatcher voter, champion of subsidised theatre, he has been all things to all theatre types.</p> <p>And he shows no sign of slowing down. He has recently directed an avant-garde anal sex extravangaza at the Gate in London, prepared a Simon Gray play for its forthcoming premiere and hogged the strangest of headlines with his Shadow Arts Council. Now he is preparing to bring his Trojan war epic, Tantalus, nine plays for the price of one, to Britain.</p> <p>This is where we hit sticky ground. Tantalus is not entirely his. It was written, over a period of 17 years, by John Barton, one of Hall's oldest friends and collaborators. But Barton wasn't at the party, nor was he at the world premiere of Tantalus in Denver, Colorado. Barton and Hall are no longer talking.</p> <p>Sir Peter tucks himself into the table at a swanky London hotel. We are breakfasting. Hall is that kind of man - a busy beast. He looks like Orson Welles playing Falstaff.</p> <p>In the 60s, Hall was such a dapper man. There is a famous picture of him straddling his stool \u00e0 la Christine Keeler, striped socks, striped top, drainpipes, foppish shoes. He smiles into the camera, cigar in one hand, ashtray in the other. All soft leather and self-love. If there was a speech bubble it might read: \"Hey guys, what would you give to be me?\" Even today, the septuagenarian Goth looks as if he fancies himself. I ask him about Tantalus, and he says it's a long story. \"I've known John for 50 years. It's not been a very happy experience for me because we've worked together a great deal.\"</p> <p>In short, after Hall and Barton could not find a British backer, they came across a Denver benefactor with millions to spare. Hall wanted to cut Tantalus from 15 hours to 10. Barton says he agreed to trim but threw a wobbly when he discovered it was being slashed by Hall behind his back. He walked out on the director and the epic vision that has defined so much of his life, disowned it.</p> <p>\"He sees it as my adaptation, which it is,\" Hall says. \"He said 'I'll cut anything as you well know, it's just that my stuff doesn't need cutting'.\" Halls smiles. \"No, I'm being slightly naughty, but that was the subtext.\" Hall is supremely urbane, talks gently, compassionately, with daggers on his tongue.</p> <p>The play was wonderfully reviewed. Poor old John, I say, moping at home, while Hall basks in the glory. He jumps in before the words are out. \"What about poor old Peter? My whole life has been dedicated to trying to serve the dramatist, and I went into Tantalus in order to have another collaboration.\"</p> <p>Doesn't he feel as if he's kidnapped Barton's baby? \" Yesssss ... of course I do. That's at my worst moment. But I don't believe I have. I think I've put on the stage what he was writing about. I think I've put the strength and the quality of it on the stage. No, I'm deeply sorry that he's not happy, but there you are.\"</p> <p>It seems like a clash between two monstrous egos. Who has the bigger one? \"That's a very difficult question to answer. I suspect I have,\" he answers, cutting up his bacon with infinite delicacy. But the thing is, he says, theatre is a collaboration, and Barton just wasn't willing to play the game.</p> <p>\"He has an extraordinary belief in his own strengths as a writer. I don't actually think it's healthy .\" Hall speaks a clever, coded language, like a Soviet commissar. The suggestion seems to be that his old mate Barton is unstable, bonkers.</p> <p>He stresses to me that this is a one-off, that he has worked with all the greats and never had problems. \"I've had a wonderful relationship with Sam Beckett, Harold Pinter, Peter Shaffer, David Hare. The way I worked with Pinter is that he can say anything he likes about what I'm doing in the rehesarsal in front of the actors and I can say anything I like about the text, but on the text his word is final, and on the production my word is final should there be an absolute dispute. And I have to say, in 11 productions there never has been.\"</p> <p>But in the case of Tantalus, Barton's words weren't final? \"Absolutely, otherwise I wouldn't have done it.\"</p> <p>He says that when they went out to Colorado the play had no beginning or end, just a wonderful nut in the middle. And, ultimately, the fact that he has liberated the nut more than compensates for the negatives. \"It was worth it because it worked. The disadvantages were the risk, the pressure ... I was shit scared, really shit scared, because the stakes were enormous. I didn't want to be the person who entered the Guinness Book of Records for the longest flop of all time. And of course, one doesn't like losing a friend, a man one loves.\" He seems to have the knack of falling out with people. \"Such as who?\" he demands.</p> <p>I tell him I have made a list but am prepared to be corrected.</p> <p>\"Well, I doubt that.\"</p> <p>Funnily enough, the first name on the list is Pinter.</p> <p>\"I didn't fall out with Pinter. Harold Pinter fell out with me.\"</p> <p>I half expect him to stick his tongue out and go: nanananana. \"He thought my diaries treated him with insufficient tact, and he didn't speak to me for about five years. Then one morning I had a letter from him saying 'life's too short, come and have lunch'. And we're firm friends again ... Tell me of this long list.\"</p> <p>What about Bill Kenwright, the impresario who bankrolled Hall's attempt to bring high art to the West End? \"Oh, absolutely I fell out with Bill Kenwright. He asked me to do something which I found morally reprehensible .\"</p> <p>The V on Hall's forehead becomes more pronounced. It's not so much a receding hairline, as a receding head line. \"He asked me to walk out on a production in its last days. I thought it was very naughty ... Be careful with your lawyers, Bill is very litigious.\"</p> <p>As he has fallen out with people professionally, so he has privately. Few recent decades have not seen him trade in a wife for a newer model, from the actress Leslie Caron to his personal assistant Jacqueline Taylor, to the opera singer Maria Ewing, and finally to number four, Nicki Frei, to whom he has been happily married for 10 years.</p> <p>Hall's youngest daughter, eight-year-old Emma, recently asked why he has so many wives. He says he tried to explain to her the complexity of relationships; how for him if they are not all good, they tend to be all bad. \"I just tried to tell her what a healthy marriage was ... you have to be happy with each other and if you were unhappy it didn't do either of you any good, and it didn't do the children any good ... She has met all the other children, she has seen all the other wives and she likes all the other wives.\"</p> <p>He loves talking about the kids, being a father to young children for 43 years, how proud he is now that most have joined him in the profession, the funny little stories from a complicated domestic history. \"Recently Emma was chosen to sing in the choir. I said you have got, really, a nice voice, and she said, 'I've probably got it from Maria! Hehehehehe!\"</p> <p>I tell him I have a daughter of a similar age. He doesn't seem to hear. He tells me how proud he is of his son, Edward, who is directing three of the Tantalus plays. Edward was a bit of a rebel, decided not to go to Oxbridge, opted for somwhere real, like Leeds, before dropping out after two terms. Oh, I say, I went to Leeds. Hall doesn't seem to hear.

      "bodyText": "Sir Peter Hall has just celebrated his 70th birthday with a party. He says it was a wonderful night - his friends and colleagues, three out of the four wives, all there to raise a glass to his achievements. And what achievements - he founded the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1960 and ran the National Theatre for 15 years. Establishment man, radical sore, Thatcher voter, champion of subsidised theatre, he has been all things to all theatre types. And he shows no sign of slowing down. He has recently directed an avant-garde anal sex extravangaza at the Gate in London, prepared a Simon Gray play for its forthcoming premiere and hogged the strangest of headlines with his Shadow Arts Council. Now he is preparing to bring his Trojan war epic, Tantalus, nine plays for the price of one, to Britain. This is where we hit sticky ground. Tantalus is not entirely his. It was written, over a period of 17 years, by John Barton, one of Hall's oldest friends and collaborators. But Barton wasn't at the party, nor was he at the world premiere of Tantalus in Denver, Colorado. Barton and Hall are no longer talking. Sir Peter tucks himself into the table at a swanky London hotel. We are breakfasting. Hall is that kind of man - a busy beast. He looks like Orson Welles playing Falstaff. In the 60s, Hall was such a dapper man. There is a famous picture of him straddling his stool \u00e0 la Christine Keeler, striped socks, striped top, drainpipes, foppish shoes. He smiles into the camera, cigar in one hand, ashtray in the other. All soft leather and self-love. If there was a speech bubble it might read: \"Hey guys, what would you give to be me?\" Even today, the septuagenarian Goth looks as if he fancies himself. I ask him about Tantalus, and he says it's a long story. \"I've known John for 50 years. It's not been a very happy experience for me because we've worked together a great deal.\" In short, after Hall and Barton could not find a British backer, they came across a Denver benefactor with millions to spare. Hall wanted to cut Tantalus from 15 hours to 10. Barton says he agreed to trim but threw a wobbly when he discovered it was being slashed by Hall behind his back. He walked out on the director and the epic vision that has defined so much of his life, disowned it. \"He sees it as my adaptation, which it is,\" Hall says. \"He said 'I'll cut anything as you well know, it's just that my stuff doesn't need cutting'.\" Halls smiles. \"No, I'm being slightly naughty, but that was the subtext.\" Hall is supremely urbane, talks gently, compassionately, with daggers on his tongue. The play was wonderfully reviewed. Poor old John, I say, moping at home, while Hall basks in the glory. He jumps in before the words are out. \"What about poor old Peter? My whole life has been dedicated to trying to serve the dramatist, and I went into Tantalus in order to have another collaboration.\" Doesn't he feel as if he's kidnapped Barton's baby? \" Yesssss ... of course I do. That's at my worst moment. But I don't believe I have. I think I've put on the stage what he was writing about. I think I've put the strength and the quality of it on the stage. No, I'm deeply sorry that he's not happy, but there you are.\" It seems like a clash between two monstrous egos. Who has the bigger one? \"That's a very difficult question to answer. I suspect I have,\" he answers, cutting up his bacon with infinite delicacy. But the thing is, he says, theatre is a collaboration, and Barton just wasn't willing to play the game. \"He has an extraordinary belief in his own strengths as a writer. I don't actually think it's healthy .\" Hall speaks a clever, coded language, like a Soviet commissar. The suggestion seems to be that his old mate Barton is unstable, bonkers. He stresses to me that this is a one-off, that he has worked with all the greats and never had problems. \"I've had a wonderful relationship with Sam Beckett, Harold Pinter, Peter Shaffer, David Hare. The way I worked with Pinter is that he can say anything he likes about what I'm doing in the rehesarsal in front of the actors and I can say anything I like about the text, but on the text his word is final, and on the production my word is final should there be an absolute dispute. And I have to say, in 11 productions there never has been.\" But in the case of Tantalus, Barton's words weren't final? \"Absolutely, otherwise I wouldn't have done it.\" He says that when they went out to Colorado the play had no beginning or end, just a wonderful nut in the middle. And, ultimately, the fact that he has liberated the nut more than compensates for the negatives. \"It was worth it because it worked. The disadvantages were the risk, the pressure ... I was shit scared, really shit scared, because the stakes were enormous. I didn't want to be the person who entered the Guinness Book of Records for the longest flop of all time. And of course, one doesn't like losing a friend, a man one loves.\" He seems to have the knack of falling out with people. \"Such as who?\" he demands. I tell him I have made a list but am prepared to be corrected. \"Well, I doubt that.\" Funnily enough, the first name on the list is Pinter. \"I didn't fall out with Pinter. Harold Pinter fell out with me.\" I half expect him to stick his tongue out and go: nanananana. \"He thought my diaries treated him with insufficient tact, and he didn't speak to me for about five years. Then one morning I had a letter from him saying 'life's too short, come and have lunch'. And we're firm friends again ... Tell me of this long list.\" What about Bill Kenwright, the impresario who bankrolled Hall's attempt to bring high art to the West End? \"Oh, absolutely I fell out with Bill Kenwright. He asked me to do something which I found morally reprehensible .\" The V on Hall's forehead becomes more pronounced. It's not so much a receding hairline, as a receding head line. \"He asked me to walk out on a production in its last days. I thought it was very naughty ... Be careful with your lawyers, Bill is very litigious.\" As he has fallen out with people professionally, so he has privately. Few recent decades have not seen him trade in a wife for a newer model, from the actress Leslie Caron to his personal assistant Jacqueline Taylor, to the opera singer Maria Ewing, and finally to number four, Nicki Frei, to whom he has been happily married for 10 years. Hall's youngest daughter, eight-year-old Emma, recently asked why he has so many wives. He says he tried to explain to her the complexity of relationships; how for him if they are not all good, they tend to be all bad. \"I just tried to tell her what a healthy marriage was ... you have to be happy with each other and if you were unhappy it didn't do either of you any good, and it didn't do the children any good ... She has met all the other children, she has seen all the other wives and she likes all the other wives.\" He loves talking about the kids, being a father to young children for 43 years, how proud he is now that most have joined him in the profession, the funny little stories from a complicated domestic history. \"Recently Emma was chosen to sing in the choir. I said you have got, really, a nice voice, and she said, 'I've probably got it from Maria! Hehehehehe!\" I tell him I have a daughter of a similar age. He doesn't seem to hear. He tells me how proud he is of his son, Edward, who is directing three of the Tantalus plays. Edward was a bit of a rebel, decided not to go to Oxbridge, opted for somwhere real, like Leeds, before dropping out after two terms. Oh, I say, I went to Leeds. Hall doesn't seem to hear. He tells me how, finally, he is once again close to the wives, how he has loved them all, in different ways. Hall once said that making love to a woman is the closest most men will get to being an artist. He nods in recognition. Does he regard himself as a bedroom artist? \"That's a really good question that is, isn't it? Hehehehe! If you say yes ... hehehe! Ah, yes that's a clever one. I think the words I would apply to the creative arts - integrity, vision, tenderness, warmth, compassion, surprise, shock, perhaps even violence - can all apply to that area.\" For a second, he verges on the coy. He nips modestly at his sausage. So is he a good lover? \"I've not ever been worried in that area.\" Ah, that's more like it. Anyway, back to more important matters - he wants more names on the list. Well there is Mick Gordon, the director who also walked out of Tantalus. Hall puts on his best bereaved face. \"Mick Gordon's a very, very talented young guy. He did extraordinary work on Tantalus, a lot of research work.\" The more he praises, the more I wait for the dagger. \"He appeared to be tremendously happy. There wasn't any dispute.\" He explains how Gordon returned to Britain for a weekend, said 'see you Monday', and that was the last they saw of him. \"On Monday a fax arrived from him saying he wasn't coming back, he wasn't happy.\" And Gordon had never told him before? \"On my father's grave, not a word. At the time he had three plays under his total control. After about eight weeks, I had a letter from him saying one day he'd like to explain.

He says he doesn't fall out with people, he is just honest, tells things as they are. What about the Shadow Arts Council debacle? Last year he set up the body to oppose the government's approach to funding. The only problem was that most of the luminaries named on the executive hadn't heard of it. The likes of Tom Stoppard, Harrison Birtwistle and Richard Eyre were all said to be incensed at being unilaterally appointed by Hall. He had been a bit premature hadn't he? \" I hadn't. Someone else had. They sent out the letters and it was a bit of a cock up, and the department spun themselves to death.\" He says that, actually, the Shadow Arts Council has been fantastically successful, has really made the department of culture sit up and take notice. So all those who railed against their inclusion are now back on the council? \"Tom is. I can't remember if Harrison's back on. It was a load of rubbish, all that. They were both at my party on Sunday.\" Sir Peter is rushing for a train. He puts on his black coat and black cap and scurries off, legs going all ways, like a hyperactive beetle. The following day his press officer rings up. She has been having a chat with Sir Peter and he thought it might be helpful for me to see the guest list for his 70th birthday do. A few minutes later, an email arrives. \"Simon, this is the list as promised. It was a wonderfully warm, affectionate evening with old friends and family.

Lloyds TSB, which bought Scottish Widows earlier this year, is understood to be anxious to avoid a hostile bid for Abbey, which it is thought to have approached about a friendly merger a year ago. Industry sources believe that Peter Ellwood, the chief executive of Lloyds TSB, is keen to wade into the battle for control of Abbey; he is said to want to use the opportunity to prove his management credentials.

Today's flotation comes 20 months after B&amp;B members voted 62% to 38% in favour of a conversion resolution put forward by Stephen Major, a plumber from Northern Ireland. He had claimed that members could receive windfalls of \u00a32,000 each. The society - which had been targeted by hundreds of thousands of carpetbaggers in the run-up to the vote - acceded to members' wishes, later provoking anger by deciding to award all members 250 shares each, regardless of how much they had tied up with it. Goldman Sachs's estimate of the value of the shares is be tween 259p and 326p, which would give windfalls of between \u00a3647 and \u00a3815. But most analysts believe the shares will debut at the bottom end of this range, or perhaps even lower. Stockbroker Teather &amp; Greenwood has said it expected the shares to trade at 240p, which would mean windfalls worth \u00a3600. It added that Bradford &amp; Bingley would be in the FTSE 250 index, with Northern Rock, but had no chance of entering the FTSE 100. Just over 1m people - 38.5% of the membership - elected to sell their shares immediately. Bradford &amp; Bingley is due to put out a statement this morning announcing the price achieved at Friday's auction of unwanted shares aimed at institutional investors. Cheques for the proceeds, less a \u00a310 selling fee, will be dispatched to these people on December 11. Bradford &amp; Bingley said that provided these were paid in to a B&amp;B account, they would be treated as cash, and people would not have to wait for the cheques to clear. All those members who elected to keep their shares should have received their \"welcome packs\", including a nominee statement confirming their shareholding, by today. The packs include a form which members must send back if they want to receive a share certificate. Those who opt to keep their shares in the Bradford &amp; Bingley nominee account can sell them, or buy more, using a post-only share dealing facility.",

      "body": "<p>Just over two years ago, in what now seems a much more ambitious era for European federalists, the German finance minister, Oskar Lafontaine, gave a briefing in the margins of a meeting of EU finance ministers that there was a strong case for tax harmonisation across the EU. Coordination was necessary for the protection of the single market, the new euro currency and the free movement of labour, he said.</p> <p>At the same time, the European commission was pushing for a common withholding tax to prevent individuals who held savings abroad from evading tax.</p> <p>Transmuted through the British Eurosceptics, these ideas raised the spectre of the EU setting British income tax rates, even though the EU treaty gives the commission no power to interfere in direct taxes. Mr Lafontaine was dubbed the most dangerous man in Europe.</p> <p>Since then the climate has changed. Mr Lafontaine has quit the German government and the EU's version of a withholding tax has been driven from the field by the chancellor, Gordon Brown</p> <p>But new proposals on tax, and social security, are to be brought to this week's EU summit in Nice with the support of the commission and the French presidency. They insist the plans are altogether more modest, and technical, than anything proposed by Mr Lafontaine.</p> <p>Yet Britain, along with Ireland and Luxembourg, has served notice it will refuse to give ground on tax and social security, even if it means deadlock in the marathon talks.</p> <p>Treasury officials say that at one level the issues are straightforward. \"We will not cede any loss of the national veto over tax or social security. It is as simple as that,\" a spokesman said.</p> <p>It is the reddest of Britain's so-called red lines in the talks. In reality, the truth is more complex. Significant ground on tax has already been ceded by all countries in the interests of a single competitive market. In 1991, the EU agreed to adopt, with many exemptions, a minimum standard rate of VAT of 15% and minimum rates of excise duty on mineral oils, alcohol and tobacco. This mandate was also used to abolish customs duty within the free trade area.</p> <p>Similarly, the EU has already used its powers under single market laws to try to remove harmful tax competition. An EU code of conduct group, chaired by the Treasury minister, Dawn Primarolo, is to identify tax measures that \"unduly affect\" where companies place their businesses.</p> <p>Now the commission is coming forward with its next phase of proposals the removal of the national veto in specific tax and social security fields.</p> <p>The EU president, Romano Prodi, is presenting them as largely technical. He said recently: \"I have proposed safeguards to ensure that majority voting cannot apply to sensitive decisions such as harmonisation of tax rates. Yet we urgently need to modernise our tax systems so they can keep pace with the revolution in electronic commerce. The unanimity rule makes this difficult.</p> <p>\"More generally we need to rationalise taxation for the benefit of business without changing the rates of and structures of tax systems. It is absurd that a company based in one EU country should have to wait three years to recover VAT from the authorities of another.\"</p> <p>Chris Patten, the EU commissioner, also indicated yesterday that there are serious arguments in favour of more majority voting on tax, especially fraud, to make the single market more effective.</p> <p>To ease British anxieties, the commission has tried to restrict its proposals in specific treaty language. Under article 93 the national veto would be removed so that \"in the area of indirect taxation\" the EU can \"adopt technical updating measures to simplify existing community rules, or to ensure uniform application of existing rules relating to turnover, tax excise duties and other forms of indirect taxation\".</p> <p>In relation to turnover tax, such as stamp duty, this would apply to setting EU wide rules in relation to \"refund arrange ments, the determination of the person liable for payment of the tax, fiscal procedures, the definition of concepts in common\". Majority voting would also apply if a country sought a derogation from these rules.</p> <p>In deference to the British, the new article 93, to be negotiated at Nice, would explicitly state it could not apply to rules concerning the location of transactions, the reallocation of tax revenue between member states and the fixing of rates. In relation to excise duties, majority voting would apply to their structure, but not their rates.</p> <p>The commission also wants powers to introduce majority voting in the introduction of \"measures for the sole purpose of preventing fraud, tax evasion and the circumvention of existing rules\".</p> <p>Senior British negotiators are adamant they will not accept these proposals.</p> <p>One said: \"If you have majority voting in any of these areas, we would have had majority voting imposing on Britain the withholding tax - which is designed to prevent fraud - in its original unworkable form.\"</p> <p>Britain is fighting a more lonely battle over article 42 to to stop majority voting on the harmonisation of social security. Since much British social security is paid through tax credits, Britain fears concessions in this area could give the commission back door access to our tax system.</p> <p>However, the commission says it wants majority voting in a limited sphere - how EU member states, when assessing someone's entitlement to benefit, take into account completed periods of residence, employment or insurance, even if the periods were completed in another EU country.

      "bodyText": "Just over two years ago, in what now seems a much more ambitious era for European federalists, the German finance minister, Oskar Lafontaine, gave a briefing in the margins of a meeting of EU finance ministers that there was a strong case for tax harmonisation across the EU. Coordination was necessary for the protection of the single market, the new euro currency and the free movement of labour, he said. At the same time, the European commission was pushing for a common withholding tax to prevent individuals who held savings abroad from evading tax. Transmuted through the British Eurosceptics, these ideas raised the spectre of the EU setting British income tax rates, even though the EU treaty gives the commission no power to interfere in direct taxes. Mr Lafontaine was dubbed the most dangerous man in Europe. Since then the climate has changed. Mr Lafontaine has quit the German government and the EU's version of a withholding tax has been driven from the field by the chancellor, Gordon Brown But new proposals on tax, and social security, are to be brought to this week's EU summit in Nice with the support of the commission and the French presidency. They insist the plans are altogether more modest, and technical, than anything proposed by Mr Lafontaine. Yet Britain, along with Ireland and Luxembourg, has served notice it will refuse to give ground on tax and social security, even if it means deadlock in the marathon talks. Treasury officials say that at one level the issues are straightforward. \"We will not cede any loss of the national veto over tax or social security. It is as simple as that,\" a spokesman said. It is the reddest of Britain's so-called red lines in the talks. In reality, the truth is more complex. Significant ground on tax has already been ceded by all countries in the interests of a single competitive market. In 1991, the EU agreed to adopt, with many exemptions, a minimum standard rate of VAT of 15% and minimum rates of excise duty on mineral oils, alcohol and tobacco. This mandate was also used to abolish customs duty within the free trade area. Similarly, the EU has already used its powers under single market laws to try to remove harmful tax competition. An EU code of conduct group, chaired by the Treasury minister, Dawn Primarolo, is to identify tax measures that \"unduly affect\" where companies place their businesses. Now the commission is coming forward with its next phase of proposals the removal of the national veto in specific tax and social security fields. The EU president, Romano Prodi, is presenting them as largely technical. He said recently: \"I have proposed safeguards to ensure that majority voting cannot apply to sensitive decisions such as harmonisation of tax rates. Yet we urgently need to modernise our tax systems so they can keep pace with the revolution in electronic commerce. The unanimity rule makes this difficult. \"More generally we need to rationalise taxation for the benefit of business without changing the rates of and structures of tax systems. It is absurd that a company based in one EU country should have to wait three years to recover VAT from the authorities of another.\" Chris Patten, the EU commissioner, also indicated yesterday that there are serious arguments in favour of more majority voting on tax, especially fraud, to make the single market more effective. To ease British anxieties, the commission has tried to restrict its proposals in specific treaty language. Under article 93 the national veto would be removed so that \"in the area of indirect taxation\" the EU can \"adopt technical updating measures to simplify existing community rules, or to ensure uniform application of existing rules relating to turnover, tax excise duties and other forms of indirect taxation\". In relation to turnover tax, such as stamp duty, this would apply to setting EU wide rules in relation to \"refund arrange ments, the determination of the person liable for payment of the tax, fiscal procedures, the definition of concepts in common\". Majority voting would also apply if a country sought a derogation from these rules. In deference to the British, the new article 93, to be negotiated at Nice, would explicitly state it could not apply to rules concerning the location of transactions, the reallocation of tax revenue between member states and the fixing of rates. In relation to excise duties, majority voting would apply to their structure, but not their rates. The commission also wants powers to introduce majority voting in the introduction of \"measures for the sole purpose of preventing fraud, tax evasion and the circumvention of existing rules\". Senior British negotiators are adamant they will not accept these proposals. One said: \"If you have majority voting in any of these areas, we would have had majority voting imposing on Britain the withholding tax - which is designed to prevent fraud - in its original unworkable form.\" Britain is fighting a more lonely battle over article 42 to to stop majority voting on the harmonisation of social security. Since much British social security is paid through tax credits, Britain fears concessions in this area could give the commission back door access to our tax system. However, the commission says it wants majority voting in a limited sphere - how EU member states, when assessing someone's entitlement to benefit, take into account completed periods of residence, employment or insurance, even if the periods were completed in another EU country. In theory, an EU citizen could have all his pension entitlements, from different periods of residence in different countries, gathered together and paid in one country. Britain dismisses this idea as bureaucratic and unworkable. \"Harmonising the accounting of all medical costs at the point of delivery, one commission idea, is inapplicable here since the NHS is free at the point of delivery, unlike in Europe\", a British official said.

A Treatise on Human Nature by David Hume</strong><br>If I had to choose just one philosophical book, this would be it. It covers a huge range of continuing philosophical topics: knowledge, perception, imagination, personal identity, causation, emotions, the foundations of morality and justice. Hume is the most endearing of all philosophers as well as the most sceptical. His scepticism covers even his own conclusions but his thoroughly 18th-century down-to-earth good sense permits him to persevere. I would dearly love to have met him.</p> <p><strong>2. The Nicomachean Ethics by Aristotle</strong><br>Aristotle's philosophical interests were extraordinarily wide. He was more of a biological scientist than a metaphysician; everything he wrote is worth study, especially as part of the history of science. The Nicomachean Ethics is not only historically fascinating, but it timelessly points the way to the development of a theory of ethics out of the concept of human beings as essentially rational, choice-making animals. I have learned more from this book than any other.</p> <p><strong>3. Individuals by PF Strawson</strong><br>Published in 1959, this was a ground-breaking book of enormous importance to philosophers of my generation. After the second world war, we were not much into metaphysics. But this was a new descriptive metaphysics (to use Strawson's own phrase), not windbag speculation, but drawing general conclusions from how things are. It opened the way of a solution to the problem of personal identity and the relation between mind and body by insisting that persons, being both mental and physical entities, were among the basic particulars in the world, not to be atomised or further divided up.</p> <p><strong>4. The Bounds of Sense by PF Strawson</strong><br>Sub-titled 'An Essay on Kant's Critique of Pure Reason', this is an illuminating analysis of Kant's main line of thought in the Critique, and it goes beyond Kant in its marvellously perceptive discussion of the relation between language and the world as we perceive it. Kant was perhaps the first truly professional philosopher. He had an immense influence on all subsequent philosophy but he was also a difficult and rebarbative writer. Strawson's book is not a simplification, but a demonstration of the profundity and significance of Kant's whole philosophical project, that of setting limits to what we can and cannot say and know. An indispensable guide.</p> <p><strong>5. On Liberty by John Stuart Mill</strong><br>Unlike Mill's other generally sensible and analytic books (on logic, political theory and utilitarian ethics) this is a passionate cry for the freedom of the individual from the tyranny of the majority, from prejudice, social convention and the bondage of correctness - what might today be thought of as the Daily Mail rule. It is a wrong-headed book in many ways but is irresistible to the young. Moreover it can plausibly be read as one of the most powerful feminist tracts, having been strongly influenced, if not actually partly written, by Mill's lover and later wife Harriet Taylor.

      "bodyText": "Lady Mary Warnock is a crossbench life peer, moral philosopher and author of a number of books on philosophy, including The Intelligent Person's Guide to Ethics. Her autobiography, Mary Warnock: a memoir, was published earlier this year by Gerald Duckworth. Buy Mary Warnock: A Memoir at Amazon.co.uk Buy The Intelligent Person's Guide to Ethics at Amazon.co.uk 1. A Treatise on Human Nature by David Hume If I had to choose just one philosophical book, this would be it. It covers a huge range of continuing philosophical topics: knowledge, perception, imagination, personal identity, causation, emotions, the foundations of morality and justice. Hume is the most endearing of all philosophers as well as the most sceptical. His scepticism covers even his own conclusions but his thoroughly 18th-century down-to-earth good sense permits him to persevere. I would dearly love to have met him. 2. The Nicomachean Ethics by Aristotle Aristotle's philosophical interests were extraordinarily wide. He was more of a biological scientist than a metaphysician; everything he wrote is worth study, especially as part of the history of science. The Nicomachean Ethics is not only historically fascinating, but it timelessly points the way to the development of a theory of ethics out of the concept of human beings as essentially rational, choice-making animals. I have learned more from this book than any other. 3. Individuals by PF Strawson Published in 1959, this was a ground-breaking book of enormous importance to philosophers of my generation. After the second world war, we were not much into metaphysics. But this was a new descriptive metaphysics (to use Strawson's own phrase), not windbag speculation, but drawing general conclusions from how things are. It opened the way of a solution to the problem of personal identity and the relation between mind and body by insisting that persons, being both mental and physical entities, were among the basic particulars in the world, not to be atomised or further divided up. 4. The Bounds of Sense by PF Strawson Sub-titled 'An Essay on Kant's Critique of Pure Reason', this is an illuminating analysis of Kant's main line of thought in the Critique, and it goes beyond Kant in its marvellously perceptive discussion of the relation between language and the world as we perceive it. Kant was perhaps the first truly professional philosopher. He had an immense influence on all subsequent philosophy but he was also a difficult and rebarbative writer. Strawson's book is not a simplification, but a demonstration of the profundity and significance of Kant's whole philosophical project, that of setting limits to what we can and cannot say and know. An indispensable guide. 5. On Liberty by John Stuart Mill Unlike Mill's other generally sensible and analytic books (on logic, political theory and utilitarian ethics) this is a passionate cry for the freedom of the individual from the tyranny of the majority, from prejudice, social convention and the bondage of correctness - what might today be thought of as the Daily Mail rule. It is a wrong-headed book in many ways but is irresistible to the young. Moreover it can plausibly be read as one of the most powerful feminist tracts, having been strongly influenced, if not actually partly written, by Mill's lover and later wife Harriet Taylor. At a time of general emancipation women alone were virtual slaves in 1859, when the book was published. 6. Beast and Man by Mary Midgley A wonderful breath of fresh air and a book for non-philosophers as much as for philosophers. Mary Midgley explores the relation between men and other animals in an original but common sense way which has even more relevance to bioethical controversies today than it had in 1978 when it was published. It forms an introduction to the kind of 'green' philosophy now developing in Europe and America, and it has certainly strongly influenced my own thought, both practical and philosophical. 7. After Virtue by Alisdair McIntyre An entirely new look at moral philosophy, which is nevertheless, as McIntyre acknowledges, highly Aristotelian. He is a truly original philosopher and all his books are worth reading but this is probably his best. It is of the greatest importance to provide a basis for morality in what is largely a secular age, and the question of what morality is needs a fresh look. This book was one of the first to attempt such a new perception. 8. Sense and Sensibilia by JL Austin Though in fact a collection of lectures published posthumously, this forms a wholly coherent book, and is the funniest philosophical book in existence (with the possible exception of Susan Stebbing's Philosophy and the Physicists) Largely negative and destructive, it calls attention to the impossible things philosophers may be led to assert, and even claim to believe. The main target is AJ Ayer, and, to a lesser extent, Ayer's hero, Bertrand Russell, and their theory of perception.

The government wanted to hear from employers who would make a contribution to a \u00a3250m fund - kicked off with government cash - which would be targeted at essential workers. </p> <p>One idea floated has been for top-up mortgages of up to \u00a350,000 on homes at the lower end of the market costing \u00a3125,000 or less. Buyers would have to find a commercial lender to give a \u00a375,000 mortgage, with the government scheme topping this up with \u00a350,000 interest free. </p> <p>David Butler, chief executive of the Chartered Institute of Housing, which helped fund yesterday's report, warned: \"The housing market is failing a significant section of the population. </p> <p>\"Our country's continued prosperity depends on these issues being addressed by targeted intervention at a local level. </p> <p>Richard McCarthy, chief executive of the Peabody Trust, a large social landlord in London which also helped sponsor the research, warned that in London alone there was now a shortage of nearly 36,000 essential workers due mainly to the lack of affordable accommodation.</p>",

A new urgency has been added to the government's proposed starter homes initiative with a study by leading housing organisations today warning that England faces an acute shortage of accommodation because more people are living alone. The research, for the Our Homes, Our Future campaign, shows that in the past 30 years house prices have increased by 135 % and wages by only 60 %. It warns that special measures are needed to help the 2m people expected to be living alone by 2016 - most of them over 30. \"These people are at particular risk because many of them live in the south-east of England and are reliant on only one income to buy a home in a market already unaffordable to many,\" it said. The report, by the Cambridge Centre of Housing, Planning and Research, also warned that key workers in areas of high demand are at risk because their nationally-negotiated wage rates do not adequately reflect higher than average house prices. With leading housing organisations warning that \"targeted\" help is now needed, ministers are poised to promise interest-free top-up loans, cash for deposits and help with shared ownership schemes under which a publicly-funded housing association might own half the equity of a home. The housing minister, Nick Raynsford, has said there is scope for \"innovative new thinking\" in this area. The government wanted to hear from employers who would make a contribution to a \u00a3250m fund - kicked off with government cash - which would be targeted at essential workers. One idea floated has been for top-up mortgages of up to \u00a350,000 on homes at the lower end of the market costing \u00a3125,000 or less. Buyers would have to find a commercial lender to give a \u00a375,000 mortgage, with the government scheme topping this up with \u00a350,000 interest free. David Butler, chief executive of the Chartered Institute of Housing, which helped fund yesterday's report, warned: \"The housing market is failing a significant section of the population. \"Our country's continued prosperity depends on these issues being addressed by targeted intervention at a local level. Richard McCarthy, chief executive of the Peabody Trust, a large social landlord in London which also helped sponsor the research, warned that in London alone there was now a shortage of nearly 36,000 essential workers due mainly to the lack of affordable accommodation.",

None of the five ballets are specifically about England but all, in some way, are fed by the temperamental compromise which seems to make English art tick: the national habits of feeling which temper grandeur with irony and limit romanticism with domestic detail. </p> <p>The centrepiece of the evening is a revival of Antony Tudor's rarely staged Lilac Garden (1936), the work in which Tudor, a former butcher's clerk, staked his claim to become the English Proust of the ballet world. It's a tragedy of social manners in which a woman, Caroline, arrives at a party to celebrate her impending marriage to a man she doesn't love. There she meets not only her real lover but also the discarded mistress of her husband-to-be. </p> <p>Tudor's vocabulary of simple, resonant gestures handles the situation with fraught but never melodramatic emotion. In Caroline's hysterical attempts to maintain her self-control, and in her fianc\u00e9's quietly brutal command over her body, we see a relationship of clenched powerplay. Caroline's brief encounters with her lover are a febrile clash of nerves and passion while the discarded mistress threatens all decorum in her attempts to claw back her former lover. These unhappy protagonists slip between crisis and shadow while their various friends, bright, brittle and knowing, persistently try to draw them back into the social dance. </p> <p>Sylvie Guillem as Caroline is mesmerising, with her body wired to the tightest possible pitch and oscillating agonisingly between revulsion and desire. Christopher Saunders' fianc\u00e9 is a man of terrifyingly stiff propriety, destined to be a bully in the drawing room and a shit in bed. It's a measure of Tudor's emotional intelligence that, with the right dancers, this period ballet feels as psychologically loaded as any modern work, and Saturday's fine cast should guarantee its future in the Royal's rep. </p> <p>The other works in the programme were more familiar, but performed by dancers who made us see the choreography, and sometimes themselves, with new perspectives. In Ashton's glamorously apocalyptic La Valse, we saw Zenaida Yanowksy's long austere body turn almost baroque in its lavish musical response, while Darcey Bussell brought amplitude and magnificence to Monotones II: her high attitude line hovering in the air like a beautiful bird of prey. MacMillan's war requiem, Gloria, had Leanne Benjamin dancing an exquisite angel of death, with Jonathan Cope as the iconic unknown soldier giving the uncanny impression of a body both supercharged with power and refined into ghostly weightlessness. </p> <p>Finally Ashton's transparent pastoral Symphonic Variations, had a rare cast to do it justice: with limpid, delicate dancing from both Miyako Yoshida and Belinda Hatley, and graceful rectitude from Johann Kobborg and Inaki Urlezaga. </p> <p>\u0095 Until December 20.
