      "body": "<p>In the beginning was the book. It came to her in 1983, when she was 24 not long out of Oxford but already disenchanted with London. Desperate not to follow her old classmates into banking or advertising or indeed any job that came with routine hours, she was considering a move to the country when suddenly she found herself writing. 'It was not an accident, or an experiment, or a whim,' she later recalled, 'it was a downstream force by a high wind. It was as though the book was already written, such was the speed and certainty of its being. How had this thing overtaken me? I realised that I was not going to start a smallholding.' </p> <p>The heroine of this book is a girl named Jeanette whose story bears a close resemblance her creator's. Born near Manchester, adopted by Pentecostalists as an infant and raised to become a missionary, the fictitious Jeanette is ejected from her church in her teens after her adoptive mother denounces her publicly for a lesbian affair. But as in life, it turns out to be a blessing in disguise. </p> <p>When it was done, the real Jeanette looked at her work and was very, very pleased. It was, she later wrote, quite unlike any book ever written. Not only was it deeply threatening to the status quo: it was also a deeply comforting narrative with universal appeal. What's more, it was technically brilliant, partly because it was shaped like a spiral. This, she felt, gave it a fluidity that allowed 'infinite movement'. </p> <p>Having packed all that into a mere 170 or so pages, she took Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit , for that was its name, to Phillippa Brewster at Pandora. Catching this editor's eye was not too difficult as Jeanette happened to be working in her office at the time. It was love at first sight for Phillippa, but she had to fight like hell to convince her bosses that the book had potential. In the end she could only get them to do it in paperback. When it went on to win the 1985 Whitbread Prize for best first novel, no one was less surprised than the author. </p> <p>There followed a brief literary honeymoon. Everyone was calling her a breath of fresh air. In describing her style, they used the same words she did: scintillating, fluid, radiant, humming, daring, formidable, brilliant, biblical, head and shoulders above her contemporaries. The only spoilsports at this point were a handful of her peers from St Catherine's College, Oxford. They spoke darkly of megalomania and hubris: this woman did not just act like God, they said, she actually thought she was God. But most of these naysayers were just starting out in publishing, they didn't have much clout, and no one listened to them. </p> <p>By now Jeanette had an agent who loved her dearly, and through this agent she had met Ruth and Don Rendell, who were so taken with her that they offered Jeanette their garden shed as a study. She also had a new editor, Liz Calder at Bloomsbury, and a new novel called The Passion that everyone at Bloomsbury was just over the moon about. They loved the next novel, Sexing the Cherry, even more. So did the critics. But it was a pity, more people began to say, about the author. </p> <p>My first brush with her was at a reading at the ICA. It was the first event on a national publicity tour with two other women authors. At the ICA they had equal billing, but at the last minute Jeanette announced that she was having none of that. She took over as chair, which turned out to be an even more laughable figure of speech than usual. Not once did she sit down. Instead she stood at the front of the stage, pontificating away, and only occasionally looking down at her stage companions to invite them to speak. </p> <p>The publishers had organised a dinner. Jeanette, I was later told, declined to attend. She also declined to travel by train with the other authors during their national tour. Instead she insisted on, and apparently got, her own chauffeur-driven car. </p> <p>The refrain among gossips now became: 'Who does she think she is?' We soon found out. Her first truly outrageous public act was on a special film the Late Show did in connection with her fourth novel, Written on the Body. The film ended with a sequence of Jeanette tramping across a park looking intensely into the camera while sporting her famous impish grin, and reminding us of the passage in A Room of One's Own in which Virginia Woolf expresses the hope that one day, perhaps 50 years on, there would be a woman writing in English whose gifts were equal to Shakespeare's. She then went on to announce that she was that woman. </p> <p>She went on to tell a tabloid interviewer that the novel (about an unnamed, sexually ambiguous narrator's affair with a married woman) was based on her own stormy lesbian affair with her agent. Who was no longer her agent. She didn't need an agent, she said, as she now had a coven (her term for the tight network of close female friends who help run her household) and a wife. If Peggy Reynolds, the distinguished academic and broadcaster, took issue with Jeanette for talking about her like this, she did not let on. </p> <p>Unchecked, Jeanette went on to fly even closer to the sun. Not only did she name her own novel as Book of the Year: in 1995, when she was asked to name her favourite living author, she chose herself. 'No one working in the English language now comes close to my exuberance, my passion, and my fidelity to words.' </p> <p>But the tide was turning. Reviews for Written on the Body were mixed. Art and Lies got a mostly negative reception. The cut that seems to have hurt the most came from Nicci Gerrard, a longtime friend and admirer who had published Jeanette in the mid-Eighties when she was an editor at Women's Review. </p> <p>In a painstakingly balanced profile she did for The Observer, Nicci said that she thought Jeanette had gone off the boil, and suggested that this could be because she was cutting herself off from the outside world and surrounding herself with yes-women. Late one night not long after this profile was published, Jeanette and Peggy fitted themselves out in their biker leathers (so the story goes) and went out to settle scores. </p> <p>But their timing could not have been worse. It was only after they had barged into Nicci Gerrard's north London home that they saw there was a dinner party in full swing. They would not have known, but they ought to have guessed, that almost all the people round the table would be journalists. And who could blame those journalists for telling everyone they ran into what happened when they went back to their offices? </p> <p>The backlash was vicious and went on for years. Although no one could say that she didn't ask for it, there was still something ugly about the way the press boys went after her, ridiculing her not just for her bad behaviour and her mad claims, but also for being a lesbian, living an unusual life, daring to take herself as seriously in public as, let's be honest, almost all novelists do when hiding in the safety of their own closets. </p> <p>The difference between Jeanette Winterson and most of her contemporaries is that she doesn't know where to stop. She doesn't know because she didn't grow up in a nice middle-class please-and-thank-you sort of family. In spite of the fun she's made of the weird evangelists who had brought her up, she's still very much their daughter, and she's embraced her new art-for-art's sake creed with the same passion she had once embraced God. </p> <p>She belongs to another age. Paris in the Twenties would have suited her perfectly. Gertrude Stein would have found her manner and her way of life almost too acceptable to mention. </p> <p>Arthur Miller and Anais N\u00efn would not have criticised her for her lack of irony. Scott Fitzgerald would have called her the new Oscar Wilde and Zelda would have kept it from going to her head. No one would have been too upset about her bad behaviour, because wasn't that what writers were put on Earth to do? </p> <p>But the bohemian age is over. Today, if you want to survive in the writing game, you have to learn to think and act corporate. If you don't, it's headline news and then the cold shoulder. It is not surprising that Jeanette Winterson became more of a recluse after the papers gave her the treatment. But even after Gut Symmetries, which got a truly hostile press, her books did not stop selling, and she did not stop writing. </p> <p>Now she has a new book, which she and her publishers have gone out of their way to encourage readers to judge by its cover. It's called The PowerBook, and it looks an awful lot like a Mac. Advance readers who were not put off by this gimmick say that it's as good as her best-loved early novels, even though it has all of the excesses that put so many readers off the later ones. </p> <p>Their descriptions of the book are confusing, because they use the same words people use to describe Jeanette herself: audacious, funny and humourless, clever but infuriating, stagey, authoritative, crazily overstretched and overblown, bullying but at the same time curiously defenceless. A true romantic, they say. Utterly ruthless, but utterly obsessed with love. </p> <p>How can it all add up into one person? Perhaps it doesn't matter how they do their sums, so long as they can find it in themselves to let her be. </p> <p><strong> Jeanette Winterson</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> DoB:</strong> 27 August 1959 </p> <p><strong> Educated:</strong> St Catherine's College, Oxford (BA Hons English) </p> <p><strong> Partner: </strong> Dr M.

      "body": "<p>Down in the mosh pit, while Al Gore was midway through his coming-out speech, two of his aides slapped a high five; his young and idealistic speechwriter, Eli Attie, and seasoned, cynical 'message guru', Carter Eskew.</p> <p>'I stand here tonight,' Gore had just told the electrified crowd, 'as my own man'. It was the moment of the passing of the torch, the handover of the leadership of the Democrat Party - and maybe the White House - by the President who had stolen the show on Monday night. His deputy and political 'son' was now delivering the most important speech of his life.</p> <p>To the delight of Gore's audience and the surprise of many, he rose to the occasion with a declaration of war in a time of peace; with impatience at a time of prosperity and content. Naomi Wolf's 'Alpha Male' had broken free.</p> <p>The speech was unabashedly populist, a class-conscious battle-cry crafted to forge an abyss between himself and his opponent, George W. Bush, who next day accused Gore of 'class warfare'. Gore cast Bush as a defender of 'powerful interests', while he would champion the 'working families of America'.</p> <p>It is a high-risk strategy, which enlivens the struggle against Bush. This now becomes - issue for issue, brick by brick - the most politically polarised election since Ronald Reagan's.</p> <p>'The presidency,' said Gore, 'is more than a popularity contest' - a dig at Bush and, in its way, at Clinton too - 'it is a day-to-day fight for people. There are big choices ahead and a shopping list of reforms in education, health-care, social security, law and order, and our whole future is at stake ... We have got to win this election.' This was not a 'new' Al Gore, but it was - as one of his close aides said - 'as good as he gets', when it mattered most.</p> <p>Gore took a big gamble last week in Los Angeles. He was forced into it not so much by his own convictions as by the most contorted and complex heredity ever bestowed on a politician - a miasma of personal and political relationships.</p> <p>Talking to The Observer after the speech, one of Gore's closest aides said: 'It's been so incredibly complicated - like a family fraught with relationships and loyalties pulling and pushing him in all directions. Clinton, Hillary, Monica, the whole White House thing.'</p> <p>Foremost among those relationships is that with the President, out of whose long shadow Gore had to emerge if he was to live up to the declaration of independence that Attie and Eskew (among others) enjoyed so much.</p> <p>Last week Clinton cast two contradictory shadows over his prot\u00e9g\u00e9: his lambent valediction on Monday night, and the news, leaked on the day of Gore's speech that Special Prosecutor Kenneth Starr's successor is considering re-opening the Monica Lewinsky wound.</p> <p>The President had promised not to step into Gore's spotlight, but he could hardly help being himself. Everyone agreed that Clinton's farewell address was a star performance.</p> <p>Far from setting the stage for Gore, Clinton staked his own personal claim of credit for America's good times. This is something Clinton has always felt he was due, but not granted, as his obsession with his legacy swings between three moods: contrition, whimsical melancholia and Monday's charismatic self-satisfaction. The mood swings are fast and frequent. Last week Clinton went before the cameras to clutch the hand of a tele-evangelist, describe his embarkation upon a 'new life', beg forgiveness for his 'terrible mistakes' and implore the public not to blame Al Gore.</p> <p>Meanwhile, staff in the West Wing talk about Clinton's 'dark moods', which often permeate his speeches in lines that resemble those of an emperor who has seen through his own game of power play - such as, 'in 200 years' time, all of us will have been forgotten'.</p> <p>Then came Monday: Clinton's contrived but effective gladiatorial walk down a tunnel leading to the stage, his shining smile and defiant response to what he took to be a personal affront from George Bush - the notion that he had somehow 'squandered' economic opportunities. It takes that kind of wound - coupled with a sense of occasion - to bring out the magic in Bill Clinton.</p> <p>All three moods in the Clinton bequest created different and complex challenges for Gore last week. Gore had to maintain his distance from the Lewinsky scandal, but needed also to claim some reward for his part in Clinton's roll-call of achievement. On the other hand, he had to do this in a way that enables him to appear as a leader, not a perennial number two.</p> <p>He also needed to find his own manifesto - it would not be enough to promise more of the same - especially because Bush thinks that is his line.</p> <p>There were other pressures too, not least from an even longer shadow across American politics than that of Clinton, and an even more illustrious name - Kennedy. The note sounded by that name was a loud one in Los Angeles last week: it was exactly 40 years ago in LA that John F. Kennedy was nominated by the Democratic convention, announcing the 'New Frontier' in an epic speech which defined the politics and aspirations of a generation.</p> <p>In the year 2000, the bridge between Clinton's big night and that of Gore's began with the remarkable appearance of four Kennedys during Tuesday, notably the secretive Caroline - sole survivor of JFK's immediate family. Her rare, elegant address was a high water mark of the convention, recalling her father's life and death, and saying: 'Now we are the New Frontier, and now that many of us are doing so well, it is time once again to ask more of ourselves. Much as we need a prosperous economy, we also need a prosperity of kindness and decency.'</p> <p>The leader of the clan, Senator Ted, followed with a coded manifesto for everything that he - as guardian of the party's left wing - believes the Clinton administration should have done but did not, mainly in healthcare and social security.</p> <p>In an interview with The Observer , the heir to Camelot - Patrick Kennedy, son of Bobby - said he found it 'surreal' to have his relatives take the stage in this way. 'This is not the real world here,' he said. Now in charge of the Democrats' fundraising, Congressman Kennedy added that 'politics is not about the kind of charisma that my father and uncle had; it is about hard work, everyday hard work'.</p> <p>But all these Kennedy conversations and addresses had one striking feature in common: Clinton was not mentioned. Four decades on, the name Kennedy represented the liberal ideals that Clinton is thought, by the party's left, to have abandoned, or at least sidelined, and which now lodged their claim - from among the party base, at least - with his successor.</p> <p>The challenge to Gore was to balance this claim - and the need to secure his own, still not conquered, party base - against the battle for the centre-ground votes and the 'undecideds', among whom he trails Bush.</p> <p>Faced with this labyrinth of complex and contradictory challenges, the stakes were higher than the expectations when Gore took the podium on Thursday to take President Clinton's baton. In the event, Gore took a gamble.</p> <p>He forged what may emerge as his own brand of unashamed populism, which combined some of Clinton's centrism with a decisive step to the left of the President he has served.</p> <p>At a time when a largely contented electorate shows little taste for political confrontation, Gore laced Clinton's 'New Democrat' vision with more than a touch of the 'Old'. He blasted big oil, big insurance, big tobacco and big everything in bellicose language that belonged more to Franklin Roosevelt's party of the Thirties than that which Clinton returned to the presidential office eight years ago.</p> <p>Gore focused not on what the Clinton administration has done, but what it left undone in the lives of those whom pundits call the 'K-Mart voter', whom Gore promised to champion and characterised as 'people trying to make house payments and car payments, working overtime to pay for college and do right by their kids'. Out of the 5,100 words in his speech, only one of them was 'Clinton'. Twenty were 'fight'.</p> <p>At times, Gore's description of the political landscape even felt like a speech from opposition, rather than from the deputy leader who had painted it.</p> <p>Indeed, George Bush was quick to spot this on Friday, saying that the 'laundry list' of Gore's proposed reforms 'seems like a reflection on past failures'.</p> <p>In his best lines, Gore conceded that he appears 'a bit of a policy wonk' and 'won't always be the most exciting politician', but offered a stark contrast to Clinton with a pledge that: 'I will never let you down.'</p> <p>The list of commitments on children, health insurance, education, guns, abortion and crime was a strident and often ambitious one, and, echoing Caroline Kennedy, Gore promised to 'challenge a culture with too much meanness and not enough meaning'.</p> <p>In the aftermath of the speech, those around Gore were happy, but wary of the electoral task to which this rhetoric now commits them, and those on the left were pleasantly surprised.</p> <p>Harold Ickes is the Democrats' left-wing Svengali figure and a long-time foe of Gore (he privately believes Gore cost him the post of Chief of Staff). He conceded to The Observer: 'It was good. The last quarter, very good.'</p> <p>George Stephanopoulos, a key strategist in both Clinton presidential campaigns, who left Clinton's White House disappointed, told The Observer he thought 'Gore did a good job.

      "bodyText": "Down in the mosh pit, while Al Gore was midway through his coming-out speech, two of his aides slapped a high five; his young and idealistic speechwriter, Eli Attie, and seasoned, cynical 'message guru', Carter Eskew. 'I stand here tonight,' Gore had just told the electrified crowd, 'as my own man'. It was the moment of the passing of the torch, the handover of the leadership of the Democrat Party - and maybe the White House - by the President who had stolen the show on Monday night. His deputy and political 'son' was now delivering the most important speech of his life. To the delight of Gore's audience and the surprise of many, he rose to the occasion with a declaration of war in a time of peace; with impatience at a time of prosperity and content. Naomi Wolf's 'Alpha Male' had broken free. The speech was unabashedly populist, a class-conscious battle-cry crafted to forge an abyss between himself and his opponent, George W. Bush, who next day accused Gore of 'class warfare'. Gore cast Bush as a defender of 'powerful interests', while he would champion the 'working families of America'. It is a high-risk strategy, which enlivens the struggle against Bush. This now becomes - issue for issue, brick by brick - the most politically polarised election since Ronald Reagan's. 'The presidency,' said Gore, 'is more than a popularity contest' - a dig at Bush and, in its way, at Clinton too - 'it is a day-to-day fight for people. There are big choices ahead and a shopping list of reforms in education, health-care, social security, law and order, and our whole future is at stake ... We have got to win this election.' This was not a 'new' Al Gore, but it was - as one of his close aides said - 'as good as he gets', when it mattered most. Gore took a big gamble last week in Los Angeles. He was forced into it not so much by his own convictions as by the most contorted and complex heredity ever bestowed on a politician - a miasma of personal and political relationships. Talking to The Observer after the speech, one of Gore's closest aides said: 'It's been so incredibly complicated - like a family fraught with relationships and loyalties pulling and pushing him in all directions. Clinton, Hillary, Monica, the whole White House thing.' Foremost among those relationships is that with the President, out of whose long shadow Gore had to emerge if he was to live up to the declaration of independence that Attie and Eskew (among others) enjoyed so much. Last week Clinton cast two contradictory shadows over his prot\u00e9g\u00e9: his lambent valediction on Monday night, and the news, leaked on the day of Gore's speech that Special Prosecutor Kenneth Starr's successor is considering re-opening the Monica Lewinsky wound. The President had promised not to step into Gore's spotlight, but he could hardly help being himself. Everyone agreed that Clinton's farewell address was a star performance. Far from setting the stage for Gore, Clinton staked his own personal claim of credit for America's good times. This is something Clinton has always felt he was due, but not granted, as his obsession with his legacy swings between three moods: contrition, whimsical melancholia and Monday's charismatic self-satisfaction. The mood swings are fast and frequent. Last week Clinton went before the cameras to clutch the hand of a tele-evangelist, describe his embarkation upon a 'new life', beg forgiveness for his 'terrible mistakes' and implore the public not to blame Al Gore. Meanwhile, staff in the West Wing talk about Clinton's 'dark moods', which often permeate his speeches in lines that resemble those of an emperor who has seen through his own game of power play - such as, 'in 200 years' time, all of us will have been forgotten'. Then came Monday: Clinton's contrived but effective gladiatorial walk down a tunnel leading to the stage, his shining smile and defiant response to what he took to be a personal affront from George Bush - the notion that he had somehow 'squandered' economic opportunities. It takes that kind of wound - coupled with a sense of occasion - to bring out the magic in Bill Clinton. All three moods in the Clinton bequest created different and complex challenges for Gore last week. Gore had to maintain his distance from the Lewinsky scandal, but needed also to claim some reward for his part in Clinton's roll-call of achievement. On the other hand, he had to do this in a way that enables him to appear as a leader, not a perennial number two. He also needed to find his own manifesto - it would not be enough to promise more of the same - especially because Bush thinks that is his line. There were other pressures too, not least from an even longer shadow across American politics than that of Clinton, and an even more illustrious name - Kennedy. The note sounded by that name was a loud one in Los Angeles last week: it was exactly 40 years ago in LA that John F. Kennedy was nominated by the Democratic convention, announcing the 'New Frontier' in an epic speech which defined the politics and aspirations of a generation. In the year 2000, the bridge between Clinton's big night and that of Gore's began with the remarkable appearance of four Kennedys during Tuesday, notably the secretive Caroline - sole survivor of JFK's immediate family. Her rare, elegant address was a high water mark of the convention, recalling her father's life and death, and saying: 'Now we are the New Frontier, and now that many of us are doing so well, it is time once again to ask more of ourselves. Much as we need a prosperous economy, we also need a prosperity of kindness and decency.' The leader of the clan, Senator Ted, followed with a coded manifesto for everything that he - as guardian of the party's left wing - believes the Clinton administration should have done but did not, mainly in healthcare and social security. In an interview with The Observer , the heir to Camelot - Patrick Kennedy, son of Bobby - said he found it 'surreal' to have his relatives take the stage in this way. 'This is not the real world here,' he said. Now in charge of the Democrats' fundraising, Congressman Kennedy added that 'politics is not about the kind of charisma that my father and uncle had; it is about hard work, everyday hard work'. But all these Kennedy conversations and addresses had one striking feature in common: Clinton was not mentioned. Four decades on, the name Kennedy represented the liberal ideals that Clinton is thought, by the party's left, to have abandoned, or at least sidelined, and which now lodged their claim - from among the party base, at least - with his successor. The challenge to Gore was to balance this claim - and the need to secure his own, still not conquered, party base - against the battle for the centre-ground votes and the 'undecideds', among whom he trails Bush. Faced with this labyrinth of complex and contradictory challenges, the stakes were higher than the expectations when Gore took the podium on Thursday to take President Clinton's baton. In the event, Gore took a gamble. He forged what may emerge as his own brand of unashamed populism, which combined some of Clinton's centrism with a decisive step to the left of the President he has served. At a time when a largely contented electorate shows little taste for political confrontation, Gore laced Clinton's 'New Democrat' vision with more than a touch of the 'Old'. He blasted big oil, big insurance, big tobacco and big everything in bellicose language that belonged more to Franklin Roosevelt's party of the Thirties than that which Clinton returned to the presidential office eight years ago. Gore focused not on what the Clinton administration has done, but what it left undone in the lives of those whom pundits call the 'K-Mart voter', whom Gore promised to champion and characterised as 'people trying to make house payments and car payments, working overtime to pay for college and do right by their kids'. Out of the 5,100 words in his speech, only one of them was 'Clinton'. Twenty were 'fight'. At times, Gore's description of the political landscape even felt like a speech from opposition, rather than from the deputy leader who had painted it. Indeed, George Bush was quick to spot this on Friday, saying that the 'laundry list' of Gore's proposed reforms 'seems like a reflection on past failures'. In his best lines, Gore conceded that he appears 'a bit of a policy wonk' and 'won't always be the most exciting politician', but offered a stark contrast to Clinton with a pledge that: 'I will never let you down.' The list of commitments on children, health insurance, education, guns, abortion and crime was a strident and often ambitious one, and, echoing Caroline Kennedy, Gore promised to 'challenge a culture with too much meanness and not enough meaning'. In the aftermath of the speech, those around Gore were happy, but wary of the electoral task to which this rhetoric now commits them, and those on the left were pleasantly surprised. Harold Ickes is the Democrats' left-wing Svengali figure and a long-time foe of Gore (he privately believes Gore cost him the post of Chief of Staff). He conceded to The Observer: 'It was good. The last quarter, very good.' George Stephanopoulos, a key strategist in both Clinton presidential campaigns, who left Clinton's White House disappointed, told The Observer he thought 'Gore did a good job. Great speech. It's what we've been waiting to hear from him'. The early polls suggest that America broadly agrees, but the test will come over the next few days. One source close to Gore said that the team felt the 'springboard effect of the convention has to bring Gore within three points of Bush, otherwise we're in big trouble'.

Antti Niemi, the home goalkeeper, seemed to have the ball virtually in his hands on his six-yard line when the defender came in to knock it out, but only managed to get it as far as Bobby Petta on the Celtic left. The Dutchman whipped the centre straight to Sutton and the striker headed it to the left of Niemi from eight yards. Hearts had busied themselves around the Celtic goal before this, although they tended to find Jonathan Gould in good form. He had to dive low to his right to prevent Scott Severin's low drive, from a short free-kick, from giving the home side an equaliser in the short time between Sutton's first and second goals. The one which doubled the advantage could not have been more orthodox, Sutton cleanly heading a corner kick from Petta on the right into Niemi's right corner from six yards. Hearts' resurgence was prompted by the appearance of Juanjo and Kris O'Neill in place of Lee Makel and Darren Jackson, the substitutes bringing a youthful liveliness to an attack in particular and a team in general who had seemed discouraged. The new self-belief was strengthened when Severin scored with another fierce low drive from a short free-kick by Colin Cameron. Even when Moravcik restored Celtic's three-goal advantage with a high drive from Sutton's pass, the home side retained enough spirit to continue to give their visitors bother. This was brilliantly illustrated by their second goal. Naysmith released O'Neill down the left, a quick shimmy took the youngster clear of McNamara and his precise centre was bulleted past Gould on the volley from Juanjo, coming in from the right.",

Had United converted even one of those chances, it might have been very different, but Preston went from strength to strength in the second half. United skipper Shaun Murphy had already denied Macken with two superb last-ditch tackles. But when the striker was first to a poor clearance and lobbed the ball over Tracey, Murphy could only deflect the ball into the roof of the net. United lost their discipline late on when Devlin was sent off after kicking out at Paul McKenna, and manager Neil Warnock was ordered out of the dug-out for protesting. Warnock later declined to attend the post-match press conference.",

He is very young and sometimes you forget that even good strikers looked a bit awkward when they started out. </p> <p>'The best of Emile is yet to come.

When he decides to turn and go for goal he is practically unstoppable, he shows that often in training and has got to show that in games. He just needs more self-belief.' </p> <p>The same could be said of his entire team. With seven foreign players and three debutants, Liverpool played for long periods like the cast of Big Brother: a group of strangers thrown together in a dressing room an hour before kick-off. To add to Houllier's concerns, the victory came at a cost. Heskey twisted a knee, which makes him doubtful for tomorrow's visit to Arsenal while his 82nd minute replacement, Patrik Berger, will miss two months after suffering an injury to his lateral knee ligaments. </p> <p>'The downside of the win is the injury factor,' observed Houllier. 'And I don't see why we have to travel and play a game like Arsenal two days after a game like this.' </p> <p>But if the three points were hard-earned and costly, the sheer individual genius of Heskey's decisive contribution lifted some of the gloom, not to mention the pressure mounting on a player who had not previously scored at Anfield. Winning a challenge some 35 yards from goal, he casually brushed past Ian Nolan and David Hopkin before delivering an unstoppable shot into Matt Clarke's goal from a wide angle just inside the area. </p> <p>The goal had been threatened after Liverpool opened the second half in much more determined and incisive fashion, only Clarke stalling the inevitable with a series of excellent blocks. A Steven Gerrard shot was tipped over acrobatically, Nick Barmby headed directly at the keeper, Vladimir Smicer was denied, Michael Owen too, and a goalbound Sammy Hyypia header struck team-mate Dietmar Hamann on the line after a corner following another good Clarke save. </p> <p>It was a dramatic transformation from the first half in which honours belonged to a Bradford team with Benito Carbone on the bench and Dean Windass as a lone striker. Still, it took the legs of Liverpool's keeper, Sander Westerveld, to prevent Windass giving the visitors the lead late in the first half after Lee Sharpe had cleverly played him through. </p> <p>'We got beat and I don't like getting beat,' said new manager Chris Hutchings. 'We were undone by a moment of individual brilliance. In the first half we had created the best two chances but if you don't put them away at this level you get punished and that is what happened.' </p> <p>Arguably, there were more grounds for the visitors to be optimistic than their hosts. Even serial dissident Carbone apparently took his reduced role in good grace. Hutchings said: 'Benito Carbone is a couple of weeks behind in his fitness levels and we always planned on him being on the bench. We discussed it with him and he was fine. He'll train again tonight and on Sunday and we'll take it from there and see how he goes for our next game on Tuesday.' </p> <p>Still, if television producers are looking for a new fly-on-the-wall documentary topic, the Bradford dressing room round about the turn of the year could be a good starting place.</p>",

They will also, presumably, need promissory notes from television companies for enough money to make the upheaval worthwhile. That may be the most difficult aspect of the exercise. What does seem clear is that they are willing to risk their present guarantee of European football every year through their home leagues by participating in a competition in which qualification should be much more difficult to achieve. This is a mute declaration of their belief that even regular participation in the Champions League does not render the kind of money available from television. In this context, the attempted secession can hardly be regarded as treason.",

A year later he quit the game to join a religious sect and last week was arrested for slapping a schoolboy while flashing for money in a Copenhagen shopping centre. Now the sect have confiscated his dog. </p> <p>Elstrup - a striker at Brondby and Odense before Luton - joined 'The Wild Goose' commune on the island of Funen in 1993 under his new name, Darando. 'I feel here that I am seen for who I really am. They understand me better than I do myself, actually, and can really help me,' he explained. </p> <p>Since then, Danish tabloids have kept a close eye on the island, reporting rampant free sex, and the alleged efforts of Wild Goose leaders to relieve Elstrup of his career earnings. At the start of this year, he attempted to resume his salaried career with a comeback for Odense, only to walk out when they refused to pay him during a trial. </p> <p>Most recently he was spotted in the middle of the busiest pedestrian shopping street in Copenhagen circled by a rope, waving his penis at passersby. </p> <p>'In some respects,' he explained, 'I do this to provoke people. I like experiencing people's reactions. Some might take my message to be \"sod off\" and others an offer of sex.

I have not had sex for three months: it is not possible in Odense where women are dead, stuck-up and introverted.' When he tested the theory by repeating the act for the female shoppers of Odense, he was heckled, lost his temper, slapped a laughing schoolboy, wrestled a police officer, was arrested and finally expelled by the Geese. </p> <p>Now, having told police that 'he should have hit the boy harder' and that 'the kid deserved a fist', Elstrup has filed a complaint with the public prosecutor of Funen. 'They are inhuman and the sect even stole Devi, my dachshund. I am now ready to go to the European Court of Human Rights.' He's also, it seems, more than ready to lead the charge to Adamsville.

'If you want to buy a fishing rod for under \u00a35, and within a mile of your front door, we'll tell you where you can get it,' McGhee boasted at the launch, overlooking the lack of fishing rods on the site.

      "body": "<p> Halle Berry is, she reveals, sometimes afflicted with nerves. It's not that in a few hours' time she will have to attend the London premiere of her latest movie, X-Men . Or that she is having, as she puts it, a 'bad hair day' - many women would kill for 'bad' hair like hers. The problem is that, owing to her burgeoning fame, she has attracted that most unwelcome of celebrity accoutrements, a stalker. </p> <p>'There's some guy in Louisiana who's been doing this to me for two years now,' she says, toying with a half-drunk Diet Coke. 'He shows up in LA, comes to my house, my manager's office - scares the shit out of everybody. Then we have to get the police stalking force involved. But until he tries to do something there's nothing we can do. For the most part I put those feelings in their box. But when he does show up, I worry.' </p> <p>Berry might console herself with the thought that the presence of the Louisiana loon is an encouraging sign, professionally at least. What self-respecting Hollywood superstar would be without a personal trainer, personal publicist and personal lunatic fan? It's all part of the star deal these days. </p> <p>For Berry it's been a while coming - X Men is her first copper-bottomed commercial hit. It broke box-office records on its release in the States and looks set to repeat the lucrative trick on this side of the Atlantic. Berry admits: 'I hadn't even heard of the comic books before. Comics are more a boy thing.' </p> <p>Berry plays Storm, a futuristic mutant super-hero whose special power is manipulating the weather, but the role is far from being her cinema debut. She has been working in film for more than a decade, since giving up her career as a model - she was crowned Miss America in the late Eighties - for the more respectable role of a jobbing actress. </p> <p>After her acting debut in TV soaps such as Knot's Landing, the Bruce Willis/Damon Wyans vehicle The Last Boy Scout (1991) introduced Berry to mainstream movie audiences. In the same year she starred as a crack addict in Spike Lee's Jungle Fever and people started to notice her. </p> <p>'I wanted, in a major way, to make a statement,' she says. 'To come out swinging and hopefully have people see me for something other than what was on my resum\u00e9 at the time, which was modelling.' </p> <p>It almost worked. Her performance was critically lauded, yet decent roles weren't forthcoming. Not that her choices were bad - on paper, at least. There was The Flintstones , a summer family caper that arrived at the box office virtually extinct. Then there was the Kurt Russell action movie Executive Decision in 1996, an underrated crowd pleaser which nevertheless performed poorly. Even a re-match with Spike Lee in the form of a cameo in his telephone sex yarn Girl 6 turned out to be ill-starred. </p> <p>And then there was the small matter of turning down the female lead in Speed opposite Keanu Reeves. The role made Sandra Bullock a star, but Berry has no regrets. 'Of all the things I've done so far, nothing has changed my career into Sandra Bullock's, so why would I think that would have? It would have been different for me and I don't have any regrets about not doing it.' </p> <p>Her greatest success hasn't even been seen in Britain. Last year she produced and starred in Introducing Dorothy Dandridge , a TV biopic of the first black actress to be nominated for an Academy Award. It gained Berry herself the TV equivalent, a Golden Globe, and remains her favourite work. 'It took me seven years to get it on screen but I finally did it. It is absolutely my favourite project. I first saw her in Carmen Jones when I was 12 or 13 and I remember thinking just how beautiful she was and how I'd love to grow up and do what she does. I went to the school library to find out all I could about her. All I found was that she was nominated for an Oscar and that she died aged 42.' </p> <p>What's surprising about this is not the adolescent Berry's dedication to Dandridge, but that at 13 she had time to visit the school library. Even as an adolescent she was already on the beauty pageant treadmill and was eventually voted Miss Teen USA, the first time a black girl had won the award. 'I knew it was important because it opened a door for an entire group of people,' she says. 'But it weirded my friends out. All of a sudden you get pushed into the spotlight. People are judging you for all these superficial reasons.' </p> <p> That consciousness of being a black female actor is something that has informed her career. Hollywood might have a variety of prejudices, but, she thinks, things are getting better. 'Wow,' she murmurs when I ask which is the more tricky, in work terms, being a woman or being black. She puts her hands out like a pair of scales. 'Black, woman, woman, black. Any day it could go either way. But I feel that every year little advancements are made.' </p> <p>There's a third prejudice she faces - the stigma of being a 'model-turned-actress', of people seeing only an ex-Miss Ohio. 'I haven't modelled for 12 years,' she says. 'But whatever your path into this business is, that's just your path. I've gotten away from it I hope. And I'm fortunate to get roles and seek roles that allow me to be anything but that.' </p> <p>On 23 February this year Berry's somewhat charmed life took a wrong turn. In the small hours of the morning her rented car collided with a Pontiac Sunbird driven by one Hetal Raythatha. Both women were injured, Berry suffering a head injury that would eventually require 20 stitches. But, suffering from concussion and amnesia, she fled the scene of the accident and was charged with hit-and-run. Predictably the tabloids went berserk. 'It was a very scary time for me,' she remembers. 'The papers go wild on bits of information told to them by ... who? Or they take a tiny piece of information and make it bigger than it is. I've never felt so helpless. Every day of it was a particularly low point. It felt as though I'd been just dropped off in hell and left to burn.' </p> <p>Eventually she was fined and received 200 hours community service. Surprisingly, she says she wouldn't change the events of the last few months. 'What doesn't kill you definitely makes you stronger,' she says. 'You find out who your friends are. And who they're not.' </p> <p>One disappointment she'll take back home from her trip to Britain is being unable to visit Liverpool - for though it's assumed that Berry is all-American, she was born in the city, the daughter of a white English woman and black American. (The Liverpool birthplace has provoked a group of Everton FC fans to send an invitation, asking Berry to consider becoming the club's American 'mascot'!) Soon after Berry's birth, her family moved to America. 'I've always wanted to go there,' she says of Liverpool. 'To see what it's like. I'm aware it's kind of a blue collar town...' </p> <p>Berry says she doesn't believe in grand plans. 'I can't tell you where I'll be in five years. I can tell you what I'm going to have for lunch and that I'll be going to the premiere tonight. Apart from that I'm looking forward to a family and children. Another reason to get up in the morning. Another reason to work.' </p> <p> X-Men is now on general release </p> <p><strong>The Hollywood whitewash</strong></p> <p>In the beginning Hollywood only used black actresses to play 'motherly' servants, like Hattie MacDaniel, who became the first black actor or actress to win an Oscar, for Gone With The Wind . MGM debated 'passing' the light-skinned Lena Horne as a non-specific exotic; after she rejected that, the studio never gave her roles that would make her as big a star as her beauty and fame as a singer warranted.Other black singer-actresses such as Diana Ross, Whitney Houston, Aaliyah and TLC's T-Boz - followed her precedent . </p> <p>By the Fifties, Hollywood knew it had to create some decent roles for African-Americans. The female counterpart to the Poitiers and Belafontes was Dorothy Danbridge, who made a huge impact in Carmen Jones (1954), but died broke 11 years later. The similarly promising career of the brainy, cosmopolitan Diahann Carroll, best seen in Paris Blues (1961), just seemed to stall, at least until Dynasty . Likewise, Pam Grier and Tamara Dobson were doing fine as long as blaxploitation lasted, and then vanished. Even Diana Ross and Whitney Houston only enjoyed temporary screen careers. In recent years Halle Berry, Angela Bassett and more recently Nia Long have built more solid careers, although none has breached the Hollywood A-list. Whoopi Goldberg, a true one-off, has become a casting category of her own.</p>",

How much of it is true remains unclear, but it certainly suggests a talent for grabbing headlines. </p> <p>There's a chance to work out whether she has an equal knack for her day job, acting, in Shanghai Noon . It is an extremely likeable martial arts/western/comedy starring Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson, probably better known for writing Rushmore than for his acting. Liu plays a kidnapped Chinese princess, but she's rather tougher than the damsels in distress of old. </p> <p>For Liu, though, Shanghai Noon is just a prelude to Charlie's Angels , the real test of whether she can thrive in the movies. As one of the three Angels, she gets equal status with the infinitely more famous Drew Barrymore and Cameron Diaz; improbable for a woman who was still billed as 'Toy Store Girl' as recently as last year in True Crime . </p> <p>It was Ally McBeal that turned it around for her. Liu was already aged 29 when she auditioned for a role in the second season of the eccentric legal drama. She didn't get that part, but series supremo David E. Kelley liked her enough to a write a role specifically for her to play in a couple of episodes. </p> <p>And before long, the bitchy, aggressive Ling Woo was one of the most popular characters in the show, the antithesis of Calista Flockhart's dithering eponymous character. Which made it all the more notorious when the two kissed in one episode. 'I'm as honest as Ling,' Liu claims, 'but a little nicer.' </p> <p>She was born in New York City's least glamorous borough, Queens, in 1968. </p> <p>After dropping out of New York University, she ended up doing Asian culture and languages at the University of Michigan and then tried to make a name for herself both as an actress and photographer/ multimedia artist. For a while, she seemed to be doing better at the latter. Her first television appearance was in Beverly Hills 90210 in 1991, her first movie was as an unnamed hooker in Bang in 1995 . </p> <p>It was slow progress until the Ally McBeal audition. </p> <p>Now, if not famous, then she is certainly notorious. Initial rumours that she hit Bill Murray on the Angels' set have been scaled down to a ferocious verbal argument. She was also reportedly unhappy at not being given the same treatment as Barrymore and Diaz. She denies it. </p> <p>'It's too bad people keep saying that I am the cause of all these arguments. I never started any fights.' </p> <p>Producer Lawrence Goldberg backs her up, while admitting there were some problems. 'I guess you would have to say there have been the normal occurrences between people. But is Lucy causing the trouble? No' </p> <p>If the film is a success, all will be forgiven. If not, Liu doesn't look likely to loosen her grip on fame without a struggle. </p>",

She didn't get that part, but series supremo David E. Kelley liked her enough to a write a role specifically for her to play in a couple of episodes. And before long, the bitchy, aggressive Ling Woo was one of the most popular characters in the show, the antithesis of Calista Flockhart's dithering eponymous character. Which made it all the more notorious when the two kissed in one episode. 'I'm as honest as Ling,' Liu claims, 'but a little nicer.' She was born in New York City's least glamorous borough, Queens, in 1968. After dropping out of New York University, she ended up doing Asian culture and languages at the University of Michigan and then tried to make a name for herself both as an actress and photographer/ multimedia artist. For a while, she seemed to be doing better at the latter. Her first television appearance was in Beverly Hills 90210 in 1991, her first movie was as an unnamed hooker in Bang in 1995 . It was slow progress until the Ally McBeal audition. Now, if not famous, then she is certainly notorious. Initial rumours that she hit Bill Murray on the Angels' set have been scaled down to a ferocious verbal argument. She was also reportedly unhappy at not being given the same treatment as Barrymore and Diaz. She denies it. 'It's too bad people keep saying that I am the cause of all these arguments. I never started any fights.' Producer Lawrence Goldberg backs her up, while admitting there were some problems. 'I guess you would have to say there have been the normal occurrences between people. But is Lucy causing the trouble? No' If the film is a success, all will be forgiven. If not, Liu doesn't look likely to loosen her grip on fame without a struggle.",

      "body": "<p>Two words were not being spoken much at the Democrat's convention in Los Angeles: 'Monica' and 'Willard'. Monica needs neither introduction nor explanation, but Willard maybe does; it's the name Bill Clinton gave to his penis, according to another of his women, Gennifer Flowers. Clinton's reasoning: 'It's longer than Willie.' </p> <p>Meanwhile, in Malibu, a few miles up the Californian coast, Willard has been on the mind of one of Hollywood's most intriguing stars. Indeed, Willard is the protagonist in Joe Eszterhas's latest book, American Rhapsody , America's current number four bestseller. </p> <p>Eszterhas is the only movie screenwriter to attain and equal the superstardom of Tinseltown's actors and directors. He has had many famous and infamous ideas during his career walking in and out of Hollywood's portals, looking inside out and outside in. The best known is the 'pussy shot' of Sharon Stone crossing her legs while wearing no knickers in Basic Instinct . </p> <p>But even this was unambitious compared to American Rhapsody , which had political and movie-making circles holding their breath during the months before it was published. It's a hilarious and scandalous book, part-fact, part-fantasy, about a serious subject: Washington observed through the prism of Hollywood and vice versa. </p> <p>The Sharon Stone episode is there in full, along with a string of other fantasies that portray the actress as a dope-smoking, power-obsessed manipulator. Almost the entire Hollywood establishment is treated in the same way: Richard Gere, Michael Douglas, Warren Beatty, Gina Gershon, Glenn Close; many more are named and shamed as vain and self-obsessed. </p> <p>Writs were expected to fly as soon as the book was published and although no one has sued, Stone's agent, for one, has not ruled out action. At Knopf, the book's American publisher, the lawyers were sufficiently concerned to write a 30-page memo. In Britain two publishers have turned it down after taking legal advice. </p> <p>At the heart of American Rhapsody is an outrageous but astute portrait of Bill Clinton as America's 'first rock'n'roll President'; the man who ran the White House as a Hollywood mogul. </p> <p>'Politics has become entertainment,' says Eszterhas, 'and entertainment has become politics. Betty Thomas, who made Private Parts and Dr Dolittle, said that comedy in Hollywood was now \"funny moments with liberal inserts\", and that is right, because Sixties liberals and political correctness have taken over the industry. And the inner dynamics of Hollywood are like politics. Say you give a script to a group of executives - they all sit around, afraid to voice an opinion, saying nothing, waiting to know what the consensus is. Just like focus groups, opinion polls or a cabinet. Meanwhile, politics is about getting a candidate in front of the public as a star, politics as rock'n'roll, politics as a movie.' </p> <p>These mutually reflective prisms are a product of the cult of rock'n'roll, as epitomised by Eszterhas's own progression from Rolling Stone to Hollywood and now the innards of the Clinton scandal. 'I always wanted to be a rock'n'roll star,' admits Hollywood's highest-paid scriptwriter, 'and so did we all. So did Bill Clinton. Fact is we went on to do other things. But we still wanted to do our success like rock'n'roll stars.' </p> <p>That's why Bill should come to Hollywood, as he is urged to do in the pivotal chapter of American Rhapsody , 'Bubba in Pig Heaven'. 'You've got to move out here, Bubba - Hollywood is the place for you - this place reeks sex from its cellular pores. A townful of sluts on the make, Willard-friendly and experimental, bored with ham-and-egg, Al Gore orgasms.' </p> <p>Eszterhas's point is best illustrated by the knotty problem that dominated a year of American politics: the status of oral sex. Blow jobs were central to the Lewinsky scandal. Bill Clinton insisted that blow jobs do not count as sex; much of America agreed. Eszterhas assures the President that oral sex is what manicure girls offer in Hollywood as a matter of routine; they are 'a little break in a busy afternoon', just as they were for Bill in the Oval Office. Same for rock stars in between make-up and the stage. And that's the whole point: 'This is the permeation of rock'n'roll into everything,' says Eszterhas. </p> <p>He was born in Hungary in 1944, the year the country's Jews were rounded up and sent to Auschwitz. 'I've studied the Holocaust extensively,' he says. 'It's my lifelong obsession.' His family fled when the Red Army cut a swathe across the country, as far as Austria, where the boy and his parents were moved from camp to camp by British and American military authorities. </p> <p>After the war, they moved to the rust-belt town of Cleveland, Ohio, where his father edited a Catholic-Hungarian newspaper. Young Joe knew little English, but learned quickly enough to graduate and get a job on the Cleveland Plain Dealer , for which he interviewed Jimi Hendrix. He was obliged to leave the paper, however, after causing it to lose a libel suit to the tune of $16,000, a colossal sum in 1971. At that time, there was only one magazine that would give a home to a man who had developed a lifestyle propelled by a mix of drugs, booze and his Willard (by his own admission). He joined Jan Wenner's Rolling Stone and from there made the move to Hollywood. </p> <p>'I remembered what Hemingway said,' recalls Eszterhas. 'He said, \"Stop at the California state line, don't do it; it'll break your heart\". I decided not to stop and not to let it break my heart.' </p> <p>His first script, which got him into an immediate fight with Sylvester Stallone, was 'Fist' . 'It was 300 pages long. A page a minute - that's a long movie, and that's how little I knew.' At the time, Eszterhas said: 'I have always been fascinated by the corruption of power.' </p> <p>Eszterhas lives in a house on the ocean-front of the Malibu Riviera. Bob Dylan is a neighbour. The greeting is warm and relaxed; his kids charge around covered in sand and seawater. The sofas are decorated with Native American designs and the walls are a shrine to the Sixties: a picture of the Beatles signed by George Harrison; Muhammad Ali; Robert Kennedy. His own scripts - Jagged Edge , Music Box , Telling Lies in Hollywood , Sliver , Basic Instinct - share shelf space with the complete works of Charles Dickens. </p> <p>Eszterhas's wife, Naomi, moves as graciously around this m\u00e9nage as is possible for someone who has given birth to a fourth son, Luke, just two days before. They are blissfully happy, 'but it took me 50 years to get there,' says Eszterhas. Their meeting is a story in itself: Sharon Stone ran off with Eszterhas's friend, Bill McDonald, who duly deserted his wife, Naomi. As an act of friendship, Eszterhas and his wife, Geri, decided to take Naomi on a break, only for the screenwriter and the jilted wife to fall in love. 'If someone asked me if I introduced Bill and Sharon deliberately to get hold of Naomi, I'd say, subliminally, I'm sure they're right.' </p> <p>When most American writers call themselves 'outsiders', one is sceptical. With Eszterhas, you know it's more than partly true. 'I was six when we came to this country. When I was 14 or so, I still had a lot of trouble with it. I saw my father humiliated countless times in limitless ways. Every time I saw that happen, I was thrown into full-blown hysterics, like a two-year-old. I find myself with an immediate understanding of people who are on the outside, the Jews, whatever colour or creed they are. The showgirls, gays and outcasts.' </p> <p>In Hollywood, Eszterhas has done many out-of-the-ordinary things, but one above all. He has made the usually hidden figure of the screenwriter into someone not only visible but also bankable. 'I have only one loyalty - to my writing. I never wanted to be the head of a studio or a producer,' he says. 'I just wanted to make sure that what I write is what appears on screen, to not have some idiot change it on its way to the screen. There sure as hell are some idiots in Hollywood. Complete morons.' </p> <p>This attitude has led Eszterhas into some famous scraps, victories and defeats. It led to his fight with one of the most powerful titans in Hollywood, Mike Ovitz, when Eszterhas left Ovitz's Creative Artists empire to rejoin the agent with whom he originally worked in Hollywood, 'and who gave me my break' - out of loyalty. 'I'm the only sucker in Hollywood to be accused by Ovitz of disloyalty for doing something loyal,' he shrugs. </p> <p>His greatest triumph, he says, was protecting the coda scenes of both Jagged Edge and Flashdance from 'going to the wall in the hands of the directors'. His biggest failure, he says, was the loss of control of a script dear to him, 'written with my friend, Richard Marquand, who later died. It was about an escaped convict and the relationship he had with children. The script was taken and destroyed many years later by Jean-Claude Van Damme as Nowhere to Run . It lost its sensitivity, it lost everything. I don't like to remember that movie.' </p> <p>His favourite among his own movies is Music Box , in which Jessica Lange plays an attorney defending her Hungarian father against accusations that he was a collaborator with the Nazis and a war criminal. It was the most serious film to establish the hallmark Eszterhas theme - that everyone has a past, and that it is not always the past you want people to know about. </p> <p>It was a theme he returned to in Showgirls , which he admits is the least favourite of his own films. In the film, a girl escapes a life of prostitution to join a dance troupe in Vegas. The film contained an infamous rape scene, 'which we should not, I feel now, have shown, although I do insist that to show such a scene does not imply any complicity in it. I worry that we are approaching a time when that which is shocking is squeezed out by the Stalinism of political correctness. I think the messenger was slain for the message. It's against the tyranny of political correctness that American Rhapsody is an assault.' </p> <p>The book took shape after the failure of Showgirls and the sudden convergence of other movies. 'Every time I flicked channels, there I was, talking. I was talking too much and writing too little. So Naomi and I went to Hawaii. The phone was cut off and we lost touch. This gave me the chance to have a good think about my life.' </p> <p>On his return to Los Angeles, the Lewinsky scandal was in full bloom, and Eszterhas became addicted and immersed. 'I had in mind to do a piece for Rolling Stone , but I had no idea that it would become an obsession and a 1,000-page manuscript. Maybe as a writer I was getting hemmed in by scripts. I felt like someone let out of jail and going berserk.' </p> <p>Apart from Bill, Monica and the political cast, the book singles out Sharon Stone for treatment. Eszterhas claims to have 'created' Stone and to have been her lover. He feels a 'proprietary interest' when he hears about the friendship between Clinton and Stone. She was 'Bill Clinton's ideal woman' and 'every bit as political as he', given that 'a star's career is a lifelong political campaign'. She had 'ascended her star on the strength of her privates, but had handled the challenge well'. </p> <p>'I just had this idea that Bill and Sharon wanted to get together and should have got together,' explains Eszterhas. 'But Bill would not have got away with what Hillary has let him get away with. Not only would he have had scratches on his nose, but Sharon can be quite lethal with an ice-pick.' </p> <p>Does he have it in for Sharon Stone? Eszterhas puts on his sincere face. 'Of course not. Who would? She is cuddly and warm.' Cuddly and warm? 'She's a great actress and, like Marilyn Monroe, she's the sex symbol of her time. I'm just saying this: Kennedy-Monroe, Clinton-Stone - it would have been perfect.' </p> <p>Then there's Warren Beatty, whose political ambitions are derided not only because he is 'the man with the golden Willard'. He quotes Joan Collins: 'Three, four, five times a day was not unusual for Warren. And he was able to accept phone calls at the same time.' </p> <p>The most wonderfully insulting reference to Beatty concerns not his sexual prowess but his own presidential ambitions - and his lacking the concentration required to last four years in the White House. In conversation, Eszterhas adds: 'Warren's problem is common for method actors. It's a natural reaction - method actors getting too caught up in their parts. He had done Bulworth and he couldn't let go. He had to pretend that he could do it in real life. You see? Politics as Hollywood and vice versa.' </p> <p>The book also fantasises about Farrah Fawcett Majors defecating on a lawn at a public function and Richard Gere unzipping his flies and revealing 'no boxers' while pitching a movie idea to Eszterhas. </p> <p>Eszterhas said some weeks ago that he still intended to eat at Spago's and 'get good tables'. 'Since then,' he assured me last Wednesday, 'I have eaten there, got an excellent table and many people came up to me to say how much they enjoyed my book, not least because they were not in it.' </p> <p>'He's made a few enemies with this,' one insider told The Observer . But when Tina Brown threw a party for him, 'about 300 of the supposedly offended Hollywood people turned up. Mike Medevos, head of Phoenix, said he loved it and he was happy he wasn't in it. There are plenty more like him.' </p> <p>The White House has nothing to say, even though American Rhapsody is as sympathetic a portrait as Bill Clinton is likely to get in any book that is not by a party-political ally. In understanding the Willard-propulsion of Clinton the man, Eszterhas has explained the drama that befell Clinton the President.

      "bodyText": "Two words were not being spoken much at the Democrat's convention in Los Angeles: 'Monica' and 'Willard'. Monica needs neither introduction nor explanation, but Willard maybe does; it's the name Bill Clinton gave to his penis, according to another of his women, Gennifer Flowers. Clinton's reasoning: 'It's longer than Willie.' Meanwhile, in Malibu, a few miles up the Californian coast, Willard has been on the mind of one of Hollywood's most intriguing stars. Indeed, Willard is the protagonist in Joe Eszterhas's latest book, American Rhapsody , America's current number four bestseller. Eszterhas is the only movie screenwriter to attain and equal the superstardom of Tinseltown's actors and directors. He has had many famous and infamous ideas during his career walking in and out of Hollywood's portals, looking inside out and outside in. The best known is the 'pussy shot' of Sharon Stone crossing her legs while wearing no knickers in Basic Instinct . But even this was unambitious compared to American Rhapsody , which had political and movie-making circles holding their breath during the months before it was published. It's a hilarious and scandalous book, part-fact, part-fantasy, about a serious subject: Washington observed through the prism of Hollywood and vice versa. The Sharon Stone episode is there in full, along with a string of other fantasies that portray the actress as a dope-smoking, power-obsessed manipulator. Almost the entire Hollywood establishment is treated in the same way: Richard Gere, Michael Douglas, Warren Beatty, Gina Gershon, Glenn Close; many more are named and shamed as vain and self-obsessed. Writs were expected to fly as soon as the book was published and although no one has sued, Stone's agent, for one, has not ruled out action. At Knopf, the book's American publisher, the lawyers were sufficiently concerned to write a 30-page memo. In Britain two publishers have turned it down after taking legal advice. At the heart of American Rhapsody is an outrageous but astute portrait of Bill Clinton as America's 'first rock'n'roll President'; the man who ran the White House as a Hollywood mogul. 'Politics has become entertainment,' says Eszterhas, 'and entertainment has become politics. Betty Thomas, who made Private Parts and Dr Dolittle, said that comedy in Hollywood was now \"funny moments with liberal inserts\", and that is right, because Sixties liberals and political correctness have taken over the industry. And the inner dynamics of Hollywood are like politics. Say you give a script to a group of executives - they all sit around, afraid to voice an opinion, saying nothing, waiting to know what the consensus is. Just like focus groups, opinion polls or a cabinet. Meanwhile, politics is about getting a candidate in front of the public as a star, politics as rock'n'roll, politics as a movie.' These mutually reflective prisms are a product of the cult of rock'n'roll, as epitomised by Eszterhas's own progression from Rolling Stone to Hollywood and now the innards of the Clinton scandal. 'I always wanted to be a rock'n'roll star,' admits Hollywood's highest-paid scriptwriter, 'and so did we all. So did Bill Clinton. Fact is we went on to do other things. But we still wanted to do our success like rock'n'roll stars.' That's why Bill should come to Hollywood, as he is urged to do in the pivotal chapter of American Rhapsody , 'Bubba in Pig Heaven'. 'You've got to move out here, Bubba - Hollywood is the place for you - this place reeks sex from its cellular pores. A townful of sluts on the make, Willard-friendly and experimental, bored with ham-and-egg, Al Gore orgasms.' Eszterhas's point is best illustrated by the knotty problem that dominated a year of American politics: the status of oral sex. Blow jobs were central to the Lewinsky scandal. Bill Clinton insisted that blow jobs do not count as sex; much of America agreed. Eszterhas assures the President that oral sex is what manicure girls offer in Hollywood as a matter of routine; they are 'a little break in a busy afternoon', just as they were for Bill in the Oval Office. Same for rock stars in between make-up and the stage. And that's the whole point: 'This is the permeation of rock'n'roll into everything,' says Eszterhas. He was born in Hungary in 1944, the year the country's Jews were rounded up and sent to Auschwitz. 'I've studied the Holocaust extensively,' he says. 'It's my lifelong obsession.' His family fled when the Red Army cut a swathe across the country, as far as Austria, where the boy and his parents were moved from camp to camp by British and American military authorities. After the war, they moved to the rust-belt town of Cleveland, Ohio, where his father edited a Catholic-Hungarian newspaper. Young Joe knew little English, but learned quickly enough to graduate and get a job on the Cleveland Plain Dealer , for which he interviewed Jimi Hendrix. He was obliged to leave the paper, however, after causing it to lose a libel suit to the tune of $16,000, a colossal sum in 1971. At that time, there was only one magazine that would give a home to a man who had developed a lifestyle propelled by a mix of drugs, booze and his Willard (by his own admission). He joined Jan Wenner's Rolling Stone and from there made the move to Hollywood. 'I remembered what Hemingway said,' recalls Eszterhas. 'He said, \"Stop at the California state line, don't do it; it'll break your heart\". I decided not to stop and not to let it break my heart.' His first script, which got him into an immediate fight with Sylvester Stallone, was 'Fist' . 'It was 300 pages long. A page a minute - that's a long movie, and that's how little I knew.' At the time, Eszterhas said: 'I have always been fascinated by the corruption of power.' Eszterhas lives in a house on the ocean-front of the Malibu Riviera. Bob Dylan is a neighbour. The greeting is warm and relaxed; his kids charge around covered in sand and seawater. The sofas are decorated with Native American designs and the walls are a shrine to the Sixties: a picture of the Beatles signed by George Harrison; Muhammad Ali; Robert Kennedy. His own scripts - Jagged Edge , Music Box , Telling Lies in Hollywood , Sliver , Basic Instinct - share shelf space with the complete works of Charles Dickens. Eszterhas's wife, Naomi, moves as graciously around this m\u00e9nage as is possible for someone who has given birth to a fourth son, Luke, just two days before. They are blissfully happy, 'but it took me 50 years to get there,' says Eszterhas. Their meeting is a story in itself: Sharon Stone ran off with Eszterhas's friend, Bill McDonald, who duly deserted his wife, Naomi. As an act of friendship, Eszterhas and his wife, Geri, decided to take Naomi on a break, only for the screenwriter and the jilted wife to fall in love. 'If someone asked me if I introduced Bill and Sharon deliberately to get hold of Naomi, I'd say, subliminally, I'm sure they're right.' When most American writers call themselves 'outsiders', one is sceptical. With Eszterhas, you know it's more than partly true. 'I was six when we came to this country. When I was 14 or so, I still had a lot of trouble with it. I saw my father humiliated countless times in limitless ways. Every time I saw that happen, I was thrown into full-blown hysterics, like a two-year-old. I find myself with an immediate understanding of people who are on the outside, the Jews, whatever colour or creed they are. The showgirls, gays and outcasts.' In Hollywood, Eszterhas has done many out-of-the-ordinary things, but one above all. He has made the usually hidden figure of the screenwriter into someone not only visible but also bankable. 'I have only one loyalty - to my writing. I never wanted to be the head of a studio or a producer,' he says. 'I just wanted to make sure that what I write is what appears on screen, to not have some idiot change it on its way to the screen. There sure as hell are some idiots in Hollywood. Complete morons.' This attitude has led Eszterhas into some famous scraps, victories and defeats. It led to his fight with one of the most powerful titans in Hollywood, Mike Ovitz, when Eszterhas left Ovitz's Creative Artists empire to rejoin the agent with whom he originally worked in Hollywood, 'and who gave me my break' - out of loyalty. 'I'm the only sucker in Hollywood to be accused by Ovitz of disloyalty for doing something loyal,' he shrugs. His greatest triumph, he says, was protecting the coda scenes of both Jagged Edge and Flashdance from 'going to the wall in the hands of the directors'. His biggest failure, he says, was the loss of control of a script dear to him, 'written with my friend, Richard Marquand, who later died. It was about an escaped convict and the relationship he had with children. The script was taken and destroyed many years later by Jean-Claude Van Damme as Nowhere to Run . It lost its sensitivity, it lost everything. I don't like to remember that movie.' His favourite among his own movies is Music Box , in which Jessica Lange plays an attorney defending her Hungarian father against accusations that he was a collaborator with the Nazis and a war criminal. It was the most serious film to establish the hallmark Eszterhas theme - that everyone has a past, and that it is not always the past you want people to know about. It was a theme he returned to in Showgirls , which he admits is the least favourite of his own films. In the film, a girl escapes a life of prostitution to join a dance troupe in Vegas. The film contained an infamous rape scene, 'which we should not, I feel now, have shown, although I do insist that to show such a scene does not imply any complicity in it. I worry that we are approaching a time when that which is shocking is squeezed out by the Stalinism of political correctness. I think the messenger was slain for the message. It's against the tyranny of political correctness that American Rhapsody is an assault.' The book took shape after the failure of Showgirls and the sudden convergence of other movies. 'Every time I flicked channels, there I was, talking. I was talking too much and writing too little. So Naomi and I went to Hawaii. The phone was cut off and we lost touch. This gave me the chance to have a good think about my life.' On his return to Los Angeles, the Lewinsky scandal was in full bloom, and Eszterhas became addicted and immersed. 'I had in mind to do a piece for Rolling Stone , but I had no idea that it would become an obsession and a 1,000-page manuscript. Maybe as a writer I was getting hemmed in by scripts. I felt like someone let out of jail and going berserk.' Apart from Bill, Monica and the political cast, the book singles out Sharon Stone for treatment. Eszterhas claims to have 'created' Stone and to have been her lover. He feels a 'proprietary interest' when he hears about the friendship between Clinton and Stone. She was 'Bill Clinton's ideal woman' and 'every bit as political as he', given that 'a star's career is a lifelong political campaign'. She had 'ascended her star on the strength of her privates, but had handled the challenge well'. 'I just had this idea that Bill and Sharon wanted to get together and should have got together,' explains Eszterhas. 'But Bill would not have got away with what Hillary has let him get away with. Not only would he have had scratches on his nose, but Sharon can be quite lethal with an ice-pick.' Does he have it in for Sharon Stone? Eszterhas puts on his sincere face. 'Of course not. Who would? She is cuddly and warm.' Cuddly and warm? 'She's a great actress and, like Marilyn Monroe, she's the sex symbol of her time. I'm just saying this: Kennedy-Monroe, Clinton-Stone - it would have been perfect.' Then there's Warren Beatty, whose political ambitions are derided not only because he is 'the man with the golden Willard'. He quotes Joan Collins: 'Three, four, five times a day was not unusual for Warren. And he was able to accept phone calls at the same time.' The most wonderfully insulting reference to Beatty concerns not his sexual prowess but his own presidential ambitions - and his lacking the concentration required to last four years in the White House. In conversation, Eszterhas adds: 'Warren's problem is common for method actors. It's a natural reaction - method actors getting too caught up in their parts. He had done Bulworth and he couldn't let go. He had to pretend that he could do it in real life. You see? Politics as Hollywood and vice versa.' The book also fantasises about Farrah Fawcett Majors defecating on a lawn at a public function and Richard Gere unzipping his flies and revealing 'no boxers' while pitching a movie idea to Eszterhas. Eszterhas said some weeks ago that he still intended to eat at Spago's and 'get good tables'. 'Since then,' he assured me last Wednesday, 'I have eaten there, got an excellent table and many people came up to me to say how much they enjoyed my book, not least because they were not in it.' 'He's made a few enemies with this,' one insider told The Observer . But when Tina Brown threw a party for him, 'about 300 of the supposedly offended Hollywood people turned up. Mike Medevos, head of Phoenix, said he loved it and he was happy he wasn't in it. There are plenty more like him.' The White House has nothing to say, even though American Rhapsody is as sympathetic a portrait as Bill Clinton is likely to get in any book that is not by a party-political ally. In understanding the Willard-propulsion of Clinton the man, Eszterhas has explained the drama that befell Clinton the President. And by seeing that drama through Hollywood's eyes , he has spoken for that stubborn 65 per cent of Americans who were unmoved by the whole affair. But there is one thing Eszterhas cannot forgive: the lying. Richard Nixon casts the shadow of evil in this book. 'The important thing,' says Eszterhas, 'was that Nixon was a liar and the Sixties was about telling the truth. Now we had Clinton, jabbing his middle finger at us with a great big fucking lie.'",

      "body": "<p><strong> Observer:</strong> You've subtitled this book, 'A Novel of the Revolution'. Is it just about the American Revolution or something else as well ? </p> <p> <strong> Patrick McGrath:</strong> Centrally it's about the American Revolution, because it's about Martha Peake who would not have come to our notice were it not for her role in the American Revolution. </p> <p> <strong>Obs:</strong> Is she a historical figure ? </p> <p> <strong>McGrath:</strong> She's a complete invention. </p> <p> <strong>Obs:</strong> And is New Morrock, the town to which she emigrates, also an invention? </p> <p> <strong>McGrath:</strong> Completely.</p> <p> <strong>Obs:</strong> So you've borrowed things from all over the place? </p> <p> <strong>McGrath:</strong> Yes, whatever came in handy. I believe the context of the novel is as true to the American Revolution as I could get it, but my own story is invented. </p> <p> <strong>Obs:</strong> There's a rape at the heart of the book. Was that difficult? </p> <p> <strong>McGrath:</strong> It wasn't particularly, once I saw that it was necessary. I wanted the rape to occur for symbolic reasons largely, so that Martha could bear the child of her father in the New World, and then the problem remained of making it work psychologically. </p> <p>I wanted to get at the relationship of England and America, to explore that in terms of a parent-child relationship. I wanted to get at the mythical element within every nation's own history. The simplifications that occur; the distortions that occur in history, or within the transmission of historical fact into national narratives. </p> <p> <strong>Obs:</strong> Was there a specific moment of inspiration for your story? </p> <p> <strong>McGrath:</strong> The overall story was inspired by the story that I think is now becoming familiar, of John Hunter, the anatomist, and his relationship to a man called O'Brien, an 8ft 2in Irish giant, whose skeleton can still be seen in the anatomy museum in Lincoln's Inn Field. </p> <p> <strong>Obs:</strong> So on one level the book is a deliberately Gothic historical novel. Did you enjoy the experience of writing in this genre? </p> <p> <strong>McGrath:</strong> I've always had a leaning towards the Gothic, and the Gothic seems to permeate my imagination, although I never sit down and say I'm going to set out and write a Gothic novel. But in this case I thought I had a chance to actually employ the Gothic in the most precise and proper way, because Gothic is a genre that concerns itself about time, and particularly the way that time both ruins things and also conceals things. I thought these attributes of the genre were perfectly suited to a novel that is to some extent questioning the historical method. </p> <p> <strong>Obs:</strong> But it's also about memory, recollection and story-telling. </p> <p> <strong>McGrath:</strong> Particularly memory as a sort of national attribute. The way that a country will remember its own past in certain ways that tend to reflect its own sense of importance, sense of glory, sense of triumph, sense of the struggles it has come through. The United States is remarkable among nations for this. So I wanted to see if personal memory, the way that we adapt and adjust and distort our memories in order to provide ourselves with the best possible biography, if you couldn't just transfer that process complete to the business of a nation telling its own story through history, with all of the foibles and idiosyncrasies of personal memory. </p> <p> <strong>Obs:</strong> Martha Peake's story is told by an unreliable narrator who is also receiving the narration from a second narrator. Was that technically complex? </p> <p> <strong>McGrath:</strong> It was a struggle to come up with that idea. I had my story, Harry Peake and his relationship with Martha, and then Martha in America. What I didn't have was a frame for it. I didn't know who was to tell this story, and I thought of Martha, I thought of Silas, I thought of the anatomist Lord Drogo, and then it occurred to me to have a young man, Ambrose, come out and speak to an old man. Neither of them is particularly reliable, and yet between them they somehow construct this thing that we will call the 'History of Martha Peake'. </p> <p> <strong>Obs:</strong> The spirit of Dickens hovered in a benign way over much of the book. </p> <p> <strong>McGrath:</strong> I always feel rather blinkered when I am writing a novel, and I seem to be inventing out of a whole cloth somehow, but I think I deliberately feed the imagination by reading. In particular, I read Barnaby Rudge for this book. But there's a certain way in which the reading is absorbed at a level which is not employed in the actual writing. </p> <p>I let that all happen in an unconscious way, so I don't feel threatened by the proximity of Dickensian London. I was more conscious of Hogarth actually than Dickens. </p> <p> <strong>Obs:</strong> Which writers would you say have influenced you the most? </p> <p> <strong>McGrath:</strong> I think it's more a matter of books. I have a personal canon which would include Death in Venice and Heart of Darkness, Wuthering Heights, probably Brideshead Revisited, Doctor Jekyll and Mr Hyde, The Picture of Dorian Gray, Dracula. Probably for this one, I think, Roderick Random, I re-read that for this and went through my Fielding and my Johnson and Boswell. </p> <p>But I think that little clutch of rather dark nineteenth, early twentieth-century novels and novellas would be my personal canon. </p> <p> <strong>Obs:</strong> At times, the novel seems reminiscent of Stevenson. </p> <p> <strong>McGrath:</strong> When I'd finished my previous book, Asylum, I wanted very consciously to write something that was much more driven by plot and narrative than by internal psychological development and went back to Stevenson and read things like Kidnapped and Treasure Island as well as Jekyll and Hyde. </p> <p>I thought I would write a novel that gives the same sorts of pleasures that Stevenson does, and also John Buchan as well - romantic adventure. The idea was to get a sort of Stevensonian narrative pleasure working in the book, if at all possible. </p> <p> <strong>Obs:</strong> How long did it take to write? </p> <p> <strong>McGrath:</strong> Four years, which was largely spent immersed in American Revolutionary history, so as not to make a fool of myself. </p> <p> <strong>Obs:</strong> Did you go out to Boston? </p> <p> <strong>McGrath:</strong> I did a tour of New England and tramped about battlefields and so forth. </p> <p> <strong>Obs:</strong> Is New Morrock based on anywhere? </p> <p> <strong>McGrath:</strong> It's generic north Massachusetts or Maine, which at that time was part of Massachusetts. It seems a bit wild to be Massachusetts, so I imagine that it's somewhere in Maine. Actually it feels to me more Cornish than American. The cliffs of Maine don't tend to rise to those heights. </p> <p> <strong>Obs:</strong> What are you writing now? </p> <p> <strong>McGrath:</strong> Nothing at the moment. I'm mulling and reading and thinking and preparing to write. Something contemporary, I think. </p> <p> <strong>Obs:</strong> But Gothic? </p> <p> <strong>McGrath:</strong> I don't know. As I say, I don't start off thinking I'm going to write a Gothic novel. </p> <p> <strong>Obs:</strong> But that's your subject, isn't it ? </p> <p> <strong>McGrath:</strong> Yes, I suppose insanity has always been of great interest. </p> <p> <strong>Obs:</strong> Why is that? </p> <p> <strong>McGrath:</strong> Probably I got it from my father, who was a psychiatrist in charge of Broadmoor from 1955 to 1981. He taught me to see that the insane are ill rather than monstrous, and that they deserve the same sympathy and respect that any ill person deserves. I think my childhood gave me a moral position from which to develop character. I found that when I began to write fiction I ran through a number of genres in my first year and settled then on some sort of pastiche of Edgar Allan Poe, and sensed that I was on the territory that I should be on. </p> <p> <strong>Obs:</strong> And did you always want to be a writer? </p> <p> <strong>McGrath:</strong> I did, but then that sort of dream was submerged for about a decade from my late teens to my late twenties - when I thought that I should be doing a more socially responsible activity, much under the influence partly of the time and partly of my family, all of whom ended up being doctors or teachers of one sort or another. </p> <p>But in the end that didn't work out, so I returned to the notion of writing as a last resort.</p>",

And there's a wonderful sense of rightness about Patrick McGrath, the best of Gothic novelists, turning back to the period and writing this astonishing historical novel. For some time, I toyed with various reviewer's formulae along the lines of 'McGrath is the best Gothic novelist since'... Since who? Mary Shelley? Ann Radcliffe? Forget it. McGrath may be the best Gothic novelist ever. </p> <p>The remarkable thing about McGrath is that, though he works within the conventions of his genre, he always seems to see the full range of their implications.

      "bodyText": "Martha Peake Patrick McGrath Viking \u00a312.99, pp352 Buy it at BOL Gothic was an eighteenth-century invention, of course. And there's a wonderful sense of rightness about Patrick McGrath, the best of Gothic novelists, turning back to the period and writing this astonishing historical novel. For some time, I toyed with various reviewer's formulae along the lines of 'McGrath is the best Gothic novelist since'... Since who? Mary Shelley? Ann Radcliffe? Forget it. McGrath may be the best Gothic novelist ever. The remarkable thing about McGrath is that, though he works within the conventions of his genre, he always seems to see the full range of their implications. Gothic, for McGrath, is not just a literary mode which may be dropped into or out of at will; it is the state of mind we have lived in since the Enlightenment. One of the most pleasing things about Martha Peake is that it doesn't see the haunted house terrors which the late eighteenth century liked so much as an irrelevant diversion from its more serious inquiries.

I just wouldn't like to meet Patrick on a dark night in the jungle. </p> <p>Trezza Azzopardi is the only person I can think of with four zeds in her name; she is also an extraordinarily instinctive writer with a delicate feel for language. The narrator of <strong> The Hiding Place</strong>, Dolores, is a five-year-old girl living in a community of Maltese immigrants in Cardiff's Tiger Bay. As one of her relatives puts it: ' \"This place - it's a little world, right?\" he said, cupping his hands together as if he had captured a moth.' </p> <p>Her father is the feckless Frankie Gauci who came to seek his fortune but found instead a wife, a taste for gambling and a dangerously close-knit ghetto run by the Maltese mafia. He is given the nickname Frankie Bambina because of his failure to sire a son and on the night Dolores, his sixth daughter, is born, he loses his house and his business at the card table. The mother has to hide the baby in chest: ' \"He would've smothered you, she said\".' The Hiding Place has been compared with the work of Frank McCourt and Andrea Ashworth and it is not hard to see why. But Azzopardi's book is fiction and it has a certain poise and cohesion of theme that cannot be achieved in memoir. </p> <p>The most startling and lyrical passage is the description of how Dolores was burnt as a baby. Her 'right hand is fine' but on her left she 'lost the fingers. At one month old, a baby's hand is the tiniest, most perfect thing... that soft skin is petrol, those bones are tinder, so small, so easily eaten in a flame.' She thinks of it as 'a closed white tulip standing in the rain'; her father, however, refers to her as 'La Sinistra'.</p> <p>The fire is the point of no return for the Gaucis. Fire and skin become unavoidable and dangerous elements in their lives: Fran, sister number four, becomes a pyromaniac; the sisters subject each other to primitive tattoos with knives and needles; the eldest sister's patent boots melt and ruin beside a gas fire while she struggles against the enforced attentions of her boss; it is the children's skin that is marked and flayed by the belt of the father. </p> <p>One by one the sisters disappear from the family - Fran into care, Celesta into marriage with a balding businessman in return for favours and, most shockingly, Marina is sold to the mafia head to clear the father's debts. Azzopardi has written a scalding, thrilling book about the havoc and despair it is possible to wreak inside a family; but also how the bonds formed within it cannot be destroyed by violence, poverty, time, fire - anything. </p> <p>Eleanor Bailey addresses similar themes in her debut, <strong> Idioglossia</strong>, a novel about the interlocking lives of four generations of women, all pulling in different directions. </p> <p>Great Edie is an eccentric immigrant whose progeny don't share her colourful self-assurance: Grace, her daughter, is a schizophrenic who spends her life in asylums. Maggie, Grace's daughter, is torn between trying to persuade Great Edie into the bath, looking after a mystifying and barely conscious mother, and keeping an eye on her fragile daughter, Sarah, who is given to packing in her jobs and random sex with strangers. </p> <p>It's a complex story with satisfyingly diverse characters, all of whom are blighted by secrets sealed up in the past: cleaning and the desire to clear away debris, actual or imagined, is something they all do at some point in the book. Great Edie was my favourite. I liked the Gothic awfulness of her refusal to wash, her staggeringly foul-mouthed insults, her insanitary house, and her wild psychic predictions.</p>",

William Hazlitt, Romantic critic and personality, once fell in love with a maid and then wrote an account of it, published in 1824, called Liber Amoris. </p> <p> The Far Side of a Kiss takes up this gossip's morsel and offers the other side of the story, as told by Sarah, the maid. In a relentless trial by tedium, the reader is treated to all of Sarah's fancies and anxieties, all her faux moralising and self-serving strategising. </p> <p>The effect is rather like being stuck in a sealed box with a linguistically impoverished version of Richardson's heroine Pamela (or, more accurately, Fielding's skit, Shamela). And where Pamela merely promises, Sarah shows all.</p> <p>This is a novel absolutely littered with grabbings and peckings, a gruesome array of nudges, winks, bum-taps and breast-pokes and, finally, a rape scene described in tones of triumphant gothic melodrama. </p> <p>This is all happening in the early decades of the nineteenth century, a fact which Haverty makes clear to us by having her characters describe past actions with 'he is come' and 'he is done' and inverting verbs after 'thus' -'Thus are all men used to talking of their wives' etc. </p> <p>A few other period touches are added by Sarah's rather surprising knowledge of the personal lives of the literary figures of the age: 'Mr Lamb must indeed be the kindest of men, but among the most foolish too, for he keeps his sister, who went mad and killed their mother, loose in his house'; 'Mr Keats was a poor sick fellow gone off to Italy for the good of his health.' </p> <p>The real-life Hazlitt was arguably possessed of one of the most agile and promiscuous minds of the age. Nevertheless, in Haverty's world, he confines himself to two modest obsessions: the game of fives, from which Hazlitt seems (qua the football-mad lads of recent years) unable to desist, and a delirious and clearly excessive consumption of tea. This seems a poor show, from the writer, critic, Coleridge-trouncer, mesmerising polemicist and scourge of the age. </p> <p>If Hazlitt's written words are anything to go by, he was prone to sparkling pronouncements such as: 'Mr Wordsworth's genius is a pure emanation of the Spirit of the Age' or: 'We have said that Lord Byron is a sublime coxcomb; why should we not say that Mr [Leigh] Hunt is a delightful one?' Whether he downed his lexical rifles in conversation with maids is not known. </p> <p>However, it seems unlikely that, even in a moment of overwhelming tenderness, Hazlitt would have cajoled his maid to 'let me see if your bubbies have grown'. Or that he would, upon proposing marriage to her, have fallen into the sort of 'half-laughter, half-crying' more usually seen on The Royle Family, 'declaring he was happy fit to burst'. </p> <p>There is certainly no such hatefulness in Liber Amoris, which lurches chaotically between letter, dialogue and epigram, spanning wild arcs from fantastical ecstasy to dwindling melancholy. The Hazlitt of Liber Amoris, though self-indulgent, ravenous and selfish, is constantly multi-faceted and fascinating. He lies on his back all day, thinking of Sarah. He fears he is 'falling into a pit, without a hand to help me'. The hysteria passio comes upon him, hurling him towards lunacy; he infuriates his acquaintance by dwelling minutely on all Sarah's whispers and touches. </p> <p>Haverty's loose, idle book misses the main joy of Liber Amoris, which is the many-mooded nature of Hazlitt's obsession and the many-sided nature of Hazlitt himself. Instead, she makes him an ahistorical, whingeing, old lecher, grabbing and pinching, salivating and beseeching, babbling his protestations in a hybrid babble of mock-archaism and lewd grotesquerie. </p> <p>The combination of a mercilessly one-dimensional Hazlitt and a mercilessly archetyped age makes for a filthy, pseudo-historical misfire, a novel which relies on the mere mention of a famous literary character to secure its credentials as 'serious' or, equally mendaciously, plays the 'previously silenced female speaks' card to ensure a splash at Silver Moon. </p> <p>This is a tale which sticks relentlessly to an age-old draw - the bodice unbuttoned.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Far Side of a Kiss Anne Haverty Chatto &amp; Windus \u00a312.99, pp241 Buy it at BOL The Far Side of a Kiss, the second novel by Irish author Anne Haverty, is costume drama in a state of salacious undress. William Hazlitt, Romantic critic and personality, once fell in love with a maid and then wrote an account of it, published in 1824, called Liber Amoris. The Far Side of a Kiss takes up this gossip's morsel and offers the other side of the story, as told by Sarah, the maid. In a relentless trial by tedium, the reader is treated to all of Sarah's fancies and anxieties, all her faux moralising and self-serving strategising. The effect is rather like being stuck in a sealed box with a linguistically impoverished version of Richardson's heroine Pamela (or, more accurately, Fielding's skit, Shamela). And where Pamela merely promises, Sarah shows all. This is a novel absolutely littered with grabbings and peckings, a gruesome array of nudges, winks, bum-taps and breast-pokes and, finally, a rape scene described in tones of triumphant gothic melodrama. This is all happening in the early decades of the nineteenth century, a fact which Haverty makes clear to us by having her characters describe past actions with 'he is come' and 'he is done' and inverting verbs after 'thus' -'Thus are all men used to talking of their wives' etc. A few other period touches are added by Sarah's rather surprising knowledge of the personal lives of the literary figures of the age: 'Mr Lamb must indeed be the kindest of men, but among the most foolish too, for he keeps his sister, who went mad and killed their mother, loose in his house'; 'Mr Keats was a poor sick fellow gone off to Italy for the good of his health.' The real-life Hazlitt was arguably possessed of one of the most agile and promiscuous minds of the age. Nevertheless, in Haverty's world, he confines himself to two modest obsessions: the game of fives, from which Hazlitt seems (qua the football-mad lads of recent years) unable to desist, and a delirious and clearly excessive consumption of tea. This seems a poor show, from the writer, critic, Coleridge-trouncer, mesmerising polemicist and scourge of the age. If Hazlitt's written words are anything to go by, he was prone to sparkling pronouncements such as: 'Mr Wordsworth's genius is a pure emanation of the Spirit of the Age' or: 'We have said that Lord Byron is a sublime coxcomb; why should we not say that Mr [Leigh] Hunt is a delightful one?' Whether he downed his lexical rifles in conversation with maids is not known. However, it seems unlikely that, even in a moment of overwhelming tenderness, Hazlitt would have cajoled his maid to 'let me see if your bubbies have grown'. Or that he would, upon proposing marriage to her, have fallen into the sort of 'half-laughter, half-crying' more usually seen on The Royle Family, 'declaring he was happy fit to burst'. There is certainly no such hatefulness in Liber Amoris, which lurches chaotically between letter, dialogue and epigram, spanning wild arcs from fantastical ecstasy to dwindling melancholy. The Hazlitt of Liber Amoris, though self-indulgent, ravenous and selfish, is constantly multi-faceted and fascinating. He lies on his back all day, thinking of Sarah. He fears he is 'falling into a pit, without a hand to help me'. The hysteria passio comes upon him, hurling him towards lunacy; he infuriates his acquaintance by dwelling minutely on all Sarah's whispers and touches. Haverty's loose, idle book misses the main joy of Liber Amoris, which is the many-mooded nature of Hazlitt's obsession and the many-sided nature of Hazlitt himself. Instead, she makes him an ahistorical, whingeing, old lecher, grabbing and pinching, salivating and beseeching, babbling his protestations in a hybrid babble of mock-archaism and lewd grotesquerie. The combination of a mercilessly one-dimensional Hazlitt and a mercilessly archetyped age makes for a filthy, pseudo-historical misfire, a novel which relies on the mere mention of a famous literary character to secure its credentials as 'serious' or, equally mendaciously, plays the 'previously silenced female speaks' card to ensure a splash at Silver Moon. This is a tale which sticks relentlessly to an age-old draw - the bodice unbuttoned.",

He is admirably intent on rescuing literature from the arcane rituals of US academia and restoring it to a wider audience. Even so, you cannot help suspecting that this rambling, platitudinous stuff is about the best he can now muster. As with all his work, a certain desperation runs beneath the heroism.

'The creator of Sir John Falstaff, of Hamlet, and of Rosalind,' he tells us, 'also makes me wish I could be more myself.' There are those malicious souls for whom Bloom is quite enough himself without there being even more of him, but the notion of reading as a kind of self-entrepreneurship is plain enough. </p> <p>Why does Bloom need to augment the self? 'We read,' he suggests, 'not only because we cannot know enough people, but because friendship is so vulnerable, so likely to diminish or disappear, overcome by space, time, imperfect sympathies and all the sorrows of familial and passional life.'

Venturing tentatively into the dingy little shop heaped with piano wire and swathes of felt, he inquired whether he might buy a used piano and received a polite but cryptic rebuff from the old man who appeared from a mysterious door at the back.</p> <p>Undeterred, Carhart returned again and again to the shop and eventually, after securing a masonic introduction from one of Desforges's clients, he was allowed through the back door into an Aladdin's Cave of disembowelled pianos that had found their way from all over Europe to this vast, hidden atelier. </p> <p>Carhart's book is the story of his relationship with Luc, the piano restorer whose craftsmanship and love for his instruments seems to belong to another century, and with the curious assortment of people who, like initiates of a secret cult, are allowed into Luc's workshop to share their passion for the beautiful piano - some valuable antiques - that he nurses back to health.</p> <p>The book unfolds slowly, so that you may wonder after the first chapter whether Luc and his atelier can provide enough material to furnish an entire book - after all, there are only so many ways to describe dusty sunlight falling on rich mahogany - but Carhart uses the piano shop as a starting place for several strands of story in alternating chapters. Remembering his childhood in Paris, he returns to his first relationship with the piano and switches back and forth between these childhood anecdotes and the renewed passion for the instrument that Luc's pianos inspire. </p> <p>Luc finds him a baby grand, a plucky little Stingl that is both bigger and more expensive than the author had planned, but Carhart immediately finds himself captivated by the sensual pleasures of a beautifully made instrument: 'Good God, I thought, this is a kind of love; and, as in love, my senses amplified and enhanced the love object, all with an insouciance and willing enthusiasm.'</p> <p>But he has already learned Luc's distaste for people who treat pianos like an exquisite piece of furniture to display their wealth and taste (' \"They might as well park a Mercedes at the end of their grands salons,\" he would rail'), and determines to take up lessons again so as to be worthy of his new possession. </p> <p>Between these personal stories lies perhaps the most fascinating part of the book - a potted history of the piano from its origins to its heyday in the mid- to late-nineteenth century, and of the composers whose music developed alongside the technical advances of the instrument.</p> <p>In 1774 Voltaire wrote 'Le pianoforte est un instrument de chaudronnier en comparaison du clavecin' ('The piano is a boilermaker's instrument compared with the harpsichord'), but only three years later Mozart was enthusing about the new instruments, though the Viennese-made pianos on which he and Haydn composed were small and delicate and not unlike the harpsichord. Beethoven was known to destroy them with the ferocity of his playing, until the English manufacturers of the early nineteenth century began to produce more robust models, such as the Broadwood on which he composed his most dramatic piano sonata, the Hammerklavier. </p> <p>This is a gentle, meandering book, a collage of images, memories and history, and at times Carhart's effort to stuff these miscellaneous elements into a narrative feels a little strained. But the book is rich with understated evocations of Paris; Carhart has an eye for the salient detail that will conjure a person or a street vividly without tripping up in overwrought description. </p> <p>He also writes with enthusiasm about the individual instruments he encounters, with a habit evidently learned from Luc of viewing each instrument as a living creature with its own personality, and his delight in the look and feel of a piano - the sheen of different woods, the curvature of the ivory keys - translates easily into prose. </p> <p>Perhaps the best recommendation of his book is that it makes you want to reach immediately for Beethoven, Chopin, Mozart, Bach, Scarlatti and the other composers whose names litter the book; if his aim was to inspire in his readers a renewed love for the music, he has succeeded admirably.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Piano Shop on the Left Bank TE Carhart Chatto &amp; Windus \u00a315.99, pp242 Buy it at BOL The narrow cobbled ruelles that lattice the Left Bank of the Seine conceal all kinds of treasures which the tourist, breezing past with map and Rough Guide, would never know existed; half-hidden bookshops, cluttered galleries of maps and paintings, artists' and musicians' studios, or workshops crafting anything from furniture to pianos. It was the latter that American writer TE Carhart stumbled upon almost by accident, intrigued by the unassuming shop front he passed every day that read simply ' Desforges Pianos: outillage, fournitures'. Venturing tentatively into the dingy little shop heaped with piano wire and swathes of felt, he inquired whether he might buy a used piano and received a polite but cryptic rebuff from the old man who appeared from a mysterious door at the back. Undeterred, Carhart returned again and again to the shop and eventually, after securing a masonic introduction from one of Desforges's clients, he was allowed through the back door into an Aladdin's Cave of disembowelled pianos that had found their way from all over Europe to this vast, hidden atelier. Carhart's book is the story of his relationship with Luc, the piano restorer whose craftsmanship and love for his instruments seems to belong to another century, and with the curious assortment of people who, like initiates of a secret cult, are allowed into Luc's workshop to share their passion for the beautiful piano - some valuable antiques - that he nurses back to health. The book unfolds slowly, so that you may wonder after the first chapter whether Luc and his atelier can provide enough material to furnish an entire book - after all, there are only so many ways to describe dusty sunlight falling on rich mahogany - but Carhart uses the piano shop as a starting place for several strands of story in alternating chapters. Remembering his childhood in Paris, he returns to his first relationship with the piano and switches back and forth between these childhood anecdotes and the renewed passion for the instrument that Luc's pianos inspire. Luc finds him a baby grand, a plucky little Stingl that is both bigger and more expensive than the author had planned, but Carhart immediately finds himself captivated by the sensual pleasures of a beautifully made instrument: 'Good God, I thought, this is a kind of love; and, as in love, my senses amplified and enhanced the love object, all with an insouciance and willing enthusiasm.' But he has already learned Luc's distaste for people who treat pianos like an exquisite piece of furniture to display their wealth and taste (' \"They might as well park a Mercedes at the end of their grands salons,\" he would rail'), and determines to take up lessons again so as to be worthy of his new possession. Between these personal stories lies perhaps the most fascinating part of the book - a potted history of the piano from its origins to its heyday in the mid- to late-nineteenth century, and of the composers whose music developed alongside the technical advances of the instrument. In 1774 Voltaire wrote 'Le pianoforte est un instrument de chaudronnier en comparaison du clavecin' ('The piano is a boilermaker's instrument compared with the harpsichord'), but only three years later Mozart was enthusing about the new instruments, though the Viennese-made pianos on which he and Haydn composed were small and delicate and not unlike the harpsichord. Beethoven was known to destroy them with the ferocity of his playing, until the English manufacturers of the early nineteenth century began to produce more robust models, such as the Broadwood on which he composed his most dramatic piano sonata, the Hammerklavier. This is a gentle, meandering book, a collage of images, memories and history, and at times Carhart's effort to stuff these miscellaneous elements into a narrative feels a little strained. But the book is rich with understated evocations of Paris; Carhart has an eye for the salient detail that will conjure a person or a street vividly without tripping up in overwrought description. He also writes with enthusiasm about the individual instruments he encounters, with a habit evidently learned from Luc of viewing each instrument as a living creature with its own personality, and his delight in the look and feel of a piano - the sheen of different woods, the curvature of the ivory keys - translates easily into prose. Perhaps the best recommendation of his book is that it makes you want to reach immediately for Beethoven, Chopin, Mozart, Bach, Scarlatti and the other composers whose names litter the book; if his aim was to inspire in his readers a renewed love for the music, he has succeeded admirably.",

      "body": "<p>The race to save the crew of the stricken Russian submarine Kursk reached a chilling climax last night when military leaders admitted there was no longer any realistic hope of finding the men alive. The grim statement came as a British rescue mission arrived above where the nuclear-powered submarine sank eight days ago.</p> <p>In a sombre announcement, Mikhail Motsak, chief of the Northern Fleet general staff, told the Russian nation in a special television broadcast: 'Our worst expectations have come true.'</p> <p>He described the tragedy as 'the gravest disaster ... known in the history of the [Russian] submarine fleet' but said rescue efforts would continue none the less. Yesterday Russian rescuers again failed to link up with the stricken submarine trapped 50 miles off the country's northern coast.</p> <p>His broadcast was greeted with anger and grief throughout the country. The President, Vladimir Putin, was attacked yesterday for failing to break the bad news himself.</p> <p>Putin's decision to remain at Sochi, his official holiday residence on the Black Sea for most of the crisis, has been hugely unpopular and is being seen as his first major miscalculation as leader.</p> <p>Former President Mikhail Gorbachev joined the chorus of criticism yesterday, saying Putin had made a 'serious mistake' by not taking control of the rescue operation earlier.</p> <p>The accident has devastated those living and working in the naval bases that litter the north of Russia.</p> <p>In Murmansk, the regional centre and home town of many of the Kursk's crew, people were bitter.</p> <p>'Everybody is furious at how slowly the rescue operation was carried out,' said Lydumila Zaitseva, whose husband is a sailor. 'We have all been badly let down.' At about 4pm yesterday the Royal Navy rescuers, equipped with a state-of-the-art 'mini-sub', reached a position over the Kursk. They hoped to manoeuvre their vessel next to the damaged sub's rear escape hatch and form an airlock through which any survivors could escape.</p> <p>The British team talked to Russian and Norwegian divers already on the scene. The Norwegian divers are likely to descend to reconnoitre the best approach for the \u00a38 million Royal Navy craft, the LR5.</p> <p>The co-ordinator of the Royal Navy operation, Commander Mike Finney, said outside the Ministry of Defence in London last night that a full assessment of the site needed to be carried out before any dive. The Russians had provided the British with drawings of the Kurk's crucial escape hatch.</p> <p>But it now seems certain that the crew of the Kursk are indeed dead. In his statement yesterday Motsak described how the men in its front part of the vessel died instantly in the huge explosion that sent the 14,000 tonne submarine to the bottom of the Barents Sea.</p> <p>'Most likely the whole of the front section has been flooded and the staff in those sections died in the first minutes of the accident,' Motsak said.

      "bodyText": "The race to save the crew of the stricken Russian submarine Kursk reached a chilling climax last night when military leaders admitted there was no longer any realistic hope of finding the men alive. The grim statement came as a British rescue mission arrived above where the nuclear-powered submarine sank eight days ago. In a sombre announcement, Mikhail Motsak, chief of the Northern Fleet general staff, told the Russian nation in a special television broadcast: 'Our worst expectations have come true.' He described the tragedy as 'the gravest disaster ... known in the history of the [Russian] submarine fleet' but said rescue efforts would continue none the less. Yesterday Russian rescuers again failed to link up with the stricken submarine trapped 50 miles off the country's northern coast. His broadcast was greeted with anger and grief throughout the country. The President, Vladimir Putin, was attacked yesterday for failing to break the bad news himself. Putin's decision to remain at Sochi, his official holiday residence on the Black Sea for most of the crisis, has been hugely unpopular and is being seen as his first major miscalculation as leader. Former President Mikhail Gorbachev joined the chorus of criticism yesterday, saying Putin had made a 'serious mistake' by not taking control of the rescue operation earlier. The accident has devastated those living and working in the naval bases that litter the north of Russia. In Murmansk, the regional centre and home town of many of the Kursk's crew, people were bitter. 'Everybody is furious at how slowly the rescue operation was carried out,' said Lydumila Zaitseva, whose husband is a sailor. 'We have all been badly let down.' At about 4pm yesterday the Royal Navy rescuers, equipped with a state-of-the-art 'mini-sub', reached a position over the Kursk. They hoped to manoeuvre their vessel next to the damaged sub's rear escape hatch and form an airlock through which any survivors could escape. The British team talked to Russian and Norwegian divers already on the scene. The Norwegian divers are likely to descend to reconnoitre the best approach for the \u00a38 million Royal Navy craft, the LR5. The co-ordinator of the Royal Navy operation, Commander Mike Finney, said outside the Ministry of Defence in London last night that a full assessment of the site needed to be carried out before any dive. The Russians had provided the British with drawings of the Kurk's crucial escape hatch. But it now seems certain that the crew of the Kursk are indeed dead. In his statement yesterday Motsak described how the men in its front part of the vessel died instantly in the huge explosion that sent the 14,000 tonne submarine to the bottom of the Barents Sea. 'Most likely the whole of the front section has been flooded and the staff in those sections died in the first minutes of the accident,' Motsak said. The dead would have included the captain and almost all the senior officers. The submarine's control centre would have been completely disabled. Motsak revealed that the Russian high command had considerably more information about the condition of those sailors who survived the blast than had been previously thought. Survivors were still hammering messages on the hull of the sub 48 hours after hitting the ocean floor, he said, and appeared to have been trapped in air pockets in the back of the vessel. Motsak described how the stranded seamen banged out desperate signals to warn rescuers that water was leaking in and slowly depriving them of oxygen and increasing the air pressure. For the first time Motsak gave details of what the Russians believe caused the accident. The first theory, he said, was that there had been some kind of collision. 'It is very possible that the cause of the accident was a strong dynamic blow which could have been caused by several factors.' The second theory involved massive flooding following an explosion in one of the submarine's forward compartments. The third theory - and the one that Motsak said he favoured - involved a Second World War mine. Motsak's broadcast revealed that the Russian Navy had discovered six such mines in the last seven years. 'I cannot exclude this option,' he said, 'particularly because the initial explosion [on the submarine] was caused by only 100kg of explosive and the submarine does not have such small warheads on its torpedoes.' The Russians' have consistently played down the British team's ability to help. Observers believe that this is a hint that the Kremlin may forbid the Royal Navy team to dive. The Russian authorities' fear of exposing secret military information to the West during a rescue has been cited as one reason why they refused outside assistance for so long.",

A report from the Industrial Society will say that the Government's obsession with workplace concessions for mothers, unmatched by benefits for fathers, is forcing companies to avoid employing women altogether wherever possible.</p> <p>'Family-friendly has come to mean mother-friendly under this Government,' said the Industrial Society's Richard Reeves. 'It has further reinforced the divide between men, who are seen not to have family responsibilities, and women, who are seen as having them.'</p> <p>Mothers versus Men, to be published on Wednesday, will say that employment discrimination against women now makes more managerial and economic sense than ever before.</p> <p>Since Labour was elected in 1997, a catalogue of policies has been promised to help working mothers. Maternity leave is soon expected to rise to one year from 44 weeks, some of which is paid. The IS believes that longer leave for mothers without a similar concession for fathers will make it even less attractive for companies to employ women.</p> <p>Since last December, both men and women are also entitled to take up to 13 weeks' leave in the first five years of a child's life. That change was introduced by European directive, not by Whitehall.</p> <p>'At least the political Right who argue that women earn less because they have children have an intellectually coherent argument,' said Reeves. 'The Government is peddling a fiction that women can be mothers at work competing equally with men.'</p> <p>The report will be accompanied by a survey showing that women with childcare responsibilities are treated much more sympathetically by employers, who expect them to take time off. But the price of tolerance is often lower pay and less training. Men who need to look after a sick child are likely to ring in sick themselves rather than admit that they have problems at home.</p> <p>'Women are becoming intrinsically disadvantaged at work because of the role they are expected to perform as mothers,' said Reeves. 'Men should be expected to take time off too.'</p> <p>The IS will say that the only way to redress the balance is to provide equal treatment for parents regardless of sex. However, the cost of partly paid paternity leave for millions of fathers would almost certainly be opposed by the Treasury.</p> <p>'If we are serious as a society about equality,' said Reeves, 'then we have to address the difference between the ability of mothers and fathers to compete in the workplace. The Government is taking an untenable position when it simultaneously calls for pound-for-pound gender equality in the workplace and in the next breath further cements women into a unique role as primary carers of children. It doesn't add up.'</p> <p>Tony Blair's 'macho' decision not to take time off work for the birth of his new baby Leo last May will also attract criticism.</p> <p>'The Prime Minister was presented with an ideal opportunity to send a clear message about the importance of fatherhood in terms of spending time with chil dren rather than just bringing in the money,' said Reeves.</p> <p>'When he became a father again he said that being Prime Minister was \"the kind of job\" which prevented him having time off. The problem is that lots of men feel like that about their job and the simple truth is that there's no more important job than being a parent.'</p> <p>A Labour spokesman insisted: 'Our policies are the product of an extensive \"Listening to Women\" campaign. Everyone who is trying to help women reach equality recognises that it's not a smooth process.'</p> <p>Ministers for Women, Baroness Jay and Tessa Jowell, are responsible for championing family policy in Whitehall. They have already been embarrassed twice this year, after promoting Tony Blair's humiliating appearance before the Women's Institute conference and after backing a summit on female body image which produced a crop of unflattering headlines.</p> <p>The Industrial Society was founded 80 years ago to promote better workplace practice. Its first major campaign was to secure the provision of lavatories in factories. It provides training and advice to many of Britain's leading companies.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:ben.summerskill@observer.co.uk\">ben.summerskill@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

Mothers versus Men, to be published on Wednesday, will say that employment discrimination against women now makes more managerial and economic sense than ever before. Since Labour was elected in 1997, a catalogue of policies has been promised to help working mothers. Maternity leave is soon expected to rise to one year from 44 weeks, some of which is paid. The IS believes that longer leave for mothers without a similar concession for fathers will make it even less attractive for companies to employ women. Since last December, both men and women are also entitled to take up to 13 weeks' leave in the first five years of a child's life. That change was introduced by European directive, not by Whitehall. 'At least the political Right who argue that women earn less because they have children have an intellectually coherent argument,' said Reeves. 'The Government is peddling a fiction that women can be mothers at work competing equally with men.' The report will be accompanied by a survey showing that women with childcare responsibilities are treated much more sympathetically by employers, who expect them to take time off. But the price of tolerance is often lower pay and less training. Men who need to look after a sick child are likely to ring in sick themselves rather than admit that they have problems at home. 'Women are becoming intrinsically disadvantaged at work because of the role they are expected to perform as mothers,' said Reeves. 'Men should be expected to take time off too.' The IS will say that the only way to redress the balance is to provide equal treatment for parents regardless of sex. However, the cost of partly paid paternity leave for millions of fathers would almost certainly be opposed by the Treasury. 'If we are serious as a society about equality,' said Reeves, 'then we have to address the difference between the ability of mothers and fathers to compete in the workplace. The Government is taking an untenable position when it simultaneously calls for pound-for-pound gender equality in the workplace and in the next breath further cements women into a unique role as primary carers of children. It doesn't add up.' Tony Blair's 'macho' decision not to take time off work for the birth of his new baby Leo last May will also attract criticism. 'The Prime Minister was presented with an ideal opportunity to send a clear message about the importance of fatherhood in terms of spending time with chil dren rather than just bringing in the money,' said Reeves. 'When he became a father again he said that being Prime Minister was \"the kind of job\" which prevented him having time off. The problem is that lots of men feel like that about their job and the simple truth is that there's no more important job than being a parent.' A Labour spokesman insisted: 'Our policies are the product of an extensive \"Listening to Women\" campaign. Everyone who is trying to help women reach equality recognises that it's not a smooth process.' Ministers for Women, Baroness Jay and Tessa Jowell, are responsible for championing family policy in Whitehall. They have already been embarrassed twice this year, after promoting Tony Blair's humiliating appearance before the Women's Institute conference and after backing a summit on female body image which produced a crop of unflattering headlines. The Industrial Society was founded 80 years ago to promote better workplace practice. Its first major campaign was to secure the provision of lavatories in factories. It provides training and advice to many of Britain's leading companies. ben.summerskill@observer.co.uk",

      "bodyText": "A spectre is haunting the Catholics of North Belfast - the spectre of Johnny 'Mad Dog' Adair. The muscular, shaven-headed, heavily tattooed Shankill Road loyalist is spotted everywhere along Belfast's so-called peacelines - a series of Berlin-style walls that separate Protestant and Catholic communities in this most dangerous part of Northern Ireland. Catholic residents living in areas such as the Lower Cliftonville Road are seized with panic every time a stranger with a shaved head is seen in a car cruising their streets. Adair, whose unit of the Ulster Defence Association has been behind the recent wave of sectarian attacks on Catholic homes in the city, has engendered a collective paranoia within the nationalist population. Rumours fly that he has been spotted in this district or that. Vigilante patrols and community watch groups have even been set up to look out for signs of loyalist incursions from UDA strongholds across the peaceline. In parts of north Belfast in particular, it is hard to believe there is even such as a thing as a peace process. Anne Marie O'Dwyer lives just yards away from one of the barriers between the Catholic Cliftonville and the loyalist Lower Oldpark, the latter being the area where Adair grew up. The mother of six, who lost both her mother and brother in the Troubles, had only moved into her new home in May. Now she is contemplating leaving the house for fear of further sectarian attacks instigated by the UDA. In the early hours of last Tuesday, Mrs O'Dwyer was woken by what she thought were fireworks: 'I heard these loud bangs around 4am and I looked out. There was a car speeding off from the front of my neighbours' house with four men in. At first I thought it was joyriders, but then when I went outside I realised that someone had fired shots into the neighbours' house. The windows were smashed and there were bullet cases on the road,' she said. In 1976, Mrs O'Dwyer's mother, Sarah, was killed in a loyalist bomb attack, and eight years ago her brother, Michael, was shot dead by a rogue policeman who went berserk inside Sinn Fein's Belfast headquarters killing two other men. Mrs O'Dwyer thought her own 'personal Troubles' were finally over with the ceasefire. Now she is not so sure: 'It's like being dragged back into the past again. I am scared. Some of my children's bedrooms look onto the peaceline and they have been sleeping on mattresses in my room, because they're afraid the loyalists will fire into their rooms.' The gun attack on the O'Dwyers' neighbours came just hours after Johnny Adair alleged that the IRA had tried to kill him in a pipe-bomb attack. However, Sinn Fein, the RUC, rival loyalists in the Ulster Volunteer Force, and even some of Adair's own comrades in the UDA, believe the 'attack' was a ploy to provide an excuse for anti-ceasefire loyalists to return to war on north Belfast's streets - an area which recorded a fifth of all deaths in the Troubles. Mrs O'Dwyer and other residents of this growing Catholic enclave are threatening to leave en masse unless their homes can be secured. According to Manus Maguire, a community worker in Lower Cliftonville trying desperately to build links with Protestant groups across the peaceline, 14 families who are about to move into newly constructed houses are also having second thoughts. 'They have told me that unless the housing association, Oaklee, fits the homes with bulletproof windows, steel fortified gates, drop bars on the doors, and panic buttons, they won't move in,' Maguire said. Even with vigilante groups keeping a round-the-clock watch on Clifton Park Avenue, there is palpable fear on the wide streets that end abruptly at the peaceline. Violence often flares on these interfaces during Ulster's marching season, but this summer's disturbances have taken a more menacing turn. It started a fortnight ago when Protestant homes in south, west and north Belfast came under co-ordinated attack. Sinn Fein denied that republicans were involved in any of the incidents. Republicans claim that loyalists stage-managed many of the forays into Protestant areas in order to foment sectarian clashes and provide an opportunity for the UDA to portray itself as the defender of the loyalist people. Standing at the end of Rosevale Street, which ends at the peaceline in front of Lower Oldpark, Maguire said the recent violence was not just a battle for supremacy within loyalism. 'It's certainly true that the trouble has only been in interfaces where nationalist areas look onto loyalist areas which are UDA strongholds,' he said. 'But there is another underlying reason for the trouble - many loyalists feel under territorial threat from nationalists in north Belfast. The Catholic population is growing here and the loyalist population is declining, what was once a Protestant stronghold is changing, and they don't like it,' he said. Adair's supporters have already tried to reclaim parts of north Belfast, which many Protestants perceive to be falling into Catholic hands.

The INLA's political wing, the Irish Republican Socialist Party, opposes the Good Friday agreement and is trying to make capital out of the recent disturbances, arguing that the deal has not brought peace to the working-class nationalists in places like north Belfast. The IRSP's Paul Little, who lives in the Lower Cliftonville area and works with the community scheme keeping watch on the peaceline, claims the British Government is turning a blind eye to the Shankill Road UDA's 'war mongering.' 'If the INLA was to break its ceasefire in the way the UDA has by shooting up Catholic houses, our prisoners' feet would not touch the ground on their way back to the Maze,' he says.

      "body": "<p>Every morning for the last week, Admiral Vyacheslav Alexeyevich Popov has paced the bridge of the Peter the Great, the nuclear-powered Kirov-class cruiser which is the flagship of the Russian Northern Fleet. Every morning the view has been the same.</p> <p>As the dim Arctic night has lifted, he has seen the same ships rolling with the heavy swell of the Barents Sea, felt the wind tugging at his gold-braided peaked cap and watched the same men send the same inadequate machines into the frigid waters. Three hundred and fifty-seven feet below, on the ocean floor, lies submarine K-141, the Kursk: a 500ft, 14,000- tonne, double-hulled Oscar-II class submarine. On board are an undisclosed number of torpedoes and missiles (each with 1,000lb warheads), two nuclear reactors (each capable of producing as much power as one of the smaller British power stations) and, almost certainly now, the corpses of 118 men.</p> <p>Nine days ago, 45 year-old Gennady Lyachev, the captain of the Kursk, was relaxing in his quarters at the submarine base of Vidyayevo. For a week his crew had been waiting. Now, finally, they had been given the go-ahead.</p> <p>At about 8.30am on Saturday morning, he took the Kursk north down the wide Kola inlet to join the rest of the famed Northern Fleet 50 miles out in the shallow Barents Sea. By 10am it was in position. Around the sub, 33 warships checked and turned and tested their weapons systems under a blank sky.</p> <p>Twelve miles away from the Kursk's position, a Norwegian intelligence vessel, the Marjata, was rolling with the heavy swell. Two American submarines, out playing the Cold War game of Arctic cat-and-mouse with the Russian fleet, were also close by. The Northern Fleet's summer manoeuvres allow the West to judge the capabilities of the Russian navy. But after days of observation nothing of real interest had turned up.</p> <p>At 10.31am on Saturday, something did. Listening devices on the Marjata picked up a muffled explosion. Analysts took it to be a depth charge. But 2 minutes 11 seconds later came a far bigger blast. Even the USS Loyal, an American acoustic data-gathering vessel 250 miles away, heard it. Within an hour the observers noticed the Northern Fleet's deployment change radically. Something dreadful had happened.</p> <p>We know that at 10.29 the Kursk was engaged in a weapons-firing exercise with the rest of the fleet. It would have been at 'periscope depth' - around 100ft. The Kursk has six torpedo tubes in its bows and silos for 12 more missiles - probably SS-N19 'Shipwrecks' with a range of 300 miles - stored along its sides.</p> <p>When it was the submarine's turn to loose one of these formidable weapons, Captain Lyachin would have given the order to fire and waited for the shuddering roar of the outgoing projectile and the reports of his gunners. But it seems that one of the missiles prematurely detonated while firing. Some think it was an SS-N19 in a vertical launcher. Others say it was probably an SS-N16 'Stallion' fired from a torpedo tube in the bows.</p> <p>The explosion blasted a massive hole on the right side of the bows of the sub. The Kursk would have twisted and bucked under the blast and then lurched sickeningly down and to the right as the water jetted in through the torn hull. Anyone in the forwardmost of the sub's 10 bulkheads who had survived the explosion would have been smashed unconscious by the blasting sea and killed almost instantly. They wouldn't even have known they were drowning.</p> <p>In the control room, Lyachin had only a few seconds to react. He would have issued three or four terse orders. 'It's not like the films,' said Richard Sharpe, editor of Jane's Fighting Ships and a former nuclear submarine captain. 'Submarine captains don't shout.'</p> <p>First, the captain would have ordered the Kursk's ballast tanks to be 'blown' or filled with air to boost the ailing sub's buoyancy. As forward movement also keeps a crippled sub afloat, he would also have ordered the reactors to be cranked up to generate maximum speed. Then, if he had time, he would have paused to take stock.</p> <p>However, he almost certainly did not have time. Even if sailors in the forward bulkheads moved fast enough to shut the water-tight doors the enormous pressure of the water would have simply blasted them open again. Hundreds of tonnes of freezing cold water would been jetting into Lyachin's control room before any emergency procedures could be activated. The veteran seaman simply had no chance to save his ship. Within seconds he was going down with it.</p> <p>With its forward third full of water, the Kursk tipped downwards and headed for the seabed. The explosion ruptured the right ballast tank and the imbalance would have given the sub the 12 to 20 degrees list that Russian officials have reported.</p> <p>A submarine under control would take 95 seconds under normal conditions to dive 350ft. The Kursk, with its 50,000-horsepower reactors driving it down nose first, would have taken less than half that time. Two minutes and 15 seconds after the first explosion, the Norwegian listeners aboard the Marjata recorded a second explosion, far bigger than the first. It was, they said, the equivalent of around two tonnes of high-explosive and measured 3.5 on the Richter scale. It blew out the whole of the front right section of the sub, buckling its hull as far back as the conning tower. By the time of the second blast - almost certainly other munitions going off - the vessel was probably on the ocean floor. No mayday had been sent, no emergency beacons released, no flares sent to the surface. It had all happened too fast.</p> <p>Every ship in the Northern Fleet must have known something terrible had happened. At 11.30am the submarine failed to make a pre-arranged radio contact. Nearly 14 hours later, at 3.21am, the operator of a sonic depth finder on board the Peter the Great informed Admiral Popov that he had registered an 'abnormality' on the seabed. It was the Kursk.</p> <p>Six hours later the first specialist rescue ships were in place above the stricken submarine. For a day the story was kept from the press. Then it leaked. When the questions started coming at them, the navy spokesmen stalled. They were in touch with the crew, they said. There was air and power on board the sub. They were 'confident of a positive outcome'.</p> <p>The truth was very different. When, on Sunday morning, President Putin asked Defence Minister Igor Sergeyev what chance they had of saving the crew, he got a blunt answer. 'Extremely small,' Sergeyev said.</p> <p>From Sunday to Thursday last week a fierce storm battered the Barents Sea. The Kolokol-class diving bells that were the first option of the rescuers were useless as their motherships rolled up and down with the swell. Making a connection to the Kursk's rear escape hatch proved impossible.</p> <p>Instead three mini-submarines were deployed. But though the craft dived round the clock, thick clouds of silt and strong currents made it impossible to find the hatch, let alone connect to it. When - on Friday morning - one of the subs did connect, the crew found that the hatch was so misshapen that an airtight connection was impossible.</p> <p>Now rescue hopes depend on a British state-of-the-art 'Slingsby LP5' mini-sub that is on a private exclusive contract to the Royal Navy. It was only on Wednesday, when Putin finally gave permission for the rescuers to accept Western offers of help, that the sub, its crew and support team were flown in an Antonov cargo plane from Scotland to Trondheim in Norway. From there they have been making their way on a Norwegian ship towards the Barents Sea. For the sailors and their relatives, the LP5 is the last hope.</p> <p>The contrast between the grim 'secret cities' of the north and Sochi's Bocharov Ruchei, the sumptuous sprawling complex by the Black Sea converted into a presidential retreat by Boris Yeltsin, could not be greater.

      "bodyText": "Every morning for the last week, Admiral Vyacheslav Alexeyevich Popov has paced the bridge of the Peter the Great, the nuclear-powered Kirov-class cruiser which is the flagship of the Russian Northern Fleet. Every morning the view has been the same. As the dim Arctic night has lifted, he has seen the same ships rolling with the heavy swell of the Barents Sea, felt the wind tugging at his gold-braided peaked cap and watched the same men send the same inadequate machines into the frigid waters. Three hundred and fifty-seven feet below, on the ocean floor, lies submarine K-141, the Kursk: a 500ft, 14,000- tonne, double-hulled Oscar-II class submarine. On board are an undisclosed number of torpedoes and missiles (each with 1,000lb warheads), two nuclear reactors (each capable of producing as much power as one of the smaller British power stations) and, almost certainly now, the corpses of 118 men. Nine days ago, 45 year-old Gennady Lyachev, the captain of the Kursk, was relaxing in his quarters at the submarine base of Vidyayevo. For a week his crew had been waiting. Now, finally, they had been given the go-ahead. At about 8.30am on Saturday morning, he took the Kursk north down the wide Kola inlet to join the rest of the famed Northern Fleet 50 miles out in the shallow Barents Sea. By 10am it was in position. Around the sub, 33 warships checked and turned and tested their weapons systems under a blank sky. Twelve miles away from the Kursk's position, a Norwegian intelligence vessel, the Marjata, was rolling with the heavy swell. Two American submarines, out playing the Cold War game of Arctic cat-and-mouse with the Russian fleet, were also close by. The Northern Fleet's summer manoeuvres allow the West to judge the capabilities of the Russian navy. But after days of observation nothing of real interest had turned up. At 10.31am on Saturday, something did. Listening devices on the Marjata picked up a muffled explosion. Analysts took it to be a depth charge. But 2 minutes 11 seconds later came a far bigger blast. Even the USS Loyal, an American acoustic data-gathering vessel 250 miles away, heard it. Within an hour the observers noticed the Northern Fleet's deployment change radically. Something dreadful had happened. We know that at 10.29 the Kursk was engaged in a weapons-firing exercise with the rest of the fleet. It would have been at 'periscope depth' - around 100ft. The Kursk has six torpedo tubes in its bows and silos for 12 more missiles - probably SS-N19 'Shipwrecks' with a range of 300 miles - stored along its sides. When it was the submarine's turn to loose one of these formidable weapons, Captain Lyachin would have given the order to fire and waited for the shuddering roar of the outgoing projectile and the reports of his gunners. But it seems that one of the missiles prematurely detonated while firing. Some think it was an SS-N19 in a vertical launcher. Others say it was probably an SS-N16 'Stallion' fired from a torpedo tube in the bows. The explosion blasted a massive hole on the right side of the bows of the sub. The Kursk would have twisted and bucked under the blast and then lurched sickeningly down and to the right as the water jetted in through the torn hull. Anyone in the forwardmost of the sub's 10 bulkheads who had survived the explosion would have been smashed unconscious by the blasting sea and killed almost instantly. They wouldn't even have known they were drowning. In the control room, Lyachin had only a few seconds to react. He would have issued three or four terse orders. 'It's not like the films,' said Richard Sharpe, editor of Jane's Fighting Ships and a former nuclear submarine captain. 'Submarine captains don't shout.' First, the captain would have ordered the Kursk's ballast tanks to be 'blown' or filled with air to boost the ailing sub's buoyancy. As forward movement also keeps a crippled sub afloat, he would also have ordered the reactors to be cranked up to generate maximum speed. Then, if he had time, he would have paused to take stock. However, he almost certainly did not have time. Even if sailors in the forward bulkheads moved fast enough to shut the water-tight doors the enormous pressure of the water would have simply blasted them open again. Hundreds of tonnes of freezing cold water would been jetting into Lyachin's control room before any emergency procedures could be activated. The veteran seaman simply had no chance to save his ship. Within seconds he was going down with it. With its forward third full of water, the Kursk tipped downwards and headed for the seabed. The explosion ruptured the right ballast tank and the imbalance would have given the sub the 12 to 20 degrees list that Russian officials have reported. A submarine under control would take 95 seconds under normal conditions to dive 350ft. The Kursk, with its 50,000-horsepower reactors driving it down nose first, would have taken less than half that time. Two minutes and 15 seconds after the first explosion, the Norwegian listeners aboard the Marjata recorded a second explosion, far bigger than the first.

      "body": "<p>As Jim Wallace steps back from the front line after his stint as leader of Scotland's ruling coalition, he is bullish about a Parliament that so far has had an unenthusiastic press and seems to have left the Scottish public distinctly underwhelmed.</p> <p>The Deputy First Minister and Justice Minister is unabashed. He says that from 'a standing start' the Parliament has posted a solid list of achievements.</p> <p>He claims its flexibility, speed of response and working methods have shown Westminster how a modern legislature should conduct its business and left his party, the Lib Dems, in a strong position to contest the next election.</p> <p>Wallace, 46 next Friday, is generally reckoned to have performed well as stand-in for Donald Dewar while the First Minister was off recovering from heart surgery.</p> <p>He has found the period 'challenging'. He explains: 'When Donald first told me, my immediate reaction was that this wasn't part of the script. He quite bluntly said: \"Deputies are there to deputise\".'</p> <p>Wallace had already survived a difficult start. There were sneers that in forming the coalition with Labour he traded principle for a 'ministerial Mondeo'. As Justice Minister, he had to produce emergency legislation to deal with the case of Noel Ruddle, a psychopath released from Carstairs because of a legal loophole.</p> <p>His department has had to respond to the challenges flowing from the European Convention on Human Rights, binding on the Scottish Executive and Parliament from the start.</p> <p>And in April it seemed to observers that Wallace's Labour partners had cynically used him as scapegoat and flak-taker when the coalition abandoned its outright opposition to the Bill, sponsored by Tommy Sheridan and others, to abolish warrant sales, a method of debt enforcement which all parties agree is barbaric and outdated.</p> <p>Wallace, who set out the Executive's position in his opening speech and then found the ground shifting beneath his feet, says he knew that negotiations were going on but that he was 'holding the line'. He explains: 'It looked dramatic, and I'm not pretending it felt comfortable. But in the end of the day what divided us was not a huge issue of principle.'</p> <p>The Executive agrees the system can be harsh and oppressive against people who cannot pay, but is determined not to let 'people who can pay but choose not to' off the hook.</p> <p>The Executive will bring forward its own legislation to replace the warrant-sale system 'within this Parliament'. This is likely to be based on the Scottish Law Commission's report, which in April suggested restricting the circumstances and scope of warrant sales, and reflects the work of a review committee of which Sheridan is a member.</p> <p>Wallace's department has also carried a thorough audit of the impact of the convention and will bring forward legislation in the autumn. He says: 'I'm someone who's campaigned for most of the time I've been in politics to bring the convention into British domestic law. I can see the irony - I never thought I'd be the Minister it would first bite.</p> <p>'But I don't apologise. If you look at the principles of the convention - fairness of trial, right of assembly, right of privacy and so on - they are principles that most people would sign up to. Many of these rights were in the old common law but have been eroded by statute, and can be eroded by statute.'</p> <p>Among the changes flowing from the convention are part-time rather than temporary sheriffs (because the latter did not have security of tenure). 'Yes, we have had disruption. But we will end up with a better system of justice.'</p> <p>He has promised a judicial appointments commission to make the selection of judges beyond reproach.</p> <p>On the Parliament's record, Wallace says with enthusiasm: 'I don't want to look at things through rose-tinted spectacles, but I genuinely think that from a standing start we have made remarkable progress.'</p> <p>MP for Orkney and Shetland since 1983, he is not standing for Westminster next time around. The way they conduct business in Edinburgh, he believes, is 'light years' ahead of Westminster, where he says there is arid point-scoring, procedural delay and the dismissal of good ideas if they come from the wrong quarter.</p> <p>Edinburgh, by contrast, is 'civilised, sensible and modern' and the committee system is developing on genuinely cross-party lines. 'People in Scotland are finding that, if they respond to consultation, their views are taken into account.'</p> <p>It is ironic, he thinks, that Westminster failed to reform Section 28 - because of Tory opposition in the Lords - while Edinburgh has done so. He rejects criticisms that the Executive made a hash of things by failing to consult.</p> <p>Of Stagecoach bus boss Brian Souter, who bankrolled the campaign against reform, he says: 'I respect Brian Souter. I've met him. I think he is sincere in his views. On this particular issue, I disagree with him. What gives me cause for considerable unease is if we were increasingly to find we were living in a country where the whole political debate and issues were determined by people with money.'</p> <p>He claims, as a central achievement of his party's involvement in the coalition, the 'abolition' of student tuition fees. He rejects the notion that the fees haven't been abolished at all, simply deferred.</p> <p>Lying somewhere ahead is the question of proportional representation in local government. Because of growing opposition in the Labour Party, there are doubts whether Dewar can deliver - it is estimated that almost 80 per cent of Labour councillors are against it. Is it a coalition-busting issue? Wallace is cool. In countries accustomed to coalitions, 'coalition-busting issues come up every few weeks'.</p> <p>He explains: 'It's an important issue, though it doesn't necessarily grab the public.' But he says the principle is important for reinvigorating local government, giving it 'parity of esteem' with a fairly elected Parliament. The position in Glasgow, where there is a huge entrenched Labour majority, 'is not just sustainable'.</p> <p>The partnership agreement was that the coalition would 'make progress' on the McIntosh Commission's unanimous recommendation that there should be PR in time for the next council elections. A subsequent report by a committee chaired by the academic Richard Kerley recommended the single transferable vote.</p> <p>'We've set up a ministerial working group to carry forward the Kerley proposals. We know what is in the partnership agreement. Equally, we're sensitive to the views that exist within the Labour Party.' He adds: 'There's no point in forcing the pace today if you're going to lose.

      "bodyText": "As Jim Wallace steps back from the front line after his stint as leader of Scotland's ruling coalition, he is bullish about a Parliament that so far has had an unenthusiastic press and seems to have left the Scottish public distinctly underwhelmed. The Deputy First Minister and Justice Minister is unabashed. He says that from 'a standing start' the Parliament has posted a solid list of achievements. He claims its flexibility, speed of response and working methods have shown Westminster how a modern legislature should conduct its business and left his party, the Lib Dems, in a strong position to contest the next election. Wallace, 46 next Friday, is generally reckoned to have performed well as stand-in for Donald Dewar while the First Minister was off recovering from heart surgery. He has found the period 'challenging'. He explains: 'When Donald first told me, my immediate reaction was that this wasn't part of the script. He quite bluntly said: \"Deputies are there to deputise\".' Wallace had already survived a difficult start. There were sneers that in forming the coalition with Labour he traded principle for a 'ministerial Mondeo'. As Justice Minister, he had to produce emergency legislation to deal with the case of Noel Ruddle, a psychopath released from Carstairs because of a legal loophole. His department has had to respond to the challenges flowing from the European Convention on Human Rights, binding on the Scottish Executive and Parliament from the start. And in April it seemed to observers that Wallace's Labour partners had cynically used him as scapegoat and flak-taker when the coalition abandoned its outright opposition to the Bill, sponsored by Tommy Sheridan and others, to abolish warrant sales, a method of debt enforcement which all parties agree is barbaric and outdated. Wallace, who set out the Executive's position in his opening speech and then found the ground shifting beneath his feet, says he knew that negotiations were going on but that he was 'holding the line'. He explains: 'It looked dramatic, and I'm not pretending it felt comfortable. But in the end of the day what divided us was not a huge issue of principle.' The Executive agrees the system can be harsh and oppressive against people who cannot pay, but is determined not to let 'people who can pay but choose not to' off the hook. The Executive will bring forward its own legislation to replace the warrant-sale system 'within this Parliament'. This is likely to be based on the Scottish Law Commission's report, which in April suggested restricting the circumstances and scope of warrant sales, and reflects the work of a review committee of which Sheridan is a member. Wallace's department has also carried a thorough audit of the impact of the convention and will bring forward legislation in the autumn. He says: 'I'm someone who's campaigned for most of the time I've been in politics to bring the convention into British domestic law. I can see the irony - I never thought I'd be the Minister it would first bite. 'But I don't apologise. If you look at the principles of the convention - fairness of trial, right of assembly, right of privacy and so on - they are principles that most people would sign up to. Many of these rights were in the old common law but have been eroded by statute, and can be eroded by statute.' Among the changes flowing from the convention are part-time rather than temporary sheriffs (because the latter did not have security of tenure). 'Yes, we have had disruption. But we will end up with a better system of justice.' He has promised a judicial appointments commission to make the selection of judges beyond reproach. On the Parliament's record, Wallace says with enthusiasm: 'I don't want to look at things through rose-tinted spectacles, but I genuinely think that from a standing start we have made remarkable progress.' MP for Orkney and Shetland since 1983, he is not standing for Westminster next time around. The way they conduct business in Edinburgh, he believes, is 'light years' ahead of Westminster, where he says there is arid point-scoring, procedural delay and the dismissal of good ideas if they come from the wrong quarter. Edinburgh, by contrast, is 'civilised, sensible and modern' and the committee system is developing on genuinely cross-party lines. 'People in Scotland are finding that, if they respond to consultation, their views are taken into account.' It is ironic, he thinks, that Westminster failed to reform Section 28 - because of Tory opposition in the Lords - while Edinburgh has done so. He rejects criticisms that the Executive made a hash of things by failing to consult. Of Stagecoach bus boss Brian Souter, who bankrolled the campaign against reform, he says: 'I respect Brian Souter. I've met him. I think he is sincere in his views. On this particular issue, I disagree with him. What gives me cause for considerable unease is if we were increasingly to find we were living in a country where the whole political debate and issues were determined by people with money.' He claims, as a central achievement of his party's involvement in the coalition, the 'abolition' of student tuition fees. He rejects the notion that the fees haven't been abolished at all, simply deferred. Lying somewhere ahead is the question of proportional representation in local government. Because of growing opposition in the Labour Party, there are doubts whether Dewar can deliver - it is estimated that almost 80 per cent of Labour councillors are against it. Is it a coalition-busting issue? Wallace is cool. In countries accustomed to coalitions, 'coalition-busting issues come up every few weeks'. He explains: 'It's an important issue, though it doesn't necessarily grab the public.' But he says the principle is important for reinvigorating local government, giving it 'parity of esteem' with a fairly elected Parliament. The position in Glasgow, where there is a huge entrenched Labour majority, 'is not just sustainable'. The partnership agreement was that the coalition would 'make progress' on the McIntosh Commission's unanimous recommendation that there should be PR in time for the next council elections. A subsequent report by a committee chaired by the academic Richard Kerley recommended the single transferable vote. 'We've set up a ministerial working group to carry forward the Kerley proposals. We know what is in the partnership agreement. Equally, we're sensitive to the views that exist within the Labour Party.' He adds: 'There's no point in forcing the pace today if you're going to lose. You're better to wait for the day after tomorrow and winning.' Is it fair to ask turkeys to vote for Christmas? 'I'm sure that's how a number of Labour councillors see it. We would say there's a much bigger goal to be won - reinvigorating Scottish local democracy. That will not happen under the present electoral system. I hope that, in the broader interests of local democracy, the majority of Labour councillors can be won round.' It is in Wallace's interest to praise the achievement of the Parliament. The Lib Dems went into the coalition promising to make a difference. The party will want to show, come election time, that it has done so. Wallace is even now working on the script.",

But there's little doubt that one day, if all goes as planned, the world will look back to where it began, the day we started to learn to re-grow our own bodies, and we'll be looking with some awe at Professor Liam Donaldson, Britain's ridiculously unassuming chief medical officer. </p> <p>Not for the science itself, for which the credit will span decades. It will go to Edwards and Steptoe, who gave us the world's first test-tube baby ; to Campbell and Wilmut at Edinburgh's Roslin Institute, who cloned a sheep and called her Dolly; to Thomson and Shamblott and other Americans who, two years ago, managed to isolate and develop 'stem cells', the adaptable little buggers from embryos that go on to form variously, after some complex genetic cajoling, our spines or brains or nerves or organs. It will also go to yet-unknown scientists who will try to put all the knowledge together and allow us to re-grow our own bodies. </p> <p>But the credit for allowing them to do that, for the vision, will go to Professor Donaldson, 51, who last week, after a year consulting with an expert committee, produced a seminal report, punching a hole in the incredibly taut ethical atmosphere surrounding the issues of both embryos and cloning, by recommending Britain become the first country to legalise a new branch of research. </p> <p>The Government has accepted all the findings, and will allow a free Parliamentary vote at an early opportunity; a number of Tories, church and pro-life groups have already said they will oppose it, but it looks likely to go through. The rest of Europe and America have greeted the announcement with surprise and interest, and may follow soon. </p> <p> Stem Cell Research: Medical Progress with Responsibility isn't the sexiest title for a tract which could change the world; but then again publishers' hearts hardly started galloping when Marx gave them a book called simply Capital. Donaldson and his team recommend, firstly, that British scientists be allowed, under strictly controlled conditions, to begin extracting these magical 'stem cells' from embryos which are a few days old, and study them to find how they go on to develop into our brains or spines or whatever. Secondly, they recommend we allow - again under strict control - 'therapeutic cloning', the creation of human life not through fertilisation of an egg with a sperm but through insertion of a donor nucleus - either from an embryo or, eventually, from an adult patient - into an egg, thus creating a simulacrum, rather than a child, of the original. (Sit up there at the back; it's not that difficult.) The advantages of the latter are two-fold: that embryos can be cloned, thus allowing more stem cell research; and that if this ever bears fruit then adult patients can, briefly, be cloned to allow their own undamaged stem cells to be extracted, 'twitched' into growing into a new heart or brain or nerve cells, then reinserted into the damaged tissue. This could cure Parkinson's Disease, heart disease, spinal injury. It could cure cancer. </p> <p>And eventually, as Donaldson explains gently, sipping his coffee as the rain batters his Whitehall window, they could simply learn how to extract an adult cell, twitch it back to stem-cell babyhood, tell it to grow again properly and put it back in again. </p> <p>This, he says, is 'the Holy Grail'. Not just because of the implications but because it would skirt the huge ethical obstacles around which Donaldson has just negotiated with subtlety, bringing a bedside manner to the boardroom. No embryos would have to be created only to be flushed away ('not the terminology I'd like to be quoted on,' he chides, 'but essentially, yes') after research. No human clones would have to be made. </p> <p>He sighs as I ask whether the criticism has annoyed him. 'There are some misconceptions. We're not talking about cloning whole human beings, the human equivalent of Dolly; it's abhorrent, it's illegal. And we're not growing whole parts of the body; sitting in the lab growing arms and legs and livers. </p> <p>'I understand people having different views on this subject. But I think the use of language such as \"cannibalism\" is very unfortunate, and doesn't help a balanced debate. We're also looking at life that might be saved at the other end of the spectrum.' And that wholly justifies killing it at the start? 'I suppose the straightforward answer to that is that it's already been resolved through proper democratic process.' He means the Warnock committee and the 1990 Act on in vitro research... but what does he himself think? A 14-day-old embryo; is it or is it not life? He pauses, for a long time. </p> <p>'No. Not at that stage, when it's a tiny ball of cells. But that doesn't mean you can do anything with it. You have to accord it respect. But the 14-day rule is a good one, and I don't think it's an area where we'd want to start pushing back the time limit.' </p> <p>He's careful, private; a strong and thoughtful man who's been accused in the past of arrogance and severity - particularly with his (now wholly justified) criticisms of poor doctors - but seems rather affable in the flesh. He tells me, in a rare personal insight, of his time as a young surgeon in the late 60s, trying to cure a child of leukemia at a time when the survival rate was 4 per cent. 'And I remember the mother saying - I want my child to live, not die. Why can't you do that, doctor? And I couldn't. I think of all the diseases the most distressing is cancer.' </p> <p>He seems, however, remarkably dispassionate, as a doctor, about the possibilities of this new research in which he's played such a crucial role; sentences are fraught with caveats, and there's a clinical wind to his words. Where's the excitement? He smiles. </p> <p>'I see myself as principally serving the public. I often have quite difficult tightropes to walk between the medical profession and the Government and as far as I'm concerned the tightrope leads in a straight line to the public; if that from time to time means I upset the medical profession or the Government I'm prepared to do that. So, while I am excited by the potential of this to help people who are suffering, it is not out of unbridled enthusiasm for the development of science in its own right.' He pauses, to formulate a new entry for the book of scientific understatements. 'It is a... a big moment in medical history. It's opening up a new frontier.' </p> <p>I think that's safe enough, even for him. A new frontier. New life; new humans.

      "body": "<p>According to the PR maestro Max Clifford, 'Nasty' Nick Bateman now has the world at his feet: an end-of-the-pier season as a panto villain, lucrative advertising contracts (presumably anything turned down by Vinnie Jones), spicy columns in the lad mags, months of Richard and Judy and the sofas of GMTV, modelling unattractive leather blousons for catalogues... </p> <p>The trivial swill of modern media celebrity beckons, which is just as well because, having given up a career as an insurance underwriter to take his place in the Big Brother house, it doesn't look as though Nick's career game plan ever included a slow, stealthy crawl up through the ranks of corporate middle management. </p> <p>In both his press conference (broadcast live on Sky) and his post-ejection interview with Davina McCall on Friday, Bateman appeared mightily vulnerable and confused. Was he, we wondered, hero or villain? Machiavellian genius or trembling fall-guy? Were those baby blues the eyes of a calculating sociopath or a pathetic naif? Were we seeing the 'real' Nick? </p> <p>Even Nick didn't seem to know. 'If you live by the sword, you die by the sword,' he intoned. And: 'My strategy came into play before I entered the house. It was a gameshow.' </p> <p>But there were flashes of humour too: was he, Davina wondered, a Channel 4 plant? 'No, Channel 5,' he retorted, lightning fast. No doubt about it, he's good at the game. He even talked about donating money to charity: 'Cancer research,' he said, eyes widening. 'I have a friend with cancer.' He wanted us to like him so much it hurt to watch. </p> <p>He is said by Channel 4 insiders to be on an emotional rollercoaster right now, but I doubt he's ever been off it. 'I'm just an ordinary guy,' he claimed. No, you're not, Nick, you're a metaphor for media celebrity meltdown. To borrow Kirsty Young's catchphrase from the new ITV gameshow, The People Versus..., Nick is now the star of a show he's been preparing for all his life. </p> <p>Bateman is said to be holed up in a luxury serviced flat somewhere in London, away from his family but attended by press officers and psychologists - the essential handmaidens for the narcissistic yet self-loathing modern media celebrity. He has also, fascinatingly, sold his soul to the Sun, the paper which campaigned for his eviction. Is it just that they offered the most money, or does Nick have a grasp of irony? </p> <p>On Friday night, as Nichola was evicted from the Big Brother house, there were banners proclaiming 'Bring Back Nick', while the Nick Bateman Appreciation Society website features thousands of supportive emails. We are, one suspects, a mere mouse-click away from the Nick Bateman module in media studies courses. </p> <p>Whatever Nick's fate, one thing is for sure: as far as Channel 4 is concerned Bateman is the best thing since Four Weddings and A Funeral: rivetingly exposed on Thursday night as a liar and a cheat, we now know he attracted an average of 5.5 million schadenfreude addicts - 63 per cent of the available TV audience and the channel's highest viewing figures since it screened Hugh Grant dithering at the altar in 1995. </p> <p>Thursday night's revelations upped docusoap's emotional ante. It was the point where we moved away from the real life-as-light entertainment antics of Driving School, The Cruise or Airport, towards something potentially gladiatorial. When Darren shook his head in disbelief, muttering 'sick... sick' as the full extent of Nick's double-crossing was revealed around the communal table, the collective jangled nerve endings were exposed as never before. The men in general - and Craig in particular - took the betrayal the hardest and attempted to scramble up to the face-saving moral high ground (you've made me look a **** in front of everybody,' he said, pithily), while the girls just looked disappointed, wanted to get things straight: has he really done this to all of us? And I thought we had something special. </p> <p>This was the point where everybody in the house, apart from Nick, fleetingly forgot they were contestants in a cheap game show, and so did we. It was the first sustained piece of emotional honesty the programme has produced. We tuned in in our millions as Nick carried on lying even when confronted with the hard evidence. How far would this man go to justify himself? </p> <p>When he curled up on his bed, humiliated, could we be sure those weren't crocodile tears? And what was Mel doing there comforting him if she wasn't also indulging in a bit of advanced gameplaying herself? </p> <p>Channel 4 pulled the plug after the tears and before we got to see if any blood was going to be shed. Very smart. Here, one felt, the bar was raised on what we - and the broadcasters - are coming to expect, demanding even, from voyeur TV. Real and extreme emotions in which Nick, a gameshow contestant after all, is stripped down and left emotionally naked. Was this pain or pleasure? </p> <p> Big Brother is unarguably brilliant television. The production team have played with the viewers just as skilfully as Nick appeared to manipulate his co-habitees. Within hours of his ejection you could see the editorial focus shift straight on to Mel, the pretty, flirty Scary Spice-alike minx who is, in her own way, as masterful a manipulator as Bateman. </p> <p>Watch her game plan closely during the next week, as the new competitor joins the show. My bet is that Big Brother will ensure she commands the majority of the edited screentime, even as she appears to play it cool. </p> <p> But what about the bigger picture? What does the extraordinary success of Big Brother and its many worldwide versions say about us? To gain some perspective, I watched the Friday night show with a Big Brother virgin: 'This is horrible. Horrible. I hate this,' he said, but we remained glued because there's no doubt the show brings out the car crash voyeur in us all. </p> <p>We might intend to slow down and drive past averting our eyes, but something always makes us turn and stare at the last minute. </p> <p>None the less, there are signs that the 'reality' gameshow format may already be playing itself out. In September Channel 5 is bringing us Jailbreak, a three-week show with \u00a3100,000 at stake and 24-hour live coverage via the net. In Holland the show De Bus currently features 11 people sharing an 18-foot bed on the top deck of a bus. In a neat twist, contestants were invited to pay a \u00a31,700 'fare' for the privilege - and the show still attracted 6,000 would-be passengers chasing the 24-hour live coverage on the net and a prize in the region of \u00a3270,000.

      "bodyText": "According to the PR maestro Max Clifford, 'Nasty' Nick Bateman now has the world at his feet: an end-of-the-pier season as a panto villain, lucrative advertising contracts (presumably anything turned down by Vinnie Jones), spicy columns in the lad mags, months of Richard and Judy and the sofas of GMTV, modelling unattractive leather blousons for catalogues... The trivial swill of modern media celebrity beckons, which is just as well because, having given up a career as an insurance underwriter to take his place in the Big Brother house, it doesn't look as though Nick's career game plan ever included a slow, stealthy crawl up through the ranks of corporate middle management. In both his press conference (broadcast live on Sky) and his post-ejection interview with Davina McCall on Friday, Bateman appeared mightily vulnerable and confused. Was he, we wondered, hero or villain? Machiavellian genius or trembling fall-guy? Were those baby blues the eyes of a calculating sociopath or a pathetic naif? Were we seeing the 'real' Nick? Even Nick didn't seem to know. 'If you live by the sword, you die by the sword,' he intoned. And: 'My strategy came into play before I entered the house. It was a gameshow.' But there were flashes of humour too: was he, Davina wondered, a Channel 4 plant? 'No, Channel 5,' he retorted, lightning fast. No doubt about it, he's good at the game. He even talked about donating money to charity: 'Cancer research,' he said, eyes widening. 'I have a friend with cancer.' He wanted us to like him so much it hurt to watch. He is said by Channel 4 insiders to be on an emotional rollercoaster right now, but I doubt he's ever been off it. 'I'm just an ordinary guy,' he claimed. No, you're not, Nick, you're a metaphor for media celebrity meltdown. To borrow Kirsty Young's catchphrase from the new ITV gameshow, The People Versus..., Nick is now the star of a show he's been preparing for all his life. Bateman is said to be holed up in a luxury serviced flat somewhere in London, away from his family but attended by press officers and psychologists - the essential handmaidens for the narcissistic yet self-loathing modern media celebrity. He has also, fascinatingly, sold his soul to the Sun, the paper which campaigned for his eviction. Is it just that they offered the most money, or does Nick have a grasp of irony? On Friday night, as Nichola was evicted from the Big Brother house, there were banners proclaiming 'Bring Back Nick', while the Nick Bateman Appreciation Society website features thousands of supportive emails. We are, one suspects, a mere mouse-click away from the Nick Bateman module in media studies courses. Whatever Nick's fate, one thing is for sure: as far as Channel 4 is concerned Bateman is the best thing since Four Weddings and A Funeral: rivetingly exposed on Thursday night as a liar and a cheat, we now know he attracted an average of 5.5 million schadenfreude addicts - 63 per cent of the available TV audience and the channel's highest viewing figures since it screened Hugh Grant dithering at the altar in 1995. Thursday night's revelations upped docusoap's emotional ante. It was the point where we moved away from the real life-as-light entertainment antics of Driving School, The Cruise or Airport, towards something potentially gladiatorial. When Darren shook his head in disbelief, muttering 'sick... sick' as the full extent of Nick's double-crossing was revealed around the communal table, the collective jangled nerve endings were exposed as never before. The men in general - and Craig in particular - took the betrayal the hardest and attempted to scramble up to the face-saving moral high ground (you've made me look a **** in front of everybody,' he said, pithily), while the girls just looked disappointed, wanted to get things straight: has he really done this to all of us? And I thought we had something special. This was the point where everybody in the house, apart from Nick, fleetingly forgot they were contestants in a cheap game show, and so did we. It was the first sustained piece of emotional honesty the programme has produced. We tuned in in our millions as Nick carried on lying even when confronted with the hard evidence. How far would this man go to justify himself? When he curled up on his bed, humiliated, could we be sure those weren't crocodile tears? And what was Mel doing there comforting him if she wasn't also indulging in a bit of advanced gameplaying herself? Channel 4 pulled the plug after the tears and before we got to see if any blood was going to be shed. Very smart. Here, one felt, the bar was raised on what we - and the broadcasters - are coming to expect, demanding even, from voyeur TV. Real and extreme emotions in which Nick, a gameshow contestant after all, is stripped down and left emotionally naked. Was this pain or pleasure? Big Brother is unarguably brilliant television. The production team have played with the viewers just as skilfully as Nick appeared to manipulate his co-habitees. Within hours of his ejection you could see the editorial focus shift straight on to Mel, the pretty, flirty Scary Spice-alike minx who is, in her own way, as masterful a manipulator as Bateman. Watch her game plan closely during the next week, as the new competitor joins the show. My bet is that Big Brother will ensure she commands the majority of the edited screentime, even as she appears to play it cool. But what about the bigger picture? What does the extraordinary success of Big Brother and its many worldwide versions say about us? To gain some perspective, I watched the Friday night show with a Big Brother virgin: 'This is horrible. Horrible. I hate this,' he said, but we remained glued because there's no doubt the show brings out the car crash voyeur in us all. We might intend to slow down and drive past averting our eyes, but something always makes us turn and stare at the last minute. None the less, there are signs that the 'reality' gameshow format may already be playing itself out. In September Channel 5 is bringing us Jailbreak, a three-week show with \u00a3100,000 at stake and 24-hour live coverage via the net. In Holland the show De Bus currently features 11 people sharing an 18-foot bed on the top deck of a bus. In a neat twist, contestants were invited to pay a \u00a31,700 'fare' for the privilege - and the show still attracted 6,000 would-be passengers chasing the 24-hour live coverage on the net and a prize in the region of \u00a3270,000. 'Taking commercial television to an all-time low,' remarked one Dutch critic. So how low can we go? In the US, CBS is broadcasting Survivor, a cross between Big Brother and Castaway, featuring 16 contestants stranded on an island in the South China seas. Undeterred by the fact that the original Swedish version of the show saw the island's first ejectee committing suicide, the programme's makers are currently pulling in audiences of up to 28 million to see contestants cooking rats ('you just skin them, gut them and put them on a stick. They were pretty good,' said basketball coach Gervase Patterson) and competing for $1 million.

      "body": "<p>Britain's car factories are revving up again after their traditional summer holiday shutdown. But senior figures in the troubled industry are concerned that the last remaining Rover car plant may fall silent by next spring - this time for ever. </p> <p>Rover came back from the brink in May when it was handed over to the West Midlands-based Phoenix consortium after being unceremoniously dumped by its German owner, BMW. </p> <p>But less than four months later there are grave worries in the UK components industry, among seasoned players in British carmaking and in Whitehall that Rover could reach the end of the road within seven months. </p> <p>'The feeling is that Rover's future is very uncertain. There is a very frail enterprise there,' a senior motor industry figure told The Observer last week. </p> <p>Pessimistic or realistic? Those fearing doom give Rover at best 18 months, at worst no longer than next March. </p> <p>Rover chairman John Towers said this weekend he understood the fears, but that they were unfounded - his plans to bring the company back to profit are sound. </p> <p>Experienced observers believe that, if Rover is to have a long-term future, it desperately needs a carmaking partner to help it create a new range of desirable models - but that it could have trouble finding one. </p> <p>As we reveal today, the Government secretly app-roached almost all the leading carmakers last March, when the crisis surrounding the company erupted, in the hope that one of them would be interested in acquiring Rover. Ministers were alarmed that the London venture capital firm Alchemy, which first agreed to take Rover from BMW, would strip the British firm's assets to the bone. They were desperate for a brighter alternative, but were snubbed. </p> <p>This let Phoenix into the gap with a heroic plan by the ex-Rover boss, Towers, to restore the company as a high-volume carmaker, producing at least 200,000 vehicles a year and cutting no more than 1,000 jobs. Now it is understood that Rover has been approached by the Malaysian carmaker Proton, which has already bought Lotus and now wants to establish a volume production base in Europe. </p> <p>Many industry veterans are anxious, however. Jon Moulton, head of Alchemy, blew the issue wide open last week with a speech to the Marketing Society, warning that Rover would be fighting for survival by next March at the latest. </p> <p>It is not surprising that this particular prophet of doom has expressed scepticism after his own bid was thwarted by financial disagreements with BMW and UK political opposition. He walked away from the deal. But concerns similar to Molton's were already being voiced in far more objective quarters before he spoke. </p> <p>John Lawson, auto analyst at stockbroker Salomon Smith Barney, said: 'It is going to be an uphill struggle for Rover. There is still a tremendous concern about the attractiveness of their products, and they will have to work with someone else.' </p> <p>Rover began making medium-sized 25 and 45 cars last week from its Longbridge factory in Birmingham, and will probably build around 35,000 within three months. But it will not produce any more upmarket 75 saloons this year because it has to complete the gargantuan task of transferring the vehicle's production line to Longbridge from Oxford, the modernised plant that BMW kept when it disposed of Rover. </p> <p>The components industry, in particular, is waiting nervously to see whether Rover will stick to its forecast of producing 200,000 cars a year.

      "bodyText": "Britain's car factories are revving up again after their traditional summer holiday shutdown. But senior figures in the troubled industry are concerned that the last remaining Rover car plant may fall silent by next spring - this time for ever. Rover came back from the brink in May when it was handed over to the West Midlands-based Phoenix consortium after being unceremoniously dumped by its German owner, BMW. But less than four months later there are grave worries in the UK components industry, among seasoned players in British carmaking and in Whitehall that Rover could reach the end of the road within seven months. 'The feeling is that Rover's future is very uncertain. There is a very frail enterprise there,' a senior motor industry figure told The Observer last week. Pessimistic or realistic? Those fearing doom give Rover at best 18 months, at worst no longer than next March. Rover chairman John Towers said this weekend he understood the fears, but that they were unfounded - his plans to bring the company back to profit are sound. Experienced observers believe that, if Rover is to have a long-term future, it desperately needs a carmaking partner to help it create a new range of desirable models - but that it could have trouble finding one. As we reveal today, the Government secretly app-roached almost all the leading carmakers last March, when the crisis surrounding the company erupted, in the hope that one of them would be interested in acquiring Rover. Ministers were alarmed that the London venture capital firm Alchemy, which first agreed to take Rover from BMW, would strip the British firm's assets to the bone. They were desperate for a brighter alternative, but were snubbed. This let Phoenix into the gap with a heroic plan by the ex-Rover boss, Towers, to restore the company as a high-volume carmaker, producing at least 200,000 vehicles a year and cutting no more than 1,000 jobs. Now it is understood that Rover has been approached by the Malaysian carmaker Proton, which has already bought Lotus and now wants to establish a volume production base in Europe. Many industry veterans are anxious, however. Jon Moulton, head of Alchemy, blew the issue wide open last week with a speech to the Marketing Society, warning that Rover would be fighting for survival by next March at the latest. It is not surprising that this particular prophet of doom has expressed scepticism after his own bid was thwarted by financial disagreements with BMW and UK political opposition. He walked away from the deal. But concerns similar to Molton's were already being voiced in far more objective quarters before he spoke. John Lawson, auto analyst at stockbroker Salomon Smith Barney, said: 'It is going to be an uphill struggle for Rover. There is still a tremendous concern about the attractiveness of their products, and they will have to work with someone else.' Rover began making medium-sized 25 and 45 cars last week from its Longbridge factory in Birmingham, and will probably build around 35,000 within three months. But it will not produce any more upmarket 75 saloons this year because it has to complete the gargantuan task of transferring the vehicle's production line to Longbridge from Oxford, the modernised plant that BMW kept when it disposed of Rover. The components industry, in particular, is waiting nervously to see whether Rover will stick to its forecast of producing 200,000 cars a year. Some think this unlikely. Rover was handed over cash-rich and free of debt. Towers's dowry from BMW was an estimated 60,000 unsold cars, worth \u00a3600 million. He had interest-free loans of \u00a3275m immediately and \u00a3225m over the next three years, which do not have to be repaid for 50 years. A loan facility of \u00a3200m with a US bank, First Union, helped to clinch the deal. This facility was reportedly arranged as working capital to underwrite the finance deals offered to car buyers. The loans and cars together add up to \u00a31.3bn, and in addition Rover has the sprawling Longbridge site itself and the rights to the Rover, MG and obsolete Austin Healey brand names. Sales of Rovers in the UK soared above 20,000, or 12.5 per cent of the market, in April when BMW cut prices and guaranteed resale values. But since then its market share has slumped to just below 4 per cent. When BMW broke up the group, it sold Rover's world famous off-road vehicles arm, Land Rover, to Ford and kept the Mini brand for itself. There will be no more traditional Minis produced by Rover at Longbridge after next month. BMW plans to build its own, all-new version at the Oxford plant next year.

List prices for 45s and 25s have already been slashed by up to 21 per cent, with new Rovers starting at \u00a39,995. But Towers said last week: 'We are not selling anything at a loss.' The 45 is particularly vulnerable to competition because it is basically an old Honda whose engineering dates from the partnership the Japanese manufacturer had with Rover until BMW bought the UK firm in 1994.

However, the case of the Kursk is very different. Scientists believe that, if the nuclear reactors were not properly shut down, then there is a real chance of a meltdown. The super-heated reactors would then burn their way through the bottom of the sub, releasing molten fuel on to the seabed. Mils Bohmer, a Russian nuclear physicist, said that this would release fission products such as plutonium, caesium and uranium into the Barents Sea's fertile fishing ground. So far, tests of water and air samples gathered by Norwegian vessels near the Kursk and analysed by the Norwegian Nuclear Protection Authority have not shown any abnormal levels of radiation. In many ways the bottom of the sea - particularly an isolated and cold sea such as the Barents - can be seen as the best place for damaged nuclear equipment to be dumped.

Detectives this weekend appealed for help in tracing Fiona Mont, the 30-year-old daughter of a prominent Sussex Tory family who has been on the run since faking her own death in January. But now, say police, a number of sightings have placed her firmly in Europe.</p> <p>Nicknamed 'The Cat' because of her ability to keep ahead of detectives, Mont has proved expert at evading capture. Police say that by using seduction and charm she has become one of the most sophisticated and cunning fugitives they have encountered.</p> <p>Mont faces charges relating to a huge computer fraud she is believed to have masterminded. Police are reluctant to give specific details of her probable location, as they believe friends and former lovers in Britain are keeping her informed of police progress. Her downfall began last September, when Steve Skerrett decided to buy a computer. A detective constable with Sussex police, Skerrett responded to an advertisement in his local paper and found himself sitting in a basement flat in Hove with Mont and her boyfriend, surrounded by boxes of new, branded computers.</p> <p>He arranged to return the next Monday, but in the meantime spoke to a colleague who had been working on a case in which a computer manufacturer had been defrauded of tens of thousands of pounds of machines. A few calls reinforced their suspicions, and Skerrett returned on the Monday with a search warrant. Skerrett said of his first visit to Mont's flat: 'We started talking about our jobs, and I told them I was a policeman. There was no reaction, not even a flicker. Nothing at all. She was ice cool about it. I think, to be honest, she probably found the idea of selling something to me quite amusing. It's all a bit of a game to her.'</p> <p>While on bail charged with fraud in this case, Mont continued to play games, calling Skerrett up at his office and inviting him out for a drink. He declined. Mont's confidence crumbled only when she attended an identification parade and was picked out by witnesses. Fearful of facing trial and possibly prison, she resorted to desperate measures and faked suicide. Her Rover 820 car was found abandoned on the edge of the notorious suicide spot at Beachy Head, near Eastbourne, a week later. Her keys had been left on the edge of the 535ft cliff - it seemed she had thrown herself off.</p> <p>A search-and-rescue operation involving police and members of the Coastguard using helicopters and dozens of boats was launched, but called off after two days when Fiona's mother, Joan, said her daughter had called her. Mont now faces charges of wasting police time and skipping bail, as well as the original fraud allegations.</p> <p>Police now know that, after leaving her car at Beachy Head, Mont fled the country in an aircraft piloted by Graham Hesketh, whose nickname is 'The Baron' and who is wanted by police in connection with a number of offences. It was originally thought the pair used the flight as a ruse to come back to England undetected, but detectives are now convinced they remained in Europe, where they may be engaged in a range of other criminal activities.</p> <p>Mont has also left behind a string of broken hearts. One boyfriend is now in prison near Paris awaiting trial on drugs charges. Another is on bail in the UK. 'She is an extremely clever woman,' said Skerrett. 'She can make herself look like a duchess or a tramp and will use anyone who can be of benefit to her.'</p> <p>For Mont, life on the run is a far cry from her privileged upbringing. Her mother is a prominent local Tory, a former leader of East Sussex County Council and president of the Rottingdean Conservative Association. Her late father, Neville, was a solicitor and former Under Sheriff of East Sussex. Mont was educated at the \u00a36,975-a-year St Mary's School in Brighton, but was expelled because of her delinquent behaviour. Although she has been in and out of trouble with the law ever since, Mont has only two minor convictions and has never been to prison.</p> <p>She frequently uses her background as evidence that she has no need to turn to crime. Mont studied law and worked briefly at a local business centre. Using these skills she has set up companies and is believed to have used accounts which indicate these companies have turnovers in excess of \u00a31 million a year. Police say she used these accounts to apply to various computer companies for lines of credit and order tens of thousands of pounds of goods, which she allegedly sells without ever paying for them. Mont is believed to have pocketed more than \u00a3300,000 in this way in the past year alone.</p> <p>She has allegedly placed dozens of ads in the Yellow Pages for her bogus companies, which have never been paid for. She has legally held passports in a number of different names to disguise her identity. After changing her name by deed poll, she sends off her old passport and applies for one in her new name. As anyone is entitled to change their name as often as they want, no checks are made at the Passport Office to see whether such changes could be used for criminal purposes. She uses a number of aliases, including Frances Montgomery, Alison Miller, Jacqueline Mayhew and Jamina Chadwick.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:tony.thompson@observer.co.uk\"> tony.thompson@observer.co.uk</a></p>",

A few calls reinforced their suspicions, and Skerrett returned on the Monday with a search warrant. Skerrett said of his first visit to Mont's flat: 'We started talking about our jobs, and I told them I was a policeman. There was no reaction, not even a flicker. Nothing at all. She was ice cool about it. I think, to be honest, she probably found the idea of selling something to me quite amusing. It's all a bit of a game to her.' While on bail charged with fraud in this case, Mont continued to play games, calling Skerrett up at his office and inviting him out for a drink. He declined. Mont's confidence crumbled only when she attended an identification parade and was picked out by witnesses. Fearful of facing trial and possibly prison, she resorted to desperate measures and faked suicide. Her Rover 820 car was found abandoned on the edge of the notorious suicide spot at Beachy Head, near Eastbourne, a week later. Her keys had been left on the edge of the 535ft cliff - it seemed she had thrown herself off. A search-and-rescue operation involving police and members of the Coastguard using helicopters and dozens of boats was launched, but called off after two days when Fiona's mother, Joan, said her daughter had called her. Mont now faces charges of wasting police time and skipping bail, as well as the original fraud allegations. Police now know that, after leaving her car at Beachy Head, Mont fled the country in an aircraft piloted by Graham Hesketh, whose nickname is 'The Baron' and who is wanted by police in connection with a number of offences. It was originally thought the pair used the flight as a ruse to come back to England undetected, but detectives are now convinced they remained in Europe, where they may be engaged in a range of other criminal activities. Mont has also left behind a string of broken hearts. One boyfriend is now in prison near Paris awaiting trial on drugs charges. Another is on bail in the UK. 'She is an extremely clever woman,' said Skerrett. 'She can make herself look like a duchess or a tramp and will use anyone who can be of benefit to her.' For Mont, life on the run is a far cry from her privileged upbringing. Her mother is a prominent local Tory, a former leader of East Sussex County Council and president of the Rottingdean Conservative Association. Her late father, Neville, was a solicitor and former Under Sheriff of East Sussex. Mont was educated at the \u00a36,975-a-year St Mary's School in Brighton, but was expelled because of her delinquent behaviour. Although she has been in and out of trouble with the law ever since, Mont has only two minor convictions and has never been to prison. She frequently uses her background as evidence that she has no need to turn to crime. Mont studied law and worked briefly at a local business centre. Using these skills she has set up companies and is believed to have used accounts which indicate these companies have turnovers in excess of \u00a31 million a year. Police say she used these accounts to apply to various computer companies for lines of credit and order tens of thousands of pounds of goods, which she allegedly sells without ever paying for them. Mont is believed to have pocketed more than \u00a3300,000 in this way in the past year alone. She has allegedly placed dozens of ads in the Yellow Pages for her bogus companies, which have never been paid for. She has legally held passports in a number of different names to disguise her identity. After changing her name by deed poll, she sends off her old passport and applies for one in her new name. As anyone is entitled to change their name as often as they want, no checks are made at the Passport Office to see whether such changes could be used for criminal purposes. She uses a number of aliases, including Frances Montgomery, Alison Miller, Jacqueline Mayhew and Jamina Chadwick. tony.thompson@observer.co.uk",

For 800 miles across the wilderness they trekked, from the Yukon in Canada to remotest Alaska, far above the Arctic Circle.</p> <p>When they finally made it to the log cabins of Arctic Village on Friday, their cries of joy and their dancing and singing for a moment drowned out the deep fear that drove them on their odyssey.</p> <p>The 100,000-strong Gwich'in tribe's 'millennium trek' was a desperate plea for survival. One of the last tribes of native Americans to live by subsistence, they fear that they - and the caribou on which they depend - are about to lose a 25-year battle that could end in one last Klondike-like scramble for oil.</p> <p>It is a battle that has pitched Alaska against the rest of America and the Indians and environmentalists against Britain's biggest oil company, BP.</p> <p>The age-old conflict between development and environment has nowhere been so stark as in this fragile corner of the world. Nowhere are man's thirst for oil - and the effects of global warming - having such an impact.</p> <p>The remote Gwich'in community of Arctic Village, 100 miles north of the Arctic Circle and with no access by road, nestles against the southern edge of the vast Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The refuge is the last true wilderness in North America, so abundant in wildlife it has been dubbed America's Serengeti. Here are 20 million acres of soaring snowcapped mountains, marshy coastal plains, Arctic tundra and forests of stunted trees, with no signs of man: no roads nor car parks, no visitor centres nor hiking trails.</p> <p>In the short summers the tundra explodes into vibrant reds and yellows. In winter it is smothered in snow. Visitors talk about a primal landscape that takes them back to a time before man, but to the environmentalists and the Gwich'in, it is the wildlife that makes it unique. It has the only population of Alaskan polar bears that live on land; it has the near-extinct shaggy musk ox, the regal moose, grizzly bears, wolverine and lynx.</p> <p>The refuge is the breeding ground for 150 species of birds that migrate to the US, Asia and South America for the bitter winters, when for three months the sun does not rise and temperatures drop below minus 50 centigrade.</p> <p>Above all, it is the 130,000 caribou which dominate the landscape and on which the Gwich'in depend for much of their food. \"My people have always been known as the caribou people,\" says Sarah James of the Gwich'in steering committee, as caribou steaks sizzle on the stove of her cosy log cabin. \"Without the caribou we are lost.\"</p> <p>A sign in the Arctic Village community hall says of the caribou: \"It's our dance, it's our language, it's everything to us.\"</p> <p>Each year the caribou go on one of the last great mammal migrations on the planet, trekking from 1,000 miles away in Canada, through the 9,000ft Brooks range and swimming precariously across sweeping rivers, to the narrow coastal strip of the refuge.</p> <p>Here, in the calving grounds sacred to the Gwich'in, the caribou fatten up with cotton grass to get them through the Arctic winter and, protected from predators, the cows give birth. But amid the majestic scenery are a few oil seeps, a tell-tale sign of what is underneath: below the feet of the grazing caribou lies enough crude oil to fill up to 16 billion barrels - worth many tens of billions of pounds - and the oil companies are pushing hard to start drilling.</p> <p>Oil is already produced along much of the rest of the Alaskan coast but is starting to dry up. At the Prudhoe Bay field, just along from the refuge, production has fallen from two million barrels a day a decade ago to a million now.</p> <p>The caribou are already having to deal with the effects of climate change. Scientists believe the Arctic is getting warmer up to five times faster than the rest of the Earth. The icepack in the Arctic Ocean is now 40 per cent thinner than it was. The permafrost on the tundra is showing signs of melting. Polar bears, short of food, have lost 10 per cent of their body weight.</p> <p>Warmer winters mean more snow in the mountains, and for the first time this year the caribou did not make it to the coast before calving. According to Don Russell, a biologist with the International Porcupine Caribou Management Board, the unfriendly climate is already taking its toll and caribou numbers are falling.</p> <p>\"This year will be worse. Their migration is no longer coinciding with the fast seasonal changes in vegetation,\" he said. If the numbers of caribou fall much further the Gwich'in may have to cut down the number of animals - 4,000 at present - they allow themselves to hunt.</p> <p>And the momentum to raid the refuge for oil, which will further promote global warming, is building. Americans, driving ever bigger and less fuel efficient cars - they are now back to the same consumption of cars 20 years ago - have been shocked by the price of petrol rising to 30p a litre.</p> <p>Arctic Power, an oil-funded lobby group dedicated to opening up the refuge, says in its public literature: 'Worried about fuel prices? Arctic National Wildlife Refuge equals 30 years of Saudi oil. Industry and government experts recognise the coastal plain of the refuge as the single most promising unexplored region in the US for a major oil and gas discovery.'</p> <p>On the other side of the continent, in Washington, pressure is mounting. President Clinton blocked earlier congressional attempts to open up the refuge but his likely successor, George W.

Last year two Gwich'in - backed by environmental groups - flew to Britain to the company's annual meeting and persuaded 13 per cent of BP's shareholders to support a motion to cut back new off-shore production in the area and spend the money developing alternative sources of energy.</p> <p>Yet BP can count on the support of the majority of Alaskans.

It's dirty money. They're just trying to buy the votes of Alaskans,\" sighs Melanie Duchin of Greenpeace Alaska, which has been campaigning hard against oil developments in the region.</p> <p>Oil has also brought many thousands of well-paid jobs, and Arctic Power promises that opening up the refuge will create up to 700,000 more. With current oil fields drying up, pressure for new jobs is intense. BP's Chappell said simply: \"Our activities are key to the economic well-being of the state.\" Alaska's pro-oil representative Don Young puts it more colourfully: \"If you think billions of barrels of oil will stay in the ground, you're smoking pot.\"</p> <p>A new oil boom would be a disaster to the Gwich'in nation, who are desperately concerned about the effect it will have on the caribou.</p> <p>The Gwich'in have always left the calving grounds alone for fear of disturbing them: a pregnant caribou reacts badly to any disturbance or noise.

All the goals came in the last half an hour, with Ricky Gillies putting the home team ahead, Dundee's Argentine forward Juan Sara equalising with a penalty and Steve McGarry getting the winner. There was some irony about Sara's spot-kick because earlier he had been booked for a penalty-area dive. Indeed, he seemed fortunate to remain on the field when he went to ground again shortly afterwards. One of the best matches of the day was Kilmarnock's 3-2 win over Motherwell, after they had twice been behind. The decisive goal came from Frederic Dindeleux 10 minutes from the end.",

An official government report obtained by The Observer details how since 1978 British governments have made more than 500 transfers of 'civilian' nuclear material to the Ministry of Defence. In 1968 Britain was one of 62 countries which signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), which was aimed at stopping such transfers. Nations with nuclear weapons, such as the UK and the United States, have led international criticism of other countries for trying to develop atomic bombs by using nuclear material from civilian sources. The imposition of international inspectors on Iraq was based on alleged breaches of the NPT. The report, released by the Department of Trade and Industry, describes how in 1992 five tons of low-enriched uranium from British Nuclear Fuels' Capenhurst reactor in Cheshire was used to produce tritium, an important component of nuclear weapons manufactured at Aldermaston in Berkshire. In 1983 almost 100 tons of low-enriched uranium from Capenhurst was used for nuclear weapons material. The report also gives details of a previously undisclosed incident in 1986 when more than 800 grams of weapons-grade plutonium from BNFL's nuclear reprocessing plant at Sellafield in Cumbria was 'inadvertently' sent to another reactor. In addition large amounts of depleted uranium from civilian reactors were used for conventional military purposes in making depleted uranium shells and armour for tanks. Dr David Lowry, an environment consultant who has campaigned for years for the information to be released, said: 'It appears to be a case of one rule for us and another for other countries.' A Department of Trade and Industry spokesman denied Britain had been guilty of any such breach.",

While 'Carbon sinks' are in no way a replacement to reductions of emissions at source, they are a valuable part of an integrated approach. We would also argue that the issues associated with forestry are no more or less complex than those associated with other 'offset' propositions, and that well-managed natural woodland programmes bring the added benefit of encouraging bio-diversity.

      "bodyText": "Britain's most respected independent touring orchestras, opera companies and ballet companies are being undercut and forced out of the market by musicians from eastern Europe. Musicians from the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary and the former Soviet Union undertake intensive tours of Britain while spending as little as possible on travel and accommodation, enabling them to charge Britain's venues thousands of pounds less than domestic artists. The growing number of eastern European musicians entering Britain has prompted the Musicians' Union to ask the Government to introduce legislation forcing all artists arriving from abroad to charge a standard fee so that they cannot undercut indigenous talent. 'We are increasingly concerned about this issue,' said Dennis Scard, general secretary of the Musicians' Union. 'Eastern European musicians are coming here and taking desperately needed work opportunities from our own companies.' Scard believes foreign musicians are often exploited by agents who have charged so little for their services they end up living and travelling in terrible conditions. The Chisinau National Opera of Moldova was criticised by the Performers' Alliance during its recent tour of the UK for performing 40 times during a 44-day visit. The company will be back again from mid-September until the end of November. British artists rarely play more than six dates in a single tour and never perform more than three days in a row without a break. The Polish State Opera of Wroclaw and the National Opera of Rousse, currently touring the UK, have similarly intensive programmes. A leading orchestra from eastern Europe will typically charge around \u00a315,000 for a concert, while a top British orchestra will expect around \u00a328,000. A second-rate eastern European orchestra will charge as little as \u00a38,000 for a single performance. Antony Lewis-Crosby, former chief executive of the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic and now chairman of the Association of British Orchestras study, believes competition from overseas is forcing UK orchestras to spend more on marketing - leaving them either to take money away from the musicians or charge more for tickets, making them even less competitive. 'It's got to the stage where British orchestras can't reduce their prices any more without reducing the quality of their programmes,' said Simon Crookall, director of the Royal Scottish National Orchestra. 'We no longer do engagements in the north of England, for example, because we can't compete with the foreign orchestras they're bringing in.' The Leeds International Series, which books tours in northern England, has employed four orchestras from eastern Europe for its next season and none from Britain.

A report by a Swiss Embassy official based in Tokyo during the war praises the Japanese camps for British PoWs as being well-run, humane and 'kind'. The official applauds the 'sunny, healthy location' of many of the camps and describes one of Japan's senior camp commanders as 'educated, rather refined' and with a 'sympathetic manner'. Camp survivors have reacted angrily to the report, which will fuel criticism of the wartime record of the Swiss, who have been attacked over their role in handling Nazi gold. The report on the camps was sent to the Government by the International Red Cross committee in Geneva in 1943. Before one visit the official, August Kengelbacher, re-ports: 'Lunch and dinner given by the mayor ... Then off to the camps in several cars, the whole party there - tea and cakes first.' After visiting Camp Omine in southern Japan, he declares the camp 'a happy one', adding that prisoners were even allowed to raise poultry and pigs. At Camp Omaha he reports that prisoners were allowed to read the Nippon Times, listen to the radio and play a gramophone. He reports that 'all these camps impressed me favourably, especially in regard to sunny, healthy and pleasant location as well as in respect to the living quarters, food supply and treatment at the hands of the camp authorities'. Last night Arthur Titherington, chairman of the Japanese Labour Camp Survivors' Association, said: 'These descriptions are absolutely reprehensible and are as far from the truth as you can possibly imagine. 'If there was any suspicion that a prisoner had a radio they were executed, let alone getting daily copies of the Nippon Times. As for raising animals for food, most survivors I know were lucky to get three cups of rice a day and many died of starvation.' Last week Titherington led a demonstration outside the Japanese Embassy in London on the 55th anniversary of VJ Day, to demand compensation and an apology. Of the 46,000 PoWs who slaved to build the Burma Railway, 16,000 died after subsisting on one bowl of rice a day.

In a survey of 2,000 people, the mortgage bank found total savings in the first quarter of the year were up 18 per cent on the same period last year, from \u00a312.7bn to \u00a315bn. Abbey says after seeing property prices rocket, people want the safety net provided by savings . They are also worried about interest rates rising. Other factors prompting people to hoard their money during the first quarter were the Isa season, strong wage increases and the saving of annual and Christmas bonuses. The equaliser Coventry Building Society is equalising rates on its Isas and Tessas. It is cutting rates on its Square Deal Isa by 0.2 per cent to 6.85 per cent while the rate paid on its Tessa and follow-up Tessa will be raised to 6.85 per cent. The changes will apply to all customers. Coventry believes savers object to the disparity between the two types of account. Costa mortgage Norwich and Peterborough Building Society is launching a fixed-rate mortgage, at 6.24 per cent for two years, for people who want to set up home on the Costa del Sol. The limited edition mortgage is fixed at 6.24 per cent for two years after which it reverts to the lender's standard Spanish homeloan rate, currently 8 per cent. Up to 65 per cent of the purchase price can be borrowed. Tel: 01733 372 006.",

He believes that such a haven would help players afraid to tackle their addictions to find the courage finally to confront their demons. </p> <p>'I want to provide a safe place, a place of hope and trust,' he told The Observer . 'I think a lot of players are reluctant to come forward because of the stigma attached to the disease and because they think it will damage their careers. This could help. I think managers and clubs might also be more willing to let their players go to a centre like this.' </p> <p>Adams, who is likely to be named as England's new captain to replace Alan Shearer on Thursday, would help patients settle into the rehabilitation clinic by using his own successful battle against alcohol as proof of what can be achieved. He and other players such as Paul Merson, Paul Gascoigne and Stan Collymore have all fought highly public battles against addiction, depression and illness, and some have stayed at the Priory clinic. </p> <p>Adams is aiming to open a 12-bed facility in the next 18 months. Recent negotiations to buy a country house in Essex fell through, and he is again looking for a suitable venue. He will invest his own money in the project and has also received the promise of financial backing from an unnamed wealthy sympathiser. </p> <p>The clinic would be loosely modelled on Crossroads, the rehabilitation centre established in Antigua by rock star Eric Clapton, who battled cocaine and alcohol addiction. Adams believes players would feel comfortable talking to him upon arrival, and then qualified experts would run the clinic on a day-to-day basis. </p> <p>Residents would sleep in four-bed dormitories rather than the single private rooms found in other centres, in a deliberate attempt to combat the isolation which often accompanies addiction. Mobile phones would be banned. Football training would carry on as normal. </p> <p>'There are some very good treatment centres, but I'm not sure some of them understand how and why it is important for players to stay physically fit during their treatment,' Adams said. </p> <p>'A football club might be more keen to let a player go into an environment that is football-related, rather than just suppress the problem or shift the player onto another club.' </p> <p>The centre will have a football pitch in its grounds, a weights and fitness room and an indoor swimming pool. Addiction counsellors would supervise group therapy sessions based on the Twelve Steps practised by Alcoholics Anonymous, while a physiologist would oversee the players' physical conditioning. 'It will be a place for mind, body and soul,' Adams said. </p> <p>Regular attendance at groups such as AA, Narcotics, Gamblers and Overeaters Anonymous would be a condition of attendance. </p> <p>Adams thinks his planned centre could have helped stars such as George Best, Diego Maradona and Gascoigne - and still could. 'I've seen too many players come to the end of their careers before they do anything about their problems,' he said. 'I wish I had got recovery ten years ago.' </p> <p>Patients, who may include other sports stars, would receive counselling on issues raised by wealth and celebrity, which have grown alongside football's booming popularity but which receive little sympathy in society at large. </p> <p>Adams is a changed man from the early days of his football career, when he often went on huge drinking binges with team mates such as Paul Merson.

Not a bit of it. 'A lot of people ask me that if it's [a spread bet] enforceable then why isn't it subject to Capital Gains Tax?' says Stuart Wheeler, head of IG Index, grandfather of spread betting, professional bridge player, and all-round shrewdie. 'But there is no connection between the two. Nor is it likely that the bets will be subject to tax in the future because the idea of making people pay tax on any betting profits is not a popular one and certainly not an election winner.' </p> <p>The absence of CGT has saved Philip Peters, the star of Tuesday's edition of the much-improved Jackpot television series, a quarter of a million or so in tax because in the past five years he made \u00a3600,000 from spread betting. Peters' career has been picaresque. Here is his CV with, admittedly, somewhat sketchy dates: </p> <p><strong> 1958-1963:</strong> Regular employment. </p> <p><strong> 1963:</strong> Ceases regular employment. </p> <p><strong> 1964:</strong> Having raised his stake money betting on photo-finishes at Reading dogs, realises that good money can be made backing second favourites each-way when there is a long odds-on favourite. 'You'd be getting 6-4 against when it should be 3-1 on,' says Peters. </p> <p><strong> 1965-67:</strong> Works out way to make money on the Tote. 'When the bookies opened they would take any bet on anything and there was no minimum dividend. So if a dog was 8-1 on you'd get the same price for a place. There was nothing very clever about it.' </p> <p><strong> 1967-72:</strong> Refines system and becomes heavily involved in Tote rigging. 'I was betting at Hastings dogs one afternoon and realised how little money was gambled on the place pool. It cost me very little to increase the minimum dividend and it worked very well.' </p> <p><strong> 1972-77:</strong> Becomes very heavily involved in Tote rigging. 'I had 80 OAPs up and down the country working for me betting 12 of the straight forecast combinations off the track and we were betting the others at the track. We made a lot of money.' </p> <p><strong> 1982:</strong> Wife nags him into getting a proper job on grounds of 'status'. He invests in a company making plastic containers for then new-in-the-kitchen microwave ovens. Dumb move. 'I'm the only person I know who got all his money from gambling and lost it all in straight business.' </p> <p><strong> 1982-94:</strong> A bad dozen years. </p> <p><strong> 1994:</strong> Introduced to spread betting. 'All I had was three years' worth of Racing Posts .' </p> <p><strong> 1994-2000:</strong> Cleans up. </p> <p> He has made his money primarily from betting on the spreads offered on horse-race distances, but has also trousered tidy sums from betting on the bookings index and the corners index. On all three markets he has sold. His reasoning is simple. Most punters find it psychologically soothing for their downside to be limited and their upside to be unlimited. They know exactly how much they can lose and can dream about how much they might win. </p> <p>On the horse-race distances, about 19 out of 20 players would be buyers. Peters, a contrarian at heart, went the other way and turned nothing into \u00a3200,000. He has bad days - there have been a couple of \u00a340,000 losses - but most days are good. He has used the same principles to win on corners and bookings. He has made healthy profits by taking the 'uncomfortable position' where you win a little often and lose a lot rarely and come out on top.</p> <p> On the bookings index, in particular, he has been helped by the usual tabloid hype about card-crazy referees. The punters, whipped into a frenzy as effectively as Rebekah Wade inciting the unthinking majority, can't help themselves and buy away. The market is distorted. As Toby Brereton, chief market-maker at IG Index, says: 'Opposing hype is an extremely good tool for any bettor.' The latest market to attract the Peters Principle has been the time of Premiership goals. The spread makers have underestimated the number of goals in a match and therefore gone too high on the time of the opening goal. Once again, he has been selling and winning as the foolish crowd buy in the hope of that elusive big win. </p>",

'When the bookies opened they would take any bet on anything and there was no minimum dividend. So if a dog was 8-1 on you'd get the same price for a place. There was nothing very clever about it.' 1967-72: Refines system and becomes heavily involved in Tote rigging. 'I was betting at Hastings dogs one afternoon and realised how little money was gambled on the place pool. It cost me very little to increase the minimum dividend and it worked very well.' 1972-77: Becomes very heavily involved in Tote rigging. 'I had 80 OAPs up and down the country working for me betting 12 of the straight forecast combinations off the track and we were betting the others at the track. We made a lot of money.' 1982: Wife nags him into getting a proper job on grounds of 'status'. He invests in a company making plastic containers for then new-in-the-kitchen microwave ovens. Dumb move. 'I'm the only person I know who got all his money from gambling and lost it all in straight business.' 1982-94: A bad dozen years. 1994: Introduced to spread betting. 'All I had was three years' worth of Racing Posts .' 1994-2000: Cleans up. He has made his money primarily from betting on the spreads offered on horse-race distances, but has also trousered tidy sums from betting on the bookings index and the corners index. On all three markets he has sold. His reasoning is simple. Most punters find it psychologically soothing for their downside to be limited and their upside to be unlimited. They know exactly how much they can lose and can dream about how much they might win. On the horse-race distances, about 19 out of 20 players would be buyers. Peters, a contrarian at heart, went the other way and turned nothing into \u00a3200,000. He has bad days - there have been a couple of \u00a340,000 losses - but most days are good. He has used the same principles to win on corners and bookings. He has made healthy profits by taking the 'uncomfortable position' where you win a little often and lose a lot rarely and come out on top. On the bookings index, in particular, he has been helped by the usual tabloid hype about card-crazy referees. The punters, whipped into a frenzy as effectively as Rebekah Wade inciting the unthinking majority, can't help themselves and buy away. The market is distorted. As Toby Brereton, chief market-maker at IG Index, says: 'Opposing hype is an extremely good tool for any bettor.' The latest market to attract the Peters Principle has been the time of Premiership goals. The spread makers have underestimated the number of goals in a match and therefore gone too high on the time of the opening goal. Once again, he has been selling and winning as the foolish crowd buy in the hope of that elusive big win.",

      "body": "<p>Some friends of mine finally seem to have resolved the constipation that their two-year-old son, Freddie, has suffered from since birth. Technically speaking, childhood constipation is caused by an abnormal amount of waste matter building up in the lower bowel, which then becomes so hard and uncomfortable that the child is either unable, or afraid, to pass it, with the result that the waste in the bowel becomes even more compacted, thereby exacerbating the condition. Freddie could go for days without passing a stool, and frequently howled with pain when the root of the problem eventually shifted.</p> <p>Constipation has various triggers: the gut may temporarily seize up following an illness, while children may sometimes deliberately hold in motions after a bout of diarrhoea in case they have an 'accident'. In Freddie's case, because one stool had actually ripped his anus, he understandably did everything that he could to avoid the potentially painful process of going to the loo.</p> <p>Overenthusiastic potty-training on the part of parents may be to blame, too. If you put your child under too much pressure to perform on the potty, he may deliberately choose not to do so when he's angry. Another extreme reaction is that of a child I once saw in my practice who eventually had to have her bowel emptied in hospital. Her parents, who had put her 'accidents' down to laziness, had scolded her so much that she had become frightened to go to the loo. It is vital that you use positive feedback and do not criticise your child. If you think that it would help them, and they are old enough to understand, try introducing a reward system by recording lavatorial 'successes' on a chart, marking them with a star and then a reward for a collection of stars. Until they have established regular toilet habits, try to get into the habit of praising younger children and giving them a little treat each time they pass a stool. Encouraging Freddie to go to the loo regularly, made him feel more confident and less scared that he'd have an 'accident'.</p> <p>If your child is constipated, the first thing you should do is ascertain whether they are drinking enough fluids, which is especially important during the summer months. If you're still bottle-feeding, you may have to supplement their fluid intake with boiled water, or, once they've reached six to eight weeks of age, some undiluted, unsweetened fruit juice. Two-year-olds should drink at least half a litre of water a day, rising to three-quarters of a litre in the case of three-year-olds. It doesn't matter whether they drink still, sparkling or tap water, but avoid giving children sweetened juices, which will rot their teeth. And because water is far more hydrating than sweet drinks, and therefore better able to soften a stool, serve only water with meals.</p> <p>Because sweet and fatty foods tend to have a constipating effect, make sure that your child isn't eating too many fast foods, crisps or chocolates. Reserve them as treats - or even as rewards for regular toilet habits - and restrict your child to a couple of pieces of chocolate, for example, rather than a whole bar. Children who are allowed to overindulge in convenience foods are less likely to eat fruit, vegetables and wholegrains, all of which are essential fibre-providers, the fibres that they contain swell in the presence of water and stimulate the gut to move. All fruits and vegetables contain fibre, so the more of them your child eats, and the more water they drink, the less likely they are to become constipated.</p> <p>Certain fruits seem to have a particularly strong laxative effect, including figs, dates, apricots, papayas, prunes, rhubarb and soft fruits, such as plums. A small portion of fig and apricot pur\u00e9e can soon get the bowel going, and a little fruit pur\u00e9e can be given to children as young as four months old - as long as they've been cooked first to soften them. Dried fruits can be also be pur\u00e9ed as long as they have been soaked first and mixed with yogurt, added to fruit smoothies or served as an accompaniment to ice cream. You could also give your child a small glass of prune juice every day; either on its own or mixed with freshly squeezed orange juice. If your child is fussy about eating chunks of vegetables, try disguising them in pasta sauces, perhaps pur\u00e9eing tomato sauce with aubergines, carrots, onions and peppers.</p> <p>Cereals and pulses are also good sources of fibre, so try sneaking some chickpeas into home-made soups or chicken rissoles, filling jacket potatoes with baked beans or encouraging them to dip cucumber or carrot batons into a small bowl of hummus. Make toast soldiers with wholegrain bread, but as with all fibres, it's important not to overdo the fibre, at the expense of other valuable foods.</p> <p>Some children are allergic to, or intolerant of, wheat or dairy produce. If you suspect your child becomes constipated after eating a specific type of food, keep a food diary for a couple of weeks and also record when they go to the loo and whether - and, if so, when - they have a stomach ache, headache or any other symptom. Having analysed the food diary, if you think you can see a pattern, give your child less of the suspect food, and if this strategy has positive results, ask your doctor to refer you to a paediatric dietician for advice on how best to balance your child's diet.</p> <p>If, having tried the above tips, your child still remains constipated, visit your doctor, who may prescribe a mild laxative. Don't abandon my nutritional advice, however, because the more you can help to relieve your child's constipation through food, the less they will rely on laxative drugs. Above all, remember to be relaxed about your child's eating and toilet habits. Uptight children are likely to develop bowel problems, so the more you can do to calm them down, the fewer problems you'll all experience. <br><br> Jane Clarke is a state-registered dietician and author of The Bodyfoods series of books</p>",

And pass they do. Don't waste any time. Try it now. Dear Barefoot, I've been waking up tired and remaining so through the day. I've also been putting on weight, but haven't been eating more. Can you suggest anything? Susan Murphy, North Yorkshire This could indicate a spleen energy deficit. The spleen (according to Oriental physiology) regulates both weight and the strength of your blood. Pinch the skin on the back of your hand and release it. If it leaves a white mark, ie if the blood doesn't return quickly, it's likely you're anaemic and should visit a GP. It sounds like you need to be more sanguine. Munch on watercress, as this is one of the best ways to get a quick iron fix. Try Floradix natural tonic as well. Include millet in your diet to strengthen the spleen, and visit a shiatsu specialist to stimulate your spleen manually.",

      "body": "<p>Peshawar is a rough town. Its bazaars are thick with suppressed violence and its traders rarely smile. Five times a day the call to prayer howls through the air in a clatter of static and guttural vowels. At night the roads rattle with automatic gunfire and it is impossible to tell if there has been a wedding or an assassination. </p> <p>Many people die in Peshawar, violently or otherwise. Nobody chooses to end their days there. No one asks for his ashes to be scattered in the churned mud of the Storytellers Bazaar or from the battlements of the Purana Qila, the old fort. To the west of the city, the Khyber Pass leads up through the dusty, rocky hills of the Hindu Kush towards the border with Afghanistan. When the pollution above the city clears, the hills are sharp against a very blue sky. But they are gritty, sullen mountains and no traveller wants his bones to lie among them. </p> <p>Carlos Mavroleon didn't want to die here. Certainly not in the small, claustrophobic hotel room where they found his heroin-soaked body, on 27 August 1998. Carlos didn't want to die anywhere. Perhaps more than at any other time in his incredible life, Carlos wanted to be alive. </p> <p>He had packed it in to his 40 years. The old Etonian heir to a \u00a3100m fortune, he had been a war correspondent, a Wall Street broker, a lover of glamorous women from glamorous political dynasties (the Kennedys) and from less glamorous ones (the Heseltines). He had been a cool, gimlet-eyed war reporter, blowing off the tension of his assignments in the bars and clubs of Notting Hill. He had commanded a unit of Afghan Mujahideen against the Red Army and had been a bodyguard for a Pakistani tribal chief. And, for most of his adult life, Carlos had been a regular user of speed, coke, Ecstasy, heroin and enough pharmaceutical products to stock a large, if specialised, chemist. </p> <p>But through it all, it seems, he knew what he was doing. Carlos was rarely, if ever, out of control. He pushed it to the edge, looked over - and came back again. And again and again and again. Except in Peshawar on that stinking hot August day two years ago. </p> <p>On 7 August 1998, two massive blasts devastated the American embassies in Tanzania and Kenya and killed more than 200 people. American investigators followed the trail of the bombers from East Africa to Pakistan and on, via Peshawar, into eastern Afghanistan. Thirteen days after the explosions, President Clinton launched 75 cruise missiles against the camps that the CIA believed were run by Osama Bin Laden, the terrorist mastermind supposedly behind the attacks. It was called, slightly optimistically, Operation Infinite Reach, and successfully killed a dozen or so young Pakistanis who were training in the camps as well several blameless old men and a large number of goats. When the missiles went in, I was in Kandahar, a fiercely Islamic city in the desert south of Afghanistan. We heard of the attack at about midnight and I spent much of the night filing to my newspaper. It was only at dawn that I really began to realise the situation. We sat tight in the United Nations compound and listened to the radio and the chanting from the mosque. </p> <p>Feelings ran high in the aftermath of the strike. In Kandahar, it took a long speech from the most senior cleric in the city to stop the mob marching on us. In Kabul, the capital 300 miles to the north, two UN peacekeepers were machine-gunned, one fatally. There were huge demonstrations against the Americans across Pakistan. Reports started circulating in Peshawar that a bounty of $15,000 had been offered by Bin Laden for dead Westerners. </p> <p>Carlos was staying with his family at his father's seaside home in Athens when the missiles went in. He arrived back at his flat in Fulham, west London, to find 12 messages winking at him on the answerphone. Carlos was known to other journalists as a 'shithole specialist'. The worse the war, the deeper the poverty, the nastier the place, the better Carlos liked it. His favourite shithole was Afghanistan. The calls on his answerphone can't have been unexpected. He rang CBS, the American TV network, to accept an assignment for their flagship Sixty Minutes programme. Leslie Cockburn, the producer at CBS, knew him well. 'I can't imagine why you are calling,' he joked when he called her. 'By the way, I have a multiple Afghan visa.' </p> <p>CBS wanted him to get to Peshawar as soon as possible to try to get to the camps. The hardline Taliban militia who ruled much of Afghanistan - including the bit I was stuck in - were not letting any journalists into Afghanistan. To get into the country would mean travelling in disguise. It would be very risky. Even a team of Afghan journalists had been badly beaten up and narrowly escaped execution when they tried the same exercise. But if anyone could pull it off, he could. Carlos called his fianc\u00e9e, a 26-year-old TV researcher who he was due to marry in November, and then rang his father. 'Don't worry, papa, I'll be careful,' he told him. He packed his gear, picked up a $5,000 expenses advance and flew straight out to Pakistan on Emirates first class. He arrived in Peshawar on 23 August and checked into Green's hotel just off the central Saddar Bazaar. He had four days to live. </p> <p> Saddar police station is only a mile from Green's hotel. Ten days after Carlos' death a smiling detective called Nisar Ali Marwat flicked a brown file on to his glass-topped desk and told me to read it. Under a slowly rotating fan, I leafed through the badly typed pages. A heavily moustached sergeant brought sweet, milky tea in stained cups. Another, sitting on a broken chair behind me, played with his handgun while I read, emptying and refilling the magazine with small, snub-nosed bullets. </p> <p>The death certificate was numbered 83/98. It gave the cause of death as 'Heroin poisoning (self)'. The autopsy was conducted at 8am on 28 August by Professor Inayatur Rehman Khalil of the Khyber Medical College, Peshawar. Time of death: between 18 and 24 hours before the time of the autopsy. Carlos's body was fully rigormortised and showed no visible signs of violence. All organs were normal. The face and upper part of the chest were 'livid'. There was a blood-stained discharge from the right nostril. The left arm showed a prick-mark in the ante-cubital region and an insulin syringe contaminated with blood lay beside the body. The syringe tested positive for diacetyl morphine (heroin). Carlos's stomach also tested weakly for diacetyl morphine. There were three small packets of drugs in the room. One, opened, was diacetyl morphine. The second was crude powdered opium. The third was an antihistamine tranquilizer called chlorophenaramine maleate. </p> <p>According to the police statements, Carlos was sitting upright on his bed when he was found, a cigarette between his lips. The bloody syringe was on the coffee table in front of him. There was also a blackened coin. He had died of 'heroin asphyxiation'. </p> <p>A press photograph taken of his body as it was removed from the hotel shows a swarthy, good-looking man with tight, black curly hair that made him look much younger than his 40 years and a lean, muscular body. He was stripped to the waist when he died and was wearing baggy, local-style trousers. </p> <p>Another sheet of paper listed his belongings: satellite phone and spare battery, camera charger, British passport B451472, small video camera, Leatherman-style knife/tool, Sony audio recorder, first-aid kit, Maglite torch, tripod and head, Sony shortwave radio stethoscope, four syringes, duty-free pack of Marlboro Lights, sewing kit, video camera battery packs and charger, two shalwar kameez (local baggy trouser and shirt), white local prayer cap, local leather sandals, Holy Koran (translation), books of Islamic history - four, $1,800 in $100 bills, $2,400 in $50 bills, and 12,265 Pakistani rupees [\u00a3150]. </p> <p>I read the list and looked up at Nisar Ali Marwat. The man behind me had put his pistol away. The tea cups had left oily stains on the glass of his desk. He shrugged. </p> <p> When 'Bluey' Mavroleon said goodbye to his son for the last time he cannot have been too reassured by his promise to be careful. Carlos may have been kind, brave, intelligent and charming. But, by ordinary standards, he was not careful. </p> <p>But then Carlos had never lived by ordinary standards. He was born in April 1958 and grew up in the rarefied air of real high society, not the ersatz Hello! version. His father is a Greek shipping tycoon who was once married to Somerset Maugham's granddaughter Camilla. She eventually left him, when Carlos was three, for Count Freddy Chandon, head of the champagne house Mo\u00ebt et Chandon. Carlos's mother, Giaconda, is Mexican. His brother, Nicky, is married to the filmstar Barbara Carrera. The family fortune is estimated at \u00a3100m. Carlos's address book contained phone numbers for Fawn Hall, the secretary at the heart of the Iran-Contra affair and an old flame, Barbara Streisand and Christina Onassis. He went out with Annabel Heseltine, the journalist daughter of the former deputy prime minister for two years. She wanted to marry him. When it became clear that something awful had happened to Carlos, Ethel Kennedy, wife of Bobby senior, rang the White House to find out exactly what was wrong. </p> <p>In 1979, Bluey inherited the family fortune. Carlos grew up in London's Eaton and Cadogan squares and was sent to Eton but, though he did well, hated it. He started to rebel, at first in the ordinary ways; with left-wing politics, music that his parents wouldn't like, soft drugs and drink. But as ever he soon left the ordinary far behind. At 14, he left his privileged world and signed himself into a London comprehensive. </p> <p>After two years of taking a lot of LSD and indulging in 'industrial scale shoplifting', he told his parents he was going to the southwest of France to stay with friends. There were no phones, he said, so they wouldn't hear from him for at least two weeks. He had calculated that would give him enough time to get free. He planned to head to Burma and smuggle rubies. </p> <p>He got as far as Pakistan. High in the Hindu Kush foothills, close to the border with Afghanistan, in lands that are barely controlled by the current Pakistani administration let alone by the British Raj, Carlos did odd jobs - including bodyguard and labourer, learned to speak the guttural language of the Pashto tribesmen who looked after him and converted to Islam. He never contacted his family. They gave him up for dead. </p> <p>After nearly two years, he returned to Britain and Belgravia, thin, sick and still restless. His family welcomed him back, hopeful that his youthful wanderlust was sated. Carlos worked hard to get his A levels, but played hard, too. He moved from amphetamines and acid to heroin. Before long, he had picked up a serious habit which he never entirely shook. </p> <p>He may have been reckless, but he wasn't stupid. He crammed at Millfield, a top public school, and got a place at Princeton University. Not satisfied with that, he applied to Harvard and, on the strength of a successful interview and a fistful of forged references, got in to read politics. With his money and connections, he was soon mixing with the best of America's East Coast society. He was a favoured guest of the Kennedy clan. He had an affair with Mary Richardson, who later married Bobby Jnr, and a short fling with Fawn Hall. </p> <p>From Harvard he went on to Wall Street. It was the 80s and Carlos, intelligent, well-connected and bold, did well. He lived in Manhattan. He made a lot of money. And spent much of it on cocaine and heroin. </p> <p>And yet it wasn't enough. By 1985, the attractions of his Manhattan lifestyle had palled. He flew to Islamabad - the capital of Pakistan - and drove up to Peshawar. It was then the main headquarters and logistics base for the guerrilla groups. He introduced himself to them and convinced them to take him into Afghanistan. It was his first taste of war. Within months of returning to America he had sold the New York apartment and was on his way back to the sub-continent. He was 26. </p> <p> A canal runs through Peshawar. It is full of refuse and dead animals, but the children play in it anyway. By the banks of the canal, in a bungalow set back behind high walls and a courtyard, is the Afghan Media Resource Centre (AMRC). Throughout the Afghan war, it funded journalists' trips into Afghanistan and disseminated the material they collected. It is widely believed to have been set up and supported by the CIA. Carlos used to sleep on its floor between trips 'inside'. </p> <p>One of the films they have at the AMRC was taken in June 1988 near the eastern Afghan city of Jalalabad. I watched it an hour or so after reading through the police report on Carlos's death. A keen young Afghan projected it on to the only wall not covered in pictures of blown up tanks, dead guerrillas or Russian soldiers, burned out villages and downed helicopters. </p> <p>First the camera pans across a field full of Mujahideen fighters. They are waiting to go into action, squatting with their weapons in lines in the sun or standing in the shade of trees. In the background are the mountains typical of eastern Afghanistan. The film flickers, jumps and weaves. A bearded, grinning Carlos appears. </p> <p>'My name is Karimullah,' he says, his voice deep and unaccented. He is wearing the pakol - the beret-like woollen cap of northern Pakistan and Afghanistan - and has four curved magazines and an AK47 slung across his shoulders. He is a head taller than everyone else. His new name means 'blessed by God'. </p> <p>'I am a Mujahideen,' he continues. 'We are making an attack today on the city of Jalalabad. All the Mujahideen commanders have come together for this attack. I am very happy and proud to be with my Mujahideen brothers. Allahu Akbar. God is great.' Karimullah then continues in fluent Pashto. 'I am from London. In London I fought the Jihad with a pen. Now I fight it with a sword. I have come to Afghanistan to take part in the Jihad.' </p> <p>The cameraman asks if when the Jihad is over Carlos/Karimullah will bring his family to Afghanistan. 'Inshallah [God willing],' he replies with a broad smile. Carlos had arrived in Peshawar three years previously. At first he had been involved in the political side of the Mujahideen's struggle, handling foreign journalists and visiting American VIPs, but the urge to be physically involved in the action became too strong. By 1988, he was an experienced fighter and, according to former comrades-in-arms, a good one. </p> <p>'When you go into battle, you do what you are told. Karimullah would do whatever he was asked and do it well,' said one former comrade. Several former fighters said that by the end of his time in Afghanistan, Carlos was in charge of a dozen men and was running ambushes by himself. He was always in the thick of any action and even prayed longer and harder than his comrades. One former Mujahideen remembered how Carlos had gone outside for dawn prayers in a freezing gale and had returned wet through. 'We laughed at him when he came back in, but he just said \"Ahumdilallah [God be praised]\", and lay down again.' </p> <p>In 1989, the Soviets pulled out. The war carried on as the guerrillas took on the Moscow-backed government's forces, but Carlos was becoming disillusioned with the infighting among the various groups. It was time to reinvent himself again. He returned to London and within months had metamorphosed into a war correspondent. At the end of his time in Afghanistan he had worked as a cameraman and had shot footage of frontline action. With that, and his languages and charm, the work was soon rolling in. In 1991, he was in Oman trying to sneak, in disguise, into Kuwait during the Gulf War. He failed, but succeeded in getting into northern Iraq a few months later. The next assignment was Somalia, then the Sudan, Burma, Angola, Rwanda and back to Afghanistan. On several occasions, he found himself back in Peshawar. Twice he tried and failed to use his connections with the Mujahideen to get access to Osama Bin Laden. </p> <p>In the early 90s, he made a number of trips to Somalia for the American networks. Tim Deagle, a journalist who had worked with Carlos in East Africa, said their time together had revealed Carlos as 'a seriously good human being'. 'Despite everything we saw - and we saw hundreds of dead bodies in a day - he never lost his compassion. We went into one village and there were about three people left uninjured and he went around giving out first aid and looking after people. Most would have just taken their pictures and left.' </p> <p>Yet there was a spirit of recklessness in Carlos, a flamboyance, that seemed never to die. Deagle remembered his colleague insisted on a lunch-stop during a particularly chaotic moment during the fighting. 'He had found two lobsters, so we stopped in a field hospital with an army withdrawing around us and cooked them up and ate them with bayonets.' </p> <p>On another occasion, Deagle found Carlos standing on top of a jeep with a pistol in his hand, a huge stack of dollars in the other and a crowd of angry Somali gunmen around him. 'NBC and ABC had asked him to pay off the people they had hired for protection. Carlos told them all they had to pray before he would pay them. You or I would have been executed on the spot, but he got away with it. He always did.' </p> <p>In between trips, he had a number of relationships - 'women just flocked to him' according to his brother - and took a lot of cocaine. He spent time in the clubs and bars of Chelsea and Notting Hill. He read dozens of books, usually classics, and read and re-read TE Lawrence's Seven Pillars of Wisdom . He wrote book reviews for the Literary Review . Almost always he managed to keep his addiction hidden. Colleagues who he worked with closely for years never saw him take drugs. There are hints though that he did. Several people in Peshawar told me that he had got into an argument with an Afghan journalist after smoking heroin in Jalalabad. It was in 1996 after a second failed attempt to find Bin Laden. It seems Carlos didn't cope with disappointment well. </p> <p> Green's hotel is gloomy and claustrophobic. Poor backpackers and wealthy Pakistanis stay there, not journalists working for American networks. Carlos's room cost \u00a38 a night and was on the third floor facing east. From its small window there was a view of tangled electricity wires and roofs. </p> <p>Carlos arrived in Peshawar on the evening of Sunday 23 August. He dumped his bags and walked a hundred or so yards to the office of The News - a local paper - to catch up with Rahimullah Yusufzai, a Pathan reporter who knows everyone and everything. If Osama Bin Laden wants to talk to the Western world he gives a statement to Rahimullah. So do the Taliban. </p> <p>Rahimullah knew Carlos from the time of the Afghan war and was generous with his advice. He was happy to talk over the various ways to get to the bombed camps, even though he was trying to work out how to reach them himself. Yusufzai told Carlos what he must have suspected: that his only chance was to disguise himself as a local and work his way through the mountains and across the border. The best place to try, Rahimullah said, was from the small town of Miram Shah which is only a score or so miles from the camps themselves. The next day Carlos hired a car - a big Toyota pick-up - and a driver and set off. By nightfall he was at Bannu, a dusty town on the edge of the mountains, by late afternoon on the next day he was in Miram Shah itself. </p> <p>Within hours he was picked up by Pakistani intelligence services. It was the evening of Tuesday the 25th. Though the Pakistani spooks didn't touch him, they scared him. The whole of the country was jittery after the strikes and the intelligence services were more jumpy than anyone. Despite his credentials, he must have had a hard job convincing his interrogators of his true identity and purpose. After a tense and sleepless night he was put on a bus back to Peshawar. As he was not found to be in the possession of heroin when picked up on Tuesday evening, it is fair to assume that he bought the drug after his release from custody. </p> <p>Around 7.30pm the next day, Cockburn, his producer, began calling Carlos's satellite phone. It rang out every time. By the evening, she was very anxious. She called Green's and was told that Carlos had his key and was in his room which was locked. She kept trying the sat'phone. Eventually the hotel staff used a master key to open the door of the room. Carlos was dead on the bed. He had died a few hours earlier. </p> <p> I arrived in Peshawar on the day Carlos died. After three days stuck in the UN compound while the authorities tried to restrain angry mobs in the streets we were finally evacuated by the UN back to Pakistan and I had driven up to Peshawar to cover the story of the missile strikes' fall-out from there. After only a few hours in the city, a local newspaper editor, Faisal Quazi, called me on my mobile to ask if I knew anything about the dead British cameraman. </p> <p>That evening, Peter Jouvenal, a veteran cameraman who knew Carlos from the days of the Afghan war, mentioned over a drink that the dead man had been to Eton. Suddenly everyone wanted an answer to the same question: how did a man with so much end up dying in such a mean and sordid way? Two year's on there is still no good answer. And, as a result, though the authorities have officially closed the file, there are many who believe that the bald facts of the police report and the post-mortem are concealing something more sinister. </p> <p>One thing everyone seems to agree on is that Carlos would have been unlikely to have accidentally overdosed. Nicky Mavroleon pointed out that his brother was an experienced drug user. 'Carlos used to tell me that to him it was like having a drink. When he was having a good time he just wanted to get high... but he always knew what he was doing,' he said. Carlos did have a doctorate in drugs and he was far from unused to the vagaries of the local Peshawar heroin. </p> <p>Also, everyone seems to agree Carlos had not injected for years. Not since 1993 according to his doctor. He had been put off by a friend dying of Aids some years before, his father said. Would he suddenly switch back to syringes? Particularly if, as the police suggest, he had already been smoking the drug. </p> <p>Could he have committed suicide? Rahimullah Yusufzai saw him shortly before he died and said that though he was shaken by his ordeal at the hands of the intelligence men he was not too worried. A CNN cameraman who bumped into him in a Peshawar street later that day said, with no pun intended, that he 'seemed full of beans, really on a high'. </p> <p>'He told us how he had been in prison and seemed to think that it was all very amusing,' the cameraman said. 'He had a cutting from a local paper that said that he was a British spy which he said he was going to have framed.' </p> <p>Everybody who knew him said he was planning to settle down and was as happy as he had ever been. He was to marry in the autumn and was, according to his father, 'devoted' to his fianc\u00e9e. He had also never entirely lost his Muslim faith and in Islam suicide is as great a sin as it is in Catholicism. </p> <p>And it seems strange that he would be taking drugs at all. As an old south Asian hand, he must have known that, at least following his arrest, he would almost certainly be under surveillance? Would he have bought the heroin anyway? So would an experienced drug-user make a major mistake using a method he had given up at a time of his life when more than anything he wanted to be clean and happy? </p> <p>The answer has to be yes. If the suicide scenario is rejected, as it has to be, and the accidental overdose explanation is thrown out too, you are left with nothing but half-baked conspiracy theories. We know that he was tailed throughout his stay in Peshawar and that Green's hotel staff were interrogated by intelligence men both before and after his death. And we know that he was suspected of being a spy. And we can assume the intelligence services, who were tailing him, knew he had bought drugs. But Peshawar breeds conspiracy theories. The basic fact is that there are easier ways to kill someone than making them inject themselves with a deadly syringe. You have to apply Occam's Razor. What is more plausible - an accidental suicide or a plot involving spooks and forced overdoses? In the end, all that you are left with is a grieving family, a brown file on a police chief's desk, a dozen badly typed sheets of paper and the pathologist's 'Heroin poisoning (self)'. The most likely scenario is that a bitterly disappointed Carlos turned to the stand-by which had always helped him when he was feeling low. Relatives say that despite his amazing life he actually had very low self-esteem. The heroin was a prop when he felt down.</p> <p> And that afternoon in Peshawar the disappointment must have been acute. He desperately wanted the assignment to work. To have got the footage from the camps would have made him a media star. He was 40, wanted children, wanted to settle down and wanted some conventional respect from his more conventional peers. And having, in the last few years, watched reporters like Carlos working in Iraq, in Sierra Leone, in half a dozen other such places, I have seen, and felt the sense of heroic difference, the adolescent joy at your distance from the nine-to-five, from the office, from the suits. Heroin gives you that distance, too. If, when he returned to Green's hotel, Carlos momentarily lacked it he wouldn't for long. To start with he would have felt a mellow, sleepy high as the drug triggered the release of dopamine in his brain. It is quite likely that, if he started off smoking the drug, he would welcome the rush of an injection straight into the bloodstream. If you haven't been using the drug for a while the rush is, one regular heroin user tells me, intensified. A wave of contentment overcomes you. Things stop mattering. For Carlos, by the late afternoon of 27 August 1998, as the towers of Peshawar's mosques stretched their shadows across the superheated roofs of the city and the loudspeakers crackled into the Maghreb prayer, nothing mattered at all. </p> <p>I left Pakistan earlier this year. Every week I get calls from old friends and contacts in Peshawar and Islamabad. Recently, I have been asking if anything new has turned up on Carlos's death. People have forgotten it now, and these days I am offered friendly advice rather than information. 'Let sleeping ghosts lie,' said one police officer I know. </p> <p>If Carlos has a ghost it is unlikely to be sleeping.</p>",

Carlos Mavroleon didn't want to die here. Certainly not in the small, claustrophobic hotel room where they found his heroin-soaked body, on 27 August 1998. Carlos didn't want to die anywhere. Perhaps more than at any other time in his incredible life, Carlos wanted to be alive. He had packed it in to his 40 years. The old Etonian heir to a \u00a3100m fortune, he had been a war correspondent, a Wall Street broker, a lover of glamorous women from glamorous political dynasties (the Kennedys) and from less glamorous ones (the Heseltines). He had been a cool, gimlet-eyed war reporter, blowing off the tension of his assignments in the bars and clubs of Notting Hill. He had commanded a unit of Afghan Mujahideen against the Red Army and had been a bodyguard for a Pakistani tribal chief. And, for most of his adult life, Carlos had been a regular user of speed, coke, Ecstasy, heroin and enough pharmaceutical products to stock a large, if specialised, chemist. But through it all, it seems, he knew what he was doing. Carlos was rarely, if ever, out of control. He pushed it to the edge, looked over - and came back again. And again and again and again. Except in Peshawar on that stinking hot August day two years ago. On 7 August 1998, two massive blasts devastated the American embassies in Tanzania and Kenya and killed more than 200 people. American investigators followed the trail of the bombers from East Africa to Pakistan and on, via Peshawar, into eastern Afghanistan. Thirteen days after the explosions, President Clinton launched 75 cruise missiles against the camps that the CIA believed were run by Osama Bin Laden, the terrorist mastermind supposedly behind the attacks. It was called, slightly optimistically, Operation Infinite Reach, and successfully killed a dozen or so young Pakistanis who were training in the camps as well several blameless old men and a large number of goats. When the missiles went in, I was in Kandahar, a fiercely Islamic city in the desert south of Afghanistan. We heard of the attack at about midnight and I spent much of the night filing to my newspaper. It was only at dawn that I really began to realise the situation. We sat tight in the United Nations compound and listened to the radio and the chanting from the mosque. Feelings ran high in the aftermath of the strike. In Kandahar, it took a long speech from the most senior cleric in the city to stop the mob marching on us. In Kabul, the capital 300 miles to the north, two UN peacekeepers were machine-gunned, one fatally. There were huge demonstrations against the Americans across Pakistan. Reports started circulating in Peshawar that a bounty of $15,000 had been offered by Bin Laden for dead Westerners. Carlos was staying with his family at his father's seaside home in Athens when the missiles went in. He arrived back at his flat in Fulham, west London, to find 12 messages winking at him on the answerphone. Carlos was known to other journalists as a 'shithole specialist'. The worse the war, the deeper the poverty, the nastier the place, the better Carlos liked it. His favourite shithole was Afghanistan. The calls on his answerphone can't have been unexpected. He rang CBS, the American TV network, to accept an assignment for their flagship Sixty Minutes programme. Leslie Cockburn, the producer at CBS, knew him well. 'I can't imagine why you are calling,' he joked when he called her. 'By the way, I have a multiple Afghan visa.' CBS wanted him to get to Peshawar as soon as possible to try to get to the camps. The hardline Taliban militia who ruled much of Afghanistan - including the bit I was stuck in - were not letting any journalists into Afghanistan. To get into the country would mean travelling in disguise. It would be very risky. Even a team of Afghan journalists had been badly beaten up and narrowly escaped execution when they tried the same exercise. But if anyone could pull it off, he could. Carlos called his fianc\u00e9e, a 26-year-old TV researcher who he was due to marry in November, and then rang his father. 'Don't worry, papa, I'll be careful,' he told him. He packed his gear, picked up a $5,000 expenses advance and flew straight out to Pakistan on Emirates first class. He arrived in Peshawar on 23 August and checked into Green's hotel just off the central Saddar Bazaar. He had four days to live. Saddar police station is only a mile from Green's hotel. Ten days after Carlos' death a smiling detective called Nisar Ali Marwat flicked a brown file on to his glass-topped desk and told me to read it. Under a slowly rotating fan, I leafed through the badly typed pages. A heavily moustached sergeant brought sweet, milky tea in stained cups. Another, sitting on a broken chair behind me, played with his handgun while I read, emptying and refilling the magazine with small, snub-nosed bullets. The death certificate was numbered 83/98. It gave the cause of death as 'Heroin poisoning (self)'. The autopsy was conducted at 8am on 28 August by Professor Inayatur Rehman Khalil of the Khyber Medical College, Peshawar. Time of death: between 18 and 24 hours before the time of the autopsy. Carlos's body was fully rigormortised and showed no visible signs of violence. All organs were normal. The face and upper part of the chest were 'livid'. There was a blood-stained discharge from the right nostril. The left arm showed a prick-mark in the ante-cubital region and an insulin syringe contaminated with blood lay beside the body. The syringe tested positive for diacetyl morphine (heroin). Carlos's stomach also tested weakly for diacetyl morphine. There were three small packets of drugs in the room. One, opened, was diacetyl morphine. The second was crude powdered opium. The third was an antihistamine tranquilizer called chlorophenaramine maleate. According to the police statements, Carlos was sitting upright on his bed when he was found, a cigarette between his lips. The bloody syringe was on the coffee table in front of him. There was also a blackened coin. He had died of 'heroin asphyxiation'. A press photograph taken of his body as it was removed from the hotel shows a swarthy, good-looking man with tight, black curly hair that made him look much younger than his 40 years and a lean, muscular body. He was stripped to the waist when he died and was wearing baggy, local-style trousers. Another sheet of paper listed his belongings: satellite phone and spare battery, camera charger, British passport B451472, small video camera, Leatherman-style knife/tool, Sony audio recorder, first-aid kit, Maglite torch, tripod and head, Sony shortwave radio stethoscope, four syringes, duty-free pack of Marlboro Lights, sewing kit, video camera battery packs and charger, two shalwar kameez (local baggy trouser and shirt), white local prayer cap, local leather sandals, Holy Koran (translation), books of Islamic history - four, $1,800 in $100 bills, $2,400 in $50 bills, and 12,265 Pakistani rupees [\u00a3150]. I read the list and looked up at Nisar Ali Marwat. The man behind me had put his pistol away. The tea cups had left oily stains on the glass of his desk. He shrugged. When 'Bluey' Mavroleon said goodbye to his son for the last time he cannot have been too reassured by his promise to be careful. Carlos may have been kind, brave, intelligent and charming. But, by ordinary standards, he was not careful. But then Carlos had never lived by ordinary standards. He was born in April 1958 and grew up in the rarefied air of real high society, not the ersatz Hello! version. His father is a Greek shipping tycoon who was once married to Somerset Maugham's granddaughter Camilla. She eventually left him, when Carlos was three, for Count Freddy Chandon, head of the champagne house Mo\u00ebt et Chandon. Carlos's mother, Giaconda, is Mexican. His brother, Nicky, is married to the filmstar Barbara Carrera. The family fortune is estimated at \u00a3100m. Carlos's address book contained phone numbers for Fawn Hall, the secretary at the heart of the Iran-Contra affair and an old flame, Barbara Streisand and Christina Onassis. He went out with Annabel Heseltine, the journalist daughter of the former deputy prime minister for two years. She wanted to marry him. When it became clear that something awful had happened to Carlos, Ethel Kennedy, wife of Bobby senior, rang the White House to find out exactly what was wrong. In 1979, Bluey inherited the family fortune. Carlos grew up in London's Eaton and Cadogan squares and was sent to Eton but, though he did well, hated it. He started to rebel, at first in the ordinary ways; with left-wing politics, music that his parents wouldn't like, soft drugs and drink. But as ever he soon left the ordinary far behind. At 14, he left his privileged world and signed himself into a London comprehensive. After two years of taking a lot of LSD and indulging in 'industrial scale shoplifting', he told his parents he was going to the southwest of France to stay with friends. There were no phones, he said, so they wouldn't hear from him for at least two weeks. He had calculated that would give him enough time to get free. He planned to head to Burma and smuggle rubies. He got as far as Pakistan. High in the Hindu Kush foothills, close to the border with Afghanistan, in lands that are barely controlled by the current Pakistani administration let alone by the British Raj, Carlos did odd jobs - including bodyguard and labourer, learned to speak the guttural language of the Pashto tribesmen who looked after him and converted to Islam. He never contacted his family. They gave him up for dead. After nearly two years, he returned to Britain and Belgravia, thin, sick and still restless. His family welcomed him back, hopeful that his youthful wanderlust was sated. Carlos worked hard to get his A levels, but played hard, too. He moved from amphetamines and acid to heroin. Before long, he had picked up a serious habit which he never entirely shook. He may have been reckless, but he wasn't stupid. He crammed at Millfield, a top public school, and got a place at Princeton University. Not satisfied with that, he applied to Harvard and, on the strength of a successful interview and a fistful of forged references, got in to read politics. With his money and connections, he was soon mixing with the best of America's East Coast society. He was a favoured guest of the Kennedy clan. He had an affair with Mary Richardson, who later married Bobby Jnr, and a short fling with Fawn Hall. From Harvard he went on to Wall Street. It was the 80s and Carlos, intelligent, well-connected and bold, did well. He lived in Manhattan. He made a lot of money. And spent much of it on cocaine and heroin. And yet it wasn't enough. By 1985, the attractions of his Manhattan lifestyle had palled. He flew to Islamabad - the capital of Pakistan - and drove up to Peshawar. It was then the main headquarters and logistics base for the guerrilla groups. He introduced himself to them and convinced them to take him into Afghanistan. It was his first taste of war. Within months of returning to America he had sold the New York apartment and was on his way back to the sub-continent. He was 26. A canal runs through Peshawar. It is full of refuse and dead animals, but the children play in it anyway. By the banks of the canal, in a bungalow set back behind high walls and a courtyard, is the Afghan Media Resource Centre (AMRC). Throughout the Afghan war, it funded journalists' trips into Afghanistan and disseminated the material they collected. It is widely believed to have been set up and supported by the CIA. Carlos used to sleep on its floor between trips 'inside'. One of the films they have at the AMRC was taken in June 1988 near the eastern Afghan city of Jalalabad. I watched it an hour or so after reading through the police report on Carlos's death. A keen young Afghan projected it on to the only wall not covered in pictures of blown up tanks, dead guerrillas or Russian soldiers, burned out villages and downed helicopters. First the camera pans across a field full of Mujahideen fighters. They are waiting to go into action, squatting with their weapons in lines in the sun or standing in the shade of trees. In the background are the mountains typical of eastern Afghanistan. The film flickers, jumps and weaves. A bearded, grinning Carlos appears. 'My name is Karimullah,' he says, his voice deep and unaccented. He is wearing the pakol - the beret-like woollen cap of northern Pakistan and Afghanistan - and has four curved magazines and an AK47 slung across his shoulders. He is a head taller than everyone else. His new name means 'blessed by God'. 'I am a Mujahideen,' he continues. 'We are making an attack today on the city of Jalalabad. All the Mujahideen commanders have come together for this attack. I am very happy and proud to be with my Mujahideen brothers. Allahu Akbar. God is great.' Karimullah then continues in fluent Pashto. 'I am from London. In London I fought the Jihad with a pen. Now I fight it with a sword. I have come to Afghanistan to take part in the Jihad.' The cameraman asks if when the Jihad is over Carlos/Karimullah will bring his family to Afghanistan. 'Inshallah [God willing],' he replies with a broad smile. Carlos had arrived in Peshawar three years previously. At first he had been involved in the political side of the Mujahideen's struggle, handling foreign journalists and visiting American VIPs, but the urge to be physically involved in the action became too strong. By 1988, he was an experienced fighter and, according to former comrades-in-arms, a good one. 'When you go into battle, you do what you are told. Karimullah would do whatever he was asked and do it well,' said one former comrade. Several former fighters said that by the end of his time in Afghanistan, Carlos was in charge of a dozen men and was running ambushes by himself. He was always in the thick of any action and even prayed longer and harder than his comrades. One former Mujahideen remembered how Carlos had gone outside for dawn prayers in a freezing gale and had returned wet through. 'We laughed at him when he came back in, but he just said \"Ahumdilallah [God be praised]\", and lay down again.' In 1989, the Soviets pulled out. The war carried on as the guerrillas took on the Moscow-backed government's forces, but Carlos was becoming disillusioned with the infighting among the various groups. It was time to reinvent himself again. He returned to London and within months had metamorphosed into a war correspondent. At the end of his time in Afghanistan he had worked as a cameraman and had shot footage of frontline action. With that, and his languages and charm, the work was soon rolling in. In 1991, he was in Oman trying to sneak, in disguise, into Kuwait during the Gulf War. He failed, but succeeded in getting into northern Iraq a few months later. The next assignment was Somalia, then the Sudan, Burma, Angola, Rwanda and back to Afghanistan. On several occasions, he found himself back in Peshawar. Twice he tried and failed to use his connections with the Mujahideen to get access to Osama Bin Laden. In the early 90s, he made a number of trips to Somalia for the American networks. Tim Deagle, a journalist who had worked with Carlos in East Africa, said their time together had revealed Carlos as 'a seriously good human being'. 'Despite everything we saw - and we saw hundreds of dead bodies in a day - he never lost his compassion. We went into one village and there were about three people left uninjured and he went around giving out first aid and looking after people. Most would have just taken their pictures and left.' Yet there was a spirit of recklessness in Carlos, a flamboyance, that seemed never to die. Deagle remembered his colleague insisted on a lunch-stop during a particularly chaotic moment during the fighting. 'He had found two lobsters, so we stopped in a field hospital with an army withdrawing around us and cooked them up and ate them with bayonets.' On another occasion, Deagle found Carlos standing on top of a jeep with a pistol in his hand, a huge stack of dollars in the other and a crowd of angry Somali gunmen around him. 'NBC and ABC had asked him to pay off the people they had hired for protection. Carlos told them all they had to pray before he would pay them. You or I would have been executed on the spot, but he got away with it. He always did.' In between trips, he had a number of relationships - 'women just flocked to him' according to his brother - and took a lot of cocaine. He spent time in the clubs and bars of Chelsea and Notting Hill. He read dozens of books, usually classics, and read and re-read TE Lawrence's Seven Pillars of Wisdom . He wrote book reviews for the Literary Review . Almost always he managed to keep his addiction hidden. Colleagues who he worked with closely for years never saw him take drugs. There are hints though that he did. Several people in Peshawar told me that he had got into an argument with an Afghan journalist after smoking heroin in Jalalabad. It was in 1996 after a second failed attempt to find Bin Laden. It seems Carlos didn't cope with disappointment well. Green's hotel is gloomy and claustrophobic. Poor backpackers and wealthy Pakistanis stay there, not journalists working for American networks. Carlos's room cost \u00a38 a night and was on the third floor facing east. From its small window there was a view of tangled electricity wires and roofs. Carlos arrived in Peshawar on the evening of Sunday 23 August. He dumped his bags and walked a hundred or so yards to the office of The News - a local paper - to catch up with Rahimullah Yusufzai, a Pathan reporter who knows everyone and everything. If Osama Bin Laden wants to talk to the Western world he gives a statement to Rahimullah. So do the Taliban. Rahimullah knew Carlos from the time of the Afghan war and was generous with his advice. He was happy to talk over the various ways to get to the bombed camps, even though he was trying to work out how to reach them himself. Yusufzai told Carlos what he must have suspected: that his only chance was to disguise himself as a local and work his way through the mountains and across the border. The best place to try, Rahimullah said, was from the small town of Miram Shah which is only a score or so miles from the camps themselves. The next day Carlos hired a car - a big Toyota pick-up - and a driver and set off. By nightfall he was at Bannu, a dusty town on the edge of the mountains, by late afternoon on the next day he was in Miram Shah itself. Within hours he was picked up by Pakistani intelligence services. It was the evening of Tuesday the 25th. Though the Pakistani spooks didn't touch him, they scared him. The whole of the country was jittery after the strikes and the intelligence services were more jumpy than anyone. Despite his credentials, he must have had a hard job convincing his interrogators of his true identity and purpose. After a tense and sleepless night he was put on a bus back to Peshawar. As he was not found to be in the possession of heroin when picked up on Tuesday evening, it is fair to assume that he bought the drug after his release from custody. Around 7.30pm the next day, Cockburn, his producer, began calling Carlos's satellite phone. It rang out every time. By the evening, she was very anxious. She called Green's and was told that Carlos had his key and was in his room which was locked. She kept trying the sat'phone. Eventually the hotel staff used a master key to open the door of the room. Carlos was dead on the bed. He had died a few hours earlier. I arrived in Peshawar on the day Carlos died. After three days stuck in the UN compound while the authorities tried to restrain angry mobs in the streets we were finally evacuated by the UN back to Pakistan and I had driven up to Peshawar to cover the story of the missile strikes' fall-out from there. After only a few hours in the city, a local newspaper editor, Faisal Quazi, called me on my mobile to ask if I knew anything about the dead British cameraman. That evening, Peter Jouvenal, a veteran cameraman who knew Carlos from the days of the Afghan war, mentioned over a drink that the dead man had been to Eton. Suddenly everyone wanted an answer to the same question: how did a man with so much end up dying in such a mean and sordid way? Two year's on there is still no good answer. And, as a result, though the authorities have officially closed the file, there are many who believe that the bald facts of the police report and the post-mortem are concealing something more sinister. One thing everyone seems to agree on is that Carlos would have been unlikely to have accidentally overdosed. Nicky Mavroleon pointed out that his brother was an experienced drug user. 'Carlos used to tell me that to him it was like having a drink. When he was having a good time he just wanted to get high... but he always knew what he was doing,' he said. Carlos did have a doctorate in drugs and he was far from unused to the vagaries of the local Peshawar heroin. Also, everyone seems to agree Carlos had not injected for years. Not since 1993 according to his doctor. He had been put off by a friend dying of Aids some years before, his father said. Would he suddenly switch back to syringes? Particularly if, as the police suggest, he had already been smoking the drug. Could he have committed suicide? Rahimullah Yusufzai saw him shortly before he died and said that though he was shaken by his ordeal at the hands of the intelligence men he was not too worried. A CNN cameraman who bumped into him in a Peshawar street later that day said, with no pun intended, that he 'seemed full of beans, really on a high'. 'He told us how he had been in prison and seemed to think that it was all very amusing,' the cameraman said. 'He had a cutting from a local paper that said that he was a British spy which he said he was going to have framed.' Everybody who knew him said he was planning to settle down and was as happy as he had ever been. He was to marry in the autumn and was, according to his father, 'devoted' to his fianc\u00e9e. He had also never entirely lost his Muslim faith and in Islam suicide is as great a sin as it is in Catholicism. And it seems strange that he would be taking drugs at all. As an old south Asian hand, he must have known that, at least following his arrest, he would almost certainly be under surveillance? Would he have bought the heroin anyway? So would an experienced drug-user make a major mistake using a method he had given up at a time of his life when more than anything he wanted to be clean and happy? The answer has to be yes. If the suicide scenario is rejected, as it has to be, and the accidental overdose explanation is thrown out too, you are left with nothing but half-baked conspiracy theories. We know that he was tailed throughout his stay in Peshawar and that Green's hotel staff were interrogated by intelligence men both before and after his death. And we know that he was suspected of being a spy. And we can assume the intelligence services, who were tailing him, knew he had bought drugs. But Peshawar breeds conspiracy theories. The basic fact is that there are easier ways to kill someone than making them inject themselves with a deadly syringe. You have to apply Occam's Razor. What is more plausible - an accidental suicide or a plot involving spooks and forced overdoses? In the end, all that you are left with is a grieving family, a brown file on a police chief's desk, a dozen badly typed sheets of paper and the pathologist's 'Heroin poisoning (self)'. The most likely scenario is that a bitterly disappointed Carlos turned to the stand-by which had always helped him when he was feeling low. Relatives say that despite his amazing life he actually had very low self-esteem. The heroin was a prop when he felt down. And that afternoon in Peshawar the disappointment must have been acute. He desperately wanted the assignment to work. To have got the footage from the camps would have made him a media star. He was 40, wanted children, wanted to settle down and wanted some conventional respect from his more conventional peers. And having, in the last few years, watched reporters like Carlos working in Iraq, in Sierra Leone, in half a dozen other such places, I have seen, and felt the sense of heroic difference, the adolescent joy at your distance from the nine-to-five, from the office, from the suits. Heroin gives you that distance, too. If, when he returned to Green's hotel, Carlos momentarily lacked it he wouldn't for long. To start with he would have felt a mellow, sleepy high as the drug triggered the release of dopamine in his brain. It is quite likely that, if he started off smoking the drug, he would welcome the rush of an injection straight into the bloodstream. If you haven't been using the drug for a while the rush is, one regular heroin user tells me, intensified. A wave of contentment overcomes you. Things stop mattering. For Carlos, by the late afternoon of 27 August 1998, as the towers of Peshawar's mosques stretched their shadows across the superheated roofs of the city and the loudspeakers crackled into the Maghreb prayer, nothing mattered at all. I left Pakistan earlier this year. Every week I get calls from old friends and contacts in Peshawar and Islamabad. Recently, I have been asking if anything new has turned up on Carlos's death. People have forgotten it now, and these days I am offered friendly advice rather than information. 'Let sleeping ghosts lie,' said one police officer I know. If Carlos has a ghost it is unlikely to be sleeping.",

      "body": "<p>Submission is making a come-back. 'We scrub your floors the old-fashioned way,' boasts the brochure from Merry Maids, the largest of the residential-cleaning services that have sprung up in America in the past two decades, 'on our hands and knees.' </p> <p>Recently, I spent three weeks as an employee of The Maids International in Portland, Maine, cleaning, along with my fellow team members, approximately 60 houses containing a total of about 250 scrubbable floors - bathrooms, kitchens and entryways requiring the hands-and-knees treatment.</p> <p> It's a different world down there below knee level, one that few adults voluntarily enter. Here you find elaborate dust structures held together by a scaffolding of dog hair; dried bits of pasta glued to the floor by their sauce; the congealed remains of gravies, jellies, contraceptive creams, vomit and urine. Sometimes, too, you encounter some fragment of a human being: a child's legs, stamping by in disgust because the cleaner is still there when he gets home from school; more commonly, the electrolysed calves of the female homeowner. Look up and you may find this person staring at you, arms folded, in anticipation of an overlooked stain.</p> <p> In rare instances she may try to help in some vague way or apologise for the leaves shed by a miniature indoor tree. Mostly, though, she will not see you at all and may even sit down with her post at a table in the room you are cleaning, where she would remain unaware of your existence unless you were to crawl under that table and start gnawing away at her ankles. </p> <p>Housework, as you may recall from the feminist theories of the 60s and 70s, was supposed to be the great equaliser of women. Whatever else women did, we also did housework. If men thought of the home as a site of leisure and recreation - a 'haven in a heartless world' - this was to ignore the invisible female proletariat that kept it cosy and humming. We were on the march, or so we imagined, united against a society that devalued our labour even as it waxed mawkish over 'the family' and 'the home'. </p> <p>We railed against husbands and boyfriends who refused to pick up after themselves, who were unaware of housework at all, unless of course it hadn't been done. Wherever second-wave feminism took root, battles broke out between lovers and spouses over sticky countertops, piled-up laundry, and whose turn it was to do the dishes. The radical new idea was that housework was not only a relationship between a woman and a Hoover or an unmade bed; it also defined a relationship between human beings, typically husbands and wives. Hence the feminist perception of housework as one more way by which men exploit women. </p> <p>We rejected the servant option. There already were at least two able-bodied adults in the average home - a man and a woman - and the hope was that, after a few initial skirmishes, they would learn to share the housework graciously. </p> <p>A couple of decades later, however, the average household still falls far short of that goal. True, women do almost half the amount of housework they did before the feminist revolution and the rise of the two-income family - a decline that reflects a relaxation of standards rather than a redistribution of chores. Yet women still do two-thirds of whatever housework - including bill paying, pet care, tidying and lawn care - gets done. The inequity is sharpest for the most despised of household chores, cleaning: in the 30 years between 1965 and 1995, American men increased the time they spent scrubbing, vacuuming, and sweeping by 240 per cent - all the way up to 1.7 hours per week - while women decreased their cleaning time by only 7 per cent, to 6.7 hours per week. In the UK, a survey of British parents in 1996 revealed fathers spend an average of two hours cleaning per week, compared to 13.25 hours by mothers. </p> <p>These averages conceal a variety of arrangements, of course, from minutely negotiated sharing to the most clich\u00e9d division of labour, as described by one woman I heard of, who recently said: 'I take care of the inside, he takes care of the outside.' But perhaps the most disturbing finding is that almost the entire increase in male participation took place between the 70s and the mid-80s. Fifteen years after the apparent cessation of hostilities, it is probably not too soon to announce the score: in the 'chore wars' of the 70s and 80s, women gained a little ground, but overall, and after a few strategic concessions, men won. </p> <p>Enter then, the cleaning lady. Marriage counsellors recommend her as an alternative to squabbling, as do many within the cleaning industry itself. A cleaning woman quotes one of her clients as saying that if she gives up the service, 'My husband and I will be divorced in six months.' </p> <p> When the trend toward hiring out was just beginning to take off, in 1988, the owner of a Merry Maids franchise in Arlington, Massachusetts, said: 'I kid some women. I say, \"We even save marriages. In this new 80s period, you expect more from the male partner, but very often you don't get the co-operation you would like to have. The alternative is to pay somebody to come in...\"' Another Merry Maids franchise owner has learned to capitalise more directly on housework-related spats: he closes a third of his sales by making follow-up calls Saturday mornings, which is 'prime time for arguing over the fact that the house is a mess'. The micro-defeat of feminism in the household opened a new door for women - only this time it was the servants' entrance. </p> <p>The cleaning industry is booming. Among my middle-class, professional-women friends and acquaintances, including some who made important contributions to the early feminist analysis of housework, the employment of a maid is now nearly universal. Strangely, or perhaps not so strangely, no one talks about the 'politics of housework' any more. The demand for 'wages for housework' has sunk to the status of a curio. Among feminist sociologists, housework has lost much of its former cachet - in part, I suspect, because fewer sociologists actually do it. The home, or at least the affluent home, is finally becoming what radical feminists in the 70s only imagined it was - a true 'workplace' for women and a tiny, though increasingly visible, part of the capitalist economy. And the question is: as the home becomes a workplace for someone else, is it still a place where you would want to live? </p> <p>The 'cleaning boom' is concentrated among chains such as Merry Maids, Molly Maids, Mini Maids, Maid Brigade, and The Maids International - all named, curiously enough, to highlight the more antique aspects of the industry, though the 'maid' may occasionally be male. These corporate cleaning services have abolished the mistress-maid relationship. The customer hires the service, not the maid, who has been replaced by a team of two to four uniformed people, only one of whom - the team leader - is usually authorised to speak to the customer. The maids' wages, their taxes, their backaches, and childcare problems are all the concern of the company, meaning the local franchise owner. If there are complaints on either side, they are addressed to the franchise owner; the customer and the actual workers need never interact. Since the franchise owner is usually a middle-class white person, cleaning services are the ideal solution for anyone still sensitive enough to find the traditional employer-maid relationship morally vexing. </p> <p>Dan Libby, my boss at The Maids, confided to me that he could double his business overnight if only he could find enough reliable employees. To this end, The Maids offers a week's paid vacation, health insurance after 90 days and a free breakfast every morning consisting of coffee, doughnuts, bagels and bananas. Some franchises have dealt with the tight labour market by participating in welfare-to-work projects that not only funnel employees to them but often subsidise their paycheques with public money, at least for the first few months of work (which doesn't mean that the newly minted maid earns more, only that the company has to pay her less). The Merry Maids franchise in the city where I worked is conveniently located a block away from the city's welfare office. </p> <p>Among the women I worked with at The Maids, only one said she had previously worked as an independent, and she professed to be pleased with her new status as a cleaning-service employee. She no longer needed a car to get her from house to house and could take a day off - unpaid, of course - to stay home with a sick child without risking the loss of a customer. I myself could see the advantage of not having to deal directly with the customers, who were sometimes at home while we worked and eager to make use of their supervisory skills: criticisms of our methods, and demands that we perform unscheduled tasks, could simply be referred to the franchise owner. </p> <p>But there are inevitable losses for the workers as any industry moves from the entrepreneurial to the industrial phase, probably most strikingly, in this case, in the matter of pay. At Merry Maids, I was promised $200 for a 40-hour week, the manager hastening to add that 'you can't calculate it in dollars per hour' since the 40 hours include all the time spent travelling from house to house - up to five houses a day - which is unpaid. The Maids International, with its straightforward starting rate of $6.63 an hour, seemed preferable, though this rate was conditional on perfect attendance. Miss one day and your wage dropped to $6 an hour for two weeks, a rule that weighed particularly heavily on those who had young children. </p> <p>In addition, I soon learned that management had ways of shaving off nearly an hour's worth of wages a day. We were told to arrive at 7.30am, but our billable hours began only after we had been teamed up, given our list of houses for the day, and packed off in the company car at about 8am. At the end of the day, we were no longer paid from the moment we left the car, though as much as 15 minutes of work - refilling cleaning-fluid bottles, etc - remained to be done. So for a standard nine-hour day, the actual pay amounted to about $6.10 an hour, unless you were still being punished for an absence, in which case it came out to $5.50 an hour. </p> <p>Nor are cleaning-service employees likely to receive any of the perks or tips familiar to independents - free lunches and coffee, cast-off clothing or a Christmas gift of cash. When I asked, only one of my co-workers could recall ever receiving a tip, and that was a voucher for a free meal at a downtown restaurant owned by a customer. The customers of cleaning services are probably no stingier than the employers of independents; they just don't know their cleaning people and probably wouldn't even recognise them on the street. Plus, customers probably assume that the fee they pay the service - $25 per person-hour, in the case of The Maids franchise - goes largely to the workers who do the actual cleaning. </p> <p> The most interesting feature of the cleaning- service chains, at least from an abstract, historical perspective, is that they are finally transforming the home into a fully capitalist-style workplace, and in ways that the old wages-for-housework advocates could never have imagined. A house is an innately difficult workplace to control, especially a house with 10 or more rooms like so many of those we cleaned; workers may remain out of one another's sight for as much as an hour at a time. For independents, the ungovernable nature of the home-as-workplace means a certain amount of autonomy. They can take breaks (though this is probably ill-advised if the homeowner is on the premises); they can ease the monotony by listening to the radio or TV while they work. </p> <p>But cleaning services lay down rules meant to enforce a factorylike - or even conventlike - discipline on their far-flung employees. At The Maids, there were no breaks except for a daily 10-minute stop at a convenience store for coffee or 'lunch' - meaning something like a slice of pizza. Otherwise, the time spent driving between houses was considered our 'break' and the only chance to eat, drink or (although this was also officially forbidden) smoke a cigarette. When the houses were spaced well apart, I could eat my sandwich in one sitting; otherwise it would have to be divided into as many as three separate, hasty snacks. </p> <p>In a customer's house, nothing was to touch our lips at all, not even water - a rule that, on hot days, I sometimes broke by drinking from a bathroom tap. TVs and radios were off-limits, and we were never, ever, to curse out loud, even in an ostensibly deserted house. There might be a homeowner secreted in some locked room, we were told, ear pressed to the door, or, more likely, a tape recorder or video camera running. At the time, I dismissed this as a scare story, but I have since come across ads for devices like the Tech-7 'incredible coin-sized camera' designed to 'get a visual record of your babysitter's actions' and 'watch employees to prevent theft'. It was the threat or rumour of hidden recording devices that provided the final capitalist-industrial touch: supervision. </p> <p>What makes the work most factory-like, though, is the intense regimen imposed by the companies. An independent, or a person cleaning his or her own home, chooses where she will start and, in each room, probably tackles the most egregious dirt first. Or she may plan her work more or less ergonomically, first doing whatever can be done from a standing position and then crouching to reach the lower levels. But with the special 'systems' devised by the cleaning services and imparted to employees via training videos, there are no such decisions to make. </p> <p> <strong> In The Maids' 'healthy touch' system, which is </strong> similar to what I saw of the Merry Maids' system on the training tape I was shown during my interview, all cleaning is divided into four task areas - dusting, vacuuming, kitchens, and bathrooms - which are in turn divided among the team members. For each task area other than vacuuming, there is a bucket containing appropriate cleaning fluids, so the biggest decision an employee has to make is which fluid and scrubbing instrument to deploy on which kind of surface; almost everything else has been choreographed in advance. When vacuuming, you begin with the master bedroom; when dusting, with the first room off the kitchen; then you move through the rooms, going left to right. When entering each room, you proceed from left to right and top to bottom, and the same with each surface - top to bottom, left to right. </p> <p>Deviations are subject to rebuke, as I discovered when a team leader caught me moving my arm from right to left, then left to right, while wiping Windex over a French door. It's not easy for anyone with extensive cleaning experience - and I include myself in this category - to accept this loss of autonomy. But I came to love the system. First, because if you hadn't always been travelling rigorously from left to right it would have been easy to lose your way in some of the larger houses and omit or redo a room. Second, some of the houses were already clean when we started, at least by any normal standards, thanks probably to a housekeeper who kept things up between our visits - but the absence of visible dirt did not mean there was less work to do, for no surface could ever be neglected, so it was important to have 'the system' to remind you of where you had been and what you had already 'cleaned'. </p> <p>No doubt the biggest advantage of the system, though, is that it helps you achieve the speed demanded by the company, which allots only so many minutes per house. After a week or two on the job, I found myself moving robotlike from surface to surface, grateful to have been relieved of the thinking process. </p> <p>The irony, which I was often exhausted enough to derive a certain malicious satisfaction from, is that 'the system' is not very sanitary. When I saw the training videos on 'Kitchens' and 'Bathrooms', I was at first baffled, and it took me several minutes to realise why: there is no water, or almost no water, involved. I had been taught to clean by my mother, a compulsive housekeeper who employed water so hot you needed rubber gloves to get into it and in such Niagara-like quantities that most microbes were probably crushed by the force of it before the soap suds had a chance to rupture their cell walls. </p> <p>But germs are never mentioned in the videos provided by The Maids. Our antagonists existed entirely in the visible world - soap scum, dust, counter crud, dog hair, stains and smears - and were attacked by damp rag or, in hardcore cases, by a scouring pad. We scrubbed only to remove impurities that might be detectable to a customer by hand or by eye; otherwise our only job was to wipe. Nothing was ever said, in the videos or in person, about the possibility of transporting bacteria from bathroom to kitchen or even from one house to the next. </p> <p>Instead, it is the 'cosmetic touches' that the videos emphasise and to which my trainer continually directed my eye. Fluff out all throw-pillows and arrange them symmetrically. Brighten up stainless-steel sinks with baby oil. Leave all spice jars, shampoos, etc, with their labels facing outward. Comb out the fringes of Persian carpets with a pick. Use the vacuum to create a special, fernlike pattern in the carpets. The loose ends of loo paper and paper towel rolls have to be given a special fold. Finally, the house is sprayed with the service's signature air freshener - a cloying floral scent. </p> <p>When I described the 'methods' employed to cleaning expert Cheryl Mendelson, she was incredulous. A rag moistened with disinfectant will not get a countertop clean, she told me, because most disinfectants are inactivated by contact with organic matter - ie, dirt - so their effectiveness declines with each swipe of the rag. What you need is a detergent and hot water, followed by a rinse. As for floors, she judged the amount of water we used - one half of a small bucket - to be grossly inadequate, and, in fact, the water I wiped around on floors was often an unsavoury gray. </p> <p>Yet the point at The Maids, apparently, is not to clean so much as it is to create the appearance of having been cleaned, not to sanitise but to create a kind of stage setting for family life. And the stage setting Americans seem to prefer is sterile only in the metaphorical sense, like a motel room or the fake interiors in which soap operas take place. </p> <p> But even ritual work takes its toll on those assigned to perform it. Turnover is dizzyingly high in the cleaning-service industry, and not only because of the usual challenges that confront the working poor: childcare problems, unreliable transportation, evictions, and prior health problems. As my long-winded interviewer at Merry Maids warned me, and my co-workers at The Maids confirmed, this is a physically punishing occupation, something to tide you over for a few months, not year after year. The hands-and-knees posture damages knees, with or without pads; vacuuming strains the back; constant wiping and scrubbing invite repetitive-strain injuries even in the very young. </p> <p>In my three weeks as a maid, I suffered nothing more than a persistent muscle spasm in the right forearm, but the damage would have been far worse if I'd had to go home every day to my own housework and children, as most of my co-workers did, instead of returning to my motel and indulging in a daily after-work regimen of ice packs and stretches. Chores that seem effortless at home, even almost recreational, quickly turn nasty when performed hour after hour, with few or no breaks and under relentless time pressure. </p> <p>So far, the independent, entrepreneurial housecleaner is holding her own, but there are reasons to think that corporate cleaning services will eventually dominate the industry. New users often prefer the impersonal, standardised service offered by the chains. The trend toward outsourcing the work of the home seems, at the moment, unstoppable. For a fee, new firms will also pick up dry cleaning, babysit pets, buy groceries, deliver dinner, even do the Christmas shopping. With other firms and individuals offering to buy your clothes, organise your financial files, and wait around in your home for the plumber to show up, why would anyone want to hold on to the toilet cleaning? </p> <p>Barring a major souring of the economy, there is every reason to think that we will become increasingly reliant on paid housekeepers and that this reliance will extend ever further down into the middle class. For one thing, the 'time bind' on working parents shows no sign of loosening: people are willing to work longer hours at the office to pay for the people - housecleaners and baby-sitters - who are filling in for them at home. </p> <p>Another trend impels people to hire outside help: fewer Americans know how to clean or even to 'straighten up'. I hear this from professional women defending their decision to hire a maid: 'I'm just not very good at it myself', or 'I wouldn't really know where to begin.' Since most of us learn to clean from our parents (usually our mothers), any diminution of cleaning skills is transmitted from one generation to another. Upper-middle-class children raised in the servant economy of the 90s are bound to grow up as domestically incompetent as their parents and no less dependent on people to clean up after them. Having cleaned the rooms of many overly privileged teenagers in my stint with The Maids, I've come to the conclusion that the American overclass is raising a generation of young people who will, without constant assistance, suffocate in their own detritus. </p> <p>Almost everything we buy is the product of some other person's suffering and miserably underpaid labour. I clean my own house (though I have to admit I recently hired someone else to ready it for a short-term tenant), but I can hardly claim purity in any other area of consumption. I buy my jeans at shops which are reputed to subcontract to sweatshops. I tend to favour decorative objects no doubt ripped off from scantily paid Third World craftspersons. Like everyone else, I eat salad greens just picked by migrant farm workers, some of them possibly children. So why should housework - as I have found in conversations with liberal-minded employers of maids - arouse any special angst? </p> <p>Perhaps because we all sense that there are ways in which housework is different from other products and services. First, in its inevitable proximity to the activities that compose 'private' life. The home that becomes a workplace for other people remains a home, even when that workplace has been minutely regulated by the corporate cleaning chains. Someone who has no qualms about purchasing rugs woven by child slaves in India or coffee picked by impoverished peasants in Guatemala might still hesitate to tell dinner guests that, surprisingly enough, his or her lovely home doubles as a sweatshop during the day. You can eschew the chain-cleaning services, of course, hire an independent cleaner at a generous hourly wage, and even encourage, at least in spirit, the unionisation of the house-cleaning industry. But this does not change the fact that someone is working in your home at a job she would almost certainly never have chosen for herself - if she'd had a college education, for example, or a little better luck along the way - and the place where she works, however enthusiastically or resentfully, is the same as the place where you sleep. </p> <p>It is also the place where your children are raised, and what they learn pretty quickly is that some people are less worthy than others. Even better wages and working conditions won't erase the hierarchy between an employer and his or her domestic help, because the help is usually there only because the employer has 'something better' to do with her time, as one report on the growth of cleaning services puts it, not noticing the obvious implication that the cleaning person herself has nothing better to do with her time. In a merely middle-class home, the message may be reinforced by a warning to the children that that's what they'll end up doing if they don't try harder in school. Housework, as radical feminists once proposed, defines a human relationship and, when unequally divided among social groups, reinforces pre-existing inequalities. Dirt, in other words, tends to attach to the people who remove it. Or, as cleaning entrepreneur Don Aslett told me with some bitterness - and this is a successful man, chairman of the board of an industrial cleaning service and frequent television guest: 'The whole mentality out there is that if you clean, you're a scumball.' </p> <p> To be cleaned up after is to achieve a certain magical weightlessness and immateriality. Almost everyone complains about violent video games, but paid housecleaning has the same consequence-abolishing effect: you blast the villain into a mist of blood droplets and move right along; you drop the socks knowing they will eventually levitate, laundered and folded, back to their normal dwelling place. The result is a kind of virtual existence, in which the trail of litter that follows you seems to evaporate all by itself. Spill syrup on the floor and the cleaning person will scrub it off when she comes on Tuesday. Leave the newspaper scattered around your airplane seat and the flight attendants will deal with it after you've deplaned. Spray toxins into the atmosphere from your factory's chimneys and they will be filtered out eventually by the lungs of the breathing public. A servant economy breeds callousness and solipsism in the served, and it does so all the more effectively when the service is performed close up and routinely in the place where they live and reproduce. </p> <p>In a more generous social order, housekeeping services would be subsidised for those who have health-related reasons to need them - the old or infirm, for example. This would generate new jobs for the low-skilled people who now clean the homes of the affluent. And in a less gender-divided social order, husbands and boyfriends would more readily do their share of the chores. </p> <p>The moral challenge is, put simply, to make work visible again: not only the scrubbing and vacuuming but all the hoeing, hammering, drilling and lifting that goes into creating and maintaining a livable habitat. In an ever more economically unequal culture, where so many of the affluent devote their lives to such ghostly pursuits as stock trading, image making and opinion polling, real work - in the old-fashioned sense of labour that engages hand as well as eye, that tires the body and directly alters the physical world - tends to vanish from sight. </p> <p>The feminists of my generation tried to bring some of it into the light of day, but, like busy women fleeing the house in the morning, they left the project unfinished, the debate broken off in mid-sentence, the noble intentions unfulfilled. Sooner or later, someone else will have to finish the job.</p>",

'We scrub your floors the old-fashioned way,' boasts the brochure from Merry Maids, the largest of the residential-cleaning services that have sprung up in America in the past two decades, 'on our hands and knees.' Recently, I spent three weeks as an employee of The Maids International in Portland, Maine, cleaning, along with my fellow team members, approximately 60 houses containing a total of about 250 scrubbable floors - bathrooms, kitchens and entryways requiring the hands-and-knees treatment. It's a different world down there below knee level, one that few adults voluntarily enter. Here you find elaborate dust structures held together by a scaffolding of dog hair; dried bits of pasta glued to the floor by their sauce; the congealed remains of gravies, jellies, contraceptive creams, vomit and urine. Sometimes, too, you encounter some fragment of a human being: a child's legs, stamping by in disgust because the cleaner is still there when he gets home from school; more commonly, the electrolysed calves of the female homeowner. Look up and you may find this person staring at you, arms folded, in anticipation of an overlooked stain. In rare instances she may try to help in some vague way or apologise for the leaves shed by a miniature indoor tree. Mostly, though, she will not see you at all and may even sit down with her post at a table in the room you are cleaning, where she would remain unaware of your existence unless you were to crawl under that table and start gnawing away at her ankles. Housework, as you may recall from the feminist theories of the 60s and 70s, was supposed to be the great equaliser of women. Whatever else women did, we also did housework. If men thought of the home as a site of leisure and recreation - a 'haven in a heartless world' - this was to ignore the invisible female proletariat that kept it cosy and humming. We were on the march, or so we imagined, united against a society that devalued our labour even as it waxed mawkish over 'the family' and 'the home'. We railed against husbands and boyfriends who refused to pick up after themselves, who were unaware of housework at all, unless of course it hadn't been done. Wherever second-wave feminism took root, battles broke out between lovers and spouses over sticky countertops, piled-up laundry, and whose turn it was to do the dishes. The radical new idea was that housework was not only a relationship between a woman and a Hoover or an unmade bed; it also defined a relationship between human beings, typically husbands and wives. Hence the feminist perception of housework as one more way by which men exploit women. We rejected the servant option. There already were at least two able-bodied adults in the average home - a man and a woman - and the hope was that, after a few initial skirmishes, they would learn to share the housework graciously. A couple of decades later, however, the average household still falls far short of that goal. True, women do almost half the amount of housework they did before the feminist revolution and the rise of the two-income family - a decline that reflects a relaxation of standards rather than a redistribution of chores. Yet women still do two-thirds of whatever housework - including bill paying, pet care, tidying and lawn care - gets done. The inequity is sharpest for the most despised of household chores, cleaning: in the 30 years between 1965 and 1995, American men increased the time they spent scrubbing, vacuuming, and sweeping by 240 per cent - all the way up to 1.7 hours per week - while women decreased their cleaning time by only 7 per cent, to 6.7 hours per week. In the UK, a survey of British parents in 1996 revealed fathers spend an average of two hours cleaning per week, compared to 13.25 hours by mothers. These averages conceal a variety of arrangements, of course, from minutely negotiated sharing to the most clich\u00e9d division of labour, as described by one woman I heard of, who recently said: 'I take care of the inside, he takes care of the outside.' But perhaps the most disturbing finding is that almost the entire increase in male participation took place between the 70s and the mid-80s. Fifteen years after the apparent cessation of hostilities, it is probably not too soon to announce the score: in the 'chore wars' of the 70s and 80s, women gained a little ground, but overall, and after a few strategic concessions, men won. Enter then, the cleaning lady. Marriage counsellors recommend her as an alternative to squabbling, as do many within the cleaning industry itself. A cleaning woman quotes one of her clients as saying that if she gives up the service, 'My husband and I will be divorced in six months.' When the trend toward hiring out was just beginning to take off, in 1988, the owner of a Merry Maids franchise in Arlington, Massachusetts, said: 'I kid some women. I say, \"We even save marriages. In this new 80s period, you expect more from the male partner, but very often you don't get the co-operation you would like to have. The alternative is to pay somebody to come in...\"' Another Merry Maids franchise owner has learned to capitalise more directly on housework-related spats: he closes a third of his sales by making follow-up calls Saturday mornings, which is 'prime time for arguing over the fact that the house is a mess'. The micro-defeat of feminism in the household opened a new door for women - only this time it was the servants' entrance. The cleaning industry is booming. Among my middle-class, professional-women friends and acquaintances, including some who made important contributions to the early feminist analysis of housework, the employment of a maid is now nearly universal. Strangely, or perhaps not so strangely, no one talks about the 'politics of housework' any more. The demand for 'wages for housework' has sunk to the status of a curio. Among feminist sociologists, housework has lost much of its former cachet - in part, I suspect, because fewer sociologists actually do it. The home, or at least the affluent home, is finally becoming what radical feminists in the 70s only imagined it was - a true 'workplace' for women and a tiny, though increasingly visible, part of the capitalist economy. And the question is: as the home becomes a workplace for someone else, is it still a place where you would want to live? The 'cleaning boom' is concentrated among chains such as Merry Maids, Molly Maids, Mini Maids, Maid Brigade, and The Maids International - all named, curiously enough, to highlight the more antique aspects of the industry, though the 'maid' may occasionally be male. These corporate cleaning services have abolished the mistress-maid relationship. The customer hires the service, not the maid, who has been replaced by a team of two to four uniformed people, only one of whom - the team leader - is usually authorised to speak to the customer. The maids' wages, their taxes, their backaches, and childcare problems are all the concern of the company, meaning the local franchise owner. If there are complaints on either side, they are addressed to the franchise owner; the customer and the actual workers need never interact. Since the franchise owner is usually a middle-class white person, cleaning services are the ideal solution for anyone still sensitive enough to find the traditional employer-maid relationship morally vexing. Dan Libby, my boss at The Maids, confided to me that he could double his business overnight if only he could find enough reliable employees. To this end, The Maids offers a week's paid vacation, health insurance after 90 days and a free breakfast every morning consisting of coffee, doughnuts, bagels and bananas. Some franchises have dealt with the tight labour market by participating in welfare-to-work projects that not only funnel employees to them but often subsidise their paycheques with public money, at least for the first few months of work (which doesn't mean that the newly minted maid earns more, only that the company has to pay her less). The Merry Maids franchise in the city where I worked is conveniently located a block away from the city's welfare office. Among the women I worked with at The Maids, only one said she had previously worked as an independent, and she professed to be pleased with her new status as a cleaning-service employee. She no longer needed a car to get her from house to house and could take a day off - unpaid, of course - to stay home with a sick child without risking the loss of a customer. I myself could see the advantage of not having to deal directly with the customers, who were sometimes at home while we worked and eager to make use of their supervisory skills: criticisms of our methods, and demands that we perform unscheduled tasks, could simply be referred to the franchise owner. But there are inevitable losses for the workers as any industry moves from the entrepreneurial to the industrial phase, probably most strikingly, in this case, in the matter of pay. At Merry Maids, I was promised $200 for a 40-hour week, the manager hastening to add that 'you can't calculate it in dollars per hour' since the 40 hours include all the time spent travelling from house to house - up to five houses a day - which is unpaid. The Maids International, with its straightforward starting rate of $6.63 an hour, seemed preferable, though this rate was conditional on perfect attendance. Miss one day and your wage dropped to $6 an hour for two weeks, a rule that weighed particularly heavily on those who had young children. In addition, I soon learned that management had ways of shaving off nearly an hour's worth of wages a day. We were told to arrive at 7.30am, but our billable hours began only after we had been teamed up, given our list of houses for the day, and packed off in the company car at about 8am. At the end of the day, we were no longer paid from the moment we left the car, though as much as 15 minutes of work - refilling cleaning-fluid bottles, etc - remained to be done. So for a standard nine-hour day, the actual pay amounted to about $6.10 an hour, unless you were still being punished for an absence, in which case it came out to $5.50 an hour. Nor are cleaning-service employees likely to receive any of the perks or tips familiar to independents - free lunches and coffee, cast-off clothing or a Christmas gift of cash. When I asked, only one of my co-workers could recall ever receiving a tip, and that was a voucher for a free meal at a downtown restaurant owned by a customer. The customers of cleaning services are probably no stingier than the employers of independents; they just don't know their cleaning people and probably wouldn't even recognise them on the street. Plus, customers probably assume that the fee they pay the service - $25 per person-hour, in the case of The Maids franchise - goes largely to the workers who do the actual cleaning. The most interesting feature of the cleaning- service chains, at least from an abstract, historical perspective, is that they are finally transforming the home into a fully capitalist-style workplace, and in ways that the old wages-for-housework advocates could never have imagined. A house is an innately difficult workplace to control, especially a house with 10 or more rooms like so many of those we cleaned; workers may remain out of one another's sight for as much as an hour at a time. For independents, the ungovernable nature of the home-as-workplace means a certain amount of autonomy. They can take breaks (though this is probably ill-advised if the homeowner is on the premises); they can ease the monotony by listening to the radio or TV while they work. But cleaning services lay down rules meant to enforce a factorylike - or even conventlike - discipline on their far-flung employees. At The Maids, there were no breaks except for a daily 10-minute stop at a convenience store for coffee or 'lunch' - meaning something like a slice of pizza. Otherwise, the time spent driving between houses was considered our 'break' and the only chance to eat, drink or (although this was also officially forbidden) smoke a cigarette. When the houses were spaced well apart, I could eat my sandwich in one sitting; otherwise it would have to be divided into as many as three separate, hasty snacks. In a customer's house, nothing was to touch our lips at all, not even water - a rule that, on hot days, I sometimes broke by drinking from a bathroom tap. TVs and radios were off-limits, and we were never, ever, to curse out loud, even in an ostensibly deserted house. There might be a homeowner secreted in some locked room, we were told, ear pressed to the door, or, more likely, a tape recorder or video camera running. At the time, I dismissed this as a scare story, but I have since come across ads for devices like the Tech-7 'incredible coin-sized camera' designed to 'get a visual record of your babysitter's actions' and 'watch employees to prevent theft'. It was the threat or rumour of hidden recording devices that provided the final capitalist-industrial touch: supervision. What makes the work most factory-like, though, is the intense regimen imposed by the companies.

Second, some of the houses were already clean when we started, at least by any normal standards, thanks probably to a housekeeper who kept things up between our visits - but the absence of visible dirt did not mean there was less work to do, for no surface could ever be neglected, so it was important to have 'the system' to remind you of where you had been and what you had already 'cleaned'. No doubt the biggest advantage of the system, though, is that it helps you achieve the speed demanded by the company, which allots only so many minutes per house. After a week or two on the job, I found myself moving robotlike from surface to surface, grateful to have been relieved of the thinking process. The irony, which I was often exhausted enough to derive a certain malicious satisfaction from, is that 'the system' is not very sanitary. When I saw the training videos on 'Kitchens' and 'Bathrooms', I was at first baffled, and it took me several minutes to realise why: there is no water, or almost no water, involved. I had been taught to clean by my mother, a compulsive housekeeper who employed water so hot you needed rubber gloves to get into it and in such Niagara-like quantities that most microbes were probably crushed by the force of it before the soap suds had a chance to rupture their cell walls. But germs are never mentioned in the videos provided by The Maids. Our antagonists existed entirely in the visible world - soap scum, dust, counter crud, dog hair, stains and smears - and were attacked by damp rag or, in hardcore cases, by a scouring pad. We scrubbed only to remove impurities that might be detectable to a customer by hand or by eye; otherwise our only job was to wipe. Nothing was ever said, in the videos or in person, about the possibility of transporting bacteria from bathroom to kitchen or even from one house to the next. Instead, it is the 'cosmetic touches' that the videos emphasise and to which my trainer continually directed my eye. Fluff out all throw-pillows and arrange them symmetrically. Brighten up stainless-steel sinks with baby oil. Leave all spice jars, shampoos, etc, with their labels facing outward. Comb out the fringes of Persian carpets with a pick. Use the vacuum to create a special, fernlike pattern in the carpets. The loose ends of loo paper and paper towel rolls have to be given a special fold. Finally, the house is sprayed with the service's signature air freshener - a cloying floral scent. When I described the 'methods' employed to cleaning expert Cheryl Mendelson, she was incredulous. A rag moistened with disinfectant will not get a countertop clean, she told me, because most disinfectants are inactivated by contact with organic matter - ie, dirt - so their effectiveness declines with each swipe of the rag. What you need is a detergent and hot water, followed by a rinse. As for floors, she judged the amount of water we used - one half of a small bucket - to be grossly inadequate, and, in fact, the water I wiped around on floors was often an unsavoury gray. Yet the point at The Maids, apparently, is not to clean so much as it is to create the appearance of having been cleaned, not to sanitise but to create a kind of stage setting for family life. And the stage setting Americans seem to prefer is sterile only in the metaphorical sense, like a motel room or the fake interiors in which soap operas take place. But even ritual work takes its toll on those assigned to perform it. Turnover is dizzyingly high in the cleaning-service industry, and not only because of the usual challenges that confront the working poor: childcare problems, unreliable transportation, evictions, and prior health problems. As my long-winded interviewer at Merry Maids warned me, and my co-workers at The Maids confirmed, this is a physically punishing occupation, something to tide you over for a few months, not year after year. The hands-and-knees posture damages knees, with or without pads; vacuuming strains the back; constant wiping and scrubbing invite repetitive-strain injuries even in the very young. In my three weeks as a maid, I suffered nothing more than a persistent muscle spasm in the right forearm, but the damage would have been far worse if I'd had to go home every day to my own housework and children, as most of my co-workers did, instead of returning to my motel and indulging in a daily after-work regimen of ice packs and stretches. Chores that seem effortless at home, even almost recreational, quickly turn nasty when performed hour after hour, with few or no breaks and under relentless time pressure. So far, the independent, entrepreneurial housecleaner is holding her own, but there are reasons to think that corporate cleaning services will eventually dominate the industry. New users often prefer the impersonal, standardised service offered by the chains. The trend toward outsourcing the work of the home seems, at the moment, unstoppable. For a fee, new firms will also pick up dry cleaning, babysit pets, buy groceries, deliver dinner, even do the Christmas shopping. With other firms and individuals offering to buy your clothes, organise your financial files, and wait around in your home for the plumber to show up, why would anyone want to hold on to the toilet cleaning? Barring a major souring of the economy, there is every reason to think that we will become increasingly reliant on paid housekeepers and that this reliance will extend ever further down into the middle class. For one thing, the 'time bind' on working parents shows no sign of loosening: people are willing to work longer hours at the office to pay for the people - housecleaners and baby-sitters - who are filling in for them at home. Another trend impels people to hire outside help: fewer Americans know how to clean or even to 'straighten up'. I hear this from professional women defending their decision to hire a maid: 'I'm just not very good at it myself', or 'I wouldn't really know where to begin.' Since most of us learn to clean from our parents (usually our mothers), any diminution of cleaning skills is transmitted from one generation to another. Upper-middle-class children raised in the servant economy of the 90s are bound to grow up as domestically incompetent as their parents and no less dependent on people to clean up after them. Having cleaned the rooms of many overly privileged teenagers in my stint with The Maids, I've come to the conclusion that the American overclass is raising a generation of young people who will, without constant assistance, suffocate in their own detritus. Almost everything we buy is the product of some other person's suffering and miserably underpaid labour. I clean my own house (though I have to admit I recently hired someone else to ready it for a short-term tenant), but I can hardly claim purity in any other area of consumption. I buy my jeans at shops which are reputed to subcontract to sweatshops. I tend to favour decorative objects no doubt ripped off from scantily paid Third World craftspersons. Like everyone else, I eat salad greens just picked by migrant farm workers, some of them possibly children. So why should housework - as I have found in conversations with liberal-minded employers of maids - arouse any special angst? Perhaps because we all sense that there are ways in which housework is different from other products and services. First, in its inevitable proximity to the activities that compose 'private' life. The home that becomes a workplace for other people remains a home, even when that workplace has been minutely regulated by the corporate cleaning chains. Someone who has no qualms about purchasing rugs woven by child slaves in India or coffee picked by impoverished peasants in Guatemala might still hesitate to tell dinner guests that, surprisingly enough, his or her lovely home doubles as a sweatshop during the day. You can eschew the chain-cleaning services, of course, hire an independent cleaner at a generous hourly wage, and even encourage, at least in spirit, the unionisation of the house-cleaning industry. But this does not change the fact that someone is working in your home at a job she would almost certainly never have chosen for herself - if she'd had a college education, for example, or a little better luck along the way - and the place where she works, however enthusiastically or resentfully, is the same as the place where you sleep. It is also the place where your children are raised, and what they learn pretty quickly is that some people are less worthy than others. Even better wages and working conditions won't erase the hierarchy between an employer and his or her domestic help, because the help is usually there only because the employer has 'something better' to do with her time, as one report on the growth of cleaning services puts it, not noticing the obvious implication that the cleaning person herself has nothing better to do with her time. In a merely middle-class home, the message may be reinforced by a warning to the children that that's what they'll end up doing if they don't try harder in school. Housework, as radical feminists once proposed, defines a human relationship and, when unequally divided among social groups, reinforces pre-existing inequalities. Dirt, in other words, tends to attach to the people who remove it. Or, as cleaning entrepreneur Don Aslett told me with some bitterness - and this is a successful man, chairman of the board of an industrial cleaning service and frequent television guest: 'The whole mentality out there is that if you clean, you're a scumball.' To be cleaned up after is to achieve a certain magical weightlessness and immateriality. Almost everyone complains about violent video games, but paid housecleaning has the same consequence-abolishing effect: you blast the villain into a mist of blood droplets and move right along; you drop the socks knowing they will eventually levitate, laundered and folded, back to their normal dwelling place. The result is a kind of virtual existence, in which the trail of litter that follows you seems to evaporate all by itself. Spill syrup on the floor and the cleaning person will scrub it off when she comes on Tuesday. Leave the newspaper scattered around your airplane seat and the flight attendants will deal with it after you've deplaned. Spray toxins into the atmosphere from your factory's chimneys and they will be filtered out eventually by the lungs of the breathing public. A servant economy breeds callousness and solipsism in the served, and it does so all the more effectively when the service is performed close up and routinely in the place where they live and reproduce. In a more generous social order, housekeeping services would be subsidised for those who have health-related reasons to need them - the old or infirm, for example. This would generate new jobs for the low-skilled people who now clean the homes of the affluent. And in a less gender-divided social order, husbands and boyfriends would more readily do their share of the chores. The moral challenge is, put simply, to make work visible again: not only the scrubbing and vacuuming but all the hoeing, hammering, drilling and lifting that goes into creating and maintaining a livable habitat. In an ever more economically unequal culture, where so many of the affluent devote their lives to such ghostly pursuits as stock trading, image making and opinion polling, real work - in the old-fashioned sense of labour that engages hand as well as eye, that tires the body and directly alters the physical world - tends to vanish from sight. The feminists of my generation tried to bring some of it into the light of day, but, like busy women fleeing the house in the morning, they left the project unfinished, the debate broken off in mid-sentence, the noble intentions unfulfilled. Sooner or later, someone else will have to finish the job.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>You have got to like him, he wants you to so much. But boy, it doesn't come easily. You wince as that honeyed voice drips compliments in your ear, telling you it's so kind of you to fly all the way to Barbados to interview him. It's like having margarine massaged into your hair. You start off knowing you'll dislike him, knowing you'll resist him - and indeed you do dislike him, you do resist him - but slowly, remorselessly he wears you down, because his will to win you over is greater than your will to resist. It is the art of the seducer, and he was a great seducer in his day. But you don't necessarily feel very good about yourself afterwards. </p> <p>This is his tragedy - he wants so much to be liked, but the more he tries to be liked, the more he irritates. You think of AA Gill's remark: 'Every mannerism drips insincerity and smarm.' He knows it and is puzzled by it - 'I've tried all my life to please people and make people think I'm a nice guy.' But he's like a doorstep salesman, the more he tells you this Monkhouse product is really wonderful, reliable, harmless, good value, the more you back away saying 'Not today, thank you' and finally slam the door in his face. I believe the pattern was set in childhood - he once said of his parents, 'I didn't seem to be able to get their attention, and the more I did, the more distant they became.' </p> <p>On the face of it, he seems more normal than most comedians - not enormously fat, nor dwarfishly small, he doesn't have a high squeaky voice or a ludicrous toupee. His barbecued skin colour is explained by the fact that a) he lives much of the year in Barbados so is genuinely suntanned but b) suffers from vitiligo - white patches on the skin - which he has to cover with make-up. 'Beneath my underpants,' he tells me, 'I'm a riot of polka dots and moonbeams.' In the flesh, he seems older, meeker, smaller, tireder than on screen, but it is still hard to believe that he is 72. </p> <p>His youthfulness is the more surprising given that he drinks like a fish - two bottles of wine and half a bottle of malt whisky a day. Before he goes on stage, he likes to have 'a large one - I mean a sodding great whisky - and after I've been on stage for half an hour or 35 minutes I can feel that kick in, I get that surge from the sugar. And when I come off I go back to the booze because that's my reward.' A few years ago, he suffered an 'infarction' when his face temporarily slid south, but he was back at work within the week. He takes an enormous array of health pills and potions every day - vitamin E, and ginseng and saw palmetto and pygaeum and milk thistle and melatonin and dozens more. But not St Johns Wort or Prozac because, 'I don't need any kind of mood enhancing. I don't get depressed, I'm more or less continuously equable.' </p> <p>This is a constant refrain - that he is permanently sunny, never anxious, never depressed, never angry. He says that's why he loves Barbados - because it's 'goofy', just like him. But the more you learn about him, the more you think not quite so simple, sunshine. This is a man who used to keep more than a thousand tins of food in his house because they made him feel safe. He would eat one of them occasionally 'though it hurt me to do so', but eventually the tins started swelling like footballs and exploding - pork and gravy splattered all over the walls - so he had to chuck them. Then he moved on to bookmatches - 'which was really nerdish' - followed by films, Capo di Monte China - but only the works of Giuseppe di Capo, made between 1940 and 1962 - and original comic cartoons, Peanuts , Pogo , Blondie , Popeye and especially Krazy Kat 'which was the greatest comic strip of all time, drawn from 1911 to 1944 by George Herriman who was a genius'. He says that nowadays he doesn't really need to collect because 'I justify every breath I take by fulfilling the needs of others', but in the past it was a case of somehow validating himself with possessions - 'I collect therefore I am.' Weird, anyway. </p> <p>But, of course, what he mainly collects is jokes, millions and millions of them - he probably knows more jokes than anyone alive. He has them all written down in eleven ringbinder files and he suffered great grief a few years ago when two of the files were stolen, but he got them back eventually. Moreover, he has an eidetic memory so that, if, as he's going onstage, someone tells him there's a table of firemen to his left, he can mentally flick through his files for the section of firemen jokes written in red and recall that 'A miniature village in Bournemouth caught fire and the flames could be seen nearly three feet away'.</p> <p> This is why younger comedians worship him - he's like a walking comic reference library. I must say his gags don't do much for me, though I like his joke, 'They laughed when I said I was going to be a comedian... They're not laughing now.' He says, probably accurately, that he is not a great original comic genius like his heroes Laurel and Hardy, or WC Fields or Ken Dodd. Rather, he has a moderate talent which he has worked and worked all his life to improve. He thinks nothing of spending two years polishing a joke but when he gets it right, when he gets it perfect , he will never change it. And he never gets bored with delivering it - 'Not if it's a joy to do. If the gag is such a nifty piece of work, you can't wait to do it every night, you know.' </p> <p> The first sign that there was more to Bob Monkhouse than the wisecracking smoothie-chops that met the eye was an In the Psychiatrist's Chair he did in 1992. He has since suppressed the interview - he wouldn't let Professor Anthony Clare reproduce it in any of his books - but it was an astonishing encounter, in which he claimed his mother hated him and then broke down when Clare suggested that, on the contrary, her fierce possessiveness proved she loved him very much. The Clare interview was followed by an autobiography, Crying with Laughter , published in 1993, which was an equally devastating mix of bland showbiz anecdotes and harrowing emotional revelation spiced with semi-pornographic sexual reminiscence. Max Bygraves called it 'the sleaziest book of the year' but it was certainly a memorable one and well above the normal rut of showbiz memoirs. </p> <p>His mother didn't want him to go into showbiz because she said it was vulgar and dominated by Jews. Most comedians in those days came from working-class backgrounds, but he came from affluent Beckenham and went to Dulwich College public school. His father was a chartered accountant, a freemason and pillar of his City guild. He hoped that Bob would work in the family custard business, but Bob's only interest was comedy. He was hugely fat as a boy, unable to play games, and spent all his time in his bedroom writing gags and drawing cartoons. He published his first cartoon when he was 12 and sold a joke to Max Miller when he was 15 - by the time he left school at 17, he had quite a thriving cottage industry as a gagwriter, cartoonist and purveyor of pulp fiction. After national service in the RAF, he wangled himself an interview with the BBC and was soon appearing on radio and television as 'the British Bob Hope'. </p> <p>He would do pretty well anything to get work. He learned Yiddish so that he could do Jewish charity functions but he also joined the Freemasons because Cyril Stapleton, the conductor of the BBC Show Band, advised him to, and Stapleton was an important contact. He joined all three political parties so that he could be booked at their functions (though now that he is famous he considers it 'very unwise' to support a political party). Anyway, his efforts bore fruit and by the time he was 27 he was a star. </p> <p>But his private life was unhappy. He was his mother's favourite - but she was an emotionally frigid woman who never hugged him, and told him off for screaming when he broke his leg because 'What would the neighbours think?' When he married at 21 she wore black to his wedding and then didn't speak to him for 20 years. His marriage to a Belfast nurse quickly went sour, but he remained married for the sake of their first son Gary who was born severely handicapped by cerebral palsy. Gary couldn't hear or speak or walk, but he could communicate by drawing with his foot. They also had a second son Simon and an adopted daughter, Abigail, by whom he now has two granddaughters. </p> <p>Monkhouse was wildly promiscuous throughout his first marriage and his autobiography is full of fantastical sexual adventures - orgies with 'showgirls' and two-way mirrors and handcuffs, often with a slightly masochistic slant. In his younger years, he was famous for his collection of pornography and his appetite for blue humour - one of his old colleagues told me he was known for having 'the dirtiest mouth in showbiz, and that's saying something'. In his book, he claims to have slept with literally hundreds of girls, including one transsexual, and to have had an affair with Diana Dors, but he implies that this was only because his first wife was unfaithful - really he wanted to be monogamous. </p> <p>His first wife eventually left him in 1966, and he fell in love with his secretary, Jackie, and married her in 1973. She is a big cheerful sensible woman who is always at his side - he said it felt odd leaving Jackie for three hours to have lunch with me. Jackie, he says, changed his life. Until he fell in love with her, he thought himself to be emotionally empty, unfeeling, hollow at the core. He had so thoroughly learned to repress his emotions that they only erupted occasionally in strange physical manifestations - piles and boils and eye infections when he was anxious, or a terrible stammer from grief when his grandfather died. When his son Gary was diagnosed with cerebral palsy, he started having terrible migraines which only stopped with Gary's death in 1993; when his wife went into labour with their second son, he burped continuously till the baby was safely born. But this all changed when Jackie gave him her unconditional love - 'the intensity of that approval had a tremendously healing effect on me'. </p> <p>It was Jackie who persuaded him to write and make peace with his mother so that he was allowed to put his arms around her before she died in 1971. But in the meantime, his mother had prevented him seeing his father when he was dying, and also stirred up a long-standing estrangement from his brother John. There was, recently, a slight rapprochement when John wrote to congratulate him on his OBE in 1993, but they have basically spent all their adult lives as strangers. Now the history of family grudges has moved on to the next generation - his younger son, Simon, a teacher, doesn't speak to him and is not referred to by name anywhere in his autobiography. Monkhouse told the Mail four years ago that 'He's not married, he's not gay, he's just isolated' and went on, 'I wonder whether it may have crossed his mind that I have a limited number of years left. And perhaps he feels he should mend the bridges... Otherwise, once I'm dead, he's going to feel very bad.' It sounds like his mother's attitude - let the child come crawling for forgiveness. </p> <p>Of course, a comedian's relationship with his family must always be strange. In his second book of reminiscences, Over the Limit , published last year, Monkhouse includes a diary entry for Christmas 1994 when his daughter Abigail announces that she is pregnant. He writes: 'Our first grandchild is on the way. I tell them that this means more than the joy of grandparenthood to me - it means a whole new subject for comedy material. No one laughs.' </p> <p>Well I bet they don't, given the general tenor of his jokes about the family. Of course, many of them are standards - 'My father only hit me once - but he used a Volvo.' But some of them are a bit queasy-making, especially a routine he does about American Indian names, 'Only last week I ran into my first wife, Crazy Bitch. With her new husband, Nutless Wonder. On the way to visit her mother, Cow That Will Not Die.' Well, haha, sort of - except that his mother-in-law died by drowning herself in his swimming pool when suffering from depression so Cow That Will Not Die is peculiarly - and I do mean peculiarly - inappropriate. </p> <p>He doesn't see it. He believes that comedy exists in a bubble world completely divorced from reality. 'My entire act is a fiction. Jackie once said years ago that for every thousand insults the fictitious wife gets on television, she gets another diamond. And it's perfectly true - those jokes buy the diamond.' So is this another joke or is he saying Jackie's a gold-digger? You can't quite tell because maybe he can't tell - there is an undercurrent of anger, resentment, in many of his jokes, but he would say that's normal, that's the convention. And indeed maybe it is and maybe that's precisely what's wrong with the old-fangled comedy he represents - it paints an ugly world of downtrodden men and harridan wives and ungrateful children and vicious mothers-in-law. Even when funny, the cumulative effect is depressing and I can see that if you were a member of his family, you might want to keep it at arm's length. </p> <p>My trying to discuss this produces in him a rare flash of irritation and, for a second, the air between us crackles with hostility. Obviously, he has put me down as a stroppy feminist with a sense-of-humour bypass. But no sooner has he done it, than he moves to appease me. He quotes Tom Lehrer - a comedian I am old enough to remember - saying that 'Twenty years ago, there were all sorts of words you couldn't say in front of a girl - nowadays you can say all the words, but you mustn't say girl.' This is very typical Monkhouse. He has flicked through the filing system of his mind and found exactly the right joke to disarm me. But although I laugh, I also feel cheated - I wanted to have an argument, and he fobbed me off with a joke. </p> <p> But this is how he is - this is what his comedy is for . He must maintain his equability at all costs - no argument, no confrontation, no unpleasantness must be allowed to upset it. If necessary, this means blanking out any memories that don't fit the bill. There is a weird story in Over the Limit about how once, doing cabaret, he lost his temper with a heckler and strode into the audience and punched the man to the ground, and then carried on with his act. But he only knows he did it because people told him afterwards - he couldn't remember a thing. There is an even weirder story about how he was once hypnotised into buying a nightclub, whereby he lost a lot of money. It's as if he can't admit that he was outwitted by a conman - he prefers to believe that his mind was somehow magicked away. </p> <p>He suggested to Anthony Clare that this blanking-out started with the birth of Gary, his disabled son. He would do all the physical chores, clear up his messes, sit with him on the loo, while smiling and laughing and writing comedy routines in his head. He had to be cheerful, because otherwise he might cry. Nowadays, he does a lot of charity work with disabled children, and he says the last thing they want is sympathy, so he puts on his happy face and goes round dispensing jokes which is now such second nature he can't really switch off. But I was fascinated to see in his sitting room in Barbados, among all the smiley pictures of Bob and Jackie and his daughter and his two granddaughters (no sign of his son) one most atypical picture of Bob looking thoughtful and sad. Jackie told me it was taken at his 70th birthday party when he was unaware of the camera. 'Yes,' he says wryly, 'an emotion slipped out.' I can see why Jackie likes this photo - it's much more human than the grinning rictus of his public face - but obviously wrong for his professional image as a comedian. </p> <p>And a comedian is what he is and hopes to be till he dies. He sees no reason ever to stop - he says approvingly that when Arthur Askey had his leg amputated at 82 he told his agent that he could still play Long John Silver - 'and he meant it, that's what's so wonderful. I'm the same.' </p> <p>He is still doing Wipeout , the daytime quiz show, and hustling for a new Lottery series. And now he is bobbing up in a new unlikely guise as presenter of a BBC Choice series called Bob's DIY Film Show , intended for amateur filmmakers. It is produced by Iain Ross and a young team from BBC Scotland, and Ross says they all loved working with Bob - 'He was so hyper enthusiastic, he was up for everything and he has this amazing memory so he can do everything in one or two takes. We just had a great fun time.' Monkhouse recalls that once when he made a suggestion, the film crew all applauded and he thought they were taking the mickey, but they weren't. </p> <p>He likes working with very young people - he shares their driving energy and slightly anoraky enthusiasm. He says with amazement that some comedians seem to start flagging in their sixties - he can't imagine ever doing that. He likes to 'maintain a presence' on TV because if you drop off the box (vide Little and Large, Cannon and Ball, Keith Harris and Orville) then your cabaret bookings dry up. But what he really loves is performing to live audiences up and down the country - preferably up because northern audiences are always the best. </p> <p>His diary in Over the Limit records the sort of salesmen's shindigs that are meat and drink to him - Antler Luggage at the Belfry in Sutton Coldfield, Safeguard Systems at the Hospitality Inn, Brighton, Everest Double Glazing at the Royal Lancaster, London; InterCyber Computers at the Ramada Hotel, Heathrow.</p> <p> I said surely now he's in his seventies he doesn't have to schlep round the country doing that sort of thing, but he was aghast, 'Oh! I can't turn down work ! Because I enjoy it and, oh, the satisfaction! Just before Christmas, I worked December 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 all over the map, and I remember I was coming home walking on air . I was getting a standing ovation night after night! And that still has the same kind of kick for me as when your favourite teacher puts a big tick at the end of what you'd written.'</p> <p> Moreover, he turns up at these functions two or three hours early so he can learn all the names of key personnel and 'customise' his material. 'That's interesting work, that engages my attention enormously, much more than doing a crossword. Why other people don't do it, I do not know, because you get five times the laughs. But I occasionally talk to other comedians about this and my view is not wildly shared - a lot of them perform by rote. I don't think I could do that. The great thing about being a stand-up comic is that you are master of all you survey - provided you're not failing - you are captain of your destiny. That's a pretty euphoric state to be in, and I've never lost that feeling of sustained glee.' </p> <p>When he was a young man, both Ted Ray and Arthur Askey, whom he wrote for, told him, 'You'll never be a real comedian till you're 40.' 'And I thought Why? Because I had cracked it at 27 and I was doing well at 28, 29. I didn't know then that a laugh wasn't a commitment. I thought if someone laughed at you, that meant you'd won them. I hadn't of course, that's rubbish. And it was only at the age of about 42 or 43 that I suddenly hit form and knew exactly what I was doing and I came to realise what my relationship was with the audience - to take charge of this group of people, make them laugh, make them grateful, impress them with warmth and friendliness in a way that would mean that they would like me, not merely laugh at the jokes.' So do we like him? I fear we must.</p>",

You wince as that honeyed voice drips compliments in your ear, telling you it's so kind of you to fly all the way to Barbados to interview him. It's like having margarine massaged into your hair. You start off knowing you'll dislike him, knowing you'll resist him - and indeed you do dislike him, you do resist him - but slowly, remorselessly he wears you down, because his will to win you over is greater than your will to resist. It is the art of the seducer, and he was a great seducer in his day. But you don't necessarily feel very good about yourself afterwards. This is his tragedy - he wants so much to be liked, but the more he tries to be liked, the more he irritates. You think of AA Gill's remark: 'Every mannerism drips insincerity and smarm.' He knows it and is puzzled by it - 'I've tried all my life to please people and make people think I'm a nice guy.' But he's like a doorstep salesman, the more he tells you this Monkhouse product is really wonderful, reliable, harmless, good value, the more you back away saying 'Not today, thank you' and finally slam the door in his face. I believe the pattern was set in childhood - he once said of his parents, 'I didn't seem to be able to get their attention, and the more I did, the more distant they became.' On the face of it, he seems more normal than most comedians - not enormously fat, nor dwarfishly small, he doesn't have a high squeaky voice or a ludicrous toupee. His barbecued skin colour is explained by the fact that a) he lives much of the year in Barbados so is genuinely suntanned but b) suffers from vitiligo - white patches on the skin - which he has to cover with make-up. 'Beneath my underpants,' he tells me, 'I'm a riot of polka dots and moonbeams.' In the flesh, he seems older, meeker, smaller, tireder than on screen, but it is still hard to believe that he is 72. His youthfulness is the more surprising given that he drinks like a fish - two bottles of wine and half a bottle of malt whisky a day. Before he goes on stage, he likes to have 'a large one - I mean a sodding great whisky - and after I've been on stage for half an hour or 35 minutes I can feel that kick in, I get that surge from the sugar. And when I come off I go back to the booze because that's my reward.' A few years ago, he suffered an 'infarction' when his face temporarily slid south, but he was back at work within the week. He takes an enormous array of health pills and potions every day - vitamin E, and ginseng and saw palmetto and pygaeum and milk thistle and melatonin and dozens more. But not St Johns Wort or Prozac because, 'I don't need any kind of mood enhancing. I don't get depressed, I'm more or less continuously equable.' This is a constant refrain - that he is permanently sunny, never anxious, never depressed, never angry. He says that's why he loves Barbados - because it's 'goofy', just like him. But the more you learn about him, the more you think not quite so simple, sunshine. This is a man who used to keep more than a thousand tins of food in his house because they made him feel safe. He would eat one of them occasionally 'though it hurt me to do so', but eventually the tins started swelling like footballs and exploding - pork and gravy splattered all over the walls - so he had to chuck them. Then he moved on to bookmatches - 'which was really nerdish' - followed by films, Capo di Monte China - but only the works of Giuseppe di Capo, made between 1940 and 1962 - and original comic cartoons, Peanuts , Pogo , Blondie , Popeye and especially Krazy Kat 'which was the greatest comic strip of all time, drawn from 1911 to 1944 by George Herriman who was a genius'. He says that nowadays he doesn't really need to collect because 'I justify every breath I take by fulfilling the needs of others', but in the past it was a case of somehow validating himself with possessions - 'I collect therefore I am.' Weird, anyway. But, of course, what he mainly collects is jokes, millions and millions of them - he probably knows more jokes than anyone alive. He has them all written down in eleven ringbinder files and he suffered great grief a few years ago when two of the files were stolen, but he got them back eventually. Moreover, he has an eidetic memory so that, if, as he's going onstage, someone tells him there's a table of firemen to his left, he can mentally flick through his files for the section of firemen jokes written in red and recall that 'A miniature village in Bournemouth caught fire and the flames could be seen nearly three feet away'. This is why younger comedians worship him - he's like a walking comic reference library. I must say his gags don't do much for me, though I like his joke, 'They laughed when I said I was going to be a comedian... They're not laughing now.' He says, probably accurately, that he is not a great original comic genius like his heroes Laurel and Hardy, or WC Fields or Ken Dodd. Rather, he has a moderate talent which he has worked and worked all his life to improve. He thinks nothing of spending two years polishing a joke but when he gets it right, when he gets it perfect , he will never change it. And he never gets bored with delivering it - 'Not if it's a joy to do. If the gag is such a nifty piece of work, you can't wait to do it every night, you know.' The first sign that there was more to Bob Monkhouse than the wisecracking smoothie-chops that met the eye was an In the Psychiatrist's Chair he did in 1992. He has since suppressed the interview - he wouldn't let Professor Anthony Clare reproduce it in any of his books - but it was an astonishing encounter, in which he claimed his mother hated him and then broke down when Clare suggested that, on the contrary, her fierce possessiveness proved she loved him very much. The Clare interview was followed by an autobiography, Crying with Laughter , published in 1993, which was an equally devastating mix of bland showbiz anecdotes and harrowing emotional revelation spiced with semi-pornographic sexual reminiscence. Max Bygraves called it 'the sleaziest book of the year' but it was certainly a memorable one and well above the normal rut of showbiz memoirs. His mother didn't want him to go into showbiz because she said it was vulgar and dominated by Jews. Most comedians in those days came from working-class backgrounds, but he came from affluent Beckenham and went to Dulwich College public school. His father was a chartered accountant, a freemason and pillar of his City guild. He hoped that Bob would work in the family custard business, but Bob's only interest was comedy. He was hugely fat as a boy, unable to play games, and spent all his time in his bedroom writing gags and drawing cartoons. He published his first cartoon when he was 12 and sold a joke to Max Miller when he was 15 - by the time he left school at 17, he had quite a thriving cottage industry as a gagwriter, cartoonist and purveyor of pulp fiction. After national service in the RAF, he wangled himself an interview with the BBC and was soon appearing on radio and television as 'the British Bob Hope'. He would do pretty well anything to get work. He learned Yiddish so that he could do Jewish charity functions but he also joined the Freemasons because Cyril Stapleton, the conductor of the BBC Show Band, advised him to, and Stapleton was an important contact. He joined all three political parties so that he could be booked at their functions (though now that he is famous he considers it 'very unwise' to support a political party). Anyway, his efforts bore fruit and by the time he was 27 he was a star. But his private life was unhappy. He was his mother's favourite - but she was an emotionally frigid woman who never hugged him, and told him off for screaming when he broke his leg because 'What would the neighbours think?' When he married at 21 she wore black to his wedding and then didn't speak to him for 20 years. His marriage to a Belfast nurse quickly went sour, but he remained married for the sake of their first son Gary who was born severely handicapped by cerebral palsy. Gary couldn't hear or speak or walk, but he could communicate by drawing with his foot. They also had a second son Simon and an adopted daughter, Abigail, by whom he now has two granddaughters. Monkhouse was wildly promiscuous throughout his first marriage and his autobiography is full of fantastical sexual adventures - orgies with 'showgirls' and two-way mirrors and handcuffs, often with a slightly masochistic slant. In his younger years, he was famous for his collection of pornography and his appetite for blue humour - one of his old colleagues told me he was known for having 'the dirtiest mouth in showbiz, and that's saying something'. In his book, he claims to have slept with literally hundreds of girls, including one transsexual, and to have had an affair with Diana Dors, but he implies that this was only because his first wife was unfaithful - really he wanted to be monogamous. His first wife eventually left him in 1966, and he fell in love with his secretary, Jackie, and married her in 1973. She is a big cheerful sensible woman who is always at his side - he said it felt odd leaving Jackie for three hours to have lunch with me. Jackie, he says, changed his life. Until he fell in love with her, he thought himself to be emotionally empty, unfeeling, hollow at the core. He had so thoroughly learned to repress his emotions that they only erupted occasionally in strange physical manifestations - piles and boils and eye infections when he was anxious, or a terrible stammer from grief when his grandfather died. When his son Gary was diagnosed with cerebral palsy, he started having terrible migraines which only stopped with Gary's death in 1993; when his wife went into labour with their second son, he burped continuously till the baby was safely born. But this all changed when Jackie gave him her unconditional love - 'the intensity of that approval had a tremendously healing effect on me'. It was Jackie who persuaded him to write and make peace with his mother so that he was allowed to put his arms around her before she died in 1971. But in the meantime, his mother had prevented him seeing his father when he was dying, and also stirred up a long-standing estrangement from his brother John. There was, recently, a slight rapprochement when John wrote to congratulate him on his OBE in 1993, but they have basically spent all their adult lives as strangers. Now the history of family grudges has moved on to the next generation - his younger son, Simon, a teacher, doesn't speak to him and is not referred to by name anywhere in his autobiography. Monkhouse told the Mail four years ago that 'He's not married, he's not gay, he's just isolated' and went on, 'I wonder whether it may have crossed his mind that I have a limited number of years left. And perhaps he feels he should mend the bridges... Otherwise, once I'm dead, he's going to feel very bad.' It sounds like his mother's attitude - let the child come crawling for forgiveness. Of course, a comedian's relationship with his family must always be strange. In his second book of reminiscences, Over the Limit , published last year, Monkhouse includes a diary entry for Christmas 1994 when his daughter Abigail announces that she is pregnant. He writes: 'Our first grandchild is on the way. I tell them that this means more than the joy of grandparenthood to me - it means a whole new subject for comedy material. No one laughs.' Well I bet they don't, given the general tenor of his jokes about the family. Of course, many of them are standards - 'My father only hit me once - but he used a Volvo.' But some of them are a bit queasy-making, especially a routine he does about American Indian names, 'Only last week I ran into my first wife, Crazy Bitch. With her new husband, Nutless Wonder. On the way to visit her mother, Cow That Will Not Die.' Well, haha, sort of - except that his mother-in-law died by drowning herself in his swimming pool when suffering from depression so Cow That Will Not Die is peculiarly - and I do mean peculiarly - inappropriate. He doesn't see it. He believes that comedy exists in a bubble world completely divorced from reality. 'My entire act is a fiction. Jackie once said years ago that for every thousand insults the fictitious wife gets on television, she gets another diamond. And it's perfectly true - those jokes buy the diamond.' So is this another joke or is he saying Jackie's a gold-digger? You can't quite tell because maybe he can't tell - there is an undercurrent of anger, resentment, in many of his jokes, but he would say that's normal, that's the convention. And indeed maybe it is and maybe that's precisely what's wrong with the old-fangled comedy he represents - it paints an ugly world of downtrodden men and harridan wives and ungrateful children and vicious mothers-in-law. Even when funny, the cumulative effect is depressing and I can see that if you were a member of his family, you might want to keep it at arm's length. My trying to discuss this produces in him a rare flash of irritation and, for a second, the air between us crackles with hostility. Obviously, he has put me down as a stroppy feminist with a sense-of-humour bypass. But no sooner has he done it, than he moves to appease me. He quotes Tom Lehrer - a comedian I am old enough to remember - saying that 'Twenty years ago, there were all sorts of words you couldn't say in front of a girl - nowadays you can say all the words, but you mustn't say girl.' This is very typical Monkhouse. He has flicked through the filing system of his mind and found exactly the right joke to disarm me. But although I laugh, I also feel cheated - I wanted to have an argument, and he fobbed me off with a joke. But this is how he is - this is what his comedy is for . He must maintain his equability at all costs - no argument, no confrontation, no unpleasantness must be allowed to upset it. If necessary, this means blanking out any memories that don't fit the bill. There is a weird story in Over the Limit about how once, doing cabaret, he lost his temper with a heckler and strode into the audience and punched the man to the ground, and then carried on with his act. But he only knows he did it because people told him afterwards - he couldn't remember a thing. There is an even weirder story about how he was once hypnotised into buying a nightclub, whereby he lost a lot of money. It's as if he can't admit that he was outwitted by a conman - he prefers to believe that his mind was somehow magicked away. He suggested to Anthony Clare that this blanking-out started with the birth of Gary, his disabled son. He would do all the physical chores, clear up his messes, sit with him on the loo, while smiling and laughing and writing comedy routines in his head. He had to be cheerful, because otherwise he might cry. Nowadays, he does a lot of charity work with disabled children, and he says the last thing they want is sympathy, so he puts on his happy face and goes round dispensing jokes which is now such second nature he can't really switch off. But I was fascinated to see in his sitting room in Barbados, among all the smiley pictures of Bob and Jackie and his daughter and his two granddaughters (no sign of his son) one most atypical picture of Bob looking thoughtful and sad. Jackie told me it was taken at his 70th birthday party when he was unaware of the camera. 'Yes,' he says wryly, 'an emotion slipped out.' I can see why Jackie likes this photo - it's much more human than the grinning rictus of his public face - but obviously wrong for his professional image as a comedian. And a comedian is what he is and hopes to be till he dies. He sees no reason ever to stop - he says approvingly that when Arthur Askey had his leg amputated at 82 he told his agent that he could still play Long John Silver - 'and he meant it, that's what's so wonderful. I'm the same.' He is still doing Wipeout , the daytime quiz show, and hustling for a new Lottery series. And now he is bobbing up in a new unlikely guise as presenter of a BBC Choice series called Bob's DIY Film Show , intended for amateur filmmakers. It is produced by Iain Ross and a young team from BBC Scotland, and Ross says they all loved working with Bob - 'He was so hyper enthusiastic, he was up for everything and he has this amazing memory so he can do everything in one or two takes. We just had a great fun time.' Monkhouse recalls that once when he made a suggestion, the film crew all applauded and he thought they were taking the mickey, but they weren't. He likes working with very young people - he shares their driving energy and slightly anoraky enthusiasm. He says with amazement that some comedians seem to start flagging in their sixties - he can't imagine ever doing that. He likes to 'maintain a presence' on TV because if you drop off the box (vide Little and Large, Cannon and Ball, Keith Harris and Orville) then your cabaret bookings dry up. But what he really loves is performing to live audiences up and down the country - preferably up because northern audiences are always the best. His diary in Over the Limit records the sort of salesmen's shindigs that are meat and drink to him - Antler Luggage at the Belfry in Sutton Coldfield, Safeguard Systems at the Hospitality Inn, Brighton, Everest Double Glazing at the Royal Lancaster, London; InterCyber Computers at the Ramada Hotel, Heathrow. I said surely now he's in his seventies he doesn't have to schlep round the country doing that sort of thing, but he was aghast, 'Oh! I can't turn down work ! Because I enjoy it and, oh, the satisfaction! Just before Christmas, I worked December 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 all over the map, and I remember I was coming home walking on air . I was getting a standing ovation night after night! And that still has the same kind of kick for me as when your favourite teacher puts a big tick at the end of what you'd written.' Moreover, he turns up at these functions two or three hours early so he can learn all the names of key personnel and 'customise' his material. 'That's interesting work, that engages my attention enormously, much more than doing a crossword. Why other people don't do it, I do not know, because you get five times the laughs. But I occasionally talk to other comedians about this and my view is not wildly shared - a lot of them perform by rote. I don't think I could do that. The great thing about being a stand-up comic is that you are master of all you survey - provided you're not failing - you are captain of your destiny. That's a pretty euphoric state to be in, and I've never lost that feeling of sustained glee.' When he was a young man, both Ted Ray and Arthur Askey, whom he wrote for, told him, 'You'll never be a real comedian till you're 40.' 'And I thought Why? Because I had cracked it at 27 and I was doing well at 28, 29. I didn't know then that a laugh wasn't a commitment. I thought if someone laughed at you, that meant you'd won them. I hadn't of course, that's rubbish. And it was only at the age of about 42 or 43 that I suddenly hit form and knew exactly what I was doing and I came to realise what my relationship was with the audience - to take charge of this group of people, make them laugh, make them grateful, impress them with warmth and friendliness in a way that would mean that they would like me, not merely laugh at the jokes.' So do we like him? I fear we must.",

      "body": "<p>Nowhere is western culture more baffling than in matters of body weight. From modern medicine, the caveats have come thick and fast. In 1997, the World Health Organisation declared a global epidemic of obesity. European health experts convened in May this year in Antwerp to call for action in order to prevent a 'lost generation' of children hooked on fast foods, television and computers from developing diabetes, heart disease and cancer. In July, the Medical Research Council cautioned MPs that unless efforts were made to cut obesity, the Government's targets to reduce these diseases wouldn't be met. <br><br>The codicils from this quarter don't help: the BMA announced in June that actresses and models during the late-1990s carried a scant 10 to 15 per cent body fat (the average for healthy women is 20 to 26 per cent), concluding that such exposure to 'unachievable' goals could spur eating disorders, and adding that 'more realistic body shapes need to be shown on TV and in fashion magazines'. Be slim to be healthy. Don't be too slim to be socially acceptable. And all you need to be slim is fat, sugar and calories. That was the message in that commercial for H\u00e4agen-Dazs in which a twentysomething man and woman made love on a sofa, mingling heaping spoonfuls of Pralines &amp; Cream with the wettest of French kisses. Sex. Youth. Beauty. Ice cream? The incongruity didn't end there. The lovers are skeletons, an unlikely couple to imagine opting for a tub at the check-out counter.<br><br> I was 10 years old when I learned I was overweight. We had recently moved to London, and my mother ordered some custom-made suits for me from a tailor in Hong Kong, who specialised in mail-order finery. She sent the measurements along and, when the clothes arrived, there was a greeting from the tailor. The faltering English did little to soften its thrust: 'These are suits for your fat son. We made them special fat so he can grow extra fatty in them.' There was mild horror laced with hearty laughter at the dinner table that night.<br><br> Suddenly - and perhaps too early for my benefit - the 'big' issue was upon me. I've had to contend with being overweight for most of my 40 years. On the health side, I've been fortunate. I've suffered none of the scourges associated with the morbidly obese, which (as defined by the medical profession is anyone 100lb over their ideal weight) I gather I am. My yearly check-ups are unremarkable. My weight hasn't been an obstacle to pleasures enjoyed by the ideally trim: women haven't turned me away; I've played a good standard of tennis for 30 years; though buying clothes can be a challenge, in the competition between dessert and dressing up the winner has never been in doubt.<br><br> I am the product of a family and culture that lives to eat. My grandfather, who turns 100 in October, claims the source of his extraordinarily good health has been his refusal to eat vegetables or drink water without whisky in it. He has never exercised. His diet has been rich in saturated fats and refined grains and sugars. Despite a slight paunch, his weight has revolved around 12st 7lb for most of his life. Which isn't to say that the body image and health themes haven't been present. In my family, diets were frequently embarked upon between bouts of comprehensive bingeing. On the distaff side, the relationship to food has been ambivalent: one instance of anorexia, another of bulimia and generous helpings of crash dieting and pill popping.<br><br> My sisters have unquestionably managed their weight more consistently than I have, whereas my love of food has been singular and unequivocal. My seven years as a restaurant critic in America didn't do me any favours. My wife frets over what my appetite for eating, cooking and obsessing about food does to our time together, which might otherwise be better spent on more beneficial pursuits: she has a point. She worries that there's a limit to how much good genes can help and cautions that I shouldn't ignore my long-term health prospects: she has a point there, too. Meanwhile, my weight had recently ballooned to 21st. An exercise in futility and deprivation - that has been my experience with diets.<br><br> The so-called 'hungry high' is an oxymoron. I've tried the Scarsdale Diet, the Rotation Diet, the Atkins Diet, the Pritikin Diet, the Cambridge Diet, even the Beverly Hills Diet - mother of all crazies, truly a child of its time. In 1981, a self-anointed 'nutrition guru' named Judy Mazel theorised that by applying the enzymes in fruit according to her plan, one could lose weight. On a diet of fruit, there was little alternative. Week One's menu consisted of pineapples and two bananas on Monday; papayas and mangoes on Tuesday; papayas, pineapples and more papayas on Wednesday; watermelons all day on Thursday and again on Sunday; two bananas, dried apricots and blueberries on Friday; and prunes, strawberries and two bananas on Saturday. I tried it three times. By the week's end, I was a fruitcake. I never made it to Week Two.<br><br> I was 13 when I underwent my first fat-farm experience. My parents had travelled to a hospital in Italy to try a method that was all the rage in the 1970s, and soon after I was enrolled with my older sister. We did it again as a family, with my grandfather in tow, and in protest. I went to Rome no fewer than three times. We were informed that through an injection of a hormone extracted from a pregnant woman's urine, we could lose 21lb in 21 days. The full details were less salubrious. The human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) hormone is secreted by women during the first trimester of pregnancy. Dr A Simeons published a report in 1954 in which he observed how so-called 'fat boys' with adiposogenital dystrophy (a syndrome of undescended testicles) were helped by daily injections of the hormone. For a time, the world watched and some, like us, followed. Simeons was a poor advertisement for his method. He had died of weight-related coronary disease some years prior to my first visit to his centre of operations, Rome's Ospedale Salvatori Mundii. The regime worked insofar as I did lose 21lb. The 500 calorie-per-day diet may have had just a little to do with it.<br><br> Perhaps it can never be too emphatically said how, of all cities, Rome should be the last one in which to starve. Misery was the order of each day. A pricking needle in my buttocks was my wake-up call. Breakfast consisted of weak tea or coffee with skimmed milk plus all the saccharine I desired. Lunch was 100gm of meat, chicken or fish - boiled to a pulp - with boiled green vegetables, a single bread stick and a single piece of fruit. Dinner was a repeat of lunch. Water was the only beverage. It was abstinence, Italian-style. A wise move on the hospital's part was to have nuns serve the food, for the urge to physically assault the person serving your food was powerful. I actually fainted on one occasion. The nun gave a glucose tablet and a benediction. There was a silver lining, and it came early: two days before starting, you were encouraged to 'force feed' in order to build up what was enigmatically referred to as 'fat reserve'.<br><br> The obvious arguments - one, that we were obese, not geese, and two, that surely there was already more than enough of the latter - were never offered. Instead, we repaired to the most aromatic trattorias in nearby Trastevere and took no prisoners at the table. I should note that hCG has since been completely discredited as a treatment for obesity. Whatever weight was lost was quickly regained, usually with interest. My next big diet-centre experience was in North Carolina's Duke University Medical Centre, which has since become Diet Central for the variety of weight treatments on offer. I sampled the so-called 'rice diet'. It was a fitting appellation: rice for breakfast, rice for lunch and rice for dinner, puffed or boiled, no extras, and above all, with no salt. Patients who attended the 'Rice House' were simply the heaviest people I had ever seen in my life. I felt like a ballet dancer standing next to a fleet of barrage balloons. Some of the very largest had to be lowered like grand pianos down recesses beside staircases in order to help them make it to the dining room. Many were on respirators and the sound of wheezing breezed through the house.<br><br> The scene at the swimming pool in neighbouring Duke Towers evoked a lagoon teeming with hippos. I mislaid some 45lb, but soon found them again. The Rice House is still open for business, even on the web: <a href=\"http://www.ricediet.com. The\" target=\"_NEW\">www.ricediet.com. </a>The realm of prescription medication has for the most part been terra incognita . In the 1970s, a well-known doctor in London gave me so-called 'fat-burning' and diuretic pills that had me sweating like an ox and feeling that a heart attack was around the corner. I haven't sampled the new generation.<br><br> As for the new miracle pill, Orlistat, let the side-effect literature speak for itself: 'oily spotting, flatulence with discharge, faecal urgency, fatty or oily stool, oily evacuation, increases defecation and faecal incontinence'. 'We have a paradox,' says Dr Robert Lefever, director of the Promis Counselling Centre in London, where compulsions of every type are treated as variants of the same fundamental disorder: addiction. 'Diets don't work,' he says. 'But the only way to lose weight is to diet.' His views can seem contradictory. He sees addiction as a condition best treated by former addicts, not shrinks. He's critical of surgical treatments from the medical world to which he belongs. 'Surgeons have no place in dealing with a psychological problem. There's an awful lot of quackery, such as stomach stapling and gastric bypass.' He isn't kidding.<br><br> Hospitals offer a wide menu of grisly procedures designed to put an end to obesity - and much else besides. Two primary bariatric surgical procedures are commonly used: vertical banded gastroplasty and gastric bypass. The genesis of this none-too-modest proposal for weight loss dates back to 1969, when it was noted that near total removal of the stomach for cancer and ulcers caused patients to remain at below their normal weight. The approach involves stapling off most of the stomach, bypassing the duodenum and allowing the undigested food to pass directly into the small intestine. The weight loss occurs as the body adjusts to its new, limited capacity to absorb nutrients, for which vitamin supplements are thereafter widely prescribed. The mortality risks are deemed 'relatively low', though there is a chance of forming adhesions in the bowel, which frequently calls for more surgery.<br><br> The aftereffects are a laundry list. My favourite is the 'dumping syndrome'. After surgery, all food is emptied from the stomach pouch into the small intestine. Sweets and fatty foods irritate the small intestine, causing symptoms such as abdominal cramping, sweating, and general malaise. Eating and drinking fluids simultaneously is another way to feel the dumping syndrome; they recommend waiting half an hour between eating and drinking - for the rest of your life. Can the surgery be reversed? Yes, but the risks are greater than those braved the first time. Hippocrates gave us the recipe for weight loss 24 centuries ago - eat less and exercise more - and while for most that still holds true, perhaps it's possible that there's an even better way.<br><br> France's Michel Montignac, in his book Eat Yourself Slim, proposes a diet that aims to satisfy the passionate eater and lacks the more usual element of self-denial present in every diet I've ever tried. Rather disarmingly, when I spoke to him recently he said, 'Forget about my book before embarking on a plan, and simply eat the French way, then read my book.' Montignac, formerly obese, now trim but still a foodie, advocates eating well, regardless of caloric intake. The way to avoid putting on weight, he claims, is by classifying foods by their glucose content, which causes the body to produce high amounts of insulin to combat it, resulting in obesity. Beer, potatoes, cooked carrots, soft drinks, and pastry are out. Beef, dark chocolate, red wine, foie gras, ice cream are in, along with healthier foods such as wholemeal grains and pasta, pulses, fruit, and green vegetables.<br><br> A typical Montignac day begins with either a lipid breakfast or a carbohydrate breakfast. The lipid is less healthy, but acceptable: fried eggs, bacon, tomatoes and mushrooms. The carbohydrate breakfast offers all the wholegrain toast and sugar-free jam you want, plus cereal with skimmed milk. Fruit before any meal must be consumed on an empty stomach, waiting 15 minutes to digest.<br><br> Lunch or dinner can be either salad with goat's cheese and fillet of beef with B\u00e9arnaise sauce and saut\u00e9ed vegetables, then cheese for dessert, or brown rice with tomato coulis, salad with cottage cheese, and low-fat yogurt mixed with fructose jam. Dressings and sauces are fine, as long as they contain no sugar, honey or flour. Fats are to be avoided with carbohydrates, while refined starches and sugar in any form are banned. I haven't been stinting on any food group and have followed the plan to the letter. I have lost 1st 7lb. I've been travelling abroad with no regimen to keep me from restaurants or rich foods. It has all been dead simple. 'The way out is via the door,' said Confucius. 'Why is it that no one will use this method?' Now if I can only see it to the end.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Nowhere is western culture more baffling than in matters of body weight. From modern medicine, the caveats have come thick and fast. In 1997, the World Health Organisation declared a global epidemic of obesity. European health experts convened in May this year in Antwerp to call for action in order to prevent a 'lost generation' of children hooked on fast foods, television and computers from developing diabetes, heart disease and cancer. In July, the Medical Research Council cautioned MPs that unless efforts were made to cut obesity, the Government's targets to reduce these diseases wouldn't be met. The codicils from this quarter don't help: the BMA announced in June that actresses and models during the late-1990s carried a scant 10 to 15 per cent body fat (the average for healthy women is 20 to 26 per cent), concluding that such exposure to 'unachievable' goals could spur eating disorders, and adding that 'more realistic body shapes need to be shown on TV and in fashion magazines'. Be slim to be healthy. Don't be too slim to be socially acceptable. And all you need to be slim is fat, sugar and calories. That was the message in that commercial for H\u00e4agen-Dazs in which a twentysomething man and woman made love on a sofa, mingling heaping spoonfuls of Pralines &amp; Cream with the wettest of French kisses. Sex. Youth. Beauty. Ice cream? The incongruity didn't end there. The lovers are skeletons, an unlikely couple to imagine opting for a tub at the check-out counter. I was 10 years old when I learned I was overweight. We had recently moved to London, and my mother ordered some custom-made suits for me from a tailor in Hong Kong, who specialised in mail-order finery. She sent the measurements along and, when the clothes arrived, there was a greeting from the tailor. The faltering English did little to soften its thrust: 'These are suits for your fat son. We made them special fat so he can grow extra fatty in them.' There was mild horror laced with hearty laughter at the dinner table that night. Suddenly - and perhaps too early for my benefit - the 'big' issue was upon me. I've had to contend with being overweight for most of my 40 years. On the health side, I've been fortunate. I've suffered none of the scourges associated with the morbidly obese, which (as defined by the medical profession is anyone 100lb over their ideal weight) I gather I am. My yearly check-ups are unremarkable. My weight hasn't been an obstacle to pleasures enjoyed by the ideally trim: women haven't turned me away; I've played a good standard of tennis for 30 years; though buying clothes can be a challenge, in the competition between dessert and dressing up the winner has never been in doubt. I am the product of a family and culture that lives to eat. My grandfather, who turns 100 in October, claims the source of his extraordinarily good health has been his refusal to eat vegetables or drink water without whisky in it. He has never exercised. His diet has been rich in saturated fats and refined grains and sugars. Despite a slight paunch, his weight has revolved around 12st 7lb for most of his life. Which isn't to say that the body image and health themes haven't been present. In my family, diets were frequently embarked upon between bouts of comprehensive bingeing. On the distaff side, the relationship to food has been ambivalent: one instance of anorexia, another of bulimia and generous helpings of crash dieting and pill popping. My sisters have unquestionably managed their weight more consistently than I have, whereas my love of food has been singular and unequivocal. My seven years as a restaurant critic in America didn't do me any favours. My wife frets over what my appetite for eating, cooking and obsessing about food does to our time together, which might otherwise be better spent on more beneficial pursuits: she has a point. She worries that there's a limit to how much good genes can help and cautions that I shouldn't ignore my long-term health prospects: she has a point there, too. Meanwhile, my weight had recently ballooned to 21st. An exercise in futility and deprivation - that has been my experience with diets. The so-called 'hungry high' is an oxymoron. I've tried the Scarsdale Diet, the Rotation Diet, the Atkins Diet, the Pritikin Diet, the Cambridge Diet, even the Beverly Hills Diet - mother of all crazies, truly a child of its time. In 1981, a self-anointed 'nutrition guru' named Judy Mazel theorised that by applying the enzymes in fruit according to her plan, one could lose weight. On a diet of fruit, there was little alternative. Week One's menu consisted of pineapples and two bananas on Monday; papayas and mangoes on Tuesday; papayas, pineapples and more papayas on Wednesday; watermelons all day on Thursday and again on Sunday; two bananas, dried apricots and blueberries on Friday; and prunes, strawberries and two bananas on Saturday. I tried it three times. By the week's end, I was a fruitcake. I never made it to Week Two. I was 13 when I underwent my first fat-farm experience. My parents had travelled to a hospital in Italy to try a method that was all the rage in the 1970s, and soon after I was enrolled with my older sister. We did it again as a family, with my grandfather in tow, and in protest. I went to Rome no fewer than three times. We were informed that through an injection of a hormone extracted from a pregnant woman's urine, we could lose 21lb in 21 days. The full details were less salubrious. The human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) hormone is secreted by women during the first trimester of pregnancy. Dr A Simeons published a report in 1954 in which he observed how so-called 'fat boys' with adiposogenital dystrophy (a syndrome of undescended testicles) were helped by daily injections of the hormone. For a time, the world watched and some, like us, followed. Simeons was a poor advertisement for his method. He had died of weight-related coronary disease some years prior to my first visit to his centre of operations, Rome's Ospedale Salvatori Mundii. The regime worked insofar as I did lose 21lb. The 500 calorie-per-day diet may have had just a little to do with it. Perhaps it can never be too emphatically said how, of all cities, Rome should be the last one in which to starve. Misery was the order of each day. A pricking needle in my buttocks was my wake-up call. Breakfast consisted of weak tea or coffee with skimmed milk plus all the saccharine I desired. Lunch was 100gm of meat, chicken or fish - boiled to a pulp - with boiled green vegetables, a single bread stick and a single piece of fruit. Dinner was a repeat of lunch. Water was the only beverage. It was abstinence, Italian-style. A wise move on the hospital's part was to have nuns serve the food, for the urge to physically assault the person serving your food was powerful. I actually fainted on one occasion. The nun gave a glucose tablet and a benediction. There was a silver lining, and it came early: two days before starting, you were encouraged to 'force feed' in order to build up what was enigmatically referred to as 'fat reserve'. The obvious arguments - one, that we were obese, not geese, and two, that surely there was already more than enough of the latter - were never offered. Instead, we repaired to the most aromatic trattorias in nearby Trastevere and took no prisoners at the table. I should note that hCG has since been completely discredited as a treatment for obesity. Whatever weight was lost was quickly regained, usually with interest. My next big diet-centre experience was in North Carolina's Duke University Medical Centre, which has since become Diet Central for the variety of weight treatments on offer. I sampled the so-called 'rice diet'. It was a fitting appellation: rice for breakfast, rice for lunch and rice for dinner, puffed or boiled, no extras, and above all, with no salt. Patients who attended the 'Rice House' were simply the heaviest people I had ever seen in my life. I felt like a ballet dancer standing next to a fleet of barrage balloons. Some of the very largest had to be lowered like grand pianos down recesses beside staircases in order to help them make it to the dining room. Many were on respirators and the sound of wheezing breezed through the house. The scene at the swimming pool in neighbouring Duke Towers evoked a lagoon teeming with hippos. I mislaid some 45lb, but soon found them again. The Rice House is still open for business, even on the web: www.ricediet.com. The realm of prescription medication has for the most part been terra incognita . In the 1970s, a well-known doctor in London gave me so-called 'fat-burning' and diuretic pills that had me sweating like an ox and feeling that a heart attack was around the corner. I haven't sampled the new generation. As for the new miracle pill, Orlistat, let the side-effect literature speak for itself: 'oily spotting, flatulence with discharge, faecal urgency, fatty or oily stool, oily evacuation, increases defecation and faecal incontinence'. 'We have a paradox,' says Dr Robert Lefever, director of the Promis Counselling Centre in London, where compulsions of every type are treated as variants of the same fundamental disorder: addiction. 'Diets don't work,' he says. 'But the only way to lose weight is to diet.' His views can seem contradictory. He sees addiction as a condition best treated by former addicts, not shrinks. He's critical of surgical treatments from the medical world to which he belongs. 'Surgeons have no place in dealing with a psychological problem. There's an awful lot of quackery, such as stomach stapling and gastric bypass.' He isn't kidding. Hospitals offer a wide menu of grisly procedures designed to put an end to obesity - and much else besides. Two primary bariatric surgical procedures are commonly used: vertical banded gastroplasty and gastric bypass. The genesis of this none-too-modest proposal for weight loss dates back to 1969, when it was noted that near total removal of the stomach for cancer and ulcers caused patients to remain at below their normal weight. The approach involves stapling off most of the stomach, bypassing the duodenum and allowing the undigested food to pass directly into the small intestine. The weight loss occurs as the body adjusts to its new, limited capacity to absorb nutrients, for which vitamin supplements are thereafter widely prescribed. The mortality risks are deemed 'relatively low', though there is a chance of forming adhesions in the bowel, which frequently calls for more surgery. The aftereffects are a laundry list. My favourite is the 'dumping syndrome'. After surgery, all food is emptied from the stomach pouch into the small intestine. Sweets and fatty foods irritate the small intestine, causing symptoms such as abdominal cramping, sweating, and general malaise. Eating and drinking fluids simultaneously is another way to feel the dumping syndrome; they recommend waiting half an hour between eating and drinking - for the rest of your life. Can the surgery be reversed? Yes, but the risks are greater than those braved the first time. Hippocrates gave us the recipe for weight loss 24 centuries ago - eat less and exercise more - and while for most that still holds true, perhaps it's possible that there's an even better way. France's Michel Montignac, in his book Eat Yourself Slim, proposes a diet that aims to satisfy the passionate eater and lacks the more usual element of self-denial present in every diet I've ever tried. Rather disarmingly, when I spoke to him recently he said, 'Forget about my book before embarking on a plan, and simply eat the French way, then read my book.' Montignac, formerly obese, now trim but still a foodie, advocates eating well, regardless of caloric intake. The way to avoid putting on weight, he claims, is by classifying foods by their glucose content, which causes the body to produce high amounts of insulin to combat it, resulting in obesity. Beer, potatoes, cooked carrots, soft drinks, and pastry are out. Beef, dark chocolate, red wine, foie gras, ice cream are in, along with healthier foods such as wholemeal grains and pasta, pulses, fruit, and green vegetables. A typical Montignac day begins with either a lipid breakfast or a carbohydrate breakfast. The lipid is less healthy, but acceptable: fried eggs, bacon, tomatoes and mushrooms. The carbohydrate breakfast offers all the wholegrain toast and sugar-free jam you want, plus cereal with skimmed milk. Fruit before any meal must be consumed on an empty stomach, waiting 15 minutes to digest. Lunch or dinner can be either salad with goat's cheese and fillet of beef with B\u00e9arnaise sauce and saut\u00e9ed vegetables, then cheese for dessert, or brown rice with tomato coulis, salad with cottage cheese, and low-fat yogurt mixed with fructose jam. Dressings and sauces are fine, as long as they contain no sugar, honey or flour. Fats are to be avoided with carbohydrates, while refined starches and sugar in any form are banned. I haven't been stinting on any food group and have followed the plan to the letter. I have lost 1st 7lb. I've been travelling abroad with no regimen to keep me from restaurants or rich foods. It has all been dead simple. 'The way out is via the door,' said Confucius. 'Why is it that no one will use this method?' Now if I can only see it to the end.",

      "body": "<p><strong> Not the News at Ten</strong><br> Victory at last for BBC journalists who resisted attempts by Tony 'Head Prefect' Hall to rebrand the Nine O'Clock News as the 'BBC News at Nine'. Greg Dyke is expected to use his MacTaggart speech in Edinburgh this week to confirm that the programme will move to 10pm. </p> <p>But calling it BBC News at Ten is impossible. ITN owns the rights to the News at Ten name and has just revived the title on its new digital 24-hour news channel. So what will Dyke's new offering be called? Roll credits - and cheering in the gallery - for the Ten O'Clock News. Inspired and on its own worth the cost of the licence fee. </p> <p><strong> Aura of excess</strong><br> Anyone surprised by recent revelations surrounding Aura, the now defunct women's magazine run by ex-Sunday Express and Sunday Mirror editor Eve Pollard's Parkhill Publishing, clearly doesn't know La Bollard. While some people's jaws may have dropped at suggestions that Eve had a somewhat imperious approach to management, her larger-than-life style is legendary among hacks who've worked for the exemplary campaigner for Women in Journalism. One former Sunday Express city editor was once ordered to pick up a new video machine in La Bollard's chauffeur-driven car and install it at her London pad. </p> <p>Sensing a scoop, he was only too happy to oblige. The device was installed in record time, ready to receive what the poor hack thought would be a video of shady shenanigans in the Square Mile. Alas, secret film of City goings-on there was none. But like Eve's many fetchers of make-up and fresh apples, said city editor did prove himself in tune with the boss's whims. </p> <p> <strong> Deep Timidity Indicated</strong><br> Rumours continue to swirl that the Slickers, those very ex-Mirror tipsters, have been interviewed or arrested by the Old Bill during the Department of Trade and Industry's inquiry into share dealings at the tabloid. Not true. Nor is the DTI likely to see them before the autumn. Chief Slicker Boyhrul and his legal eagle are going on hols and sidekick James Hipwell is, sadly, waiting for a kidney transplant. Meanwhile, the DTI has taken soundings from not one, but three eminent law firms. One is said to be for a prosecution, one against and one undecided. Surely the DTI isn't behaving like a rabbit in headlights - yet again? </p> <p><strong> JSP goes AWOL </strong><br> Don't ever let it be said that media diary thinks it's above helping out a rival paper in times of need. So here goes. Janet, you're supposed to turn up to work on Saturdays - that's what being the editor of the Sindie is all about. Staff say that JSP's increasing absence on the day her paper goes to print is prompting serious concern at Canary Wharf. Jan Thompson, managing editor of the Independent and its Sunday stablemate, is said to be 'more than miffed'. Oh dear.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Not the News at Ten Victory at last for BBC journalists who resisted attempts by Tony 'Head Prefect' Hall to rebrand the Nine O'Clock News as the 'BBC News at Nine'. Greg Dyke is expected to use his MacTaggart speech in Edinburgh this week to confirm that the programme will move to 10pm. But calling it BBC News at Ten is impossible. ITN owns the rights to the News at Ten name and has just revived the title on its new digital 24-hour news channel. So what will Dyke's new offering be called? Roll credits - and cheering in the gallery - for the Ten O'Clock News. Inspired and on its own worth the cost of the licence fee. Aura of excess Anyone surprised by recent revelations surrounding Aura, the now defunct women's magazine run by ex-Sunday Express and Sunday Mirror editor Eve Pollard's Parkhill Publishing, clearly doesn't know La Bollard. While some people's jaws may have dropped at suggestions that Eve had a somewhat imperious approach to management, her larger-than-life style is legendary among hacks who've worked for the exemplary campaigner for Women in Journalism. One former Sunday Express city editor was once ordered to pick up a new video machine in La Bollard's chauffeur-driven car and install it at her London pad. Sensing a scoop, he was only too happy to oblige. The device was installed in record time, ready to receive what the poor hack thought would be a video of shady shenanigans in the Square Mile. Alas, secret film of City goings-on there was none. But like Eve's many fetchers of make-up and fresh apples, said city editor did prove himself in tune with the boss's whims. Deep Timidity Indicated Rumours continue to swirl that the Slickers, those very ex-Mirror tipsters, have been interviewed or arrested by the Old Bill during the Department of Trade and Industry's inquiry into share dealings at the tabloid. Not true. Nor is the DTI likely to see them before the autumn. Chief Slicker Boyhrul and his legal eagle are going on hols and sidekick James Hipwell is, sadly, waiting for a kidney transplant. Meanwhile, the DTI has taken soundings from not one, but three eminent law firms. One is said to be for a prosecution, one against and one undecided. Surely the DTI isn't behaving like a rabbit in headlights - yet again? JSP goes AWOL Don't ever let it be said that media diary thinks it's above helping out a rival paper in times of need. So here goes. Janet, you're supposed to turn up to work on Saturdays - that's what being the editor of the Sindie is all about. Staff say that JSP's increasing absence on the day her paper goes to print is prompting serious concern at Canary Wharf. Jan Thompson, managing editor of the Independent and its Sunday stablemate, is said to be 'more than miffed'. Oh dear.",

And, rightly, it will be kept as a valuable third-tier source of capital for fledgling companies when the Stock Exchange merges with the Deutsche B\u00f6rse to create the iX international exchange. </p> <p>Never mind the occasional sneering about the quality, just feel the quantity. More than 600 firms have come to Aim in its five-year existence. In all, more than \u00a35 billion of equity has been raised - \u00a32.2bn this year alone - and on better terms than typical venture capital. Fewer than 20 Aim firms have gone bust or exited in disgrace, a surprisingly good record for such a risky, start-up market. </p> <p>Enviable though that record is, it is no reason for complacency. True, on Aim caveat emptor rules. But it is also a disclosure-based mar ket, which places great responsibility on directors and nominated advisers ('nomads') to keep investors properly informed. When those duties go unfulfilled it is important to act and be seen to act to preserve confidence in the fledgling market. </p> <p>At the start of the year Aim officials were worried by the risks posed by a flood of shell internet firms coming to market. In turn, nomads politely declined to sponsor a number of dotcom wonders. One 'internet incubator' which arrived in December was Jellyworks, whose shares leapt an amazing twentyfold on its debut. </p> <p>Jellyworks was hard to grasp from the start. It intended to operate out of Guernsey, but switched at the last minute to London. It came to market not with a large portfolio, but an option over internet shares owned by trusts of veteran City investor David 'Spotty' Rowland. The option structure, co-founder Ed Guinan explained to us, was aimed at avoiding an accountants' lengthy valuation of the portfolio. Despite the hype, from the outset with Jellyworks you didn't quite know what you were getting for your money. </p> <p>Then in February, with amazing haste, Guinan quit. At the time, he walked away from a \u00a320m profit on share options, but the reasons why he should do so were never explained. Further digging revealed that Guinan's business record was hardly glittering. He was in dispute with his last company, which had terminated his contract. Another he had been involved with was struck off and dissolved last year. Never mind, the companies' names were disclosed in Jellyworks' Aim prospectus and there's no obligation under Aim rules to disclose sackings or strikings-off (so, officials, please tighten the wording). </p> <p>The rules are very specific, however, in obliging firms to disclose share options granted to directors. And here in March - in granting 2 million options to chief executive Jonathan Rowland and 1 million to chairman Graham Robeson - Jellyworks slipped up. If this 'oversight' were the only cause for concern, it would not matter so much. But it is not. </p> <p>Announcements by the firm also gave the impression that Jellyworks had more cash than it had. In particular, \u20ac20m stated to have been loaned to it by the Rowland trusts was, in fact, not loaned. Jellyworks' nomad Nabarro Wells now admits the announcement was 'badly worded'. But it was not corrected. Nor, indeed, were grand announcements about partnerships with German broker VMR - Jellyworks' biggest investment - which later did not go ahead. </p> <p>There are other new little facts about Jellyworks that rankle. Like the \u00a3714,000 it spent in its short life on its premises under a 10 year lease from Starmount, a related company. Jellyworks, remember, was a tiny band of people picking internet stocks not a Mercury Asset Management. Those lease improvements will now be written off and a further \u00a3470,000 paid to terminate the lease, which was only taken shortly after its flotation and, therefore, not disclosed in Jellyworks' Aim admission document. Creditably, however, during the Shore Capital takeover lawyers insisted that the lease termination payment be subject to shareholders' approval at a special meeting. </p> <p>That perception accords closely with reality in key areas: like directors' interests, a firm's financial position and its overall strategy -are a fundamental concern of regulators for Aim companies generally. Another is transparency when it comes to dealings with related parties be it in day-to-day business affairs, significant transactions or share issues. </p> <p>For the most part, Aim officials have used private persuasion and secret fines to regulate the market. Powers of public censure have rarely been used and then only at the start. From time to time, however, pour encourager les autres , it is important that they are. True, Jellyworks was taken over last week. But this is not to urge Aim to shut the door after the horse has bolted, as it still has jurisdiction over directors and nomads. </p> <p>And the moral for Aim investors? Examine nomads' and directors' track records, for sure. And heed the warning signals, not the hype. </p> <p><strong> Diageo's high spirits over Seagram raid</strong><br> So the race for Seagram's spirits brands is on in earnest. Diageo's cheeky three-paragraph announcement on Friday of a joint bid with Pernod Ricard succeeded in its aims. </p> <p> First, it told Seagram and the world it was serious and neither just a stalking horse, nor on a fishing expedition. And Diageo raised the pressure on Allied Domecq, its main rival. </p> <p> Diageo's main interest is in Captain Morgan, Canada's Crown Royal and Seagram's wines. The French, meanwhile, want the scotch, including Chivas Regal and Glenlivet. Seagram's tail of lesser brands will be parked in a joint venture to be dealt with later, like the Absolut vodka rights. It's a neat solution, which will probably see Diageo paying up to 60 per cent of Seagram's sale price. </p> <p>Allied, meanwhile, really needs the lot. There's still a question mark over other potential bidders. Bacardi was ditched by Diageo but may yet team up with Brown Forman of the US. There are venture capitalists, too, and possibly the big brewers. But for now the auction looks a mainly British affair. </p> <p>Fears that it will overpay will continue to dog Allied's shares. The intriguing question, though, is what happens if it loses. Failing another deal, Allied may well become a target itself.</p>",

There are other new little facts about Jellyworks that rankle. Like the \u00a3714,000 it spent in its short life on its premises under a 10 year lease from Starmount, a related company. Jellyworks, remember, was a tiny band of people picking internet stocks not a Mercury Asset Management. Those lease improvements will now be written off and a further \u00a3470,000 paid to terminate the lease, which was only taken shortly after its flotation and, therefore, not disclosed in Jellyworks' Aim admission document. Creditably, however, during the Shore Capital takeover lawyers insisted that the lease termination payment be subject to shareholders' approval at a special meeting. That perception accords closely with reality in key areas: like directors' interests, a firm's financial position and its overall strategy -are a fundamental concern of regulators for Aim companies generally. Another is transparency when it comes to dealings with related parties be it in day-to-day business affairs, significant transactions or share issues. For the most part, Aim officials have used private persuasion and secret fines to regulate the market. Powers of public censure have rarely been used and then only at the start. From time to time, however, pour encourager les autres , it is important that they are. True, Jellyworks was taken over last week. But this is not to urge Aim to shut the door after the horse has bolted, as it still has jurisdiction over directors and nomads. And the moral for Aim investors? Examine nomads' and directors' track records, for sure. And heed the warning signals, not the hype. Diageo's high spirits over Seagram raid So the race for Seagram's spirits brands is on in earnest. Diageo's cheeky three-paragraph announcement on Friday of a joint bid with Pernod Ricard succeeded in its aims. First, it told Seagram and the world it was serious and neither just a stalking horse, nor on a fishing expedition. And Diageo raised the pressure on Allied Domecq, its main rival. Diageo's main interest is in Captain Morgan, Canada's Crown Royal and Seagram's wines. The French, meanwhile, want the scotch, including Chivas Regal and Glenlivet. Seagram's tail of lesser brands will be parked in a joint venture to be dealt with later, like the Absolut vodka rights. It's a neat solution, which will probably see Diageo paying up to 60 per cent of Seagram's sale price. Allied, meanwhile, really needs the lot. There's still a question mark over other potential bidders. Bacardi was ditched by Diageo but may yet team up with Brown Forman of the US. There are venture capitalists, too, and possibly the big brewers. But for now the auction looks a mainly British affair. Fears that it will overpay will continue to dog Allied's shares. The intriguing question, though, is what happens if it loses. Failing another deal, Allied may well become a target itself.",

'It's sensible to stand back and look at the international picture,' says Oswald. </p> <p>'Politicians in all countries are trying to take credit, but all industrialised countries are going through this.

Why did spiralling consumer demand in the Irish Republic not prevent the first fall in sales of Guinness in the company's 241-year history?

'Guinness, despite all its advertising, hasn't been able to hold market share.' </p> <p>As part of a cost-cutting exercise, Guinness's parent company, Diageo, is now looking to move the Dundalk plant to Northern Ireland. The move comes as Guinness reviews all its operations in Ireland in the face of cutthroat competition in a shrinking beer market. </p> <p>Kane is right. People are switching from beer to lager, wine and spirits - a trend not unnoticed by the big drinks firms, which are scrambling to develop their market share. </p> <p>Last Friday, Diageo announced it was teaming up with Pernod Ricard to make a joint bid for Seagram's wines and spirits division, valued at around \u00a34.5 billion. The business, which boasts brands such as Chivas Regal scotch, Martell cognac and Captain Morgan rum, also interests Allied Domecq. </p> <p>So what does this mean for Guinness? According to Pearse McCabe, strategist with the Fitch brand and design consultancy, the challenge is to 'achieve the dream of retaining their core audience - the old bloke in a pub - and attracting a younger audience.' </p> <p>Guinness is clearly looking to do this. Tom Innes, editor of Flavour , the UK-based bar trade magazine, says: 'Guinness is trying to adapt to changing circumstances such as the growth of trendy bars. To combat that, it is heavily promoting draught Guinness in bottles .' </p> <p>The company has also introduced Guinness Extra Cold, which is served two degrees cooler than its normal stout. Lyndsey Sexton, spokeswoman for Guinness UK, says: 'Research showed that people saw Guinness as warm. A lot of work went into how we could respond to that. Now all of a sudden you're getting people treating it as a session beer, rather than drinking one pint and moving on to something else.' </p> <p>The repositioning of the brand has been boosted by a huge marketing campaign. During last year's Rugby World Cup alone, Guinness spent \u00a316 million promoting the black stuff. And although all this may not be working so well in Ireland, it has helped boost the stout's share of the UK beer market from 5 per cent in 1998 to 5.5 per cent now. But this is at a time when competition in the UK's \u00a31bn stout market is weak. </p> <p>Innes of Flavour adds: 'Guinness is helped at the moment by the weaknesses of the other brands. Scottish Courage is not doing much with Beamish. Murphy's was quite promoted but there was uncertainty over the sale of Whitbread's brewing arm [owner of Murphy's]. St Patrick's Day was just left to Guinness this year.' </p> <p>Guinness is aware that it cannot afford to be complacent. Publican newspaper last week unveiled its annual survey asking landlords which three beers they would most like to stock. Last year, Guinness was on the wishlist of 30 per cent of the UK's publicans. This year the figure has fallen to 24 per cent. </p> <p>One solution may be to draw on the strength of the Guinness brand - which the company says is recognised by 99 per cent of consumers - and use it to move into new areas. In Ireland the company has launched a white beer called Brio, which is designed to compete with the fashionable influx of continental speciality lagers such as Hoegaarden. </p> <p>Such a brand metamorphosis would have seemed unthinkable only a few years ago.

Philippine President Joseph Estrada has ordered that all the hostages must be released together.</p> <p>It is not clear how many people the Abu Sayyaf are still holding. Some sources say it could be as many as 19. It is known that two Germans, two Finns, two South Africans and six French are among the prisoners.</p> <p>Azzarouq said that during six-and-a-half hours of talks, the Abu Sayyaf offered him two male European hostages of his choice as a sign of their goodwill but he turned them down. 'It's all or nothing,' he said, adding that there was now no timeframe for their release. 'We will have to renegotiate for the hostages' freedom,' Azzarouq said. The Libyan has taken an increasingly prominent role in recent weeks since his leader Muammar Gadaffi offered to pay $25 million for the hostages' release.</p> <p>An aide to chief Philippine government negotiator Robert Aventajado said the hostage takers were afraid that if the prisoners were released all at once, the Philippine military would immediately launch a major offensive against them. Thousands of troops have been on a high state of readiness in the area for weeks and the only reason they have not attacked is the presence of the foreigners.</p> <p>He could not comment on the current state of the hostages' health. They have all been suffering depression and deteriorating physical health because of the strain of their ordeal as well as inadequate food and insufficient medical supplies. Some have written about being on the verge of suicide.</p> <p>'We were so optimistic that it would all end today,' one European official said. 'It seems we are now back at the beginning, at square one.'</p> <p>There was also no word yesterday on the whereabouts of four hostages, three Malaysians and one Filipino, reportedly freed on Friday but unable to cross over to the Philippine army lines.</p> <p>The crisis began on Easter Sunday, 23 April, when 21 tourists, hotel staff and forest rangers were seized on the luxury Malaysian resort island of Sipaden and taken to Jolo. At least another 18 people have been seized since then, including several foreign journalists covering the protracted dispute.</p> <p>Some Abu Sayyaf leaders initially demanded a separate Muslim state in exchange for the hostages but in the last two months it became increasingly clear that the only serious demand was for at least one million dollars for each hostage.</p> <p>Of the original hostages, six Malaysians, one Filipino and one sick German woman have been freed at various stages. Philippine armed forces commander General Angelo Reyes has admitted that at least \u00a33m was paid for their release, although all the governments involved proclaimed a firm policy that no ransoms would be paid.</p> <p>Abu Sayyaf has also released a German journalist, reportedly for a one million dollar ransom. Three of the remaining French hostages are a TV crew who thought they had secured an exclusive interview with the hostages and their captors but were not allowed to leave the camp.</p> <p>As a result of receiving so much money, the Abu Sayyaf has seen its ranks swell from fewer than 100 fighters to more than 3,000 members. It is a splinter group of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front that has been fighting for a separate Islamic state in the southern Philippines for more than two decades.</p>",

Azzarouq said that during six-and-a-half hours of talks, the Abu Sayyaf offered him two male European hostages of his choice as a sign of their goodwill but he turned them down. 'It's all or nothing,' he said, adding that there was now no timeframe for their release. 'We will have to renegotiate for the hostages' freedom,' Azzarouq said. The Libyan has taken an increasingly prominent role in recent weeks since his leader Muammar Gadaffi offered to pay $25 million for the hostages' release. An aide to chief Philippine government negotiator Robert Aventajado said the hostage takers were afraid that if the prisoners were released all at once, the Philippine military would immediately launch a major offensive against them. Thousands of troops have been on a high state of readiness in the area for weeks and the only reason they have not attacked is the presence of the foreigners. He could not comment on the current state of the hostages' health. They have all been suffering depression and deteriorating physical health because of the strain of their ordeal as well as inadequate food and insufficient medical supplies. Some have written about being on the verge of suicide. 'We were so optimistic that it would all end today,' one European official said. 'It seems we are now back at the beginning, at square one.' There was also no word yesterday on the whereabouts of four hostages, three Malaysians and one Filipino, reportedly freed on Friday but unable to cross over to the Philippine army lines. The crisis began on Easter Sunday, 23 April, when 21 tourists, hotel staff and forest rangers were seized on the luxury Malaysian resort island of Sipaden and taken to Jolo. At least another 18 people have been seized since then, including several foreign journalists covering the protracted dispute. Some Abu Sayyaf leaders initially demanded a separate Muslim state in exchange for the hostages but in the last two months it became increasingly clear that the only serious demand was for at least one million dollars for each hostage. Of the original hostages, six Malaysians, one Filipino and one sick German woman have been freed at various stages. Philippine armed forces commander General Angelo Reyes has admitted that at least \u00a33m was paid for their release, although all the governments involved proclaimed a firm policy that no ransoms would be paid. Abu Sayyaf has also released a German journalist, reportedly for a one million dollar ransom. Three of the remaining French hostages are a TV crew who thought they had secured an exclusive interview with the hostages and their captors but were not allowed to leave the camp. As a result of receiving so much money, the Abu Sayyaf has seen its ranks swell from fewer than 100 fighters to more than 3,000 members. It is a splinter group of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front that has been fighting for a separate Islamic state in the southern Philippines for more than two decades.",

In the absence of any coherent explanation for the government's refusal to extend anti-viral treatment to expectant mothers who are HIV positive, Mbeki is being accused of having taken a decision to kill the babies by way of an act of omission rather than to burden the country with orphans. The failure to act against mother-to-child infections is only one facet of the South African government's baffling approach to the epidemic - which includes a continued refusal by Mbeki to extend anti-viral treatment to rape victims, as well as his government's failure to provide such treatment for the infected general population. It is becoming apparent that the explanation for these seemingly perverse policies lies in South Africa's state of denial over Aids.

Soon, with the discovery of montage, crosscutting and the flashback, the new language and grammar of film developed. By 1956, Stanley Kubrick's The Killing could jolt an audience by reverting to the primitive technique of turning back in time to show the roles of different participants during the course of a complex racetrack robbery. </p> <p>There has, however, always been the possibility of simultaneous action being presented simultaneously by multiplying the images - Abel Gance experimented with a triple screen in Napoleon during the silent era; the short-lived Circlerama process had the audience promenading in an arena surrounded by a panorama of images; during the Sixties, a number of mainstream pictures (Frankenheimer's Grand Prix and Jewison's The Thomas Crown Affair ) used multiple images to rather chic effect; currently at the National Theatre, Alan Ayckbourn's House and Garden simultaneously cover two aspects of the same event in adjoining theatres with the same actors. </p> <p>Now, Mike Figgis has had the idea of dividing the screen into four segments and following a group of characters over 90 minutes of unbroken time, using a digital video camera so that there are no cuts, thus going far beyond the elaborate 10-minute takes of Hitchcock and Mikl\u00f3s Jancs\u00f3. The experience is not unlike that of a security guard constantly having to keep an eye on a bank of screens to spot intruders or shoplifters, except that in this case everyone in sight has a familiar movie face and they're all carefully miked. </p> <p>The time is an autumn afternoon in Hollywood. As the movie begins, in the top left-hand corner, a rich lesbian (Jeanne Tripplehorn) with a stretch limo, is taking her flighty Hispanic lover (Salma Hayek) to an audition. In the top-right frame, a distressed woman (Saffron Burrows) is talking of a failing marriage to her shrink (Glenne Headley). The bottom-left image takes in the lobby of the independent film company, Red Mullet Productions (the title of Figgis's firm), where a notice announces that auditions are being held for Bitch From Louisiana . The bottom-right screen shows an office where the studio's young executives wait the arrival of their inspirational chief, Alex (Stellan Skarsgard). </p> <p>Over the next 90 minutes, as the characters criss-cross and collide, moving from one frame to another, we come to understand the relationships (for example, the woman in therapy is the producer's wife, who, in turn, is the lover of the Hispanic actress) and to recognise them as Tinseltown types - the coke-sniffing director, the alcoholic executive at the end of his tether, the disgusted wife, the suave agent. </p> <p>That they carry conviction stems from the fact that the performers, who are ad-libbing, know these people and their jargon, though towards the end there are some awkward moments. </p> <p>The action is punctuated by four jarring earth tremors (surely a record for one afternoon in LA) and like most Hollywood tales (Fitzgerald intended to conclude The Last Tycoon with Monroe Stahr's murder), the film leads towards a violent death. </p> <p> Time Code is a virtuoso exercise of timing, lighting and planning; one marvels at the sang-froid of Figgis, his cast and crew. Though he constantly directs us to the dominant image of the moment by lowering the sound in the other panels, we're always watching what's going on elsewhere from the corner of our eye. </p> <p>In the long take that opens Altman's The Player , several characters discuss the nature of the long takes in Welles and Hitchcock. In Time Code , a pretentious woman director, quoting Leibnitz, Borges, Eisenstein, and the Bauhaus theorists, makes a pitch to executives of Red Mullet about a film that uses multiple screens and continuous takes to tell a story in which 'the audience will provide the synthesis'. She's describing the film we're watching and though Alex the producer calls it 'the most pretentious shit I ever heard', they agree to green-light her movie. </p> <p>Will Time Code lead some where or is it a one-off? The Danish films from the soon-defunct Dogme group made us reconsider the technique of current mainstream cinema and it may well be that this California syrup of Figgis may prove a useful intellectual purgative. </p> <p>It makes us think about the way our perception of the world has been affected by film. But entertaining as it is, Time Code is physically taxing and one recalls those doctors in the early part of the last century who cautioned that the flickering screen could make you blind. </p> <p>I admire this film, but emerged from it feeling exhausted, the way you do from a cocktail party where the chatter has been deafening and you've been anxiously glancing around, wondering whether conversation in other parts of the room was more interesting.</p>",

The experience is not unlike that of a security guard constantly having to keep an eye on a bank of screens to spot intruders or shoplifters, except that in this case everyone in sight has a familiar movie face and they're all carefully miked. The time is an autumn afternoon in Hollywood. As the movie begins, in the top left-hand corner, a rich lesbian (Jeanne Tripplehorn) with a stretch limo, is taking her flighty Hispanic lover (Salma Hayek) to an audition. In the top-right frame, a distressed woman (Saffron Burrows) is talking of a failing marriage to her shrink (Glenne Headley). The bottom-left image takes in the lobby of the independent film company, Red Mullet Productions (the title of Figgis's firm), where a notice announces that auditions are being held for Bitch From Louisiana . The bottom-right screen shows an office where the studio's young executives wait the arrival of their inspirational chief, Alex (Stellan Skarsgard). Over the next 90 minutes, as the characters criss-cross and collide, moving from one frame to another, we come to understand the relationships (for example, the woman in therapy is the producer's wife, who, in turn, is the lover of the Hispanic actress) and to recognise them as Tinseltown types - the coke-sniffing director, the alcoholic executive at the end of his tether, the disgusted wife, the suave agent. That they carry conviction stems from the fact that the performers, who are ad-libbing, know these people and their jargon, though towards the end there are some awkward moments. The action is punctuated by four jarring earth tremors (surely a record for one afternoon in LA) and like most Hollywood tales (Fitzgerald intended to conclude The Last Tycoon with Monroe Stahr's murder), the film leads towards a violent death. Time Code is a virtuoso exercise of timing, lighting and planning; one marvels at the sang-froid of Figgis, his cast and crew. Though he constantly directs us to the dominant image of the moment by lowering the sound in the other panels, we're always watching what's going on elsewhere from the corner of our eye. In the long take that opens Altman's The Player , several characters discuss the nature of the long takes in Welles and Hitchcock. In Time Code , a pretentious woman director, quoting Leibnitz, Borges, Eisenstein, and the Bauhaus theorists, makes a pitch to executives of Red Mullet about a film that uses multiple screens and continuous takes to tell a story in which 'the audience will provide the synthesis'. She's describing the film we're watching and though Alex the producer calls it 'the most pretentious shit I ever heard', they agree to green-light her movie. Will Time Code lead some where or is it a one-off? The Danish films from the soon-defunct Dogme group made us reconsider the technique of current mainstream cinema and it may well be that this California syrup of Figgis may prove a useful intellectual purgative. It makes us think about the way our perception of the world has been affected by film. But entertaining as it is, Time Code is physically taxing and one recalls those doctors in the early part of the last century who cautioned that the flickering screen could make you blind. I admire this film, but emerged from it feeling exhausted, the way you do from a cocktail party where the chatter has been deafening and you've been anxiously glancing around, wondering whether conversation in other parts of the room was more interesting.",

If that doesn't square with your image of Paul Klee as the creator of playful, scratchy, postcard-sized comedies, then it's hardly surprising - there hasn't been a show of his work in Britain for decades. </p> <p>With a few exceptions in permanent collections, postcards are practically all we've had of his prodigious output until now. For that reason alone <strong> The Private Klee</strong> is a revelation, particularly since most of the paintings have never been seen in public before. But more than that, the show manages to condense his whole career in 140 tiny pictures. This is the miniaturist in miniature, the pocket A-Z. </p> <p>If you see him as a comic master, the court jester of early modernism, then you won't be disappointed by this wonderful selection. Dogs perform antic send-ups of human dramas, room-service is provided by angels bearing tea trays, fish migrate upriver, winking conspiratorially as they shimmy off to breed. </p> <p>From 1905, when Klee was in his twenties, there is a gruff-looking Icarus, one limb in a splint, and a decrepit phoenix not so much rising as stuck in the mud. From 1918, there is a church bell tolling, the chimes drawn as a juddering Heath-Robinson contraption exploding directly into the ear of a startled passer-by. Klee had already invented the ingenious pictographic style that would run and run from Hoffnung, Thurber and Ronald Searle to the illustrators and cartoonists of the present day. </p> <p>This humour is not incidental to some high-art enterprise - it is the essential character of everything he made. Klee didn't even call himself an artist until 1914, when he took a trip to Tunisia and declared he'd finally discovered colour at the age of 35. </p> <p>Look at The Harbour of Hammamet , painted in 1914, and you see some truth in this claim. There are the tessellations of floating colour - decoupled from line - the toy boats, the little palm trees, the trademark triangles. It could be an overture of things to come, right down to the backside of a quizzical beast legging it from the picture. </p> <p>From this point until his early death in 1940, Klee was absorbed in a continuous, unpredictable, exhilarating experiment. 'No day without a line' was his motto and no day without some quirky new method. Edinburgh has a case of his improvised tools: dinner knives, manicure sticks, a few hairs bound to a bamboo tube. </p> <p>He painted on glass, canvas, plaster and newsprint, on handkerchiefs, wrapping paper and parachute silk. He would turn an accidental blot into a sudden new planet or exoticise a panel of invented hieroglyphics with a frame of tin foil. </p> <p>One of the most brilliant works here, Scholar (1933), is a mixture of watercolour and wax applied to sackcloth. Three lines - an oval, a tight lip and a frown drawn pompously low over one eye - and you have the parody Casaubon incised in a brown study of fusty old fabric. </p> <p>'Taking a line for a walk' was Klee's imperishable phrase, though it doesn't begin to describe his gift for selecting, balancing and orchestrating lines so that they take the eye for a walk through fields of graphic energy. You need time for this show because there is so much to read, from the swarms of coded symbols - arrows, clefs, pyramids, flags - along the high wires, up and down the ladders and via the crosshatchings and musical staves that act as a kind of underlying grammar. This is even before the words Klee inscribed in his pictures, the titles, jokes and comic exclamations, the tiny signatures alighting on the canvas like interested insects. </p> <p>It is often said that Klee created music for the eye or that he took the language of art and translated it into a new idiom scaled to the world of a child. That may be so, but it seems to take too simple a cue from all those quavers and punctuation marks. It also accepts at face value Klee's own theories about art, elaborated during his stint as the Buddha of the Bauhaus in the 1920s. </p> <p>For such a modest man - look at his oblique, effacing self-portraits - Klee's manifestos were incredibly ambitious. He believed that musical counterpoint could be transcribed into colour, that a visual equivalent to every spiritual emotion could be found. Fortunately, you can walk right through this show unaware of Klee's theories, which is the emotional equivalent of escaping homework. But his deepest statement has been included - 'Art does not render the visible, it renders visible.' </p> <p>Klee was speaking mystically, but what's rendered visible in his work is surely the artist's own spirit - lightsome, benign, supremely comical. </p> <p>Klee has a whole range of humorous smiles. The sympathetic: a man obsessed, tiny hands clasped to breast, his outsize head filled to bursting with the shapely image of the beloved. The zany: a menagerie of wild animals on a day-trip to the country. The affectionate: badly over-excited children collapsing in a scribble on the floor. </p> <p>Above all, Klee's wit disarms. His snakes - he apparently liked chatting to snakes while out walking - are skittish wriggles, not even Jungle Book scary. Anxiety, for him, is a little guy toying absurdly with the edge of a cliff; war is a bunch of cockeyed devils. </p> <p>Klee did paint more ambivalent and melancholy works, particularly after escaping from the Nazis in 1933, but the Burgi family, who helped him reach Switzerland, have more light than shade in their private collection. </p> <p>Even on this scale, it's possible to see the colossal influence Klee has had over art - from Picasso to op and pop - and the way he opened up the whole act of making. You can't get this from reproductions, any more than the humour that seems to be ingrained in the very fabric of his paintings. </p> <p>Edinburgh is the only chance to see the Burgi collection in Britain. Don't miss these smiling, smile-inducing paintings.</p>",

You need time for this show because there is so much to read, from the swarms of coded symbols - arrows, clefs, pyramids, flags - along the high wires, up and down the ladders and via the crosshatchings and musical staves that act as a kind of underlying grammar. This is even before the words Klee inscribed in his pictures, the titles, jokes and comic exclamations, the tiny signatures alighting on the canvas like interested insects. It is often said that Klee created music for the eye or that he took the language of art and translated it into a new idiom scaled to the world of a child. That may be so, but it seems to take too simple a cue from all those quavers and punctuation marks. It also accepts at face value Klee's own theories about art, elaborated during his stint as the Buddha of the Bauhaus in the 1920s. For such a modest man - look at his oblique, effacing self-portraits - Klee's manifestos were incredibly ambitious. He believed that musical counterpoint could be transcribed into colour, that a visual equivalent to every spiritual emotion could be found. Fortunately, you can walk right through this show unaware of Klee's theories, which is the emotional equivalent of escaping homework. But his deepest statement has been included - 'Art does not render the visible, it renders visible.' Klee was speaking mystically, but what's rendered visible in his work is surely the artist's own spirit - lightsome, benign, supremely comical. Klee has a whole range of humorous smiles. The sympathetic: a man obsessed, tiny hands clasped to breast, his outsize head filled to bursting with the shapely image of the beloved. The zany: a menagerie of wild animals on a day-trip to the country. The affectionate: badly over-excited children collapsing in a scribble on the floor. Above all, Klee's wit disarms. His snakes - he apparently liked chatting to snakes while out walking - are skittish wriggles, not even Jungle Book scary. Anxiety, for him, is a little guy toying absurdly with the edge of a cliff; war is a bunch of cockeyed devils. Klee did paint more ambivalent and melancholy works, particularly after escaping from the Nazis in 1933, but the Burgi family, who helped him reach Switzerland, have more light than shade in their private collection. Even on this scale, it's possible to see the colossal influence Klee has had over art - from Picasso to op and pop - and the way he opened up the whole act of making. You can't get this from reproductions, any more than the humour that seems to be ingrained in the very fabric of his paintings. Edinburgh is the only chance to see the Burgi collection in Britain. Don't miss these smiling, smile-inducing paintings.",

      "body": "<p><strong> No 2 </strong> Assembly Rooms <br><strong> Barbaric Comedies</strong> Kings Theatre <br><strong> Don Juan</strong> Royal Lyceum Theatre <br><strong> Picasso's Women</strong> Assembly Rooms </p> <p>The festival is in disarray. Stretched between official and Fringe events, it lasts too long and it's too bad. And its points of reference are topsy-turvy. Where do you expect the crispest writing and accomplished direction? The Traverse. So in what sense is the Traverse part of the Fringe? Why should the official festival, with its big-name directors, its makeover merchants, be called 'international' when it's more often a modestly funded Fringe performance that wires you directly into another culture's psyche? </p> <p>As does Toa Fraser's gentle Fiji romance,<strong> No 2</strong> . This South Seas bubble draws on the background of its 25-year-old dramatist and its 20-year-old actor: Fraser's family left Fiji for New Zealand in the Fifties; the magically self-transforming Madeleine Sami is part Fijian Indian. A gradually unwinding story of family quarrels and closeness is told through dreams and legends, sharp gossip and hip-hop. </p> <p>In an Auckland house, the number two of the title, a crotchety old Fijian matriarch, drinker of homemade grog, puffer of cigars, lover of fighting and music, of Jill Dando and Jamie Oliver, dreams of long-lost ancestral customs - and of deciding which of her grandchildren will succeed her as head of the clan. </p> <p>Sami plays all the contenders. She's the crosspatch, sentimental old woman, with clipped vowels and crooked arms. She's the precocious infant with a big chin and a comprehensive knowledge of island legend. She's a lovesick rugby player - her voice shifting into a husky male register - and his randy, athletically break-dancing cousin. She's a self-obsessed model called Hibiscus, and an eerie English girl. She's a marvel who could only happen on the Fringe. </p> <p>The International Festival got off to a dreadful start with the Abbey Theatre Dublin's production of <strong> Barbaric Comedies</strong> . The Galician dramatist Ram\u00f3n Maria del Valle-Incl\u00e1n has been credited as an influence on Almod\u00f3var, Lorca and Bu\u00f1uel; he has been lauded for employing a ground-breaking, anti-naturalistic cinematic technique, and celebrated as a self-destructive dandy. All this may be true, but on the evidence of Frank McGuinness's new version of the dramatist's trilogy, it's hard to see why anyone would love his plays for themselves. </p> <p>Under Calixto Bieito's direction, Barbaric Comedies is a mess. On to a murkily lit stage surge grateful peasants, corrupt cardinals, unsullied damsels, wild-eyed whores and bloodthirsty brothers. Everyone seems to have come out of the stock cupboard of Spanish drama. A randy old goat of a father provides one of the mainstays of the plot, with his unconvincing progress from lech to penitent. Its most lucid moments are its most lurid: varied violent rapes, and masturbation over the boiled-up corpse of a woman. Hardly a minute of the four and a half hours seems to pass without someone yelling, wailing, falling to the ground or waving their legs in the air. </p> <p>Mats Ek's production of Moli\u00e8re's <strong> Don Juan</strong> - brought from the Royal Dramatic Theatre, Stockholm, and performed in Swedish - is more composed. So composed that, with all its wheezes, it gives off an air of being constructed, made up. Which is not entirely appropriate as a way of treating a hero who gets carried away. A director is strutting his stuff. </p> <p>Ek's major innovation - apart from turning every sexual innuendo into a sexual act - is to introduce dance sequences throughout the play. Squirmy-legged or smooching, these intervals are often amusing, but it's not clear what prompts them. Are they underlining or undermining what is being said? Why does such movement not seep into the rest of the play? </p> <p>There's more flash than illumination. But there are moments of great flair. About to be given the nod by the statue of the Commendatore, Don Juan and his valet advance towards the audience, only to find themselves cut off - and forever - from the world they've inhabited as the safety curtain comes down behind them. Just before going to hell, the dirty Don slumps in a scarlet chair, with the orange glow from a television flickering over his face like infernal flames. And Mikael Persbrandt is compelling in the title role: a fleshy, dead-eyed voluptuary who puts on a really bad black wig to go wooing. </p> <p>This year is proving to be something of a philanderfest. At the Assembly Rooms, four one-person plays are devoted to the cross reflections of women who have been soured by living with a 'penis who paints'. </p> <p><strong> Picasso's Women</strong> sets out to tell the stories of some of the artist's companions, to give them back the voices they always thought they had. But despite the considerable and sometimes glittering efforts of the four actresses, Brian McAvera's plays succeed only in presenting a series of dull stereotypes. </p> <p>There's Dora Maar, played unweepingly and too reverentially by Toyah Wilcox: the mad (but not really) one.

      "bodyText": "No 2 Assembly Rooms Barbaric Comedies Kings Theatre Don Juan Royal Lyceum Theatre Picasso's Women Assembly Rooms The festival is in disarray. Stretched between official and Fringe events, it lasts too long and it's too bad. And its points of reference are topsy-turvy. Where do you expect the crispest writing and accomplished direction? The Traverse. So in what sense is the Traverse part of the Fringe? Why should the official festival, with its big-name directors, its makeover merchants, be called 'international' when it's more often a modestly funded Fringe performance that wires you directly into another culture's psyche? As does Toa Fraser's gentle Fiji romance, No 2 . This South Seas bubble draws on the background of its 25-year-old dramatist and its 20-year-old actor: Fraser's family left Fiji for New Zealand in the Fifties; the magically self-transforming Madeleine Sami is part Fijian Indian. A gradually unwinding story of family quarrels and closeness is told through dreams and legends, sharp gossip and hip-hop. In an Auckland house, the number two of the title, a crotchety old Fijian matriarch, drinker of homemade grog, puffer of cigars, lover of fighting and music, of Jill Dando and Jamie Oliver, dreams of long-lost ancestral customs - and of deciding which of her grandchildren will succeed her as head of the clan. Sami plays all the contenders. She's the crosspatch, sentimental old woman, with clipped vowels and crooked arms. She's the precocious infant with a big chin and a comprehensive knowledge of island legend. She's a lovesick rugby player - her voice shifting into a husky male register - and his randy, athletically break-dancing cousin. She's a self-obsessed model called Hibiscus, and an eerie English girl. She's a marvel who could only happen on the Fringe. The International Festival got off to a dreadful start with the Abbey Theatre Dublin's production of Barbaric Comedies . The Galician dramatist Ram\u00f3n Maria del Valle-Incl\u00e1n has been credited as an influence on Almod\u00f3var, Lorca and Bu\u00f1uel; he has been lauded for employing a ground-breaking, anti-naturalistic cinematic technique, and celebrated as a self-destructive dandy. All this may be true, but on the evidence of Frank McGuinness's new version of the dramatist's trilogy, it's hard to see why anyone would love his plays for themselves. Under Calixto Bieito's direction, Barbaric Comedies is a mess. On to a murkily lit stage surge grateful peasants, corrupt cardinals, unsullied damsels, wild-eyed whores and bloodthirsty brothers. Everyone seems to have come out of the stock cupboard of Spanish drama. A randy old goat of a father provides one of the mainstays of the plot, with his unconvincing progress from lech to penitent. Its most lucid moments are its most lurid: varied violent rapes, and masturbation over the boiled-up corpse of a woman. Hardly a minute of the four and a half hours seems to pass without someone yelling, wailing, falling to the ground or waving their legs in the air. Mats Ek's production of Moli\u00e8re's Don Juan - brought from the Royal Dramatic Theatre, Stockholm, and performed in Swedish - is more composed. So composed that, with all its wheezes, it gives off an air of being constructed, made up. Which is not entirely appropriate as a way of treating a hero who gets carried away. A director is strutting his stuff. Ek's major innovation - apart from turning every sexual innuendo into a sexual act - is to introduce dance sequences throughout the play. Squirmy-legged or smooching, these intervals are often amusing, but it's not clear what prompts them. Are they underlining or undermining what is being said? Why does such movement not seep into the rest of the play? There's more flash than illumination. But there are moments of great flair. About to be given the nod by the statue of the Commendatore, Don Juan and his valet advance towards the audience, only to find themselves cut off - and forever - from the world they've inhabited as the safety curtain comes down behind them. Just before going to hell, the dirty Don slumps in a scarlet chair, with the orange glow from a television flickering over his face like infernal flames. And Mikael Persbrandt is compelling in the title role: a fleshy, dead-eyed voluptuary who puts on a really bad black wig to go wooing. This year is proving to be something of a philanderfest. At the Assembly Rooms, four one-person plays are devoted to the cross reflections of women who have been soured by living with a 'penis who paints'. Picasso's Women sets out to tell the stories of some of the artist's companions, to give them back the voices they always thought they had. But despite the considerable and sometimes glittering efforts of the four actresses, Brian McAvera's plays succeed only in presenting a series of dull stereotypes. There's Dora Maar, played unweepingly and too reverentially by Toyah Wilcox: the mad (but not really) one. There's Olga, the Russian aristocrat of the 'darlink' variety who obliges Geraldine Fitzgerald to produce a quantity of soulful, gurgling vowels. More fruitfully, Amanda Harris - as Fran\u00e7oise Gilot, the fierce one who got away - steamrollers over the banalities of her script with her great swooping voice and powerful, pent-up movements, and suggests someone who might have sculpted her own life and works. And Susannah York is so fluid and beguiling that she takes the sting out of the boringly reductive view of Jacqueline Roque as the minx who plotted to get the genius. Still, it's a good idea and talent wasted. The women are diminished by the language they use. Their excitement at their lover is sometimes banal - Pablo provides 'the aphrodisiac of power' - and sometimes craven: 'after Picasso - God'. Their sexual descriptions are Mills &amp; Boon: female mounds and tent-peg nipples. And never is there a glimmer of what might be the other point: how each woman entered the paintings.",

      "byline": "Vanessa Thorpe",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Mark Brandon Read is clearly a suitable case for treatment. After all, he earned his affectionate nickname, the Chopper, by using a bolt-cutter to separate his victims' feet from their toes. He also won himself a place in the gossip columns when he shaved his own ears off in a Melbourne jail. Grounds for some psychiatric interest there certainly, but is Read also a suitable case for film treatment? </p> <p>The programmers at this year's Edinburgh Film Festival are in no doubt. Chopper , the blackly comic film version of the books that Read wrote while he was serving time in Australia, may not be listed in the official programme, but organisers see its last-minute accquisition as a 'coup'. The director of the festival, Lizzie Francke, secured screening rights after lengthy negotiations and points out that this homely story of 'a normal bloke who likes a bit of torture' has pushed Mel Gibson's The Patriot off the top box-office spot in Australian cinemas. </p> <p>The film has taken the fashionably flip approach to brutality into fresh territory. It marks another staging post in the quest to be artistically modern by shocking the public, if not with violence itself, then with a glibly amoral perspective. Murdoch's Fox Corporation abruptly pulled out of a distribution deal for Chopper over there, but back here, Metrodrome, the British independent, has boldly stepped in. Despite accusations that the film wilfully glamorises a man who admits 'wiping out' 19 people 'for the good of society', Metrodome's managing director, Rupert Preston, is happy to be bringing Chopper to a wider public. </p> <p>'Whatever people say about the violence, it is actually a good film,' he says. 'There is a gruesome scene where he is stabbed and we do see him cut his ears off so that he can get into prison hospital, but actually there is more vivid violence in any of the Scream sequels.' </p> <p>Preston believes what has shocked some people is the screenplay's obvious empathy with Read, who is played by the stand-up comedian Eric Bana. 'That is rather disturbing,' he admits. </p> <p>Across the city, Edinburgh's theatre audiences are shying away from the equally shocking excesses of the Barbaric Comedies . This play, which features necrophiliac masturbation, among other arcane depravities, has just as much to offer when it comes to shock value, but, according to critics less in the way of artistic merit. </p> <p>It is the Irish playwright Frank McGuinness's four-hour reworking of a Spanish trilogy which was written early last century by Ram\u00f3n del Valle-Incl\u00e1n. 'The world portrayed by Valle-Incl\u00e1n is a very brutal one,' says Ben Barnes, the artistic director of Dublin's Abbey Theatre, the company behind the production. 'But none of the violence is there without a purpose.' </p> <p>Rather like Mark Brandon Read, Valle-Incl\u00e1n was more famous for his eccentric lifestyle than for his writings. He insisted on having his left arm amputated when it was injured in a fight. His 16-hour stage epic was not thought fit to stage in his lifetime, so why are we expected to embrace it now? </p> <p>It is a sympton of a new brutalism in entertainment which is sweeping across both traditionally highbrow and lowbrow cultural platforms. The Royal Court Theatre's recent production of On Rafferty's Hill upset audiences with its opening rape scene and Patrick McGrath's new novel, Martha Peake , contains an equally unsettling incestuous rape scene at its core. Looked at in tandem with the headline-grabbing tactics of the Young British Artists, such as the biologically-fixated Jake and Dinos Chapman, it seems that art has to be unpleasantly disturbing. </p> <p>Jonathan Bartley, the general secretary of the Movement for Christian Democracy, claims he is far from a foam-mouthed censor, but he believes that the search for artistic impact has now gone too far. </p> <p>'The work we have been doing on media and screen dependency has suggested that people have been desensitised,' he says. 'In order to get a better reaction artists have had to go to further extremes. It is about finding a new kick and a new thrill. Very often, these shock tactics are a substitute for real creativity.' So is there no other purpose behind this ceaseless search for more raw and brutal forms of diversion? </p> <p>The playwright Howard Brenton views the question with more perspective than most. Twenty years ago, his play Romans in Britain rocked the middle classes with its scenes of nudity and male rape. The critic James Fenton called it a 'nauseating load of rubbish' and moral guardian Mary Whitehouse launched a private prosecution against the director, Michael Bogdanov. 'Shock tactics are as old as the theatre,' he says, 'but they are not enough on their own.' </p> <p>Brenton believes the only memorable dramatic shocks are those that reveal something relevant, whether it is the moment in Euripides's Bacchae when Agave enters carrying the head of her son, or the moment in Coward's The Vortex when a heroin syringe is produced. 'Shakespeare understood the proper build-up of horror in Titus Andronicus , but people do it now because you can write it quickly and it is a solution to a creative problem.' </p> <p>The modern race for value-added shocks may then be heading for an artistic brick wall. For a start, many of those supposedly 'upset' audience members who walked out of performances of the Barbaric Comedies in Edinburgh are as likely to have been bored as they were offended. </p> <p>If creative brutality has really entered a phase of destructive decadence, there is at least one man who will be celebrating. J.G. Ballard, who wrote the book Crash that was then turned into a controversial film, suspects the trend is a good thing. </p> <p>'In the years leading up to the abolition of censorship in the late Sixties, filmmakers and writers and artists were all pushing against those barriers,' he argues. 'But since then we have been fighting back against something different - against the all-pervasive entertainment culture and the sentimentalised values of TV blandness. People are searching for truth through trying to shock, although it may sometimes be an artificial truth that they find.' </p> <p>Ballard points to the public reaction to Tracey Emin's unmade bed or to David Cronenberg's film version of Crash . 'Mainstream entertainment is so manufactured now and this is what extreme artists are kicking against. </p> <p>'As a result, many younger writers and filmmakers are now simply expressing their own obsessions; that is all that is left that they feel they can say something truthful about. They don't want to accept the values imposed on them by adverts and entertainment corporations - and on the whole that is a good thing.' </p> <p>Ballard concedes, however, that it is all too easy to exploit shock tactics.

      "bodyText": "Mark Brandon Read is clearly a suitable case for treatment. After all, he earned his affectionate nickname, the Chopper, by using a bolt-cutter to separate his victims' feet from their toes. He also won himself a place in the gossip columns when he shaved his own ears off in a Melbourne jail. Grounds for some psychiatric interest there certainly, but is Read also a suitable case for film treatment? The programmers at this year's Edinburgh Film Festival are in no doubt. Chopper , the blackly comic film version of the books that Read wrote while he was serving time in Australia, may not be listed in the official programme, but organisers see its last-minute accquisition as a 'coup'. The director of the festival, Lizzie Francke, secured screening rights after lengthy negotiations and points out that this homely story of 'a normal bloke who likes a bit of torture' has pushed Mel Gibson's The Patriot off the top box-office spot in Australian cinemas. The film has taken the fashionably flip approach to brutality into fresh territory. It marks another staging post in the quest to be artistically modern by shocking the public, if not with violence itself, then with a glibly amoral perspective. Murdoch's Fox Corporation abruptly pulled out of a distribution deal for Chopper over there, but back here, Metrodrome, the British independent, has boldly stepped in. Despite accusations that the film wilfully glamorises a man who admits 'wiping out' 19 people 'for the good of society', Metrodome's managing director, Rupert Preston, is happy to be bringing Chopper to a wider public. 'Whatever people say about the violence, it is actually a good film,' he says. 'There is a gruesome scene where he is stabbed and we do see him cut his ears off so that he can get into prison hospital, but actually there is more vivid violence in any of the Scream sequels.' Preston believes what has shocked some people is the screenplay's obvious empathy with Read, who is played by the stand-up comedian Eric Bana. 'That is rather disturbing,' he admits. Across the city, Edinburgh's theatre audiences are shying away from the equally shocking excesses of the Barbaric Comedies . This play, which features necrophiliac masturbation, among other arcane depravities, has just as much to offer when it comes to shock value, but, according to critics less in the way of artistic merit. It is the Irish playwright Frank McGuinness's four-hour reworking of a Spanish trilogy which was written early last century by Ram\u00f3n del Valle-Incl\u00e1n. 'The world portrayed by Valle-Incl\u00e1n is a very brutal one,' says Ben Barnes, the artistic director of Dublin's Abbey Theatre, the company behind the production. 'But none of the violence is there without a purpose.' Rather like Mark Brandon Read, Valle-Incl\u00e1n was more famous for his eccentric lifestyle than for his writings. He insisted on having his left arm amputated when it was injured in a fight. His 16-hour stage epic was not thought fit to stage in his lifetime, so why are we expected to embrace it now? It is a sympton of a new brutalism in entertainment which is sweeping across both traditionally highbrow and lowbrow cultural platforms. The Royal Court Theatre's recent production of On Rafferty's Hill upset audiences with its opening rape scene and Patrick McGrath's new novel, Martha Peake , contains an equally unsettling incestuous rape scene at its core. Looked at in tandem with the headline-grabbing tactics of the Young British Artists, such as the biologically-fixated Jake and Dinos Chapman, it seems that art has to be unpleasantly disturbing. Jonathan Bartley, the general secretary of the Movement for Christian Democracy, claims he is far from a foam-mouthed censor, but he believes that the search for artistic impact has now gone too far. 'The work we have been doing on media and screen dependency has suggested that people have been desensitised,' he says. 'In order to get a better reaction artists have had to go to further extremes. It is about finding a new kick and a new thrill. Very often, these shock tactics are a substitute for real creativity.' So is there no other purpose behind this ceaseless search for more raw and brutal forms of diversion? The playwright Howard Brenton views the question with more perspective than most. Twenty years ago, his play Romans in Britain rocked the middle classes with its scenes of nudity and male rape. The critic James Fenton called it a 'nauseating load of rubbish' and moral guardian Mary Whitehouse launched a private prosecution against the director, Michael Bogdanov. 'Shock tactics are as old as the theatre,' he says, 'but they are not enough on their own.' Brenton believes the only memorable dramatic shocks are those that reveal something relevant, whether it is the moment in Euripides's Bacchae when Agave enters carrying the head of her son, or the moment in Coward's The Vortex when a heroin syringe is produced. 'Shakespeare understood the proper build-up of horror in Titus Andronicus , but people do it now because you can write it quickly and it is a solution to a creative problem.' The modern race for value-added shocks may then be heading for an artistic brick wall. For a start, many of those supposedly 'upset' audience members who walked out of performances of the Barbaric Comedies in Edinburgh are as likely to have been bored as they were offended. If creative brutality has really entered a phase of destructive decadence, there is at least one man who will be celebrating. J.G. Ballard, who wrote the book Crash that was then turned into a controversial film, suspects the trend is a good thing. 'In the years leading up to the abolition of censorship in the late Sixties, filmmakers and writers and artists were all pushing against those barriers,' he argues. 'But since then we have been fighting back against something different - against the all-pervasive entertainment culture and the sentimentalised values of TV blandness. People are searching for truth through trying to shock, although it may sometimes be an artificial truth that they find.' Ballard points to the public reaction to Tracey Emin's unmade bed or to David Cronenberg's film version of Crash . 'Mainstream entertainment is so manufactured now and this is what extreme artists are kicking against. 'As a result, many younger writers and filmmakers are now simply expressing their own obsessions; that is all that is left that they feel they can say something truthful about. They don't want to accept the values imposed on them by adverts and entertainment corporations - and on the whole that is a good thing.' Ballard concedes, however, that it is all too easy to exploit shock tactics. 'After all, any drunk on an aeroplane can lean over and vomit on you and there is nothing original in that.' For Susie Orbach, the way that society handles its essential brutality is a key to understanding its pressures. 'We have lived in barbaric societies for many centuries now, but what is different is the particular forms that culture finds to express this,' she says. 'Shocking art does extend the repertoire, but I really don't think these images of depravity and mutilation are sitting inside everyone's psyche just waiting to come out. 'I do think a more general rage and emptiness can produce very violent feelings in society. The forms in which these are then being expressed creatively speak, instead, of a kind of desperation rather than about the brutality they seek to portray.' The new brutality is a symptom, then, of a general malaise. Something that may serve as a cry for attention but does not stand for the violence it enacts. 'These films and plays and artworks give an image to something that there is disquiet about,' says Orbach. 'They are not overtly political, but I think that what globalisation does is depoliticise people because no one has a relationship with civic society.' Orbach, like Ballard, believes brutal art forms represent part of a search to express something; it is just that, unfortunately, not every search produces something artistically interesting on its own terms. In attempting to encourage artists away from sex and violence, campaigners like Bartley and his Movement for Christian Democracy accidentally show how culturally defining the creative search for taboos always is. 'Playwrights and artists have always pushed back barriers, but those barriers have changed so that, for example, at certain times even paedophilia and rape were not quite so taboo and so were left alone. These things change.' The brutality that elicits a gasp or a boo from an audience will always highlight exactly where the edges of social acceptability lie, and, as a result, artists are never likely to be able to leave that edge alone.",

      "body": "<p> Simon Russell Beale has been deliberating the question of being or not being Hamlet for more than a decade. Ever since his landmark performance as Konstantin in Terry Hands's production of The Seagull in 1991, in which he graduated from being the RSC's favourite caricaturist to becoming the most perceptive English stage actor of his generation, he has been widely championed to play what he calls the 'other great mother-son role'. </p> <p> Still, he says, sipping coffee in the morning sun outside the Festival Theatre in Malvern where 'the H play' is previewing: 'You have to keep asking yourself, \"Why do I want to do it?\", though you know that at least part of the reason is that you want to join the club...' </p> <p>Even the current production has had its share of procrastination. It was originally to be directed for the National by Sam Mendes last year: 'Sam had said to me, kindly , after I'd done Iago with him in 1998, \"Christ you're not getting any younger, let's do it now\".' But then American Beauty was released and Mendes found himself jigging, ambling and lisping in Los Angeles. John Caird eventually offered to direct and Beale, at 39, will finally step out at the Lyttleton in his inky cloak at the beginning of next month.</p> <p> Surrounded now by Malvern's morning marketgoers, several of whom enthusiastically interrupt us to congratulate the actor on the previous night's performance (one formidable townswoman places Beale resolutely in her 'top three', as if he were vying for a place in the Champions League), he wears a look of relaxed relief that it's all finally happening.</p> <p> None the less, the first night in London will have an extra poignancy for him. He talks of the play as being 'a very accurate charting of grief' and that emotion has not been hard for him to summon in recent months. Immediately before he went into rehearsal, Russell Beale lost his mother, after a six-month battle with cancer. He comes from a close military family - his father was surgeon-general, in charge of medical matters for the armed forces - and it was his mother who primarily encouraged his acting. His own sense of loss being so raw has, he suggests, helped to resolve for him the question of Hamlet's 'madness'. </p> <p> 'Grief is like being mugged,' he says. 'Things are going along fine and then suddenly it hits you. So you can have a period where you are genuinely pleased to see your old friends, or enjoy fooling about or whatever, and that can exist alongside genuine despair. In that sense, the soliloquies are the moments when he is mugged. I know very clearly now how grief is unpredictable, how you don't know how you are going to feel one minute to the next, and that is Hamlet's madness exactly.' </p> <p> He says that in preview he has found himself thinking of his mother a lot while on stage - 'you can't avoid mothers in this part anyway' - and especially, poignantly, how 'the reason that she was able to resist the illness for as long as she did was her desire to see me do this play'. In some ways, he says, it's his tribute to her and, certainly, he explains, when he kneels down at the beginning of the play or when he describes 'that undiscover'd country from whose bourn no traveller returns', she is always there in his mind.</p> <p> I wonder if the role has helped him to work through his grief but he says it is too early to tell. 'I went straight into it after she died, so I've had no option in a way. What I'm not looking forward to is the bit after the press night in that sense. I always feel a bit postnatal anyway after the opening and I suspect I will be very aware that she should have been here to see it.'</p> <p> He suggests that in the past he has scoffed at fellow actors - Ralph Fiennes, Alex Jennings - telling him that playing Hamlet would change his life; now he's not so sure. What he has found in himself for the role, he says, is a 'much gentler, more autumnal Hamlet than I would have imagined myself doing; I suppose because I'd just done Iago and Richard III they are quite high definition. Hamlet is less definable; you just let it flow really.'</p> <p> Certainly, anyone who saw Russell Beale's scabrous Thersites (a part for which he rubbed tomatoes into his face every night so his skin stung and stank) will find his Hamlet surprisingly generous. The previous night, even on the cramped nutshell of the Malvern's stage, about half the size of that at the Lyttleton, he had managed to make his performance redolent of infinite space.</p> <p> His great facility has always been to interrogate every syllable in the text and to invest exuberant life in the most abstract of lines. As Hamlet, he continually finds humour and delight where many have been content to portray a more soupy melancholy.</p> <p> Though this ability to extract new nuances from the language has never been doubted - Russell Beale, who took a first in English at Cambridge, approaches his parts, as he says, as a visceral kind of 'three-dimensional lit crit' - there have been some critics over the years who have suggested that he would not make a great, top three Hamlet because he does not look the part.</p> <p> As he is the first to admit, his short, stocky frame and 'ordinary' face preclude the possibility of a Ralph Fiennes pretty-boy-lost interpretation. And though he thinks it's nonsense, really, the sense of his 'too-too solid flesh' remains at the back of his mind. 'You can't ignore it, I'm afraid,' he says, smiling a little wearily. 'The local paper here carried the inevitable \"Tubby or not tubby, fat is the question\" headline, so you can't help but be a little bit aware of it. But, in fact, it is totally ludicrous, even for someone as famously self-loathing as me, which I hasten to add I no longer am.' </p> <p> He points out that there are only two references to Hamlet's appearance in the play and both are 'extremely ambiguous'. First, there is Ophelia's description of the prince as a 'glass of fashion, mould of form', ('and there's no reason,' Russell Beale says, patting his belly, 'that I couldn't be the mould of form to someone who loves me'); while the later observation during the fencing match that he is 'he's fat and scant of breath' suits his purposes perfectly. 'I've been wondering why that was written,' he says. 'Maybe Richard Burbage was playing it till he was a middle-aged man.'</p> <p> Ever since he admitted in an early interview that 'I hate my body. I hate my looks. I hate my voice', questions of Russell Beale's appearance have rather dogged his career. He laughs them off now ('I rather like it when they call me \"potato face\"'), but when we talk about what he will do after Hamlet , when he's turned 40, I wonder if he's not a little envious of more glamorous contemporaries - Fiennes, Branagh - who have made the transition to film. </p> <p> 'It'll be odd' he says, of next year. 'I'll have done all the whoppers in terms of Shakespeare. I wonder if I'll go off in a different direction, I don't know, something off the stage, something more academic.' Over the years, he has often wondered this, talked about teaching, described himself as a frustrated historian, a subject he dropped in order originally to follow in the family footsteps and become a doctor.</p> <p> Still, talking to him, you get the sense that what he would really like to do is to give film acting a proper try. He laughs when I suggest to him that his career has been a serious and classical progression, as if that was never really what he had in mind.</p> <p> 'People always wonder why I've never done film as if there were these scripts piling in at all times. I can assure you that there aren't. I've sometimes said I'd probably be better on stage than on film, but I don't even know that really. I imagine I was covering my back a little.' </p> <p>He says that he has been half-hoping that his old friend Sam Mendes will offer him a screen role: 'I actually read an article yesterday about Sam doing this film with Tom Hanks and I did look down to see what the subject matter was in case I could phone him up. But it's gangsters in Thirties Chicago.' He rolls his eyes and adopts an even camper version of his voice: 'So maybe there are a few more suitable people around than me. It would take me years to adopt a Chicago accent.' </p> <p>Certainly an injection of film money would not be unwelcome. He bought his flat in Pimlico, where he lives alone ('I've not given up hope') with the proceeds of his show-stealing portrayal of Widmerpool in the televised adaptation of Anthony Powell's A Dance to the Music of Time , but other than that, and though he's not complaining, he lives on the \u00a3600-a-week regulation performance fee he gets from the National. 'It's funny,' he says. 'People always assume you earn hundreds of thousands of pounds for doing this, but that's not really the case at all.' </p> <p> Still, the wonderful thing about Russell Beale is that, for the next few months at least, you know he will not be worrying too much about his bank balance or what his Hollywood agent is up to ('I only saw him once and I've never heard from him since'). Instead, he'll be fretting about quite what he should be doing while the play within a play is in progress or the exact nature of his relationship with Ophelia.</p> <p> 'The great thing about this part is that you think you have it all tied down and then suddenly you find yourself wondering if you really know what \"calumny\" means or you think, \"Shit, am I sure what a bodkin is?\"' These are the big questions; smaller ones can look after themselves. </p>",

      "byline": "Stephanie Merritt",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Picture this: a reception in Fresher's Week and a cluster of tanned first-year students are hovering in an oak-panelled room, clutching warm sherry and eyeing each other self-consciously. 'I just got back from Australia two days ago,' says one. 'I'm like totally jet-lagged, we were just drinking twenty-four seven.' 'Oh God, yah, I was just in Goa,' says another, anxious to compete, 'and we were just like off our faces the whole time.' 'When I was in Koh Pan Yang,' says a blond boy with public school vowels, 'mushrooms were so cheap, I don't think I was straight for like six months.' 'I was the same in Bolivia,' says another, nodding sagely. 'I think it's like a really valuable experience to go to the East - it's so important to get away from western consumerism,' says a girl festooned in designer labels. 'What about you?' </p> <p>'Oh, I spent the year teaching illiterate Gypsy children in the south of Spain,' I say, aiming for studied nonchalance. A puzzled silence descends. The tanned faces buckle into expressions of incomprehension - ' Why? ' they are not quite saying. 'But I was like completely loaded the whole time,' I add quickly, in case they think I'm a Christian or a member of Amnesty International. </p> <p>Voluntary work always used to be the justification for spending a year abroad before university - you could get sponsorship, you got all the benefits of travel and it allowed you to demonstrate to your prospective institution what a noble person you were. It was also useful for persuading a generation of middle-class parents doubtful as to the wisdom of a year off that you were doing something that could be quantified as 'worthwhile', so they'd let you out of their sight. But in recent years there seems to have been a subtle shift of emphasis. According to the latest report by the Gap Year Company, fewer than 5 per cent of students travelling abroad before university take part in voluntary work; travel has become a valid end in itself and universities and employers are no more likely to be impressed if you spent a year building a hospital in Angola than if you spent it face down in your own vomit in a Thai brothel.</p> <p> Even Prince William - who will probably do neither of the above - is being encouraged to broaden his horizons by spending a year sampling another culture. The mere business of getting yourself to the other side of the world, not losing your passport or return ticket, avoiding rapists, pickpockets and murderers, and managing to get yourself home again without unwittingly packing 10 kilos of heroin is evidence of initiative, curiosity and a survival instinct that will prepare you well for adult life. At least, this is what the students tell their parents. </p> <p>But even if all this unbridled hedonism has left the do-gooding teenager on the edge of extinction, I still firmly believe that a gap year should be compulsory for all right-thinking young people about to go off to university. There are pros and cons to every choice, of course, but the crucial advantage common to all gap year experiences is that it forces you to grow up. Some might argue that stumbling round the subcontinent in your underwear eating the local hallucinogens while trying to have sex with Australians is not necessarily proof of maturity, but at least it gives you the chance to live away from home for the first time and make all your mistakes before you get to college. A gap year is a chance to reinvent yourself. You're transient, as are the people you meet - they don't know your parents, they don't know whether you were a geek at school, they don't know that you used to do your hair like Robert Smith without irony. You can be an entirely different person, and since you'll never see any of these people again (even if you do, none of you will remember), you can practice inventing your new away-from-home personality so that you get it right before you make it to university and are stuck with it for the next three years. </p> <p>It's also very hard not to become more interesting after a year of travel. During those first terrifying days at university, no matter how often people tell you their totally cool and totally identical stories about trekking through Nepal on acid, they're still more fun to talk to than those - how young they seem! - who are still having the conversation about what A levels they got. That was, like, years ago ! (Or - God forbid - the ones who spent their year off working for an engineering firm in Swindon and who turn up at college with smug sponsorship cheques in their student account and rollerball pens in their breast pockets. This is not a valid use of your year off.) </p> <p>A gap year is for being bold, adventurous, wild - and, in some cases, altruistic. The great advantage of voluntary work, apart from the spiritual rewards and the warm glow inside that comes from helping others, is that people are more likely to give you money if they think you're teaching poor children how to read than if they think you're spending it on skunk and tequila. (Which is not to say that you can't do both.) It also gives you the chance to engage with the local people and become part of a community in a way that is impossible if you only pass through with a backpack. The key is to find an organisation that is not too rigid in its structures and rules, so that you can combine the hard work with the kind of self-exploration and experimentation that is the main point of a gap year. </p> <p>Unless you're exceptionally lucky - or rich - you'll leave university with at least \u00a35,000 of debt, get sucked into the relentless carousel of job interviews, acquire more debt, and carefree travelling will become an impossible luxury. My advice would be: go while you've got the chance - build schools, climb mountains, learn to dive, learn a language, smoke dope, drink too much and have a fantastic time. Find yourself. Just don't find yourself in an office... </p> <p><strong> Ten facts about gap years</strong><br> </p> <p> 150,000, or one in five, students take a gap year before entering university </p> <p><strong> 2</strong> 35,000 are state school leavers and 15,000 are from independent schools. 30% are women travelling alone. </p> <p><strong> 3</strong> Only 10,000 of the 200,000 people aged 26 and under who take gap years embark on a structured placement. </p> <p><strong> 4</strong> More than half of all school leavers taking gap years remain in Europe; one in 10 visits Central or South America. </p> <p><strong> 5</strong> Australia is the most popular destination among older travellers, with one-fifth spending most of their time there. </p> <p><strong> 6</strong> The least popular destination is Africa. </p> <p><strong> 7</strong> Asia is popular among all age groups. On average, 14% of British travellers visit the Far East. </p> <p><strong> 8</strong> Of those returning from trips, 70% say they would go again. Two-thirds claim that their gap-year experience has changed them. </p> <p><strong> 9</strong> One-third of people taking a gap year travel alone, and nearly half set off with just one companion; 20% of backpackers do not return with the person they left with. </p> <p><strong> 10</strong> \u00a32,000 is the average spent on a six-month trip. The biggest problem for those wishing to take a gap year is raising enough money; the second biggest problem is securing a visa. </p> <p> Research by Ben Cooper </p>",

      "bodyText": "Picture this: a reception in Fresher's Week and a cluster of tanned first-year students are hovering in an oak-panelled room, clutching warm sherry and eyeing each other self-consciously. 'I just got back from Australia two days ago,' says one. 'I'm like totally jet-lagged, we were just drinking twenty-four seven.' 'Oh God, yah, I was just in Goa,' says another, anxious to compete, 'and we were just like off our faces the whole time.' 'When I was in Koh Pan Yang,' says a blond boy with public school vowels, 'mushrooms were so cheap, I don't think I was straight for like six months.' 'I was the same in Bolivia,' says another, nodding sagely. 'I think it's like a really valuable experience to go to the East - it's so important to get away from western consumerism,' says a girl festooned in designer labels. 'What about you?' 'Oh, I spent the year teaching illiterate Gypsy children in the south of Spain,' I say, aiming for studied nonchalance. A puzzled silence descends. The tanned faces buckle into expressions of incomprehension - ' Why? ' they are not quite saying. 'But I was like completely loaded the whole time,' I add quickly, in case they think I'm a Christian or a member of Amnesty International. Voluntary work always used to be the justification for spending a year abroad before university - you could get sponsorship, you got all the benefits of travel and it allowed you to demonstrate to your prospective institution what a noble person you were. It was also useful for persuading a generation of middle-class parents doubtful as to the wisdom of a year off that you were doing something that could be quantified as 'worthwhile', so they'd let you out of their sight. But in recent years there seems to have been a subtle shift of emphasis. According to the latest report by the Gap Year Company, fewer than 5 per cent of students travelling abroad before university take part in voluntary work; travel has become a valid end in itself and universities and employers are no more likely to be impressed if you spent a year building a hospital in Angola than if you spent it face down in your own vomit in a Thai brothel. Even Prince William - who will probably do neither of the above - is being encouraged to broaden his horizons by spending a year sampling another culture. The mere business of getting yourself to the other side of the world, not losing your passport or return ticket, avoiding rapists, pickpockets and murderers, and managing to get yourself home again without unwittingly packing 10 kilos of heroin is evidence of initiative, curiosity and a survival instinct that will prepare you well for adult life. At least, this is what the students tell their parents. But even if all this unbridled hedonism has left the do-gooding teenager on the edge of extinction, I still firmly believe that a gap year should be compulsory for all right-thinking young people about to go off to university. There are pros and cons to every choice, of course, but the crucial advantage common to all gap year experiences is that it forces you to grow up. Some might argue that stumbling round the subcontinent in your underwear eating the local hallucinogens while trying to have sex with Australians is not necessarily proof of maturity, but at least it gives you the chance to live away from home for the first time and make all your mistakes before you get to college. A gap year is a chance to reinvent yourself. You're transient, as are the people you meet - they don't know your parents, they don't know whether you were a geek at school, they don't know that you used to do your hair like Robert Smith without irony. You can be an entirely different person, and since you'll never see any of these people again (even if you do, none of you will remember), you can practice inventing your new away-from-home personality so that you get it right before you make it to university and are stuck with it for the next three years. It's also very hard not to become more interesting after a year of travel. During those first terrifying days at university, no matter how often people tell you their totally cool and totally identical stories about trekking through Nepal on acid, they're still more fun to talk to than those - how young they seem! - who are still having the conversation about what A levels they got. That was, like, years ago ! (Or - God forbid - the ones who spent their year off working for an engineering firm in Swindon and who turn up at college with smug sponsorship cheques in their student account and rollerball pens in their breast pockets. This is not a valid use of your year off.) A gap year is for being bold, adventurous, wild - and, in some cases, altruistic. The great advantage of voluntary work, apart from the spiritual rewards and the warm glow inside that comes from helping others, is that people are more likely to give you money if they think you're teaching poor children how to read than if they think you're spending it on skunk and tequila. (Which is not to say that you can't do both.) It also gives you the chance to engage with the local people and become part of a community in a way that is impossible if you only pass through with a backpack. The key is to find an organisation that is not too rigid in its structures and rules, so that you can combine the hard work with the kind of self-exploration and experimentation that is the main point of a gap year. Unless you're exceptionally lucky - or rich - you'll leave university with at least \u00a35,000 of debt, get sucked into the relentless carousel of job interviews, acquire more debt, and carefree travelling will become an impossible luxury. My advice would be: go while you've got the chance - build schools, climb mountains, learn to dive, learn a language, smoke dope, drink too much and have a fantastic time. Find yourself. Just don't find yourself in an office... Ten facts about gap years 150,000, or one in five, students take a gap year before entering university 2 35,000 are state school leavers and 15,000 are from independent schools. 30% are women travelling alone. 3 Only 10,000 of the 200,000 people aged 26 and under who take gap years embark on a structured placement. 4 More than half of all school leavers taking gap years remain in Europe; one in 10 visits Central or South America. 5 Australia is the most popular destination among older travellers, with one-fifth spending most of their time there. 6 The least popular destination is Africa. 7 Asia is popular among all age groups. On average, 14% of British travellers visit the Far East. 8 Of those returning from trips, 70% say they would go again. Two-thirds claim that their gap-year experience has changed them. 9 One-third of people taking a gap year travel alone, and nearly half set off with just one companion; 20% of backpackers do not return with the person they left with. 10 \u00a32,000 is the average spent on a six-month trip. The biggest problem for those wishing to take a gap year is raising enough money; the second biggest problem is securing a visa. Research by Ben Cooper",

Even the aftershow party, sponsored by Ann Summers and featuring cocktail waitresses in bondage gear, is a good laugh, which is definitely not normal. </p> <p>And, in fact, they don't just have one song - because their new single, 'The Ballad of Chasey Lain', is pretty good too. It's not really a ballad, of course. That would be, like, sad.

      "body": "<p>A few years ago, interviewing the actress Susan Sarandon, I asked her if she minded getting older. She turned her beautiful face, with its tiger eyes, towards me and answered rather scornfully. 'Tell me, what's the alternative to getting older? Death!' </p> <p>Which is splendidly to the point, but misses the point as well. Because many, even most, of us - while not wanting to stay in the same place and not wanting to die - are yet fearful of getting older. We do try and prevent it. We dress young, speak in the language of youth, listen to the same music as our children, no longer move through life in the measured stages of previous generations, nor understand the concept of being 'grown up'. For tomorrow is for the young. On the front of magazines are young faces, glossy bodies, models who look like waifs and like children. Youth is seen as a valuable commodity, age as a time of diminishing returns. In our fast-moving, youth-obsessed, short-shelf-life culture, the old are often undervalued, neglected, almost invisible. </p> <p>The process of moving from youth to old age can feel like a journey into invisibility. When you are old, you are expected by the cruel clich\u00e9s of society to give things up: desire and desirability, ambition, eagerness, passion, anger, beauty, selfishness, hope. In return for this, the old are expected to attain a weary kind of wisdom and peace. 'When you are old and grey and full of sleep, and nodding by the fire...' No wonder we fear this journey, which seems to be all about loss. </p> <p>I don't know when the fear begins, or why it kicks in. Is it when we approach a milestone year - 40, say, or when we realise that the pattern of our life is set, and we can see into the future as if we are looking along a Roman road, all the way to the horizon, or when we realise that possibilities are closing down? Is it when our parents die and we step into that front line? When our children no longer need us? Or is there simply a day when we have a spasm of knowledge felt in the bones that we are on a one-way journey? There's no way back. Sometimes I wake in the night with my heart racing. I lie there in the dark and wait for the terror to slow down. I used to think I was scared of death, but now I think it's more a fear of life bolting away from me like this, which isn't quite the same thing. </p> <p>We spend our childhood waiting to become adults; can't wait to grow up. We spend much of our adulthood looking back with nostalgia at ourselves when we were young and time seemed infinite, and we had no sense that the runaway years would gallop past so quickly. There's a reason for this, of course: we measure our life against the life we have already had, the life that lies behind us. For a child, one year may be a quarter of their conscious existence; for an old person, it may be only one or two per cent, the tiniest shred of time. </p> <p>For the past few years, since my mid-thirties perhaps, I have found getting older a confusing business. It's not that I dislike it, or deny it, or try to prevent it. In many ways, I rather love it - that sense of not caring so much about what people think, that freedom from embarrassment and insecurity and shame. I am happier than I was, more confident, I think I know myself better. But nevertheless, I look in the mirror and am taken aback by the woman I see - can this be me, this creased face, a furrow between my eyes, fillings in my teeth, a tired skin? And where did the person go that I was, careless of risk and waste? </p> <p>I'm taken aback when young teenagers hide their cigarettes behind their backs. I find it hard to believe that those job ads for recent college graduates no longer apply to me. It is as if all the people that I was now exist only in photo albums, like exhibits in a gallery: the baby, the toddler, the child, the teenager, the young woman. They've all been eaten up by the person I have become. </p> <p>As the Dutch biologist, Midas Dekkers, writes in his playfully disturbing book The Way of All Flesh: a Celebration of Decay , 'your body is your museum to yourself'. While the body is continually reconstructed - during a lifetime, every part is replaced by a replica of itself dozens and dozens of times over - the mind is like an 'attic full of dusty memories'. Memory is our only continuity. </p> <p>A blink ago, my world was all possibility, doors that I might push open, whereas now it is equally about memory. All the things I've done that I will never do again: learn how to ride a bike, do cartwheels on the lawn, feel dizzy with excitement because it's my birthday, fall in love for the first time, leave home, wear a miniskirt, drink too much without getting a hangover, stay up all night without feeling ruined, give birth, hold my baby bunched up mewling under my chin. </p> <p>I sometimes wake in the morning with a slight stiffness in my body, like a premonition. Children become alarming yardsticks of time passing. I look at my parents and realise all over again that they are getting old now, though I persist in thinking of them as my age, in thinking of myself as only just beyond childhood, with the world spread out before me. I look at my friends who are my age and realise that they are approaching middle age, or in it, and if they are, then... I look in the mirror, and I think: it's too soon. I am not ready for this. But are we ever ready for this? </p> <p> From an alarmingly young age, we begin to decay. Dekkers charts in his book how we wear out ('the flowering of wrinkles. The withering of flowers...'). Bones creak and calcify, joints become less supple, vertebrae degenerate until we are like old cars headed for the scrapheap. Antibodies become less efficient. Skin becomes less pliant, until it gathers in bags and pouches on our face. Hair gets thinner, falls out. Lung capacity decreases (between the age of 20 to 80, by an average of 40 per cent). The heart beats less strongly. </p> <p>Women begin their life with one million eggs in their ovaries, but by 20, they only have one quarter left; by 40, just a few tens of thousands, if we're lucky. Our teeth decay (I've always thought mortality begins in the mouth) and fall out. Hearing deteriorates. Eyesight. Taste. </p> <p>Brain cells cascade away - 50,000 each day, so that by the end of an average life-span we will have lost an ounce of brain. We fight this decay with health foods, with exercise, with vitamins, with pills and potions, with diets, with drugs. Anything, really, that promises to stop time. But time won't stop. There's no way to cheat the clock. The only way is forward, towards age and death. </p> <p>Above all, we wage a war upon our faces, where the process of ageing becomes visible, public. Actually, the skin we see is already dead. It flakes away, as if in life we are turning to dust. It does no good to rub rejuvenating cream into it (which I nevertheless do every evening). We may cover it with make-up, paint a face that we want on to the face that is starting to remind us where we are headed. But make-up can't hide the ravages of time. You have to do more than colour it in. </p> <p>For a week, I went without any make-up. This is a trivial thing, of course, but I wanted to see how I'd feel without preparing my image to face the world. I don't put make-up on at home, anyway, but when I go to work or out to a party, it feels necessary to stand in front of a mirror and rub in foundation so my skin doesn't look blotchy, to apply eye-liner so my eyes look larger, to put on mascara, lipstick. </p> <p>Without that ritual - a ritual I used to watch my mother going through; the way she would lean forward to stare into her own eyes, the way she'd press her lipsticked mouth against a tissue, leaving a red kiss on it - I feel a bit naked. I feel vulnerable in front of other people, not the woman I want to be, but the woman I am and don't feel entirely confident about. </p> <p>Theoretically, I want to look my age. George Orwell famously said that at 50 you have the face you deserve - I'm not 50, but nevertheless I do want to earn my face. I want the life I have had to show in my lines and wrinkles; in my stretch marks from being four times pregnant; in my scars and blemishes. I want to own my imperfections, not hide them as if time hadn't marked me at all. Faces become more interesting as they get older - and more beautiful. </p> <p>I firmly believe all that - yet I stand in front of the mirror, day after day, gazing at the soft skin under my eyes, the forlorn lines around my mouth. I want to hide. </p> <p>Apparently, with cosmetic surgery you should really have it done before you need it. If you wait until there is crepey skin under the eyes, a mournful downward tug to the mouth when you are tired, tiny cross-stitching above your upper lip, the first traces of a double chin, then you have left it a bit late. And such is our terror of growing older, of looking the age that we are, such is our difficulty in finding beauty in experience, that it doesn't seem extraordinary to us that thousands of women go under the knife to be stitched into the semblance of youth. </p> <p>Ribcages are reduced. Lips inflated. Thighs liposuctioned. Bits of the self are lopped off and chucked away. Women seem to panic. 'We must learn to love our bodies,' said Jane Fonda, shortly before having herself drastically remade by the cosmetic surgeon. Julie Christie succumbed to cosmetic surgery because she suddenly noticed that in Hollywood she was starting to look older than women who were older than her. </p> <p>Midlife crises hit as we look ahead at life, as it stretches towards old age and death, and say: is this all there is? The menopause - all those hormones charging round the body - often makes women feel jittery, panicky, hot, weepy, dreary and scared. But it also makes us depressed because the change reminds us how we are crossing over a line - from fecundity to barrenness. No wonder so many women have late pregnancies: it's a way of holding back the stages of life, trying to stay put. For older women are no longer objects of desire. Germaine Greer wrote how this was a freedom for her, liberated at last from the ceaseless tyranny of men's lust and her own desire, but for many women it's a kind of terror. We are so used to being judged by how we look and so used to being noticed. Nowadays, when I walk down the road with my eldest daughter, who is nearly 12, it is her that young men are looking at, not me. I'm passing on the baton. This is how it should be and that's how I want it to be. So why do I feel so proud of her, but so peculiar about me? </p> <p>There's another kind of change for men. Where women get depressed, and turn in on themselves, men often do the opposite, turn outwards and smash up their old life to create an entirely new one. They panic. They go jogging with their fear running after them, fall in love with a younger woman, leave the old and known for the youthful, the unfamiliar, the exciting. For a time they can feel that they have begun again. As Groucho Marx said: 'Men are as old as the women they feel.' But time won't let them get away with that for long - their new life becomes old too; their new wife ages as well. They need another one. Another. The clock still ticks. </p> <p>Are we more scared of getting older than we used to be? I think so. Maybe this is partly - and paradoxically - because we now expect to get older, whereas in the past we couldn't take it for granted at all. It used to be unusual to go grey, to retire, to become senile. There was a sense of the precariousness of life, which could end at any time - and often did end very young. There was a sense of the extraordinariness of old age. </p> <p>In nineteenth-century Ireland, for example, parents used to give each of their sons their father's name, to make it more likely that at least one child would carry it on. Death was expected all the time, and so you were alive right to the edge of the grave. Now, we place dying in what we think of as a logical position - at the close of a long life, unless we are unlucky. </p> <p>At the same time as we are living longer and longer, there has never been a time, in the Western world, when we have denied age and death as we do today. We want to live longer still, a thousand years, forever. The meaning of life is radically wrenched by this great denial. Once we valued age and wisdom; now we value youth, newness, and we dread old age, the lines on the face, life marking us, experience burdening us: not just closer to death, but further away from what we think of as life. </p> <p>Instead of thinking of the elderly as full of years, it is as if the more years we have, the emptier of life we become - we are using it up, running out of life and of time. But actually, by trying to stay young we don't prolong youth at all, we do the opposite. We deny ourselves the pleasure of all the selves we may become, stage by stage, all the experience we gather. 'The older you get,' says Dekkers, 'the more you come to resemble yourself.' In his view, we are always moving and changing towards the person that we really are: the self at the end of the line. </p> <p>Yet still I think: how quickly it's gone, the first half of my life. One minute I was lying under the copper beech in my parents' garden, watching the way the light fell through the leaves, dreaming of what I would be, one day an unbearably long way off, when I would be grown up. </p> <p>Now here I am, a grey hair in my eyebrow. Where did time go? Is it really true it isn't coming back? </p> <p><strong>The best years of out lives</strong></p> <p><strong> Sylvia Ratcliffe, 62</strong> I feel there's not a lot of time left. I do calculations about when my grandchildren are a certain age, and I'll be gone. I feel energetic and enthusiastic to learn, and I feel the same inside despite the creeping years. One of my biggest fears, though, is memory loss. </p> <p><strong> Caroline Rogers, 36</strong> I definitely feel like I'm going through the ageing process. I'm much more willing to spend money on my appearance to maintain the looks that I previously took for granted. I recently caught sight of myself in a mirror smiling and was shocked by the crows' feet round my eyes. When people guess my age as being less than it is, I feel like a cat that has just been stroked, which is ridiculous. </p> <p><strong> Robert Hokum, 49</strong> In the workplace a man in his forties must be in a respected position or he is seen as a sad old duffer. </p> <p>Older women can still be very sexy, for them style and allure is more important than youth. I think you know you're getting old when you start to think June Whitfield is attractive. But if you plan your life right, you see a level of economic freedom which has previously been unknown in your life. </p> <p><strong> Gordon Agar, 38</strong> When I was a teen I didn't think I would live to be old, but then I thought 30 was old. As a gay man, I might clock a guy and turn round to have another look. When I was younger more often than not the other person would turn round and have a look as well. Now it doesn't happen so much. But I'm more concerned with my image than about getting old. There's no excuse for not looking good. </p> <p><strong> Katrina Heart, 26</strong> I'm terrified of getting old because men are attracted to younger women, not fortysomething women. When I hit 26, I thought that's it, I'm only ever going to look worse from now on. Also you can't get away from the fact that this society values youth and youthful good looks. If I wrote my first novel at 35, nobody would be really interested. But if I wrote it at 25, it would be different. Wisdom is a nice consolation of age, but if I could make a pact like Dorian Gray and stay 22 forever, I would happily miss out on the advantages of later life. </p> <p><strong> William Johnson, 29</strong> I turn 30 next week and I am starting to get a stiff back and my body doesn't recover from a hangover so quickly, but people still think I look like a teenager anyway. I like the idea of getting old. You get wiser as you get older and I feel more secure and happy than I did at 21. I'm looking forward to being a grouchy old man. <br> Interviews by Kim Bunce</p>",

      "bodyText": "A few years ago, interviewing the actress Susan Sarandon, I asked her if she minded getting older. She turned her beautiful face, with its tiger eyes, towards me and answered rather scornfully. 'Tell me, what's the alternative to getting older? Death!' Which is splendidly to the point, but misses the point as well. Because many, even most, of us - while not wanting to stay in the same place and not wanting to die - are yet fearful of getting older. We do try and prevent it. We dress young, speak in the language of youth, listen to the same music as our children, no longer move through life in the measured stages of previous generations, nor understand the concept of being 'grown up'. For tomorrow is for the young. On the front of magazines are young faces, glossy bodies, models who look like waifs and like children. Youth is seen as a valuable commodity, age as a time of diminishing returns. In our fast-moving, youth-obsessed, short-shelf-life culture, the old are often undervalued, neglected, almost invisible. The process of moving from youth to old age can feel like a journey into invisibility. When you are old, you are expected by the cruel clich\u00e9s of society to give things up: desire and desirability, ambition, eagerness, passion, anger, beauty, selfishness, hope. In return for this, the old are expected to attain a weary kind of wisdom and peace. 'When you are old and grey and full of sleep, and nodding by the fire...' No wonder we fear this journey, which seems to be all about loss. I don't know when the fear begins, or why it kicks in. Is it when we approach a milestone year - 40, say, or when we realise that the pattern of our life is set, and we can see into the future as if we are looking along a Roman road, all the way to the horizon, or when we realise that possibilities are closing down? Is it when our parents die and we step into that front line? When our children no longer need us? Or is there simply a day when we have a spasm of knowledge felt in the bones that we are on a one-way journey? There's no way back. Sometimes I wake in the night with my heart racing. I lie there in the dark and wait for the terror to slow down. I used to think I was scared of death, but now I think it's more a fear of life bolting away from me like this, which isn't quite the same thing. We spend our childhood waiting to become adults; can't wait to grow up. We spend much of our adulthood looking back with nostalgia at ourselves when we were young and time seemed infinite, and we had no sense that the runaway years would gallop past so quickly. There's a reason for this, of course: we measure our life against the life we have already had, the life that lies behind us. For a child, one year may be a quarter of their conscious existence; for an old person, it may be only one or two per cent, the tiniest shred of time. For the past few years, since my mid-thirties perhaps, I have found getting older a confusing business. It's not that I dislike it, or deny it, or try to prevent it. In many ways, I rather love it - that sense of not caring so much about what people think, that freedom from embarrassment and insecurity and shame. I am happier than I was, more confident, I think I know myself better. But nevertheless, I look in the mirror and am taken aback by the woman I see - can this be me, this creased face, a furrow between my eyes, fillings in my teeth, a tired skin? And where did the person go that I was, careless of risk and waste? I'm taken aback when young teenagers hide their cigarettes behind their backs. I find it hard to believe that those job ads for recent college graduates no longer apply to me. It is as if all the people that I was now exist only in photo albums, like exhibits in a gallery: the baby, the toddler, the child, the teenager, the young woman. They've all been eaten up by the person I have become. As the Dutch biologist, Midas Dekkers, writes in his playfully disturbing book The Way of All Flesh: a Celebration of Decay , 'your body is your museum to yourself'. While the body is continually reconstructed - during a lifetime, every part is replaced by a replica of itself dozens and dozens of times over - the mind is like an 'attic full of dusty memories'. Memory is our only continuity. A blink ago, my world was all possibility, doors that I might push open, whereas now it is equally about memory. All the things I've done that I will never do again: learn how to ride a bike, do cartwheels on the lawn, feel dizzy with excitement because it's my birthday, fall in love for the first time, leave home, wear a miniskirt, drink too much without getting a hangover, stay up all night without feeling ruined, give birth, hold my baby bunched up mewling under my chin. I sometimes wake in the morning with a slight stiffness in my body, like a premonition. Children become alarming yardsticks of time passing.

      "body": "<p>Delphine looked like a doll. She had a bob of black hair, shining eyes and a rosebud mouth that seemed painted onto her face. Her clothes were perfection. I remember the smocked dress she wore when I first saw her: cherries against a white background. When I first came to be Delphine's au pair, I had never been in charge of a child before but had a broad experience of looking after dolls.

      "body": "<p>After just two matches, the only First Division teams with 100 per cent records are Fulham, Preston and Watford. </p> <p>That Watford are members of this select club is due to their young Irish striker Dominic Foley. He came on as a substitute against Barnsley seven minutes from the end, in place of the injured Michael Ngonge, and scored the only goal with a left-foot shot from outside the box in stoppage time. </p> <p>Of the teams who might have been expected also to be in this 100 per cent bracket, it was perhaps inevitable that Blackburn should falter - through a goalless draw at Crewe - in view of the cloud that has descended upon the club following the death of Jack Walker. </p> <p>Blackburn's manager, Graeme Souness, said: 'The players did their best in the circumstances, but I thought their minds weren't entirely on the game. Maybe some of them didn't know Jack that well but the aura of the man was huge and his memory will always be around the club and the training ground. </p> <p>'They were quiet at training yesterday and at the hotel last night. Today, they did not really get going until after half-time, and then they could easily have won it. They were disappointed because they wanted to win it for him and the fans.' </p> <p>While Watford were inspiring early confidence in their chances of bouncing straight back to the Premiership, their relegation partners, Sheffield Wednesday and Wimbledon, were given a sharp reminder of how difficult it will be for them in their new environment, with defeats at the hands of Huddersfield and Burnley respectively. </p> <p>Neither have won a match in the First Division, and Wimbledon have yet to score. Wednesday's 3-2 defeat will have been particularly difficult to take, given that it was on their own ground. </p> <p>Still, they did well to recover from 3-0 down; and one had to sympathise with their defender Ashley Westwood for missing arguably the easiest of equalising chances. Arriving unmarked by the back post, Westwood, who has been signed on loan from Bradford, was caught in two minds about whether to head the ball or kick it. Eventually, he made contact with it with his stomach, and diverted the ball onto a post. Wednesday's manager, Paul Jewell, said: 'I am depressed but at least the players did not throw in the towel and kept going until the end.' </p> <p>Norwich, who sold their leading striker Craig Bellamy to Coventry, also had a finishing problem in their goalless draw at home to Nottingham Forest.

      "bodyText": "After just two matches, the only First Division teams with 100 per cent records are Fulham, Preston and Watford. That Watford are members of this select club is due to their young Irish striker Dominic Foley. He came on as a substitute against Barnsley seven minutes from the end, in place of the injured Michael Ngonge, and scored the only goal with a left-foot shot from outside the box in stoppage time. Of the teams who might have been expected also to be in this 100 per cent bracket, it was perhaps inevitable that Blackburn should falter - through a goalless draw at Crewe - in view of the cloud that has descended upon the club following the death of Jack Walker. Blackburn's manager, Graeme Souness, said: 'The players did their best in the circumstances, but I thought their minds weren't entirely on the game. Maybe some of them didn't know Jack that well but the aura of the man was huge and his memory will always be around the club and the training ground. 'They were quiet at training yesterday and at the hotel last night. Today, they did not really get going until after half-time, and then they could easily have won it. They were disappointed because they wanted to win it for him and the fans.' While Watford were inspiring early confidence in their chances of bouncing straight back to the Premiership, their relegation partners, Sheffield Wednesday and Wimbledon, were given a sharp reminder of how difficult it will be for them in their new environment, with defeats at the hands of Huddersfield and Burnley respectively. Neither have won a match in the First Division, and Wimbledon have yet to score. Wednesday's 3-2 defeat will have been particularly difficult to take, given that it was on their own ground. Still, they did well to recover from 3-0 down; and one had to sympathise with their defender Ashley Westwood for missing arguably the easiest of equalising chances. Arriving unmarked by the back post, Westwood, who has been signed on loan from Bradford, was caught in two minds about whether to head the ball or kick it. Eventually, he made contact with it with his stomach, and diverted the ball onto a post. Wednesday's manager, Paul Jewell, said: 'I am depressed but at least the players did not throw in the towel and kept going until the end.' Norwich, who sold their leading striker Craig Bellamy to Coventry, also had a finishing problem in their goalless draw at home to Nottingham Forest. But instead of lambasting their team for the failure to score their first goals of the season, Norwich fans had greater cause to praise the part that Forest's 41-year-old goalkeeper, Dave Beasant, played. Forest's manager, David Platt, said: 'Beasant made three or four good saves and there were some good blocks. He's always been a good goalkeeper.

'We accommodate more away fans than most grounds, but we still can't get enough of our own supporters in,' he said. 'When I came here we used to take 15,000 to Sheffield Wednesday, but when capacities started to be reduced for safety reasons away fans had to be limited. There's no perfect solution, but you have to draw the line somewhere.

The fact that the visitors are relatively low-key opponents matters not a jot - both Uniteds are in the position of turning away supporters for every home game and Newcastle are confidently predicting a sell-out. The Magpies cannot physically make their present home much bigger; awkward considerations such as a Metro station at one end and listed buildings at the other rule out further construction for the foreseeable future, but if it were merely a matter of satisfying demand Newcastle would also be approaching a crowd record of 68,386. </p> <p>This sort of ever-upward progress is barely considered remarkable in the ninth season of the Premier League, except by supporters struggling to keep up with the cost of it all and players lucky enough to have had their financial horizons expanded beyond all expectation in the past eight, dizzying years. Players like Warren Barton, of Newcastle, who went from the crazy, but cash-strapped, Wimbledon gang to discover real football madness in the North-East. </p> <p>Barton's former clubmate Carl Cort has just made the same journey, but the difference is that in his first-team career, the younger player has only known Premiership standards. And as Barton says, by the time Wimbledon were relegated they had actually stopped being the Premiership's ugly ducklings and turned into quite a respectable, well-supported club with gates averaging about 20,000. </p> <p>It wasn't quite like that in Barton's time with the Dons, and not just his pre-Premiership time either. It is an obvious truism that the advent of the Premier League has transformed what went before, but what is less commonly realised is how different the Premiership is now to what it was seven or eight years ago. 'What everyone said at the time was that nothing had really changed,' Barton explained. 'It's funny, but you don't hear anyone saying that any more.' </p> <p>Though practically ever-present for Wimbledon in the first Premier League season, Barton managed to miss the home game against Oldham Athletic on 12 December 1992. He was not the only one. The 'crowd' of 3,386 still stands as the Premiership's lowest, a record which current trends suggest will stand for some time. It is not just that crowds are up, it is that clubs like Wimbledon and Oldham are undeniably down. Barton naturally feels Wimbledon will be back in the big time before long, but not even the most bonkers of Boundary Park die-hards thinks that about Oldham. Even Wimbledon, for all their fighting qualities, may discover that getting back into the Premiership is nothing like as easy as cracking the old First Division. </p> <p>It was not immediately apparent in 1992, but within the last eight years most of the predictions have come true. The Premiership has become predominantly a place for big clubs, with big grounds, in big cities. There are exceptions to the rule, notably Everton and Tottenham, but the rich have got richer, to such an extent that the Manchester United manager last week said he would be 'shocked' if anyone from outside the perceived top five managed to win the league. Perhaps that was always the case, but clubs the size of Aston Villa or Newcastle ought to be able to at least dream of the title. The perception of a league within a league is now stronger than ever, though it is not all the Premiership's fault. Uefa's Champions League deserves at least half the blame. </p> <p>Barton has played in the Champions League, battled relegation, worked under four different managers in five seasons and lost two successive FA Cup finals, but says he has never regretted leaving London for the North. 'I wouldn't change a minute, I can't complain about a single thing,' he said. </p> <p>'I would never have imagined I would be spending so much of my career so far from home, or that I would have enjoyed it so much, but I've told Carl [Cort] that this could be the best move he's made. </p> <p>'Getting out of London helped me concentrate on my football. You come up to a place like this and you don't know anybody, people are a bit suspicious of you in fact, and you have to prove yourself. </p> <p>'All you can do is work hard and focus on your football, and of course that's what you should be doing. Carl will be fine. He's an honest player and the fans will love him because he'll never put his head down. He's played in front of big crowds before, of course, just like I had. But it's a bit different when they are all for rather than against you. Nice, but different. It takes a bit of getting used to. So do crowds of two or three thousand at training sessions, something else that never used to happen at Wimbledon.' </p> <p>According to Barton, the Premiership has not only become much faster, it has become much more intense and the stakes are high. Fortunately, so are the wages. You do not need to tell Barton how lucky he is, he will be too busy anyway, investing his small fortune in a myriad of new business plans for the future. </p> <p>'The rewards are like never before, but that's what you work for,' he said. 'It's not easy holding down a place at a top Premiership club, especially if they keep changing the manager. I've had my ups and downs, but I think I give good value and I'm proud I've never been discarded. Kevin Keegan originally made me an offer I couldn't refuse. Not with money, he just said, \"Come on the journey,\" and made it sound like the most exciting thing in the world. He wasn't far wrong either.'</p>",

      "byline": "Neasa MacErlean",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>As a nation we take seven days off sick each year on average. But more and more employers are becoming sceptical about our absences and taking measures to reduce them. They have a point. Research conducted by the IRS publication Employee Health Bulletin suggests that much sick leave is cultural or emotional, rather than physical. </p> <p> 'Absence levels within organisations vary widely between departments, sections and work groups,' conclude the authors of the research. The survey of 182 employers also found that women take more time off than men; that managers take less time off through sickness than other employees; and that absence rates are higher in large companies than small ones and higher in the public sector than in private businesses. </p> <p> The country's largest private sector employer, Tesco, has concluded that there are many attitudinal factors in taking sick leave. 'If you don't think you are likely to be missed, you are more likely to take time off,' says Keith Luxon, human resources policy manager. A year ago, Tesco's absenteeism rate was 5.8 per cent. Now it is down by a fifth to 4.6 per cent. </p> <p> This follows the implementation of new 'attendance management procedures'. As a result, some of the supermarket chain's 175,000 workers have been dismissed because of the time they have taken off sick. Some may think this a harsh approach, but Tesco is happy to talk about its reasons. 'We wanted more openness and honesty about absence,' says Luxon. 'We are operating in an incredibly tight market, which is forcing us to control costs wherever we can. Absenteeism was costing us between \u00a330 million and \u00a340m a year, and it was impacting on customer service. If you operate with 5.8 per cent of your staff away, you have fewer tills open and fewer goods on the shelf.' </p> <p> Every Tesco employee who takes sick leave of any duration has to have a 'return to work' interview with one of the store managers. In a substantial number of cases, it has emerged that the person was off for domestic or family reasons - looking after a sick child, for example. If this is the case, the employee is given various options about how they want to treat that time: it could be taken as holiday, as unpaid leave, or set off against overtime, but they will not get it for free. </p> <p> People who have two periods of sickness within 24 weeks are then drawn into the 'attendance management' process, where their attendance is monitored. If they then have a third absence, or if their total time off sick goes above 5 per cent, they are interviewed again and banned from doing overtime for six weeks. </p> <p> In the interview, they will be asked more about their time off - whether there are common patterns to the different periods of illness. Occupational health services will be made available if a pattern is established - if, for example, they are suffering from repeated back trouble or if they want to space their shifts out differently. If over the next 12 weeks their sickness record does not improve, they get another interview and probably a verbal warning. They will be told: 'We can't run a business effectively on this level of absence.' </p> <p> If within the next eight weeks there is no improvement in absenteeism levels, they could get a final written warning, and then it is possible that they could be sacked. Tesco says it has tried to be fair and open with staff. An employee will not have to go through this process if there is a clear medical problem. Employment lawyer Michael Burd of solicitor Lewis Silkin believes that many other employers will follow this type of example.

      "bodyText": "As a nation we take seven days off sick each year on average. But more and more employers are becoming sceptical about our absences and taking measures to reduce them. They have a point. Research conducted by the IRS publication Employee Health Bulletin suggests that much sick leave is cultural or emotional, rather than physical. 'Absence levels within organisations vary widely between departments, sections and work groups,' conclude the authors of the research. The survey of 182 employers also found that women take more time off than men; that managers take less time off through sickness than other employees; and that absence rates are higher in large companies than small ones and higher in the public sector than in private businesses. The country's largest private sector employer, Tesco, has concluded that there are many attitudinal factors in taking sick leave. 'If you don't think you are likely to be missed, you are more likely to take time off,' says Keith Luxon, human resources policy manager. A year ago, Tesco's absenteeism rate was 5.8 per cent. Now it is down by a fifth to 4.6 per cent. This follows the implementation of new 'attendance management procedures'. As a result, some of the supermarket chain's 175,000 workers have been dismissed because of the time they have taken off sick. Some may think this a harsh approach, but Tesco is happy to talk about its reasons. 'We wanted more openness and honesty about absence,' says Luxon. 'We are operating in an incredibly tight market, which is forcing us to control costs wherever we can. Absenteeism was costing us between \u00a330 million and \u00a340m a year, and it was impacting on customer service. If you operate with 5.8 per cent of your staff away, you have fewer tills open and fewer goods on the shelf.' Every Tesco employee who takes sick leave of any duration has to have a 'return to work' interview with one of the store managers. In a substantial number of cases, it has emerged that the person was off for domestic or family reasons - looking after a sick child, for example. If this is the case, the employee is given various options about how they want to treat that time: it could be taken as holiday, as unpaid leave, or set off against overtime, but they will not get it for free. People who have two periods of sickness within 24 weeks are then drawn into the 'attendance management' process, where their attendance is monitored. If they then have a third absence, or if their total time off sick goes above 5 per cent, they are interviewed again and banned from doing overtime for six weeks. In the interview, they will be asked more about their time off - whether there are common patterns to the different periods of illness. Occupational health services will be made available if a pattern is established - if, for example, they are suffering from repeated back trouble or if they want to space their shifts out differently. If over the next 12 weeks their sickness record does not improve, they get another interview and probably a verbal warning. They will be told: 'We can't run a business effectively on this level of absence.' If within the next eight weeks there is no improvement in absenteeism levels, they could get a final written warning, and then it is possible that they could be sacked. Tesco says it has tried to be fair and open with staff. An employee will not have to go through this process if there is a clear medical problem. Employment lawyer Michael Burd of solicitor Lewis Silkin believes that many other employers will follow this type of example. Persistent or repeated sickness is one of the most difficult issues for employers to deal with at the moment, he says. 'Doctors seem all too ready to dish out medical certificates giving quite vague reasons for an inability to work.' Burd says he is constantly dealing with medical reports which say simply 'stress', 'hypertension and work-related stress' or even 'work-related stress _ Mr X should not return to work until the problems there are resolved'. He adds: 'Doctors are doing this with the best interests of their patients in mind. But they sometimes just take that person's word for it. And they have no concept of the kind of legal problems this approach can lead to.' He has frequently seen businesses come under great pressure when a staff member is suddenly signed off for two months. Unless the employment contract states that the employer can get an independent medical assessment, the employee is protected. Under the confidentiality rules for patients, doctors can not give out any personal information unless they have the patient's consent. Even when consent is given, the doctors are often not forthcoming. Burd quotes the following 'report' he received from a GP: 'X attended my surgery on X date. I formed the opinion she was unfit to return to work as a result of that consultation. Yours sincerely...' Another part of the reason why employers are clamping down where they can is the Disability Discrimination Act. This gives a lot of protection to employees who have long-term illnesses, which could last for more than a year.

      "body": "<p>Britain's 25 million workers have received a substantial boost in the last few years as a raft of employment law reforms set a minimum wage, protected part-timers, helped the disabled and introduced many other valuable benefits. </p> <p>But, for many workers, the changes are theoretical and have not improved their lives. Perhaps the worst aspect of the employment infrastructure is a lack of enforcement by the Government and a refusal by businesses to observe the new regulations. </p> <p>The problem is 'huge', says the Low Pay Unit, which sends floods of unhappy workers to get help from citizens advice bureaux. </p> <p>Employment law is getting so complex that many employees do not appreciate their own rights. Today, for instance, could be a red letter day for some women, even though few probably realise it. In a change to our notoriously complicated maternity rules, many women whose babies were expected to be born from today will get a more generous entitlement to maternity pay and leave. A new mother can now receive 18 weeks' pay and leave even if she has worked for her employer for less than two years. Until now, those with shorter service were only entitled to 14 weeks. </p> <p>The maternity allowance - a weekly payment for mothers earning between \u00a330 and \u00a366 a week - also becomes more generous. But claimants have to have pay slips going back for more than a year to calculate the amount due to them, and many employers break the law by not issuing any. </p> <p>One of the easiest issues to deal with is the minimum wage - \u00a33.60 an hour for workers aged over 21, and \u00a33.20 for those aged between 18 and 21. The Inland Revenue polices this legislation through a compliance department. If an employer is paying too little, workers can ring a hotline number (0845 6000 678) and demand an investigation. </p> <p>The Revenue has put right many wrongs in this way, but it takes a narrow view of its job. If the employer has committed a breach of contract - say by reducing an employee's hours to meet the hourly rate threshold - the Revenue will not investigate the issue since, superficially, the law is being obeyed. </p> <p>But having compliance officers is very rare for any legislation. In most areas, the only help given with enforcement by the Government is the chance to claim at an employment tribunal. Jeff Masters of the Low Pay Unit says this is only a last resort: 'Informal ways of enforcing your rights are always the best ways. The employment relationship is still a relationship. Going to an employment tribunal can be like taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut.' </p> <p>The advice bureaux tend to agree. 'Employers can turn nasty and dismiss you,' says one adviser. 'So if you win in an employment tribunal, it could be a Pyrrhic victory. And in most cases - perhaps seven out of 10 - a worker will be looking for a reference, which is going to be harder to get in these circumstances. And the next employer might not look favourably on someone who took their last employer to a tribunal.' </p> <p>Many employees who are getting short-changed have little ability to fight back, according to Anna Barlow of the Acton Law Shop, a free advisory service in west London. Their English might not be good or they might be working illegally 'A lot of people just decide to keep their head down and put up with it,' she says. </p> <p>It is not just the traditional cowboy employers who are breaking the law. A church cleaner of 20 years' standing recently accepted an out-of-court settlement from her employer, a Baptist church, which was paying her only \u00a340 a week for work that she said took 40 hours. Since the church also provided accommodation, it regarded the payments to her as just pocket money. </p> <p>Many honest, middle class families in Britain may be shocked to discover that they are breaking the law in the way they deal with their cleaners. Even if they assume that Ms Mopp is self-employed, a tribunal could easily decide differently. </p> <p>Anna Barlow, who is dealing with one such claim now, believes that people who retain cleaners or gardeners should pay the minimum wage, give notice if they want to end the relationship and consider giving four weeks' paid holiday a year. </p> <p>'It depends on the facts of each case,' she says. 'The likelihood is that these issues won't be raised by the cleaners but if something goes wrong you could find yourself in front of a tribunal. At the very least, there should be a discussion with the cleaner about the issue of employment.' </p> <p>The good news for some employees is that certain issues can be resolved just by providing the employer with more information. Small businesses in particular may not appreciate the way the law has changed. There is a common misapprehension, for instance, that employees do not get rights to paid holiday in their first three months of employment. While it is true that they cannot claim paid holidays if they leave after three months, they are entitled retrospectively to the full four weeks of paid holiday once they have been with the same employer for 12 months. </p> <p>Barlow has found that many employers are happy to do the right thing in these circumstances once they know what it is. </p> <p>Many employees will get what is due only if they educate their bosses. Like all pieces of new legislation, the regulations protecting part-timers will not have been implemented by all employers when they came into force at the beginning of July. </p> <p>But they do provide the right for part-timers to have the same hourly pay rate as full-timers doing the same job. </p> <p>This, sadly, is where the law is letting down many people. Some jobs - like those of school dinner ladies - are only ever done on a part-time basis. And this law has not been drawn up in a way that will help them. </p> <p>It will take years for the employment revolution that started with these reforms to be completed. Those who want to benefit may have to find their own ways of enforcing the new laws. </p> <p>\u0095 Low Pay Unit helpline: 020- 7713 7583 </p> <p><strong>Work for Mr D.

      "body": "<p>If you have ever felt murderous because the paperwork on your mortgage offer was delayed, you may, although it's too late, be interested in developments among larger lenders. </p> <p>Halifax will shortly launch a 'world-record beating' process, where borrowers can get a yes or a no in six minutes. The system will be part of the new Halifax internet and telephone offshoot Intelligent Finance (IF). </p> <p>Next month, Abbey National will also launch a speedier process for clients who come to them through intermediaries: they will get an offer 'in principle' within 'three to four minutes'. </p> <p>Many other lenders are also trying to improve their service, according to Frank Eve of E-loan, an internet mortgage service. 'Most lenders are working on a points-scoring system that can give \"in principle\" offers almost immediately,' he says. 'But it will be a year or two before most lenders have automated systems.' </p> <p>So why are lenders apparently so keen now to improve customer service? 'Service is becoming a big issue,' says David Hollingworth of London &amp; Country Mortgages. 'With no interest-rate movements, many lenders are thinking that borrowers might start deciding between them by thinking about how they are treated.' </p> <p>This is also the view of IF, whose ultimate aim is a 'same day mortgage', according to spokesman Stephen McCrory. 'Most people don't do anything to drive the process forward at the moment, but we are starting to see people who tell us they don't want a 14-page questionnaire, but service that is slick and snappy.' </p> <p>Abbey National is also dealing with people who want quick decisions. 'As they view a property, they sometimes want to know there and then if they can get a mortgage,' says spokesman Matt Young. </p> <p>This probably sounds very unfamiliar to homeowners who had to fight through mounds of bureaucracy to get a loan. Many mortgage admin systems have evolved into paperwork nightmares. Change is now coming because the technology is making it easy, and because there are new players in the market, such as IF and the internet banks. </p> <p>When you apply for a mortgage, the lender has to decide whether you are a safe bet to repay the money, and whether the house is worth lending money on. </p> <p>To answer the first question, lenders traditionally ask for an employer's reference stating the applicant's income and whether they are permanently employed. Increasingly, however, lenders ask the borrower to provide three months of pay slips and their last P60. </p> <p>What can annoy some borrowers is that a couple of weeks after they have provided pay slips, their employer is still asked for a reference. This can seem like slipshod administration. But what has happened is that the lender's 'underwriting department', which scrutinises mortgage applicants, will sometimes find a gap between the salary that the applicant professes to earn and the information on the payslips.

      "bodyText": "If you have ever felt murderous because the paperwork on your mortgage offer was delayed, you may, although it's too late, be interested in developments among larger lenders. Halifax will shortly launch a 'world-record beating' process, where borrowers can get a yes or a no in six minutes. The system will be part of the new Halifax internet and telephone offshoot Intelligent Finance (IF). Next month, Abbey National will also launch a speedier process for clients who come to them through intermediaries: they will get an offer 'in principle' within 'three to four minutes'. Many other lenders are also trying to improve their service, according to Frank Eve of E-loan, an internet mortgage service. 'Most lenders are working on a points-scoring system that can give \"in principle\" offers almost immediately,' he says. 'But it will be a year or two before most lenders have automated systems.' So why are lenders apparently so keen now to improve customer service? 'Service is becoming a big issue,' says David Hollingworth of London &amp; Country Mortgages. 'With no interest-rate movements, many lenders are thinking that borrowers might start deciding between them by thinking about how they are treated.' This is also the view of IF, whose ultimate aim is a 'same day mortgage', according to spokesman Stephen McCrory. 'Most people don't do anything to drive the process forward at the moment, but we are starting to see people who tell us they don't want a 14-page questionnaire, but service that is slick and snappy.' Abbey National is also dealing with people who want quick decisions. 'As they view a property, they sometimes want to know there and then if they can get a mortgage,' says spokesman Matt Young. This probably sounds very unfamiliar to homeowners who had to fight through mounds of bureaucracy to get a loan. Many mortgage admin systems have evolved into paperwork nightmares. Change is now coming because the technology is making it easy, and because there are new players in the market, such as IF and the internet banks. When you apply for a mortgage, the lender has to decide whether you are a safe bet to repay the money, and whether the house is worth lending money on. To answer the first question, lenders traditionally ask for an employer's reference stating the applicant's income and whether they are permanently employed. Increasingly, however, lenders ask the borrower to provide three months of pay slips and their last P60. What can annoy some borrowers is that a couple of weeks after they have provided pay slips, their employer is still asked for a reference. This can seem like slipshod administration. But what has happened is that the lender's 'underwriting department', which scrutinises mortgage applicants, will sometimes find a gap between the salary that the applicant professes to earn and the information on the payslips. These gaps are often caused by bonus schemes. In these instances, they often ask for more information - but neglect to tell the borrower why. IF, for one, is now hoping to cut this procedure to a minimum. In some cases, it will rely on an applicant's bank statements, showing their salary, whether they are overdrawn and how easily they meet their current financial liabilities. If lenders integrate their software, they can also collect information about creditworthiness at the drop of a hat. IF, Abbey and others now have systems which, at the click of a mouse, show a person's credit history and whether they are on the electoral roll. Their current home address can also provide valuable information. 'What is pushing these developments forward is the amount of information that can now be derived from a postcode,' says Eve of E-loan. If the lender can deduce from the postcode that you are applying for another loan from your current home in Millionaires' Row, they may drop some of the hurdles to let you through quickly. Eve also believes that many property valuations could soon be done on paper, rather than by sending a surveyor round - which can easily delay the mortgage offer by several days. If a lender regularly lends on houses in Wilberforce Road, it does not necessarily have to value each one individually, especially if a lot of postcode information is available.

      "body": "<p>When I leapt out of an aeroplane for the 27th time, it was, without doubt, the 27th most scary thing I had ever done. It was my last jump of a training course at Lake Elsinore Skydiving Center in southern California, arguably the best drop zone in the world. It had been an intense week, during which I faced overwhelming fear, my own mental and physical limitations and the sensory overload that hits you when you step outside a plane two miles up. And I wouldn't have missed it for the world. </p> <p>Driven irresistibly by a combination of mid-life crisis, dreams of flying and, bizarrely, a fear of heights, I booked up for an AFF course run in the United States by British company PhD Skydiving. AFF stands for Accelerated Freefall, but I was relieved to hear that \"accelerated\" refers not to the speed with which I was likely to hit the ground, but the rapid rate of learning. </p> <p>This system takes you directly to 45 seconds of freefall on your first exit from the plane at 12,000ft, albeit with two instructors holding on to you very firmly until they are sure you have safely pulled your ripcord. You then receive instructions on a walkie-talkie to help you land. </p> <p>There were three things I had to learn before I could be considered safe. The first was acquiring the stable position that enables you to control your body in the 120mph airflow. Get this right, and you are just about flying, using small movements of arms and legs to turn, slide and swoop. Get it wrong, which I did more than once, and you are a tumbling, spinning ball of limbs and panic, whose parachute lines could be hopelessly tangled if there wasn't an instructor there to sort you out before you pull the ripcord. </p> <p>The second skill is that of safely opening your parachute at the right height, and knowing what to do should it fail to open properly. Not something I ever want to experience, but it's as well to be prepared. </p> <p>The third is being able to fly and land your canopy. Parachutes have come a long way since the silk umbrellas of the second world war. They are more like a foldable glider wing that can be turned, steered and braked. With practice, you can land gently on tip-toes. </p> <p><strong> The course</strong><br> </p> <p> The AFF course consists of a series of lectures and briefings, followed by eight training jumps, first accompanied by two instructors, later by a single instructor and finally alone. All jumps are recorded on video and analysed. There are tasks to complete on each jump, with failure meaning a re-take - and therein lies a trap for the unwary. Although the package price includes all eight levels, re-jumps cost extra and, as you might be paying for two instructors, the costs can quickly mount. I easily racked up an extra \u00a3500 getting it right. </p> <p>Once you have completed all eight AFF levels, you must do 10 solo jumps to earn your \"A\" licence, a sort of basic international driving licence that declares you safe enough to jump with no further supervision. The AFF system is by no means cheap, but is certainly the most cost-effective way of getting qualified fast. </p> <p><strong> The requirements</strong><br> </p> <p> You don't have to be particularly fit, although the British Parachute Association demands a medical certificate for new trainees over 40 years of age. I met people in their 60s and 70s who jump every weekend. The sport is naturally very safety-conscious, and equipment failures are thankfully rare. All parachute rigs come with a reserve canopy in case the main one fails, and a computer chip that will pull the cord for you in the worst-case scenario. </p> <p>By the second half of the week, I was jumping solo - falling through the air for nearly a minute, watching the ground come up at 120mph, and knowing that I had the power in my right hand to save my life. My instructor complimented me on my confident exits from the plane door - little did he realise that if I didn't go quickly I wasn't going at all. I never did stop being scared, but I did learn how to work with the fear and use it. </p> <p><strong> The location</strong><br> </p> <p> Why go all the way to Elsinore to do this, when you could take the same course in the UK? \"The weather,\" says PhD instructor Martin Williams. \"Here we can guarantee you all the jumps you need to qualify in a week. Back home, it could take months, even a year. Also the safety and the facilities, which are second to none.\" </p> <p>Elsinore nestles at the base of the Ortega mountains half way between Los Angeles and San Diego, which gives it a uniquely warm and cloudless microclimate that provides good jumping weather every day of the year. Parachuting has been taking place here for more than 40 years, and some claim this where skydiving was invented. </p> <p>Skydivers flock to Elsinore from all round the world. I met Japanese, Israeli, Canadian, Australian, South African and British pilgrims. At the weekend, Californians turn up in their hordes- whole families, who set up tents and barbecues, bring the kids, music, grub, and skydive all day. I watched around 600 jumps on my first Saturday. </p> <p><strong> Where to stay</strong><br> </p> <p> I stayed at the Casino Motel in Elsinore (+ 909 674 3101), which is pretty much the way it sounds. The focus is the 24-hour casino; rooms are provided so the gamblers don't wander too far away. It's not over-smart, but it provides all the amenities you are likely to need - air conditioning, TV, bath and shower, laundry, food and drink day or night. </p> <p>But the truth is, it hardly mattered where I stayed, because I barely left the drop zone - the first aeroplane ride was at 8.30am and jumping and training lasted until the sudden and dramatic nightfall at around 8.30pm, at which point everyone broke out coolers of beer, and stood around drinking, chatting, laughing, and reviewing the day's activities on video. </p> <p><strong> Where to eat</strong><br> </p> <p> We rarely got away before 9.30pm, by which time just about everything in Elsinore is closed. Most nights, we ate back at the Casino Motel, or at Denny's, both of which provide a typical American menu of plentiful, if mostly fried, food 24 hours a day. </p> <p>If you do manage to get away before 9pm, go downtown for a Mexican meal at Guadalajara (909 674 8924), or an Italian at Vincenzos (909 674 8941). Best of all, go into Temecula, the next town, and enjoy a Thai banquet at the Bangkok Chef, 27451 Jefferson Ave (909 676 0850) - definitely the culinary highlight of my week. </p> <p><strong> Where to drink</strong><br> </p> <p> If you're feeling brave, you could come back to Elsinore for a late-night drink at the Hideway (32392 Mission Trail), a tiny shack of a bar straight out of a \"B\" movie - a line of Harley-Davidsons outside, huge bearded bikers and bikini-clad pole-dancers inside. With the same laid-back friendliness that permeates the whole of southern California, it manages to be seedy and wholesome, threatening and relaxing, at the same time. Not to be missed. </p> <p><strong> Beyond skydiving</strong><br> </p> <p> If you grow bored with skydiving, you could spend a day at the lake - though, frankly, I still think the best view of it is from 12,000ft. Here you can hire Jet Skis (DMP Motor Sports, 909 814 2268), go water skiing (California Skier, 909 674 7900), or wander round the nearby Main Street and view the \"antique\" shops - selling mostly 60s and 70s Americana. While you're there, stop off at Chuckles Java Junction (141 Main Lake St, 909 674 5600), and enjoy one of a selection of 30 or so coffees. They also provide live music and entertainment in the evenings, and Tai-Chi classes on Friday mornings. </p> <p>If you really want to spoil yourself, hire a car (Enterprise Rent-a-car, 158 Campbell Street, 909 245 7997, $38.99 per day for a Saturn, plus discount if you book through the skydiving centre) and treat yourself to a really luxurious day off. Take a trip up the freeway to Glen Ivy, and spend a day at the Hot Spring Spa (1 800 454 8722). Admission to the spa and mud bath costs $29 at weekends, $24 weekdays, and then you can indulge in a whole range of esoteric herbal and massage treatments, right up to the full-day Paradise Package at $300. </p> <p>Mostly, though, I was swept up in the microcosm that was the drop zone. I won't bore you with the friendly rivalries between Formation Skydivers (who do it on their bellies), the young cool Freeflyers (who do it on their heads), and the balletic Freestylers (who do it every which way). Suffice to say that it is an engrossing alternate reality, full of friendly fun-seekers, and very welcoming to the newcomer. </p> <p>I was warned that skydiving could be addictive, but given my level of fear throughout, I was doubtful that I would get hooked. After my 27th jump, my only prayer was \"Thank God, I never have to do that again.\" But a day later, back in the UK, I caught myself thinking: \"I wonder where my nearest drop zone is? Maybe next weekend...\"</p> <p><strong>The practicals </strong></p> <p>An AFF &amp; BPA Cat 8 (\"A\" Licence) package in Lake Elsinore costs \u00a32,300 through <a href=\"http://www.phdskydiving.co.uk\">PhD Skydiving</a> in Wiltshire (01980 621363).

The beach allows us an escape from routine and we can be playful, irresponsible and self-indulgent. </p> <p>However, there are still unwritten rules. To sunbathe in underwear, for instance, is considered uncouth. In many places - Brazil and the US, for instance - you can wear the tiniest bikini, but it would be inappropriate to go topless. And it took an Egyptian friend to point out that European women will sunbathe topless on the beach in full view of people walking along the sea-front but as soon as they step on to the pavement, they feel compelled to put their clothes back on. </p> <p>Leisure is very much a western concept, something that has come with increased wealth, as has the idea of lying in the sun for relaxation. In hot countries, people stay in the shade. Getting a tan is not an issue for dark-skinned people; indeed, being dark is generally considered ugly and denotes the working class, just as it used to in Europe.

      "body": "<p>Naples was a blur. My eyes jogged in their sockets as the airport bus rattled over cobbled streets. It was past 10pm on a warm Mediterranean evening. The caf\u00e9s along Corso Umberto I buzzed with life. Girls in white, figure-hugging trousers straddled mopeds, lit cigarettes and stuck their bosoms out. Macho Neapolitan men stood three-deep at the bar, sunglasses balanced on their foreheads and their T-shirts stretched over taught muscles as they prodded and slapped each other in fun. </p> <p>Off the coast, lightning bolts were crashing to earth on the island of Capri, but the smart set holding court at the caf\u00e9s were not bothered - too busy with their lavish summer-night frivolities before the dawn heralded another day of work. </p> <p>While Naples's citizens got on with the business of making a living, I embarked on the equally serious business of exploring a city as beautiful as it is chaotic. </p> <p>A myriad of visitors have come to Naples over the years and most have left their mark. The Greeks built the original Neapolis, or New City, around 600BC. Later, it was occupied by a succession of Romans, Byzantines, Anjevins and Bourbons until Giuseppe Garibaldi liberated the city in 1860, and Naples became part of a united Italy. </p> <p>Regardless of who was in power, the unstable land beneath Naples periodically shook and exploded as earthquakes and eruptions tore the city apart. Mount Vesuvius rises from the coastal plain to the south-east, a constant reminder that the natural world can strike again at any time. </p> <p>Another destabilising influ ence is the Camorra, the Neapolitan mafia, but most tourists would never know they existed, such is the friendly ambience of this city. It was just my luck that I should inadvertently get caught up in a spot of local police work aimed at curbing their activities. </p> <p>It all happened one blissful evening as I strolled along the Via Partenope gazing at a silhouetted cruise ship on the golden Mediterranean. I'd never had a Campari soda before, and Naples seemed the perfect place to start. So I dived into the Pinterre bar, drank two and waited for David Niven and Sophia Loren to whizz around the corner on a Lambretta en route to a white-suit film function on a yacht. The bitter-sweet taste of the Campari seemed to reflect a city that, for all its history and beauty, has a rough edge. </p> <p>I paid the waiter and left a tip, but I had not gone 100 yards when a plain-clothes policeman grabbed my arm and demanded that I show him my receipt from the bar. When I could not produce it, he urged me in a rather physical manner back to the bar. </p> <p>The manager was duly summoned and emerged from his office straightening his tie and looking worried. The till roll was meticulously inspected to dig out the two payments. The waiter sprang to my defence, waving the tip in the policeman's face and offering the officer some Neopolitan abuse. Then it struck me what was happening. The bar was on trial here, not me. The Campari police were trying to uncover evidence of the Mafia's protection rackets, and anyone getting favours such as a free drink might be a crucial link. Luckily, there was nothing irregular about my bill, and the waiter took great pleasure in escorting the policeman off the premises. </p> <p>Many visitors come to this part of Italy to see Pompeii and the relics of a more hedonistic age but, wonderful as the ruined town is to behold, most of the artefacts seem to be resident in the galleries and museums of Naples these days. The newest addition to the city's display of Pompeiian relics is the fascinating erotic collection in the Museo Archeologico. </p> <p>On the walk back to my hotel, I was reminded of another Neopolitan passion. At a junction on Spaccanapoli, a narrow, pedestrian street that splits the city in two, lay a reclining figure of an Egyptian god. A sky-blue Napoli football scarf had been draped round his neck, and fixed on the wall opposite was a shrine to probably the club's most famous player, Diego Maradona. Two deities vying for the affections of the city. </p> <p>Spurred by that homage to macho men, I strode through Naples' darkening streets, chest puffed and shoulders broad. Only then did I begin to understand the psyche of the muscled Neapolitans in the bars in their T-shirts, and I walked home among the daredevil moped riders without flinching.</p> <p><strong>Neapolitan flavours</strong></p> <p><strong> How to get there</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.go-fly.com\">Go</a> (0845 6054321) \u00a3228 return from Stansted; BA (0345 222111) flies Gatwick to Naples direct from \u00a3230 return; Alitalia (08705 448259) flies Heathrow to Naples via Milan from \u00a3262.40 return.

      "body": "<p>My first family holiday abroad, at the age of six or seven, was spent in Brittany, in a little white hotel beside a beach. And it seemed a very strange place. </p> <p>None of the staff spoke English, and the only other foreigners in the hotel were Enoch Powell and his family. He and my father, who was a Labour MP, nodded to each other rather abruptly on the first day, and thereafter neither family spoke or made any acknowledgement of each other's presence, playing separate games of cricket on different ends of the beach. But I remember Powell's strangulated Midlands vowels drifting across from the other side of the dining room: \"And now children, you will always remember this day for the first time you ever ate... lobster!\" </p> <p>I don't know what the Mallalieu children were eating - or more likely refusing to eat. It was cold, blue, and shiny, possibly some kind of pickled fish or vegetable. It bore no relation to anything we could recognise as food. In those days, olive oil was something most English people put in their ears. </p> <p>The only soft drink at the hotel was a fizzy orange called Pschitt. We would ask the waiters: \"Un orange, s'il vous plait,\" and they would reply: \"Non! Pschitt!\" It was very strange. </p> <p>In the village, a short walk across the fields, the inhabitants spoke Breton, lived in picturesque poverty and earned nothing from tourism. Nearby, probably, there was a small port with decrepit fishing boats. </p> <p>There was nothing to do except play on the beach, which was fine by us. </p> <p>This month, another generation of Mallalieu children went to Brittany, and it was very different. </p> <p>The Pierre et Vacances resort at Port du Crouesty describes itself as \"un village authentique entre mer et port de plaisance,\" but it is reallynothing of the sort. It is a suburb of what has fast become a fair-sized town, and the buildings are in a \"traditional\" Breton style that no one could mistake for the real thing. It is like Poundbury-on-Sea. Twenty years ago, it didn't exist. It has no history, and the entire population changes every fortnight. There are no fishing boats in the harbour, just a thousand or more plastic yachts. All the shops are restaurants, bars, creperies and boutiques. There is no school, no cemetery and no industry other than tourism. </p> <p>It is Club 18-30 in reverse. All the guests are parents in their 30s and 40s with small children and young teenagers. The only people in their late teens and 20s are working here for the summer. Most of the staff speak English and German, but nobody speaks Breton. </p> <p>The car parks are full of sensible family cars: Fords, Peugeots, Citro\u00ebns and Renaults, but not a Mercedes or a beat-up 2CV in sight. </p> <p>The guests are mostly French, with a smaller than usual number of English, German, Dutch and Irish. Years ago, Powell looked unmistakably English, if inauthentic, paddling in the sea with his pinstripe trousers rolled up to his knees. Now in Port du Crouesty, it is impossible to tell anyone's nationality until they speak. We have all become Eurotourists. </p> <p>The food no longer tastes strange. The children are accustomed to olive oil, mussels, garlic, oysters and camembert, if not often to lobster. The restaurant menus offer a homogenised Euro-French cuisine. From what melting pot did the Pizz\u00e9ria Le Nelson emerge? </p> <p>One day, in search of the older Brittany, we went to Carnac to see the stones, but since my last visit the alignments have been fenced off, like Stonehenge, to protect them from tourists. We found a path through the woods to the great menhir, the G\u00e9ant du Manio. There were no fences, and it had been sprayed with graffiti. </p> <p>Port du Crouesty is clearly not the Brittany where Gauguin painted Le Christ Jaune and got into fights with sailors. Nor is it the kind of north French resort where Antoine Roquentin suffered his existential crisis of identity in Jean-Paul Sartre's Nausea. But there has to be a good reason why so many people come here every summer, and there is. </p> <p>Protected from the Atlantic by the Quiberon peninsula, and the islands of Hoedic, Houat and Belle-Ile, the bay is possibly the best place in the whole of Europe for children to learn to sail. </p> <p>Along the rest of the Atlantic coast, the sea is usually too rough. For most of the time in the Mediterranean, there is no wind at all, and then, without warning, you get far too much. The Channel is cold, and the tides and currents often dangerous. But in Quiberon Bay, the sea is flat, sloping safely from the beach, and the wind is light to moderate all day long. </p> <p>In the afternoons, we watched unworried as the children set off into the distance in kayaks and catamarans. Then we could stroll off, unconcerned, 40 minutes south-west to an almost deserted beach, where there were no fake- Breton houses, only sand dunes, marram grass, brambles and wild fennel. </p> <p><strong> How clean are the beaches?</strong><br> </p> <p> Compared with what it must have looked like only nine months ago after the spill, the change is miraculous. There were few traces of oil, less than you would find on most English beaches - and far less rubbish - but you don't see many seabirds, and the first oyster I ate tasted of soap. It might have been the detergent used to clean up the oil, or I might have been imagining it. My younger daughter developed a rash after swimming in the sea and digging in the sand. It could have been an allergic reaction to the detergent. More likely, it was a jellyfish sting. </p> <p><strong> Where to stay</strong><br> </p> <p> Eurovillages (01606 787776) offers 6/7-person Pierre et Vacances sea-facing apart ments with a terrace from \u00a3376-\u00a31,090 per week including a Channel crossing with Brittany Ferries for a car and five passengers. A 6/7-person apartment is comfortable for four, just about adequate for five but would be seriously cramped with seven. You cannot check in before 5pm and, after an all-night crossing and 200 miles on the wrong side of the road, this is not good news. </p> <p><strong> What to take</strong><br> </p> <p> Comfortable pillows, an English tin opener (the mysteries of French tin openers take far longer than a week to master), a large pan, coffee mugs (only espresso cups provided), wine glasses (surprisingly there were none in the apartment). </p> <p><strong> What to do</strong><br> </p> <p> Clubs for 3-12 year olds cost \u00a349 for the first six half-day sessions, \u00a314 for the next six. Clubs for 13-18 year olds cost \u00a349 for the week. The creche costs \u00a327 for 10 hours. The clubs are a mixed programme of sailing, archery, volleyball, fencing, sandball, crab fishing and games, although the organisers are also alarmingly keen to put in shows with elaborate dance routines to French pop songs. </p> <p>Dedicated sailing courses for seven year olds upwards cost from \u00a365 to \u00a3120 for five 2-3-hour sessions. </p> <p>You can hire bikes by the day or week, the local tennis courts cost \u00a37 per hour, and there is an 18-hole golf course nearby at St Gildas de Rhuys (0033 2 9745 3090). </p> <p>Thalassa (+2 9753 7025) and Navix (+2 9746 6000) run ferries to the islands and boat trips round the Gulf of Morbihan.

Marooned in its absurdly small lake, it looks like an ocean liner designed by Le Corbusier. Inside, women with sharply-toned bodies and hairy middle- aged men wander about in starched white dressing gowns, destressed to the point of catatonia.

      "bodyText": "My first family holiday abroad, at the age of six or seven, was spent in Brittany, in a little white hotel beside a beach. And it seemed a very strange place. None of the staff spoke English, and the only other foreigners in the hotel were Enoch Powell and his family. He and my father, who was a Labour MP, nodded to each other rather abruptly on the first day, and thereafter neither family spoke or made any acknowledgement of each other's presence, playing separate games of cricket on different ends of the beach. But I remember Powell's strangulated Midlands vowels drifting across from the other side of the dining room: \"And now children, you will always remember this day for the first time you ever ate... lobster!\" I don't know what the Mallalieu children were eating - or more likely refusing to eat. It was cold, blue, and shiny, possibly some kind of pickled fish or vegetable. It bore no relation to anything we could recognise as food. In those days, olive oil was something most English people put in their ears. The only soft drink at the hotel was a fizzy orange called Pschitt. We would ask the waiters: \"Un orange, s'il vous plait,\" and they would reply: \"Non! Pschitt!\" It was very strange. In the village, a short walk across the fields, the inhabitants spoke Breton, lived in picturesque poverty and earned nothing from tourism. Nearby, probably, there was a small port with decrepit fishing boats. There was nothing to do except play on the beach, which was fine by us. This month, another generation of Mallalieu children went to Brittany, and it was very different. The Pierre et Vacances resort at Port du Crouesty describes itself as \"un village authentique entre mer et port de plaisance,\" but it is reallynothing of the sort. It is a suburb of what has fast become a fair-sized town, and the buildings are in a \"traditional\" Breton style that no one could mistake for the real thing. It is like Poundbury-on-Sea. Twenty years ago, it didn't exist. It has no history, and the entire population changes every fortnight. There are no fishing boats in the harbour, just a thousand or more plastic yachts.

      "body": "<p>Spain is rightly proud of her paradors, 86 state-run hotels that have helped preserve and renovate some of her most historic buildings. \"Quality, charm, history\" is their motto, though only 37 are truly authentic and some entirely bogus. They can tend to a sameness of style, and piped music over your chorizo and boiled eggs sometimes smacks of the Harvester-en-Hispania. But they offer a touch of old Spain and, perched often in castles soaring above the olive groves, an affordable taste of the high life. </p> <p>Imaginative Amigos de Paradores tarjetas - five-day credit cards allowing you to stay for \u00a348 a double - can make paradors fantastic value. So armed, you can hire a car and hop from one to another. There's no better start than heading south for Andalucia, a region which - like nowhere else in Spain - blends modernity with a passion for traditional hospitality, and the drama of an unforgettable landscape and history. </p> <p><strong> Ronda</strong><br> </p> <p> Ronda's parador is next to the medieval \"New Bridge\", edging the thundering chasm. Built inside the Town Hall, its glass entrance is thoroughly modern-chic, and the hotel stylish and efficient. For history, set off around town or visit Ronda's bull ring, Spain's oldest and most elegant. Looking out over the parador's tiny swimming pool, down to the river Tajo, the historical juices really start flowing. </p> <p>Ronda is a dash from the sea and a favourite of the Brits, but dusk in Plaza de Socorro brings out the parade of local life and Ronda becomes far more than a tourist museum. </p> <p> <strong> Address:</strong> Plaza de Espa\u00f1a.<br> <strong> Telephone:</strong> 00 34 952 87 75 00. <br><strong> E-mail:</strong> <a href=\"mailto:ronda@parador.es\">ronda@parador.es</a> <br><strong> Extras: </strong> The parador offers mountain bikes free of charge. You can buy a useful booklet to the region in the tourist office next to the parador. Ronda's bull ring opens at 10am till 8pm and entrance is Ptas500.<br><strong> Next bull fight:</strong> September 9. </p> <p> <strong> Arcos de la Frontera</strong><br> </p> <p> The parador is in the Corregidor's Palace, flanking the main square, a delight of cobbles, ancient walls and orange trees, spoilt only by the cars. </p> <p>With hacienda-style bedrooms and vaulted orange corridors kitted out simply with oak chests and pottery, this is a nice example of a grand Andalucian house, with its familiar central atrium. </p> <p>But the iron balconies and tatty sun terrace make Arcos something of a dowdy maiden aunt compared with Ronda. We couldn't get a beer after 11.30pm either, while pleas to breakfast on the terrace met with Andalucian defiance. It hardly mattered. Arcos has a sleepy charm all its own and, from room 18's terrace, the view across the white-washed houses to the 15th-century San Pedro is unforgettable. </p> <p>Paradors all offer imaginitive choices of regional food, though the quality tends to be stolid. Some of the riojas are superb value, especially a Cune 1996, and the breakfasts always expansive. </p> <p>The suffix \"de la Frontera\" stretches back to the Christian reconquest, pressing at the gates of Moorish Al Andalus.

      "bodyText": "Spain is rightly proud of her paradors, 86 state-run hotels that have helped preserve and renovate some of her most historic buildings. \"Quality, charm, history\" is their motto, though only 37 are truly authentic and some entirely bogus. They can tend to a sameness of style, and piped music over your chorizo and boiled eggs sometimes smacks of the Harvester-en-Hispania. But they offer a touch of old Spain and, perched often in castles soaring above the olive groves, an affordable taste of the high life. Imaginative Amigos de Paradores tarjetas - five-day credit cards allowing you to stay for \u00a348 a double - can make paradors fantastic value. So armed, you can hire a car and hop from one to another. There's no better start than heading south for Andalucia, a region which - like nowhere else in Spain - blends modernity with a passion for traditional hospitality, and the drama of an unforgettable landscape and history. Ronda Ronda's parador is next to the medieval \"New Bridge\", edging the thundering chasm. Built inside the Town Hall, its glass entrance is thoroughly modern-chic, and the hotel stylish and efficient. For history, set off around town or visit Ronda's bull ring, Spain's oldest and most elegant. Looking out over the parador's tiny swimming pool, down to the river Tajo, the historical juices really start flowing. Ronda is a dash from the sea and a favourite of the Brits, but dusk in Plaza de Socorro brings out the parade of local life and Ronda becomes far more than a tourist museum. Address: Plaza de Espa\u00f1a. Telephone: 00 34 952 87 75 00. E-mail: ronda@parador.es Extras: The parador offers mountain bikes free of charge. You can buy a useful booklet to the region in the tourist office next to the parador. Ronda's bull ring opens at 10am till 8pm and entrance is Ptas500. Next bull fight: September 9. Arcos de la Frontera The parador is in the Corregidor's Palace, flanking the main square, a delight of cobbles, ancient walls and orange trees, spoilt only by the cars. With hacienda-style bedrooms and vaulted orange corridors kitted out simply with oak chests and pottery, this is a nice example of a grand Andalucian house, with its familiar central atrium. But the iron balconies and tatty sun terrace make Arcos something of a dowdy maiden aunt compared with Ronda. We couldn't get a beer after 11.30pm either, while pleas to breakfast on the terrace met with Andalucian defiance. It hardly mattered. Arcos has a sleepy charm all its own and, from room 18's terrace, the view across the white-washed houses to the 15th-century San Pedro is unforgettable. Paradors all offer imaginitive choices of regional food, though the quality tends to be stolid. Some of the riojas are superb value, especially a Cune 1996, and the breakfasts always expansive. The suffix \"de la Frontera\" stretches back to the Christian reconquest, pressing at the gates of Moorish Al Andalus. Arcos is a perfect launch pad either for the White Towns - like windy La Zahara rising like a medieval Titanic above its glittering turquoise reservoir - or the undervalued south-west. Jerez de la Frontera - home of sherry, the Spanish Riding School and Flamenco - is 40 minutes away and beyond is the Cota Do\u00f1ana National Park, edging the estuary of the Qualquiver river. Also here is the Costa De La Luz, which has largely been protected from the building that has wrecked the Costa Del Crime. Address: Plaza del Cabildo. Telephone: 00 34 956 70 05 00.

That skin, pockmarked, bristled, bulging, peeled back to reveal teeth like a mule's, is drawn with a delirious precision. It is an iconic ugliness. But this is not only the face Crumb sees in the mirror. It is also the face the media reflect back to him as a celebrity, a walking caricature. His fame - unusually for a cartoonist, he can sell a comic by putting his own face on the cover - is something he depicts as self-alienation. If simply seeing his face in the mirror appals him, how can he bear to be the public figure that is Robert Crumb? </p> <p>This comic appeared on the eve of the release of Terry Zwigoff's Crumb, perhaps the most uninhibited portrayal of a living artist on film. It revealed Crumb as one of three eccentric brothers who grew up together in an isolated, secret world of cartooning and sexual waywardness. In Self-Loathing Comics, Crumb gives his version of his life. He and his wife, the cartoonist Aline Kominsky-Crumb, drawing from opposite ends of the book, depict their new life in a village in France. This is a life that should be happy, and indeed apparently is - except for Crumb's raging fantasies and self-disgust. </p> <p>In the mirror in this picture, Crumb does not see a man he sees a cartoon character, a monster. This is a troubling application of the art of drawing. The obsessive accuracy of his art makes it the cruellest of mirrors. Crumb sees himself suddenly as nothing but a physical object. He is appalled not just by having his face but any face. </p> <p>Inspirations and influences: Crumb's influence can be seen in a whole school of Californian artists who wallow in the grotesque. Paul McCarthy and Mike Kelley's video Heidi (1992), a perverted version of the children's story, does something similar to Crumb's mutation of the infantile territory of comics. Jim Shaw's autobiographical Dream Drawings inhabit the same twisted world. </p> <p><strong>Where is it?</strong> In Carnivalesque, an exhibition at the Castle Museum and Art Gallery and Djanogly Art Galleries, Nottingham (0115-951 3192), till September 10.</p>",

It revealed Crumb as one of three eccentric brothers who grew up together in an isolated, secret world of cartooning and sexual waywardness. In Self-Loathing Comics, Crumb gives his version of his life. He and his wife, the cartoonist Aline Kominsky-Crumb, drawing from opposite ends of the book, depict their new life in a village in France. This is a life that should be happy, and indeed apparently is - except for Crumb's raging fantasies and self-disgust. In the mirror in this picture, Crumb does not see a man he sees a cartoon character, a monster. This is a troubling application of the art of drawing. The obsessive accuracy of his art makes it the cruellest of mirrors. Crumb sees himself suddenly as nothing but a physical object. He is appalled not just by having his face but any face. Inspirations and influences: Crumb's influence can be seen in a whole school of Californian artists who wallow in the grotesque. Paul McCarthy and Mike Kelley's video Heidi (1992), a perverted version of the children's story, does something similar to Crumb's mutation of the infantile territory of comics. Jim Shaw's autobiographical Dream Drawings inhabit the same twisted world. Where is it? In Carnivalesque, an exhibition at the Castle Museum and Art Gallery and Djanogly Art Galleries, Nottingham (0115-951 3192), till September 10.",

The shooting at the cafe - which had been firebombed twice - has fuelled a growing fear for the community's survival and the belief, among some, that there is a concerted campaign to drive them from the city.</p> <p>\"The Asians have everything,\" said one of the young black men smoking on the steps outside the Young Lion. He will not give his name, but says he was injured in the mass attack on July 14. \"White and black folks, we're doing all right, but the Asians get everything handed down to them.

      "body": "<p>Online shopping saves you money. That's the message e-tailers are bleating non-stop to woo you away from the high street and grab your hard-earned cash. But with the deluge of companies that now sell online, how do you know you've really got a bargain? Can you be sure there isn't an even better deal around the e-corner? And how would you find that cheaper site anyway? </p> <p>Yannis Bakos, professor of management at New York University, has studied online retailing. \"The more difficult it is for consumers to search for cheaper prices, the more sellers can charge for their goods,\" he says. </p> <p> In a nutshell, this is the foundation for monopolising the market, and that's what sites like DealTime, Shopper and ShopSmart aim to stop. These sites don't actually sell anything, instead they scour the net for deals on the things you want to buy. Type in the name of an item on DealTime, for example, and the site offers up a table of results showing the price of the product, shipping costs, a link to the e-tailer's site and - when possible - gives a trustworthiness score based on one of the online trading accreditation schemes. </p> <p>At present, most comparison shopping sites are geared towards gadgetry and computer equipment, CDs, DVDs, books and videogames. The size of the bargains vary, depending on the product, but getting away from big names is sure to help. According to recent research, though Amazon's prices are by no means the cheapest in the market, the company still commands 80% of online book sales worldwide (see table below for sample price comparisons). </p> <p>One drawback of these large price comparison sites is that many only include a select group of online retailers. These are picked for their quality of service and reliability - which is a good thing in itself. But this fact does mean that you could be missing out on a much cheaper deal on some small site elsewhere, which quite possibly represents a company just down the road. </p> <p>Here intelligent comparison shopping agents come in handy. RUSure is one such helper. First you have to download the program to your computer. The software then pops up a window on your screen that sits there monitoring your surfing. If the program detects that you are visting an online retailer it scurries off in the background hunting for another shop that offers the product you're looking at for cheaper and reports back, prompting you with the lower price it's found. </p> <p>Automatic agents, like RUSure, do have drawbacks. For one thing, you may not like to be watched by the software. The company will collect detailed information on all your surfing actvities, including the banner ads you click on, the sites you visit and where you shop. If you submit personal details, RUSure will match the profile to your name and identify this information with your computer. It may also share this information with third parties. </p> <p>Comparing prices isn't the only way to get a bargain. The old idea of bulk buying, now re-branded as \"co-buying\", is resurfacing in many websites. The principle is: if a group of people get together to buy a large quantity of products direct from the manufacturer, cutting out the chain of middle-men, then the price to each individual is likely to be much lower. </p> <p>Letsbuyit has been running co-buying schemes for over a year and has attracted 800,000 members to its online shoppers community. It has grabbed top buyers from many traditional high street retailers and is striking deals with manufacturers to provide goods at savings of up to 60% in comparison with high street prices. At the time of writing, a wide screen TV was on sale for \u00a3799 on the site, compared with a high street price of around \u00a31,200. </p> <p>Letsbuyit sets up a co-buy by negotiating a low price for an item with the manufacturer. It then advertises the co-buy on its website with a time limit and a quota of units for sale. As more people sign up to buy the item, the price falls until the whole quota is sold and the lowest price possible is reached. If the time limit expires before all the units are sold the customers pay a slightly higher price. </p> <p>An example of the bizarre power of co-buying is Letsbuyit's deal with Amerada Gas. The domestic gas suppliers will sell you gas marginally cheaper if you sign up through Letsbuyit. </p> <p>Co-buying has been adopted by MyTaxi too, a shopping site that aims to cater for all your online shopping needs. MyTaxi also offers price comparison tools, and lets you build your own shopping portal with links to your favourite online retailers. </p> <p>But perhaps the pi\u00e8ce de resistance of online shopping is the mighty Priceline, which lets you name your own price for the goods it sells. Priceline is huge in the US, with 7m customers to date. </p> <p>The idea is simple: you name a price for a ticket, hotel room, or other item you want to buy, and Priceline goes off and tries to find a company that will sell it to you for that price (factoring in a small commission for Priceline). If no one matches the price, Priceline will buy the product for you, providing your price is reasonable, and honour your price. On average, customers in the US save 54% on airline tickets. </p> <p>There are some checks and balances so that priceline doesn't end up selling flights to Hawai for nothing. Priceline says airline companies will sell tickets at up to 30% below the lowest price they have ever sold the ticket, 50% of the time. It will match the prices accordingly. Priceline will be available to Europeans this autumn. </p> <p>\"These are all great opportunities for the consumer,\" says Richard Webb of the Trading Standards Institute, \"but we would just encourage people not to act on impulse or rely solely on what the web sites offer. It's important to shop around.\" </p> <p>And remember, one drawback of online bargain hunting is that you usually have to wait days, or even weeks, for your cut-price find to arrive. Perhaps it's unwise to give up on the high street sales just yet. </p> <p> <strong> Online details</strong> </p> <p> <a href=\"http://www.shopsmart.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.shopsmart.com</a> </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.letsbuyit.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.letsbuyit.com</a> </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.rusure.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.rusure.com</a> </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.dealtime.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.dealtime.com</a> </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.mytaxi.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.mytaxi.com</a> </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.shoptour.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.shoptour.co.uk</a> </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.shopgenie.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.shopgenie.com</a> </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.priceline.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.priceline.com</a> </p> <p><a href=\"www.clickthebutton.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.clickthebutton.com</a></p> <p><strong>What they charge</strong><br> Prices for: Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire by JK Rowling, Comparison shop performed on ShopSmart (include s delivery): </p> <p> The Good Book Guide \u00a39.44 <br>WHSmith \u00a39.75 <br>Ottakar's \u00a39.95 <br>Waterstones \u00a39.95 <br>Gillihams \u00a310.24 <br>Amazon.co.uk \u00a311.74 <br>CountryBookShop \u00a312.94 <br>StudentBookWorld \u00a313.69 <br>SpaceStore \u00a314.24</p>",

These are picked for their quality of service and reliability - which is a good thing in itself. But this fact does mean that you could be missing out on a much cheaper deal on some small site elsewhere, which quite possibly represents a company just down the road. Here intelligent comparison shopping agents come in handy. RUSure is one such helper. First you have to download the program to your computer. The software then pops up a window on your screen that sits there monitoring your surfing. If the program detects that you are visting an online retailer it scurries off in the background hunting for another shop that offers the product you're looking at for cheaper and reports back, prompting you with the lower price it's found. Automatic agents, like RUSure, do have drawbacks. For one thing, you may not like to be watched by the software. The company will collect detailed information on all your surfing actvities, including the banner ads you click on, the sites you visit and where you shop. If you submit personal details, RUSure will match the profile to your name and identify this information with your computer. It may also share this information with third parties. Comparing prices isn't the only way to get a bargain. The old idea of bulk buying, now re-branded as \"co-buying\", is resurfacing in many websites. The principle is: if a group of people get together to buy a large quantity of products direct from the manufacturer, cutting out the chain of middle-men, then the price to each individual is likely to be much lower. Letsbuyit has been running co-buying schemes for over a year and has attracted 800,000 members to its online shoppers community. It has grabbed top buyers from many traditional high street retailers and is striking deals with manufacturers to provide goods at savings of up to 60% in comparison with high street prices. At the time of writing, a wide screen TV was on sale for \u00a3799 on the site, compared with a high street price of around \u00a31,200. Letsbuyit sets up a co-buy by negotiating a low price for an item with the manufacturer. It then advertises the co-buy on its website with a time limit and a quota of units for sale. As more people sign up to buy the item, the price falls until the whole quota is sold and the lowest price possible is reached. If the time limit expires before all the units are sold the customers pay a slightly higher price. An example of the bizarre power of co-buying is Letsbuyit's deal with Amerada Gas. The domestic gas suppliers will sell you gas marginally cheaper if you sign up through Letsbuyit. Co-buying has been adopted by MyTaxi too, a shopping site that aims to cater for all your online shopping needs. MyTaxi also offers price comparison tools, and lets you build your own shopping portal with links to your favourite online retailers. But perhaps the pi\u00e8ce de resistance of online shopping is the mighty Priceline, which lets you name your own price for the goods it sells. Priceline is huge in the US, with 7m customers to date. The idea is simple: you name a price for a ticket, hotel room, or other item you want to buy, and Priceline goes off and tries to find a company that will sell it to you for that price (factoring in a small commission for Priceline). If no one matches the price, Priceline will buy the product for you, providing your price is reasonable, and honour your price. On average, customers in the US save 54% on airline tickets. There are some checks and balances so that priceline doesn't end up selling flights to Hawai for nothing. Priceline says airline companies will sell tickets at up to 30% below the lowest price they have ever sold the ticket, 50% of the time. It will match the prices accordingly. Priceline will be available to Europeans this autumn. \"These are all great opportunities for the consumer,\" says Richard Webb of the Trading Standards Institute, \"but we would just encourage people not to act on impulse or rely solely on what the web sites offer. It's important to shop around.\" And remember, one drawback of online bargain hunting is that you usually have to wait days, or even weeks, for your cut-price find to arrive. Perhaps it's unwise to give up on the high street sales just yet.

That's because he has now made 3,500 films, many without having to re-feed the cameraman's parking meter. The oriental, martial-arts version of G*rard Depardieu or Gene Hackman or the sorely missed Klaus Kinski, Chan makes movies faster than most people can make change, which is astonishing considering the number of bones he has broken during his career. In the time it will have taken to write this review, Chan will have made another three movies: Enter The Kimono Dragon, Rumble In Little Formosa and Last Tango In Hunan. Jackie Chan is more than a movie star. He is an entire industrial sector.</p> <p>One of the things that makes Jackie Chan movies so appealing is their fabulously cheesy quality. Shot on shoe-string budgets in out-of-the-way locales with no stars and wafer-thin plots, films like What's My Name? are basically just an excuse for Chan to clamber up and down the facades of tall office buildings and ride motorcycles atop speeding locomotives. The basic plot-line is set up immediately, and then the stunts begin; niceties like subplots, character development or actual acting are dismissed out of hand. </p> <p>Although the films are filled with fight sequences, the combat tends to be of a decidedly cartoonish variety, with little blood and few mutilations. This makes the films suitable for viewing by all age groups and genders, though Chan's biggest fans are young men, just as Meg Ryan's biggest fans are not. </p> <p>Primitive yet clever, the average Jackie Chan movie is the celluloid equivalent to the average pop song: dumb but entertaining. They are what they are.</p> <p>Shanghai Noon is not, however, the average Jackie Chan movie. Determined to reach a much wider audience, to bring an actor who is still basically a cult figure to the masses, Hollywood has now produced the first high-concept Jackie Chan movie. (Rush Hour, released two years ago, was a step in this direction, but it was still basically a slap-dash affair.) The results are immediately apparent. In Shanghai Noon the camerawork is better than in previous Jackie Chan movies. The locations are more seductive. The plot is more complex. A co-star with an actual role shares the screen with Chan. The minor characters have not been dubbed into English, but actually speak it. In every way imaginable, the film has a much more polished look than the usual Jackie Chan fare, radiating a visual and thematic professionalism that is rarely part of the Chan oeuvre. Personally, I still prefer crummy-looking movies like Twin Dragons and Who Am I? But if loftier production values will make Chan a bigger star, then I'm all for it. This guy deserves whatever he can get.</p> <p>Stripped to the core, Shanghai Noon is a fusion of the traditional buddy film with the traditional fish-out-of-water film, superimposed on the traditional western settling-of-accounts film. Early in the proceedings, the daughter of the Chinese emperor is abducted by a scoundrel masquerading as her tutor. After she is carried off to the Old West and held for an enormous ransom, three Imperial guards are dispatched to retrieve her. At the last minute, Chan, who plays a somewhat inept Imperial guard, also joins the group. Since Chan was on duty the night the princess was abducted, and might have prevented her kidnap, he has a personal stake in the matter. He also has a crush on the princess, played with appropriate mystery by Ally McBeal's Lucy Liu, who will soon light up the screen in Charlie's Angels.</p> <p>The Chinese warriors soon arrive in the Old West, make a complete hash of things, realise that they are out of their element and drop out of the film until its exciting conclusion. But the diligent, smitten Chan soldiers on, running through his usual gamut of amazing stunts, performing a sort of Greatest Hits medley for people who have never seen him in action before.</p> <p>In due course, Chan hooks up with Owen Wilson, a downwardly mobile gunslinger and bank robber of vaguely philosophical bent. Seeking to unlock the inner hombre that he believes resides inside himself somewhere, Wilson imbues the film with a charming New Age fatuousness that would have been even funnier if the scriptwriter had written better, and more, jokes. In the meantime, Chan continues to run through his repertoire, performing hilarious, mind-boggling routines with savage Indians, racist cowboys, unscrupulous sheriffs, determined vigilantes, uncooperative horses. </p> <p>Where the average Jackie Chan movie lasts 90 minutes or less, Shanghai Noon drags on for almost two hours, which is exactly 30 minutes too long. Director Tom Day seems to have wanted to make a horse opera spoof on the order of Mel Brooks' peerless Blazing Saddles, but he doesn't have enough material to work with. Moreover, he seems to have persuaded himself that Owen Wilson is much funnier than he is. Wilson is OK. But he's not going to make anyone forget Gene Wilder. Unless they already have forgotten Gene Wilder.</p> <p>The one thing Shanghai Noon lacks is the manic quality of many earlier Jackie Chan movies; the momentum is constantly slowed down by Wilson's amusing but extraneous antics. It is as if the producers of Shanghai Noon didn't trust Chan to carry the ball all by himself.

Two courses at lunch cost \u00a319.50, three cost \u00a326.50, but considering the labour, love, originality and Epicurean pleasure involved in each mouthful, it isn't unreasonable. You will pay more and have less fun in most places in London. Or the Orient, come to that.",

Well, this is a knapweed of quality (I'm not sure that I've hit the right note yet). Unlike the brighter yellow, larger-flowered C. macrocephala, it is not at all a coarse plant, and has pale-yellow thistle-heads opening from a near spherical bud in which the overlapping bracts are carefully dappled in dark and lighter brown.

There being far more to gardening than just grow-ing a plant well, I intend in front of mine to make quite a large colony of a tall border phlox called 'Princess Sturdza' (2m), which is deep mauve and not unlike the species Phlox paniculata itself, but stiffer and more upright. With so much cloud cover this summer, it has been a great year for phloxes, and colour in general has been more intense than under blazing sunshine. </p> <p>Even though it may qualify for the \"quietly pleasing\" category, I want also to recommend a tree mallow with a difference: Lavatera cachemiriana (2m). Its flowers are a quite soft version of the usual mallow pink, but the five petals are widely separated and each is deeply notched, which gives the whole plant a distinctive appearance, as do its pale-green developing seed pods. Prune it quite hard in the dormant season, as you would with all tree mallows, so this associates well with herbaceous perennials in a mixed border; a purple Clematis 'Jackmanii', say, behind it looks good. The mallow can be raised from Thompson &amp; Morgan seed. </p> <p>Also from seed, you should grow the pure-white version of perennial pea, Lathyrus latifolius, which may be listed as 'Albus' or as 'White Pearl'. Don't be too surprised if some of the seedlings come in one of the many shades of pink or magenta that this species also embraces. The white kind is the cleanest, and the pea flowers are borne in short, one-sided racemes. </p> <p>In a mixed border, they will materialise unexpectedly when you have forgotten about them and will then clamber gracefully over their neighbours. One of the yellow-flowered clematis, such as 'Helios', will make a good companion. </p> <p>Many perennial sunflowers are currently on trial at Wisley. Cultivars of heliopsis are a particularly rich shade of yellow, and the one that has struck me most forcibly is called 'Benzinggold' (1.5m), which carries upright daisies with several layers of petals. Slug damage can ruin young plants from the start, and it is a genus that doesn't respond well to undue competition from neighbours, so try to give them an open, sunny site. That said, I would recommend growing, fairly nearby, Salvia guaranitica 'Blue Enigma' (2m), which is an intense deep blue and has a long flowering season. Most people's concept of impatiens is the dwarf busy lizzie, widely grown for bedding and in a range of contrasting colours. In which case, I. tinctoria (2m) will come as a surprise: not only is this plant tall and lush, but its large, butterfly- like flowers are presented as individuals (albeit in an inflorescence). They are white with a conspicuous central purple blotch, and are powerfully night-scented. The plant has tubers, and mine overwintered so well in the garden that it has been flowering already for a long while and will continue until the first frost.

The government of the British territory yesterday joined an escalating campaign among increasingly angry Gibraltarians demanding access to secret MoD reports on the safety implications of the plan to fix the submarine's nuclear reactor cooling system. The Gibraltar government says it was initially given the impression by the MoD that there was \"no risk at all\" involved in repairing HMS Tireless in the harbour of the Rock. Sir John Cadogan, chairman of the defence nuclear safety committee and professor of chemistry at London University, has now said the risk is \"modest\", according to sources close to the Gibraltar government. He is reported to have told the government that there would be no greater risk than repairing the submarine in a British dockyard, such as Devonport, specially equipped to deal with damaged nuclear submarines. However, this view was challenged yesterday by a source familiar with the problems confronting the Tireless. He described the risk of repairing the submarine on the Rock as \"high\". He said the fault was located above valves controlling pressure to the submarine's generators close to the reactor itself. Leaking water was close to the reactor's fuel, he added. This, according to other sources, is why the MoD abandoned plans to tow the submarine back to Devonport where the fuel would have been drained from the reactor. The proximity of the leaking water and the fuel carries the risk of spillage from the submarine in the event of any abrupt movement, sources who did not want to be identified told the Guardian. Peter Caruana, chief minister, said: \"What is concerning Gibraltar, which has a long and close relationship with the MoD, is that while we are used to receiving visits from nuclear submarines, and we are relaxed about that, there is no experience in Gibraltar of repairs to broken down nuclear submarines being undertaken here. \"The position that the government have adopted and have maintained is that repairs should only be carried out in Gibraltar if there is no risk to public health from the carrying out of repairs,\" he told BBC radio. Mr Caruana said his government wanted the MoD to hand over its safety case so that a panel of independent experts could assess Gibraltar's suitability as a place for the repairs to be done. He added: \"The MoD have declined to make that information available to the Government, the Government is therefore unable to say whether the repairs are safe or not. \"I think the MoD needs to think long and hard about whether it proceeds with the repairs in Gibraltar unless the government and people of Gibraltar can be satisfied.\" Lawyers acting for groups representing a broad cross-section of the Gibraltarian community, including the local branch of the Transport and General Workers' Union, sent a letter to the MoD demanding access to its official safety assessment.

What was it that persuaded him to leave his handsome home in Barcelona, where he has lived and prospered in business since retiring as a player, to risk all in Lanarkshire? Is he a diehard Airdrie fan? </p> <p> 'A bsolutely not,\" he says. \"I deliberately chose a club I had no association with. If you buy something you love, you lose all perspective.

The revised terms of the deal will see QXL give 34 of its shares for each Ricardo share, as opposed to the previously agreed 42.6 shares. Last week QXL said that the deal was being re-examined after new information about Ricardo had come into its possession. </p> <p>The renegotiation of the merger has cost Ricardo chairman Eckhard Pfeiffer his place on the enlarged board. </p> <p>QXL said that the former Compaq chief executive and director of General Motors would be replaced by another Ricardo director.</p>",

Shares in QXL rose to 63p in early trading amid initial relief that the deal would go ahead, but ended the session down 0.5p at 59.75p. Shares in both companies have fallen by some two-thirds since the deal was first announced in May. Analysts say the merged group will have a lot to prove, not least improving revenues and better gross auction value at Ricardo, which the company warned would be 20% lower in the fourth quarter than it was in the third. \"OK, the price is far lower than previously announced, but with already small revenues down 20% you have to ask what exactly QXL are buying,\" said one analyst. QXL insisted that the fall in revenues was temporary, and that Ricardo presented good growth prospects in one of Europe's most important markets. The revised terms of the deal will see QXL give 34 of its shares for each Ricardo share, as opposed to the previously agreed 42.6 shares. Last week QXL said that the deal was being re-examined after new information about Ricardo had come into its possession. The renegotiation of the merger has cost Ricardo chairman Eckhard Pfeiffer his place on the enlarged board. QXL said that the former Compaq chief executive and director of General Motors would be replaced by another Ricardo director.",

More than 20 years after the definition of \"brain death\" was established in Britain, enabling heart transplants to take place, a controversy that has been simmering in operating theatres round the country has broken into the public arena. The issue of whether pain might be experienced by a patient certified brainstem dead whose heart is still beating during surgery to remove donated organs, has long been controversial among anaesthetists, but feelings have become inflamed since the publication of guidelines from the Intensive Care Society last year stating that analgesia is not necessary. An editorial in Anaesthesia, the journal of the Royal College of Anaesthetists, has now called for an anaesthetic to be given routinely during operations to remove the heart, lung, liver and pancreas - all of which take place while the patient is on a ventilator. Although they have been reluctant to speak publicly for fear of damaging the transplantation programme, which is desperately short of life-saving donated organs, many anaesthetists confess to lingering doubts as to what might still be happening in the brain of the donor, even though his or her brainstem shows no response to tests and there is no question of survival - even on a life-support machine - for more than a few days. \"Almost everyone will say they have felt uneasy about it,\" said Philip Keep, a consultant anaesthetist at the Norfolk and Norwich hospital. \"Nurses get really, really upset.

      "bodyText": "Indonesia's disgraced army could be granted an amnesty for human rights abuses in East Timor after a last-minute amendment to the country's constitution. The amendment appeared to contradict President Abdurrahman Wahid's assurances to the UN that Indonesia would conduct its own investigation into massacres in East Timor, and that an international war crimes tribunal was not necessary. The controversial change was introduced on the final afternoon of the annual session of the country's supreme legislative body, the people's consultative assembly (MPR). Some legislators tried to reassure critics that it would exclude major human rights abuses. The MPR also voted unanimously to allow the military to retain its formal role in government for a further five years after the next election, taking it to 2009. Analysts said the moves indicated a reluctance to offend the armed forces, which are still powerful. There has been speculation that the army might stage a coup if it were forced from the political scene. Indonesia's constitution will now say that military personnel cannot be prosecuted for crimes committed before the enactment of the legislation used to prosecute them. A decree to enable Indonesia to investigate the atrocities was cancelled in February, even though a law aimed at creating a special court to deal with past human rights violations by the security forces had yet to be enacted. The constitutional amendment could affect the investigation of military abuses all over the archipelago, from Aceh to West Papua, but will have most immediate relevance to events in East Timor. Hundreds of East Timorese were murdered by Indonesia's military-backed militias before and after the territory voted for independence last year, and hundreds of thousands more were forcibly evacuated to neighbouring West Timor. Soldiers and militiamen destroyed tens of thousands of buildings. Political analyst Kusnanto Anggoro said of the amendment: \"This shows that the military is still a powerful force to be reckoned with.\" But a senior MPR legislator, Jacob Tobing, indicated that it might still be possible to prosecute the dozen generals allegedly responsible for the East Timor abuses. He said that the amendment would probably not apply to \"special crimes\" such as genocide, war crimes and terrorism. One western diplomat said: \"It is all very vague. What is more worrying is that the investigation is proceeding without any formal legal basis so the defence lawyers will be able to announce a very strong case to have any charges thrown out.\" In East Timor, the vast majority of people say those responsible must be tried. What's more, they say the trials should take place in an international tribunal because they do not have confidence in Indonesia's notoriously corrupt legal system. \"The location of the tribunal is not important as long as it's not in Indonesia or under Indonesian law,\" said Aniceto Lopes of the East Timor Human Rights Foundation. A UN spokeswoman said yesterday that the MPR decision would have to be studied more closely before she would comment on whether the international community would now push for an international tribunal. Many UN sources in East Timor say that the international community has little appetite for organising prosecutions because they would be extremely expensive and would risk further destabilising Indonesia. This sentiment is reflected in a UN proposal to cut by almost half the number of international investigators looking into last year's atrocities. Senior UN officials and East Timorese political leaders such as Jose \"Xanana\" Gusmao are also advocating reconciliation rather than justice. But their calls are mostly falling on deaf ears. \"We endured 25 years of hell under Indonesian occupation,\" said Augusto da Silva, a farmer. \"Not only do we want justice, but we need justice in order to put the past behind us and move on.\"",

      "body": "<p>Relationships involving genital herpes are often tricky. It was therefore hardly surprising when Glaxo Wellcome and Cantab Pharmaceuticals revealed yesterday that they were scaling down their collaboration on the disease. They have been co-developing two products for herpes - one to prevent infection and the other to treat it. </p> <p>Regulators have ordered Glaxo Wellcome to end its involvement in the preventative vaccine. After its merger with SmithKline Beecham, the pharmaceuticals group will have too many products in the area - Zovirax and Famvir, to name just two. </p> <p>This sent Cantab Pharmaceuticals' shares tumbling 25p to 313.5p, which appears to be an overreaction. The herpes vaccine is merely the third product in Cantab Pharmaceuticals' portfolio, after products for genital warts and cervical cancer. </p> <p>Glaxo Wellcome had agreed to fund phase three trials of the vaccine, which will cost several million pounds.

      "bodyText": "Relationships involving genital herpes are often tricky. It was therefore hardly surprising when Glaxo Wellcome and Cantab Pharmaceuticals revealed yesterday that they were scaling down their collaboration on the disease. They have been co-developing two products for herpes - one to prevent infection and the other to treat it. Regulators have ordered Glaxo Wellcome to end its involvement in the preventative vaccine. After its merger with SmithKline Beecham, the pharmaceuticals group will have too many products in the area - Zovirax and Famvir, to name just two. This sent Cantab Pharmaceuticals' shares tumbling 25p to 313.5p, which appears to be an overreaction. The herpes vaccine is merely the third product in Cantab Pharmaceuticals' portfolio, after products for genital warts and cervical cancer. Glaxo Wellcome had agreed to fund phase three trials of the vaccine, which will cost several million pounds. In breaking the agreement, it will have to make a fairly big compensation payment. It was always the case that Cantab Pharmaceuticals would retain the intellectual property rights for the product so the break-up should not be too complicated. The wild card question is how the setback will affect Cantab Pharmaceuticals' ongoing merger negotiations with another Cambridge-based vaccine specialist, Peptide Therapeutics. Discussions have been under way for several months, and an agreement had been expected imminently. Yesterday's setback is unlikely to be a deal-breaker. Cantab Pharmaceuticals remains the stronger partner in the merger. Peptide has had several setbacks on key products, and its shareholders are anxious to see it pool its research line with a rival. At \u00a3139m, Cantab Pharmaceuticals' valuation appears relatively modest. All biotech shares are risky, but yesterday's fall is a buying opportunity for investors seeking a modest wager.",

His original upright model was made of wood and tin, with a cloth bag as a filter.

Three years later, it became just the Hoover Company. </p> <p>For nearly 70 years Hoover and its rivals produced similar upright vacuum cleaners, adding features such as lights or variable suction levels.

      "body": "<p>Diageo and Pernod Ricard wrong-footed the rest of the spirits industry yesterday by announcing that they are to team up to make a joint offer for Seagram's $7bn (\u00a34.5bn) international drinks portfolio. </p> <p>The surprise combination was immediately taken as the favourite to win the auction, causing panic selling during the morning in the shares of rival bidder Allied Domecq. </p> <p>Diageo, the world's biggest drinks group, had been negotiating a joint bid with Bacardi, the Bermuda-based group best known for its rum. Talks collapsed earlier this week and the company began secret discussions with Paris-based Pernod. </p> <p>Pernod's joint-managing director, Richard Burrows, said: \"This is a unique opportunity within the wines and spirits industry - it is unusual for a business of the importance of Seagram to come on to the market.\" </p> <p>Mr Burrows said that Pernod was particularly interested in acquiring Seagram's Scotch whisky brands - which include Chivas Regal and The Glenlivet.

      "bodyText": "Diageo and Pernod Ricard wrong-footed the rest of the spirits industry yesterday by announcing that they are to team up to make a joint offer for Seagram's $7bn (\u00a34.5bn) international drinks portfolio. The surprise combination was immediately taken as the favourite to win the auction, causing panic selling during the morning in the shares of rival bidder Allied Domecq. Diageo, the world's biggest drinks group, had been negotiating a joint bid with Bacardi, the Bermuda-based group best known for its rum. Talks collapsed earlier this week and the company began secret discussions with Paris-based Pernod. Pernod's joint-managing director, Richard Burrows, said: \"This is a unique opportunity within the wines and spirits industry - it is unusual for a business of the importance of Seagram to come on to the market.\" Mr Burrows said that Pernod was particularly interested in acquiring Seagram's Scotch whisky brands - which include Chivas Regal and The Glenlivet. The French group already owns a selection of middle-ranking brands, including Aberlour and Clan Campbell and the Irish whiskey, Jameson. Industry experts reckon that Pernod would take on the majority of Seagram's brands, with Diageo picking up the American group's Crown Royal whisky, Captain Morgan rum and various wines for around $1.5bn. Analyst Philip Hawkins of Merrill Lynch said: \"It's a marvellous combination - they can probably afford to pay more than anyone else.\" Seagram's wines and spirits portfolio is the third biggest in the industry. Allied Domecq, which ranks second, is anxious for a deal in order to close the gap with Diageo. Allied's shares plunged 8% yesterday morning on fears that the extra competition may tempt the company to overpay, although the price later recovered to close down 4p to 322p. Advisers to Allied rejected suggestions that the company could be squeezed out of the race. One said: \"Alliances are always weaker than single bidders.\" Allied maintains that it could raise enough money to make a $7bn cash bid for the business, while still having the cashflow to cover its interest payments three times over. A possible third bid could come from the Bronfman family, which founded Seagram. The Bronfmans are understood to be reluctant to lose control of the drinks business. Sources close to the transaction said that Seagram's adviser, Morgan Stanley, was likely to publish an information memorandum within the next week giving details of the businesses for sale. Seagram is refocusing on the entertainments industry - it is about to merge with the French group, Vivendi. Diageo and Pernod are likely to escape close regulatory scrutiny if their bid is successful. Some brands could fall through the net - it is understood that neither side is keen to take on Martell cognac. Members of Pernod's controlling family have made it clear that they would be prepared to dilute their control of the business if this was necessary to secure a substantial deal. Mr Burrows said: \"Scale is important. It is no secret that we want to expand. The creation of Diageo was a spur for everybody to look for more size in this industry.\"",

      "body": "<p>The legal rules which allow unscrupulous house sellers to \"gazump\" their buyers are something that dodgy landlords seem to increasingly believe they can also take advantage of.</p> <p>Ian Leatherman found this out to his cost after seeing a flat advertised in a Southampton local paper. He and his girlfriend viewed it the same evening, liked it, and agreed with the landlord that they would take it at the advertised rent of \u00a3125 per week from the beginning of the following month.</p> <p>The landlord asked them for a deposit of \u00a3250, which they paid in cash, and gave them a note saying that he had received a \u00a3250 \"holding deposit\". They were to pick the keys up and pay the first month's rent on the day the tenancy was due to start.</p> <p>However, when they called to collect the keys, he told them he had let the flat to someone else who had offered to pay \u00a3135 per week. The landlord told them he was sorry but \"as nothing had been signed I was enti tled to do that\". He claimed to have tried to phone to tell them this. They didn't believe him, but felt they had no choice other than to sim ply take their \u00a3250 back. Fortunately, they could stay in their old flat and so their only real loss was the wasted cost of hiring a van for the day.</p> <p>Had they decided to pursue the matter, a court would probably have awarded them damages and, if they had acted quickly enough, ordered the landlord to let them into the flat.</p> <p>The Law of Property Act (Miscellaneous) Provisions Act 1989, which requires property transactions to be in writing, does not apply to tenancies unless they are to last for longer than three years. Here, as both sides had committed themselves orally, with the receipt helping to prove it, the courts would treat it as a binding contract to grant a tenancy, which would allow Mr Leatherman and his girlfriend to occupy the flat for at least six months.</p> <p>The landlord could be ordered to pay them the \u00a310 a week extra rent he received by letting it to someone else for that six-month period, as well as the \u00a345 it cost to hire the van and a small sum for inconvenience.</p> <p>Even so, the damages would not be much over \u00a3500, and quite sensibly they decided it was not worth taking any action.

      "bodyText": "The legal rules which allow unscrupulous house sellers to \"gazump\" their buyers are something that dodgy landlords seem to increasingly believe they can also take advantage of. Ian Leatherman found this out to his cost after seeing a flat advertised in a Southampton local paper. He and his girlfriend viewed it the same evening, liked it, and agreed with the landlord that they would take it at the advertised rent of \u00a3125 per week from the beginning of the following month. The landlord asked them for a deposit of \u00a3250, which they paid in cash, and gave them a note saying that he had received a \u00a3250 \"holding deposit\". They were to pick the keys up and pay the first month's rent on the day the tenancy was due to start. However, when they called to collect the keys, he told them he had let the flat to someone else who had offered to pay \u00a3135 per week. The landlord told them he was sorry but \"as nothing had been signed I was enti tled to do that\". He claimed to have tried to phone to tell them this. They didn't believe him, but felt they had no choice other than to sim ply take their \u00a3250 back. Fortunately, they could stay in their old flat and so their only real loss was the wasted cost of hiring a van for the day. Had they decided to pursue the matter, a court would probably have awarded them damages and, if they had acted quickly enough, ordered the landlord to let them into the flat. The Law of Property Act (Miscellaneous) Provisions Act 1989, which requires property transactions to be in writing, does not apply to tenancies unless they are to last for longer than three years. Here, as both sides had committed themselves orally, with the receipt helping to prove it, the courts would treat it as a binding contract to grant a tenancy, which would allow Mr Leatherman and his girlfriend to occupy the flat for at least six months. The landlord could be ordered to pay them the \u00a310 a week extra rent he received by letting it to someone else for that six-month period, as well as the \u00a345 it cost to hire the van and a small sum for inconvenience. Even so, the damages would not be much over \u00a3500, and quite sensibly they decided it was not worth taking any action. Had they not been able to return to their flat and had had to move into expensive temporary accommodation the loss would have been much greater. The fact that the sum they paid was described as a \"holding deposit\" makes little difference. The expression suggests that the tenant has paid a sum in consideration for the landlord agreeing to keep the property available. It isn't unreasonable, then, if the tenant doesn't take the property and the landlord has turned away other people who wanted it, for the deposit to be lost. But it is obviously unfair if the landlord is not put under any obligation by accepting the deposit. However, some letting agencies are trying to enable landlords to do just this. More carefully worded receipts than that Mr Leatherman got are used when deposits are taken so landlords can still offer the property to someone willing to pay more. One agency makes the tenant handing over the deposit sign a form saying: \"This deposit does not create a tenancy, and does not require the landlord to grant one. It is merely an indication by the tenant of his or her good faith, and if he or she is subsequently offered a tenancy it will be retained by the landlord regardless of whether or not the tenancy is accepted.\" Words such as these do have the effect that there is not a binding tenancy, unless the landlord subsequently grants one.

One in five of these workaholics takes their laptop on leave with them - compared with only one in 10 two years ago. More than half - 55% - said they had no problem with contacting the workplace while they were away and regard it as part of their job. A quarter were not happy about it but understood why it was necessary. Hot issues for secretaries were revealed in a recent survey by Office Secretary Magazine recently. The biggest thing that made them lose their cool was working late when they had a date - 68% said this was a major issue. Equipment failure and colleagues stealing their lunch from the fridge were high on the list of complaints but a hot office in summer was the biggest irritant. Of the 300 who took part 97% said they wanted air conditioning in the office, especially as it would impress visitors, and 57% said the lack of air conditioning made them unmotivated and unappreciated.",

Putting together an excellent team here at the Association of British Insurers. What was your greatest mistake? Occasions when I have put off resolving a difficult issue. Which deal would you most like to have done? Vodafone-Mannesman. It's undeniably a groundbreaking deal. What do you find most annoying in your staff? Not telling me if I've made a mistake. It's far worse when you realise people are trying to hide something from you! Does your organisation have a \"glass ceiling\"? Certainly not. Which management wisdom is most overrated? Any that suggests you can manage by formula. What will be the big business issue of the next decade? In the financial services industry it will be the ageing profile of the population and government's need to cut down on the amount of protection provided from taxpayers' money. That will hugely increase the market for commercial pensions, long-term care insurance, mortgage protection and so on. What one lesson would you pass on to aspiring managers? Never stop asking: \"Who are my customers?\" And make sure your staff do the same. Which management guru do you believe in? None. Who is your management hero? Alan Greenspan: he's either an immensely skilful manager of the US economy or very lucky. Who is your favourite politician? Gladstone. What phrase or saying do you most over-use? \"Yes -but\". Apart from your family, what else makes you happiest in life? The first swim on holiday in warm water. What annoys you most? A boring answer really: people who shout into mobile telephones. How do you relax? Long walks, reading political biographies and detective stories and drinking red wine. What was your last cultural experience? Don Giovanni at Glydebourne, and American Beauty. What is your favourite city? Edinburgh: it's a complete combination of 18th century architecture and natural beauty and home to some of the world's greatest insurance companies. Do you have a favourite website? www.royal.gov.uk keeps me up to date with my last employer. What is your greatest regret? Not having had a wilder time at university.

      "body": "<p>Forget Freud, the Fantasia of the Unconscious and all that: we're into science here. Occupational psychology is a million miles from the work of the beardie weirdie of Vienna and it has had an effect on everyone's working life.</p> <p>It is a discipline which first made its mark in the first world war with studies on munitions workers and the hazardous effects on them of long working hours and is now in big demand.</p> <p>\"Occupational psychology has contributed to the understanding of skills, aptitude, intelligence and teamwork,\" says Cranfield Business School lecturer in psychology Richard Kriatkowski. Training for a career in occupational psychology and its offshoot discipline, organisational psychology, is long and extensive. This is not something you can qualify for the easy way because of the rigorous standards of the British Psychology Society (BPS).</p> <p>Currently, anyone can set themselves up as a psychologist, says Mr Kriatkowski, something he sees as a scandal. The Institute, however, is working towards statutory regulation for the profession to cut out quacks who have not reached its high standards.</p> <p>Only the BPS can confer chartered status on a trained psychologist and anyone entering the profession should be aiming for this. You need a first degree in psychology, but it must be a degree course which will give you the BPS's graduate basis of registration (GBR) to start you on your way. \"Other degrees, such as joint degrees, will not give you the graduate basis, so you would need to do further study,\" the Society advises, \"But there is provision within the statutes for the exceptional awarding of GBR via a PhD or the Society's Qualifying Examination.\"</p> <p>This is followed by a period of assessment, during which graduates have to show they have the breadth and depth of competence across a range of areas in occupational psychology and this must be done as supervised practice.</p> <p>Supervision lasts a staggering minimum of three years. The areas of knowledge which graduates must possess cover human and machine interaction, design of environments, personnel selection and assessment including test design, counselling and personal development, training, employee interaction, motivation, performance appraisal and organisational development and change.</p> <p>Mr Kriatkowski recommends companies like BT, psychometric test specialists Savill and Holdsworth, the Ministry of Defence, the Employment Service and the Metropolitan Police. \"It has to be real-life experience in a work situation,\" he says.</p> <p>Only around 10% of psychology graduates go on to be practising psychologists and the BPS estimates its numbers of chartered occupational psychologists at around 7,000. They are employed by government departments, large management and accountancy consultancies and other large organisations. There is a growing number of smaller occupational psychology consultancies, some of which specialise, and some university departments have private consultancies attached to them.</p> <p>\"At the moment demand for occupational psychologists is buoyant,\" says Mr Kriatkowski, who currently teaches MBA students. \"This is because of the difficulties of recruitment.

      "bodyText": "Forget Freud, the Fantasia of the Unconscious and all that: we're into science here. Occupational psychology is a million miles from the work of the beardie weirdie of Vienna and it has had an effect on everyone's working life. It is a discipline which first made its mark in the first world war with studies on munitions workers and the hazardous effects on them of long working hours and is now in big demand. \"Occupational psychology has contributed to the understanding of skills, aptitude, intelligence and teamwork,\" says Cranfield Business School lecturer in psychology Richard Kriatkowski. Training for a career in occupational psychology and its offshoot discipline, organisational psychology, is long and extensive. This is not something you can qualify for the easy way because of the rigorous standards of the British Psychology Society (BPS). Currently, anyone can set themselves up as a psychologist, says Mr Kriatkowski, something he sees as a scandal. The Institute, however, is working towards statutory regulation for the profession to cut out quacks who have not reached its high standards. Only the BPS can confer chartered status on a trained psychologist and anyone entering the profession should be aiming for this. You need a first degree in psychology, but it must be a degree course which will give you the BPS's graduate basis of registration (GBR) to start you on your way. \"Other degrees, such as joint degrees, will not give you the graduate basis, so you would need to do further study,\" the Society advises, \"But there is provision within the statutes for the exceptional awarding of GBR via a PhD or the Society's Qualifying Examination.\" This is followed by a period of assessment, during which graduates have to show they have the breadth and depth of competence across a range of areas in occupational psychology and this must be done as supervised practice. Supervision lasts a staggering minimum of three years. The areas of knowledge which graduates must possess cover human and machine interaction, design of environments, personnel selection and assessment including test design, counselling and personal development, training, employee interaction, motivation, performance appraisal and organisational development and change. Mr Kriatkowski recommends companies like BT, psychometric test specialists Savill and Holdsworth, the Ministry of Defence, the Employment Service and the Metropolitan Police. \"It has to be real-life experience in a work situation,\" he says. Only around 10% of psychology graduates go on to be practising psychologists and the BPS estimates its numbers of chartered occupational psychologists at around 7,000. They are employed by government departments, large management and accountancy consultancies and other large organisations. There is a growing number of smaller occupational psychology consultancies, some of which specialise, and some university departments have private consultancies attached to them. \"At the moment demand for occupational psychologists is buoyant,\" says Mr Kriatkowski, who currently teaches MBA students. \"This is because of the difficulties of recruitment. Companies and organisations need to find good people and, in years of full employment, the main task is to keep the good people once you have them.\" Psychology, he says, is a numerate discipline which also involves communication and the discussion of ideas, and for this a graduate needs a good grounding in maths - to GCSE level at the very least. \"Psychology is studying how people be have and think and interact in a fundamental way, based on empirical research and examination of theory,\" he says. \"Management trends can become flavour of the month without data to back them up. Psychologists have been trained to have a sceptical attitude about the efficacy of different processes.\" The BPS has close links with the Chartered Institute of Personnel and its members have taken up development and ideas from psychologists.

He looked at the fairness or otherwise in the use of selection tests for the Civil Service. \"We were working on how to get agreement on what was fair and unfair. What is a fair test anyway?\" he asks. \"Selection tests had an enormous adverse impact on ethnic minorities.

      "bodyText": "Some areas of UK management have a long way to go when it comes to encouraging diversity in the workforce. \"Things have progressed,\" says occupational psychologist Binna Kandola, co-founder of Oxford-based consultancy Pearn Kandola. \"But in many organisations there is a lack of understanding of what diversity is in practice.\" On diversity, he says, many organisations have policies in place. \"It is easy to develop a policy but that is only the end of the beginning. Sometimes the follow-through is not there,\" he says. Diversity is one area in which Pearn Kandola specialises. Recent work includes a Europe-wide audit for Ford and work for Abbey National, and Hewlett Packard. Dr Kandola's own studies for his PhD, sponsored by the Runnymede Trust, highlighted the early signs of unconscious racial and gender bias. He looked at the fairness or otherwise in the use of selection tests for the Civil Service. \"We were working on how to get agreement on what was fair and unfair. What is a fair test anyway?\" he asks. \"Selection tests had an enormous adverse impact on ethnic minorities. They would be the first stage of application but did not come through the test sessions - there was an enormous fall-off.\" His consultancy avoids the use of selection tests, favouring instead a work sample test. Candidates are put through a realistic simulation of what the job actually entails. \"This has proven to be fairer.

For personal assistant Jane Lewis, the journey to the winner's enclosure has been arduous.

It's worth bearing in mind that, generally, prize money for jumpers is less than for flat racing. Syndicates come in sizes to suit all pockets.</p> <p>Cheltenham Racing Ltd, which is linked to Cheltenham racecourse, has been running an owners' club since 1993. For \u00a3230 annual membership plus a \u00a325 joining fee, you get a club badge, car park label, and use of the marquees at the National Hunt Festival. You also get free admission to the course when your horse is running and eight stable visits a year. Currently, the syndicate runs four National Hunt horses with a restricted membership of 250 people.</p> <p>If you have more to spend, Delta Bloodstock Management, based in Newmarket, has a syndicate of 20 people with shares starting at \u00a33,000. This covers all equity, training and management fees for a year. The syndicate is currently running seven flat horses.</p> <p>Partnerships can be formed with as few as two or four people. The cost of the horse is paid for up front and a variable amount paid each month for the training and running fees. Partners have to register with the Jockey Club and are also liable for occasional running expenses such as veterinary and blacksmiths' fees.</p> <p>Partners can name their horse and choose the colours in which they will run. The services of a good bloodstock agent or trainer are essential in buying the animal. The two big auction houses, Tattersalls and Doncaster Blood Sales, each have several public auctions during the year where a range of animals from foals, yearlings and two-year-olds will be available. In 1999 the average price paid for a yearling at public auction was \u00a330,450 and for a two-year-old in training \u00a313,000.</p> <p>Choosing a trainer is almost as difficult as choosing a horse. Some owners like to visit their animals often and follow them from meet to meet; others are quite happy to let the trainer make the decisions. The British Horseracing Board's website gives brief details of trainers such as how many winners, how many horses in their yard and their philosophy towards owners.</p> <p>James Bethall, who runs a number of syndicates from his yard at Leyburn in north Yorkshire, advocates owner involvement. \"They are most welcome to come to the stables and watch us gallop the horses. I regard every horse as an investment into which I put my knowledge and expertise.\"</p> <p>The board also runs a twice-yearly owner seminar to give prospective buyers an overview of what horse ownership is all about. The semi nars are held at Epsom in April and Newmarket in September and last two days. The subject matter covers essentials about setting up and running a partnership, the role of the bloodstock agent and how to choose a trainer.</p> <p>They cost \u00a3225 plus VAT per delegate, but if you become a registered owner within 12 months you will be entitled to a full refund of the fee plus a year's free membership of the Thoroughbred Breeders Association, worth \u00a375, and a year's free membership of the Racehorse Owners Association, worth \u00a380.</p> <p>And the rewards? It may not be the place to put your pension, but if you buy a winner, it could well provide a pension. Earth Summit, owned by the Summit Partnership and winner of the 1998 Grand National, cost the miserly sum of \u00a36,090 and has so far won in excess of \u00a3373,000. Istabraq, the Champion Hurdler, which cost \u00a339,900, has notched up more than \u00a3847,000 and See More Business, the Tote Gold Cup winner bought for \u00a35,880, has passed the \u00a3400,000 mark.</p> <p>This year alone the estimated prize fund at Britain's 59 racecourses is expected to exceed \u00a370m, ranging from a guaranteed \u00a3160 appearance fee for all Sunday runners up to \u00a31m for the Derby.</p> <p>British Horse Racing Board, 0207-396-0011 <a href=\"http://www.bhb.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.bhb.co.uk</a>; The Jockey Club, 0207-486-4921 <a href=\"http://www.thejockeyclub.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.thejockeyclub.co.uk</a>; Racehorse Owners Association, 0207-408-0903; National Trainers Federation, 01488-71719; Racecourse Association Ltd, 01344-625612 <a href=\"http://www.comeracing.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.comeracing.co.uk</a>; Cheltenham Racing Ltd, 01242-255682 <a href=\"http://www.cheltenham.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.cheltenham.co.uk</a>; Delta Bloodstock Management, 01638-668065.</p>",

Some owners like to visit their animals often and follow them from meet to meet; others are quite happy to let the trainer make the decisions. The British Horseracing Board's website gives brief details of trainers such as how many winners, how many horses in their yard and their philosophy towards owners. James Bethall, who runs a number of syndicates from his yard at Leyburn in north Yorkshire, advocates owner involvement. \"They are most welcome to come to the stables and watch us gallop the horses. I regard every horse as an investment into which I put my knowledge and expertise.\" The board also runs a twice-yearly owner seminar to give prospective buyers an overview of what horse ownership is all about. The semi nars are held at Epsom in April and Newmarket in September and last two days. The subject matter covers essentials about setting up and running a partnership, the role of the bloodstock agent and how to choose a trainer. They cost \u00a3225 plus VAT per delegate, but if you become a registered owner within 12 months you will be entitled to a full refund of the fee plus a year's free membership of the Thoroughbred Breeders Association, worth \u00a375, and a year's free membership of the Racehorse Owners Association, worth \u00a380. And the rewards? It may not be the place to put your pension, but if you buy a winner, it could well provide a pension. Earth Summit, owned by the Summit Partnership and winner of the 1998 Grand National, cost the miserly sum of \u00a36,090 and has so far won in excess of \u00a3373,000. Istabraq, the Champion Hurdler, which cost \u00a339,900, has notched up more than \u00a3847,000 and See More Business, the Tote Gold Cup winner bought for \u00a35,880, has passed the \u00a3400,000 mark. This year alone the estimated prize fund at Britain's 59 racecourses is expected to exceed \u00a370m, ranging from a guaranteed \u00a3160 appearance fee for all Sunday runners up to \u00a31m for the Derby.

He still, however, commuted regularly to Lancashire for Rovers' games. He had helped them financially in the past, but was now able to commit himself fully to the club. Effectively its owner, he remained officially no more than vice-president, although everybody knew who was in command.</p> <p>Some clue to Walker's determination and entrepreneurial style was given by rhymes and slogans which hung on his office wall. One, the gift of a Blackburn printing company, ran: \"If you think you are out-classed, you are/ You've got to think high to rise/ You've got to be sure of yourself before/ You can ever win a prize/ Life's battles don't always go/ To the stronger or faster man/ But soon or late the man who wins/ Is the fellow who thinks he can.\"</p> <p>Another said, simply: \"Rule One, I am always right. Rule Two, when I am wrong, read Rule One.\"</p> <p>Estimated to be the 21st richest man in Britain, the initial transfers Walker funded for Blackburn were relatively unexceptional. But they became more and more expensive, though many were sold on, some at a phenomenal profit. Alan Shearer, the England centre-forward, came from Southampton in July 1992 for \u00a33.3m, then, having helped Blackburn win the championship, moved on to Newcastle United in July 1996 - netting Walker's club \u00a315m in transfer fees.</p> <p>Signing Shearer was a colossal coup for Walker, but persuading Kenny Dalglish to come out of retirement to manage Blackburn was just as important. Dalglish, a renowned Scottish international and manager at Liverpool, had seemingly been devastated by the Hillsborough disaster, but came to Ewood Park in 1991.</p> <p>The following year, after several failures in the play-offs, Blackburn, who had come only sixth in the first division, prevailed and entered the Premier League. Coming fourth in their first season, runners-up in their second, they took the championship in 1994-95, with Shearer establishing a formidable striking partnership with Chris Sutton, himself bought for \u00a35m from Norwich City and transferred on to Chelsea for double that sum in 1999. (He has now moved to Celtic.)</p> <p>When it came to the European Cup in 1995-96, however, Blackburn went out early, and feebly, to Swedish opposition. The following year, Dalglish became general manager, and seemed to spend much of his time on the golf course, leaving the managerial job to his coach, Ray Harford, who found it hard to make the transition.</p> <p>Walker was never tolerant of failure, and, in 1997, Harford gave way to Roy Hodgson, who had managed Switzerland and Inter of Milan. He, too, failed to bring new success to Blackburn, and left in 1998, giving way to the Manchester United coach, Brian Kidd. This was another disappointment, so much so that Blackburn, despite frantic expenditure, dropped out of the Premiership in 1999. Kidd did not last out the following season, being replaced by Graeme Souness, another former Liverpool and Scottish international, and Liverpool manager.</p> <p>Walker was usually a shy and reclusive man, always eager to avoid publicity - except when his team won the Premiership and he exulted on the field. But at the end of 1998-99, he appeared before the fans at rebuilt Ewood Park to exhort them and his players. The ancient stadium had been transformed, a plenitude of back-to-back houses knocked down to accommodate it, not always to the satisfaction of their inhabitants. A plague of rising damp, the collapse of the cotton industry, a local authority which could not keep pace with such depredations: Blackburn Rovers alone, Jack Walker's creation, assuaged the populace.</p> <p>He was just as generous in Jersey, where he successfully established his own airline, and, for many years, subsidised and supported the local First Tower United team, happy to sit among the fans to watch their amateur endeavours. \"I get just as much enjoyment from First Tower as I do from watching Rovers,\" he said. \"I'm just a dedicated supporter. I've travelled to matches with them on the coach, when the windows have been frozen outside and in. I come to every game and reserve games. I just love it. I even get drunk with them.\"</p> <p>\"I was always working,\" he used to say. \"Until I got a chauffeur, I was driving up to 70,000 miles a year for my various companies, and travelling through Europe in the steel industry, mainly to Italy, Belgium and Germany.\" By the time he sold his company to British Steel, it was making an annual profit of \u00a348m.</p> <p>Legends grew up about Walker. In the 1960s, fearful of losing a deal, it is said that he persuaded a taxi-driver to take him through the ravages of Hurricane Donna, more than 1,000 miles down the east coast of America. They arrived, the deal was done - and the taxi-driver received an enormous tip.</p> <p>Colin Jones, the secretary of First Tower, for whom Walker bought a training ground (just as he had done for Blackburn), said: \"He's a very down-to-earth man, who loves nothing better than having a drink and a chip butty with the boys after the game. You would never know he had so much money.\"</p> <p>Married to Carol, who survives him with two sons, Walker lived in a huge house amid 30 acres of grounds in St Helier. Last May, it was announced that he was fighting cancer - news that was all the sadder for the fact that Blackburn, despite his huge expenditure, stayed marooned in the first division of the Nationwide League.</p> <p>Jack Walker, industrialist and football-lover, born May 19 1929; died August 17 2000</p>",

      "bodyText": "An Analysis piece yesterday on railway reforms (Another age of the train? page 17) said Connex South Central was unwilling to give up its franchise before expiry in 2003, thus holding up a replacement. While Connex is negotiating for a new franchise, it has never ruled out relinquishing the present one early. An article on student debt, page 12, A-levels supplement, Clearing 2000, August 17, said most applicants sought the maximum student loan \"as you cannot apply for a top-up later\". It also said the money came in a lump sum or three equal instalments. The Department for Education says students can apply twice and pay-outs can vary: \"If they apply for their loan between the start of the second and third term, they get the funds in two instalments; if they apply in their third term, they get one payment.\" Tampering with the life of Angela Rippon continues. A panel yesterday, page 3, G2, said the former newsreader performed her high kicks on the Morecambe and Wise Christmas show in 1977. She did make a brief appearance that year, but as our correction said yesterday, her famous debut was 1976. This column did err yesterday in naming the actor who played Kookie in the 1958-64 American TV series, 77 Sunset Strip. He was Edd Byrnes, not Ed Burns.

It seems that media images of boys doing well academically fall into either the expensively educated or \"Owl of the Remove variety\".

Morgan Thomas, Wembley, Middlesex \u0095More girls than boys passed the old 11-plus exam, but it was deemed necessary for equal numbers of boys and girls to \"succeed\" to grammar school, so more girls were \"failed\". Surely this affected past A-level results? As one who \"failed\" and then suddenly became top-of-the-class at the local secondary modern, I am now embarking on my masters degree aged 36. I can't help feeling I could have got here 10 years earlier. Celia Fowler, London \u0095Maybe boys would get a more positive image of academic achievement if instead of the now ubiquitous front-page picture of attractive girls getting brilliant A-level results (August 18), there were pictures of some attractive looking boys, or a even a mixed group, doing likewise. It seems that media images of boys doing well academically fall into either the expensively educated or \"Owl of the Remove variety\". Girls shown doing well seem always to be ordinary kids, the sort of person you'd like to meet and, if you are younger, be like. Jane Tomlin, Wylam, Northumberland \u0095The annual school exam hysteria reminds me of a Cup Final. Weren't comprehensive schools meant to reduce the \"winners\" and \"losers\" culture? Max Nottingham, Lincoln \u0095I have taught A-level for nine years, I honestly do not know whether standards have risen, fallen or gone sideways in that time, because the many syllabus changes make comparisons well-nigh impossible. I do know one thing: you cannot measure the achievement of a student in any subject with complete objectivity; we are not weighing potatoes or counting money. John Purser, Hoddesdon, Herts \u0095At 47, I have just had my English Literature A-level result. I see no evidence of a softening of standards since I sat A-levels at a grammar school 30 years ago - the teachers at my FE college were just as demanding and the syllabus and marking schemes seem as rigorous as ever. Tim Griggs, London \u0095A-levels was a lot harder in my days. That's why I didn't get none. K Holmes, Witham, Essex",

      "bodyText": "Labour's manifesto is likely to promise the abolition of fuel poverty among the poor and elderly by 2010 as part of a \"green housekeeping\" package designed to win back support among disadvantaged voters. Next month's party conference in Brighton will be asked to endorse a 12 point plan that would also commit Labour to a national noise strategy, and involve voters in decisions on GM foods and other environmental matters. John Prescott yesterday told Labour activists that the government would bow to demands at their national policy forum in Exeter last month, and seek to overcome fuel poverty in 10 years instead of the 20 years envisaged. That will translate into a firm promise to pensioners (many angry over Labour's 75p a week increase in the basic pension this April) to cut the money they spend on keeping their homes warm to under 10% of their weekly income, the official definition of \"fuel poverty\". The pledge should benefit 3.3m households by offering grants of up to \u00a32,000 to improve home insulation and thereby lower fuel bills. In a letter to activists today, the deputy prime minister will also commit a second-term Labour government to introducing an environmental productivity index (EPI), copying economic models for improving labour productivity. Just as firms constantly seek to get more work out of employees and equipment, so the EPI would generate pressure to create economic growth using less energy and fewer resources. Mr Prescott praised the party's consultative process for enabling ministers to listen to ideas on environmental issues from unions such as MSF and Unison, and from the Socialist Environmental and Resources Association. \"It has allowed us to argue through the difficult issues and test out new policy suggestions,\" he said. \"Our policies are costed, worked-through and credible. Compare our wide-ranging policy process with William Hague's desperate call for manifesto ideas... on the back of an envelope.\" The proposed package for submission to the Brighton conference and then to Labour's manifesto-writing team would include: \u0095 eradication of fuel poverty by 2010, not 2020; \u0095 higher recycling and waste reduction targets and more incentives to reduce waste; \u0095 improvements in energy efficiency, especially in the home; \u0095 more money to develop off-shore wind power and other renewable energy; \u0095 no commercial cultivation of GM crops until 2003 and then only if proved safe for public health and the environment; \u0095 citizen commissions and similar consultative mechanisms to address health and environmental concerns; \u0095 more environmental investment and jobs through energy efficiency programmes; \u0095 leading the fight against climate change, including new ideas for Kyoto-style trades between states on carbon dioxide emissions; \u0095 water supplies at lower prices and with higher quality; \u0095 national strategies to address noise, rubbish and other pollutants; \u0095 neighbourhood wardens to enforce higher standards; \u0095 environmentally friendly public procurement policies; \u0095 action to protect and increase wildlife diversity. Mr Prescott said: \"Our new pledge on fuel poverty gives a flavour of what we will be offering to the electorate - tackling social exclusion, delivering for pensioners, improving our health and protecting the environment.\"",

He just didn't have enough space. There was a flash, a big spray of water and a huge noise.\"</p> <p>Another onlooker said: \"He went about 400ft vertical in the air to do a turn and dived back down again.</p> <p>\"He did that twice, but on the second time he did not pull out of it and plunged into the sea. There was a massive splash. There was no way anyone could have survived that. It was awful.\"</p> <p>Others spoke of debris flying through the air as the shattered plane billowed smoke.</p> <p>\"It was quite a terrible atmosphere,\" said Moira Mogford, 68, a retired air traffic controller.</p> <p>\"One minute everyone was laughing and joking, the next it was an incredible sense of disbelief. Everything went silent, it was horrible.\"</p> <p>Eastbourne borough council, the organiser of the annual event, which last year drew 500,000 people, cancelled the rest of the day's flying but said the air show would continue over the weekend.</p> <p>In the aftermath of the crash it emerged that the pilot had been due to fly a different plane at the air show, but the L39 Albatross he had chosen was substituted for his own Delfin because of a problem with its ejector seat.</p> <p>Three inspectors from the air accident investigation bureau were last night beginning their inquiry into how the plane, built in Czechoslovakia in the 1960s and of a type often used as a training plane for the Red Arrows team, could have been involved in such a tragedy.</p> <p>The accident is the first to have occurred during the nine years the event has been running, and last night council officials were keen to stress it was exceptional.</p> <p>\"It is extremely regrettable that the pilot has died but fortunately no members of the public were injured because the pilot was flying in the exclusion zone, where he was meant to,\" said Barbara Goodall, a member of Eastbourne tourism committee.</p> <p>\"We must stress that everything was done to make this show safe.\"</p> <p>The council said onlookers were being urged to stay out of the sea after two swimmers were taken to hospital after swallowing aircraft fuel.</p>",

The man, who has not been named, was five minutes into his act at a four-day air show in Eastbourne, East Sussex, when he failed to pull out of a diving roll and plunged 2,000ft into the water, just 800 yards from the seafront. He did not eject and died instantly when his two-seater L29 Delfin disintegrated on hitting the water and sank. Emergency services were immediately scrambled, and a diver recovered the man's body. The accident happened at Airbourne 2000, the south coast's biggest air event. The lifeboatman who helped to recover the body said it was extraordinary there had been just one casualty. \"It was 200 or 300 yards from three of the safety boats which were patrolling the area and we are all lucky to be alive,\" said Gary Mead, an RNLI volunteer. A fellow lifeboatman, who gave his name as Brian, said: \"If he had skimmed across the water he'd have gone straight into the crowd.\" Brian's son, 29, added: \"He was coming in at probably a 45-degree angle and tried to pull up but belly-flopped into the sea. He just didn't have enough space. There was a flash, a big spray of water and a huge noise.\" Another onlooker said: \"He went about 400ft vertical in the air to do a turn and dived back down again. \"He did that twice, but on the second time he did not pull out of it and plunged into the sea. There was a massive splash. There was no way anyone could have survived that. It was awful.\" Others spoke of debris flying through the air as the shattered plane billowed smoke. \"It was quite a terrible atmosphere,\" said Moira Mogford, 68, a retired air traffic controller. \"One minute everyone was laughing and joking, the next it was an incredible sense of disbelief. Everything went silent, it was horrible.\" Eastbourne borough council, the organiser of the annual event, which last year drew 500,000 people, cancelled the rest of the day's flying but said the air show would continue over the weekend. In the aftermath of the crash it emerged that the pilot had been due to fly a different plane at the air show, but the L39 Albatross he had chosen was substituted for his own Delfin because of a problem with its ejector seat. Three inspectors from the air accident investigation bureau were last night beginning their inquiry into how the plane, built in Czechoslovakia in the 1960s and of a type often used as a training plane for the Red Arrows team, could have been involved in such a tragedy. The accident is the first to have occurred during the nine years the event has been running, and last night council officials were keen to stress it was exceptional. \"It is extremely regrettable that the pilot has died but fortunately no members of the public were injured because the pilot was flying in the exclusion zone, where he was meant to,\" said Barbara Goodall, a member of Eastbourne tourism committee. \"We must stress that everything was done to make this show safe.\" The council said onlookers were being urged to stay out of the sea after two swimmers were taken to hospital after swallowing aircraft fuel.",

Cardiff coroner Lawrence Addicott, who recorded a verdict of accidental death, heard that Lance Corporal Smith, who was serving with the 1st battalion of the Royal Regiment of Wales, stepped out of the moving personnel carrier in the belief that the battalion was about to go into battle, on July 30, 1999. But as he followed the vehicle it reversed and he slipped and was trapped underneath and crushed, the inquest was told. Captain Malcolm Downey of the Royal Military police special investigation branch said the soldier in the back of the Warrior vehicle would not have been able to tell the driver that Lance Corporal Smith had got out of the personnel carrier because he would have taken his headphones off in the belief that he also was about to go into battle. The driver reversed quickly after deciding that to continue in the same path would have damaged several trees and so breached environmental rules.

A disastrous run for the festival's four-hour centrepiece, the Barbaric Comedies - which has been playing to audiences of only a few hundred - has put huge strain on its already precarious finances. The Spanish epic, translated by the Irish writer Frank McGuinness from the works of Ramon del Valle-Inclan for Dublin's Abbey Theatre, was only half full at its premiere on Monday. With another week to run, and despite heavy discounting of tickets, only around a quarter of the seats have been sold. Last month the festival's artistic director Brian McMaster predicted that if the risk on the production did not pay off the event might go to the wall. \"We are trying to turn it into a piece of popular, spectacular theatre that talks to a lot of people,\" he said. With reviews damning McGuinness's translation as a \"parody, a case of excess run riot\" and, in the case of the Daily Telegraph critic, \"everything that is wrong, and rotten about the Edinburgh international festival\", the writing now seems to be on the wall. But yesterday, despite the increasing sense of doom surrounding the play, McMaster insisted that he had meant the remarks as a \"joke\", and that he would never risk the festival on a single production. McMaster's five-year reign at the festival has been heavily criticised for its lack of adventure and for elitism, while the rival fringe has gone from strength to strength. But he maintains that the point of a festival like Edinburgh is that organisers can take a bet on productions that might otherwise never be staged.

The Low Down, a wry urban love story starring Aidan Gillen of Queer As Folk fame, is the first feature from the Londoner Jamie Thraves, who has already stacked up a mantelpiece full of prizes for his short films. He also shot the award-winning video for Radiohead's song Just. The film is a smart, funny and surprisingly sophisticated story about a group of twentysomething slackers in east London who are drifting towards that pivotal moment in life when mortgages and marriages begin to happen. Critics are already comparing Thraves to Lynne Ramsay, the fastest rising star of the British screen, whose debut Ratcatcher won a Bafta last year and high praise at Cannes. The other big hit of the festival so far has been the Brazilian film Me You Them, which tells the story of a peasant woman in Ceara state who manages to keep three husbands on the go at once.",

Mr Gore's speech was universally seen as the most important 51 minutes of his political life, because he had to calm the worries of a party that feared he was a loser and persuade the general public that he has what it takes to set his stamp on the post-Clinton era. Early assessments were that Mr Gore did what he had to do, energising his supporters and reaching out to uncommitted voters in a more conversational style than he has achieved in the past. Thursday's news that a new grand jury had been empanelled in Washington to examine Mr Clinton's conduct in the Monica Lewinsky affair failed to derail either Mr Gore's big moment in Los Angeles or the politically crucial American media coverage of it yesterday. None of the US television networks featured the Clinton story on breakfast time bulletins, while the Los Angeles Times relegated the story to an inside page. The now officially nominated Democratic presidential candidate and his running mate, Joe Lieberman, lost no time in taking their message to middle America. Only hours after wrapping up the conven tion in California, they boarded a river boat in La Crosse, Wisconsin, to begin a campaign trip down the Mississippi under the banner \"Setting Course for America's Future\". In what many see as the crucial line of his speech Mr Gore told the 4,000 delegates: \"I stand here tonight as my own man, and I want you to know me for who I truly am.\" Those words marked a climactic moment in the vice-president's long and sometimes laboured struggle to define his political personality in terms with which both he and the voters can be at ease. Mr Gore's speech reflected what may be an irreconcilable problem facing not just the Democrats but all third way political strategies. Mr Gore needs to stop the centrist voters, whom Bill Clinton successfully courted, from reverting to Mr Bush, but at the same time he needs to mobilise his own core support to turn out on November 7 and to prevent the left from defecting to the Green candidate, Ralph Nader. Mr Gore's policy prescriptions were generally Clintonite: fiscal discipline (he promised to balance the budget every year he is in office), guaranteed health care for children, prescription drug benefits for the elderly, universal pre-school education, and a continued expansion of community policing (Mr Gore also promised to bring the crime figures down each year). As in Mr Bush's speech to the Republican convention two weeks earlier, there was only a brief discussion of American foreign policy. Mr Gore said nothing about national missile defence.

      "bodyText": "Japan's conservative ruling party is being shaken up by a \"brat pack\" of impatient young MPs who are threatening to topple the prime minister Yoshiro Mori. About 50 Liberal Democratic party MPs elected in the past decade have formed a new group to mount a rare generation-based challenge to the country's ageing leadership. Headed by the sons and daughters of some of Japan's most powerful leaders, they are pushing for economic reform and an end to the wasteful pork-barrel spending that has left the country with the biggest national debt in world history. In a campaign for greater democracy in the LDP, they are preparing to put forward a candidate to stand against Mr Mori as head of the LDP. \"The ruling party has failed to keep up with the rapidly changing times and the shift in voter preferences,\" said Yoshimi Watanabe, one of the founders of the Group to Build a New LDP. \"The quickest way to improve the situation would be to get rid of Mr Mori.\" This outspoken criticism of one's own party is unusual in Japanese politics, which has long been defined by the Confucian values of group loyalty and respect for seniority. But the new group represents a generation of young, mostly urban voters who have been frustrated by the slow pace of change in Japan, which they blame on the hidebound traditions and vested interests of the ruling gerontocracy. While reforms in the private sector have seen companies ditch the inefficient practice of promoting workers by age, the LDP continues to promote government ministers according to how many terms they have served in parliament. As a result, the average age of the current cabinet is 67, with two ministers more than 80 years old. Established less than two months ago, it already looks past its sell by date with ratings of just 20%. By contrast, the new group contains some of Japan's most popular, media-savvy and international-minded politicians such as Makiko Tanaka, the woman most Japanese would like as prime minister. Although the group is criticised as a collection of spoilt rich kids, its members have demonstrated their independence by openly rebuking their parents in parliament. Among the most vocal has been Taro Kono, who has lambasted his father, Yohei - the foreign minister - during committee sessions. \"Our impression of the younger Kono is that he is more like a member of the opposition than the LDP,\" confided one member of the bureaucracy, which is used to manipulating frail ruling party politicians. \"We cannot control him.\" The new group was formed in the wake of June's general elections, which saw the ruling party lose seats and votes, especially in urban areas. \"The result reflects city voters' loathing of the LDP,\" said Nobuteru Ishihara, the head of the new group and the son of Tokyo's governor. \"There is no tomorrow for the party unless this is recognised.\" Partly to appease the new group, the LDP abandoned a bailout plan for the Sogo department store, which led to the country's second biggest corporate collapse. Mr Mori has also agreed to carry out a review of public works projects. It is far from certain that the group can maintain its early momentum, given the mixture of views among its members and the pressures to conform inside the LDP. But among the electorate, expectations are high that the brat pack - which has begun reaching out to young MPs in opposition parties - can act as the catalyst for change. For now however the group is biding its time. \"People say I should leave the LDP or get rid of Mori,\" Mr Ishihara said. \"But my message is please be patient and watch what we do from now on.\" New breed of radical rattles the house Underlining the shift in values in Japan, the politician who has made one of the biggest splashes since June's election is a 32-year-old woman who has been married four times. Hiroko Mizushima, a psychiatrist turned opposition MP, has been the subject of intense media scrutiny since pulling off the shock of the elections by defeating one of the most powerful patriarchs in the ruling party. The attention is partly based on her impressive parliamentary debut, a grilling of prime minister Yoshiro Mori that he described as \"deeply moving\". But it is also because she represents a generation of Japanese whose values are so far removed from those of their conservative parents that they have been dubbed shinjinrui - a new breed of the human. As numerous magazine articles have pointed out, Ms Mizushima is radical both in her politics and her lifestyle. Far from the Confucian ideal of deference to her father - a ruling party MP - she chose to run for the op position Democratic party of Japan after seeing a newspaper advertisement for candidates. She is already refusing to toe the cautious line of her party's male leaders by recommending an alliance with the Communists and declaring that she wants the job of shadow education minister. But her most scathing criticism is reserved for the ruling gerontocracy. \"Elderly Japanese people are becoming unworthy of respect,\" she says. \"If they set a good moral example young people will follow them, but instead they lie and accept bribes.\" In protest against Japanese laws that forbid married couples from having separate surnames, she has divorced the same man three times and set up an internet site recommending others pursue the same strategy. How effective such shock tactics will be in Japan's consensus-driven political world is open to question. But Ms Mizushima says she is not trying to ram her ideas down people's throats, only to offer alternatives.",

      "bodyText": "Nick Brown, the agriculture minister, said yesterday he believed the outbreak of swine fever on East Anglian farms had been contained but that final confirmation would not be received until tests on 31 farms still under investigation had been completed. An optimistic Mr Brown met leaders of the pig industry yesterday and reassured them of extra government help if the outbreak continued. In Brussels, the European commission disclosed that the virus which caused the East Anglian outbreak was very similar to one carried by a wild boar illegally imported into continental Europe from Asia two years ago. Officials believe the contaminated boar may have passed the contagious disease on to a pig which was later imported into the UK with catastrophic consequences. EU experts working at a laboratory in Hanover made the connection after testing blood samples from infected East Anglian pigs. \"It's a new strain, but it is similar to the one that came from Asia. It could be a mutation but it's too early to tell,\" an EC spokeswoman, Andrea Dahmen, explained. The revelation will come as a relief to many farmers in the UK, since it had earlier been feared that the disease was the same virulent strain which swept through the Netherlands in 1997, spreading to Belgium and Germany. Millions of pounds were paid out in compensation during that outbreak and 14m pigs had to be slaughtered before the disease was brought under control. A panel of EU veterinary experts will meet in Brussels on Tuesday to discuss whether the Europe-wide ban on the export of English pigs should be extended or amended. Mr Brown said that by then extensive results should be available from all 31 farms under investigation and from another 100 farms which are under restrictions because of their proximity to the outbreaks or because of some link to them. Despite hundreds of tests over the last week no pig has tested positive since August 12, although there is still time for the disease to incubate in pigs which so far appear to be healthy. The government's chief veterinary officer, Jim Scudamore, said signs were \"encouraging.\" Only five farms have been confirmed with swine fever, Mr Scudamore said, with a further 31 premises reporting sick pigs, but none of the tests on these had so far provided a positive result. Mr Scudamore said: \"I am not going to commit myself on what is happening because it would be very unwise, but... the results seem to be encouraging.\" Farms in East Anglia, Cheshire, Derbyshire, Lincolnshire, Lancashire, Sussex, the Isle of Wight and Dorset have been banned from transporting pigs while tests are carried out. Mr Scudamore said \"Tuesday will be very early to get an all clear for England for swine fever, but if we can show we haven't got the disease spreading the vets might take a decision on whether the ban needs to cover England or a smaller area.\" For example, Yorkshire had no farms under investigation and that could be excluded from export restrictions. John Godfrey, chairman of the National Pig Association, said it was important that the EU's restrictions on pig exports were not allowed to cripple the industry in England. \"The priority is to control the disease... and the Ministry of Agriculture has done a superb job in identifying and making sure that the disease does not spread,\" he said. \"We now have to work out a system to see that those controls do not permanently financially damage quite a lot of pig farmers. We have lost money for two years, we are only just starting to make money again, and this is another body blow.\"",

With their mobile phones and internet savvy, they have applauded the Pope like a rock star, prayed through the night in normally abandoned churches, and queued for hours to pass through the Holy Door of St Peter's.</p> <p>The six-day jubilee of the young, perhaps the largest ever spiritual gathering of Christians, reaches its climax this evening when up to 2m people gather in a field south of Rome for an overnight prayer vigil followed by mass tomorrow morning with the Pope. Those who expected a low turnout for the Roman Catholic church's celebrations of the 2000th anniversary of the birth of Jesus Christ have been proved wrong.</p> <p>Since the youth event opened on Tuesday, with mass rallies outside St Peter's and St John Lateran, observers have been amazed at the number of its participants, and their fervour. Pilgrims have waited patiently in the sun for the chance to confess their sins - not usually a popular activity.</p> <p>It is estimated that around 300,000 people will have made use of improvised confessional tents set up on the Circus Maximus, where the ancient Romans once held their chariot races.</p> <p>Contact with the enthusiastic crowds appears to have given the ailing 80-year-old pope a shot of youthful adrenalin.

      "bodyText": "Rome has not seen the like of these pilgrims before. With their mobile phones and internet savvy, they have applauded the Pope like a rock star, prayed through the night in normally abandoned churches, and queued for hours to pass through the Holy Door of St Peter's. The six-day jubilee of the young, perhaps the largest ever spiritual gathering of Christians, reaches its climax this evening when up to 2m people gather in a field south of Rome for an overnight prayer vigil followed by mass tomorrow morning with the Pope. Those who expected a low turnout for the Roman Catholic church's celebrations of the 2000th anniversary of the birth of Jesus Christ have been proved wrong. Since the youth event opened on Tuesday, with mass rallies outside St Peter's and St John Lateran, observers have been amazed at the number of its participants, and their fervour. Pilgrims have waited patiently in the sun for the chance to confess their sins - not usually a popular activity. It is estimated that around 300,000 people will have made use of improvised confessional tents set up on the Circus Maximus, where the ancient Romans once held their chariot races. Contact with the enthusiastic crowds appears to have given the ailing 80-year-old pope a shot of youthful adrenalin. And his severe stand on questions of sexual morality does little to deter the young pilgrims, many of whom tranquilly follow an easier line of their own. The success in mobilising such a large number of young people bodes well for the future of the church at the beginning of the third millennium. Religious songs, meditation and prayer have filled the churches and monasteries of Rome, where, in normal times, repetitive liturgies are uninspiringly performed for a dwindling, ageing audience. \"I really thought it was crazy. I thought it was a complete waste of time, but when you see it, you feel the faith, you feel the fervour,\" said Farley Clinton, an American Vaticanologist based in Rome. Mr Clinton said that he had been struck by the commitment of the pilgrims and did not share the misgivings of those who detected echoes of the mass rallies of totalitarian regimes. \"Here you have people coming from the ends of the earth to rally around the symbol of a traditional religion. I don't in the least feel this is a mass thing.

      "bodyText": "The Millennium Dome's chief executive has apologised after a member of staff humiliated a group of severely disabled children for making noises when they were happy. The children, with physical and learning disabilities, had found it difficult to enjoy the more frenetic aspects of the dome but found pleasure in the calming music and lights of the rest zone. They showed their pleasure by humming, muttering and occasional clapping of their hands. This proved too much for the able-bodied visitors in the zone, on whose behalf a female staff member asked the group to be quiet or leave. Adrian Gordon, development officer for Islington social services, who was escorting the children, said the noises were \"a part of the children's personality, which can't be 'switched off' on demand\". The group chose to leave rather than make a scene, but Mr Gordon wrote a letter of complaint to dome management on behalf of the children's angered parents. Mr Gordon pointed out that the rest zone was one of the few areas the party had found stimulating during their visit in April. Elsewhere in the dome, there was a lack of the space and time the children needed to make decisions or carry out movements. \"As a group we paid over \u00a3200 to go to the dome only to find that for some of them, the only area they found stimulating was inaccessible because of the need to respect the needs of 10 other (able-bodied) people in there. \"It is worth mentioning that the majority of visitors did not respect the needs of our group when it came to viewing displays or trying to take part in areas such as the play zone.\" Mr Gordon said that although the toilets were spacious, they did not have a suitable changing bench, which meant some young people had to lie on the floor. However, he noted that some of the dome staff were helpful and friendly. \"Indeed the highlight of the day was an impromptu wheelchair dance outside the dome when a jazz band came over to play to us.\" In a written apology, the dome's chief executive, Pierre-Yves Gerbeau, said: \"We do ask all our visitors to be as quiet as possible within the zone so that everyone can enjoy it.

But that hasn't really been the way it is. The majority of people who live here are really commuters. They need to get to London.\" While many prospective buyers are from the Kent area some hail from London itself, one family is from Belfast, another is from Singapore and there, in the office, poring over a floor plan, is a couple from Hong Kong. In the Chiltern, Eric Elliott, 68, and his wife Oonagh, 65, are pondering the \u00a3385,000 price tag. The couple currently live in High Halstow about 15 miles away but their garden, which overlooks the river Thames, is becoming too much of a handful. \"We are getting older and we want something newer, something that will be easier to look after,\" Mr Elliott said. \"We just know that in six years' time our six bedroom house and garden is going to be too much.\"",

The man aged 35, who has not been named, is recovering in hospital after emergency treatment with antibiotics. Although anthrax cannot be passed on by person-to-person contact, all other workers at the plant have been alerted and informed of early symptoms of the disease, which is potentially fatal if not treated rapidly.

The particularly dark reputation of the infection also owes much to the former \"anthrax island\" of Gruinard, near Ullapool in Scotland, which was declared safe only in 1990 after being used for secret germ warfare tests with anthrax spores during the second world war.

The prime minister personally approved the ban on Sir David Davies, the former chief scientific adviser at the Ministry of Defence, because he used to chair an internal Whitehall committee which advised ministers on the \"best buys\" for defence equipment. Sir David holds enormous inside knowledge about the MoD's defence procurement needs. He applied on retirement last year to join British Aerospace as a member of the strategy board of the Virtual University - an initiative funded and run by BAe. This led to the appointment being referred to Whitehall's advisory committee on business appointments, which recommended a six-month delay in him taking up the job and two year ban on his advising BAe about anything except education and staff training. The committee asked Mr Blair to approve its recommendation, which will remain in force until December 2001. The prime minister's involvement is revealed in the latest report from the committee, which was placed in the House of Commons library as MPs went on their summer recess. The report reveals that restrictions have been imposed on 129 senior civil servants and one minister in taking up private sector jobs. Of Sir David's case it says: \"We were concerned that his early association with this large defence contractor, albeit in an academic capacity, might be viewed with suspicion.\" Mr Blair also approved a six month delay on Air Marshal Sir Colin Terry becoming group managing director of Inflite Engineering, a company which works for defence contractors. Other former civil servants who face restrictions in taking up new jobs include Stephen Littlechild, the former head of the electricity regulator, Offer, who was banned from advising electricity companies seeking licences for a year. Sir David Gore-Booth, the former high commissioner for India, was prevented for six months from dealing with India in his new job as special adviser to the banker HSBC holdings. Another civil servant, Brian Hilton, the former director general of corporate and consumer affairs at the Department of Trade and Industry and the man who ran John Major's citizen's charter office, was handed a six month ban on dealing with any company involved with the competition authorities.

      "body": "<p><strong> Dance <br></strong></p> <p><strong>New York City Ballet <br>***</strong> <br>Edinburgh Playhouse </p> <p>\"Ballet is woman,\" said George Balanchine, a choreographer notoriously susceptible to the beauty of female dancers. Balanchine may have proved a feckless husband off-stage, but on stage he served his ballerinas faithfully, with some of the greatest roles of the 20th century, courting them with delicately nuanced poetry and empowering them with steps of blazingly articulate authority. </p> <p>To his male dancers Balanchine often proved less generous; yet one of the quirks of NYCB's current, erratically danced season at the Edinburgh international festival has been the degree to which the men have dominated the stage. </p> <p>In The Four Temperaments (1946) Damian Woetzel performed the Melancholic variation as a gracefully skewed clown, whose mournful secrets were intriguingly on the point of disclosure. Albert Evans phrased the fractured, jazzy classicism of the Phlegmatic variation superbly. We were as captivated by his own wit as by that of the choreography. Evans also charmed the crowd as the second cowboy in Western symphony (1954). In this frothy piece of Americana, Evans was the perfect feckless dude, and a fine foil to Nicolaj Hubbe's flirty, skinny cowboy in the final movement. </p> <p>Unlike these charismatic men, however, many of NYCB's women seemed to have left their personalities at home. Margaret Tracey displayed some vibrant dancing in Concerto Barocco, but only a couple of dancers - Wendy Whelan and Helene Alexopoulos - reminded us how real ballerinas both command the stage and define the poetry of the ballet around them. </p> <p>Not that Symphony in Three Movements (1972) is balletic in a traditional sense, with its strident corps de ballet and its drastic changes of speed. Yet in the central duet, its volatile energies are concentrated into a love affair of breathtaking intensity. Whelan and her partner Jock Soto not only shaped the choreography's exaggerated detail with stinging clarity but showed us a real man and woman together. All the senses of the two dancers seemed preternaturally alert, so that when Soto inclined his face towards Whelan's arm he seemed to be drinking in the perfume of her skin. </p> <p>In Serenade (1935), Alexopoulos showed a similar ability to convey both the shape and music of the steps and their imaginative life. The fact that she and Whelan are among the more senior dancers in the company gives credence to the worries of certain New York critics that the NYCB's current director, Peter Martins, isn't training up a new generation of ballerinas. </p> <p>For the audience on Wednesday, however, Martins was the hero of the evening, as choreographer of the 1990 ballet Fearful Symmetries. Martins's choreography is actually a far less coherent response to John Adams's huge, scintillating score than Ashley Page's version for the Royal Ballet. But the music is irresistible under any circumstances and Martins does rise to it occasionally, with some grave and feisty invention in his pas de deux. Certainly the dancers seemed to have as much fun dancing it as the audience did watching it. <br><strong>Judith Mackrell</strong></p> <p>Ends tonight. Box office: 0131-473 2000. </p> <p><strong> Theatre </strong></p> <p><strong>Voices <br>****</strong> <br>Traverse </p> <p>One-person shows can often be deadly bores; this one, a European prizewinner from Theatergroep Hollandia, is a striking exception. Based on the writings of Pier Paolo Pasolini, it gives Jeroen Willems the chance not only to play a variety of characters assembled around a dinner table but also to engage in a dialectical debate about the future of a society increasingly run by hypocritical industrialists and corporate apologists. </p> <p>Auden warned us against \"public faces in private places\": Willems gives us a whole gallery. The resident intellectual speaks an arcane language designed to enhance his own power. A top industrialist dazzles us with his expertise. Most disturbing of all, because he is outwardly beguiling and because the words come from a former Shell chairman, is a spokesman for the multinationals who defends the benefits of \"a state within a state\" and who attacks the moral imperialists who question its supra-governmental role. </p> <p>In the course of 90 minutes Willems metamorphoses from male to stilletoed female to horned devil. The show is artfully directed by Johan Simons, but it is not simply a display of versatility. It is really a moral and political debate about a world in which our lives are shaped by unelected experts and in which even governments are subordinate to corporations. The irony is that it deals with the loss of individual power yet it is performed, with silky authority, by a mesmerising soloist. <br><strong>Michael Billington </strong></p> <p>Till August 26. Box Office: 0131-228 1404. </p> <p><strong> Bertrand's Toys <br>****</strong> <br>South Bridge Resource Centre </p> <p>This has nothing to do with those cute stories for kids about the toys that come alive in the nursery when you are not looking. This hour-long performance piece from underground Moscow theatre company blackSKYwhite is a waking nightmare. It is very, very scary. </p> <p>The first thing you notice is the similarity between a marionette and a hanged man. Secondly, you wonder whether the figure you are watching is human or a clockwork doll, such is the appalling flexibility of her jerky joints and the blankness of her leering face. You want to cower under your seat and whimper as the music pounds relentlessly in your head and out of the darkness loom ever more grotesque figures. There is the joker with his juggling balls and a featureless mannequin who is deaf, dumb and blind. These are the toys you keep in the attic and which have escaped to haunt you. You notice that it has started to snow. </p> <p>This show is like a panto that has gone badly wrong, a slasher movie in which you are the victim, a circus act where the clowns have run amok with meat cleavers. You admire its brilliance and hate it for its lack of humanity. It is theatre and it is anti-theatre. <br><strong>Lyn Gardner</strong></p> <p>Till August 26. Box office: 0131-558 9991. </p> <p><strong> Classical </strong></p> <p><strong> Schumann chamber music <br>****</strong> <br>Queen's Hall </p> <p>The first movement of Schumann's Piano Trio in D Minor contains a passage of such strangeness that the entire fabric of the piece seems to collapse into a different musical dimension. A ghostly theme appears in the violin and cello; it hints of recollection but is actually a completely new melodic idea. The way pianist Andras Schiff, violinist Yuuko Shiokawa and cellist Miklos Perenyi integrated this chilling premonition into the remainder of the first movement was profoundly moving. Their account of the rest of Schumann's trio was similarly stimulating: throughout, the players emphasised the poetic flow which characterises so much of Schumann's late music. </p> <p>There was continuity of another kind in Schiff and tenor Peter Schreier's performance of Schumann's Liederkreis Op 24. Schreier may no longer possess the sheerly beautiful voice he once used to, but the wisdom and wit of his singing seems to have increased over the years. Alive to all the irony, bitterness and tenderness of Schumann's settings of Heine's poems of frustrated love, this was a performance of towering intellect. <br><strong>Tom Service</strong></p> <p><strong> Film </strong></p> <p><strong> The House of Mirth <br>****</strong> <br>Odeon/Cameo </p> <p>When Martin Scorsese tackled an Edith Wharton adaptation in The Age of Innocence, the tone was romantic and a little touristic - as if the camera couldn't resist swooning over the silverware. Terence Davies's approach to Wharton is more severe, which may make The House of Mirth seem a forbidding proposition. But his detachment makes for a film that is at once pure Wharton and pure Davies - not that this Visconti-esque costume essay is an obvious choice for the director of the British sitting-room memoir Distant Voices, Still Lives. </p> <p>Wharton's story - sketching the descent of socialite Lily Bart from glamorous heights to ignominious exclusion - calls for both analytic coolness and a flair for evoking social surface. It's a difficult balance, which Davies has hit partly in the inspired casting of X-Files star Gillian Anderson. She has the look of a John Singer Sergeant portrait, and if she is sometimes presented as a mannequin in the film, that suits the way Lily's peers perceive her, as a consummate image. But Anderson really can act: she is subtly deceptive as the Lily who hides her intellect beneath a wryly flirtatious exterior, and finally moving as she rises to the operatic heights of Lily's martyrdom. </p> <p>Other actors you never rated come unexpectedly into their own. Eric Stoltz perfectly embodies the reserve of Lily's never-quite-lover Lawrence Selden; Laura Linney is chilling as Lily's social nemesis Bertha Dorset. Most improbable of all is National Lampoon farceur Dan Aykroyd, playing a boorish, financier who sees Lily as a luxury commodity for the taking. </p> <p>Davies plays the costume game very much on his own terms. Salon furnishings are never just local colour. They flourish when necessary, and at other times are starkly reduced to highlight the dramatic stakes. Lily's initial appearance as a silhouette wreathed in railway steam is an early emblem of the chiaroscuro approach. </p> <p>The House of Mirth is not easy viewing. Davies's script refuses to play down the complexities of Wharton's language and narrative - be prepared to go in with ironic antennae tuned, right from the opening bout of emotional fencing between Lily and Selden. But this is a rare achievement: a costume adaptation that treats its audience like thinking adults. You may even sob a little, too. <br><strong>Jonathan Romney </strong> </p> <p>Tonight at the Odeon and Thursday at Cameo 1. Details: 0131-623 8030. </p> <p><strong>The Beaver Trilogy <br>***</strong> <br>Filmhouse </p> <p>The Beaver Trilogy starts in a car park and ends on an open road; that linear narrative device aside, these three circular, intersecting films are not unlike a M\u00f6bius strip. They encourage scrutiny of the film-making process, of the assumptions we make about it, and of how manipulative it is. </p> <p>In the car park of a television station we meet Gary, a geek with faith in the redeeming power of TV: \"You're on television, you're OK. People take you seriously.\" He encourages a seedy-looking TV producer-director to film the people of his town, Beaver, in their talent show, with him as the star attraction, Olivia Newton Dawn. </p> <p>While the first film, shot like a cinema-verite home movie, has a documentary feel, Beaver Kid No 2, in black and white, is more stylised. Gary's goofiness is replaced with the drama queen persona of Larry, played with camp abandon by Sean Penn. The third film, The Orkly Kid, sees Crispin Glover take on the mantle of Larry and moves the story from that of a small town joker to small town outcast, with a corresponding darker twist. </p> <p>Through the trilogy, the process by which each film is made, and made to elicit particular emotional responses from the audience, is laid bare. By the time Larry/Gary becomes Olivia Neutron Bomb in the third film, the unease is palpable because of what we know from the previous two. </p> <p>The Beaver Trilogy reveals just how predatory and damning television can be of its subjects. Wannabe docusoap stars take note. <br><strong>Gareth McLean</strong></p> <p>Tomorrow and August 25. Box office: 0131-623 8030. </p> <p> <strong> Comedy </strong></p> <p><strong> Boothby Graffoe <br>****</strong> <br>Gilded Balloon Main Theatre </p> <p>If you ever tire of comedy, see Boothby Graffoe. Not only does his set also include music hall, song and theatre, but the comic's wit alone could restore a jaded palate. He benefits, too, from an outstanding supporting cast. Veteran Steve Frost is superb as a comedy butler figure, and Graffoe has recruited Antonio Forcioni, one of the great acoustic guitarists, for semi-comedic duels. After a staggering display of virtuosity from Forcioni, Graffoe shrugs, looks at the audience and quips, \"Has he got a work permit?\" </p> <p>Graffoe is an utterly deadpan stand-up. He is never less than acutely funny, whether improvising (on finding a biochemist in the crowd: \"Have you got a girlfriend? Did you make her yourself?\") or muttering about dogs in space. When the jokes are over, out come the songs: quirky little jewels like Radiator Head Child that have an idiosyncratic beauty worthy of Syd Barratt or Robyn Hitchcock.

      "bodyText": "Dance New York City Ballet *** Edinburgh Playhouse \"Ballet is woman,\" said George Balanchine, a choreographer notoriously susceptible to the beauty of female dancers. Balanchine may have proved a feckless husband off-stage, but on stage he served his ballerinas faithfully, with some of the greatest roles of the 20th century, courting them with delicately nuanced poetry and empowering them with steps of blazingly articulate authority. To his male dancers Balanchine often proved less generous; yet one of the quirks of NYCB's current, erratically danced season at the Edinburgh international festival has been the degree to which the men have dominated the stage. In The Four Temperaments (1946) Damian Woetzel performed the Melancholic variation as a gracefully skewed clown, whose mournful secrets were intriguingly on the point of disclosure. Albert Evans phrased the fractured, jazzy classicism of the Phlegmatic variation superbly. We were as captivated by his own wit as by that of the choreography. Evans also charmed the crowd as the second cowboy in Western symphony (1954). In this frothy piece of Americana, Evans was the perfect feckless dude, and a fine foil to Nicolaj Hubbe's flirty, skinny cowboy in the final movement. Unlike these charismatic men, however, many of NYCB's women seemed to have left their personalities at home. Margaret Tracey displayed some vibrant dancing in Concerto Barocco, but only a couple of dancers - Wendy Whelan and Helene Alexopoulos - reminded us how real ballerinas both command the stage and define the poetry of the ballet around them. Not that Symphony in Three Movements (1972) is balletic in a traditional sense, with its strident corps de ballet and its drastic changes of speed. Yet in the central duet, its volatile energies are concentrated into a love affair of breathtaking intensity. Whelan and her partner Jock Soto not only shaped the choreography's exaggerated detail with stinging clarity but showed us a real man and woman together. All the senses of the two dancers seemed preternaturally alert, so that when Soto inclined his face towards Whelan's arm he seemed to be drinking in the perfume of her skin. In Serenade (1935), Alexopoulos showed a similar ability to convey both the shape and music of the steps and their imaginative life. The fact that she and Whelan are among the more senior dancers in the company gives credence to the worries of certain New York critics that the NYCB's current director, Peter Martins, isn't training up a new generation of ballerinas. For the audience on Wednesday, however, Martins was the hero of the evening, as choreographer of the 1990 ballet Fearful Symmetries. Martins's choreography is actually a far less coherent response to John Adams's huge, scintillating score than Ashley Page's version for the Royal Ballet. But the music is irresistible under any circumstances and Martins does rise to it occasionally, with some grave and feisty invention in his pas de deux. Certainly the dancers seemed to have as much fun dancing it as the audience did watching it. Judith Mackrell Ends tonight. Box office: 0131-473 2000. Theatre Voices **** Traverse One-person shows can often be deadly bores; this one, a European prizewinner from Theatergroep Hollandia, is a striking exception. Based on the writings of Pier Paolo Pasolini, it gives Jeroen Willems the chance not only to play a variety of characters assembled around a dinner table but also to engage in a dialectical debate about the future of a society increasingly run by hypocritical industrialists and corporate apologists. Auden warned us against \"public faces in private places\": Willems gives us a whole gallery. The resident intellectual speaks an arcane language designed to enhance his own power. A top industrialist dazzles us with his expertise. Most disturbing of all, because he is outwardly beguiling and because the words come from a former Shell chairman, is a spokesman for the multinationals who defends the benefits of \"a state within a state\" and who attacks the moral imperialists who question its supra-governmental role. In the course of 90 minutes Willems metamorphoses from male to stilletoed female to horned devil. The show is artfully directed by Johan Simons, but it is not simply a display of versatility. It is really a moral and political debate about a world in which our lives are shaped by unelected experts and in which even governments are subordinate to corporations. The irony is that it deals with the loss of individual power yet it is performed, with silky authority, by a mesmerising soloist. Michael Billington Till August 26. Box Office: 0131-228 1404. Bertrand's Toys **** South Bridge Resource Centre This has nothing to do with those cute stories for kids about the toys that come alive in the nursery when you are not looking. This hour-long performance piece from underground Moscow theatre company blackSKYwhite is a waking nightmare. It is very, very scary. The first thing you notice is the similarity between a marionette and a hanged man. Secondly, you wonder whether the figure you are watching is human or a clockwork doll, such is the appalling flexibility of her jerky joints and the blankness of her leering face. You want to cower under your seat and whimper as the music pounds relentlessly in your head and out of the darkness loom ever more grotesque figures. There is the joker with his juggling balls and a featureless mannequin who is deaf, dumb and blind. These are the toys you keep in the attic and which have escaped to haunt you. You notice that it has started to snow. This show is like a panto that has gone badly wrong, a slasher movie in which you are the victim, a circus act where the clowns have run amok with meat cleavers. You admire its brilliance and hate it for its lack of humanity. It is theatre and it is anti-theatre. Lyn Gardner Till August 26. Box office: 0131-558 9991. Classical Schumann chamber music **** Queen's Hall The first movement of Schumann's Piano Trio in D Minor contains a passage of such strangeness that the entire fabric of the piece seems to collapse into a different musical dimension. A ghostly theme appears in the violin and cello; it hints of recollection but is actually a completely new melodic idea. The way pianist Andras Schiff, violinist Yuuko Shiokawa and cellist Miklos Perenyi integrated this chilling premonition into the remainder of the first movement was profoundly moving. Their account of the rest of Schumann's trio was similarly stimulating: throughout, the players emphasised the poetic flow which characterises so much of Schumann's late music. There was continuity of another kind in Schiff and tenor Peter Schreier's performance of Schumann's Liederkreis Op 24. Schreier may no longer possess the sheerly beautiful voice he once used to, but the wisdom and wit of his singing seems to have increased over the years. Alive to all the irony, bitterness and tenderness of Schumann's settings of Heine's poems of frustrated love, this was a performance of towering intellect. Tom Service Film The House of Mirth **** Odeon/Cameo When Martin Scorsese tackled an Edith Wharton adaptation in The Age of Innocence, the tone was romantic and a little touristic - as if the camera couldn't resist swooning over the silverware. Terence Davies's approach to Wharton is more severe, which may make The House of Mirth seem a forbidding proposition. But his detachment makes for a film that is at once pure Wharton and pure Davies - not that this Visconti-esque costume essay is an obvious choice for the director of the British sitting-room memoir Distant Voices, Still Lives. Wharton's story - sketching the descent of socialite Lily Bart from glamorous heights to ignominious exclusion - calls for both analytic coolness and a flair for evoking social surface. It's a difficult balance, which Davies has hit partly in the inspired casting of X-Files star Gillian Anderson. She has the look of a John Singer Sergeant portrait, and if she is sometimes presented as a mannequin in the film, that suits the way Lily's peers perceive her, as a consummate image. But Anderson really can act: she is subtly deceptive as the Lily who hides her intellect beneath a wryly flirtatious exterior, and finally moving as she rises to the operatic heights of Lily's martyrdom. Other actors you never rated come unexpectedly into their own. Eric Stoltz perfectly embodies the reserve of Lily's never-quite-lover Lawrence Selden; Laura Linney is chilling as Lily's social nemesis Bertha Dorset. Most improbable of all is National Lampoon farceur Dan Aykroyd, playing a boorish, financier who sees Lily as a luxury commodity for the taking. Davies plays the costume game very much on his own terms. Salon furnishings are never just local colour. They flourish when necessary, and at other times are starkly reduced to highlight the dramatic stakes. Lily's initial appearance as a silhouette wreathed in railway steam is an early emblem of the chiaroscuro approach. The House of Mirth is not easy viewing. Davies's script refuses to play down the complexities of Wharton's language and narrative - be prepared to go in with ironic antennae tuned, right from the opening bout of emotional fencing between Lily and Selden. But this is a rare achievement: a costume adaptation that treats its audience like thinking adults. You may even sob a little, too. Jonathan Romney Tonight at the Odeon and Thursday at Cameo 1.

The Beaver Trilogy *** Filmhouse The Beaver Trilogy starts in a car park and ends on an open road; that linear narrative device aside, these three circular, intersecting films are not unlike a M\u00f6bius strip. They encourage scrutiny of the film-making process, of the assumptions we make about it, and of how manipulative it is. In the car park of a television station we meet Gary, a geek with faith in the redeeming power of TV: \"You're on television, you're OK. People take you seriously.\" He encourages a seedy-looking TV producer-director to film the people of his town, Beaver, in their talent show, with him as the star attraction, Olivia Newton Dawn. While the first film, shot like a cinema-verite home movie, has a documentary feel, Beaver Kid No 2, in black and white, is more stylised. Gary's goofiness is replaced with the drama queen persona of Larry, played with camp abandon by Sean Penn. The third film, The Orkly Kid, sees Crispin Glover take on the mantle of Larry and moves the story from that of a small town joker to small town outcast, with a corresponding darker twist. Through the trilogy, the process by which each film is made, and made to elicit particular emotional responses from the audience, is laid bare. By the time Larry/Gary becomes Olivia Neutron Bomb in the third film, the unease is palpable because of what we know from the previous two. The Beaver Trilogy reveals just how predatory and damning television can be of its subjects. Wannabe docusoap stars take note. Gareth McLean Tomorrow and August 25. Box office: 0131-623 8030. Comedy Boothby Graffoe **** Gilded Balloon Main Theatre If you ever tire of comedy, see Boothby Graffoe. Not only does his set also include music hall, song and theatre, but the comic's wit alone could restore a jaded palate. He benefits, too, from an outstanding supporting cast. Veteran Steve Frost is superb as a comedy butler figure, and Graffoe has recruited Antonio Forcioni, one of the great acoustic guitarists, for semi-comedic duels. After a staggering display of virtuosity from Forcioni, Graffoe shrugs, looks at the audience and quips, \"Has he got a work permit?\" Graffoe is an utterly deadpan stand-up. He is never less than acutely funny, whether improvising (on finding a biochemist in the crowd: \"Have you got a girlfriend? Did you make her yourself?\") or muttering about dogs in space. When the jokes are over, out come the songs: quirky little jewels like Radiator Head Child that have an idiosyncratic beauty worthy of Syd Barratt or Robyn Hitchcock. Barratt may have baulked at a line like \"Your heart's in LA, your head's in my fridge\", but then he never had to contend with fighting off a werewolf or the perils of the modern, urban comedy songwriter. \"This is a guitar tuner,\" shrugs Graffoe. \"My neighbours bought it for me.\" Fabulous.

      "trailText": "<p>I went to the National theatre the other evening to see Alan Ayckbourn talking about his new plays, House and Garden.</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>I went to the National theatre the other evening to see Alan Ayckbourn talking about his new plays, House and Garden. Ayckbourn staged the platform interviews in the same way as the plays, moving from the Olivier to the Lyttleton and rotating with the actors - like Jane Asher - who were being interviewed. He was wearing large, all-terrain, shoes. Never was a man less equipped physically for all-terrain work; he described his scramble from one theatre to the other as \"the actors' revenge\" as he sat down panting. </p> <p>Two nights later I went to see House. There had been warning signals in the interviews about the fundamental seriousness of Ayckbourn's views when he spoke of the alienation and remoteness of personal relationships. He cited the mobile phone as an example: in a restaurant he had seen a man chatting up a woman break off for a conversation and he wanted to warn him that this was going to prejudice his chances of scoring. </p> <p>The play itself is often hilariously funny, only marred by the serious bits, which are strangely artificial and trivial: politics is a rum game; political fixers are loathsome ; the squirearchy is degenerate; teenagers are difficult; a woman's lot is impossible. </p> <p>All good material for a comedy, but not new news. By introducing quasi-serious speeches I think Ayckbourn has made a category error, as if he isn't confident the audience can see that life isn't all froth, to use John Prescott's word of the week, and feels obliged to introduce a few homilies. Indeed Jane Asher, as the long-suffering wife, is given the weakest couple of lines I have heard in many a year to close the play. </p> <p>Ayckbourn is concerned about the state of society, as the middle-aged are prone to be. Their assumption is that things were better once. You only have to read Virginia Woolf writing about a woman's lot in 1938 - the heyday of this golden era of public service broadcasting and focus-group-free politics - to know that a more closed society is not the same as a happier society. Things were much simpler in the recent past. As HR Haldeman told Nixon: \"Once the toothpaste is out of the tube, it's goddamned difficult to get it back in.\" </p> <p>Edinburgh is the place where disgruntled or superannuated broadcasting folk sound off. The latest salvo is from Sir John Drummond, once controller of Radio 3 and director of the Edinburgh festival. He trundles out the heavy cavalry with the word \"Philistinism\", which, in the acute gradations of cultural snobbism, is used to refer to anyone who has never sat through the Ring Cycle and doesn't know any Greek. The origins of the word lie with Matthew Arnold in an essay on Heinrich Heine: the English, like the townies or \" Philister \" at German universities, were thought to be inaccessible to ideas. Sir John thinks that baseball caps, worn backwards, are also a sign of Philistinism. The time has come for the walruses of culture to mothball this word, with its intimations of class; the day will never come again when a knowledge of the classics is the starting point for an educated man or woman. </p> <p>That said, Drummond, makes some telling points. The most striking is perhaps the simplest, that culture is not just a question of feeling, or as he puts it, of gratification. I once had the pleasure of interviewing Harold Bloom, who believes that culture begins and ends with Shakespeare. Although this is a dotty idea, Bloom is passionately concerned about the lack of reading in America, by which he means the inability to understand and enjoy the texts themselves. </p> <p>He told me, his voice ripe with derision, that one of his former students is now a leading deconstructionist. It is much easier to mount some trivial theory about the author and his times than to read and understand the language itself. Bloom and Drummond are absolutely right, there are no short-cuts to culture - not the internet, not media studies, not Britart, not relativism. </p> <p>The problem, the deep philosophical problem, however, is in attributing value in a fragmented society. Are we in mourning for a society of posh chaps who knew a lot about everything except the real world or are we trying to produce an undemanding, serviceable education that will equip most people for life as they find it? Drummond's charge is that in TV, radio and politics, the choice has already been made of the undemanding and the superficial. </p> <p>I did note that when he poured scorn on University Challenge, his criticism was of the failure of undergraduates to recognise Hamlet; no doubt he, like me, hasn't a clue about the science questions, but of course ignorance of science is not Philistinism, merely breeding. </p> <p>These islands' greatest golfers are fat, comfortable-looking men. Darren Clarke's rear end juts like a rock ledge as he lights a large cigar on the last green and paddles off to the nearest bar or restaurant with all the contentment of a clubman of old. Little Ian Woosnam is an india rubber ball, no sharp edges visible, as he whacks the golf ball with his outsize driver, the shaft so long that its head cannot lie flat on the green. Lee Westwood, young, prematurely ovoid, looks as though he is eagerly anticipating the arrival of the scooter bringing the pizza, with extra pepperoni, at any minute. </p> <p>And then there's Colin Montgomerie, he of the wobbly pectorals. Monty, after the Open, said he would lose weight. Most professional commentators thought it was a joke, but I thought I detected a certain seething discontent. And sure enough, a few weeks later a trim new Monty was unveiled. Just when it seemed that the Brits had found a sport at which they could excel, one which demanded neither self-denial nor unnecessary exercise, Monty has broken ranks. </p> <p>But being thin - relatively - doesn't suit him.

      "bodyText": "I went to the National theatre the other evening to see Alan Ayckbourn talking about his new plays, House and Garden. Ayckbourn staged the platform interviews in the same way as the plays, moving from the Olivier to the Lyttleton and rotating with the actors - like Jane Asher - who were being interviewed. He was wearing large, all-terrain, shoes. Never was a man less equipped physically for all-terrain work; he described his scramble from one theatre to the other as \"the actors' revenge\" as he sat down panting. Two nights later I went to see House. There had been warning signals in the interviews about the fundamental seriousness of Ayckbourn's views when he spoke of the alienation and remoteness of personal relationships. He cited the mobile phone as an example: in a restaurant he had seen a man chatting up a woman break off for a conversation and he wanted to warn him that this was going to prejudice his chances of scoring. The play itself is often hilariously funny, only marred by the serious bits, which are strangely artificial and trivial: politics is a rum game; political fixers are loathsome ; the squirearchy is degenerate; teenagers are difficult; a woman's lot is impossible. All good material for a comedy, but not new news. By introducing quasi-serious speeches I think Ayckbourn has made a category error, as if he isn't confident the audience can see that life isn't all froth, to use John Prescott's word of the week, and feels obliged to introduce a few homilies. Indeed Jane Asher, as the long-suffering wife, is given the weakest couple of lines I have heard in many a year to close the play. Ayckbourn is concerned about the state of society, as the middle-aged are prone to be. Their assumption is that things were better once. You only have to read Virginia Woolf writing about a woman's lot in 1938 - the heyday of this golden era of public service broadcasting and focus-group-free politics - to know that a more closed society is not the same as a happier society. Things were much simpler in the recent past. As HR Haldeman told Nixon: \"Once the toothpaste is out of the tube, it's goddamned difficult to get it back in.\" Edinburgh is the place where disgruntled or superannuated broadcasting folk sound off. The latest salvo is from Sir John Drummond, once controller of Radio 3 and director of the Edinburgh festival. He trundles out the heavy cavalry with the word \"Philistinism\", which, in the acute gradations of cultural snobbism, is used to refer to anyone who has never sat through the Ring Cycle and doesn't know any Greek. The origins of the word lie with Matthew Arnold in an essay on Heinrich Heine: the English, like the townies or \" Philister \" at German universities, were thought to be inaccessible to ideas. Sir John thinks that baseball caps, worn backwards, are also a sign of Philistinism. The time has come for the walruses of culture to mothball this word, with its intimations of class; the day will never come again when a knowledge of the classics is the starting point for an educated man or woman. That said, Drummond, makes some telling points. The most striking is perhaps the simplest, that culture is not just a question of feeling, or as he puts it, of gratification. I once had the pleasure of interviewing Harold Bloom, who believes that culture begins and ends with Shakespeare. Although this is a dotty idea, Bloom is passionately concerned about the lack of reading in America, by which he means the inability to understand and enjoy the texts themselves. He told me, his voice ripe with derision, that one of his former students is now a leading deconstructionist. It is much easier to mount some trivial theory about the author and his times than to read and understand the language itself. Bloom and Drummond are absolutely right, there are no short-cuts to culture - not the internet, not media studies, not Britart, not relativism. The problem, the deep philosophical problem, however, is in attributing value in a fragmented society. Are we in mourning for a society of posh chaps who knew a lot about everything except the real world or are we trying to produce an undemanding, serviceable education that will equip most people for life as they find it? Drummond's charge is that in TV, radio and politics, the choice has already been made of the undemanding and the superficial. I did note that when he poured scorn on University Challenge, his criticism was of the failure of undergraduates to recognise Hamlet; no doubt he, like me, hasn't a clue about the science questions, but of course ignorance of science is not Philistinism, merely breeding. These islands' greatest golfers are fat, comfortable-looking men. Darren Clarke's rear end juts like a rock ledge as he lights a large cigar on the last green and paddles off to the nearest bar or restaurant with all the contentment of a clubman of old. Little Ian Woosnam is an india rubber ball, no sharp edges visible, as he whacks the golf ball with his outsize driver, the shaft so long that its head cannot lie flat on the green. Lee Westwood, young, prematurely ovoid, looks as though he is eagerly anticipating the arrival of the scooter bringing the pizza, with extra pepperoni, at any minute. And then there's Colin Montgomerie, he of the wobbly pectorals. Monty, after the Open, said he would lose weight. Most professional commentators thought it was a joke, but I thought I detected a certain seething discontent. And sure enough, a few weeks later a trim new Monty was unveiled. Just when it seemed that the Brits had found a sport at which they could excel, one which demanded neither self-denial nor unnecessary exercise, Monty has broken ranks. But being thin - relatively - doesn't suit him. His face, an old-fashioned, relaxed hold-all, has become unnaturally drawn. Nor does the new face go with the relaxed, looping, swing. He wants to be Tiger Woods; he wants to be whippet-lean and toned. I think this is a mistake. A man swinging a golf club, says John Updike, is at his most naked. Wealth, birth and status mean nothing at that moment. The player is utterly alone. Monty is a chubby fellow, with a chubby swing. This swing is untroubled by fine-tuning and introspection, but it may be ruined by diet. The swing may try to escape this regime. As someone said, in every Lean film, there is a fat film trying to get out.",

No matter how many laws we pass to legally enshrine women's equality, Nature is always going to put the boot in. And it's a sad fact that, while women become sexually superfluous after the menopause, a man can have children until the end of his life. Look at Charlie Chaplin - he was fathering babies in his 80s!\" Though, as Nora Ephron pointed out in When Harry Met Sally, he was also so infirm that he couldn't pick them up. </p> <p>But all that man-eternally-fertile/ woman-good-for-15-years-tops eyewash has come in for a right bashing over the past few weeks. First, there were the conclusive studies showing that sperm quality decreases in men over the age of 24, and that it would take a man of 35 at least twice as long as a man of 25 to get the same fertile woman pregnant. In a nice twist on the old clich\u00e9, this means that it is not wise to send a man to do a boy's job. </p> <p>It also means that all that jive from the likes of Dr Michael Odent - about how women should \"purify\" themselves for a year before attempting to conceive, while putative fathers may go on smoking and drinking and generally whooping it up - is a pile of sexist claptrap. (Where I come from, it's invariably the girls who drink and smoke the most who get pregnant quickest - I think it's called being loose.) Can it be any coincidence that, between the ages of 25 and 35, most men will eat their own weight in fry-ups, piss away a river of lager and smoke themselves blue in the face! It's a wonder their sperm can be arsed to move at all: \"Nah, don't fancy it, bruv. Man U's playing. You go instead. And give 'er one from me, mah son.\" How ironic that adhering to the Loaded lifestyle has done far more than the hobnail-booted march of feminism in rendering man \"unmanly\". </p> <p>Then, last week, the much-respected Professor Mel Greaves of the Institute of Cancer Research announced that, if women wished to remain cancer-free, they should have more children far younger - and, more problematically, that men could best avoid the disease by not copulating beyond their prime. Prostate cancer is now the second most common male cancer, diagnosed in 21,000 men each year and killing more than 9,500 of them; this, says Professor Greaves, is because men are not biologically programmed to have sex beyond the age of 50: \"What other mammal, including dogs and our great ape relatives, continues to indulge in sexual activity long after it can successfully compete with younger, fitter males for the favours of the harem?\" he demanded rhetorically. Failure to turn off the \"testosterone tap\", apparently, promotes the growth of fatal cancers. </p> <p>With women now bearing the burden of Aids in Africa (due largely, it is thought, to men's refusal to wear condoms in general, and to the nasty habit of old men forcing themselves on to very young girls in particular - in some parts of Africa, it is thought that sleeping with a virgin \"cures\" a man with Aids) and dropping like flies with breast and cervical cancer at home (cervical cancer itself being widely thought to come from sexual exposure to men, as nuns hardly ever get it), it's a relief to find out that there's something we can't get. And it's the cherry on the top that men would get it less if they only learned to practise sexual continence - something that has apparently been the answer to every last bit of female trouble since time immemorial. </p> <p>Add to this the news that no critics will be allowed to see the new Richard Gere and Winona Ryder film before its release due to audience previews, which ended in hilarity and disgust at the May-September romance (have you ever noticed how that \"September\" is always stuck in to preserve the old guy's glamour, like he's still in the \"Indian Summer\" of his youth? Anyone looking at the 51-year- old Gere next to the 29-year-old Ryder would surely agree that May-November is nearer the mark) and we might venture the guess that the myth of men getting \"better\" as they get older, while women just go south, is well and truly on the skids. </p> <p>Women have been treated like sexual livestock for so long - in training, nubile, past it - that we have long since learned to live with the insults that come with each stage and just get on with enjoying them, anyway. For men, who are encouraged to think of themselves as veritable sex machines from the cradle to the grave, the news that they wither and perish reproductively - just like a woman - is going to take some getting used to. Exactly how differently men and women approach ageing can be seen, interestingly, in aforementioned May-September flings. Unlike many feminists, I have nothing against older men doing it with young women, because they have just as much in common (low sex drive) as do older women going out with young men (high sex drive), as one of which happy breed I am proud to number myself. </p> <p> The difference is that when older women go out with younger men, they don't believe that they themselves are actually still young - if Francesca Annis did herself up in a belly top and braids every time she went to a premiere with Ralph Fiennes, we'd all be laughing, when in fact she dresses like the grand dame that she is. Yet when you see an old man out with a young chick, be he Peter Stringfellow or Jack Nicholson, it's painfully obvious that, when that man looked in the mirror before he went out, he saw a young stud no older than his young girlfriend. But Stringfellow's face looks like Tracey Emin's bed, and Nicholson has bigger breasts than Gisele! </p> <p>To sum up, the only reason younger women ever went with older men is because, historically, men have had more money than women, and marrying a rich old man was the one way to become rich yourself - especially as he'd die before you. Sexually, biologically and in every other way, it makes no sense at all - and finding the idea of Winona Ryder fancying Richard Gere strange but not turning a hair at the idea of the Graduate fancying Jerry Hall shows how far we have come to realising this, even over the past 30 years. Women go out with younger men to get good sex; men go out with younger women in order to stave off their own mortality. It's not hard to see which one of these ambitions is bound to end in tears.</p>",

Unlike many feminists, I have nothing against older men doing it with young women, because they have just as much in common (low sex drive) as do older women going out with young men (high sex drive), as one of which happy breed I am proud to number myself. The difference is that when older women go out with younger men, they don't believe that they themselves are actually still young - if Francesca Annis did herself up in a belly top and braids every time she went to a premiere with Ralph Fiennes, we'd all be laughing, when in fact she dresses like the grand dame that she is. Yet when you see an old man out with a young chick, be he Peter Stringfellow or Jack Nicholson, it's painfully obvious that, when that man looked in the mirror before he went out, he saw a young stud no older than his young girlfriend. But Stringfellow's face looks like Tracey Emin's bed, and Nicholson has bigger breasts than Gisele! To sum up, the only reason younger women ever went with older men is because, historically, men have had more money than women, and marrying a rich old man was the one way to become rich yourself - especially as he'd die before you. Sexually, biologically and in every other way, it makes no sense at all - and finding the idea of Winona Ryder fancying Richard Gere strange but not turning a hair at the idea of the Graduate fancying Jerry Hall shows how far we have come to realising this, even over the past 30 years. Women go out with younger men to get good sex; men go out with younger women in order to stave off their own mortality. It's not hard to see which one of these ambitions is bound to end in tears.",

      "body": "<p>A kinky Cos\u00ec at the Salzburg festival? Whatever next? That was the immediate shocked response to Hans Neuenfels's new production of Mozart's opera at the Kleines Festspielhaus. Not only does it dress all four lovers in identical unisex outfits (including corsets) and Despina in men's clothes, but the heroine, Fiordiligi, sings her big aria of defiance, Come Scoglio, holding the leashes of two men on all fours wearing leather dog-masks. </p> <p>Performance, however, reveals that this vision is intended merely to illustrate Fiordiligi's defiance - just one example of Neuenfels's inventive, if overenthusiastic, use of symbols. So there are no disguises when Ferrando and Guglielmo return as Albanians: the women have drunk the juice of a giant poppy and are just suffering from hallucinations. </p> <p>This is far too busy a production, but the performance is hard to match, with Lothar Zagrosek drawing stylish playing from the Vienna Philharmonic. Karita Mattila as a radiant Fiordiligi, Vesselina Kasarova as a feisty Dorabella and Maria Bayo as a pert Despina make an ideal team of women, with Rainer Trost (Ferrando), Simon Keenlyside (Guglielmo) and Franz Hawlata (Don Alfonso) almost as strong. </p> <p>The other Mozart/Da Ponte opera at Salzburg this year, Don Giovanni, comes in a revival of last year's production by Luca Ronconi. This too is heavily weighed down by symbols, with clock faces littering the stage of the Grosses Festspiel haus, but the 30s setting generally works well. It only loses its way at the end, when the principal characters suddenly grow old and grey. </p> <p>With conductor Valery Gergiev a hectic but electrifying Mozartian, the performance is musically magnetic, with Ren\u00e9e Fleming masterly as Donna Anna and well contrasted with Marina Mescheriakova as Elvira. Ferruccio Furlanetto is a strong, mature Don, and Ren\u00e9 Pape as Leporello gives the most vivid performance of all. </p> <p>Also at the Grosses Festspielhaus, Lorin Maazel has taken over from an indisposed Claudio Abbado for Klaus Michael Gr\u00fcber's production of Tristan und Isolde. Eduardo Arroyo's sets, including a skeletal sailing ship in act one, are undistracting (if not ideally atmospheric) while Maazel, using the widest dynamic range, draws sensuously beautiful playing from the Vienna Phil. It provides rich support for the glorious Isolde of Waltraud Meier, and makes one forgive the lumpishness of Jon Fredric West as Tristan. </p> <p>One major theme at Salzburg this year is French opera, with the showpiece a new production by Herbert Wernicke of Berlioz's epic, The Trojans. Still ignored at the Paris Opera after almost 150 years, this gloriously wilful masterpiece comes in a warmly idiomatic performance with the Orchestre de Paris and a French conductor, Sylvain Cambreling. Though Wernicke's production, using a stage cliche, has modern combat troops carrying Kalashnikovs, the simple white semi-circular permanent set works well. Deborah Polaski is a pillar of strength as both Cassandra and Dido. Next to her, Jon Villars as Aeneas is rather a stolid hero. </p> <p>It was good, too, to have the last of the reform operas that Gluck wrote for Paris, Iphig\u00e9nie en Tauride. This was bitingly compact, with Ivor Bolton drawing stylish playing from the Mozarteum Orchestra. That and superb singing from the three American principals - Susan Graham in the title role, with Thomas Hampson as Oreste and Paul Groves as Pylade - made it easier to accept an uninspired production by Claus Guth. He failed totally to exploit the atmosphere of the courtyard of the Residenz Palace, again relying on the cliche of updating, with the women in Victorian black and the men in combat trousers.</p>",

The 17th Brecon jazz festival, with its 90-odd gigs packed into 48 hours, showed that it could be both. </p> <p>This year Regina Carter, a virtuoso of the violin - an instrument with an obscure place in jazz despite the fame of Stephane Grappelli - took the audience by storm. Lady Be Good has always offered fertile ground for improvisers, but the New Yorker pushed the old standard towards new horizons. </p> <p>Dr John, an elegant and eager pianist with three Grammy awards under his belt, and Bud Shank, a professor of the cool school of West Coast music, also made it across the pond to the mid-Wales town, which coped perspiringly with an influx of around 50,000 visitors. Shank, a mannered saxophonist who played with Stan Kenton and Charlie Barnett half a century ago, recalled the tribute paid to him by Duke Ellington: \"He even shook Johnny Hodges - he is something else.\" </p> <p>George Melly, an honorary Brecon citizen who used to live near the town and fished in the River Usk with ferocious determination, tirelessly champions the festival.

This year Regina Carter, a virtuoso of the violin - an instrument with an obscure place in jazz despite the fame of Stephane Grappelli - took the audience by storm. Lady Be Good has always offered fertile ground for improvisers, but the New Yorker pushed the old standard towards new horizons. Dr John, an elegant and eager pianist with three Grammy awards under his belt, and Bud Shank, a professor of the cool school of West Coast music, also made it across the pond to the mid-Wales town, which coped perspiringly with an influx of around 50,000 visitors. Shank, a mannered saxophonist who played with Stan Kenton and Charlie Barnett half a century ago, recalled the tribute paid to him by Duke Ellington: \"He even shook Johnny Hodges - he is something else.\" George Melly, an honorary Brecon citizen who used to live near the town and fished in the River Usk with ferocious determination, tirelessly champions the festival.

      "body": "<p>Back in 1992, long before Ireland began its dizzying economic upward curve, a group of theatregoers huddled into Dublin's cramped Project theatre to witness The Emergency Session, an evening of hardcore Celtic gangsta-rap, presented by the country's most celebrated young company, Rough Magic. As the lights came down over thumping breakbeats, our MC, a hip-hop reincarnation of Ireland's first president and guiding spiritual father, Eamon de Valera, pimp-rolled onstage to the rhythm, spitting out the verses in that priestly county Limerick twang so familiar to the home audience. </p> <p>Numbers included Cead Mile Failte [100,000 welcomes], Bitch, an indictment of the Republic's treatment of women, and Neutral, More or Less, about Ireland's famed nudge-and-wink neutrality. However, the most memorable moment came with a tongue-in-cheek vision called Eire 2016AD, which conjured up a rosy picture of the state a century on from the uprising against British rule that led to its foundation: \"This country's really moving, the economy's improving,\" rapped MC Dev to incredulous guffaws, before following up with the queasy prediction: </p> <p> \"We all know how it's going to be, don't we? <br>One big theme park, a quaint holiday, <br>Unless you're female or homeless or gay. <br>But we won't let reality get in the way, <br>Here in theme park Ireland, Slainte, have a nice day...\" </p> <p>Returning to live in Ireland after almost 10 years away, I have often been struck by the eerie prescience of that show, a cassette of which I carried with me on my odyssey first to London and then to St Petersburg. What was then so preposterous that it barely made sense in the realm of satire has now miraculously become a reality. From a basket-case economy that ran up such debilitating international debt in the late 70s and 80s that the IMF seriously considered foreclosure in 1986, Ireland has been transformed into the mythical Celtic Tiger, a technological overachiever with double digit growth rates approaching three times the European average. </p> <p>Unemployment, which approached 20% in the 80s, is now down to 4%, and the debilitating, centuries-old emigration trend has been shunted into reverse. In the most startling development, Ireland is now the world's biggest exporter of computer software, nudging ahead of America for the first time last year. </p> <p>Entirely new stereotypes have displaced the downtrodden models of the past: \"Striding through the streets of Dublin these days,\" gushed Fortune magazine late last year, \"is an entirely new species of Irishman and Irishwoman: educated, optimistic and affluent - unaffected by the twin demons of poverty and despair that hounded their ancestors for the last several hundred years.\" </p> <p>And the Irish Times recently claimed: \"There is now a real surge of power in the Celtic psyche, where the Irish in the world are seen as models for business acumen, drive, ambition, political and social progress and achievements in the arenas of music, sport and literature.\" </p> <p>Yet despite the frothy rhetoric - which appears to have intoxicated most politicians - it is difficult to escape the sense that the Irish were still refusing to let \"reality get in the way\". Certainly the Dublin that greeted me was not the vibrant model capital of these congratulatory profiles, but largely the same scattered, grubby and vaguely planned provincial city I'd left 10 years ago, though now far more polluted and congested. House prices had gone up 300-500% and, as was obvious from the blankets and bundles in shop doorways across the city, homelessness had reached conspicuous, Thatcherite proportions, rising by 150% in the past year. Though there were considerably more jobs around, few people in my immediate circle were materially better off, and many felt the opposite. </p> <p>And the general mood among many commentators was far from celebratory: \"The economic boom has not really reflected itself on the basics of what people expect of living in a decent society,\" says author and columnist Fintan O'Toole, \"A lot of the impact has been negative, in that it is much more difficult to buy a house, to travel around the capital, and to access a lot of basic services.\" Far from being a nation finally at peace with itself and comfortable with its new-found affluence, Celtic Tiger Ireland seems increasingly fraught with contradictions. </p> <p>Few economists or politicians predicted this and, consequently, even fewer have any idea of what course it will take in the future. It is also an economic recovery that happened almost entirely independently of the Irish business elite, who had conspicuously failed for decades to lift the country out of terminal depression. </p> <p>The Celtic Tiger was essentially created not by the Irish but by American hi-tech multinationals, eager to find a convenient launch-pad into Europe and attracted to Ireland by its educated and moderately rewarded workforce, Euro-friendly orientation, and crucially, by its rock-bottom 10% rate of corporate tax (compared to 40% in Germany and over 30% in Britain). Put bluntly: \"It was based on criminally low taxation rates to attract foreign industry,\" says writer and journalist John Waters. \" In effect, Ireland became a laundering operation for multinational industry in order to avoid tax.\" </p> <p>By the mid-90s, this was beginning to bear fruit: $7bn direct investment in 1997 alone. The impact has been most beneficially felt in the employment market. Jobs have become so freely available that Ireland, once Europe's greatest exporter of humanity, has now begun to run out of people - every shop or restaurant window in Dublin now displays \"help wanted\" notices, computer programmers are recruited en masse from Russia and navvies shipped in from London. Meanwhile, wages for the majority of the Irish inhabitants have been kept artificially low by a \"social partnership\" agreement and still weigh in at just 80% of the European average. </p> <p>Corruption is now ancient history <br>There were no convictions (obviously) <br>Well, different standards applied at the time, <br>We didn't know taking a bribe was a crime, <br>It used to be called a consultancy fee <br>Way back in 2015AD. </p> <p>No other single factor has done quite so much to undermine the inflated rhetoric of the boom than the constant revelations flowing from tribunals set up to investigate massive wrongdoing by the political and business elite in the 70s, 80s and early 90s. Irish politics is now not merely tainted by corruption, but characterised by it. The definitive Irish sleaze bible is an engrossing little tome entitled This Great Little Nation: the A-Z of Irish Scandals and Controversies. It was written by Gene Kerrigan and Pat Brennan, and runs to over 300 pages of epic wrongdoing in the beef industry, a little priestly paedophilia, land re-zoning scams, bribe-taking, party political cronyism and a massive banking tax evasion scheme. </p> <p>At the centre of the vast web of political scandal is Charles Haughey, the country's taoiseach - prime minister - throughout much of the 80s and early 90s. It transpires that Haughey supported a lavish lifestyle by soliciting \"donations\" from businessmen totalling some IR\u00a38m, and misdirected party funds, including some for his own use. Facilitated by his financial adviser, he also operated a secret offshore financial haven, and in the latest, grubby instalment, played out some weeks ago before the Moriarty tribunal, ran up a IR\u00a31.1m unauthorised bank overdraft in the 70s, some of which was never paid off. Beneath Haughey, there appears to have been a legion of dishonest politicians and business leaders, many operating the same Cayman Island scheme to evade tax. </p> <p>Exactly how and why Ireland became the land of crooks and shirkers may puzzle us for decades. Much of it happened simply because, amid weak democratic structures and lazy press reporting, it could. But some of it must be put down to a peculiarly Irish distrust of structures of power, rules and regulations, always considered alien and Anglo-Saxon. </p> <p>The essential \"truth\" of Irish social interaction - ad hoc, unstructured, public house relations - was always liable to degrade into cronyism and graft: \"It was part of that kind of macho world where one could also tell your friends how you had drunk seven pints, driven home and evaded Garda checkpoints,\" says novelist Dermot Bolger. \"In the same way that drunken driving was publicly acceptable, tax evasion wasn't regarded as criminal.\" </p> <p>By far the most disturbing aspect of this corruption is the country's reluctance to punish any of the culprits. To date, none of the major protagonists has been imprisoned or even fined. After an abortive attempt to bring Haughey to trial, he still enjoys a luxurious lifestyle in his north Dublin mansion and on his own private island. Instead of being penalised, these disgraced figures of the past have simply crept back into the system and many have been the greatest beneficiaries of the boom. It is likely that we are now generating plenty of fresh material for the tribunals of the future. </p> <p>Now we're no longer down on our knees, <br>Our children don't have to seek work overseas <br>And so we can counsel these new refugees <br>Flooding into the country in twos and threes <br>Get back in line, can't you read the sign <br>No dogs or Bosnians please. </p> <p>On a social level, the boastfulness and bluster of the new Celtic Tiger ethos has not translated into an inclusive and open-minded national outlook, a real confidence that would reflect a people sure of their own abilities and able to respect the contributions of others. In fact, it appears to have triggered long-dormant prejudices, actively encouraging a nasty strain of unselfconscious xenophobia. </p> <p>The persistent railing against \"blacks\" that many of us have heard from friends and relatives, and the often naked aggression against foreigners on the streets of the capital, couldn't be more profoundly disappointing. Most of the hostility is directed against asylum-seekers, who have begun to arrive in significant but relatively small numbers - rising from 362 to 8,000 over the past six years: nine in 10 have experienced verbal abuse on the streets, according to one survey, and seven out of 10 had been refused services. </p> <p>The government this year launched a policy of dispersal, which basically dumps refugees in rural areas where they are isolated from support and aid groups, barred from working, given meals in B&amp;B or hostel conditions that they often cannot tolerate on religious grounds, and given just IR\u00a315 a week to live on. John McDermott of the Refugee Information Service, says: \"Opposition politicians are fond of saying that it is a shambles. But it's not a shambles if you are a racist. If you are a racist it all makes perfect sense.\" </p> <p>We've got democracy the Irish way, <br>With a referendum every day, <br>News update on the latest amendment, <br>You can have an abortion, as long as you're not pregnant. </p> <p>There can be little doubt that Ireland has made a giant leap towards becoming a secular state over the past decade: contraception is now freely available, limited divorce is finally on the statutes and the influence of the church largely destroyed by sex scandals in the early 90s. The country is now predominantly urban, with two-thirds of the population living in towns and cities, a negative image of the 30s and 40s, when De Valera forged his vision of a rural priest-ridden Catholic wonderland, populated by athletic farm-boys and comely maidens dancing at the crossroads. </p> <p>Yet, almost by sheer force of habit, much of the old order remains. This is still the only country in Europe to outlaw abortion, the only country in the world with this ban written into its constitution. In an act of collective moral doublethink, we continue to tolerate the fact that over 6,000 Irish women must travel every year to Britain for the operation, an alarmingly high percentage in late-term because of the lack of support and advice at home. </p> <p>And though, in the wake of the infamous X case in 1992, when the state attempted to prevent a 14-year-old rape victim from travelling to London for a termination, abortions have been allowed on a technicality when the life of the mother was in danger, a new referendum is currently being mooted to plug this loophole. </p> <p>A frantic Riverdancing nation, <br>Faint with self congratulation, <br>Where the only debate we'll ever condone, is <br>Will there be life after Boyzone? </p> <p>One of the more striking ironies of the Irish resurgence is that, as the new mythology rises up to displace the defunct rural, mud-hut primitive imagery of the past, Ireland has become far more efficient, in the cultural arena, at manufacturing and marketing the old stereotypes. The success of this strategy is reflected most spectacularly in the onward march of the Riverdance extravaganza, which has now moved ahead of U2 as Ireland's most lucrative cultural export. But the same dynamic is also evident in some more upmarket recent international successes, such as Martin McDonagh's Tony award-winning play The Beauty Queen of Leenane, and, to a lesser extent, Conor McPherson's The Weir, both of which peddle nostalgic and distorted aspects of Ireland and now appear even more hollow and untruthful. </p> <p>McDonagh's melodramatic oeuvre seems particularly symptomatic of a culture being driven by an outmoded and objectified self-image, its plots crammed with stage-Oirish creatures of mind-boggling artifice, and dialogue laced with sub-Synge idioms that could creditably pass for parody. </p> <p>For the audiences in London or New York who made successes of these plays, the west of Ireland shack settings and their logorrhaic muck-savage inhabitants appear impossibly exotic and elemental. When the works eventually return to Ireland, they are protected from any kind of vigorous criticism by a phalanx of awards and accolades. Overall, the dynamic is not unlike the one that has colonised downtown Dublin with fake Oirish pubs, whose emeraldy, signposty, plastic ambience proved such a huge hit in Helsinki and Manhattan that it was then re-imported back into Ireland, widely supplanting the authentic item that inspired them. </p> <p>Irish culture has been transformed into little more than a brand name, specifically and somewhat cynically engineered to appeal to foreign or expatriate perceptions, and then mistaken for the real thing when it arrives home. Product that doesn't match the ingredients listed on the label, such as Marina Carr's play, On Raftery's Hill, which brilliantly captured the spirit of a xenophobic, inward-looking nation, is simply discarded, playing to half-full houses at home and receiving cool reviews abroad. </p> <p>Ireland cannot really be like this. <br>One big theme Pub, the Pogue Mahone, <br>Where the rackrent landlords are all home grown, <br>There's a new pornography: property prices, <br>And the sexiest words are 'housing crisis.' <br>It's our own asylum, and so it will be, <br>In Eire 2016AD </p> <p>Despite the economic and material advances made over the past decade, and the revolution in employment opportunities, Ireland is failing to live up to the expectations generated by its own propaganda and its new status as one of Europe's more affluent nations. If the new wealth is viewed as a test of national character, it is one that we have failed quite abjectly, in our treatment of refugees and other races, in our ability to build and maintain adequate public and social services, in our ability to share the dividends with the poorer sectors of society. </p> <p>This adoptive self-image of a brash modern nation also fails to take account of the deeply conflicted nature of Irish society and alienates the majority who appear to be reaping meagre benefits. Truth for truth, and folly for folly, the idea of a technologically advanced, highly affluent Tiger nation striding boldly into the 21st century seems to be no more nor less accurate than any of the previous fictions that exerted such a grip on Irish identity, from the misty Celtic Twilight of Yeats to Dev's rosy rustic picture, each of which eventually led into a cultural and spiritual dead end. </p> <p>Ireland is given to illusory, indulgent images of itself.

      "bodyText": "Back in 1992, long before Ireland began its dizzying economic upward curve, a group of theatregoers huddled into Dublin's cramped Project theatre to witness The Emergency Session, an evening of hardcore Celtic gangsta-rap, presented by the country's most celebrated young company, Rough Magic. As the lights came down over thumping breakbeats, our MC, a hip-hop reincarnation of Ireland's first president and guiding spiritual father, Eamon de Valera, pimp-rolled onstage to the rhythm, spitting out the verses in that priestly county Limerick twang so familiar to the home audience. Numbers included Cead Mile Failte [100,000 welcomes], Bitch, an indictment of the Republic's treatment of women, and Neutral, More or Less, about Ireland's famed nudge-and-wink neutrality. However, the most memorable moment came with a tongue-in-cheek vision called Eire 2016AD, which conjured up a rosy picture of the state a century on from the uprising against British rule that led to its foundation: \"This country's really moving, the economy's improving,\" rapped MC Dev to incredulous guffaws, before following up with the queasy prediction: \"We all know how it's going to be, don't we? One big theme park, a quaint holiday, Unless you're female or homeless or gay. But we won't let reality get in the way, Here in theme park Ireland, Slainte, have a nice day...\" Returning to live in Ireland after almost 10 years away, I have often been struck by the eerie prescience of that show, a cassette of which I carried with me on my odyssey first to London and then to St Petersburg. What was then so preposterous that it barely made sense in the realm of satire has now miraculously become a reality. From a basket-case economy that ran up such debilitating international debt in the late 70s and 80s that the IMF seriously considered foreclosure in 1986, Ireland has been transformed into the mythical Celtic Tiger, a technological overachiever with double digit growth rates approaching three times the European average. Unemployment, which approached 20% in the 80s, is now down to 4%, and the debilitating, centuries-old emigration trend has been shunted into reverse. In the most startling development, Ireland is now the world's biggest exporter of computer software, nudging ahead of America for the first time last year. Entirely new stereotypes have displaced the downtrodden models of the past: \"Striding through the streets of Dublin these days,\" gushed Fortune magazine late last year, \"is an entirely new species of Irishman and Irishwoman: educated, optimistic and affluent - unaffected by the twin demons of poverty and despair that hounded their ancestors for the last several hundred years.\" And the Irish Times recently claimed: \"There is now a real surge of power in the Celtic psyche, where the Irish in the world are seen as models for business acumen, drive, ambition, political and social progress and achievements in the arenas of music, sport and literature.\" Yet despite the frothy rhetoric - which appears to have intoxicated most politicians - it is difficult to escape the sense that the Irish were still refusing to let \"reality get in the way\". Certainly the Dublin that greeted me was not the vibrant model capital of these congratulatory profiles, but largely the same scattered, grubby and vaguely planned provincial city I'd left 10 years ago, though now far more polluted and congested. House prices had gone up 300-500% and, as was obvious from the blankets and bundles in shop doorways across the city, homelessness had reached conspicuous, Thatcherite proportions, rising by 150% in the past year. Though there were considerably more jobs around, few people in my immediate circle were materially better off, and many felt the opposite. And the general mood among many commentators was far from celebratory: \"The economic boom has not really reflected itself on the basics of what people expect of living in a decent society,\" says author and columnist Fintan O'Toole, \"A lot of the impact has been negative, in that it is much more difficult to buy a house, to travel around the capital, and to access a lot of basic services.\" Far from being a nation finally at peace with itself and comfortable with its new-found affluence, Celtic Tiger Ireland seems increasingly fraught with contradictions. Few economists or politicians predicted this and, consequently, even fewer have any idea of what course it will take in the future. It is also an economic recovery that happened almost entirely independently of the Irish business elite, who had conspicuously failed for decades to lift the country out of terminal depression. The Celtic Tiger was essentially created not by the Irish but by American hi-tech multinationals, eager to find a convenient launch-pad into Europe and attracted to Ireland by its educated and moderately rewarded workforce, Euro-friendly orientation, and crucially, by its rock-bottom 10% rate of corporate tax (compared to 40% in Germany and over 30% in Britain). Put bluntly: \"It was based on criminally low taxation rates to attract foreign industry,\" says writer and journalist John Waters. \" In effect, Ireland became a laundering operation for multinational industry in order to avoid tax.\" By the mid-90s, this was beginning to bear fruit: $7bn direct investment in 1997 alone. The impact has been most beneficially felt in the employment market. Jobs have become so freely available that Ireland, once Europe's greatest exporter of humanity, has now begun to run out of people - every shop or restaurant window in Dublin now displays \"help wanted\" notices, computer programmers are recruited en masse from Russia and navvies shipped in from London. Meanwhile, wages for the majority of the Irish inhabitants have been kept artificially low by a \"social partnership\" agreement and still weigh in at just 80% of the European average. Corruption is now ancient history There were no convictions (obviously) Well, different standards applied at the time, We didn't know taking a bribe was a crime, It used to be called a consultancy fee Way back in 2015AD. No other single factor has done quite so much to undermine the inflated rhetoric of the boom than the constant revelations flowing from tribunals set up to investigate massive wrongdoing by the political and business elite in the 70s, 80s and early 90s. Irish politics is now not merely tainted by corruption, but characterised by it. The definitive Irish sleaze bible is an engrossing little tome entitled This Great Little Nation: the A-Z of Irish Scandals and Controversies. It was written by Gene Kerrigan and Pat Brennan, and runs to over 300 pages of epic wrongdoing in the beef industry, a little priestly paedophilia, land re-zoning scams, bribe-taking, party political cronyism and a massive banking tax evasion scheme. At the centre of the vast web of political scandal is Charles Haughey, the country's taoiseach - prime minister - throughout much of the 80s and early 90s. It transpires that Haughey supported a lavish lifestyle by soliciting \"donations\" from businessmen totalling some IR\u00a38m, and misdirected party funds, including some for his own use. Facilitated by his financial adviser, he also operated a secret offshore financial haven, and in the latest, grubby instalment, played out some weeks ago before the Moriarty tribunal, ran up a IR\u00a31.1m unauthorised bank overdraft in the 70s, some of which was never paid off. Beneath Haughey, there appears to have been a legion of dishonest politicians and business leaders, many operating the same Cayman Island scheme to evade tax. Exactly how and why Ireland became the land of crooks and shirkers may puzzle us for decades. Much of it happened simply because, amid weak democratic structures and lazy press reporting, it could. But some of it must be put down to a peculiarly Irish distrust of structures of power, rules and regulations, always considered alien and Anglo-Saxon. The essential \"truth\" of Irish social interaction - ad hoc, unstructured, public house relations - was always liable to degrade into cronyism and graft: \"It was part of that kind of macho world where one could also tell your friends how you had drunk seven pints, driven home and evaded Garda checkpoints,\" says novelist Dermot Bolger. \"In the same way that drunken driving was publicly acceptable, tax evasion wasn't regarded as criminal.\" By far the most disturbing aspect of this corruption is the country's reluctance to punish any of the culprits. To date, none of the major protagonists has been imprisoned or even fined. After an abortive attempt to bring Haughey to trial, he still enjoys a luxurious lifestyle in his north Dublin mansion and on his own private island. Instead of being penalised, these disgraced figures of the past have simply crept back into the system and many have been the greatest beneficiaries of the boom. It is likely that we are now generating plenty of fresh material for the tribunals of the future. Now we're no longer down on our knees, Our children don't have to seek work overseas And so we can counsel these new refugees Flooding into the country in twos and threes Get back in line, can't you read the sign No dogs or Bosnians please. On a social level, the boastfulness and bluster of the new Celtic Tiger ethos has not translated into an inclusive and open-minded national outlook, a real confidence that would reflect a people sure of their own abilities and able to respect the contributions of others. In fact, it appears to have triggered long-dormant prejudices, actively encouraging a nasty strain of unselfconscious xenophobia. The persistent railing against \"blacks\" that many of us have heard from friends and relatives, and the often naked aggression against foreigners on the streets of the capital, couldn't be more profoundly disappointing. Most of the hostility is directed against asylum-seekers, who have begun to arrive in significant but relatively small numbers - rising from 362 to 8,000 over the past six years: nine in 10 have experienced verbal abuse on the streets, according to one survey, and seven out of 10 had been refused services. The government this year launched a policy of dispersal, which basically dumps refugees in rural areas where they are isolated from support and aid groups, barred from working, given meals in B&amp;B or hostel conditions that they often cannot tolerate on religious grounds, and given just IR\u00a315 a week to live on. John McDermott of the Refugee Information Service, says: \"Opposition politicians are fond of saying that it is a shambles. But it's not a shambles if you are a racist. If you are a racist it all makes perfect sense.\" We've got democracy the Irish way, With a referendum every day, News update on the latest amendment, You can have an abortion, as long as you're not pregnant. There can be little doubt that Ireland has made a giant leap towards becoming a secular state over the past decade: contraception is now freely available, limited divorce is finally on the statutes and the influence of the church largely destroyed by sex scandals in the early 90s. The country is now predominantly urban, with two-thirds of the population living in towns and cities, a negative image of the 30s and 40s, when De Valera forged his vision of a rural priest-ridden Catholic wonderland, populated by athletic farm-boys and comely maidens dancing at the crossroads. Yet, almost by sheer force of habit, much of the old order remains. This is still the only country in Europe to outlaw abortion, the only country in the world with this ban written into its constitution. In an act of collective moral doublethink, we continue to tolerate the fact that over 6,000 Irish women must travel every year to Britain for the operation, an alarmingly high percentage in late-term because of the lack of support and advice at home. And though, in the wake of the infamous X case in 1992, when the state attempted to prevent a 14-year-old rape victim from travelling to London for a termination, abortions have been allowed on a technicality when the life of the mother was in danger, a new referendum is currently being mooted to plug this loophole. A frantic Riverdancing nation, Faint with self congratulation, Where the only debate we'll ever condone, is Will there be life after Boyzone? One of the more striking ironies of the Irish resurgence is that, as the new mythology rises up to displace the defunct rural, mud-hut primitive imagery of the past, Ireland has become far more efficient, in the cultural arena, at manufacturing and marketing the old stereotypes. The success of this strategy is reflected most spectacularly in the onward march of the Riverdance extravaganza, which has now moved ahead of U2 as Ireland's most lucrative cultural export. But the same dynamic is also evident in some more upmarket recent international successes, such as Martin McDonagh's Tony award-winning play The Beauty Queen of Leenane, and, to a lesser extent, Conor McPherson's The Weir, both of which peddle nostalgic and distorted aspects of Ireland and now appear even more hollow and untruthful. McDonagh's melodramatic oeuvre seems particularly symptomatic of a culture being driven by an outmoded and objectified self-image, its plots crammed with stage-Oirish creatures of mind-boggling artifice, and dialogue laced with sub-Synge idioms that could creditably pass for parody. For the audiences in London or New York who made successes of these plays, the west of Ireland shack settings and their logorrhaic muck-savage inhabitants appear impossibly exotic and elemental. When the works eventually return to Ireland, they are protected from any kind of vigorous criticism by a phalanx of awards and accolades. Overall, the dynamic is not unlike the one that has colonised downtown Dublin with fake Oirish pubs, whose emeraldy, signposty, plastic ambience proved such a huge hit in Helsinki and Manhattan that it was then re-imported back into Ireland, widely supplanting the authentic item that inspired them. Irish culture has been transformed into little more than a brand name, specifically and somewhat cynically engineered to appeal to foreign or expatriate perceptions, and then mistaken for the real thing when it arrives home. Product that doesn't match the ingredients listed on the label, such as Marina Carr's play, On Raftery's Hill, which brilliantly captured the spirit of a xenophobic, inward-looking nation, is simply discarded, playing to half-full houses at home and receiving cool reviews abroad. Ireland cannot really be like this. One big theme Pub, the Pogue Mahone, Where the rackrent landlords are all home grown, There's a new pornography: property prices, And the sexiest words are 'housing crisis.' It's our own asylum, and so it will be, In Eire 2016AD Despite the economic and material advances made over the past decade, and the revolution in employment opportunities, Ireland is failing to live up to the expectations generated by its own propaganda and its new status as one of Europe's more affluent nations. If the new wealth is viewed as a test of national character, it is one that we have failed quite abjectly, in our treatment of refugees and other races, in our ability to build and maintain adequate public and social services, in our ability to share the dividends with the poorer sectors of society. This adoptive self-image of a brash modern nation also fails to take account of the deeply conflicted nature of Irish society and alienates the majority who appear to be reaping meagre benefits. Truth for truth, and folly for folly, the idea of a technologically advanced, highly affluent Tiger nation striding boldly into the 21st century seems to be no more nor less accurate than any of the previous fictions that exerted such a grip on Irish identity, from the misty Celtic Twilight of Yeats to Dev's rosy rustic picture, each of which eventually led into a cultural and spiritual dead end. Ireland is given to illusory, indulgent images of itself. With the latest Celtic Tiger variant, all it has managed to do is modernise its self-delusion. What Eire really looks like in 2016AD depends on decisions taken right now. With extra cash surging through the system, there is for the first time a chance to cut through these prevailing fictions and build a society on well-funded social principles. However, we seem more intent on using further tax cuts to prolong the party, letting us bask a little longer in the glow of the superheated economy. All the indications suggest that we will be gazing back from MC Dev's watershed centennial year, fondly recalling the frenzy of the Celtic Tiger boom years and perhaps lamenting the missed opportunity to transform Ireland into a modern, egalitarian, inclusive as well as affluent country. \u0095 Verses by Arthur Riordan",

Such a room demands concentration: it would hold you prisoner to its potential, so that it would feel quite wrong to attempt an escape and lunge at the digestives in the kitchen drawer for the fourth time that morning. But a workspace such as this would be unrealistic for me. I would soon spill coffee over the creamy wood. Perhaps it would be better to have somewhere just as light and breezy.

      "body": "<p>I am pleased to announce the merger of Morrisons and Waitrose. Alas, this is only for the purposes of this column, and not a hair-raising commercial reality. It is, however, amusing to imagine the lone wine-buying hero at Morrisons, Mr Stuart Purdie, contemplating the \u00a350-quid bottles at Waitrose Direct, just as it is entertaining to contemplate Mr Julian Brind and his platoon of fellow Masters Of Wine in the Waitrose wine-buying department marching down the Morrison aisles and noting the plenitude of cheapies. However, the gulf between Morrison and Waitrose is not as large as this fanciful scenario might suggest. </p> <p>We shall begin with those Morrisons aisles and these resident cheapies. La Chasse du Pape R\u00e9serve C\u00f4tes du Rh\u00f4ne 1998 is a country bumpkin with a city slicker's polish, thus it delivers decisively dry, rip-roaring, herby fruit with a suggestion of urban chic. It rates 16 points (out of 20) and costs \u00a34.99. The 1998 vintage of Dom Ferraz Dao is also \u00a34.99, and worth every escudo. It, too, exhibits a rich herbiness and even more dramatic tannins. The wine lingers, it loves food, and is a treat for the tastebuds. And it also rates 16 points. </p> <p>Of all the ranges of wine at supermarkets, none was launched with more overall consistency or remarkable value-for-money fruit than Morrison's Falcon Ridge collection, made for the store by the enterprising Australian Michael Goundrey near Narbonne. Falcon Ridge Cabernet Sauvignon Vin de Pays d'Oc 1999 (16 points, \u00a33.49) has hugely arresting blackcurrant richness and sufficient character and bite to make it versatile with food. Falcon Ridge Syrah Vin de Pays d'Oc 1999 (15.5 points, \u00a33.49) offers lovely, tangy richness and plump ripeness, and parades a joyousness finish. Falcon Ridge Merlot Vin de Pays d'Oc 1999 (15 points, \u00a33.49) is ripe, rich, and a touch raucous, but with a price so mellow that it is no problem to swallow. One is compelled to wonder just what Aussie techniques Mr Goundrey is employing to get such fruit from his farmers (and what Mr Purdie does to achieve such prices). </p> <p>And last at Morrison's, a bargain from Spain. Conforrales Tinto Cencibel 1998 is a pert little performer, with excellent acids, and fairly lush tannins that yield a dry, charcoal edge of some charm. A solid quaffing companion and food wine, it rates 15 points and costs \u00a33.49. </p> <p>At Waitrose, let me open with an interesting Italian organic red. Terra Viva Merlot del Veneto 1999 is very dry, 14-point fruity, and reasonably well compacted, and it has been reduced to a special-offer price of \u00a33.99 until September 3. The modesty of its fruit, when sipping, belies its excellence with food.</p> <p>Houghton HWB 1998 (16 points, on offer at \u00a34.99 until September 3) used to label itself Houghton White Burgundy, until the French chased that pretension away. However, though the grapes in HWB are not burgundian (ie, chardonnay) the wine does have an eerie echo of a smoothly vegetal burgundy - except, of course, it is Australian and so more gripping than anything Burgundy can remotely do for the same money. Waitrose has also reduced the price of Penfolds Koonunga Hill Chardonnay 1999 to \u00a34.99 until September 3. Rating 16 points, this vintage is crisp, clean, classy.</p> <p>The Australian Tatachilla Sauvignon/Semillon 1999 (15 points, \u00a34.49, also until September 3) is also in fine fettle, very cool and collected, and most untypically subtle. Lugana Villa Flora 1999 (16 points, \u00a33.99 until September 3), from Italy, has utterly lovely compressed gooseberries, pears and melon (under-ripe) with a hints of spice and a wonderful clean, crisp finish. This is an astounding bargain at this price, and I ll be shelling out my own money for some. </p> <p>As I have done in the past for Warwick Estate Chardonnay 1999, from the Cape. Is this the best-value chardonnay in the world? It has lovely creamy woodiness, alert acids underpinning good melon/vegetal fruit and it'll get more like Montrachet as it ages over the next five years. It rates 17.5 points and costs \u00a36.99 in assorted London stores or nationally via mail order, 0800 188881.</p>",

Of all the ranges of wine at supermarkets, none was launched with more overall consistency or remarkable value-for-money fruit than Morrison's Falcon Ridge collection, made for the store by the enterprising Australian Michael Goundrey near Narbonne. Falcon Ridge Cabernet Sauvignon Vin de Pays d'Oc 1999 (16 points, \u00a33.49) has hugely arresting blackcurrant richness and sufficient character and bite to make it versatile with food. Falcon Ridge Syrah Vin de Pays d'Oc 1999 (15.5 points, \u00a33.49) offers lovely, tangy richness and plump ripeness, and parades a joyousness finish. Falcon Ridge Merlot Vin de Pays d'Oc 1999 (15 points, \u00a33.49) is ripe, rich, and a touch raucous, but with a price so mellow that it is no problem to swallow. One is compelled to wonder just what Aussie techniques Mr Goundrey is employing to get such fruit from his farmers (and what Mr Purdie does to achieve such prices). And last at Morrison's, a bargain from Spain. Conforrales Tinto Cencibel 1998 is a pert little performer, with excellent acids, and fairly lush tannins that yield a dry, charcoal edge of some charm. A solid quaffing companion and food wine, it rates 15 points and costs \u00a33.49. At Waitrose, let me open with an interesting Italian organic red. Terra Viva Merlot del Veneto 1999 is very dry, 14-point fruity, and reasonably well compacted, and it has been reduced to a special-offer price of \u00a33.99 until September 3. The modesty of its fruit, when sipping, belies its excellence with food. Houghton HWB 1998 (16 points, on offer at \u00a34.99 until September 3) used to label itself Houghton White Burgundy, until the French chased that pretension away. However, though the grapes in HWB are not burgundian (ie, chardonnay) the wine does have an eerie echo of a smoothly vegetal burgundy - except, of course, it is Australian and so more gripping than anything Burgundy can remotely do for the same money. Waitrose has also reduced the price of Penfolds Koonunga Hill Chardonnay 1999 to \u00a34.99 until September 3. Rating 16 points, this vintage is crisp, clean, classy. The Australian Tatachilla Sauvignon/Semillon 1999 (15 points, \u00a34.49, also until September 3) is also in fine fettle, very cool and collected, and most untypically subtle. Lugana Villa Flora 1999 (16 points, \u00a33.99 until September 3), from Italy, has utterly lovely compressed gooseberries, pears and melon (under-ripe) with a hints of spice and a wonderful clean, crisp finish. This is an astounding bargain at this price, and I ll be shelling out my own money for some. As I have done in the past for Warwick Estate Chardonnay 1999, from the Cape. Is this the best-value chardonnay in the world? It has lovely creamy woodiness, alert acids underpinning good melon/vegetal fruit and it'll get more like Montrachet as it ages over the next five years. It rates 17.5 points and costs \u00a36.99 in assorted London stores or nationally via mail order, 0800 188881.",

      "body": "<p>The Guardian-sponsored Camra Champion Bottled Beer of Britain competition broke new ground this year at the Great British Beer festival at London Olympia - the judges chose a beer from a brewery that had just closed down. Thankfully, the beer will live on: it is moving to a new brewery, ready for a relaunch this autumn.</p> <p>The beer in question is that classic India pale ale, Worthington White Shield, one of the great 19th-century Burton-brewed beers that carved out a new market for British brewers in the colonies. First brewed by William Worthington, it became a Bass beer in the 20s when the two Burton companies merged. For years it was a small but much-loved brand in the Bass portfolio, but when Bass became a mass-market leisure group in the 80s and 90s, White Shield, which was painstakingly made with live yeast in the bottle and best drunk after a month or two of conditioning, became a nuisance. So it was kicked out of Burton, sent to subsidiaries in Sheffield and then Birmingham, before, in 1998, being handed over to independent brewer, King &amp; Barnes.</p> <p>Earlier this year, King &amp; Barnes, a victim of the war of attrition in the brewing industry, was taken over by Hall &amp; Woodhouse of Blandford, Dorset, which was keen to get its hands on the Horsham company's 57 pubs but had no interest in the brewery. So it was earmarked for closure, and Worthington White Shield was once again looking for a home. It found it, back in its hometown, Burton-on-Trent: Bass, which is now part of Belgian giant Interbrew, allows brewer Steve Wellington to make it in the small pilot brewery that is part of the Bass Museum. Wellington, using plant that can produce just 60 barrels a week, has already lovingly recreated such lost Bass beers as No 1 Barley Wine, and is now rubbing his yeasty hands at the thought of turning White Shield into a proper Burton pale ale once more.</p> <p>So, the Guardian readers who volunteered to judge the championship have given a vital boost to a beer that has suffered more than its fair share of misfortune - and before you cry \"fix\", it must be stressed that they had no idea what they were drinking. White Shield was picked after a blind tasting of eight bottle-fermented beers, decanted into anonymous jugs and poured into half-pint glasses enigmatically labelled from K to R. The panel was made up of readers Wendy Conian, David Elworthy, Carl Flint, Simon Freytag, Rosanna Santagata and Alan Southgate, along with Guardian food and drink editor, Matthew Fort, Jeff Evans, the author of the Good Bottled Beer Guide, Kathy Hadfield from Camra's national executive, and myself.</p> <p>Beer K had a luscious copper-red hue, and conjured up such conflicting descriptions as \"wet hop sacks\" (Kathy), \"harsh finish\" (Alan and Jeff), \"cat-litter aroma\" (Matthew), \"subtle\" (Rosanna), and \"a good finish, yeasty and bitter\" (Wendy). L was an attractive copper colour that delivered fruity aromas and flavours to several of the judges. Rosanna found lime, Kathy and Simon pears or pear drops, and David apples. Wendy found it too fruity: \"It leaves the insides of my cheeks furry.\" All agreed it had a disappointing finish and was too sweet.</p> <p>The straw-coloured M brought forth the most memorable comment of the championship from Wendy - she said that it smelled like \"folk-festival farts\", and we all bowed to her expertise in this area, seeing as she had spent the previous weekend at the Cambridge Folk Festival. Warming to the theme, Kathy found the aroma reminiscent of wet tents. Jeff found it to be chewy and wheaty, while several judges pondered whether it might be a wheat beer. David said it reminded him of \"lime cordial with too much water\".</p> <p>Beer N was even paler than M. Kathy sniffed and said \"Wow - peaches and pineapple!\" After much deliberation, we agreed that, while it had a fine aroma, there was little finish. O was red-brown in colour and was praised by Wendy for its \"mellow fruitfulness\" - clearly an autumnal ale. Jeff detected Marmite on the nose, Kathy found digestive biscuits, Rosanna thought it salty, Matthew praised its \"crisp and delicious drinkability\", David said it reminded him of barley fields, Alan thought it rounded, and Carl brought us down to earth with the blunt, almost Orwellian comment that it was \"like a Sunday afternoon when the smell of beer comes out of a pub and that's what you want\".</p> <p>We were bowled over by the delightful copper colour of beer P. Rosanna and I both cried \"pear drops\" as we sniffed, while Wendy found it \"wonderfully bitter\" and Jeff \"very moreish\". Kathy criticised it for being too strong, with too much alcohol, while Matthew thought it too well-behaved. Q was a more burnished copper colour and brought forth such superlatives as \"fresh strawberries\" (Kathy), \"old smokestacks\" (Simon) and \"dark bitter chocolate\" (Wendy). Matthew thought it so fruity that it needed to be drunk with food, which launched a short debate on just what dish it should accompany. Sea bass, said some , while I suggested the Czech tradition of drinking a darkish beer with carp. Then we were into the home straight with beer R, a pale, golden amber in colour. Rosanna and David were not impressed, saying it smelled like Domestos, but others were wild about the aroma that reminded them of grapefruit, passion fruit, mangoes, and lychees.</p> <p>We marked each beer out of 10 for appearance, aroma, taste and finish. When the marks were totted up and the names of the beers revealed, the winner was P, the aforementioned Worthington White Shield, with Hampshire Brewery's Pride of Romsey IPA (R) second and another King &amp; Barnes brew, Festive (O), in third place. Runners-up were Fuller's 1845 (K), Young's Special London Ale (L), Hop Back Summer Lightning (M), B&amp;T Dragonslayer (N), and Gale's Prize Old Ale (Q). A remarkable victory for the dented White Shield, and long may it flourish back in its natal town of Burton-on-Trent.</p> <p>\u0095 King &amp; Barnes' Worthington White Shield is available in Tesco and Unwins while stocks last.</p>",

So, the Guardian readers who volunteered to judge the championship have given a vital boost to a beer that has suffered more than its fair share of misfortune - and before you cry \"fix\", it must be stressed that they had no idea what they were drinking. White Shield was picked after a blind tasting of eight bottle-fermented beers, decanted into anonymous jugs and poured into half-pint glasses enigmatically labelled from K to R. The panel was made up of readers Wendy Conian, David Elworthy, Carl Flint, Simon Freytag, Rosanna Santagata and Alan Southgate, along with Guardian food and drink editor, Matthew Fort, Jeff Evans, the author of the Good Bottled Beer Guide, Kathy Hadfield from Camra's national executive, and myself. Beer K had a luscious copper-red hue, and conjured up such conflicting descriptions as \"wet hop sacks\" (Kathy), \"harsh finish\" (Alan and Jeff), \"cat-litter aroma\" (Matthew), \"subtle\" (Rosanna), and \"a good finish, yeasty and bitter\" (Wendy). L was an attractive copper colour that delivered fruity aromas and flavours to several of the judges. Rosanna found lime, Kathy and Simon pears or pear drops, and David apples. Wendy found it too fruity: \"It leaves the insides of my cheeks furry.\" All agreed it had a disappointing finish and was too sweet. The straw-coloured M brought forth the most memorable comment of the championship from Wendy - she said that it smelled like \"folk-festival farts\", and we all bowed to her expertise in this area, seeing as she had spent the previous weekend at the Cambridge Folk Festival. Warming to the theme, Kathy found the aroma reminiscent of wet tents. Jeff found it to be chewy and wheaty, while several judges pondered whether it might be a wheat beer. David said it reminded him of \"lime cordial with too much water\". Beer N was even paler than M. Kathy sniffed and said \"Wow - peaches and pineapple!\" After much deliberation, we agreed that, while it had a fine aroma, there was little finish. O was red-brown in colour and was praised by Wendy for its \"mellow fruitfulness\" - clearly an autumnal ale. Jeff detected Marmite on the nose, Kathy found digestive biscuits, Rosanna thought it salty, Matthew praised its \"crisp and delicious drinkability\", David said it reminded him of barley fields, Alan thought it rounded, and Carl brought us down to earth with the blunt, almost Orwellian comment that it was \"like a Sunday afternoon when the smell of beer comes out of a pub and that's what you want\". We were bowled over by the delightful copper colour of beer P. Rosanna and I both cried \"pear drops\" as we sniffed, while Wendy found it \"wonderfully bitter\" and Jeff \"very moreish\". Kathy criticised it for being too strong, with too much alcohol, while Matthew thought it too well-behaved. Q was a more burnished copper colour and brought forth such superlatives as \"fresh strawberries\" (Kathy), \"old smokestacks\" (Simon) and \"dark bitter chocolate\" (Wendy). Matthew thought it so fruity that it needed to be drunk with food, which launched a short debate on just what dish it should accompany. Sea bass, said some , while I suggested the Czech tradition of drinking a darkish beer with carp. Then we were into the home straight with beer R, a pale, golden amber in colour. Rosanna and David were not impressed, saying it smelled like Domestos, but others were wild about the aroma that reminded them of grapefruit, passion fruit, mangoes, and lychees. We marked each beer out of 10 for appearance, aroma, taste and finish. When the marks were totted up and the names of the beers revealed, the winner was P, the aforementioned Worthington White Shield, with Hampshire Brewery's Pride of Romsey IPA (R) second and another King &amp; Barnes brew, Festive (O), in third place. Runners-up were Fuller's 1845 (K), Young's Special London Ale (L), Hop Back Summer Lightning (M), B&amp;T Dragonslayer (N), and Gale's Prize Old Ale (Q). A remarkable victory for the dented White Shield, and long may it flourish back in its natal town of Burton-on-Trent. \u0095 King &amp; Barnes' Worthington White Shield is available in Tesco and Unwins while stocks last.",

      "body": "<p>Lord Winston is ebullient. His arms are waving around. His body leans over the table for emphasis, throws itself back in a moment of assumed thoughtfulness, then bends forward again. A wilted yellow rose bobs up and down in his lapel, as if even it agrees with him. Of course it would. He is talking about the one thing for which he is so very well known and in which he is so very well versed - IVF treatment. </p> <p>But this afternoon's conversation has taken an unexpected turn. The professor of fertility studies is questioning his own creed: \"We are obsessed with IVF,\" he says. \"People are going through IVF who certainly don't need it.\" It's as if the Pope had declared that there was too much Catholicism about. Or, as Lord Winston is an orthodox Jew, the chief Rabbi had decided that an excess of young people were being barmitzvahed. </p> <p>But the undermining of his own beliefs doesn't stop there. I had told this eminent babymaker that, just an hour before meeting him, I had an embryo transfer - two eight-cell embryos replaced in my womb. I was halfway through an IVF cycle myself. </p> <p>\"You don't need IVF,\" he states, and I note that even the wilted rose nods in agreement. \"I don't want to personalise this, but I could argue that you're undergoing an experiment which is totally useless. We've become increasingly focused on this form of conception, so everyone thinks they really need IVF when the evidence for that need is not that good.\" </p> <p>Well. Where can I start? Let me at first explain my predicament. I did not particularly intend to meet Lord Winston of Hammersmith, professor of fertility studies at Imperial College School of Medicine, consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist, and director of Europe's largest reproductive medicine department, on such an auspicious day. His schedule is so busy that he arranges meetings between meetings, presumably in the hope that one will finish early and another a little late. He obviously enjoys being courted, and finds it difficult to refuse an invitation. \"I don't do anything very well these days,\" he says. \"You laugh, but it's true. [I hadn't laughed.] I do too many things, all superficial. It's a big problem.\" </p> <p>We met at the House of Lords, where he has been a Labour Life Peer since 1995, and where he chairs the Science and Technology Committee and gladly and charmingly hobnobs. As we walk to the bar, his arm appeared to be permanently half-extended, his hand open and ready to be shaken. He strolls easily past the great, good and ever-so conversationally interesting - Ruth Rendell, John Birt, Waheed Alli, David Puttnam. He clearly thinks he belongs here. </p> <p>It just so happened that this sought-after man's only free moment all but clashed with my embryo transfer. So, instead of the recommended day of bed-rest, I disentangled myself from the stirrups, rose from my hospital bed and walked to my meeting with the Lord of Fertility. I must confess, I wasn't entirely reluctant to do so. It seemed a good omen. Childless couples turn to him as if to a saviour. Lord Winston won't only cure their condition, he will make their lives whole. He's believed to carry countless future families in his little Petri dishes. Just an appointment with him is seen as getting halfway to conception. \"I'm nervous of him and I don't know why,\" said one woman as she entered his clinic in the 1996 documentary series, Making Babies. \"It's because you think he's God,\" said her husband. \"He is to me,\" she replied. If there were a Prayer for the Infertile, it would be, \"Oh Lord Winston, please grant us a child\". Just to be in his presence on the day of my transfer must surely be a blessing. </p> <p>Although I had promised myself otherwise, within moments I'd told him where I'd just come from. He insisted I had a tumbler of red wine. \"Not white,\" he said with authority. \"But red. It will be good for your intrauterine conditions.\" In my bag, alongside the folic acid, I had leaflets warning of the dangers of alcohol and how it threatened fertility. And here, sitting opposite me, was the man with a reputation for conjuring up babies like a magician does rabbits. It was clear whom I should believe in. I began to sip my red wine. </p> <p>The Lord had his usual, a malt whisky. I wondered what bit of the body that was good for. The brain, perhaps, judging by 60-year-old Robert Maurice Lipson Winston's impressive CV. There is hardly a country that has not honoured him - from visiting professor at the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium to honorary member of a fertility society in Chile. Twenty years ago, he founded the first NHS IVF programme. Since then, he has used every means possible to promulgate support for the infertile, exploiting every media. His groundbreaking Making Babies documentary introduced us to the promise of IVF; before that, infertility was only some other poor and pitiable person's problem. It is his clinic at Hammersmith that has taken on women who have failed or been refused IVF everywhere else. Last summer, he was still calling it the \"last port of call\" for such desperate patients. He is the oracle on half a million women's ovaries. </p> <p>So his unexpected words to me that afternoon in the House of Lords bar carried particular weight. \"The trouble with in vitro fertilisation is that it's a wonderful money-spinner. It's a brilliant diversion from what's really the matter. It's jolly easy to do, because you can mechanise it. You can just thread people through a programme and you don't need to think. Most women going through IVF are actually effectively going through a mill.\" To bolster myself while listening to this tirade, I take another sip of red wine. It seems the Lord is losing his faith. \"IVF isn't a treatment for infertility. It's a way of getting pregnant on a one-shot basis. It's quite different. It's what you're going through.\" </p> <p>Oh no, I was waiting for that. I should have left myself out of it. My chromosomes, rather than my character, are of more than a little interest to most fertility experts. I have a chromosomal disorder called a translocation, and was having not your common-or-garden IVF but pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), to sort my good embryos from bad. </p> <p> <strong> </strong> Winston pioneered PGD. But he uncharacteristically says he doesn't want to talk about that. \"I can't talk to you honestly at this time, because you're vulnerable,\" he says. I insist I am not. The medicine man knows better. \"I'm a doctor, I see people like you, I see a lot.\" Realising that this line of conversation may be good for the bedside but not the barside, he quickly retreats to the non-specific. \"There is a need for a much more holistic approach. We're not treating infertile people any more. We're not actually treating the causes of their infertility. For example . . .\" He's in full animated flow now, bending backwards and forwards. \"We could do far more research into looking into why embryos don't implant. There's very, very little research going on. Chances are that doesn't need IVF at all. What that probably needs is better understanding of the genetic messages in the uterus and correcting those genetic messages by tailor-made drugs . . . </p> <p>\"I've not changed my views,\" he insists. \"My research has changed.\" </p> <p>Well. Shall I start again, at the beginning? A young Robert Winston, a graduate of London University, established his reputation as a fine and dextrous surgeon in the 70s. His breakthrough was in the field of tubal microsurgery. By improving techniques, he was able to unblock fallopian tubes and dramatically increase a woman's chance of getting pregnant. Half of his patients conceived within five months. In 1984, he delivered test-tube quads. His team developed tests to screen embryos for sex-linked diseases such as muscular dystrophy, gene defects such as cystic fibrosis and chromosome disorders. In 1995, they achieved the first ever pregnancy after testing embryos for a chromosome translocation like mine. Yet already he has changed his mind about that, too. He feels my hopes have been falsely raised. Now his clinic, once the only place you could go, rarely offers such screening. </p> <p>It isn't the first time that Lord Winston has made an about turn. In 1993, he attacked the treatment of women aged over 50 as \"misplaced use of technology\", declaring 39 his upper age limit. A year later, that had shifted to 60. When Dolly the sheep was cloned, he wrote vociferously that the cloning of human tissue was never going to happen. Now it is the focus of his research. In a New Statesman interview this January, where he famously said that Britain's funding of its health service was \"not as good as Poland's\", he clearly attacked the Government's health record. \"There is a lot wrong with the health service and no one is prepared to say so . . . we've been quite deceitful about it. We haven't told the truth and I'm afraid there will come a time when it will be impossible to disguise the inequality of the health service from the general population.\" Yet even before the interview was published, he was backtracking. \"I believe that the basic direction of NHS policy is right under this Government . . . I did not mean, and I wish to stress this, that the Government are deceiving people over the NHS.\" </p> <p>There is at least one thing he hasn't changed his mind on. He is a passionate believer in a national health service, if not ours. At present, around 10% of IVF is NHS-funded, \"the worst in Europe\", says Winston. \"There's not nearly enough IVF on the NHS. It's grossly under-funded.\" This excludes patients who can't afford the treatment cost of around \u00a32,000, and encourages sloppiness and bad practice. \"The NHS is a way of ensuring decent, proper values. At the 80 or 90 private IVF clinics around the country, you'll have no idea what happens to your embryos after they weren't transferred. You'll have no access to detailed hormonal investigation when the thing goes wrong.\" </p> <p> He believes that the government body responsible for regulating and licensing IVF and PGD, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), is powerless to improve private practice. \"The HFEA can't go to a private clinic and say you will have this kind of audit. All it can do is ensure that people have the absolute modicum of basic treatment, in clean laboratories, which are not contaminated, where there's reasonable record-keeping and so on. Basic things.\" </p> <p>He is not a fan of the HFEA, with its strict licensing procedures for PGD and embryo research. He calls it \"an irritation\". \"I'm not convinced that this is an area of medicine which should be regulated much more strictly than other areas, more than tubal or heart surgery. You inhibit research that needs to be done.\" Unsurprisingly, the HFEA has shunned him. \"I wouldn't join them if I was asked,\" he responds petulantly, before adding, \"but I don't want to talk about that. I don't want to talk about that,\" waving his hands about. </p> <p>Winston has been caught out blabbering before. He indiscreetly gave away that Cherie Blair was apparently going for a Caesarean birth. Predictably, he denied ever having said it, leading to the playing of his fuzzy, taped confession on Radio 4's The World At One. He is well in with New Labour; Blair was a guest on his This Is Your Life. After the New Statesman attack on the NHS, he confidently announced that he expected to be \"able to talk to people in Downing Street in the next week or two\". He clearly believes that the recent \u00a319 billion injection of cash is a good deal due to him. \"The fact that I said the health service needed more money, I'd have to be pretty bloody stupid to believe that it was my doing that we got big money. But _ perhaps what that particular event did was to just highlight the problem.\" </p> <p>He doesn't underestimate his influence. \"Your Life In Their Hands was immensely successful. It was the second-most watched programme ever on BBC2,\" he reminds me about the 80s series he presented. \"It may turn out that the Human Body is the most important thing I've ever done, more important than the 300 publications I've got in various journals, including the one in Nature. It may be more important than the invention of PGD.\" </p> <p>And with such dexterity - the same dexterity for which he was once famed in the operating theatre - he has reminded me that, without Winston, I wouldn't even be there with my hour-old embryo transfer. I have him to thank. He would also like to remind me that last year the Royal Society awarded him the Faraday prize for \"the furtherance of the public understanding of science\". Any modesty is certainly mock. But there is a crack in his super confidence. He describes his forthcoming six-part BBC series, Superhuman, which predictably examines genetics, as \"a disaster. I'd rather not talk about it.\" </p> <p>His latest mission is transgenic, looking at how to transfer human genes to an animal that could be used as a source of organs. \"Do you know what I do each month? You may not believe this. Do you know what I do? I fly 13,000 miles each month to do my research in California. It's easier to work on the mice in Caltech than it is in London.\" </p> <p>It is the irritating HFEA that forces him to do this. \"The government and the HFEA are both terrified of the Right To Life people, tales of all these little humans that are being frozen and destroyed.\" Red tape has killed good research. \"The truth is that I have people in my unit who say, 'Let's stop working on these embryos, it's just not worth it'. I can't keep the records to the standards required of the HFEA. It's easier just to discard the embryos. That's a common view right across the country. There's no incentive to apply to do good research. There's so many loops to jump through, why do it? At Hammersmith, there's a feeling of great despondency.\" </p> <p>I was feeling pretty despondent myself. I'd just shelled out \u00a32,500 and subjected myself to a powerful drug regime for a treatment the most prominent fertility expert in Britain thought was futile. But then, there was always the chance he might change his mind. He has already done a flip-flop in his assessment of me. Apparently, an hour into our conversation, I am no longer vulnerable but \"a particularly strong character. Otherwise, you wouldn't be sitting here right now, doing this interview on a day when a lot of people would find it really very stressful. It means that you'll go through the treatment again.\" Again? And I realise that, in his new-found lack of faith in IVF, he has already presumed that my treatment cycle has failed. </p> <p>So what should replace IVF? If a woman came to him having failed to get pregnant, what would he do? \"The first thing I would want to do would be to investigate them really thoroughly. Nearly every woman who comes to us who has failed IVF has not been properly investigated. And when you investigate, about half of them you find things that were missing. What we should do is focus much more on what's going wrong. Six-sevenths of those undergoing IVF won't get pregnant - of course they won't - but they'll have no idea why. And there'll be no real attempt to find out why. That's a shocking indictment.\" </p> <p>And, of course, my follow-up question is what would he do with me? For the first time, he falters. \"I don't know.\" </p> <p>Well. Where shall I end? At the close of our interview, I asked Lord Winston if there was anything in particular on which he would like to put the record straight. I was thinking he might point to public misconceptions about GM foods, BSE, or possibly our fear of genetic engineering. But no. His concerns lie elsewhere. \"What did I read in the Guardian this morning? I was really cross. There was Clare Brown [president of the National Infertility Awareness Campaign] being quoted, and the last column said it was in the 80s when we set up patients' support groups. Well - who was the person who first set them up? I bloody set them up! I was the first one, actually, with private income. My income. Clare Brown knows that, actually. She could have actually said so.\" </p> <p>So now the Guardian has put that important record straight. All honour to the King. </p> <p>He goes on to the full tale of setting up the first support group, presumably hoping that I will also include it in my piece. It's a story he tells with feeling. It was, he says, in response to one patient of tubal surgery. \"She said she'd wished she'd never had the operation, because it changed her life: 'Before you operated on me, I knew my tubes were blocked and I knew I couldn't get pregnant. Now I've got open tubes, I live in constant doubt.' I thought, 'Bloody hell!' It had never struck me before. She was the stimulus. Interestingly, she never got pregnant. Never got pregnant. She ended up having IVF years later, and that didn't work either.\" </p> <p>Lord Winston's promotion of the needs of the infertile, the funding of the NHS, better embryo research and himself continues unabated. In the few weeks between our interview and writing it, the indefatigable Lord had been in the papers at least half-a-dozen times, on issues ranging from Prime Minister's Question Time to the use of animal organs in human patients. </p> <p>As for me, I had a positive pregnancy test. It must have been the red wine.</p> <p>\u0095 Superhuman will be broadcast on the BBC in October. The book to the series will be published on October 5 by BBC Worldwide.</p>",

In a New Statesman interview this January, where he famously said that Britain's funding of its health service was \"not as good as Poland's\", he clearly attacked the Government's health record. \"There is a lot wrong with the health service and no one is prepared to say so . . . we've been quite deceitful about it. We haven't told the truth and I'm afraid there will come a time when it will be impossible to disguise the inequality of the health service from the general population.\" Yet even before the interview was published, he was backtracking. \"I believe that the basic direction of NHS policy is right under this Government . . . I did not mean, and I wish to stress this, that the Government are deceiving people over the NHS.\" There is at least one thing he hasn't changed his mind on. He is a passionate believer in a national health service, if not ours. At present, around 10% of IVF is NHS-funded, \"the worst in Europe\", says Winston. \"There's not nearly enough IVF on the NHS. It's grossly under-funded.\" This excludes patients who can't afford the treatment cost of around \u00a32,000, and encourages sloppiness and bad practice. \"The NHS is a way of ensuring decent, proper values. At the 80 or 90 private IVF clinics around the country, you'll have no idea what happens to your embryos after they weren't transferred. You'll have no access to detailed hormonal investigation when the thing goes wrong.\" He believes that the government body responsible for regulating and licensing IVF and PGD, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), is powerless to improve private practice. \"The HFEA can't go to a private clinic and say you will have this kind of audit. All it can do is ensure that people have the absolute modicum of basic treatment, in clean laboratories, which are not contaminated, where there's reasonable record-keeping and so on. Basic things.\" He is not a fan of the HFEA, with its strict licensing procedures for PGD and embryo research. He calls it \"an irritation\". \"I'm not convinced that this is an area of medicine which should be regulated much more strictly than other areas, more than tubal or heart surgery. You inhibit research that needs to be done.\" Unsurprisingly, the HFEA has shunned him. \"I wouldn't join them if I was asked,\" he responds petulantly, before adding, \"but I don't want to talk about that. I don't want to talk about that,\" waving his hands about. Winston has been caught out blabbering before. He indiscreetly gave away that Cherie Blair was apparently going for a Caesarean birth. Predictably, he denied ever having said it, leading to the playing of his fuzzy, taped confession on Radio 4's The World At One. He is well in with New Labour; Blair was a guest on his This Is Your Life. After the New Statesman attack on the NHS, he confidently announced that he expected to be \"able to talk to people in Downing Street in the next week or two\". He clearly believes that the recent \u00a319 billion injection of cash is a good deal due to him. \"The fact that I said the health service needed more money, I'd have to be pretty bloody stupid to believe that it was my doing that we got big money. But _ perhaps what that particular event did was to just highlight the problem.\" He doesn't underestimate his influence. \"Your Life In Their Hands was immensely successful. It was the second-most watched programme ever on BBC2,\" he reminds me about the 80s series he presented. \"It may turn out that the Human Body is the most important thing I've ever done, more important than the 300 publications I've got in various journals, including the one in Nature. It may be more important than the invention of PGD.\" And with such dexterity - the same dexterity for which he was once famed in the operating theatre - he has reminded me that, without Winston, I wouldn't even be there with my hour-old embryo transfer. I have him to thank. He would also like to remind me that last year the Royal Society awarded him the Faraday prize for \"the furtherance of the public understanding of science\". Any modesty is certainly mock. But there is a crack in his super confidence. He describes his forthcoming six-part BBC series, Superhuman, which predictably examines genetics, as \"a disaster. I'd rather not talk about it.\" His latest mission is transgenic, looking at how to transfer human genes to an animal that could be used as a source of organs. \"Do you know what I do each month? You may not believe this. Do you know what I do? I fly 13,000 miles each month to do my research in California. It's easier to work on the mice in Caltech than it is in London.\" It is the irritating HFEA that forces him to do this. \"The government and the HFEA are both terrified of the Right To Life people, tales of all these little humans that are being frozen and destroyed.\" Red tape has killed good research. \"The truth is that I have people in my unit who say, 'Let's stop working on these embryos, it's just not worth it'. I can't keep the records to the standards required of the HFEA. It's easier just to discard the embryos. That's a common view right across the country. There's no incentive to apply to do good research. There's so many loops to jump through, why do it? At Hammersmith, there's a feeling of great despondency.\" I was feeling pretty despondent myself. I'd just shelled out \u00a32,500 and subjected myself to a powerful drug regime for a treatment the most prominent fertility expert in Britain thought was futile. But then, there was always the chance he might change his mind. He has already done a flip-flop in his assessment of me. Apparently, an hour into our conversation, I am no longer vulnerable but \"a particularly strong character. Otherwise, you wouldn't be sitting here right now, doing this interview on a day when a lot of people would find it really very stressful. It means that you'll go through the treatment again.\" Again? And I realise that, in his new-found lack of faith in IVF, he has already presumed that my treatment cycle has failed. So what should replace IVF? If a woman came to him having failed to get pregnant, what would he do? \"The first thing I would want to do would be to investigate them really thoroughly. Nearly every woman who comes to us who has failed IVF has not been properly investigated. And when you investigate, about half of them you find things that were missing. What we should do is focus much more on what's going wrong. Six-sevenths of those undergoing IVF won't get pregnant - of course they won't - but they'll have no idea why. And there'll be no real attempt to find out why. That's a shocking indictment.\" And, of course, my follow-up question is what would he do with me? For the first time, he falters. \"I don't know.\" Well. Where shall I end? At the close of our interview, I asked Lord Winston if there was anything in particular on which he would like to put the record straight. I was thinking he might point to public misconceptions about GM foods, BSE, or possibly our fear of genetic engineering. But no. His concerns lie elsewhere. \"What did I read in the Guardian this morning? I was really cross. There was Clare Brown [president of the National Infertility Awareness Campaign] being quoted, and the last column said it was in the 80s when we set up patients' support groups. Well - who was the person who first set them up? I bloody set them up! I was the first one, actually, with private income. My income. Clare Brown knows that, actually. She could have actually said so.\" So now the Guardian has put that important record straight. All honour to the King. He goes on to the full tale of setting up the first support group, presumably hoping that I will also include it in my piece. It's a story he tells with feeling. It was, he says, in response to one patient of tubal surgery. \"She said she'd wished she'd never had the operation, because it changed her life: 'Before you operated on me, I knew my tubes were blocked and I knew I couldn't get pregnant. Now I've got open tubes, I live in constant doubt.' I thought, 'Bloody hell!' It had never struck me before. She was the stimulus. Interestingly, she never got pregnant. Never got pregnant. She ended up having IVF years later, and that didn't work either.\" Lord Winston's promotion of the needs of the infertile, the funding of the NHS, better embryo research and himself continues unabated. In the few weeks between our interview and writing it, the indefatigable Lord had been in the papers at least half-a-dozen times, on issues ranging from Prime Minister's Question Time to the use of animal organs in human patients. As for me, I had a positive pregnancy test. It must have been the red wine. \u0095 Superhuman will be broadcast on the BBC in October. The book to the series will be published on October 5 by BBC Worldwide.",

      "body": "<p>It was the first single-word culinary dilemma that had been sent to Rosie Sykes, Kitchen Doctor, so it would have been churlish to pass it over. \"Problem - age!\" Norma Haemmerle had written with remarkable succinctness. \"At 69, I get tired if I have to spend too much time on preparation. My partner, Richard, is older, and is on a low-cholesterol diet, but we both love to eat. And home-cooked food always tastes better than ready meals/frozen things, etc.\" How true, thought Rosie, and set her grey matter to devising a set of good-value, easy-to-prepare dishes (the words \"one\" and \"pot\" sprang immediately to mind) with which to alleviate Norma's burden, a task complicated just a little by Richard's unshakable aversion to tomato in all its manifestations.</p> <p>And so it was that the KD arrived one wet summer's day at the Haemmerle's Arnos Grove home - as northern a part of north London as you could find without stumbling into the countryside - laden with enough comestibles to create five mouth-watering meals, each of which would take no longer than half-an-hour to prepare. \"Not only will I not have to cook for a week,\" exclaimed Norma gleefully on seeing bag after bag unpacked in her kitchen, \"but Richard - who is very good about saying, 'You look tired', and then going for a takeaway, so I don't have to cook - won't have to trek outside, either.\"</p> <p>\"Most of this can be cooked and then frozen,\" explained Rosie, before coming over all worried at the thought of leaving Norma and Richard with five dinners but nowhere to store them: \"I hope you have enough room in your freezer.\"</p> <p>She needn't have fretted - Norma had been busy: \"Actually, I emptied it a bit this morning.\"</p> <p>Rosie breathed easier, and set about preparing the first two dishes, pot-roast poussin with apple, parsnip, ginger and potato mash, and spiced lamb with spinach and bulgur. \"Cooking would be much easier if I had you here to do the vegetables for me every day,\" said Norma. \"You see, I like to read cookbooks, to drool over the recipes, but when it comes to lunchtime... don't you core the apples?\" She seemed a little concerned all of a sudden.</p> <p>\"Oh yes,\" replied Rosie, \" but I always quarter them first. That way, you can make sure you cut out all of those horrid hard white bits in the core - 'toenails', my mother used to call them.\"</p> <p>\"Ughh -that doesn't sound very appetising,\" grimaced Norma as she assumed a position next to Richard, giving them the perfect vantage point from which to watch Rosie go about her business, browning the meats, and peeling, chopping and dicing like a mad thing.</p> <p>\"Er, do you use spices much?\" asked Rosie, her features again succumbing to that little expression of alarm as she surveyed the fresh and dried spices arrayed on the worktop.</p> <p>\"Oh yes,\" replied Norma, \"in soups and the like, but I don't really know how to use them properly.\"</p> <p>\"You shouldn't worry about that ,\" said Rosie, who, it must be said seemed rather relieved at Norma's response. \"It's all about trial and error; you work it out as you go along. That's how I learned to use them, anyway - do you cook at all, Richard?\"</p> <p>\"Well, I would,\" he answered, a little sheepishly, \"but Norma doesn't really trust my cooking.\"</p> <p>\"I trust you to open a tin of beans,\" laughed Norma. But Richard wasn't paying attention - his head was almost in the lamb pot.</p> <p>\"It doesn't need any accompaniment,\" said Rosie quickly, perhaps for fear that Richard was about to gobble up the pot's contents. \"It's got spinach for roughage and bulgur wheat for bulk.\"</p> <p>Richard raised his head, apparently drunk on the heady scent of cinnamon and cumin. \"It smells magnificent,\" he said.</p> <p>Then it was into the oven with the lamb and chicken, and on to the remaining dishes: a soup, a cod-and-bean combo and a clafoutis (\"Just a posh word for a toad-in-the-hole type thingy,\" explained Rosie). But as she set about getting everything ready, Rosie's perturbed demeanour reappeared: \"Um . . . I was meant to be doing things that didn't involve too much standing up and chopping, wasn't I, but I seem to have done little else since I got here.\"</p> <p>\"That's because you're making five meals at once,\" said Norma, \"which is not something I'll be doing, is it?\"</p> <p>\"I hadn't thought of that,\" said Rosie, as if for the first time realising that people in the real world, unlike professional cooks, tend to make only one meal at a time. \"The soup will be ready soon, so you could have it for lunch. It's a minestrone sort of thing, only without tomatoes.\"</p> <p>\"That's in honour of you, Richard,\" said Norma.</p> <p>\"I expected you just to come here and cook,\" said Richard, \"not to cater to our idiosyncrasies.\" Mind you, he didn't seem disappointed that she had.</p> <p>\"Well, the whole shebang is geared to you ,\" said Rosie. \"That's why I rang beforehand, to check if there was anything either of you hated.\"</p> <p>\"Indeed,\" said Norma. \"And I wish I'd been thinking more clearly when you called - I would have asked for nothing but Belgian chocolates!\"</p> <p>The soup was now ready, and the clafoutis and fish were well on their way. \"There you go,\" said Rosie, popping a blob of pesto on top of each soup serving and handing them over to Richard and Norma.</p> <p>\"This is super,\" said Norma after the first spoonful. \"Ahem, sorry, I didn't mean to say that,\" she said of the unintentional pun. \"This is delicious, rather.\"</p> <p>Rosie, meantime, was busy checking on her clafoutis. \"It smells good,\" she said. \"But then, I'm a sucker for cheese. It looks fantastic, too . . . Oh dear, I've done a lot of blowing my own trumpet today.\"</p> <p>\"Don't you worry,\" said Norma benevolently. \"I'll second you. It's been a bit like going to a cookery school, except I'm the only pupil.\"</p> <p>Richard, who had popped out of the kitchen for a moment, reappeared. \"You've come back at the right moment,\" said Norma. \"I don't know how you do it, but you always arrive the moment something comes out of the oven or off the stove.\"</p> <p>Richard just grinned contentedly and dived into the clafoutis. \"Lovely - but it's a bit hot,\" he said, puffing his cheeks as if it were burning their insides. He obviously wasn't that incapacitated, however, for he positively pounced on Rosie's next offering, the cod-and-bean stew. \"Careful,\" warned Norma. \"That, too, is still very hot.\"</p> <p>\"It's fabulous,\" said Richard, taking another forkful. \"Never mind just a taste: I'm eating all of this\"</p> <p>All recipes serve two.</p> <p><b> Spiced lamb with spinach and bulgur</b></p> <p>I've used the bulgur a bit like pearl barley - whatever, it is an excellent way to get some starch into the meal.</p> <p><b> 1 small onion, chopped <br> 1 clove garlic, crushed <br> 450g diced lamb <br> 2 tsp cinnamon <br> 1 tsp ground cumin <br> 1 tsp ground coriander <br> 4 tbsp plain flour, seasoned <br> 75ml white wine <br> 150ml meat stock <br> 125g frozen, chopped spinach <br> 2 tbsp olive oil <br> 100g bulgur wheat <br> 200ml water <br> 1 tbsp butter <br> 2 tbsp pinenuts <br> 2 tbsp raisins</b></p> <p>Preheat the oven to 190C/375F/gas mark 5. Heat the oil in a casserole, toss the lamb in the flour, and add to the casserole, along with the spices (you may need to do this in batches). When all the meat is browned, push it to one side of the pan, add the garlic and onion, and saut\u00e9 until the onion is soft. Mix everything in the pan together, pour in the wine and stock, bring to the boil, cover, and put into the oven. Leave it to do its thing for about an hour.</p> <p>Meanwhile, melt the butter in a heavy pan and add the bulgur, stirring to coat all the grains with butter. Add the water, bring to the boil and simmer until the liquid is absorbed - about 15 minutes. Set the cooked wheat to one side.</p> <p>Return the casserole to the top of the stove, add the spinach and bulgur, bring back to the boil and put back in the oven for around 15 minutes, until the wheat is fully puffed up. Stir in the raisins and pinenuts before serving.</p> <p><b> Pot-roast poussin</b></p> <p>A great one-pot dish, giving you a meal of crispy poussin with mash and gravy: the end result is fantastically moist.</p> <p><b> 1 decent-sized poussin <br> 30g butter <br> 1 tbsp oil <br> lemon, juiced <br> 2 apples, peeled, cored and quartered <br> 2 large baking potatoes, peeled and cut into chunks <br> 2 parsnips, peeled and cut into chunks <br> 1 tsp fresh ginger, peeled and grated <br> head garlic, peeled <br> 1 splash brandy (optional) <br> 60ml cider <br> 1 bouquet garni</b></p> <p>Heat half the butter and oil in a frying pan, pop in the poussin and brown all over. Remove the bird and, while the pan is still hot, add the cider and brandy, stirring to loosen all the bits and cooking flavours in the pan.</p> <p>Grease a large casserole with the remaining butter. Toss the apple and ginger in lemon juice. Arrange the potatoes, parsnips and apples in the base of the casserole, followed by the garlic cloves. Stuff the juiced lemon and bouquet garni into the poussin's cavity and place the bird, breast-side down, on the apple-and-vegetable bed. Pour over the cider/brandy mix from the pan, cover, and cook in the oven for an hour, until the juices from the bird run clear.</p> <p>Lift out the bird and leave to rest for a few minutes. Strain off any cooking liquor, to use as a sauce. Mash the solids, or put them in a blender for a smoother result. Cut the poussin in half and serve with the mashed veg, gravy and maybe some peas or broccoli.</p> <p><b> Cod with white beans</b></p> <p>Based on a delicious recipe from my friend, Sue Lewis, head chef at the Cow in west London. Hers has tomato in it; I have made it without, by request.</p> <p><b> 450g cod fillets, cut into chunks <br> 1 tbsp oil <br> 1 onion, finely chopped <br> 1 red pepper, cut into strips <br> 2 rashers smoked bacon, de-rinded and chopped into pieces <br> 1 tsp paprika <br> 60ml white wine <br> 375ml fish stock <br> 1 tin cannellini beans <br> 1 clove garlic, crushed <br> 1 handful parsley, chopped <br> 1 lemon, rind grated</b></p> <p>Heat the oil in a heavy-based pan, add the bacon and fry until it begins to brown. Add the onion, and sweat until soft. Add the red pepper and paprika, and saut\u00e9 until soft. Pour in the wine and reduce by half. Chuck in the beans and stock, bring to the boil, and simmer for 15 minutes to let the flavours come together. If you run low on liquid, top up with water. Season the fish, add it to the pot, and simmer over a low heat for 10 minutes until the flesh is opaque, a sign that it is cooked.</p> <p>Meanwhile, mix together the garlic, parsley and lemon zest (a mixture known as gremolata), stir into the casserole and serve immediately with some good bread and a green salad.</p> <p><b> Savoury clafoutis</b></p> <p>A nice, quick lunch dish, or a side dish to grilled meat or sausages. These quantities make more than enough for two, but you can freeze them.</p> <p><b> 55g plain flour, sifted and seasoned <br> 1 egg <br> 70ml milk mixed with 70ml water <br> 45g pitted black olives <br> 4 spring onions, finely chopped <br> 55g taleggio (or mozzarella) <br> 55g Parmesan, grated <br> 4 anchovy fillets, chopped <br> Butter, for greasing</b></p> <p>Preheat the oven to 190C/375F/gas mark 5. Tip the flour into a bowl. Beat the egg into the water/milk mix. Make a well in the centre of the flour, tip in the egg mixture, stir to dissolve the flour, and leave to stand. Grease a baking tin (or tins) and put it in the fridge. Roughly chop the olives, break the taleggio into chunks and tip into a bowl, along with the anchovies and spring onions. Mix together and check the seasoning.</p> <p>Pour a little batter into the bottom of the tin, put a generous spoonful of the cheese, anchovy and onion mixture on top, and fill the baking tin with the remaining batter. Sprinkle with Parmesan and bake for 30-35 minutes, until the clafoutis is risen and golden. If you're making a big one, this may take up to 45 minutes. Serve immediately with a salad.</p> <p><b> Big soup</b></p> <p>My version of a minestrone-style soup. I use chickpeas instead of white beans, because I love their nutty, earthy taste. The stock and pesto can be homemade, of course, but we're going for speed and ease here. Also, a tin of tomatoes would not go amiss, but I have not used any because Richard really doesn't like them.</p> <p><b> 1 tin chickpeas (or 350g dried chickpeas, soaked, drained and cooked) <br> 55g soup pasta, or even spaghetti broken into 4cm lengths <br> 1 litre vegetable stock <br> 2 leeks, trimmed and sliced <br> 1 head broccoli, broken into florets, the stalks peeled and cut into slices <br> 1 courgette, cut into rounds <br> 1 head fennel, trimmed and sliced <br> 1 large carrot, peeled and cubed <br> 55g French beans, top and tailed <br> 6 new potatoes, washed and halved <br> 2 large tbsp pesto <br> 2 slices white bread <br> 1 clove garlic, peeled</b></p> <p>Put the carrot, new potatoes, fennel and leeks in large pan with the stock, bring to the boil and simmer for 30 minutes. Add the chickpeas, courgettes, beans, broccoli and pasta, then simmer for 10 minutes. Taste and season.</p> <p>Toast the bread, rub it with garlic (the toast will act like a grater), drizzle with olive oil and place in the bottom of two soup bowls. Ladle over the soup, top with a little pesto, and stir in the pesto before you take a mouthful</p> <p>\u0095 Do you have a culinary problem that needs the Kitchen Doctor's expert treatment?

It looks fantastic, too . . . Oh dear, I've done a lot of blowing my own trumpet today.\" \"Don't you worry,\" said Norma benevolently. \"I'll second you. It's been a bit like going to a cookery school, except I'm the only pupil.\" Richard, who had popped out of the kitchen for a moment, reappeared. \"You've come back at the right moment,\" said Norma. \"I don't know how you do it, but you always arrive the moment something comes out of the oven or off the stove.\" Richard just grinned contentedly and dived into the clafoutis. \"Lovely - but it's a bit hot,\" he said, puffing his cheeks as if it were burning their insides. He obviously wasn't that incapacitated, however, for he positively pounced on Rosie's next offering, the cod-and-bean stew. \"Careful,\" warned Norma. \"That, too, is still very hot.\" \"It's fabulous,\" said Richard, taking another forkful. \"Never mind just a taste: I'm eating all of this\" All recipes serve two. Spiced lamb with spinach and bulgur I've used the bulgur a bit like pearl barley - whatever, it is an excellent way to get some starch into the meal. 1 small onion, chopped 1 clove garlic, crushed 450g diced lamb 2 tsp cinnamon 1 tsp ground cumin 1 tsp ground coriander 4 tbsp plain flour, seasoned 75ml white wine 150ml meat stock 125g frozen, chopped spinach 2 tbsp olive oil 100g bulgur wheat 200ml water 1 tbsp butter 2 tbsp pinenuts 2 tbsp raisins Preheat the oven to 190C/375F/gas mark 5. Heat the oil in a casserole, toss the lamb in the flour, and add to the casserole, along with the spices (you may need to do this in batches). When all the meat is browned, push it to one side of the pan, add the garlic and onion, and saut\u00e9 until the onion is soft. Mix everything in the pan together, pour in the wine and stock, bring to the boil, cover, and put into the oven. Leave it to do its thing for about an hour. Meanwhile, melt the butter in a heavy pan and add the bulgur, stirring to coat all the grains with butter. Add the water, bring to the boil and simmer until the liquid is absorbed - about 15 minutes. Set the cooked wheat to one side. Return the casserole to the top of the stove, add the spinach and bulgur, bring back to the boil and put back in the oven for around 15 minutes, until the wheat is fully puffed up. Stir in the raisins and pinenuts before serving. Pot-roast poussin A great one-pot dish, giving you a meal of crispy poussin with mash and gravy: the end result is fantastically moist. 1 decent-sized poussin 30g butter 1 tbsp oil lemon, juiced 2 apples, peeled, cored and quartered 2 large baking potatoes, peeled and cut into chunks 2 parsnips, peeled and cut into chunks 1 tsp fresh ginger, peeled and grated head garlic, peeled 1 splash brandy (optional) 60ml cider 1 bouquet garni Heat half the butter and oil in a frying pan, pop in the poussin and brown all over. Remove the bird and, while the pan is still hot, add the cider and brandy, stirring to loosen all the bits and cooking flavours in the pan. Grease a large casserole with the remaining butter. Toss the apple and ginger in lemon juice. Arrange the potatoes, parsnips and apples in the base of the casserole, followed by the garlic cloves. Stuff the juiced lemon and bouquet garni into the poussin's cavity and place the bird, breast-side down, on the apple-and-vegetable bed. Pour over the cider/brandy mix from the pan, cover, and cook in the oven for an hour, until the juices from the bird run clear. Lift out the bird and leave to rest for a few minutes. Strain off any cooking liquor, to use as a sauce. Mash the solids, or put them in a blender for a smoother result. Cut the poussin in half and serve with the mashed veg, gravy and maybe some peas or broccoli. Cod with white beans Based on a delicious recipe from my friend, Sue Lewis, head chef at the Cow in west London. Hers has tomato in it; I have made it without, by request. 450g cod fillets, cut into chunks 1 tbsp oil 1 onion, finely chopped 1 red pepper, cut into strips 2 rashers smoked bacon, de-rinded and chopped into pieces 1 tsp paprika 60ml white wine 375ml fish stock 1 tin cannellini beans 1 clove garlic, crushed 1 handful parsley, chopped 1 lemon, rind grated Heat the oil in a heavy-based pan, add the bacon and fry until it begins to brown. Add the onion, and sweat until soft. Add the red pepper and paprika, and saut\u00e9 until soft. Pour in the wine and reduce by half. Chuck in the beans and stock, bring to the boil, and simmer for 15 minutes to let the flavours come together. If you run low on liquid, top up with water. Season the fish, add it to the pot, and simmer over a low heat for 10 minutes until the flesh is opaque, a sign that it is cooked. Meanwhile, mix together the garlic, parsley and lemon zest (a mixture known as gremolata), stir into the casserole and serve immediately with some good bread and a green salad. Savoury clafoutis A nice, quick lunch dish, or a side dish to grilled meat or sausages. These quantities make more than enough for two, but you can freeze them. 55g plain flour, sifted and seasoned 1 egg 70ml milk mixed with 70ml water 45g pitted black olives 4 spring onions, finely chopped 55g taleggio (or mozzarella) 55g Parmesan, grated 4 anchovy fillets, chopped Butter, for greasing Preheat the oven to 190C/375F/gas mark 5. Tip the flour into a bowl. Beat the egg into the water/milk mix. Make a well in the centre of the flour, tip in the egg mixture, stir to dissolve the flour, and leave to stand. Grease a baking tin (or tins) and put it in the fridge. Roughly chop the olives, break the taleggio into chunks and tip into a bowl, along with the anchovies and spring onions. Mix together and check the seasoning. Pour a little batter into the bottom of the tin, put a generous spoonful of the cheese, anchovy and onion mixture on top, and fill the baking tin with the remaining batter. Sprinkle with Parmesan and bake for 30-35 minutes, until the clafoutis is risen and golden. If you're making a big one, this may take up to 45 minutes. Serve immediately with a salad. Big soup My version of a minestrone-style soup. I use chickpeas instead of white beans, because I love their nutty, earthy taste. The stock and pesto can be homemade, of course, but we're going for speed and ease here. Also, a tin of tomatoes would not go amiss, but I have not used any because Richard really doesn't like them. 1 tin chickpeas (or 350g dried chickpeas, soaked, drained and cooked) 55g soup pasta, or even spaghetti broken into 4cm lengths 1 litre vegetable stock 2 leeks, trimmed and sliced 1 head broccoli, broken into florets, the stalks peeled and cut into slices 1 courgette, cut into rounds 1 head fennel, trimmed and sliced 1 large carrot, peeled and cubed 55g French beans, top and tailed 6 new potatoes, washed and halved 2 large tbsp pesto 2 slices white bread 1 clove garlic, peeled Put the carrot, new potatoes, fennel and leeks in large pan with the stock, bring to the boil and simmer for 30 minutes. Add the chickpeas, courgettes, beans, broccoli and pasta, then simmer for 10 minutes. Taste and season. Toast the bread, rub it with garlic (the toast will act like a grater), drizzle with olive oil and place in the bottom of two soup bowls. Ladle over the soup, top with a little pesto, and stir in the pesto before you take a mouthful \u0095 Do you have a culinary problem that needs the Kitchen Doctor's expert treatment?

      "body": "<p>Tina Modotti was always rather dismissive of her beauty - as only the very beautiful tend to be. The photographer Edward Weston was famously smitten by her: his nude portraits of Modotti are among the most arresting images of the 20th century. Diego Rivera immortalised her in his public murals. Pablo Neruda penned her epitaph: \"Perfect your gentle name, perfect your fragile life,\" he wrote. She inspired deep infatuation, great art, poignant poetry. </p> <p>Modotti's looks served her well throughout her short life, and were instrumental in kick-starting her spell as a 20s Hollywood silent-screen star, the first of several varied careers. Soon after giving up film work, she became the model, lover and apprentice of Weston. </p> <p>A kind of It girl of the avant-garde, Modotti was both celebrated and vilified in her lifetime. She was well known for her grand romances with illustrious men, and for her apparently effortless knack of inspiring others. \"Drama goes with her, has been born with her and will die with her,\" read one particularly febrile newspaper editorial following the assassination of her communist Cuban lover, Julio Antonio Mella - and a charge against her of conspiracy in his murder. </p> <p>Add to such high-octane intrigue her political activism in Mexico, Moscow and Europe - not to mention her early and sudden death in 1942, at the age of 46 - and it is easy to see why the Modotti myth has been revisited in recent years. Unsurprisingly, there has been talk of a feature film about her life - she is an immensely versatile icon, representing many things to many people: the dangerous femme fatale; the gentle, tragic spirit; the proto-feminist; the committed revolutionary. </p> <p>Then, of course, there is the matter of her photography - ultimately, the only real certainty about her. Whatever the feverish speculation that surrounded the cult of her persona - and surrounds it still - Modotti was a great and visionary photographer. Her gifts and passion were unique, and her skill truly groundbreaking. In a photographic career of less than a decade, she produced work that was so startlingly innovative that she is now widely considered to be an important pioneer of modern photography. So much so, in fact, that a few years ago one of her flower studies (Roses, from 1924) commanded nearly $200,000 at auction in New York, an unprecedented amount for the sale of a photograph. </p> <p>Still, such is the melodrama that surrounds her story - a mythology fuelled by the portraits of her as much as by her own images - that it has tended to colour the perception of her work. Recently shown in Arles, and moving next month to Helsinki, is a new exhibition, Tina Modotti And The Mexican Renaissance, which attempts to strip Modotti of the romanticism that surrounds her, and to present her work in a pure form within a strictly historical context. </p> <p>\"The story of her life has been presented as very Hollywood. Her reputation as a photographer must stand or fall by the intrinsic quality of her work,\" says the curator of the show, Sam Stourdz\u00e9, who describes the exhibition as \"austere\" in its conception. Excluding both Weston's portraits and Modotti's own famous flower studies, the show concentrates, instead, on her social documentary work in Mexico between 1923 and 1930. </p> <p>The exhibition was made possible by a surprise discovery. In 1994, the American biographer Patricia Albers, while researching for a book on Modotti, went to Oregon to meet the family of her subject's first husband, Roubaix de L'Abrie Rich\u00e9y, an American poet of French-Canadian origin known as Robo. The family directed Albers to their attic, where she found two crates packed with papers, letters, telegrams - and some original photographs and contact sheets that had never before been seen in public. They had been sent to Robo's mother, with whom Modotti had stayed in touch following her husband's death in 1923. The provenance was without doubt; many of the pictures even bore the photographer's distinctive handwriting on their reverse sides, \"like postcards\", says Stourdz\u00e9. The exhibition is the first showcase in Europe for these photographs, and they will be displayed alongside photographs from the private collection of New York dealer Truck Morton. </p> <p>It is, perhaps, no surprise that Modotti was so drawn to Mexico. She said that it reminded her of her homeland. Born into a working-class family in Udine, northern Italy, in 1896, Modotti had followed her father and sister to California in 1913. She found work as a seamstress, but soon emerged from obscurity when she took to the stage in the theatres of the San Francisco Italian community and, following her marriage to Robo, the Hollywood studio world. She enjoyed some success on the silent-movie screen, although she was always typecast as a gypsy or harem girl. \"The exotic allure of Tina Modotti,\" proclaimed a poster for The Tiger's Eye of 1920. \"They could not picture an Italian girl except with a knife in her teeth and blood in her eye,\" Weston later wrote. </p> <p>Modotti soon tired of the movie world, however, and - spurred on by her adulterous liaison with Weston - she became increasingly drawn to photography. There is no doubt that she benefited from the tutelage of the brilliant Weston: much can be seen of his influence in her work - she quickly assimilated his formal, rigorous skill in composition and meticulous approach to developing and printing. Photography became her passion, and even when the relationship with Weston foundered, she ensured that the apprenticeship thrived. </p> <p>Despite her affair, it seems that Modotti's marriage to Robo was still functioning. It was Robo who first left for Mexico, in 1921, and his wife planned to join him later. A couple of months into his stay, however, he became ill with smallpox and, after a violent few days, died. Despite Robo's death, Modotti went to Mexico as planned, where she set up her own studio in Mexico City and began to earn her living through portrait photography while continuing to work on her increasingly politically-conscious photographs. </p> <p>In 1910, the 34-year dictatorship of General Porfirio Diaz had collapsed into a brutal conflict that tore Mexico apart. It wasn't until a decade later that hostilities subsided, and when the left-wing leader General Alvaro Obregon came to power in 1920, the nation experienced a burst of creative energy and optimism. Modernisation was getting underway, and the arts were, for the first time in living memory, being treated with a new seriousness. An ambitious cultural policy was coming into play, combining social and educational initiatives. Little wonder that intellectuals, writers, poets and artists were drawn to Mexico City, which quickly established itself as the central axis of this cultural renewal and became home to an artistic revolution. It was not only painters such as Diego Rivera, Frida Kahlo and David Alfaro Siqueiros who were exponents of the new vision; photographers, too, played a major role. </p> <p>Modotti quite easily found a place for herself in Mexico's artistic renaissance. She was especially struck by the work of the muralists, who encapsulated the mood of a country emerging from dictatorship and unrest: the desire to rediscover the country's pre-Hispanic traditions and renew its Indian roots was at the heart of the new movement, whatever the pictorial innovations it pioneered.<strong> </strong> \"The Indian people of Mexico became like her family,\" says Stourdz\u00e9. So much so, in fact, that Modotti, shocked by what she had heard about her native Italy under fascist rule, joined the Mexican Communist party in 1927. </p> <p>Weston taught her much, but the humanity and social engagement in Modotti's work are all her own. She photographed the life around her with such a revolutionary fervour that many of her pictures were published in the Mexican communist party's El Machete newspaper. She allied herself to the Estridentista, or Stridentist movement, a circle of writers and artists with internationalist aspirations for their country. It was a time when many photographers were clinging to a romantic ideal of Mexico, yet Modotti concentrated on the urban reality: she focused on Mexico as a nation in transition, and photographs such as those of telephone wires and telegraph poles became symbolic of the industrial modernisation that held such promise. Such images were rigorously constructed and, with their bold patterns and vertiginous angles, a million miles from the bucolic sensibility that was the norm at the time. </p> <p>This is not to say that Modotti was immune to \"exoticism\"; on the contrary, she was equally drawn to the picturesque drama of Mexican life, and her subjects are ennobled in her images. Many of the pictures discovered by Patricia Albers present images of workers as valiant heroes: Indians Carrying Blocks Of Stone ... (1927), for example, and Indians Carrying Corn Husks ... (1927) depict Mexico's indigenous population as the backbone of the country. Her work also emphasised the shortcomings of government institutions, capturing the stark contrasts between the lives of the rich and the poor by juxtaposing urban squalor with bourgeois scenes. </p> <p>Also among the new finds is an arresting image of a young girl writing. It's an image full of hopefulness: at that time, around 80% of the population were illiterate, and the government were introducing a literacy programme. Alongside this picture were found numerous street scenes of women and children going about their daily business in harsh conditions, some of them shot in soft focus. The photographs Making Tortillas and Women With Children Doing Laundry, along with the images of women carrying heavy loads on their heads, portray stoicism in adversity and a tenderness towards the subjects that stops just short of sentimentality. Modotti's emotional engagement, made almost abstract by the European modernism she had inherited from Weston, makes for some striking invention. In the shot of a political rally in 1928, before the murder of Obregon, the bold patterns made by the straw sombreros and draped white cotton clothing seem like symbols of quiet order amid tumult. </p> <p>Hands Resting On A Tool, meanwhile, a now almost-iconic image, is shown in the exhibition alongside one of Albers's discoveries, a shot of the gnarled feet and battered toenails of a Mexican-Indian worker in hyper-real glory. They make an arresting sight, as does the 1929 portrait of Modotti wearing Tehuantepec Indian costume - a self- portrait, and not a particularly accomplished photo, but a telling moment in the life of a woman for whom Mexico had become a kind of spiritual home. </p> <p>The photograph of the mother nursing her baby, in which the feeding infant's eyes are open, is also one of the newly discovered pictures. It is a particularly poignant shot, bearing in mind Modotti's own experiences. She was unable to have children - a string of grand passions transformed her life, but she died alone, with no family. All the more ironic, then, that Rivera miscasts Modotti as an earth mother in one of his murals high above the altar in a Mexican cathedral. Stourdz\u00e9 is philosophical on the subject. \"I think that it was because she had no family life that she was a great artist. She put everything into her photographs.\" </p> <p>Modotti's relationship with Julio Antonio Mella, the leader of the Cuban communist party who was living in exile in Mexico, drew her more deeply into political life. But after just four months together, Mella was assassinated as the couple were walking along a street in Mexico City. In the aftermath of his death, Modotti was arrested and tried for conspiracy in the murder, and the Mexican newspapers made headlines out of the false allegations. At the same time, Modotti was viewed as the official \"widow\" of the martyred hero, and became a kind of mascot for the international revolutionary movement. </p> <p>Modotti was eventually acquitted, but by 1930 all foreign communists were being expelled from Mexico. The authorities were watching Modotti closely, and became convinced - not without cause - that her house had become a base for insurgents. She was implicated, falsely, in a conspiracy to kill the Mexican president, and was deported. She spent the rest of the decade based in Moscow as a Soviet agent and apparatchik, and during the Spanish Civil War acted as an organiser with Red Aid. When the republican cause was dashed, she returned to Mexico, an exile with a false passport, and - together with her new lover, the Spanish Civil War hero Vittorio Vidali - became involved again in political work. She died there from a heart attack, although rumours suggested foul play or even suicide. </p> <p>Modotti remained in the public eye - in Weston's nudes and Rivera's murals - even after her fashionableness as a photographer had faded,<strong> </strong> and the press remained intrigued by her starry presence. When she arrived in the US following her deportation from Mexico in 1930, press photographers scrabbled to take her picture. Trying to convince her to pose for them, they promised to make her look pretty. She later described the scene in a letter to Weston, adding, \"I could not understand what prettiness had to do with the revolutionary movement.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Tina Modotti And The Mexican Renaissance will show at Helsinki City Art Museum from September 12-November 15. A book of the exhibition, with 80 reproductions, is published by Jean Michel Place and is available from <a href=\"http://www.jmplace.com\">www.jmplace.com</a>.</p>",

Many of the pictures discovered by Patricia Albers present images of workers as valiant heroes: Indians Carrying Blocks Of Stone ... (1927), for example, and Indians Carrying Corn Husks ... (1927) depict Mexico's indigenous population as the backbone of the country. Her work also emphasised the shortcomings of government institutions, capturing the stark contrasts between the lives of the rich and the poor by juxtaposing urban squalor with bourgeois scenes. Also among the new finds is an arresting image of a young girl writing. It's an image full of hopefulness: at that time, around 80% of the population were illiterate, and the government were introducing a literacy programme. Alongside this picture were found numerous street scenes of women and children going about their daily business in harsh conditions, some of them shot in soft focus. The photographs Making Tortillas and Women With Children Doing Laundry, along with the images of women carrying heavy loads on their heads, portray stoicism in adversity and a tenderness towards the subjects that stops just short of sentimentality. Modotti's emotional engagement, made almost abstract by the European modernism she had inherited from Weston, makes for some striking invention. In the shot of a political rally in 1928, before the murder of Obregon, the bold patterns made by the straw sombreros and draped white cotton clothing seem like symbols of quiet order amid tumult. Hands Resting On A Tool, meanwhile, a now almost-iconic image, is shown in the exhibition alongside one of Albers's discoveries, a shot of the gnarled feet and battered toenails of a Mexican-Indian worker in hyper-real glory. They make an arresting sight, as does the 1929 portrait of Modotti wearing Tehuantepec Indian costume - a self- portrait, and not a particularly accomplished photo, but a telling moment in the life of a woman for whom Mexico had become a kind of spiritual home. The photograph of the mother nursing her baby, in which the feeding infant's eyes are open, is also one of the newly discovered pictures. It is a particularly poignant shot, bearing in mind Modotti's own experiences. She was unable to have children - a string of grand passions transformed her life, but she died alone, with no family. All the more ironic, then, that Rivera miscasts Modotti as an earth mother in one of his murals high above the altar in a Mexican cathedral. Stourdz\u00e9 is philosophical on the subject. \"I think that it was because she had no family life that she was a great artist. She put everything into her photographs.\" Modotti's relationship with Julio Antonio Mella, the leader of the Cuban communist party who was living in exile in Mexico, drew her more deeply into political life. But after just four months together, Mella was assassinated as the couple were walking along a street in Mexico City. In the aftermath of his death, Modotti was arrested and tried for conspiracy in the murder, and the Mexican newspapers made headlines out of the false allegations. At the same time, Modotti was viewed as the official \"widow\" of the martyred hero, and became a kind of mascot for the international revolutionary movement. Modotti was eventually acquitted, but by 1930 all foreign communists were being expelled from Mexico. The authorities were watching Modotti closely, and became convinced - not without cause - that her house had become a base for insurgents. She was implicated, falsely, in a conspiracy to kill the Mexican president, and was deported. She spent the rest of the decade based in Moscow as a Soviet agent and apparatchik, and during the Spanish Civil War acted as an organiser with Red Aid. When the republican cause was dashed, she returned to Mexico, an exile with a false passport, and - together with her new lover, the Spanish Civil War hero Vittorio Vidali - became involved again in political work. She died there from a heart attack, although rumours suggested foul play or even suicide. Modotti remained in the public eye - in Weston's nudes and Rivera's murals - even after her fashionableness as a photographer had faded, and the press remained intrigued by her starry presence. When she arrived in the US following her deportation from Mexico in 1930, press photographers scrabbled to take her picture. Trying to convince her to pose for them, they promised to make her look pretty. She later described the scene in a letter to Weston, adding, \"I could not understand what prettiness had to do with the revolutionary movement.\" \u0095 Tina Modotti And The Mexican Renaissance will show at Helsinki City Art Museum from September 12-November 15. A book of the exhibition, with 80 reproductions, is published by Jean Michel Place and is available from www.jmplace.com.",

      "body": "<p>When Cardinal Thomas Winning departs his archdiocesan offices in Glasgow for one of his regular trips to Rome, he likes to leave the trappings of ecclesiastical seniority behind. While other cardinals in the holy city can be identified by the splash of scarlet which peeks from below their dog collars, Winning favours an unremarkable black suit and the anonymity of a plain white band. </p> <p>On any of these visits it is not uncommon to find the cardinal socialising in the bars and trattorias, mixing with Catholic clergy from across the world. He is an affable, rather charming man, and priests, unaware that they are in the presence of a prince of their church, often gravitate towards his easy conversation. Occasionally the cardinal allows them to gossip, dropping little snippets of church tittle-tattle and speculation before him. He listens intently, face blank. Then, just past the crucial moment, one of his aides introduces his eminence. Red faces and ring-kissing follow. </p> <p>The cardinal appears rather to relish the shock he has created. It is a trait to be found on an altogether larger scale in his public life. There can be few clergymen this century who have even come close to issuing as many explosive moral jolts as Cardinal Thomas Joseph Winning. The headlines speak for themselves. The cardinal's proclamations on everything from the danger of modern-day Britons becoming \"spiritual dwarfs\", through Prince Charles's \"woolly\" views on Christianity, to the \"utter failure\" that is the Scottish parliament, keep the Scottish press busy on an almost weekly basis - and the London-based media too, when he hits the right buttons. </p> <p>This week, he condemned the government's chief medical officer's recommendation that clearance be given to the use of human embryos in stem cell research. In typically forthright - and populist - style the cardinal said this gave \"morally repugnant\" authorisation for a \"production line\" approach to human lives. </p> <p>Some commentators put this regular association with screaming headlines down to an uncontrollable propensity to shoot from the hip, as if Winning wields some sort of smoking moral gun - hidden within his crosier - that he just can't help discharging. Those who know him, however, say the deliverance of the decrees owes more to careful strategy than chaotic release. </p> <p>\"He has a track record of making these statements and then backing off from the controversy. He is not prepared to brook criticism,\" says a Catholic who has known him since he was a parish priest. \"But they are not issued at random, they are nearly always discussed beforehand with the 'yes men' around him.\" </p> <p>It is there, though, behind the mirrored-glass walls of the archdiocese headquarters in Glasgow, that the discussions have a habit of ending. It is a trait which annoys Winning's more progressive clergy. \"There is no machinery for consultation, there is no point along the way where the hierarchy is forced to listen,\" says Father John Fitzsimmons, parish priest at St John Bosco's in Erskine, Renfrewshire, and one of the few members of the clergy prepared to speak out publicly against the cardinal's conservatism. \"That style of leadership suppresses free and open debate and can only be unhealthy.\" </p> <p>Winning is similarly remote with the media. Once he has planted his moral explosive, calls to his press team are met with brick-wall answers such as \"the cardinal has made his position clear on that\". The cardinal is never available to defend his position. For a man who generates so many column inches, he rarely grants interviews and he declined to elaborate on his thoughts for this profile. \"He only gives interviews when he has something to say,\" said Ronnie Convery, his press aide. </p> <p>To Winning, the church is everything. He is utterly devout and certain of his faith, not just in God but in Catholic doctrine. He does not question Rome's certainties and he has difficulty seeing why anyone else should. \"Cardinal Winning believes absolutely in the teachings of the Catholic church: there's right and wrong, that's it,\" says Eddie Barnes, editor of the Scottish Catholic Observer. \"There are problems with communication and the way he deals with the media, but, ultimately, he believes it is his job to make sure Catholics know where the church stands, and not to get involved in drawn-out arguments.\" </p> <p>It is an aim he achieves with more than a measure of panache. In Rome, the conservative hierarchy which surrounds the current pontiff, Pope John Paul II, is pleased with the way the Scottish cardinal runs his moral crusade. Winning's own bishops, too, unite behind him - although some are understood to be occasionally irritated at being bounced into the latest round of publicity with no consultation or warning. This unity is also not entirely harmonious: even the cardinal's friends concede he does not tolerate disobedience, while his harshest critics accuse him of dominating his bishops, listening to them only when they hint at open revolt. They offer little public dissent, however, and it is only in the pews, among his 750,000-strong Catholic flock and beyond, that the cardinal cannot be certain of solid support. \"His statements are totally off the wall,\" says Father Fitzsimmons. \"Tom Winning should not be deceived into thinking he can open his mouth and everyone will fall into place. Many in the church are dismayed by his recent performance. They have to go out and make the church credible while he makes it appear more and more extreme.\" </p> <p>Catholic church attendance is down as it is across the Christian faiths; the number of Catholic marriages is also falling; most Catholics use contraception, despite the cardinal's vocal condemnation; and surveys show that most believe in abortion in exceptional circumstances - rape, severe abnormality of the foetus - spurning Winning's view that it is akin to the Dunblane massacre. </p> <p>The position of Catholicism in the west of Scotland, an area of which the cardinal is so much the product, has changed immeasurably since he was a young man. The sectarianism has diminished, Catholics now hold positions of power, the Catholic church is no longer so central to communities, even the notion that children must attend schools dictated by their religious denomination is perceptibly on the wane. </p> <p>Yet it is the traits and idiosyncrasies of the old west of Scotland that mark the cardinal - and the best clues to the cleric perhaps lie there. He was born on June 3 1925 in Lanarkshire. By present-day standards they were undoubtedly impoverished beginnings. Craigneuk, his home town, was a bleak place where steel and mining provided the only reliable mainstay of family incomes. </p> <p>His father, Thomas, though, reaped none of the modest material gain offered by the dirty, industrial giants: at various stages he was both a miner and a steel worker but by the time his first child was born he was unemployed and would remain so for 15 years. Home for his family was a basic two rooms and kitchen; cramped conditions for Winning, his parents and, later, his sister, Margaret, to live under, but they were no worse than those of neighbours and undoubtedly better than those in nearby Glasgow's slums. </p> <p>Whatever the poverty, it went unnoticed by the young Winning. His mother, he has said, managed the purse strings well and his father steered the family safely through the worst ravages of the Depression by making and selling sweets. The poverty was also accompanied by a characteristic common to many of the west of Scotland's working class of that era: a steely parental determination to get something better for the children. </p> <p>As Winning grew up, there was always the steadfast constancy of Roman Catholicism, as immutable a part of the family's life as the slag heaps and pit winding gear which dotted the countryside around them. By the age of 10, Winning was an altar boy, assisting at morning mass, preparing communion amid the scent of incense and the sound of Latin, before heading off to the local Catholic school. Only gradually did he realise that he wanted to be a priest. There was no great sign or epiphany; if anything his vocation seems to have sprung as much from the practical as the spiritual. He is a very practical sort of Catholic - a trait, perhaps, which fires his politicism - and he says it was watching priests at work in the community that persuaded him he wanted to join the priesthood. </p> <p>Those were the days when religious tribalism in the west of Scotland was at its most unpalatable. In public life and in the workplace, Catholics had to put up with appalling discrimination. Careers were closed to them simply because of their faith; in other professions they would be allowed a foot in the door, but would never rise above a certain rank. </p> <p>The sectarianism was more prevalent on a mundane level. In the rough communities of Lanarkshire, religion was a defining marker - and the religious bigotry of adults filtered down to children. When Winning was a schoolboy, it was routine for boys to stop other children in the street and ask whether they were Catholic or Protestant. The wrong answered resulted in a kicking. Winning was as prone to these unsolicited inquiries as any other child, but, despite the gradual realisation of his vocation, he took a pragmatic line. \"Many's the time I denied my faith to get to school on time,\" he said. </p> <p>He may have taken the easiest way out on those occasions, but the memory of discrimination against Catholics is something he carried with him to later life. It, and the poverty he witnessed as a child, no doubt lie behind his vocal fight against social injustice. </p> <p>In 1946, he left Lanarkshire to travel to Rome across a Europe desolated by war. It was a hellish three-day train journey and, when he, and 33 other seminarians, arrived at the Pontifical Scots College in the Piazza di Trevi, they found it boarded up, having been closed for almost a decade while the Vatican and Mussolini accommodated each other. Winning was not a natural scholar, but he worked hard and soon mastered fluent Italian and enviable Latin. (He once refined his skills in the latter by translating the match reports of his beloved Celtic football team.) </p> <p>At the Scots College, his unconventionality was soon apparent. When the seminarians were asked if it was ever correct to cheat the system, everyone wrote no - save Winning. He argued that extreme poverty made it justifiable. It is a position he still holds, to the annoyance of various rent-a-quote MPs: \"If your children are going to be hungry, if you get to the stage of extreme hunger, anybody's property becomes yours, because you have a right to survive. You can break into a bread van and steal a loaf. It would not be immoral to do that,\" he has said. </p> <p>He has also criticised the withdrawal of student grants: \"This, in addition to the new burden of student fees, is, I would suggest, an alien concept to a Scotland which is proud of its tradition of free schooling and classless academic life.\" </p> <p>In 1948 he was ordained - his father had to sell the confectionery equipment to finance the family's trip to Rome to watch the ceremony in St John Lateran's Basilica - and the following year he returned to a Lanarkshire parish with a newly acquired taste in fine wines. To observers, it didn't take long to spot that Winning was going to be more than a parish priest. \"He is very good looking, very charming. People thought of him as the good-looking, untouchable Richard Chamberlain type. They wanted him to succeed and it was always obvious he was destined for higher office.\" says Rennie McOwan, Scottish correspondent for the Catholic weekly, the Tablet. </p> <p>Despite the good looks, Winning, unlike many priests, never had any trouble with women. He admits to finding the celibacy incumbent on all Catholic priests - save those who have switched over from the Church of England - at times difficult to bear, but he has always been a reserved, old-fashioned sort of cleric, and he has never allowed the non-clergy to get too close, particularly if they are women. </p> <p>The next major step in Winning's career came in 1961 when he was asked to return to Rome to become spiritual director of the Scots College. In the shadow of the Vatican he prospered. Although Winning has the conventional degrees, he admits he is not an intellectual. His favourite thing about school was \"Saturday\" and he has never written any heavyweight theological works. What he does have, however, is a lawyerly mind, and in Rome, that helped enormously. \"He is forceful and good with people, qualities that matter in the Vatican,\" says McOwan. Winning did not play the ecclesiastical politics of the Eternal City, but his straightforwardness shone. </p> <p>He made his name and good contacts, contacts which would prove invaluable in the deal which, in 1982, eventually brought him to the attention of the Pope whose visit to Scotland, the first pontifical visit to the country, tottered on the brink of collapse. Behind the scenes at the Vatican, a group of Latin American cardinals were manoeuvring to have the pontiff cancel his visit, claiming the Falklands war was a hurdle which could not be overcome. The Pope wanted to come to Scotland, but the Latin Americans said this would be interpreted as an insult to Argentina. </p> <p>Scotland's then cardinal, Cardinal Gray, was ailing, so Winning, along with Derek Worlock, then archbishop of Liverpool, travelled to Rome to mount a counterattack. Winning knew which ears to whisper in and a diplomatic compromise was reached: there would be a mass of reconciliation at St Peter's and the Pope would visit both countries. Winning's part in brokering the deal was noted by the Pope and his senior advisors. </p> <p>Twelve years later he had his reward - at least in part. In Rome, the Pope placed the red biretta on Winning's head and kissed the cheek of the new cardinal he had created, only the second resident in Scotland since the Reformation. Outside, Winning was met by the sort of incongruous scenes more commonly associated with the national football squad: saltire-waving, bagpipe-playing masses. St Peter's Square was awash with the tartan of 1500 pilgrims. </p> <p>\"You have always been what is called a man of the people,\" said the Pope. It is an image Winning's advisors are keen to cultivate. \"He is equally at home with royalty or chatting away to a wee guy standing at the back of the church,\" says Convery. In this common-touch vein, much has been made of his love for Celtic football club. Nestled among the opera CDs at his home on the southside of Glasgow, there's a cassette of Celtic football songs entitled Echoes Of The Jungle 95/96. At every home game the cardinal can be found in the stands of Parkhead, sitting beside his nephew and making use of his pensioner's season ticket. (Though he avoids Celtic and Rangers matches, disliking the blatant sectarianism.) </p> <p>The association with Celtic, however, does not please everyone. In the west of Scotland football still carries with it the taint of religious bigotry. Winning's advisors have occasionally tried to persuade him to stop going to matches in the interests of ecumenicalism. Perhaps understandably, he will have no truck with their argument. However some within his inner circle say this is not prompted solely by a love of his team, but also by a failure to realise that Celtic and the Catholic church are no longer inextricably linked. </p> <p>The low point came when he was still the archbishop of Glasgow and attempted to hold a Catholic church commemorative ceremony at Celtic Park. Although his bishops told him it was inappropriate, Winning continued to insist the football stadium was the best venue and only backed down when some of his clergy made it clear they would not attend. </p> <p>But if he is occasionally out of touch with the changing social tides of Scotland, no-one can accuse him of being naive. He has been cardinal for less than a decade, but under his control the Catholic church has become a vocal force. Tom Devine, Scotland's pre-eminent historian, says: \"It would have been unthinkable for a Roman Catholic prelate to have the confidence to say the things Winning does even two or three decades ago. Roman Catholicism is now regarded as mainstream, a fundamental move away from Scotland's Presbyterian social identity. The fact that he is taken seriously is a reflection of that historical change. I am not convinced, however, that it means the Roman Catholic church has more power.\" </p> <p>Whether he actually has power or not, Winning undoubtedly has influence. He has come closer than anyone else to accusing Tony Blair of outright hypocrisy on his stance on abortion. The battle between the two over the issue began in 1996 when a conversation between them and the then shadow Scottish secretary, George Robertson, turned to the subject. Blair said, as a Christian, that he was opposed to abortion, but he did not wish to enforce his views on other people. The cardinal replied by asking Blair in what other area of policy he applied this logic. Blair was flustered, but the meeting ended good naturedly enough. </p> <p>Around eight months later, Winning appeared on a BBC documentary accusing the prime minister of taking a \"sham\" stance on abortion. Blair's spokesman, Alastair Campbell, immediately called on some Scottish MPs to hit back at Winning. The cardinal was furious - he has a notoriously foul temper - and asked for a meeting with Blair. The relationship between the two has been frosty since and the cardinal often makes attacks on the Labour party. He has said: \"The embers of totalitarianism are not far from the surface of New Labour.\" </p> <p>On abortion, as in most things, Winning is hugely conservative. Surprisingly, though, his most famous and controversial tactic of launching a scheme which paid women to keep their babies received the praise of Germaine Greer for offering a real alternative. The cardinal was grateful for Greer's intervention. He noted \"she seemed gradually to be becoming more like other women rather than an outright feminist\". Until recently, it was Winning's immutable opposition to abortion, along with contraception, celibacy and women priests which most often took him into the newspapers. </p> <p>There are plenty in the church who disagree with his conservative stance, but most concede he is simply enforcing papal teaching. \"There is no cardinal who is not bound to the teachings of the church, it is his job to get them across,\" says Joseph Devine, Bishop of Motherwell. But then came Section 28. When the Scottish executive announced earlier this year that it planned to repeal the law which bans the promotion of the acceptability of homosexuality in schools, Winning waded in. He had become involved in politics before - condemning the Gulf war, or berating Labour for bashing the Scottish nationalists - but this was the first time he had taken such a blatant and provocatively hostile stand against the government. The cardinal attacked Scotland's first minister, Donald Dewar, over the proposed repeal and enraged equal rights campaigners, and many in his own church, when he said: \"It pains me to use the word perverted when discussing the homosexual act, but that is what it is.\" </p> <p>It was typical Winning, but, even within his own church, most thought he had gone too far. \"The cardinal was putting forward the church's teaching, but it was the intemperance of his words that infuriated the gay Catholic community,\" says Father John Breslin, a priest who works closely with Quest, a support group for gay Catholics. \"It is good for anyone in a position of authority to listen to those on the ground and I think there is maybe not enough listening happening just now.\" </p> <p>Winning, however, did not stop there. To the exasperation of the executive, he sent a letter of support to Brian Souter, the multi-millionaire businessman who spent at least \u00a31m of his own money financing a campaign and referendum to keep the clause. As the debate dipped to baser and baser levels, particularly in Scotland's main tabloids, it was exactly the sort of intervention the executive didn't need. </p> <p>A liberal Catholic source close to the Scottish cabinet says: \"I think what we are really saddened by is that we have a cardinal who is more concerned about sex than social justice. This was a piece of discriminatory legislation and, from the cardinal's own background, you would have thought he would have understood that. He attacks Labour because of issues around sexuality and ignores the work we do on child poverty. Everyone expected the parliament to bring a new enlightened Scotland, but there are still some unpleasant attitudes out there and we have to take them on.\" </p> <p>Although Winning is, at heart, probably still an Old Labour man, his relationship with New Labour has been glacial for some time and he moves ever closer towards the Scottish National party. Those who know him well say he has always secretly wanted an independent Scotland. In the past, he has certainly made allusions in that direction. During the bloody years which led to the end of apartheid in South Africa, he once said mass in Soweto. In his sermon he declared: \"You want freedom, we want freedom.\" Those around him say this was an only partially veiled expression of hope for an independent Scotland. </p> <p>The retiring SNP leader, Alex Salmond, is well aware that, through the sectarian hue which can colour west of Scotland politics, the SNP is still thought of as anti-Catholic: Catholics vote disproportionately for Labour, and Salmond has been keen to woo them. Before the Scottish parliamentary elections, Winning planned to help him. He wrote a pamphlet entitled Make Your Cross Count which was all but a ringing endorsement of the SNP. </p> <p>It did not, however, make it to the congregation in its original form. At least four bishops made it clear they would publicly distance themselves from the pamphlet if Winning did not moderate its stance away from the SNP. After around four redrafts, a compromise document was finally unveiled. </p> <p>Both Labour and the SNP know the vocal power of the cardinal. Since devolution his voice has become stronger. He neither wishes to be nor has the chance of becoming Pope and, at 75, he appears determined to make his last years count in Scotland. His critics say he has become overtly political, moving towards the SNP, because he believes the church would play a stronger role in an independent Scotland. Others say he is a hard-working man of conviction, who simply will not be silenced. \"He has an incredible staying power. He has an extraordinary commitment to the job which just seems to get stronger as he ages,\" says Bishop Devine. </p> <p>But as Winning, perhaps the most famous clergyman in the country, continues to dominate the nation's moral debates, there is a whisper coming from the pews. He undoubtedly leads Scotland's 750,000 Catholics, but whether he is representative of them is another question entirely. \"Does he speak for me? No he does not,\" says Father Fitzsimmons. \"He is, of course, entitled to these opinions, but they are not held by the Catholics I deal with day in, day out.\" </p> <p><strong>Life at a glance</strong></p> <p><strong> Thomas Joseph Winning </strong></p> <p><strong>Born: </strong> June 3 1925, Wishaw, Lanarkshire. </p> <p><strong> Educated: </strong> St. Patrick's Primary School, Shieldmuir, Lanarkshire; Our Lady's High School, Motherwell, Lanarkshire; St Peter's College, Glasgow; Pontifical Scots College, Rome; Gregorian University, Rome. </p> <p><strong> Church Career: </strong> Ordained priest, Rome, 1948; graduated doctor of canon law, Gregorian University, 1953; assistant priest, St. Mary's, Hamilton 1953-57; spiritual director, Pontifical Scots College, Rome, 1961-66; Parish priest, Saint Luke's, Motherwell, 1966-70; auxiliary bishop, archdiocese of Glasgow, 1971; Archbishop of Glasgow, 1974; created cardinal priest, November 26 1994, with title of S.

      "bodyText": "When Cardinal Thomas Winning departs his archdiocesan offices in Glasgow for one of his regular trips to Rome, he likes to leave the trappings of ecclesiastical seniority behind. While other cardinals in the holy city can be identified by the splash of scarlet which peeks from below their dog collars, Winning favours an unremarkable black suit and the anonymity of a plain white band. On any of these visits it is not uncommon to find the cardinal socialising in the bars and trattorias, mixing with Catholic clergy from across the world. He is an affable, rather charming man, and priests, unaware that they are in the presence of a prince of their church, often gravitate towards his easy conversation. Occasionally the cardinal allows them to gossip, dropping little snippets of church tittle-tattle and speculation before him. He listens intently, face blank. Then, just past the crucial moment, one of his aides introduces his eminence. Red faces and ring-kissing follow. The cardinal appears rather to relish the shock he has created. It is a trait to be found on an altogether larger scale in his public life. There can be few clergymen this century who have even come close to issuing as many explosive moral jolts as Cardinal Thomas Joseph Winning. The headlines speak for themselves. The cardinal's proclamations on everything from the danger of modern-day Britons becoming \"spiritual dwarfs\", through Prince Charles's \"woolly\" views on Christianity, to the \"utter failure\" that is the Scottish parliament, keep the Scottish press busy on an almost weekly basis - and the London-based media too, when he hits the right buttons. This week, he condemned the government's chief medical officer's recommendation that clearance be given to the use of human embryos in stem cell research. In typically forthright - and populist - style the cardinal said this gave \"morally repugnant\" authorisation for a \"production line\" approach to human lives. Some commentators put this regular association with screaming headlines down to an uncontrollable propensity to shoot from the hip, as if Winning wields some sort of smoking moral gun - hidden within his crosier - that he just can't help discharging. Those who know him, however, say the deliverance of the decrees owes more to careful strategy than chaotic release. \"He has a track record of making these statements and then backing off from the controversy. He is not prepared to brook criticism,\" says a Catholic who has known him since he was a parish priest. \"But they are not issued at random, they are nearly always discussed beforehand with the 'yes men' around him.\" It is there, though, behind the mirrored-glass walls of the archdiocese headquarters in Glasgow, that the discussions have a habit of ending. It is a trait which annoys Winning's more progressive clergy. \"There is no machinery for consultation, there is no point along the way where the hierarchy is forced to listen,\" says Father John Fitzsimmons, parish priest at St John Bosco's in Erskine, Renfrewshire, and one of the few members of the clergy prepared to speak out publicly against the cardinal's conservatism. \"That style of leadership suppresses free and open debate and can only be unhealthy.\" Winning is similarly remote with the media. Once he has planted his moral explosive, calls to his press team are met with brick-wall answers such as \"the cardinal has made his position clear on that\". The cardinal is never available to defend his position. For a man who generates so many column inches, he rarely grants interviews and he declined to elaborate on his thoughts for this profile. \"He only gives interviews when he has something to say,\" said Ronnie Convery, his press aide. To Winning, the church is everything. He is utterly devout and certain of his faith, not just in God but in Catholic doctrine. He does not question Rome's certainties and he has difficulty seeing why anyone else should. \"Cardinal Winning believes absolutely in the teachings of the Catholic church: there's right and wrong, that's it,\" says Eddie Barnes, editor of the Scottish Catholic Observer. \"There are problems with communication and the way he deals with the media, but, ultimately, he believes it is his job to make sure Catholics know where the church stands, and not to get involved in drawn-out arguments.\" It is an aim he achieves with more than a measure of panache. In Rome, the conservative hierarchy which surrounds the current pontiff, Pope John Paul II, is pleased with the way the Scottish cardinal runs his moral crusade. Winning's own bishops, too, unite behind him - although some are understood to be occasionally irritated at being bounced into the latest round of publicity with no consultation or warning. This unity is also not entirely harmonious: even the cardinal's friends concede he does not tolerate disobedience, while his harshest critics accuse him of dominating his bishops, listening to them only when they hint at open revolt. They offer little public dissent, however, and it is only in the pews, among his 750,000-strong Catholic flock and beyond, that the cardinal cannot be certain of solid support. \"His statements are totally off the wall,\" says Father Fitzsimmons. \"Tom Winning should not be deceived into thinking he can open his mouth and everyone will fall into place. Many in the church are dismayed by his recent performance. They have to go out and make the church credible while he makes it appear more and more extreme.\" Catholic church attendance is down as it is across the Christian faiths; the number of Catholic marriages is also falling; most Catholics use contraception, despite the cardinal's vocal condemnation; and surveys show that most believe in abortion in exceptional circumstances - rape, severe abnormality of the foetus - spurning Winning's view that it is akin to the Dunblane massacre. The position of Catholicism in the west of Scotland, an area of which the cardinal is so much the product, has changed immeasurably since he was a young man. The sectarianism has diminished, Catholics now hold positions of power, the Catholic church is no longer so central to communities, even the notion that children must attend schools dictated by their religious denomination is perceptibly on the wane. Yet it is the traits and idiosyncrasies of the old west of Scotland that mark the cardinal - and the best clues to the cleric perhaps lie there. He was born on June 3 1925 in Lanarkshire.

Whatever the poverty, it went unnoticed by the young Winning. His mother, he has said, managed the purse strings well and his father steered the family safely through the worst ravages of the Depression by making and selling sweets. The poverty was also accompanied by a characteristic common to many of the west of Scotland's working class of that era: a steely parental determination to get something better for the children. As Winning grew up, there was always the steadfast constancy of Roman Catholicism, as immutable a part of the family's life as the slag heaps and pit winding gear which dotted the countryside around them. By the age of 10, Winning was an altar boy, assisting at morning mass, preparing communion amid the scent of incense and the sound of Latin, before heading off to the local Catholic school. Only gradually did he realise that he wanted to be a priest. There was no great sign or epiphany; if anything his vocation seems to have sprung as much from the practical as the spiritual. He is a very practical sort of Catholic - a trait, perhaps, which fires his politicism - and he says it was watching priests at work in the community that persuaded him he wanted to join the priesthood. Those were the days when religious tribalism in the west of Scotland was at its most unpalatable. In public life and in the workplace, Catholics had to put up with appalling discrimination. Careers were closed to them simply because of their faith; in other professions they would be allowed a foot in the door, but would never rise above a certain rank. The sectarianism was more prevalent on a mundane level. In the rough communities of Lanarkshire, religion was a defining marker - and the religious bigotry of adults filtered down to children. When Winning was a schoolboy, it was routine for boys to stop other children in the street and ask whether they were Catholic or Protestant. The wrong answered resulted in a kicking. Winning was as prone to these unsolicited inquiries as any other child, but, despite the gradual realisation of his vocation, he took a pragmatic line. \"Many's the time I denied my faith to get to school on time,\" he said. He may have taken the easiest way out on those occasions, but the memory of discrimination against Catholics is something he carried with him to later life. It, and the poverty he witnessed as a child, no doubt lie behind his vocal fight against social injustice. In 1946, he left Lanarkshire to travel to Rome across a Europe desolated by war. It was a hellish three-day train journey and, when he, and 33 other seminarians, arrived at the Pontifical Scots College in the Piazza di Trevi, they found it boarded up, having been closed for almost a decade while the Vatican and Mussolini accommodated each other.

He has also criticised the withdrawal of student grants: \"This, in addition to the new burden of student fees, is, I would suggest, an alien concept to a Scotland which is proud of its tradition of free schooling and classless academic life.\" In 1948 he was ordained - his father had to sell the confectionery equipment to finance the family's trip to Rome to watch the ceremony in St John Lateran's Basilica - and the following year he returned to a Lanarkshire parish with a newly acquired taste in fine wines. To observers, it didn't take long to spot that Winning was going to be more than a parish priest. \"He is very good looking, very charming.

The battle between the two over the issue began in 1996 when a conversation between them and the then shadow Scottish secretary, George Robertson, turned to the subject. Blair said, as a Christian, that he was opposed to abortion, but he did not wish to enforce his views on other people. The cardinal replied by asking Blair in what other area of policy he applied this logic. Blair was flustered, but the meeting ended good naturedly enough. Around eight months later, Winning appeared on a BBC documentary accusing the prime minister of taking a \"sham\" stance on abortion. Blair's spokesman, Alastair Campbell, immediately called on some Scottish MPs to hit back at Winning. The cardinal was furious - he has a notoriously foul temper - and asked for a meeting with Blair. The relationship between the two has been frosty since and the cardinal often makes attacks on the Labour party. He has said: \"The embers of totalitarianism are not far from the surface of New Labour.\" On abortion, as in most things, Winning is hugely conservative. Surprisingly, though, his most famous and controversial tactic of launching a scheme which paid women to keep their babies received the praise of Germaine Greer for offering a real alternative. The cardinal was grateful for Greer's intervention. He noted \"she seemed gradually to be becoming more like other women rather than an outright feminist\". Until recently, it was Winning's immutable opposition to abortion, along with contraception, celibacy and women priests which most often took him into the newspapers. There are plenty in the church who disagree with his conservative stance, but most concede he is simply enforcing papal teaching. \"There is no cardinal who is not bound to the teachings of the church, it is his job to get them across,\" says Joseph Devine, Bishop of Motherwell. But then came Section 28. When the Scottish executive announced earlier this year that it planned to repeal the law which bans the promotion of the acceptability of homosexuality in schools, Winning waded in. He had become involved in politics before - condemning the Gulf war, or berating Labour for bashing the Scottish nationalists - but this was the first time he had taken such a blatant and provocatively hostile stand against the government. The cardinal attacked Scotland's first minister, Donald Dewar, over the proposed repeal and enraged equal rights campaigners, and many in his own church, when he said: \"It pains me to use the word perverted when discussing the homosexual act, but that is what it is.\" It was typical Winning, but, even within his own church, most thought he had gone too far. \"The cardinal was putting forward the church's teaching, but it was the intemperance of his words that infuriated the gay Catholic community,\" says Father John Breslin, a priest who works closely with Quest, a support group for gay Catholics. \"It is good for anyone in a position of authority to listen to those on the ground and I think there is maybe not enough listening happening just now.\" Winning, however, did not stop there. To the exasperation of the executive, he sent a letter of support to Brian Souter, the multi-millionaire businessman who spent at least \u00a31m of his own money financing a campaign and referendum to keep the clause. As the debate dipped to baser and baser levels, particularly in Scotland's main tabloids, it was exactly the sort of intervention the executive didn't need. A liberal Catholic source close to the Scottish cabinet says: \"I think what we are really saddened by is that we have a cardinal who is more concerned about sex than social justice. This was a piece of discriminatory legislation and, from the cardinal's own background, you would have thought he would have understood that. He attacks Labour because of issues around sexuality and ignores the work we do on child poverty. Everyone expected the parliament to bring a new enlightened Scotland, but there are still some unpleasant attitudes out there and we have to take them on.\" Although Winning is, at heart, probably still an Old Labour man, his relationship with New Labour has been glacial for some time and he moves ever closer towards the Scottish National party. Those who know him well say he has always secretly wanted an independent Scotland. In the past, he has certainly made allusions in that direction. During the bloody years which led to the end of apartheid in South Africa, he once said mass in Soweto. In his sermon he declared: \"You want freedom, we want freedom.\" Those around him say this was an only partially veiled expression of hope for an independent Scotland. The retiring SNP leader, Alex Salmond, is well aware that, through the sectarian hue which can colour west of Scotland politics, the SNP is still thought of as anti-Catholic: Catholics vote disproportionately for Labour, and Salmond has been keen to woo them. Before the Scottish parliamentary elections, Winning planned to help him. He wrote a pamphlet entitled Make Your Cross Count which was all but a ringing endorsement of the SNP. It did not, however, make it to the congregation in its original form. At least four bishops made it clear they would publicly distance themselves from the pamphlet if Winning did not moderate its stance away from the SNP. After around four redrafts, a compromise document was finally unveiled. Both Labour and the SNP know the vocal power of the cardinal. Since devolution his voice has become stronger. He neither wishes to be nor has the chance of becoming Pope and, at 75, he appears determined to make his last years count in Scotland. His critics say he has become overtly political, moving towards the SNP, because he believes the church would play a stronger role in an independent Scotland. Others say he is a hard-working man of conviction, who simply will not be silenced. \"He has an incredible staying power. He has an extraordinary commitment to the job which just seems to get stronger as he ages,\" says Bishop Devine. But as Winning, perhaps the most famous clergyman in the country, continues to dominate the nation's moral debates, there is a whisper coming from the pews. He undoubtedly leads Scotland's 750,000 Catholics, but whether he is representative of them is another question entirely. \"Does he speak for me? No he does not,\" says Father Fitzsimmons. \"He is, of course, entitled to these opinions, but they are not held by the Catholics I deal with day in, day out.\" Life at a glance Thomas Joseph Winning Born: June 3 1925, Wishaw, Lanarkshire.

      "body": "<p>I felt Manchester United had two or three gears to go up during the Charity Shield but I still reckon the outcome at Wembley was a pointer for the season. And that means Chelsea as Premiership champions with United runners-up. </p> <p>I see Gianluca Vialli's team as a major force not so much because of Sunday's game but on the basis of the balance in the side. Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink and Mario Stanic will give more power and goals potential, and I like the look of Hasselbaink a lot. </p> <p>He's quick, he plays against the last man and his link-up play is tidier than it was before he moved to Spain. So he not only gives Chelsea a new option but can also join in the possession football they enjoy. As for Stanic, he's technically sound and excellent in the air, and I expect him to get in at the far stick and score headers. </p> <p>If there is one area where Chelsea might be short of top-drawer balance it's in the centre of midfield, although I see an obvious solution. To my mind Dennis Wise needs someone different alongside him, and I'm convinced Mario Melchiot would do a sensational job. He could do what Patrick Vieira does for Arsenal. </p> <p>I've seen Melchiot play twice as a right-back at Wembley and he impressed me a lot. He's powerful, tidy and showed against United that he can score. With Christian Panucci and Albert Ferrer able to step into that full-back position I would move Melchiot into midfield. From what I understand he's not only played a lot there but prefers it. </p> <p>Of the other factors that point towards Chelsea, their qualification for the Uefa Cup rather than the Champions League is significant. That means not only fewer games and potentially easier draws in Europe to start with, allowing Vialli to rest a few, but provides a different focus.

      "bodyText": "I felt Manchester United had two or three gears to go up during the Charity Shield but I still reckon the outcome at Wembley was a pointer for the season. And that means Chelsea as Premiership champions with United runners-up. I see Gianluca Vialli's team as a major force not so much because of Sunday's game but on the basis of the balance in the side. Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink and Mario Stanic will give more power and goals potential, and I like the look of Hasselbaink a lot. He's quick, he plays against the last man and his link-up play is tidier than it was before he moved to Spain. So he not only gives Chelsea a new option but can also join in the possession football they enjoy. As for Stanic, he's technically sound and excellent in the air, and I expect him to get in at the far stick and score headers. If there is one area where Chelsea might be short of top-drawer balance it's in the centre of midfield, although I see an obvious solution. To my mind Dennis Wise needs someone different alongside him, and I'm convinced Mario Melchiot would do a sensational job. He could do what Patrick Vieira does for Arsenal. I've seen Melchiot play twice as a right-back at Wembley and he impressed me a lot. He's powerful, tidy and showed against United that he can score. With Christian Panucci and Albert Ferrer able to step into that full-back position I would move Melchiot into midfield. From what I understand he's not only played a lot there but prefers it. Of the other factors that point towards Chelsea, their qualification for the Uefa Cup rather than the Champions League is significant. That means not only fewer games and potentially easier draws in Europe to start with, allowing Vialli to rest a few, but provides a different focus. It is the Premiership that really matters now. Last season Marcel Desailly didn't always seem to be focused on the mundane league matches, and for me he is the barometer of this Chelsea side.

As before, a win earns 12 points , a tie 6 , a normal draw 4 (see later *) and a defeat none, plus any bonus points accrued for batting and bowling in each first innings. Bonus points are now reckoned on the score in the first 130 overs, not 120 overs as in recent seasons. Batting: now 5 pts can be earned (4 last year) 200 -249 runs (1pt); 250-299 (2); 300-349 (3); 350-399 (4); 400 or over (5) Bowling: now only 3 points available (4) three-five wickets (1); six-eight wickets (2); nine-ten (3). The new ball can still be taken after 100 overs. A no ball is worth two runs to the batting side; runs scored off a no ball count in addition to the two-run penalty. A single-innings match may be played when bad weather prevents any start until less than eight hours remain. A win earns 12 points, a tie six and a draw three but there are no bonus points. SECOND XI CHAMPIONSHIP Dunstable: Essex 271 and 217-4 dec. Northamptonshire 117 and 69-5. Match drawn. Hastings: Sussex 318 and 381-7 dec. Kent 340 and 182 (P S Lazenbury 59; Taylor 4-33).

      "body": "<p>When Michael Bevan dropped a sitter off South Africa's Mark Boucher in Melbourne yesterday, he did not merely cost Australia victory. By dislocating a knuckle, he may well have scuppered <strong> Sussex</strong>'s prospects of promotion. </p> <p>The less than impeccable timing of Bevan's absence and injury - his championship average is 78 - was rammed home at Eastbourne yesterday. Resuming on 45 for seven with a further - not to say improbable - 183 required to deny the Second Division leaders <strong> Northamptonshire </strong> a fourth successive win, Chris Adams and Nick Wilton extended their alliance to 36 before Paul Taylor defeated the wicketkeeper and Jason Lewry with consecutive balls. </p> <p>Mark Robinson resisted for 10 deliveries before Taylor earned the distinction of being the first bowler in this season's championship to dismiss the erstwhile duffer's duffer. The veteran left-armer finished with six for 27 as Sussex folded for 65 to complete a second thumping defeat by Northants in six days. </p> <p>Adams did his manful best to fill the Bevan void. Unbowed on 24, his match haul was 108 runs off 221 balls; colleagues combined for 319 balls and 85 runs. </p> <p>When Bobby Simpson took up the coaching reins at <strong> Lancashire </strong> last winter, the scent of a first outright pennant since the Depression became a heady whiff. All the more reason, then, to appreciate the extent of the angst that has accompanied the club's subsequent fitfulness. </p> <p>Sourav Ganguly has proved a less than adequate replacement for Muttiah Muralitharan but, more pertinently, Simpson's charges have missed the experience and steadiness of Peter Martin. </p> <p>Fortunately, after missing two months with a hand injury, the former England seamer is making a timely and fruitful comeback. </p> <p>At Old Trafford, Matty Walker and Alan Wells helped hoist <strong> Kent</strong> from 14 for four to 127 for five but the last five men went for 28, Martin taking five for 42 for a lead of 80. The quicks, inevitably, continued to hold sway, Lancashire stumbling to 43 for six as David Masters affirmed his candidacy for an A tour. </p> <p>Then up popped that faithful retainer Neil Fairbrother, doubling the score in harness with Chris Schofield and probably settling the outcome. </p> <p><strong> Yorkshire</strong> , meanwhile, could only watch the rain fall on Grace Road where their match against <strong> Leicestershire</strong> was a wash-out.</p>",

      "bodyText": "When Michael Bevan dropped a sitter off South Africa's Mark Boucher in Melbourne yesterday, he did not merely cost Australia victory. By dislocating a knuckle, he may well have scuppered Sussex's prospects of promotion. The less than impeccable timing of Bevan's absence and injury - his championship average is 78 - was rammed home at Eastbourne yesterday. Resuming on 45 for seven with a further - not to say improbable - 183 required to deny the Second Division leaders Northamptonshire a fourth successive win, Chris Adams and Nick Wilton extended their alliance to 36 before Paul Taylor defeated the wicketkeeper and Jason Lewry with consecutive balls. Mark Robinson resisted for 10 deliveries before Taylor earned the distinction of being the first bowler in this season's championship to dismiss the erstwhile duffer's duffer. The veteran left-armer finished with six for 27 as Sussex folded for 65 to complete a second thumping defeat by Northants in six days. Adams did his manful best to fill the Bevan void. Unbowed on 24, his match haul was 108 runs off 221 balls; colleagues combined for 319 balls and 85 runs. When Bobby Simpson took up the coaching reins at Lancashire last winter, the scent of a first outright pennant since the Depression became a heady whiff. All the more reason, then, to appreciate the extent of the angst that has accompanied the club's subsequent fitfulness. Sourav Ganguly has proved a less than adequate replacement for Muttiah Muralitharan but, more pertinently, Simpson's charges have missed the experience and steadiness of Peter Martin. Fortunately, after missing two months with a hand injury, the former England seamer is making a timely and fruitful comeback. At Old Trafford, Matty Walker and Alan Wells helped hoist Kent from 14 for four to 127 for five but the last five men went for 28, Martin taking five for 42 for a lead of 80. The quicks, inevitably, continued to hold sway, Lancashire stumbling to 43 for six as David Masters affirmed his candidacy for an A tour. Then up popped that faithful retainer Neil Fairbrother, doubling the score in harness with Chris Schofield and probably settling the outcome. Yorkshire , meanwhile, could only watch the rain fall on Grace Road where their match against Leicestershire was a wash-out.",
