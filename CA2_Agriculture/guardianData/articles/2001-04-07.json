Chants of 'what a load of rubbish' assailed the Pompey players after they had been outplayed by a bolder, more methodical Nottingham Forest in the first half. </p> <p>Chris Bart-Williams took his two goals calmly and there was no denying the visitors' superiority in all departments after a shaky start on the soaked surface. </p> <p>The match almost did not go ahead and an inspection 90 minutes before the kick-off by referee Roger Furnandiz allowed it to go ahead only on the condition that there was no more rain. Luckily for Forest, the rain stayed away. </p> <p>Portsmouth went into the match with 10 key players injured and striker Lee Bradbury completing a suspension, while Forest brought back the influential Andy Johnson after their midweek defeat at Watford. </p> <p>Forest could thank a referee's assistant for their opening goal after 11 minutes, the linesman spotting a handball by Scott Hiley as he slid into a challenge by David Johnson.

      "bodyText": "Nottingham Forest revived their promotion challenge with this comprehensive victory, putting behind them a run in which they had gained only one point from four matches and nudging Portsmouth a step nearer the relegation zone. The home supporters were not slow to voice their disapproval. Chants of 'what a load of rubbish' assailed the Pompey players after they had been outplayed by a bolder, more methodical Nottingham Forest in the first half. Chris Bart-Williams took his two goals calmly and there was no denying the visitors' superiority in all departments after a shaky start on the soaked surface. The match almost did not go ahead and an inspection 90 minutes before the kick-off by referee Roger Furnandiz allowed it to go ahead only on the condition that there was no more rain. Luckily for Forest, the rain stayed away. Portsmouth went into the match with 10 key players injured and striker Lee Bradbury completing a suspension, while Forest brought back the influential Andy Johnson after their midweek defeat at Watford. Forest could thank a referee's assistant for their opening goal after 11 minutes, the linesman spotting a handball by Scott Hiley as he slid into a challenge by David Johnson. Bart-Williams converted from the spot. Portsmouth should have equalised in the 24th minute when Lee Mills was played through, but the onrushing Dave Beasant belied his 42 years by blocking the shot with his legs. Forest scored again with a goal of great simplicity after 37 minutes. A Portsmouth move broke down inside their own half and with two visiting attackers confronted by only one defender, the Trinidadian striker Stern John struck the post and Bart-Williams had no problem in netting the rebound. Portsmouth manager Graham Rix made a double change at the interval, sending on Mike Panopoulos and Luke Nightingale, but there was little difference either to the way Portsmouth played or their shape. Forest allowed Portsmouth plenty of possession but Pompey failed to make much use of it. Mills, still smarting from his miss in the first half, shot against the goalkeeper's feet after 49 minutes and the pace of Lovell twice took him into scoring positions, only to be thwarted by the alert Beasant. Bart-Williams shot over the bar with seven minutes remaining when a hat-trick beckoned and although Portsmouth forced 12 corners the result was never in doubt. After the initial euphoria which greeted the appointment of Rix, the reality of an uncomfortable past month now confronts him and the Portsmouth fans were again not slow to voice their anger at the final whistle",

Poom again came to Derby's rescue with a flying save from Hasselbaink, and really it was no more than Chelsea deserved when they went ahead after 63 minutes. Hasselbaink took on Horacio Carbonari on the outside before pulling the ball back into the path of Zola who found the bottom corner of the net from a dozen yards. Chelsea underlined their superiority with three goals in the last six minutes. Hasselbaink became the first Chelsea players since Kerry Dixon 11 years ago to score 20 goals in a season in the top flight when he converted from Poyet's pass. Poyet then drove low into the net from a Dennis Wise corner and in injury time a glancing header by the Uruguayan from Celestine Babayaro's cross made it 4-0.",

When Birt was appointed last summer to cast a 'fresh eye' over the criminal justice system, Blair insisted that he could bring 'a strategic outlook and an understanding of social trends gained from a long and distinguished career in broadcasting'. Critics on both sides of the House, however, were sceptical, accusing Blair of simply giving a good friend a job. Privately, there was scorn within the Home Office and even within Downing Street at his appointment. Ministers have been careful to be courteous to Blair's personal envoy - Birt met Straw for talks shortly before Christmas, and has also had meetings with the Lord Chancellor, Lord Irvine, both Irvine's junior Ministers and drugs tsar Keith Hellawell. However, insiders say he was in effect limited to poring over the Offenders' Index - records of crime statistics for the past 50 years - in an attempt to discern trends.

      "body": "<p>Insurers are at loggerheads with an influential committee of MPs over their enthusiasm for genetic testing. Companies now face a ban on the use of information from genetic tests because of fears they may create a genetic underclass. </p> <p>The Commons Science and Technology Select Committee has recommended a two-year moratorium on the use of all positive genetic tests. If insurers refuse to stop using test results voluntarily, the Government should introduce legislation to force a moratorium. </p> <p>The committee has also recommended that the Government insurance industry collaborate to provide an alternative form of insurance for those who would otherwise be denied cover because of their genetic make-up. </p> <p>In a report published last week, the committee said a decision by the Association of British Insurers that several of the tests it recommended four years ago are no longer valid 'casts the gravest possible doubts' on those still used by the firms. </p> <p>In a scathing attack on the industry, the committee said: 'Insurers appear to have been far more interested in establishing their future right to use genetic test results in assessing premiums than in whether or not they are reliable or relevant.' The ABI's code of practice bars companies from telling applicants to undergo genetic testing, but permits them to ask for the results of any tests they have already taken. </p> <p>Insurers claim that if they ignore the results of genetic tests, customers who know they risk developing a hereditary disease will be able to buy large amounts of insurance at the normal price. However, three insurers - Virgin Direct, Standard Life and the Cooperative Insurance Society - do not require applicants to reveal the results of genetic tests, arguing that the numbers involved are so small that their effect is negligible. </p> <p>In 1998 the ABI named 10 tests for seven conditions for which it believed there were reliable genetic tests, but reduced this to five tests for three conditions last year. Those left are for breast and ovarian cancer, Huntington's and early-onset Alzheimer's. </p> <p>Only one, for Huntington's disease, has received approval from the parliamentary Genetics and Insurance Committee so far, but most insurers are using the results of all five tests when assessing risk. The Science and Technology Select Committee says this should stop immediately.</p>",

Companies now face a ban on the use of information from genetic tests because of fears they may create a genetic underclass. The Commons Science and Technology Select Committee has recommended a two-year moratorium on the use of all positive genetic tests. If insurers refuse to stop using test results voluntarily, the Government should introduce legislation to force a moratorium. The committee has also recommended that the Government insurance industry collaborate to provide an alternative form of insurance for those who would otherwise be denied cover because of their genetic make-up. In a report published last week, the committee said a decision by the Association of British Insurers that several of the tests it recommended four years ago are no longer valid 'casts the gravest possible doubts' on those still used by the firms. In a scathing attack on the industry, the committee said: 'Insurers appear to have been far more interested in establishing their future right to use genetic test results in assessing premiums than in whether or not they are reliable or relevant.' The ABI's code of practice bars companies from telling applicants to undergo genetic testing, but permits them to ask for the results of any tests they have already taken. Insurers claim that if they ignore the results of genetic tests, customers who know they risk developing a hereditary disease will be able to buy large amounts of insurance at the normal price. However, three insurers - Virgin Direct, Standard Life and the Cooperative Insurance Society - do not require applicants to reveal the results of genetic tests, arguing that the numbers involved are so small that their effect is negligible. In 1998 the ABI named 10 tests for seven conditions for which it believed there were reliable genetic tests, but reduced this to five tests for three conditions last year. Those left are for breast and ovarian cancer, Huntington's and early-onset Alzheimer's. Only one, for Huntington's disease, has received approval from the parliamentary Genetics and Insurance Committee so far, but most insurers are using the results of all five tests when assessing risk. The Science and Technology Select Committee says this should stop immediately.",

However, there is worrying evidence that Abdallah's was simply the highest-profile example of an increasingly common type of fraud that is aided by the spread of electronic communications and affects thousands of ordinary people in Britain. </p> <p>Impersonation is the fastest rising category of crime tracked by <a href=\"http://www.cifas.org.uk\">Cifas</a> (the Credit Industry Fraud Avoidance System), which acts as an early warning system for banks, building societies and other financial institutions. In the period from January to October 1999, Cifas logged 1,572 cases of false identity fraud. Over the same months last year this number leapt to 8,739 - a rise of 456 per cent. </p> <p>The rise of impersonation fraud has so alarmed observers that it will be getting a special mention in the National Criminal Intelligence Service's annual UK Threat Assessment, to be published in July. </p> <p>'If this rate of increase continues,' says Cifas, 'this type of fraud will become the most serious, with significant financial losses within a short space of time.' </p> <p>Impersonation fraud is divided into piggy-backing, where the 'victim' colludes with the imposter, for example, fraudulently to collect benefits claims, and hijacking, where the victim is unaware of the identity of the impostor. It is the second variety, as practised by Abdallah on America's billionaire set, that appears to be driving the current boom in false identity, thanks to the increasing ease with which criminals can provide convincing fronts for themselves using modern technology. </p> <p>'They've always been there,' says a source at Cifas, 'but there's been an explosion in recent years. It relates to the distance of persons from service providers. With the growth of call centres, and the internet, the old days of a bank manager sitting across the desk from an applicant are long gone.' </p> <p>This anonymity is perfect for the identity hijacker. And becoming someone else is less of a problem than one might expect. Fleur Strong, of the National Criminal Intelligence Service, says: 'It's not that difficult to do and if you're not greedy, you won't necessarily get caught out.' </p> <p>Once a criminal has one item of personal information, such as the account details from a credit card slip, they can usually get hold of others that will help build up a full, false identity. Items such as addresses and phone numbers can be found on the internet, and government organisations do not cross-reference applications for identity documents such as driving licences. </p> <p>Equifax and Experian, the major UK credit reference agencies, will provide personal credit information for little more than a \u00a32 fee. Furthermore, says Strong: 'You can be pumped for a lot of information if you are just chatting with someone. People will happily give out details like their mother's maiden name to someone they met in a pub or club.' All the criminal needs is a delivery address they can claim the victim has moved to, and they are ready to start making credit card and bank account applications on the victim's behalf. </p> <p>In theory, if the ruse is carried out carefully enough, the victim might never know. And, since impersonation per se is not a crime, if the fraudster kept credit card payments up to date it is technically possible they would not even be liable to prosecution. </p> <p>If the fraud is discovered, the onus is on the party that has suffered a material loss, usually the bank or credit card issuer, to push for prosecution. They are also obliged to notify Cifas, which then posts an alert against the victim's credit file to make sure that all future applications in that name are checked with its legitimate holder. </p> <p>Banks claim they are bracing themselves for a potential wave of identity hijackers. Heather Scott, corporate communications manager at Intelligent Finance, says: 'We believe we do all we're regulated to, and more besides. Our people recognise that where there's no face-to-face contact, there's a greater risk of this kind of fraud, so we go to greater lengths to make sure we deal with it. Our systems have been built to be as robust as the technology will allow.' </p> <p>But Richard Tyson-Davies, head of public affairs for the credit card body Apacs, says fraudulent applications are a minor concern for the industry, compared to annual losses of \u00a3100 million through counterfeit cards. </p> <p>He says the level of fraudulent applications dropped by 10 per cent last year, while credit card fraud overall went up by 55 per cent. </p> <p>This, combined with the Cifas figures, could be an indication that Cifas is helping to intercept an increasing number of imposters and cutting the level of reported application fraud. </p> <p>However, Cifas says that while its service is important, 'individual companies need to do verification checks, and there is a trade-off between these and the speed of the production line'. </p> <p><strong>My credit card took a \u00a33,800 hit</strong></p> <p>David Vindel, 31, of west London, opened his Christmas statement from MBNA, an American credit card issuer in the UK, to find an unexplained \u00a33,800 against his account. </p> <p>The amount was for an MBNA cheque, which the card company regularly issues to customers to pay off household bills and other costs. 'I've never used one of their cheques,' he says, 'so I contacted them, and their fraud department said they would try to get the cheque back for verification.'</p> <p>MBNA said this would take two weeks, but it took twice that time. While the amount was in dispute, the bank continued to charge him interest.</p> <p>At the same time, further evidence showed an identity hijacker was at work. MBNA intercepted another cheque, this time for \u00a32,500, and Vindel received a welcome pack from Intelligent Finance, the Halifax-backed internet bank, for a bogus account in his name. With the pack, IF returned a fake payslip in Vindel's name, drawn against a non-existent company and quoting a non-existent tax code. Then followed a letter confirming a \u00a315,000 loan.</p> <p>While IF quickly made amends after he contacted them , and claims the welcome pack and loan were pre-approved, subject to further checks - Vindel was frustrated by the lack of response from MBNA, which was still sending him new cheque books even though he had specifically requested not to receive them any more.</p> <p>'Every time I contacted them I had to explain my situation over again,' he says. 'I was charged interest for over three months.'</p> <p>Eventually he wrote directly to MBNA chief Greg Phillips and the dispute was settled in days. However, Vindel feels let down by the bank's keenness to offer credit and its relaxed attitude to fraud.</p> <p>An MBNA spokesman said that the company was taking his concerns 'very seriously' and would be reviewing its procedures.</p>",

And becoming someone else is less of a problem than one might expect. Fleur Strong, of the National Criminal Intelligence Service, says: 'It's not that difficult to do and if you're not greedy, you won't necessarily get caught out.' Once a criminal has one item of personal information, such as the account details from a credit card slip, they can usually get hold of others that will help build up a full, false identity. Items such as addresses and phone numbers can be found on the internet, and government organisations do not cross-reference applications for identity documents such as driving licences. Equifax and Experian, the major UK credit reference agencies, will provide personal credit information for little more than a \u00a32 fee. Furthermore, says Strong: 'You can be pumped for a lot of information if you are just chatting with someone. People will happily give out details like their mother's maiden name to someone they met in a pub or club.' All the criminal needs is a delivery address they can claim the victim has moved to, and they are ready to start making credit card and bank account applications on the victim's behalf. In theory, if the ruse is carried out carefully enough, the victim might never know. And, since impersonation per se is not a crime, if the fraudster kept credit card payments up to date it is technically possible they would not even be liable to prosecution. If the fraud is discovered, the onus is on the party that has suffered a material loss, usually the bank or credit card issuer, to push for prosecution. They are also obliged to notify Cifas, which then posts an alert against the victim's credit file to make sure that all future applications in that name are checked with its legitimate holder. Banks claim they are bracing themselves for a potential wave of identity hijackers. Heather Scott, corporate communications manager at Intelligent Finance, says: 'We believe we do all we're regulated to, and more besides. Our people recognise that where there's no face-to-face contact, there's a greater risk of this kind of fraud, so we go to greater lengths to make sure we deal with it. Our systems have been built to be as robust as the technology will allow.' But Richard Tyson-Davies, head of public affairs for the credit card body Apacs, says fraudulent applications are a minor concern for the industry, compared to annual losses of \u00a3100 million through counterfeit cards. He says the level of fraudulent applications dropped by 10 per cent last year, while credit card fraud overall went up by 55 per cent. This, combined with the Cifas figures, could be an indication that Cifas is helping to intercept an increasing number of imposters and cutting the level of reported application fraud. However, Cifas says that while its service is important, 'individual companies need to do verification checks, and there is a trade-off between these and the speed of the production line'. My credit card took a \u00a33,800 hit David Vindel, 31, of west London, opened his Christmas statement from MBNA, an American credit card issuer in the UK, to find an unexplained \u00a33,800 against his account. The amount was for an MBNA cheque, which the card company regularly issues to customers to pay off household bills and other costs. 'I've never used one of their cheques,' he says, 'so I contacted them, and their fraud department said they would try to get the cheque back for verification.' MBNA said this would take two weeks, but it took twice that time. While the amount was in dispute, the bank continued to charge him interest. At the same time, further evidence showed an identity hijacker was at work. MBNA intercepted another cheque, this time for \u00a32,500, and Vindel received a welcome pack from Intelligent Finance, the Halifax-backed internet bank, for a bogus account in his name. With the pack, IF returned a fake payslip in Vindel's name, drawn against a non-existent company and quoting a non-existent tax code. Then followed a letter confirming a \u00a315,000 loan. While IF quickly made amends after he contacted them , and claims the welcome pack and loan were pre-approved, subject to further checks - Vindel was frustrated by the lack of response from MBNA, which was still sending him new cheque books even though he had specifically requested not to receive them any more. 'Every time I contacted them I had to explain my situation over again,' he says. 'I was charged interest for over three months.' Eventually he wrote directly to MBNA chief Greg Phillips and the dispute was settled in days. However, Vindel feels let down by the bank's keenness to offer credit and its relaxed attitude to fraud. An MBNA spokesman said that the company was taking his concerns 'very seriously' and would be reviewing its procedures.",

It is, however, American collectors who drive the world market for superhero comic books, the lengthy stories aimed at adults, as opposed to the shorter ones for children. Until recently, it was the books themselves that drew the biggest bucks. But now the value of their pre-press artwork is rising. An original, unpublished page of Superman artwork from the Thirties recently fetched a record $77,000 at Sotheby's New York branch. Now original artworks by the brilliant 'new wave' of a dozen or so British-based artists who have drawn Dredd since he first blasted crimi nals to pieces in the IPC comic 2000AD in 1977 could rise in value. They used to be hurled into skips by publishers after use, but are now demanded back by the artists, whose work is about to be acknowledged by an exhibition at London's the Victoria and Albert Museum. The UK retail price for a black-and-white page of Dredd published in the past 10 years is still only \u00a360, though a page by an artist with a big following among Dredd fans, such as Brian Bolland or Mike McMahon, fetches \u00a3150. Something by Dredd's original designer, the Spaniard Carlos Ezquerra - who gave the judge his Greek-warrior crash helmet with medieval executioner's mask and Harley-Davidson motorbike - is worth between \u00a3200 and \u00a31,000, and more if it is a colour page from an early episode by Dredd's top scriptwriter, John Wagner. The work can be found in comic bookshops, at collectors' fairs, through mail auctions, on the internet, or direct from the artists. I bought a page from Brett Ewins, who has drawn Dredd for 16 years. A fellow collector, the animator Rufus Dayglo, showed me his treasure trove of 2,000 originals, mostly by fellow Dredd artists. Some of Dayglo's prized pieces will be shown in the exhibition, 'Art Droids 2000AD', in the Henry Cole wing of the V&amp;A from 31 May to 2 September. The works' potential value to collectors lies in the intrinsic quality of the art and in Dredd's growing reputation as an icon of popular culture. The British art that brought Dredd to life was more flamboyant than the staid realism of American comic book art. It was - still is - cinema compared with their photography, full of explosions of action and clever tricks using perspective and light. Dredd's artists were perfectionists, spending up to two days on a page, for which they were paid peanuts. Small wonder that in the Eighties, American publishers began to poach them.

Unlike Superman and Batman, he is not a sanctimonious do-gooder. He is a nasty character, lucky to have the law on his side. He is a product of unsettled times when there was popular demand for authoritarian political leadership. When Judge Dredd was thought up in 1977 by Pat Mills, then editor of 2000AD, unemployment and inflation in Britain were rising, the unions were dominant, mugging was a new word and Margaret Thatcher was two years away from becoming Prime Minister. Dredd, conceived as a future cop who shoots people for dropping litter, is the most feared of a regime of genetically selected judges handing out instant justice to the bored, anarchic, mostly unemployed population of 400 million in a 2122AD New York, called Mega-City One. For him, democracy is 'a cancer eating at the heart of our society'. He says people 'need rules to live by - I provide them. They break the rules, I break them.' Wagner has at times tempered Dredd's rigid intolerance with a touch of self-doubt, even mercy. He is blessed too with self-parody. Brett Ewins, who was taught fine art at Goldsmiths College by Michael Craig-Martin, who also tutored Damien Hirst, says: 'Dredd made a mockery of science fiction. He was really quite satirical, even camp. We satirised big corporations, including fast food, and nearly ended up in court with McDonald's.' Which may help to explain why Dredd artwork prices have yet to take off in the US: most Americans' sense of humour does not extend to pastiche. But US collectors are becoming more sophisticated, and Dredd has all the makings of a new Superman for intelligent adults.

It is set during the Blitz and centres on Richard Roe, a diffident man who comes to London from a well-heeled country estate to volunteer for the Auxiliary Fire Service. Roe, the archetypal, tight-lipped English widower, who \"wished that he had never made a point of not kissing Christopher\", his five-year-old son, is contrasted with the professional fireman, Pye. Neither the war as whole, nor even the Blitz, impinges much on the narrative - both men are frighteningly at sea in personal emotional anguish - but fear hangs like a pall over this sombre novel. </p> <p> <strong> Gimme More</strong><br>Liza Cody <br>(Bloomsbury, \u00a36.99)<br> <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000436244,00.html\">Buy it at a discount at BOL</a><br> </p> <p> Birdie is a composite of every real and mythical rock girlfriend - a little bit of Marianne meets Angie and Courtney - yet now widowed and wrinkled, she still knows how to take on the industry suits and hang on to her cut.

Rock'n'roll doesn't usually transfer well to the page, but this thriller is carried by the ultra-cynical voice of Birdie and Cody's ability to create fictional lyrics, gigs and bands that won't make you wince. </p>",

Caught Henry Green (Harvill, \u00a36.99) Buy it at a discount at BOL One of a quartet of \"London\" novels republished by Harvill, Green's book is more curiosity than essential read. It is set during the Blitz and centres on Richard Roe, a diffident man who comes to London from a well-heeled country estate to volunteer for the Auxiliary Fire Service. Roe, the archetypal, tight-lipped English widower, who \"wished that he had never made a point of not kissing Christopher\", his five-year-old son, is contrasted with the professional fireman, Pye. Neither the war as whole, nor even the Blitz, impinges much on the narrative - both men are frighteningly at sea in personal emotional anguish - but fear hangs like a pall over this sombre novel. Gimme More Liza Cody (Bloomsbury, \u00a36.99) Buy it at a discount at BOL Birdie is a composite of every real and mythical rock girlfriend - a little bit of Marianne meets Angie and Courtney - yet now widowed and wrinkled, she still knows how to take on the industry suits and hang on to her cut. When Dog Records come sniffing after a film and demo that her lover, Jack, supposedly made before his death, she plays it \"like the cobra coiled round the treasure chest\". Rock'n'roll doesn't usually transfer well to the page, but this thriller is carried by the ultra-cynical voice of Birdie and Cody's ability to create fictional lyrics, gigs and bands that won't make you wince.",

Why, the child wondered as he slipped between his grandmother's flannel sheets, brought from Poland, did the old man have to sit out there? \"Why had our family (and everyone like us) been allocated black men and women (who were called 'boys' and 'girls' or just 'natives') as domestic servants?

Though undoubtedly nutty, its paranoid and exciting \u201ctop secret\u201d flavour has meant it continues to appeal to a motley crew of self-styled \u201cresearchers\u201d and evangelists on the fringes of society, including Ku Klux Klansmen, militias, certain fundamentalist Muslims and an ex-Coventry goalkeeper called David Icke. </p> <p>For Them: Adventures with Extremists , reporter and documentary film-maker Jon Ronson spent several years in the company of a few of these fringe-dwellers, in an attempt to understand their mindset and to see to what - if any - extent their fears were founded in fact. The resulting book is a funny and compulsively readable picaresque adventure through a paranoid shadow world, with Ronson playing Sancho Panza to a cast of obsessives. Ronson has a deft, ironic touch and a brilliant way with scene-setting and direct speech - much of the action is so neat and pacy it reads almost like a novel - and it is one of the book\u2019s great merits that it never takes itself too seriously. Conspiracy investigators tend to be incompetent and petty in direct proportion to the delusional grandeur of their ambitions, something Ronson is not slow to pick up on. \u201cI KNOW WHAT YOU\u2019RE UP TO!\u201d one investigator screams at his colleague. \u201cMake a big show of shouting down the phone! Steal the limelight! And then Jon will write about you !\u201d </p> <p>In one of the book\u2019s funniest chapters, Ronson accompanies an ultra-right-wing conspiracy investigator named Big Jim Tucker as he attempts to infiltrate a meeting of the Bilderberg Group (a semi-secret council of international industrialists and statesmen, and a favourite bugbear of the paranoid fringe). They end up being chased by scary-looking security personnel in dark glasses and Ronson panics, trying to get the British Embassy to rescue him. \u201cI am essentially a humorous journalist,\u201d he pleads down the phone. \u201cI am a humorous journalist out of my depth.\u201d </p> <p>But Ronson also has a point to make about the way beliefs in general tend to demonise \u201cthem\u201d, where \u201cthem\u201d might be diabolical Jews, 12ft lizards, or indeed the weirdos who believe in diabolical Jews and 12ft lizards. Exhibit A in the fringe-dwellers\u2019 case for the existence of a shadowy all-powerful cabal is the true-life story of the Weavers, a family with admittedly far-out religious views who, yes, consorted with neo-Nazis and who moved to the remotest corner of northern Idaho to be as far as possible from the \u201cZionist Occupational Government\u201d. Vicki Weaver and her son Sammy were shot in cold blood by federal marshals in a paramilitary-style raid. Conspiracy theorists have ever since argued that this is proof that the world is indeed run by a secret oligarchy; Ronson\u2019s compelling case is that what happened was made possible because the Weavers were repeatedly described in the media as \u201cwhite supremacists\u201d and therefore in some way worthy of extermination. </p> <p>Another chapter examines the strange history of David Icke, the footballer turned BBC commentator turned Green Party spokesman turned self-proclaimed son of God. Ronson finds Icke on a lecture tour of Canada, pursuing his new calling as an investigator of the secret elite of lizard shape-shifters (the Queen and Ted Heath are among those under suspicion) who run the world. Icke\u2019s \u201ctheory\u201d is basically The Protocols of the Elders of Zion with a new cast and a few script changes. Not surprisingly, Icke has come under suspicion of anti-semitism; as his tour progresses he finds his readings heavily picketed and his radio interviews cancelled. Icke vehemently repudiates the accusations, and reading Ronson\u2019s account it is difficult not to conclude that, while we are right to be on our guard against paranoid anti-semitism, we should also be on our guard against the paranoid excesses of anti-anti-semitism. Not only might it be unfair to Icke, but by implying that he is so dangerous that he has to be censored, the watchdogs are giving a patina of seriousness to ideas that are - let\u2019s face it - very, very silly. </p> <p>As the book progresses, what emerges is the degree to which the real-life Bilderberg Group and the researchers who campaign against it are negatives of each other. Intentionally or not, the alleged bodies of world domination do create suspicion and resentment with their cloak-and-dagger mentality, their self-importance and their alarmism. It is no surprise to learn that some Bilderbergers quite like the idea that they are secretly running the world: it flatters their vanity. Towards the end of his investigation, Ronson finds himself referred to approvingly on the internet and in underground newspapers by fringe researchers and New World Order believers. He suggests he has passed through the looking glass and is now \u201cone of them\u201d. I think this is going a little far. If pressed, and for all its flaws, I\u2019d say I\u2019m on the side of the existing international liberal-democratic system and against the notion that lizards might be running the world, and I suspect Ronson feels the same way. Still, it is to his great credit that he\u2019s given \u201cthem\u201d such a fair-minded - and entertaining - evaluation.</p>",

He described it as \"a poetry that is so utterly reliable and reassuring that you just can't gainsay it: it's like motherhood and apple pie\". Those who do complain about it, he continued, \"always end up sounding churlish, short-tempered, jealous or mad\". But there were some worried voices, sanely and politely stating their reservations about a writer who was monumental long before he was awarded the Nobel prize in 1995. </p> <p>Monumentalism must carry its own burdens, of course. Yet at the risk of sounding churlish or mad, it has to be said that his new collection, Electric Light, exhibits more of the weaknesses that have been discerned, and fewer of the strengths, than any of his recent collections. </p> <p>Heaney has always been a gift to the academic community, in that a \"career\" has been discernible from volume to volume. Critics love narratives of development as much as they love to pick out \"major themes\". Since Heaney's work has continually commented on itself, and also commented retrospectively on itself in the occasional revision or self-accusation (particularly in the sequence \"Station Island\"), this has made it easier to buttress the career narrative with quotes from the corpus. </p> <p> Death of a Naturalist (1966), the outstanding debut that made Heaney's name, was a volume that - like Tony Harrison's early work - played off articulacy and literariness against the unbookish taciturnity of family and \"tribe\". Later, with North (1975) , the Troubles were tackled (unavoidably, given the period), for instance in the poem \"<a href=\"http://www.newtrix.com/poems/sh-what.htm\">Whatever You Say, Say Nothing</a>\", which some found too untransformatively journalistic, but which I still find as powerful as when I first read it: </p> <p> The famous </p> <p>Northern reticence, the tight gag of place </p> <p>And times: yes, yes. Of the \"wee six\" I sing </p> <p>Where to be saved you only must save face </p> <p>And whatever you say, you say nothing. </p> <p>Heaney pleased many readers by producing an apparently politicised poetry; he dismayed partisans by not taking a clear position; and he was praised for not polemicising or sloganeering by those (particularly, one notes, the British) who felt that while treatment of the subject was unavoidable, it was not a poet's job to analyse the situation, propose solutions, and sort the whole thing out. </p> <p> North was a determining moment. He had been under vast pressure to take a stance on \"the Irish thing\", as he referred to it in the poem quoted above. He has written about that pressure ever since. In \"Flight Path\" (The Spirit Level), challenged by an IRA man (\"when, for fuck's sake, are you going to write/ Something for us?\"), he replies \"if I do write something, I'll be writing for myself\". That poem was published in 1996 but refers to the events of 1979 - \"the gaol walls all that month were smeared with shite\". Indeed they were, and two years later, Bobby Sands was the British MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone for all of a month, before he finally starved to death. </p> <p>It's fair enough that Heaney had no obligation to write about such matters, directly or obliquely. His care, when writing about an Ireland of which the hunger strikes and sectarian killings are as much a part as the bogs and the old farming communities, is understandable: he wanted to be a poet, not the \"Papish propagandist\" that an Ulster newspaper dubbed him anyway. But when the political is introduced - in that pentameter about the H-Block prisoners, for example - it is only in the context of what Heaney will or will not say. The drama we perceive is that of his dilemma as a writer, not Northern Ireland; we are encouraged to worry as much about the role of the artist in a political situation as we are about the political situation itself. </p> <p>His other approach to the subject, also much admired, was to find in the myths and bogs of Ireland metaphors and symbols of tribal violence. Critics who have accused him of ignoring the situa tion are easily refuted; those who find these symbols and metaphors ill-judged, too easily finding an artistic resolution of the acute and insoluble problem, are less easy to argue with. Here is poet Carol Rumens on Heaney's \"<a href=\"http://www.public.asu.edu/~agaah/eng200/heaney.html\">Mycenae Lookout</a>\", a description of the Trojan War and peace which we are clearly invited to take as an oblique reference to the peace process in 1990s Northern Ireland: \"As to whether it 'says something' about the political nightmare in Northern Ireland, the terms, as so often, seem too general. Perhaps readers and writers should be more wary of seeing such classical reworkings as 'fitting emblems' of any adversity but that of the original time and place.\" </p> <p>Now, there is no shortage of self-criticism (or apparent self-criticism) in Heaney's work. In \"Station Island\", the dead cousin he years earlier memorialised in \"The Strand at Lough Beg\" ripostes: \"You confused evasion and artistic tact . . . / I accuse you / . . . for the way you whitewashed ugliness and drew / the lovely blinds of the Purgatorio / and saccharined my death with morning dew\". It's true, too: in the earlier poem, there were references to Sweeney and Dante, two of Heaney's favourite resources, and a cleansing image. In \"Station Island\", Heaney seems to accept the accusation (he doesn't answer back, and the poem is full of statements of guilt, self-loathing, apology), but in fact is released by the shade of Joyce, who tells him \"don't be so earnest, // so ready for the sackcloth and the ashes. / Let go, let fly, forget.\" </p> <p>And fly he does - into the metaphysical, away from all that soil and rural memory, away from that satisfying thickness of alliteration and onomatopoeia he brought to frogspawn, blackberries and peat. In Seeing Things (1991) and The Spirit Level (the punning titles express an equilibrium between material and spiritual that has become something of a trademark), Heaney discovered a desire to \"credit marvels\". The first poem in Electric Light spells this out again. We return to Toomebridge and, economically, Heaney reminds us of all that the place means to him: the borderline </p> <p> Where the checkpoint used to be. </p> <p>Where the rebel boy was hanged in '98. </p> <p>Where negative ions in the open air </p> <p>Are poetry to me. As once before </p> <p>The slime and silver of the fattened eel. </p> <p>Heaney's commentators are going to be hard-pressed to see this volume as a development in a career. It restates all Heaney's themes and approaches to date, and in doing so manages to make many of them look like mannerisms. Despite the earlier wrestle over how to write about sectarian murder, now \"The Augean Stables\" refers to a more recent murder, that of Sean Brown, a friend of Heaney's who was gunned down during the peace process by loyalist wreckers. </p> <p>It only \"refers\" to the murder because the bulk of the poem is taken up with Greece, where Heaney heard the news - Olympia with its \"green willows, the lustral wash and run of river shallows\", and his \"favourite bas-relief\" of Athene showing Heracles where to divert the Alpheus to cleanse the Augean stables. The water images are actually associated with the murder only by Heaney's fortuitous presence in Olympia; they are then forcedly yoked with it by the image of Brown's blood being hosed off the tarmac outside a sports club. I may be alone in finding this employment of art and lyricism inappropriate and distasteful, and I may be alone in not finding the cleansing image of the myth any help at all when it comes to the political situation. This does not mean that I want Heaney to make a political statement, still less propose a solution; it is simply a question of how seriously Heaney took his self-accusation about \"The Strand at Lough Beg\". </p> <p>Heaney, in this new collection, refers often to his literary and artistic models, mentors or favourites: Virgil, Dante, Beowulf (understandably, since he translated it), Patrick Kavanagh, Brodsky, Hughes, Zbigniew Herbert. The last three are elegised, and Brodsky's elegy is written in the metre with which Auden elegised Yeats. Disconcertingly, its first few stanzas discuss the metre before getting round to the man. (It is hardly a criticism to say that it is a pale shadow of the Auden, though the metrical lapse nine lines from the end is unfortunate.) The presence of the pantheon has become more observable in Heaney's corpus as he has been more securely placed in it himself. That is, Heaney - as a poet, teacher and academic - has always been interested in traditions, but now seems comfortably cosseted in them. They become emblems of instant authority. </p> <p>As in \"The Augean Stables\", there is another troubling aspect to this, remarked upon before by critics: how Heaney, mythologising himself and his subjects, thrusts a borrowed significance onto them (\"I woke to the world there like Telemachos\"). Trying to make something freshly significant out of everyday material (which is one of the roles of poetry), he is sometimes overtly urgent and straining. In \"Lupins\", where he wants an image of steadfastness, he writes, punningly: \"They stood. And stood for something. Just by standing.\" That's telling us; and telling us rather than showing us. As the critic Barbara Hardy once wrote of Heaney, sometimes \"he calls to other images in order to have his say, not to make them strangely familiar or familiarly strange through meeting opposition and difference. This is domination, not discovery.\" The enlisting of ghosts to say his lines is another striking example of this, the worst case being \"The Journey Back\", from Seeing Things : \"Larkin's shade surprised me. He quoted Dante\" - to which one responds, yes, that certainly would be a surprise. The more common case, extended in this latest book, is of the simple pastoral description opened out, rather too quickly, into metaphysical assertion. In other cases, we are onlookers as Heaney describes his environment or an event, then tells us how it made him feel, or what it reminded him of. At times (as in the peculiar meanderings of \"The Loose Box\"), he seems to question or even mock this tendency, but he doesn't replace it with anything else. </p> <p> For a poet who wants to avoid being prescriptive - whether about politics or the spiritual - ambiguous, balanced symbols of nature and transcendence are overwhelmingly tempting. \"Perch\", with the rhythm, alliteration and assonance that have always been an enjoyable aspect of Heaney's craft (as they were with Hughes's), describes the fish as \"little flood-slubs, runty and ready . . . guzzling the current, against it, all muscle and slur\". But the metaphysical point is to contrast their stasis with the movement of the river. They are still points in a Heraclitean flux, \"in the everything flows and steady go of the world\". It is an attractive poem, an arresting image, beautifully phrased. And the volume as a whole plays with oppositions between drift and solidity, just as previous volumes set up oppositions between working with language and working the land, or between ground and flight, or between the material and the spiritual. </p> <p>It is done with the solid craftsmanship that one will always admire in Heaney, and that has deservedly made him a popular and major poet; and it displays a passionate enthusiasm, whether for people or land or language, that has always been engaging and admirable. But in this volume there is perhaps a too-easy reliance, born of facility, on now-traditional symbols, whether Heaney's own or from what Larkin called \"the myth-kitty\". They are used to present a spiritual earnestness rather than evoking it and to wrench from family anecdote a transcendence that doesn't seem wholly earned (indeed, as Peter McDonald noted of The Spirit Level , \"by now, Heaney's family history, in even its most trivial moments, is beginning to look overdetermined\"). </p> <p>Over and again, as in his lectures, Heaney vigorously affirms the role of the poet, while remaining vague as to what that role is: not to cure or heal but as \"some dutiful contemplative, pivoting his understanding in an attempt to bear his portion of the weight of the world, knowing himself incapable of heroic virtue or redemptive effect\". At times one is reminded of Roy Campbell's lines: \"You praise the firm restraint with which they write - / I'm with you there of course: / They use the snaffle and the curb all right, / But where's the bloody horse?\" It is as if in the absence of political engagement, and with the decision instead to seek out appropriate and representative symbols to which, as Heaney himself puts it, an audience might say \"yes, that's it\" in recognition, what is on offer is a quasi-pastoral, mostly secular Catholicism; a belief in and desire for transcendence. </p> <p>Heaney has criticised Larkin's pessimism, but the only difference between \"negative ions\" and \"the deep blue air/ that shows nothing, and is nowhere, and is endless\" is a spiritual optimism, a sense of celebration and hope. Heaney's poems say \"yes\", the \"enormous yes\" of Larkin's poem \"For Sidney Bechet\", which Heaney wishes had been more present in Larkin's work. But yes to what, exactly? In a postmodern age, confronted with pressing and global ethical and political questions, this is a premodernist, nostalgic poetry reaching back to romanticism: nature, God, the ineffable, the sublime. Reliable, reassuring: yes, yes. But something more, surely, is required.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Electric Light Seamus Heaney 81pp, Faber, \u00a314.99/\u00a38.99 Buy it at a discount at BOL In his Guardian review of Seamus Heaney's last collection, The Spirit Level (1996), Ian Sansom praised faintly, saying that it was \"worth reading out of habit and affection\". He described it as \"a poetry that is so utterly reliable and reassuring that you just can't gainsay it: it's like motherhood and apple pie\". Those who do complain about it, he continued, \"always end up sounding churlish, short-tempered, jealous or mad\". But there were some worried voices, sanely and politely stating their reservations about a writer who was monumental long before he was awarded the Nobel prize in 1995. Monumentalism must carry its own burdens, of course. Yet at the risk of sounding churlish or mad, it has to be said that his new collection, Electric Light, exhibits more of the weaknesses that have been discerned, and fewer of the strengths, than any of his recent collections. Heaney has always been a gift to the academic community, in that a \"career\" has been discernible from volume to volume. Critics love narratives of development as much as they love to pick out \"major themes\". Since Heaney's work has continually commented on itself, and also commented retrospectively on itself in the occasional revision or self-accusation (particularly in the sequence \"Station Island\"), this has made it easier to buttress the career narrative with quotes from the corpus. Death of a Naturalist (1966), the outstanding debut that made Heaney's name, was a volume that - like Tony Harrison's early work - played off articulacy and literariness against the unbookish taciturnity of family and \"tribe\". Later, with North (1975) , the Troubles were tackled (unavoidably, given the period), for instance in the poem \"Whatever You Say, Say Nothing\", which some found too untransformatively journalistic, but which I still find as powerful as when I first read it: The famous Northern reticence, the tight gag of place And times: yes, yes. Of the \"wee six\" I sing Where to be saved you only must save face And whatever you say, you say nothing. Heaney pleased many readers by producing an apparently politicised poetry; he dismayed partisans by not taking a clear position; and he was praised for not polemicising or sloganeering by those (particularly, one notes, the British) who felt that while treatment of the subject was unavoidable, it was not a poet's job to analyse the situation, propose solutions, and sort the whole thing out. North was a determining moment. He had been under vast pressure to take a stance on \"the Irish thing\", as he referred to it in the poem quoted above. He has written about that pressure ever since. In \"Flight Path\" (The Spirit Level), challenged by an IRA man (\"when, for fuck's sake, are you going to write/ Something for us?\"), he replies \"if I do write something, I'll be writing for myself\". That poem was published in 1996 but refers to the events of 1979 - \"the gaol walls all that month were smeared with shite\". Indeed they were, and two years later, Bobby Sands was the British MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone for all of a month, before he finally starved to death. It's fair enough that Heaney had no obligation to write about such matters, directly or obliquely. His care, when writing about an Ireland of which the hunger strikes and sectarian killings are as much a part as the bogs and the old farming communities, is understandable: he wanted to be a poet, not the \"Papish propagandist\" that an Ulster newspaper dubbed him anyway. But when the political is introduced - in that pentameter about the H-Block prisoners, for example - it is only in the context of what Heaney will or will not say. The drama we perceive is that of his dilemma as a writer, not Northern Ireland; we are encouraged to worry as much about the role of the artist in a political situation as we are about the political situation itself. His other approach to the subject, also much admired, was to find in the myths and bogs of Ireland metaphors and symbols of tribal violence. Critics who have accused him of ignoring the situa tion are easily refuted; those who find these symbols and metaphors ill-judged, too easily finding an artistic resolution of the acute and insoluble problem, are less easy to argue with. Here is poet Carol Rumens on Heaney's \"Mycenae Lookout\", a description of the Trojan War and peace which we are clearly invited to take as an oblique reference to the peace process in 1990s Northern Ireland: \"As to whether it 'says something' about the political nightmare in Northern Ireland, the terms, as so often, seem too general. Perhaps readers and writers should be more wary of seeing such classical reworkings as 'fitting emblems' of any adversity but that of the original time and place.\" Now, there is no shortage of self-criticism (or apparent self-criticism) in Heaney's work. In \"Station Island\", the dead cousin he years earlier memorialised in \"The Strand at Lough Beg\" ripostes: \"You confused evasion and artistic tact . . . / I accuse you / . . . for the way you whitewashed ugliness and drew / the lovely blinds of the Purgatorio / and saccharined my death with morning dew\". It's true, too: in the earlier poem, there were references to Sweeney and Dante, two of Heaney's favourite resources, and a cleansing image. In \"Station Island\", Heaney seems to accept the accusation (he doesn't answer back, and the poem is full of statements of guilt, self-loathing, apology), but in fact is released by the shade of Joyce, who tells him \"don't be so earnest, // so ready for the sackcloth and the ashes. / Let go, let fly, forget.\" And fly he does - into the metaphysical, away from all that soil and rural memory, away from that satisfying thickness of alliteration and onomatopoeia he brought to frogspawn, blackberries and peat. In Seeing Things (1991) and The Spirit Level (the punning titles express an equilibrium between material and spiritual that has become something of a trademark), Heaney discovered a desire to \"credit marvels\". The first poem in Electric Light spells this out again. We return to Toomebridge and, economically, Heaney reminds us of all that the place means to him: the borderline Where the checkpoint used to be. Where the rebel boy was hanged in '98. Where negative ions in the open air Are poetry to me. As once before The slime and silver of the fattened eel. Heaney's commentators are going to be hard-pressed to see this volume as a development in a career. It restates all Heaney's themes and approaches to date, and in doing so manages to make many of them look like mannerisms. Despite the earlier wrestle over how to write about sectarian murder, now \"The Augean Stables\" refers to a more recent murder, that of Sean Brown, a friend of Heaney's who was gunned down during the peace process by loyalist wreckers. It only \"refers\" to the murder because the bulk of the poem is taken up with Greece, where Heaney heard the news - Olympia with its \"green willows, the lustral wash and run of river shallows\", and his \"favourite bas-relief\" of Athene showing Heracles where to divert the Alpheus to cleanse the Augean stables.

This does not mean that I want Heaney to make a political statement, still less propose a solution; it is simply a question of how seriously Heaney took his self-accusation about \"The Strand at Lough Beg\". Heaney, in this new collection, refers often to his literary and artistic models, mentors or favourites: Virgil, Dante, Beowulf (understandably, since he translated it), Patrick Kavanagh, Brodsky, Hughes, Zbigniew Herbert. The last three are elegised, and Brodsky's elegy is written in the metre with which Auden elegised Yeats. Disconcertingly, its first few stanzas discuss the metre before getting round to the man. (It is hardly a criticism to say that it is a pale shadow of the Auden, though the metrical lapse nine lines from the end is unfortunate.)

But here the repressed and recovered memories are not those of soldiers shell-shocked in the trenches, but those of a peacetime murder by a child. In a resolutely unsensational yet disquieting novel with clear echoes of the Mary Bell and James Bulger cases, Barker probes not only the mystery of \"evil\" but society's horrified and incoherent response to it. </p> <p>The book opens in a derelict area of Newcastle's docklands, when Tom Seymour, a child psychologist, plunges into the Tyne to rescue a young man from drowning. The would-be suicide turns out to be Danny Miller, whom Seymour's expert witness had helped convict as a 10-year-old child for robbing and murdering an elderly woman in her home. Twelve years on, released with a new name and identity, Danny appeals to the psychologist to help him remember, and hence understand, his crime. </p> <p>The dangers of the process of recall after years of self-protective numbness - like putting someone with hypothermia \"next to a blazing log fire\" - builds suspense, as does the elusiveness of Danny's character and motivation. There are shades of Billy Prior from Barker's Booker-winning The Ghost Road in his \"trustless\", bisexual, manipulative charm. Intelligent and articulate (he is completing an English degree begun behind bars), Danny is smoothly plausible yet controlling. He blames Seymour for his sentence, and has a record of destroying the careers of \"over-involved\" care-workers, in one case through accusations of sexual harassment. \"He was very good at getting people to step across that invisible border,\" says one character of the way Danny lures people into breaking the rules. \"Lambs to the slaughter.\" </p> <p>Seymour, the humane yet fallible psychologist (who recalls Rivers from Regeneration), is writing a book on \"moral thinking in children with conduct disorder\". His growing self-doubt over his testimony on the 10-year-old Danny's moral maturity reflects today's disquiet over young children being tried in adult courts. Danny's recollections of beatings by his soldier father in a \"toughen-up-the-lad campaign\" do not absolve him; but as he tries systematically to rebut Seymour's testimony, they put into question his childhood grasp of morality. Seymour recalls an incident from his own childhood, when the bullying of a toddler beside a pond could have led to disaster but for the chance intervention of a passing adult. Tellingly, he feels no responsibility: \"In spite of the connecting thread of memory, the person who'd done that was not sufficiently like his present self.\" </p> <p>Less gritty in tone than much of Barker's work, the novel is imbued with a pervasive melancholy (despite a comic jab at writers' workshops). The hazards of reconstructing the past are echoed in Seymour's marriage, on the rocks partly through the couple's failed attempts to conceive (he describes his impotence as \"ovulation- prediction-kit droop\"). \"The snag in his present life ran back into the past and unravelled it. Because they were splitting up, it was easy to believe they'd never been happy.\" </p> <p>Barker depicts a range of attitudes towards rehabilitation, redemption and the notion of evil. The system is based on the rehabilitation of offenders, but this novel suggests both the inadequacy of those efforts and how hard people find it to believe in change. While Seymour's dreams reveal suppressed fear of his \"borderline psychotic\" charge and Danny at times appears as a kind of stalker, his anger and mistrust might be seen as rational reactions to a trial he could scarcely follow and incarceration in an adult prison (\"they should just come right out with it . . . I sentence you to be raped\"). When news reporters blow Danny's cover, both he and Seymour, in demand for TV soundbites, become \"hunted\". Images of snared rabbits and rapacious foxes recur, though Barker steers away from allowing Danny to style himself as a victim. He is haunted by the \"real\" victim, the elderly Lizzie (\"She's got a right to quite a few of my brain cells\"), and Barker makes sure that she forms the final image. </p> <p>\"How desperate people were,\" reflects Seymour, \"for an explanation - any explanation, as long as it was simple - and how difficult it was to supply one. No, not difficult, impossible.\" An insistence on the enigma at the heart of the crime, its unknowability, can seem like cheating, yet the withholding of answers creates its own haunting resonance. Is Danny \"cured\", or is he a walking time bomb? Like an Escher drawing, Danny's image changes before our eyes as he reflects the reader's fears and projections. As Barker turns the spotlight back onto our own attitudes, Border Crossing asks questions we can only answer for ourselves.</p>",

While Seymour's dreams reveal suppressed fear of his \"borderline psychotic\" charge and Danny at times appears as a kind of stalker, his anger and mistrust might be seen as rational reactions to a trial he could scarcely follow and incarceration in an adult prison (\"they should just come right out with it . . . I sentence you to be raped\"). When news reporters blow Danny's cover, both he and Seymour, in demand for TV soundbites, become \"hunted\". Images of snared rabbits and rapacious foxes recur, though Barker steers away from allowing Danny to style himself as a victim. He is haunted by the \"real\" victim, the elderly Lizzie (\"She's got a right to quite a few of my brain cells\"), and Barker makes sure that she forms the final image. \"How desperate people were,\" reflects Seymour, \"for an explanation - any explanation, as long as it was simple - and how difficult it was to supply one. No, not difficult, impossible.\" An insistence on the enigma at the heart of the crime, its unknowability, can seem like cheating, yet the withholding of answers creates its own haunting resonance. Is Danny \"cured\", or is he a walking time bomb? Like an Escher drawing, Danny's image changes before our eyes as he reflects the reader's fears and projections. As Barker turns the spotlight back onto our own attitudes, Border Crossing asks questions we can only answer for ourselves.",

Long ago in the war, she and her brother and sister were involved in a little innocent collaboration (more black market than death squads) that went horribly wrong. From trading scraps of information for Gauloises, they spiralled through witnessing German rumpy-pumpy in the village bar (with one dead body on the pavement) to fleeing the parish pursued by a mob who were convinced that the children's mother had informed on the apparent slaying of a German soldier by the R\u00e9sistance. </p> <p>Of course, nothing is quite what it seems.

At music summer camp, after an evening of adagios, you find yourself going the whole way with a willing, luscious, fiddle-playing blonde. Even better, she's eager to stay in touch. You're all set up: first girlfriend, sex on demand, a real life opening up before you. So what do you now spend all your time thinking about? Your mother. Uh-oh. </p> <p>Henry Shaw is a boy with a problem: he has a mother fixation as big as the Ritz. He lives in the Chicago suburbs with his history-teacher father, pianist mother and oddball sister. Elvira is a devoted Civil War re-enactor - the kind of hardcore fanatic who, at the tender age of 13, dresses full-time as a (male) soldier and spends weekends wading through muddy fields clutching a genuine 1853 Enfield musket. Their father, a book-bound Civil War obsessive himself, encourages this passion, while their mother frets that \"this tomboy phase is going to last the rest of her life\". </p> <p>Henry, on the other hand, is considered to be a \"wonderful boy, a model son\". As the only computer-literate member of a technologically oblivious household, he helps his mother set up her internet account. Accidentally typing in her password instead of his own one day, he's shocked to discover emails from a lover. Appalled but at the same time unable to resist feeding his torment, he embarks upon a year of eavesdropping. The snooping is understandable enough, but Henry's response - feverish, obsessive, all-consuming - isn't. Into this preoccupation with his mother's furtive sex life he pours all the emotional energy that could and should be going into his own nascent one. </p> <p>Her adultery - only only ever viewed through Henry's confused adolescent eyes - is not, of course, what the book is about. Neither does it matter that her lover is never a very concrete presence, because Hamilton is interested only in Henry's reaction to him. The trouble is, his response is just too weird and worrying. You know it, I know it, even he (it's hinted) is beginning to know it. But it's just not clear whether the author knows it. There is nothing wrong with splattering a novel with all this Oedipal ooze if the author is willing to get in there, rummage around and explore it. But Hamilton seems bafflingly bent on passing her tale off as a mere insightful little vignette of teenage sensitivity and familial betrayal. Maybe this book has at its heart something tangled and manic, but it's obscured by her strange reluctance to touch, taste and inspect it. </p> <p>All the same, there is plenty to admire. The eccentric beginnings of Elvira's re-enactment saga build to a kooky and gloriously well-realised climax, though it barely impacts on Henry. The parents' fraught relationship with their difficult daughter rings touchingly true, and is told with vicious humour and sadness. Hamilton can and does relay the shabby emotional chaos of family life with real comic panache. But that's the subplot, and its significance in the novel is clearly secondary. </p> <p>Meanwhile, what's wrong with young Henry - and why? Does the adult Henry who narrates the novel still have mother trouble? By not even beginning to answer these questions, Hamilton lets us down, leaving us with a novel almost as fey and disappointing as her The Short History of a Prince , which was (for me anyway) infuriatingly unprepared to throw down its ballet pumps and Actually Say Something. It's especially galling, given that Hamilton's A Map of the World is still one of the most exhilaratingly uncompromising novels I've read (if you haven't yet, it's Anne Tyler with aggro, Roth with humanity). I'd love to know what's happened, why she's running so scared - why, when she has proven herself capable of real, muscular genius, she now insists on giving us nothing but these weedy, soppy boys.</p>",

Nestling among the epigraphs from Wittgenstein and a work entitled Compulsion Neurosis , we come across a brief, illuminating sentence taken from Marion Milner's An Experiment in Leisure with which the psychoanalyst Adam Phillips chooses to send his new book into the world: \"My sole concern was to borrow forms, no matter from where, by which my own preoccupations could declare themselves.\" </p> <p>Leaving aside the biography of Winnicott and the collections of poetry and psychoanalytic papers that he has edited, this is the eighth time Phillips has felt compelled to explore his preoccupations and to share them with us; on this occasion, those concerns are so complex that they require him to borrow biography, cultural history, case study and literary criticism. And all, it appears, in order to open our eyes to the fantasies and fears that lead some of us to exist in an almost permanent state of flight, albeit uncertain of what we are escaping from and where we think we're going. It's a diagnosis that we may resist, but that Phillips patiently, and in tones of quiet urgency, insists is central to our self-knowledge. </p> <p>Phillips, like the man whose case study streaks through these pages, is dogged by his own virtue; and, like Houdini, he has something of the proselytiser about him. It's unthinkable that Phillips is not aware, as he eloquently unfolds the life of the master illusionist, of the parallels between them, so widely are the clues scattered. He describes Houdini variously as a lifelong adherent to a \"personal religion of performed ingenuity\", as a showman who \"held a mirror up to his audience, that was at once disruptive and reassuring\", or as a professional mystifier whose success depended on gaining people's confidence. As neat insights into the bizarre life of a man whose success demanded simply that he devise self-tortures ever more convoluted and seemingly inescapable, these descriptions have the ring of truth. But how far can they also be applied to the ingenious, esoteric interpretations of the psychoanalyst and the \"honest deceptions\" of the psychoanalytic writer? </p> <p>It is not hard to see why Phillips is drawn to Houdini: like the best kind of entertainer, he appeals in an extraordinarily wide range of ways. For Phillips, his life and his act - which are, at times, one and the same thing - offer a series of hugely suggestive parodies and inversions. Having arrived in America as a tiny child in the 1870s, Houdini witnessed his father, a former rabbi, fail to find the crock of gold; his response, \"a violent parody of assimilation\", was to work himself almost to death. Against his father's mystical Jewish tradition, Houdini assembled an unrivalled library of magic books, both restoring what his father had been forced to sell and adding his own counter-cultural interests. It was, Phillips suggests, both homage and rewriting, an ambiguous appropriation that nudged at but just about stayed within the bounds of orthodoxy. </p> <p>As did \"the work\". Houdini's assaults on the world of escapology provide enough material for several different, and equally convincing, readings. Phillips sees him as the paid transgressor of a society newly obsessed with artefacts of containment and confinement (handcuffs, straitjackets); as the performer who furnishes his audience with mimes of madness and criminality, the possible end of which is his own death; and as the \"Don Juan of his own devices\", whose \"revelation was always himself\" but who was locked into the cycle of repeatedly endangering and saving himself. Aside from the tricks themselves - from the initial box escape of \"Metamorphosis\" to the vividly named \"Chinese Water Torture Cell\" - there is Houdini's self-publicity, his unswerving deter mination to thumb his nose at the symbols and instruments of law and order while loudly proclaiming his adherence to its spirit. </p> <p>Phillips tickles out these peculiarities - both in Houdini and in his rapt audiences (who, surely, were tempted above anything by the prospect of a fatality) - with his customary urbanity and confident eye for the incongruent. When Houdini trumpets as his most realistic stunt a setup that involves him being strapped to a hospital bed, wound in sheets and doused in hot water (so the sheets would shrink), Phillips wonders what the real experience alluded to could possibly be. As for Chinese water torture, he muses, \"what exactly is the 'regulation manner' for locking people up in cabinets full of water?\" </p> <p>Phillips's rehearsals of Houdini's life are captivating, but they are, in some sense, a sideshow to the book's more serious concerns. As ever, Phillips is keen to discuss the wider implications of his researches and, in a chapter given over to claustrophobia and related neuroses, he extends his gaze backwards to \"the failed breakout\" of Adam and Eve and sideways to encompass the world of that \"characteristically modern escape artist\", the neurotic. Do we flee from what we fear because it is real, or does it become real because we flee it? In this topsy-turvy world where \"everything that you thought was important about yourself isn't, and everything you considered to be unimportant is crucial\" - where what we really need to do is escape escaping - Phillips insinuates himself as our authoritative guide, our friendly interpreter of fear and fantasy. </p> <p>Except that, occasionally, he fails. By far the most riveting magic trick in Houdini's Box is the reproduction, or at least approximation, of Phillips's sessions with a reluctant - or resistant - patient. In themselves, they are something of a mystery, for they include what we must assume to be near- verbatim accounts, complete with verbal tics, hesitations and blind alleys, of therapeutic exchanges. Are these transcripts of tape recordings? If so, is the participant aware that he is being recorded, and does he alter his behaviour accordingly? If not, does Phillips have an almost flawless memory for dialogue? Is the entire relationship partially or wholly fabricated? </p> <p>In these tense, frequently antagonistic sessions, Phillips offers himself both as the magician whose trick fails to enthrall its audience, and as the victim of a trick. His patient, a man who seeks out women in order to reject them, casts Phillips in a similar role. \"I wasn't sure if I was a fashion accessory, or a prosthesis,\" the analyst recalls. \"He had told me to keep quiet, and made me want to show off.\" </p> <p>As for the man, he asks some of the questions any self-respecting sceptic would pose. \"Do you think this does any good?\" he challenges. \"Don't you get bored of this?\" And, out of nowhere, \"Do you think wanking's radical?\" He brings his analyst a series of irreverent cartoons based on their encounters, tells Phillips he's patronising and finally sends him a Dear John letter. He had, he said, found the experience \"unexpectedly interesting\", but felt, on balance, that it might be better to stop. </p> <p>We are not entirely sure how Phillips reacts to this disappearing man, in private at least. In public, he turns him into a book; and books, both men agree, have contributed much to their professional and personal lives. It's an engaging and unsettling transformation - and one that, like Houdini's stunts and the vanishing acts of the other amateur escape artists featured here, we will have to ponder hard in order to fathom its implications.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Below us, the crystal sea surpasses all superlatives. We are on top of Table Mountain above the beautiful city of Cape Town. The vivid violet jacaranda, the blatant bougainvillea and frangipani are a dazzling canvas. We are cheating; escaping the rain and heading for the southern sun. How marvellous. The over fifties on their Saga saga begin to unwind, start to chat with one another. </p> <p>The long, hard trek lies ahead: 2,000 miles by coach, taking in this vast jigsaw of a country. It promises to be strenuous. </p> <p>\"Very nice,\" the retired GP remarks; a splendidly-attired Monsieur Hulot in his pristine safari suit. \"Very nice,\" his pretty wife replies. I soon learn that he is the leading light of his local Conservative Association. </p> <p>Des, our excellent tour guide, has a lived-in face. He immediately makes us feel at ease. He tells me he really enjoys guiding the over fifties. \"They've lived lives; they're far more interesting.\" </p> <p>We wander off. The streets in the Malay district open their arms, welcoming. I stroll alone with Erica, admiring the pastel-shade houses. John Betjeman would have had a ball along here. People beam when we say good morning. We go down to the waterfront. Back home, we were warned about strolling alone, but I've felt more threatenedoin the Kilburn High Road. </p> <p>On the way back to the hotel, I notice gangs of little boys near the traffic lights. High spirited, giggling street orphans jive-arsing about, in and out of their cardboard homes. They can be no more than six or seven years old. I drop them a few Rand and one turns triumphant cartwheels of delight. This image will constantly shadow us. But we remind each other that we are here to enjoy ourselves. </p> <p>The next day, we are leaving; all excited by the odyssey ahead. The Paarle estate, Knysa, Stellenbosch. Kirstenbosch is a Henri Rousseau botanical garden. And all the 901 species of birds, their little eyes-blinding beauty. Darting constantly. Ooohs and ahhhs resound. </p> <p>We pass through the Outeniqua canyon. The second largest in the world. John Ford would have had a field day here. And we reach Outshoorn. \"Sudden the desert changes,/The raw glare softens and clings,/Till the aching Outshoorn ranges/ Stand up like the throne of Kings,\" sang Rudyard Kipling. Here 120 years ago, Russian Jewish and Boer pioneers invented the ostrich-feather industry. In the morning, at an ostrich farm, I get uncomfortably close to a fearsome creature. I'm told its brain is smaller than its eyeball. One kick from his leg and it's curtains. At lunchtime, I get my revenge and eat my ostrich. He is delicious. </p> <p>Wilderness is another pretty town lost in time. In the beginning, an Englishman proposed to his lady love. \"I'll marry you if you take me to the wilderness,\" she responded. So he built a little house here, named it Wilderness, and thus this town was born. </p> <p>And so our long trek is under way, and there is this constant packing and unpacking. One or two days in any one place. And later all the places merge. Hotels coalesce into one. And the further we go, the more familiar and nicer everyone becomes. I'm worried. I'm starting to like the Daily Telegraph doctor. I'm even getting to like Brian who was once a Regimental Quarter Master Corporal in the Life Guards. </p> <p>Towns, people, places flash by. There's nothing like a long coach journey to cause masks to slip. </p> <p>South Africa is a country of stunning impressions. The monkeys carrying and clutching babies, pinching breakfasts from our plates. The peaceful pretty pastel towns. But just outside are the ubiquitous shanty towns. The indestructible impoverished people smile as we flash past. They wave. Erica and I wave back. Onward. </p> <p>We reach the Garden Route and I begin to lose chronology as the impressions come thick and fast. Port Elizabeth! Our disparate group is now splitting off, separating from the herd and eating together. The Daily Telegraphs! The Mails! The Mirrors! When they hear I am writing this for the Guardian, they hoot. The whole dynamic changes. </p> <p>Erica and I also find kindred spirits. There are four widows on this odyssey and two feisty Scottish ladies, Pauline and Joyce, who may as well be widows. They vilify their footloose husbands with such wonderful venom. And they gossip wickedly about the rest of us. </p> <p>Our little enclave also gossips. Gossip is as enjoyable as reading. It is the cement that binds us. We discuss each one of our compatriots, speculate upon their sex lives. If any. </p> <p>We fly to Durban. The Hilton hotel is bliss; it's wonderful to unwind, shower and unpack a few things. We warm to our widows. Mrs Pfeffer is an exceptional woman. She turns out to be an ex-Czech Catholic. She has a metal knee, is 75, hobbles but never complains. She swears by Saga. \"I feel safe. I was in extremis in Buenos Aires and they flew me home. They could not do enough.\" She is valiant, cultured and erudite. A few new friends make all the difference. </p> <p>Daphne, another widow, is urbane, beautiful, rich and amazingly generous. A near-death experience changed her life. Daphne travels all the time. Travelling seems to be the occupation of well-to-do widows. How Daphne always manages to look so well turned out beats me. Her clothes are never creased yet she has been living out of a suitcase just like the rest of us. </p> <p>We move on to KwaZulu where the high-kicking warriors put on a virile but quasi-tourist performance. Still, we've all got to earn a living. </p> <p>Later, we reach and pass through the majestic Drakenbourg range of mountains. Nobody is flagging yet, even though we sometimes cover more than 200 miles a day. </p> <p>The lodge at Malelane on the Crocodile River. The Kruger National Park. Zebras! A female giraffe turns her back on us and pees so elegantly. In the early-morning, a phalanx of 50 or more female elephants surround their babies and thunder towards a water hole. They are amazingly elegant and incredibly fast. And there they stand in a druidical circle, drinking their fill. There is a breathtaking silence. It is a mystical Blakean moment. </p> <p>The journey is almost over and we slowly wend our way into Pretoria. The Kruger memorial reminds me of Golders Green crematorium writ large. Des gets very emotional recounting the story of the Great Trek. Somehow you have to admire those Voortrekkers. </p> <p>Seven of us extend our holiday as the others leave for the airport. The goodbyes are awkwardly negotiated. Very English. But the two Scottish ladies kiss us warmly. We fly on to Victoria Falls. Words become clich\u00e9s when you stand before one of the most beautiful and awe-inspiring places on earth. </p> <p> T his is Zimbabwe and it is falling apart. But the Victoria Falls Hotel is an oasis of luxury and Edwardian splendour. We spend two days out of real life and conscience. </p> <p>On the Tarmac before us is a Douglas DC-4 Skymaster, built in 1945. The pilot tells us the piston went this morning but he think it's now repaired and airworthy. Our laughter is tinged with fear. It proves to be a journey of a lifetime, or more like a death time. I die 3,000 times before we reach Pietersburg, where we are resurrected to join The Pride of Africa, an Edwardian choochoo. It is pristine and elegantly glides right out of the past. We fall into our lavish suite, indulge in embarrassing luxury; we are to travel for two days and be pampered like royalty. But I protest when we are expected to dress for dinner: \"I'd rather die.\" </p> <p>\"Bernard! You're scruffy,\" says Brian. Later, he knocks on the door and hands me a clip-on. I wear it to please him. \"That's better. Now you look lovely.\" He pats my shoulder. </p> <p>\"But your trousers are still baggy,\" murmurs the ex-headmistress of a Tottenham primary school. </p> <p>At dinner there are roses, champagne and candlelight. And ostrich meat. </p> <p>\"The world in one country,\" the Saga brochure said. You can say that again and more. </p> <p>We are ever so slowly chugging back to Pretoria in our choochoo train. Now it is almost over for us. I feel depressed, but on our way to the airport we stop for a \"comfort break\". A beautiful sound lifts us. We are drawn to an open window of a schoolroom. Inside, fresh-scrubbed children sing Sugarbush. They giggle when they see us, then go straight into another song: You Are My Sunshine... </p> <p>This country must surely contend for being the most beautiful on earth. </p> <p>We wave goodbye to the others at Heathrow. Perhaps one or two friendships will endure, but we will lose contact with the rest. Ships that pass. Holidays are like that.</p> <p><strong>Way to go</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.saga.co.uk\">Saga Holidays</a> (call free on 0800 056 5880) offers 17 nights in South Africa (also available in 2002) from \u00a31,599 per person, including 15 breakfasts, 8 lunches and 14 dinners, insurance and cancellation cover, return scheduled flights, airport taxes, fees and charges.

Minifold glasses fold up to the size of a single lens and fit into a sturdy flip- top case, 40x80x15mm. Microvision Readers pack even smaller into a 12.5x15x 12mm aluminium case. Both are perfect for reading menus and fine print. Can you get them made up to a prescription? Of course. You can choose between five correction levels from +1 to +3.50. Are they comfortable? There are specially-designed silicon nose and temple tips. Any nice colours? Minifolds are pewter or white gold with a pewter or tortoiseshell case. Microvisions come in a choice of five colours, including a shiny copper pink with matching metallic case. Expensive? \u00a349.99 each plus \u00a33.99 p&amp;p from Presents for Men (01295 750100).",

The lazy, wine-soaked days when you flopped in the sun reading some fat novel before taking in a bit of culture and then ambling along to a local eaterie? </p> <p>Now think back to your last holiday. It could be difficult, because it probably isn't filed under \"holiday\" in your memory at all. Look under \"endurance test\", \"childcare marathon\", \"appalling car journeys\" or perhaps even \"major marital disputes\". If you can't find it anywhere, it could be because it was so awful that you've simply blanked it out. </p> <p>But various friends had been to Villa Pia. \"A real holiday,\" they said, despite struggling there with toddlers and pushchairs and grumpy older kids who'd rather have been en route to Disneyland. \"A proper rest,\" said one. \"So laid back,\" said another. \"We actually got a chance to talk,\" said a third. </p> <p>Villa Pia, a large beige-stoned 18th-century villa perched on an Umbrian hillside in the upper Tiber valley and surrounded in all directions by glorious views, is the home of Morag Cleland, her partner Kevin Begley and their three children. It is also, for seven months of the year, a holiday venue catering largely for stressed-out British parents and their offspring: a place to recharge the batteries, for the children to have a bit of freedom and to meet some new friends while you take in a bit of culture or simply chill out in the hammock in the villa's sunken courtyard. </p> <p>It would be wrong to call Villa Pia a hotel. Imagine some friends have moved to a big house in Italy and invited you to stay, and you'd be nearer the mark. Imagine when you arrived that they'd invited lots of other people you didn't know but found you had things in common with (well, kids at least) and you've got the concept in a nutshell. </p> <p>We finally turned down the villa's drive in the darkness of the evening, having endured a nightmarish journey from Bologna airport punctuated with fights on the back seat and cries of \"are we nearly there?\" which started before we'd got the keys into the ignition. Opening the door into the farmhouse kitchen was like stumbling on a party: \"What are you having to drink?\" asked Kevin as soon as we were over the threshold, and the children were spirited off for much-needed chicken and roast potatoes. </p> <p>Villa Pia was born four years ago after Kevin and Morag, who used to live in Surrey, realised there was a gap in the market for hard-pressed parents wanting a holiday that was more informal than a hotel, but more restful than self-catering. It was a gap they seem extraordinarily well-qualified to plug: in a previous life Kevin was a chef at the Dorchester, while Morag was a therapist. No surprise, then, that you get good food and sympathetic conversation in abundance. </p> <p>Mealtimes are the social highpoints of the day, starting with a help-yourself breakfast around the kitchen table, through to a buffet lunch, kids' tea at 6pm and adult supper at 8.30pm. Everyone eats together at a long table, so inevitably you can find yourself sitting next to someone you might not want to spend two hours with, but the mix is big enough for the communal living not to get boring (Villa Pia can cater for up to 40 houseguests including children). </p> <p>The atmosphere is easy-going - it's the sort of place where you can leave your muddy shoes in the hall after a tramp through the hillside, and if you fancy some music you just put something you like on the CD player in the clutter-strewn hall. The bedrooms are large and most have extra beds in case you want to keep a close eye on the kids: all have bathrooms. In the kitchen, a huge fridge is packed with wine from the local vineyard, beer, fruit juice and milk - you're free to help yourself and your kids to whatever you want, whenever you want it. </p> <p>Morag, whose youngest child is just five months old, is almost always on hand to dispense advice about where to go and what to see. In fact it's more a question of what to miss out: Villa Pia is surrounded by cultural gems. Florence is 30 minutes away by train: Perugia, more interesting to the kids in its role as Italy's \"chocolate city\" than for its medieval art, is about an hour's drive, and Assisi, birthplace of St Francis, a little further away. </p> <p>When we finally managed to tear our children away from the swimming pool, the woods (\"brilliant for making dens in\", according to the kids) and the courtyard playroom, we plumped for Siena in neighbouring Tuscany. Sightseeing and young children don't exactly go hand in hand, but do your homework first and you can manage to see the essentials and still come away with your sanity intact. </p> <p>Siena is ideal in that there's only one place you've got to see and that's the Piazza del Campo: buy your kids a hunk of pizza and you can sit and admire the architecture while they chomp away in the sunshine. Round the corner is the black-and-white striped marble Duomo (\"just like a zebra,\" said my six-year-old), and they all behaved passably well for a quick 10-minute tour - not what you'd have done BC, of course, stuffed as it is with Renaissance art, but as good as you'll get in the circumstances. Particularly good for little ones is the fact that the most accessible part of the cathedral, its floor, is littered with marble panels depicting all kinds of fascinating subjects from prophetesses to she-wolves. </p> <p>Our other big day out was to Gubbio with its perilous cable-car journey up the mountain to the Basilica of Saint Ubaldo. It's a six-minute ride, with fabulous views behind you to the city if you dare open your eyes - great for toddlers who can stand and peer through the railings as you rise up over the terracotta rooftops. In the church there's a further treat for the children - the chance to view the remains of old Ubaldo himself as he lies in state in a glass casket above a marble altar. \"Did he always look that ill?\" asked the six-year-old. Let's hope not. </p> <p>Five minutes beyond Lippiano is Monterchi, a hill town famed for its fresco by Piero della Francesca. The Madonna del Parto, shows Mary about to give birth and is the only major Renaissance depiction of the pregnant Virgin - amid the busloads of tourists are occasional pilgrimages of Italian mothers-to-be who come to pray at the sacred picture. </p> <p>What's great about an art gallery that houses just one work, as Monterchi's does, is that it is entirely manageable even for a couple with daughters in tow aged eight, six and two. Indeed, this was my six-year-old's first go at artistic interpretation: \"She doesn't look that happy to be having a baby, does she?\" said Elinor, while her big sister Rosie chimed in with, \"Well, Elinor, she didn't exactly want to have Jesus, did she? The Angel Gabriel talked her into it.\" </p> <p>And when you tire of sightseeing, you know there'll be a glass of wine waiting for you at Villa Pia.</p> <p><strong>Way to go</strong></p> <p>Villa Pia, 06010 Lippiano, Italy. Tel 0039 075 850 2027 for more information. Villa Pia is open from the end of March to October and costs \u00a3440 per adult and \u00a3180 per under-12 per week, full board (under twos are free).

Round the corner is the black-and-white striped marble Duomo (\"just like a zebra,\" said my six-year-old), and they all behaved passably well for a quick 10-minute tour - not what you'd have done BC, of course, stuffed as it is with Renaissance art, but as good as you'll get in the circumstances. Particularly good for little ones is the fact that the most accessible part of the cathedral, its floor, is littered with marble panels depicting all kinds of fascinating subjects from prophetesses to she-wolves. Our other big day out was to Gubbio with its perilous cable-car journey up the mountain to the Basilica of Saint Ubaldo. It's a six-minute ride, with fabulous views behind you to the city if you dare open your eyes - great for toddlers who can stand and peer through the railings as you rise up over the terracotta rooftops. In the church there's a further treat for the children - the chance to view the remains of old Ubaldo himself as he lies in state in a glass casket above a marble altar. \"Did he always look that ill?\" asked the six-year-old. Let's hope not. Five minutes beyond Lippiano is Monterchi, a hill town famed for its fresco by Piero della Francesca. The Madonna del Parto, shows Mary about to give birth and is the only major Renaissance depiction of the pregnant Virgin - amid the busloads of tourists are occasional pilgrimages of Italian mothers-to-be who come to pray at the sacred picture. What's great about an art gallery that houses just one work, as Monterchi's does, is that it is entirely manageable even for a couple with daughters in tow aged eight, six and two. Indeed, this was my six-year-old's first go at artistic interpretation: \"She doesn't look that happy to be having a baby, does she?\" said Elinor, while her big sister Rosie chimed in with, \"Well, Elinor, she didn't exactly want to have Jesus, did she? The Angel Gabriel talked her into it.\" And when you tire of sightseeing, you know there'll be a glass of wine waiting for you at Villa Pia. Way to go Villa Pia, 06010 Lippiano, Italy. Tel 0039 075 850 2027 for more information. Villa Pia is open from the end of March to October and costs \u00a3440 per adult and \u00a3180 per under-12 per week, full board (under twos are free). We flew to Bologna with Go (0845 6054321,) for \u00a378 each return, and hired a car through Autos Abroad (08700 667788) for \u00a3229 for seven days.",

      "body": "<p>Can't stand the heat and dust? Staying underground is cool. Not that cool, however, which is why troglodyte communities, miners and monks were originally attracted to cave dwellings, enjoying miraculous natural insulation against extreme temperatures. Nowadays, converted caves, canyon hotels and even underwater rooms can add an exotic dimension to the holiday experience. Claustrophobes need not apply. </p> <p><strong> Coober Pedy, South Australia</strong><br> </p> <p> Go down under, Down Under. Coober Pedy is a small but famous mining town along the beaten Alice Springs to Adelaide track. Famous not only for its opal production (\"the Opal Capital of the World\") but also for its underground lifestyle. Miners soon discovered the advantages of living underground to escape the heat of the summer (temperatures regularly hit 35C in the shade) and winter's cold desert nights. The underground \"dugouts\" provided comfortable even temperatures, and almost half the city's population still lives underground, their homes excavated into hillsides rather than dug from shafts. On any city tour you'll be treated to a below-ground cinema, home, church, museum and opal mine. </p> <p>After this it makes sense to stay underground. Desert Cave is probably the most popular option, the world's only underground four-star hotel with restaurant, bar, pool, sauna, spa and gym cut out of the sandstone. You can sleep either underground or, in case of panic, one of a few above-ground suites. </p> <p>\u0095 Tailor Made Travel (01386 712050) can arrange most holiday combinations to Australia. A two-day trip to Coober Pedy from Adelaide costs \u00a3352 including return flights, one night at the Desert Cave, airport transfer and a four-hour tour of the mining town. For a free copy of the Australia Travellers Guide, phone 0906 8633235 or visit <a href=\"http://www.australia.com\">www.australia.com</a> </p> <p><strong> Matmata, Tunisia</strong><br> </p> <p> Holidaymakers to Tunisia tend to fall into two camps. Those who come to flop on the Mediterranean at one of the sun-drenched resort hotels along the north-east coast. And those with a sense of adventure who prefer to experience the Sahara, the culture and the still desert nights. For the latter, the underground houses of Matmata are a must. </p> <p>The Berbers who first inhabited this central southern region were troglodytes who, in the 4th century, created an almost invisible village. Although buildings have now extended above it, many of the 50 underground houses are still in use and three of the largest have been converted into hotels. Star Wars fans will recognise Luke Skywalker's sunken desert home, and perhaps the Hotel Sidi Driss, used for the alien jazz club sequence. </p> <p>\u0095 Explore Worldwide (01252 760100) features one night in a cave hotel as part of its Ancient Carthage and Camel Safari trip. The 15-day tour costs from \u00a3565pp, including flights, transport, most meals, an Explore leader, driver, camel tenders and a cook during the three-day camel trek. </p> <p><strong> Cappadocia, Turkey</strong><br> </p> <p> It took a few million years of volcanic activity from the three tall (but now peaceful) peaks in the region, and then a few more million years of weather erosion to bring us to today's dreamy scenery known as Cappadocia. Ancient Cappadocia was a huge province, but today's tourist visits are based on the rock cities, and the valley of Goreme, which lie between Nevsehir and Urgup 11 miles to the east. Tufa, blown into futuristic formations, fills the valley, between the lush gardens, citrus orchards, olive groves and vineyards. </p> <p>If you're short on time, at least visit the Goreme open-air museum where more than two dozen churches make up the largest monastic complex in the region, all hewn out of the cliffs and crags, joined by stairs, paths and tunnels. Then there are the underground cities (six discovered so far, three excavated and lit for visitors). Each one accommodated several thousand inhabitants, with underground springs and elaborate ventilation systems. Derinkuyu is the best known, dropping at least 15 floors. The cities are interconnected by a network of tunnels, some as long as six miles. </p> <p>\u0095 Tapestry Holidays (020-8235 7777), which tailors holidays throughout Turkey and Greece, has found the best place to stay, the beautiful and highly unusual Cave House Terrace. It consists of three properties: two hotels (seven rooms each) with a similar, third planned for this summer; and a self-catering house. Most people choose three to five days in Cappadocia followed by either Istanbul or a week on the coast. Sample price: four days in Cappadocia, one week on the coast costs \u00a31,050 including flights, transfers and accommodation throughout. Prices include a personal guide at Cappadocia - strongly advised but not essential. </p> <p><strong> Loire Valley, France</strong><br> </p> <p> Book a room in a rock. Les Hautes Roches Hotel in the Loire Valley offers just that, although it's a far cry from Fred Flintstone. This grand Relais Chateaux hotel is a converted monastery, standing against an imposing backdrop of soft tuffeau rock on the banks of the Loire River at Rochecorbon. </p> <p>Many of the caves in this region, once excavated for their stone, are now recycled as wine cellars, mushroom farms and restaurants - Les Hautes Roches is most famous throughout France for its 15 troglodyte bedrooms and its gorgeous terraces overlooking the water. Caves also, by definition, provide fine cellarage - expect fine vintages on the menu. The Vouvray area is littered with d\u00e9gustation-vente signs, and tastings are easier to come by here than anywhere else in the Loire Valley. </p> <p>\u0095 Travelscene (020-8424 9648) features Les Hautes Roches as part of its self-drive short breaks programme. Two nights from \u00a3185pp including ferry. To book direct, call Relais Chateaux (00800 20000002) or the hotel: 86 quai de la Loire, 37210 Rochecorbon, Vouvray (00 33 2 47 52 88 88). Double rooms from Ffr650. </p> <p><strong> Grand Canyon, Arizona</strong><br> </p> <p> There's underground. There's deep underground. And there's mind-bogglingly deep underground. Phantom Ranch, the only accommodation option actually inside the Grand Canyon, stands at the bottom of the inner gorge. Its cabins, corrals and outbuildings clustered around a central lodge stand just to the east of the point where Bright Angel Creek meets the Colorado River, a beautiful spot landscaped with huge cottonwood trees and fruit orchards. Guests stay in either cabins (reserved for the use of riders on Fred Harvey mule trips), or in 10-bunk dormitories, basic but comfortable. These cost $22 a night with bedding. Visitors inevitably arrive weary, having travelled down the canyon either on a mule, on foot or by rafting the Colorado, so hearty meals are available with dishes such as Hiker's Stew, and 12oz New York steaks served in the canteen. </p> <p>\u0095 The waiting list is long, so you need to book at least 10-12 months in advance. Call 001 520 638 2631 direct or ask Ranch America (01923 671831) to help - it can package all manner of holidays in Arizona and elsewhere in America. </p> <p><strong> Cave Country, Andalucia</strong><br> </p> <p> More than 300 people live in caves around the Hoya de Guadix plain area of Andalucia, making it the largest community of cave dwellers in Europe. It lies north-east of Granada, a dry, barren limestone area, semi-desert in places, quite unlike the snow-clad mountains of the Sierra Nevada that tower in the distance. There's no shortage of cave accommoda tion for visitors. Cuevas de Galera, overlooking the village of Galera, has 20 fascinating caves to choose from, each recently renovated to sleep from two to eight, and each named after a famous Moorish visitor to the area. These caves used to be dwellings, stables or grain stores and have been sensitively transformed using traditional furniture, bright Arab colours and fabrics. Cuevas Laveranda has more of a hotel feel to it, its 11 rooms carved out of the dry rocks of the Baza-Huescar valley with views over the pine forests and craggy peaks. </p> <p>Those who prefer to self-cater may be happier in Cuevas Pedro Antonio de Alarcon, half a mile from the historic town of Guadix, where 19 cave apartments come kitted out with kitchenette, bathroom, TV and telephone. </p> <p>\u0095 Mundi Color (020-7828 6021) offers some 50 cave rooms and apartments in Cave Country. Prices start at \u00a317pp per night B&amp;B. </p> <p><strong> Chez Vous, France</strong><br> </p> <p> If you fancy self-catering as a troglodyte, Brittany Ferries (0870 5360360) can help. As part of its French holiday cottage programme, it offers three houses cut into the rocks along the river Loire. One is an authentic single-storey troglodyte house at the untouristy town of Langeais, built into the caves with all mod cons, minutes from an impressive chateau. The house is reached by climbing 20m down steps from the main road. The central heating, dishwasher, microwave, barbecue and cool cave garage have presumably been added since the days of the original inhabitants (one week from \u00a3228). </p> <p>Further along the river at Asni\u00e8res near the flower-filled town of Vend\u00f4me is a two-bedroomed cave-dwelling g\u00eete, which has been skilfully built into the rocks by the stonemason owner (one week from \u00a3180). The third is a chambre d'h\u00f4te hotel close to the fascinating old town of Doue la Fontaine. Carved out of a rocky outcrop, the hotel has a heated outdoor pool, garden, terrace and bicycle hire. From \u00a337pp a night half-board. </p> <p>G\u00eete prices are per property, excluding ferry. Contact Brittany Ferries for both sea crossing and accommodation arrangements. </p> <p><strong> Key Largo, Florida</strong><br> </p> <p> Florida may start off with Disney's razzamatazz, but the further south you travel, the mellower it becomes until, by the time you've left Miami and crossed the bridge into Bogart and Bacall's Key Largo, life is so laid-back you're nearly horizontal. The first and longest island of the Florida Keys, Key Largo is also famous for the John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park whose 78 square miles reef is North America's only living coral reef and is home to over 600 species of tropical fish. Visitors can snorkel, rent boats and tour in a glass-bottomed vessel. But those with diving certificates have an opportunity for closer encounters, at Jules' Undersea Lodge (001 305 451 2353). This tiny hotel is anchored 30ft below the water and can only be accessed by diving through tropical mangrove. Imagine staying in a submarine and you get the picture, except that these rooms are well equipped with private baths, round windows, and are linked to land by an intercom system. Can't dive? The hotel offers three-hour crash courses (\u00a355), compulsory for beginners before they unpack. One night with gourmet dinner costs \u00a3250.</p> <p><strong>...and a couple you can sleep near</strong></p> <p> <strong>Havasu Canyon, Arizona</strong></p> <p>Havasu Canyon lies 35 miles north of Grand Canyon village. The land belongs to the Havasupai Indians who long ago decided against any road-building in the area, so most residents and tourists arrive by mule, horse or on foot. The star attractions are the canyon's four stunning waterfalls - Navajo Falls, Havasu Falls, Beaver Falls and Mooney Falls, the largest at 196ft. You can camp in the canyon on the delightful Havasu Campground, reserving a place in advance through Havasupai Tourist Enterprises (001 520 448 2121). The campsite is set in an especially narrow and high-walled section of the canyon, stretching for almost a mile as far as Mooney Falls, with tents pitched in clearings in the woods either side of the stream.</p> <p>It's certainly primitive but drinking water is safely provided by fresh springs in the canyon wall. And when it's time to return to reality, one of the cluster of horses tethered at the entrance will carry you back up the hill.</p> <p>\u0095 American Adventures &amp; Roadrunner (01892 512700) tailors packages to include camping both within and just outside US national and state parks and operates small group trips through the Havasu Canyon area following set itineraries. It does not, however, feature Havasu Campground which has to be booked direct.</p> <p><strong>Temples of Ellora, India </strong></p> <p>The World Heritage-listed cave temples at Aurangabad in western India (above) are one of the world's umissable sights. Over five centuries, generations of Buddhist, Hindu and Jain monks carved monasteries, chapels and temples from a 2km escarpment and decorated them with elaborate sculptures. The caves are almost Egyptian in style, very like Abu Simbel inside and heavily painted with hieroglyphs. There are 34 in all, 12 Buddhist, 17 Hindu and five Jain. The best of all is the Kailasa Temple, the world's largest monolithic sculpture, dedicated to Shiva and hewn from the rock by 7,000 labourers over a 150-year period. Official guides can be hired outside Kailasa Temple.</p> <p>\u0095 As part of a 24-night trip in India and Nepal, from Mumbai to Kathmandhu, <a href=\"http://www.dragoman.com\">Dragoman</a> (01728 861133) includes camping around Ellora, although you cannot sleep inside the caves. The trip costs \u00a3700 plus a kitty of $250 including everything but flights, travelling in 24-person overland tour vehicles carrying two leaders and all camping gear.</p>",

The caves are almost Egyptian in style, very like Abu Simbel inside and heavily painted with hieroglyphs. There are 34 in all, 12 Buddhist, 17 Hindu and five Jain. The best of all is the Kailasa Temple, the world's largest monolithic sculpture, dedicated to Shiva and hewn from the rock by 7,000 labourers over a 150-year period. Official guides can be hired outside Kailasa Temple. \u0095 As part of a 24-night trip in India and Nepal, from Mumbai to Kathmandhu, Dragoman (01728 861133) includes camping around Ellora, although you cannot sleep inside the caves. The trip costs \u00a3700 plus a kitty of $250 including everything but flights, travelling in 24-person overland tour vehicles carrying two leaders and all camping gear.",

Mont\u00e9 au beurre (enriched with butter): doesn't that phrase send a shiver of pleasure down to your very withers? </p> <p>Tron?on de turbot r\u00f4tie aux c\u00e8pes, sauce \u00e0 la lie de vin rouge; noisettes de chevreuil, sauce Grand Veneur au chocolat amer et garniture chasse; moelleux \"pur Cara?be\" Valhrona ti\u00e8de, cr\u00e8me d'amandes am\u00e8res et place au caf\u00e9 grill\u00e9. This is French cooking of a very specific kind, rooted firmly in a region, buffed and burnished to a handsome sheen by the disciplines and standards of the haute cuisine kitchen.</p> <p>The chef - who is also the co-proprietor along with his wife, Zara - is Samuel Gicqueau, who comes from the Vend\u00e9e, a place of wind and water. It may be this, or the proximity of the sea on his own doorstep, that accounts for the large proportion of fish dishes on the menu. From among them, Hermione selected the carpaccio de coquilles St Jacques au caviar oscietra, tagliatelle de concombre \u00e0 la cr\u00e8me fra?che accidul\u00e9 et ciboulette. I could scarcely contain my excitement at the sight of fricass\u00e9 d'anguilles, pommes ratte du Touquet \u00e9cras\u00e9e \u00e0 l'ail et artichaut. Eel, eel, I could sing a hymn to the eel as a fish to eat. Most people squirm at the very thought. I smack my lips in anticipation.</p> <p>But eel has to be handled carefully. It is a fish of liver-thrashing richness. Unless the fat is cooked out of it, it can taste like greasy blotting paper. This eel had been rendered to a state of crisp perfection. The outside had a light, friable rime that gave way to a succulent, firm flesh of distinctive flavour. </p> <p>The garlic, artichoke and potatoes provided earthy doo-wah-wah backing to the piscine richness, with a well-moulded chicken stock lubricating the elements.</p> <p>Hermione's carpaccio of scallops was more refined and, if anything, even richer. It is easy to forget just how filling fish actually is. The surface of a large plate was covered in wavelets of thin, opalescent slices of scallop, which had that penetrating sweetness you get only with very, very fresh shellfish. There had been no stinting with the caviar studding this lagoon of scallops, which was sprinkled with sea salt that crunched agreeably between the teeth. In fact, the dish would have been too salty had it not been for the bland but crunchy tagliatelle of cucumber.</p> <p>From there, she progressed on to the noisettes of venison with the classically appropriate red wine-based sauce Grande Veneur that had been given new life and oomph by the addition of chocolate. This was grand cooking. The venison was mellow flavoured, cooked enough not to offend the sensibility that baulks at blood, not over-cooked to make life difficult for the dentally challenged.</p> <p>If that dish was like the brass section of an orchestra, my canon d'agneau de Romney Marsh r\u00f4ti, jus simple au romarin et tian de l\u00e9gumes aux saveurs de Provence provided the strings. In the midst of foot-and-mouth mayhem, it was cheering to be reminded just how good British meat is when sourced with care, butchered with skill and cooked with real respect for its qualities. All M. Gicqueau had done was to provide the lamb with the accompaniments to show off its herbal sweetness, depth of flavour and natural tenderness. The gravy was a superb example of self-effacing support, its own balance helping to bring out the shining quality of the meat, and the vegetables robust enough to bring a change of direction without upsetting the equilibrium of the whole.</p> <p>If ever a dinner called for a pudding, this was it: for me, the chocolate and almond cream thingy proved irresistible, while Hermione cleared her palate with pomme souffl\u00e9 au calvados, beurre de cidre au pommeau et son croustillant glac\u00e9. Both of these dishes were on a par with what had gone before, and very quickly went the same way.</p> <p>It's not often these days that I come across a menu on which I want to eat every dish, but I would have happily permed any of the seven first courses, seven main courses and five puddings, and still come out purring. </p> <p>As befits such a place, the wine list is also almost exclusively French - well, the most serious part of it is, anyway - but when those wines are of such consistent excellence, why on earth would you complain? They go exceptionally well with the dishes. Certainly our bottle of Alain Graillot's Crozes-Hermitage stood up with great elegance and force to the battering our dishes gave it, and was worth every one of its 29 pounds. On top of that, we had a glass of this and that, water and such, so that the liquid element of the bill came to \u00a346. The food came to \u00a392, and so the total was \u00a3138.</p> <p>Now, \u00a3138 is more than a day's wages where I come from, but finding French cooking in England of such quality is rarer than an Andy Cole goal in an England shirt.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Open Lunch, Wed-Sun, 12.15-1.30pm; dinner, Tues-Sat, 7.15-9.30pm Menus Midweek lunch/dinner, \u00a322 for three courses; Friday dinner-Sunday lunch, \u00a331 for five courses.

Eel, eel, I could sing a hymn to the eel as a fish to eat. Most people squirm at the very thought. I smack my lips in anticipation. But eel has to be handled carefully. It is a fish of liver-thrashing richness. Unless the fat is cooked out of it, it can taste like greasy blotting paper. This eel had been rendered to a state of crisp perfection. The outside had a light, friable rime that gave way to a succulent, firm flesh of distinctive flavour. The garlic, artichoke and potatoes provided earthy doo-wah-wah backing to the piscine richness, with a well-moulded chicken stock lubricating the elements. Hermione's carpaccio of scallops was more refined and, if anything, even richer. It is easy to forget just how filling fish actually is. The surface of a large plate was covered in wavelets of thin, opalescent slices of scallop, which had that penetrating sweetness you get only with very, very fresh shellfish. There had been no stinting with the caviar studding this lagoon of scallops, which was sprinkled with sea salt that crunched agreeably between the teeth. In fact, the dish would have been too salty had it not been for the bland but crunchy tagliatelle of cucumber. From there, she progressed on to the noisettes of venison with the classically appropriate red wine-based sauce Grande Veneur that had been given new life and oomph by the addition of chocolate. This was grand cooking. The venison was mellow flavoured, cooked enough not to offend the sensibility that baulks at blood, not over-cooked to make life difficult for the dentally challenged. If that dish was like the brass section of an orchestra, my canon d'agneau de Romney Marsh r\u00f4ti, jus simple au romarin et tian de l\u00e9gumes aux saveurs de Provence provided the strings. In the midst of foot-and-mouth mayhem, it was cheering to be reminded just how good British meat is when sourced with care, butchered with skill and cooked with real respect for its qualities. All M. Gicqueau had done was to provide the lamb with the accompaniments to show off its herbal sweetness, depth of flavour and natural tenderness. The gravy was a superb example of self-effacing support, its own balance helping to bring out the shining quality of the meat, and the vegetables robust enough to bring a change of direction without upsetting the equilibrium of the whole. If ever a dinner called for a pudding, this was it: for me, the chocolate and almond cream thingy proved irresistible, while Hermione cleared her palate with pomme souffl\u00e9 au calvados, beurre de cidre au pommeau et son croustillant glac\u00e9. Both of these dishes were on a par with what had gone before, and very quickly went the same way. It's not often these days that I come across a menu on which I want to eat every dish, but I would have happily permed any of the seven first courses, seven main courses and five puddings, and still come out purring. As befits such a place, the wine list is also almost exclusively French - well, the most serious part of it is, anyway - but when those wines are of such consistent excellence, why on earth would you complain? They go exceptionally well with the dishes. Certainly our bottle of Alain Graillot's Crozes-Hermitage stood up with great elegance and force to the battering our dishes gave it, and was worth every one of its 29 pounds. On top of that, we had a glass of this and that, water and such, so that the liquid element of the bill came to \u00a346. The food came to \u00a392, and so the total was \u00a3138. Now, \u00a3138 is more than a day's wages where I come from, but finding French cooking in England of such quality is rarer than an Andy Cole goal in an England shirt. \u00b7 Open Lunch, Wed-Sun, 12.15-1.30pm; dinner, Tues-Sat, 7.15-9.30pm Menus Midweek lunch/dinner, \u00a322 for three courses; Friday dinner-Sunday lunch, \u00a331 for five courses.

And Stockholm hotels, packed during the week with business people and bureaucrats,are prepared to discount at weekends. </p> <p><strong> What to see</strong><br> </p> <p> First buy a Stockholm Card (Skr220/\u00a315 for 24 hours, children \u00a34 from any tourist office or the Hotellcentralen at Central Station) which gives you unlimited access to virtually all the city's museums, unlimited travel on buses, trams, ferries and the metro system (T-bana), as well as substantial discounts on boat trips and tours. </p> <p>At the top of your itinerary must be a wander round the Old Town, Gamla Stan, with its maze of narrow cobbled streets and tall honey-coloured buildings. The <strong> Riksdaghuset</strong> (Parliament House) has free guided tours in English at 1.30pm at weekends. Close by is the baroque royal palace <strong> Kungliga Slottet</strong>. The 15th-century <strong> Storkyrkan</strong> (The Great Church) is the nearest Stockholm gets to a cathedral, with a far more ornate interior than you might expect of a Lutheran church. </p> <p>From the southern end of Gamla Stan, take the ferry to Djurg rden. This large green island used to be a royal hunting park but now houses the <strong> Skansen</strong>, the world's first open-air museum. Cottages and working villages show typical Swedish dwellings and lifestyles from centuries past. There's also an enclosure of Nordic animals, including elk, bear and wolf. But the must-see on this island is <strong> Vasamuseet</strong> where the restored 17th-century warship Vasa is housed. After sinking on its maiden voyage in 1628, this massive ship was preserved in mud for over three centuries. In an incredible feat of engi neering, the ship was raised intact in the 60s and brought to its new home. Truly awesome. </p> <p><strong> Where to eat</strong><br> </p> <p> Eating out needn't be pricey. As well as the ubiquitous tunnbr\u00f6drulle - a delicious snack consisting of a frankfurter, mashed potato, salad and relish rolled up inside a bread pancake, costing about \u00a32.20 - most restaurants offer a fixed-price lunch - dagens r\u00e4tt - for a little over \u00a34. Great value traditional Swedish lunches are also served in the beer halls of S\u00f6dermalm. </p> <p>If you're on a tight budget, head for the underground market <strong> H\u00f6torgshallen </strong> on H\u00f6torget, a square on Norrmalm's main street Kungsgatan. At the back is a fantastic stall-come-caf\u00e9 serving an amazing fish soup for around \u00a34 including bread and salad, and if you're really hungry refills are free. Expect to queue. </p> <p>Evening meals are generally more expensive, and wine starts at around \u00a315. On Gamla Stan, you can eat very well at reasonable prices at <strong> Costas</strong> (Lilla Nygatan 21, no need to book, around \u00a335 for two with beers). </p> <p>Probably the best restaurant on Gamla Stan is <strong> Leijontornet</strong> (Lilla Nygatan 5, tel 00 46 8 14 23 55), a vaulted cellar under the Victory Hotel; the centrepiece is a 13th-century section of the city wall. The menu combines traditional Swedish dishes with modern European cuisine, but at around \u00a340 for three courses, it doesn't come cheap, although there is a fixed-price menu at about \u00a330 a head, and the bistro upstairs is cheaper. </p> <p><strong> Berns </strong> (Berzelli Park, Nybroplan, tel: 00 46 8 566 322 22) has been popular with Stockholmers since the 19th century; local writer August Strindberg drew the inspiration for his novel The Red Room from here. The bistro next door offers a reasonably-priced alternative to the main restaurant's formality; three courses shouldn't set you back any more than \u00a322. </p> <p><strong> Bars and nightlife</strong><br> </p> <p> Stockholm claims to have more bars per capita than any other European city. Beer is slightly more expensive than the UK, around \u00a32.50-\u00a33 for a 400ml glass, and comes in three strengths; avoid the weakest unless you plan to be drinking all day. </p> <p>Take the T-bana to Medborgarplatsen and head for <strong> Pelikan</strong> (Blekingegatan 40). This fantastic old beer hall has an implausibly high ceiling and is full of character. </p> <p>The nearby <strong> Kvarnen</strong>, (Tj\u00e4rhovsgtan 4) is another a bohemian watering-hole, where journalists and artists mingle with supporters of local football club Hammarby. </p> <p>Behind is S\u00f6dermalm's trendiest bar, the seriously minimalist <strong> H20</strong>. </p> <p>It's also worth visiting <strong> Gondolen</strong> (Stadsg rden 6, T-bana Slussen), a penthouse bar at the northern end of S\u00f6der malm, opposite Gamla Stan. Entrance is via a lift and the bar affords fantastic views of Stockholm, especially at night. </p> <p>Most of the best clubs are in Norrmalm. They're open until 5am and drinks cost much the same as in the bars. The trendiest is <strong> Spybar</strong> (Birger Jarlsgatan 20, tel: 00 46 8 545 037 04, fax 00 46 8 545 03709). Popular with visiting celebs, you either need to be one of the beautiful people to get in or blag your way on to the guest list. To do this, send a fax to the number above, two days in advance. Admission is around \u00a37. </p> <p>Otherwise, aim for <strong> Sturecompaniet</strong> (Sturegallerian 30, tel: 00 46 8 611 78 00), a club on several floors with a huge Gothic atrium that serves as a dance floor. Mainly dance music, admission costs about \u00a36. </p> <p><strong> Where to stay</strong><br> </p> <p> Aim for the Old Town if possible; it's charming, compact and - best of all - central. </p> <p>On Gamla Stan, <strong> Lady Hamilton Hotel</strong> (Storkyrkobrinken 5, tel: 00 46 8 506 401 00) combines antique charm with all modern luxuries. Double rooms from \u00a3130. </p> <p>The <strong> Rica City Gamla Stan</strong> (Lilla Nygatan 25) is an elegant hotel with reasonable rates (doubles from \u00a385). Its sister hotel in Norrmalm (Kungsgatan, tel: 00 46 8 723 72 20) offers doubles at just \u00a353 if you don't want a view. </p> <p>And <strong> AF Chapman</strong> (tel: 00 46 8 463 22 66) is a fully-rigged sailing ship, now centrally moored and doubling as a youth hostel.

      "body": "<p>The first glimpse that tens of thousands of travellers have of France is Calais' spaghetti swirl of road between belching refineries. But, although lacking the picturesque qualities of Roscoff, St Malo or Dieppe, the port is not without advantages. </p> <p>The volume of traffic means that if you miss your booked crossing or if your carrier is on strike at Dover or Folkestone, you have easier alternatives than the horrors that my family has endured of a forced drive from Newhaven to Dover when problems have hit the Newhaven-Dieppe route. </p> <p>Competition at Calais between rival carriers P&amp;O Stena, SeaFrance, Hoverspeed and Eurotunnel has led to price benefits for the consumer. All have different styles. P&amp;O is the brashest with more shopping, but with Club Class seclusion and priority booking available. SeaFrance bills itself as France already, with brasseries right in the bow and crashing waves through the windows to add spectacle. Hoverspeed with upgraded faster craft, has plush on-board facilities and first class for priority loading and food. </p> <p>Eurotunnel has the fastest crossing, minimal weather problems, plus the advantage for pet owners or the disabled of travelling in your car, without the hassle of leaving Fido alone or negotiating stairs yourself. Its club class is pricey - but lets you queue jump to board the next crossing ahead of non-club cars. Useful at peak time. </p> <p>Ports further south offer better ambience for the first cup of French coffee and less time, petrol and temper expended on motorways, but noticeably fewer bargains. </p> <p>All the Calais operators had book-early-for-summer packages and now the new range of offers is beginning to percolate through, although officially summer brochure prices prevail. P&amp;O is offering a \u00a330 meal voucher with some fares, for instance. Eurotunnel has insurance deals. Depending on how busy the season proves, more offers will surface. When you are booking, check for new offers. No brochure price is immutable. </p> <p>Remember also that price should be weighed in the balance with the cost of a long road slog. And all cross-Channel operators have other offers, often with stopovers, and deals are to be found through membership clubs, from caravan owners to vintage cars, to the carriers' own frequent travellers' schemes. Look out for loss leaders, especially from the new internet companies. </p> <p>Sometimes, there is nothing better than a stop over. French hotels are generally better and cheaper than British ones, as are B&amp;Bs, Chambre de H\u00f4tes. There are stop-over packages aplenty. Some are determinedly French; those of Chez-Nous as determinedly English or English speaking. Apart from the mid-July to mid-August French holiday weeks, particularly the ultimate Continental Bank Holiday of August 15, if you are equipped with a Logis, or G\u00eete or camping site guide - most available from the French tourist office, Maison de la France - problems finding accomodation are rare. </p> <p>This side of the Channel, the first decision is the choice of ports. If you live in Edinburgh, Dover is a lousy option when you have P&amp;O North Sea in Hull. They take you overnight to Zeebrugge, and from there the drive to Paris is more scenic than the M1 through Birmingham and only 20 miles further than Calais to Paris. </p> <p>Similarly, Portsmouth, Plymouth and Poole all suit some better. St Malo and Roscoff, quaint small ports both, deliver you into Brittany or the south of Normandy, but for the Mediterranean, a better bet is Le Havre, Caen or even Calais and the motorway network. For Paris, Calais, Caen or Le Havre have direct motorways, but Dieppe is closest and only 20 miles from the motorway. </p> <p>Brittany Ferries, operating Plymouth-Roscoff, Portsmouth-Caen, and Poole- St Malo, has a range of midweek deals - and an advantage that P&amp;O lost when it split into separate operations. You can take one port out and another in, say Caen out, if you fancy a meander, taking advantage of the wealth of journey-breaking offers, from chateaux to campsites, and Roscoff return. A joint arrangement with the smallest of the carriers, Condor Ferries, operating from Poole to St Malo via the Channel Islands, offers a fourth permutation for foot passengers. </p> <p> For them, Condor Ferries provides an interesting crossing, especially if you fancy a couple of days in the Channel Islands. Cars cannot be disembarked, but Condor is the only carrier offering duty free, since the Channel Islands remain \"foreign\" for Customs. </p> <p>It seems madness that P&amp;O Stena, P&amp;O Portsmouth and P&amp;O North Sea cannot sell a joint return package, say Dover-Calais out, Cherbourg-Portsmouth home. You can buy two singles - but that rules out cheap packages. P&amp;O Portsmouth can do its own mix - say Bilbao one way and Le Havre the other, for the Normandy beaches or Bayeux and its tapestry. Bilbao, useful for the South of France, seems expensive, about \u00a3300 extra for a family, but it is a 36-hour trip, therefore a mini-cruise, for those who fancy cruising. But for three related companies not to be able to offer combined deals seems like missing a trick. </p> <p>Across the Channel, the question of diversity is exercising French unions and politicians, concerned that the number of ports is shrinking. Dieppe town council is up in arms about the Newhaven crossing. The French railway company, SNCF, which owns SeaFrance, used to operate the route, but the company shows no interest now. The only operator is Hoverspeed which runs a seasonal fast-craft service from March 31 to the end of October. Hoverspeed has declared that it is committed to Newhaven-Dieppe, but since it pulled out of Dover-Boulogne last September, leaving Boulogne with no passenger carrier, the French are wary. </p> <p>Seine-Maritime Department, Dieppe's parent authority, is negotiating with the owners of Hoverspeed, Sea Containers, to buy the Newhaven Port. With an Italian carrier, Corsica Ferries, it plans to restart a traditional ferry service, closed three years ago by P&amp;O Stena. </p> <p>Boulogne has the advantage over Dieppe of being as easy to reach from Calais Port as is Calais town centre, but it is still a pity we passengers have lost the option of going straight into its harbour. </p> <p>Hoverspeed, which says it could not justify maintaining two operations 20 miles apart, has invested this year in new Superseacats, which went into operation Dover-Calais and Dover-Ostend last month. A three-year-old Seacat will upgrade Newhaven-Dieppe. The Dover-Calais journey time will be cut to 40 minutes, the shortest sea crossing, only five minutes longer than Eurotunnel.</p> <p><strong>The options</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.brittanyferries.com\">Brittany Ferries</a><br> Reservations 0990 360360</p> <p>Portsmouth-Caen/ St Malo, Plymouth-Roscoff/ Santander, Poole-Cherbourg.

Windows were broken and covered with chickenwire.</p> <p>Five flights up, along a corridor, the one-bedroom flat was not too bad, although it had cracks in the walls and badly needed a paint. Hobsons Place is not the worst towerblock in east London and it may not even be the worst in Tower Hamlets.</p> <p>To David Shackson, 31, a special educational needs and history teacher at Morpeth comprehensive in nearby Bethnal Green, it was a strange way of offering an incentive to stay working in the borough.</p> <p>Hobsons Place was offered him through the council's key workers' scheme - low-cost housing for public sector workers. He saw a notice in December and thought it might reduce his \u00a3110-a-week rent, out of his \u00a325,000-a-year salary.</p> <p><b> Priority</b><br></p> <p>With a reference from his headteacher, he was soon on a waiting list and awarded \"300 priority points\"; to this day he has no idea what that means. In February, he was told a property was available in Hobsons Place. A woman from Tower Hamlets Community Housing, the association which owns the block, showed him round. The flat was \u00a356 a week until it was refurbished, when it would be \u00a380; the council is promising a \u00a34m refit of the block starting next month. He had to take the property straight away, regardless of his month's notice, or be struck off the list. Hobsons Place became Hobson's choice. But he turned it down.</p> <p>\"I have worked in Tower Hamlets for six years and I have visited many council properties. Today I was taken to one of the worst I have seen,\" Mr Shackson said in a letter to the council's lettings coordinator. \"Had I been starting my first teaching position, the sort of person for which I would hope your scheme was targeted, I would not only have refused the flat but would also have reconsidered working in Tower Hamlets.\"</p> <p>He added: \"I applied to the scheme in good faith in the belief that it was there to provide affordable housing to teachers in the area in which they work ...My experience has proven that the scheme was not genuine in this purpose.\"</p> <p>He says he is not fussy. Across the way is Ramar House, another towerblock, where he would have been happy to go, because there is a porter and much better security.</p> <p>When the Guardian made inquiries, Tower Hamlets replied speedily and frankly. The scheme started in December, with 50 council and housing association homes. The council had 104 calls, 42 applications, and made 13 offers; eight were accepted and five refused. The scheme is open to teachers but is to take in health workers, police and the fire brigade. The council acknowledges that the scheme enables these workers to jump the list. A teacher couple from New Zealand has accepted the flat offered to Mr Shackson.</p> <p>\"There is a shortage in the borough, 15,500 households on the list,\" said a council spokesman. \"In terms of people it could be five times that. We get 2,000 lets per year - there is enormous pressure. We offer what we offer anyone else on ourlist. There is pressure to turn round property quickly and also pressure to get applicants to accept or not accept the offer.\"</p> <p>Rob Lantsbury, for the housing association, said: \"Unfortunately a lot of housing in Tower Hamlets is in similar condition ...It's fair to say it's going to look a lot different in six months' time.\"</p> <p>This week the education secretary, David Blunkett, announced \u00a335m for next year to schools in 58 authorities with recruitment problems. Tower Hamlets is getting \u00a3696,000. But this can be spread widely - housing subsidies, support for childcare, travel costs, recruitment campaigns, or, most likely, extra pay.</p> <p>Ministers say schools can best decide how the money is spent. \"They can use it if they want for housing,\" an education department spokesman said. \"They can innovate where there are problems. We are just trying to stimulate ideas.\"</p> <p>Some gaps are being filled piecemeal. In a report this week, the National Housing Federation highlighted Northwick Park in Harrow, north-west London, where 668 units have been built for health workers, mostly flats but 40 two- and three-bed homes. In Hoxton Square in Hackney, 48 flats are being provided as affordable homes for key workers.</p> <p><b> Sceptical</b><br></p> <p>The government is spending \u00a3250m on new and improved housing for key workers over three years. Its aim is to house 10,000 workers, though the federation is sceptical. Organisations are bidding to run schemes, but lenders have been very reluctant to commit and give extra leverage by offering low-cost mortgages.</p> <p>The average start for teachers in inner London is going up to \u00a320,000, and many experienced teachers will be just short of \u00a330,000 with London weighting. But according to the federation, rents average \u00a3200 a week for a one-bedroom flat and an average London house costs \u00a3150,000. Meanwhile the National Institute of Social and Economic Research estimates that 60,000 workers in key services will leave London over the next 10 years. A report by the University of North London identified many teachers leaving London after five years to buy homes. About 40% expect to have to leave.</p> <p>\"If the government is serious, they have got to build up new housing,\" says Mr Shackson. \"The intentions are right, but it's really appalling to be keeping council tenants on the waiting lists to make available places for key workers.\" In the meantime, he is staying where he is.</p> <p>\"Its not going to force me to leave the job. I'm getting by. I probably will apply for promotion - the extra money will cover things. I've got that option, but for anyone just beginning the salary rate is atrocious. I don't know how they survive.\"</p>",

Hobsons Place was offered him through the council's key workers' scheme - low-cost housing for public sector workers. He saw a notice in December and thought it might reduce his \u00a3110-a-week rent, out of his \u00a325,000-a-year salary. Priority With a reference from his headteacher, he was soon on a waiting list and awarded \"300 priority points\"; to this day he has no idea what that means. In February, he was told a property was available in Hobsons Place. A woman from Tower Hamlets Community Housing, the association which owns the block, showed him round. The flat was \u00a356 a week until it was refurbished, when it would be \u00a380; the council is promising a \u00a34m refit of the block starting next month. He had to take the property straight away, regardless of his month's notice, or be struck off the list. Hobsons Place became Hobson's choice. But he turned it down. \"I have worked in Tower Hamlets for six years and I have visited many council properties. Today I was taken to one of the worst I have seen,\" Mr Shackson said in a letter to the council's lettings coordinator. \"Had I been starting my first teaching position, the sort of person for which I would hope your scheme was targeted, I would not only have refused the flat but would also have reconsidered working in Tower Hamlets.\" He added: \"I applied to the scheme in good faith in the belief that it was there to provide affordable housing to teachers in the area in which they work ...My experience has proven that the scheme was not genuine in this purpose.\" He says he is not fussy. Across the way is Ramar House, another towerblock, where he would have been happy to go, because there is a porter and much better security. When the Guardian made inquiries, Tower Hamlets replied speedily and frankly. The scheme started in December, with 50 council and housing association homes. The council had 104 calls, 42 applications, and made 13 offers; eight were accepted and five refused. The scheme is open to teachers but is to take in health workers, police and the fire brigade. The council acknowledges that the scheme enables these workers to jump the list. A teacher couple from New Zealand has accepted the flat offered to Mr Shackson. \"There is a shortage in the borough, 15,500 households on the list,\" said a council spokesman. \"In terms of people it could be five times that. We get 2,000 lets per year - there is enormous pressure. We offer what we offer anyone else on ourlist. There is pressure to turn round property quickly and also pressure to get applicants to accept or not accept the offer.\" Rob Lantsbury, for the housing association, said: \"Unfortunately a lot of housing in Tower Hamlets is in similar condition ...It's fair to say it's going to look a lot different in six months' time.\" This week the education secretary, David Blunkett, announced \u00a335m for next year to schools in 58 authorities with recruitment problems. Tower Hamlets is getting \u00a3696,000. But this can be spread widely - housing subsidies, support for childcare, travel costs, recruitment campaigns, or, most likely, extra pay. Ministers say schools can best decide how the money is spent. \"They can use it if they want for housing,\" an education department spokesman said. \"They can innovate where there are problems. We are just trying to stimulate ideas.\" Some gaps are being filled piecemeal. In a report this week, the National Housing Federation highlighted Northwick Park in Harrow, north-west London, where 668 units have been built for health workers, mostly flats but 40 two- and three-bed homes. In Hoxton Square in Hackney, 48 flats are being provided as affordable homes for key workers. Sceptical The government is spending \u00a3250m on new and improved housing for key workers over three years. Its aim is to house 10,000 workers, though the federation is sceptical. Organisations are bidding to run schemes, but lenders have been very reluctant to commit and give extra leverage by offering low-cost mortgages. The average start for teachers in inner London is going up to \u00a320,000, and many experienced teachers will be just short of \u00a330,000 with London weighting. But according to the federation, rents average \u00a3200 a week for a one-bedroom flat and an average London house costs \u00a3150,000. Meanwhile the National Institute of Social and Economic Research estimates that 60,000 workers in key services will leave London over the next 10 years. A report by the University of North London identified many teachers leaving London after five years to buy homes. About 40% expect to have to leave. \"If the government is serious, they have got to build up new housing,\" says Mr Shackson. \"The intentions are right, but it's really appalling to be keeping council tenants on the waiting lists to make available places for key workers.\" In the meantime, he is staying where he is. \"Its not going to force me to leave the job. I'm getting by. I probably will apply for promotion - the extra money will cover things. I've got that option, but for anyone just beginning the salary rate is atrocious. I don't know how they survive.\"",

      "body": "<p>There are many different kinds of coastal walking, from trudging through sandy dunes to crunching across pebble beaches, to wandering along airy promenades along switchback cliffs, making the coast one of the most fascinating of walking destinations. The following are some suggestions for varied coastal walks throughout the country.</p> <p><strong> Bamburgh, Northumberland </strong><br> </p> <p> The dramatic outline of William Armstrong's mock-medieval castle soaring above the sweeping sandy beach at Bamburgh on the Northumberland coast will seem familiar to many. It has been used as the backdrop to countless films, from The Lion in Winter to many more recent historical epics. </p> <p>What we see of the castle today is largely the creation of the 1st Lord Armstrong of Cragside, a gritty northern industrialist who bought the castle in 1894 and completed a thoroughgoing restoration in 1903. The site itself, on a bold crag of Whin Sill basalt, is, however, very ancient, and fortresses here date back to the Iron Age. </p> <p>There are fine walks on the firm golden sands as far as Seahouses to the south (about three miles) and out to Budle Bay with its lighthouse to the north. If you have the time, don't miss Billy Shiel's invitation for a boat trip out to the rocky Farne Islands, the final outcrop of the Whin Sill, from Seahouses, and enjoy close-up views of grey seals, cormorants, guillimots and kittiwakes. </p> <p><strong>Contact:</strong> Bamburgh Castle (01668 214515). For Billy Shiel's boat trips to the Farnes, call 01665 721006.<br><strong> Recommended pub:</strong> The Lord Crewe, Bamburgh. </p> <p><strong> Blakeney Point, Norfolk</strong><br> </p> <p> Seven glorious miles of shingle-walking awaits the visitor to Blakeney Point on the north Norfolk coast. At its western end, the point curves inland like a crooked hand to protect the maze of mud flats and salt marshes of Morston and Stiffkey Marshes and the National Nature Reserve (closed) of Holkham. </p> <p>Access to the Point is either by ferry from Morston, or a four-and-a-half-mile walk along the shingle bank from Cley Eye on Cley Beach. On the walk, you will pass a range of classic coastal habitats, from sand and pebble beaches, to salt marsh and sand dunes. </p> <p>More than 260 species of birds have been recorded at Blakeney, and the spit includes breeding colonies of common, Sandwich, Arctic and little terns, ringed plover and oystercatchers - truly the clowns of the coast. But one of the wildlife highlights of any visit to Blakeney will be sighting the common and grey seals which breed off the point of the spit, and can often be seen at close range from the ferry boat. </p> <p>Further south down the North Sea coast, Dunwich Beach (National Trust) is also open, where little now remains of the once-important medieval port of Dunwich. This was a thriving township with 5,000 inhabitants and boasting three churches, but it fell victim to the erosion of its cliff-top position by the North Sea over several centuries. </p> <p><strong>Contact:</strong> Joe Read at the National Trust on 01263 740241; the ferry operators at Morston are John Bean on 01263 740038, or Jim Temple on 01263 740791. <br><strong>Recommended pub:</strong> The Anchor at Morston. </p> <p><strong> Dungeness, Kent</strong><br> </p> <p> The shingle promontory of Dungeness in Kent is one of the strangest landscapes in Britain. The five-mile foreshore running north from the shanty-town village is backed by the massive, threatening Lego blocks of the twin Dungeness nuclear power stations. The eccentric collection of railway carriageways, prefabs and huts, including the former home of the writer and artist Derek Jarman and various other artists and fishermen, must be one of the oddest settlements in the country. There are also the remains of no less than three lighthouses which have been built on this most dangerous of Channel coasts. </p> <p>The shingle foreshore itself makes for difficult walking, but a concrete road runs parallel to the beach leading past the strange concrete listening posts, the forerunners of radar. The whole of this otherworld landscape seems, like your footing, to be constantly on the move. Even the toughest of plants have a battle to survive on this inhospitable terrain, but some national rarities, such as the edible sea kale, sea campion, thrift and the aptly-named stonecrop, can be found here, eking out a living from the barren pebbles. </p> <p>Dungeness is an important bird habitat, attracting a rich variety of wildfowl and waders in the gravel pits behind Denge Beach, and rarities such as the dark-hooded Mediterranean gull and Sandwich terns on the shingle. Even the humming power station buildings provide nest sites for black redstarts. </p> <p>You can either walk south from Dymchurch to the Bird Observatory at Dungeness past Greatstone and Littlestone on Sea, catching the Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway back to your starting point. Or you could do the whole thing in reverse. </p> <p><strong>Contact:</strong> Rye TIC, The Heritage Centre, Strand Quay, Rye, (01797 226696). <br><strong>Recommended pub:</strong> Delicious fish and chips at The Britannia, Dungeness. </p> <p><strong> Formby, Lancashire </strong><br> </p> <p> The red squirrels of the rather grandly named Formby Hills, north of the Mersey estuary, are busy mating at the moment, so there's a good chance to see them while they are off-guard. The Squirrel Walk, through the ancient Scots pines of this 500-acre National Trust property, is still open to visitors, as is the six-mile coastal walk, which will take you north to the genteel Victorian and Edwardian resort of Southport. </p> <p>The Formby Hills are said to be the fourth largest sand dune system in Britain and although they are impressive, they do not reach any great heights. This popular National Trust property includes inter-tidal sand flats and the dunes are backed by Scots pine plantations, planted at the turn of the last century in an attempt to stabilise them. It was also the site of the first lifeboat station in the country, opened in 1804. </p> <p>There are many walks through the dunes, which is also the home of the rare natterjack toad, creeping willow and dewberry. But no horses are allowed and all dogs must be kept on a lead, with walkers restricted to the coastal fringe. And if you are really lucky, and there at low tide, you might just catch a glimpse of signs left by the first visitors to this beautiful spot, over 5,000 years ago. Fossilised human footprints and animal hoofmarks dated to the Neolithic period have been found in the inter-tidal sediments. </p> <p><strong>Contact:</strong> The National Trust (01704 878591). <br><strong>Recommended pub:</strong> The Pine Woods, Wicks Green, Formby. </p> <p><strong> Pembrokeshire Beaches, Dyfed</strong><br> </p> <p> It's no wonder that the Pembrokeshire coast is the home of British surfing. Great rollers crash in unhindered after their 3,000-mile journey across the Atlantic on to a range of superb beaches of golden sand, backed by multi-coloured cliffs. </p> <p>And although you can't enjoy the pleasures of the wonderful Pembrokeshire Coast Path at present, most of the beaches which can be reached by road are open to the public to walk on, paddle in, or simply watch the Welsh beach boys as they ride in on the endless surf. </p> <p>One of the best and certainly the wildest is Freshwater West, near Castlemartin, an impressive sweep of dune-backed sands which receives the biggest waves in Pembrokeshire. At high tide, however, most of the sand is submerged and only a pebble and shingle bank remains; at low tide, the remains of a 6,000-year-old drowned forest are sometimes revealed. Freshwater West has something for everyone, for at the southern end of the beach, near a restored seaweed-collector's hut, there is an abundance of rock pools to keep the children, and many adults, occupied. </p> <p>Nearby is secluded West Angle Bay at the entrance to the Milford Haven waterway, where there are more rock pools for the kids to explore, and to the east, beyond the Castlemartin Army ranges, are the National Trust beaches of Broad Haven. Just inland from here are the famous Bosherton Lily Ponds on the Stackpole Estate, the home of otter, waterfowl and waders.</p> <p><strong> Contact:</strong> Pembrokeshire Tourism on 01437 760980. <br><strong>Recommended pub:</strong> The Sloop at Porthgain. </p>",

      "bodyText": "There are many different kinds of coastal walking, from trudging through sandy dunes to crunching across pebble beaches, to wandering along airy promenades along switchback cliffs, making the coast one of the most fascinating of walking destinations. The following are some suggestions for varied coastal walks throughout the country. Bamburgh, Northumberland The dramatic outline of William Armstrong's mock-medieval castle soaring above the sweeping sandy beach at Bamburgh on the Northumberland coast will seem familiar to many. It has been used as the backdrop to countless films, from The Lion in Winter to many more recent historical epics. What we see of the castle today is largely the creation of the 1st Lord Armstrong of Cragside, a gritty northern industrialist who bought the castle in 1894 and completed a thoroughgoing restoration in 1903. The site itself, on a bold crag of Whin Sill basalt, is, however, very ancient, and fortresses here date back to the Iron Age. There are fine walks on the firm golden sands as far as Seahouses to the south (about three miles) and out to Budle Bay with its lighthouse to the north. If you have the time, don't miss Billy Shiel's invitation for a boat trip out to the rocky Farne Islands, the final outcrop of the Whin Sill, from Seahouses, and enjoy close-up views of grey seals, cormorants, guillimots and kittiwakes. Contact: Bamburgh Castle (01668 214515). For Billy Shiel's boat trips to the Farnes, call 01665 721006. Recommended pub: The Lord Crewe, Bamburgh. Blakeney Point, Norfolk Seven glorious miles of shingle-walking awaits the visitor to Blakeney Point on the north Norfolk coast. At its western end, the point curves inland like a crooked hand to protect the maze of mud flats and salt marshes of Morston and Stiffkey Marshes and the National Nature Reserve (closed) of Holkham. Access to the Point is either by ferry from Morston, or a four-and-a-half-mile walk along the shingle bank from Cley Eye on Cley Beach. On the walk, you will pass a range of classic coastal habitats, from sand and pebble beaches, to salt marsh and sand dunes. More than 260 species of birds have been recorded at Blakeney, and the spit includes breeding colonies of common, Sandwich, Arctic and little terns, ringed plover and oystercatchers - truly the clowns of the coast. But one of the wildlife highlights of any visit to Blakeney will be sighting the common and grey seals which breed off the point of the spit, and can often be seen at close range from the ferry boat. Further south down the North Sea coast, Dunwich Beach (National Trust) is also open, where little now remains of the once-important medieval port of Dunwich. This was a thriving township with 5,000 inhabitants and boasting three churches, but it fell victim to the erosion of its cliff-top position by the North Sea over several centuries. Contact: Joe Read at the National Trust on 01263 740241; the ferry operators at Morston are John Bean on 01263 740038, or Jim Temple on 01263 740791. Recommended pub: The Anchor at Morston. Dungeness, Kent The shingle promontory of Dungeness in Kent is one of the strangest landscapes in Britain. The five-mile foreshore running north from the shanty-town village is backed by the massive, threatening Lego blocks of the twin Dungeness nuclear power stations. The eccentric collection of railway carriageways, prefabs and huts, including the former home of the writer and artist Derek Jarman and various other artists and fishermen, must be one of the oddest settlements in the country. There are also the remains of no less than three lighthouses which have been built on this most dangerous of Channel coasts. The shingle foreshore itself makes for difficult walking, but a concrete road runs parallel to the beach leading past the strange concrete listening posts, the forerunners of radar. The whole of this otherworld landscape seems, like your footing, to be constantly on the move. Even the toughest of plants have a battle to survive on this inhospitable terrain, but some national rarities, such as the edible sea kale, sea campion, thrift and the aptly-named stonecrop, can be found here, eking out a living from the barren pebbles. Dungeness is an important bird habitat, attracting a rich variety of wildfowl and waders in the gravel pits behind Denge Beach, and rarities such as the dark-hooded Mediterranean gull and Sandwich terns on the shingle. Even the humming power station buildings provide nest sites for black redstarts. You can either walk south from Dymchurch to the Bird Observatory at Dungeness past Greatstone and Littlestone on Sea, catching the Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway back to your starting point. Or you could do the whole thing in reverse. Contact: Rye TIC, The Heritage Centre, Strand Quay, Rye, (01797 226696). Recommended pub: Delicious fish and chips at The Britannia, Dungeness. Formby, Lancashire The red squirrels of the rather grandly named Formby Hills, north of the Mersey estuary, are busy mating at the moment, so there's a good chance to see them while they are off-guard. The Squirrel Walk, through the ancient Scots pines of this 500-acre National Trust property, is still open to visitors, as is the six-mile coastal walk, which will take you north to the genteel Victorian and Edwardian resort of Southport. The Formby Hills are said to be the fourth largest sand dune system in Britain and although they are impressive, they do not reach any great heights. This popular National Trust property includes inter-tidal sand flats and the dunes are backed by Scots pine plantations, planted at the turn of the last century in an attempt to stabilise them. It was also the site of the first lifeboat station in the country, opened in 1804. There are many walks through the dunes, which is also the home of the rare natterjack toad, creeping willow and dewberry. But no horses are allowed and all dogs must be kept on a lead, with walkers restricted to the coastal fringe. And if you are really lucky, and there at low tide, you might just catch a glimpse of signs left by the first visitors to this beautiful spot, over 5,000 years ago. Fossilised human footprints and animal hoofmarks dated to the Neolithic period have been found in the inter-tidal sediments. Contact: The National Trust (01704 878591). Recommended pub: The Pine Woods, Wicks Green, Formby. Pembrokeshire Beaches, Dyfed It's no wonder that the Pembrokeshire coast is the home of British surfing. Great rollers crash in unhindered after their 3,000-mile journey across the Atlantic on to a range of superb beaches of golden sand, backed by multi-coloured cliffs. And although you can't enjoy the pleasures of the wonderful Pembrokeshire Coast Path at present, most of the beaches which can be reached by road are open to the public to walk on, paddle in, or simply watch the Welsh beach boys as they ride in on the endless surf. One of the best and certainly the wildest is Freshwater West, near Castlemartin, an impressive sweep of dune-backed sands which receives the biggest waves in Pembrokeshire. At high tide, however, most of the sand is submerged and only a pebble and shingle bank remains; at low tide, the remains of a 6,000-year-old drowned forest are sometimes revealed. Freshwater West has something for everyone, for at the southern end of the beach, near a restored seaweed-collector's hut, there is an abundance of rock pools to keep the children, and many adults, occupied. Nearby is secluded West Angle Bay at the entrance to the Milford Haven waterway, where there are more rock pools for the kids to explore, and to the east, beyond the Castlemartin Army ranges, are the National Trust beaches of Broad Haven. Just inland from here are the famous Bosherton Lily Ponds on the Stackpole Estate, the home of otter, waterfowl and waders. Contact: Pembrokeshire Tourism on 01437 760980. Recommended pub: The Sloop at Porthgain.",

      "body": "<p>For someone who had supposedly just been demoted, Chris Smith looked pretty cheerful when he was appointed secretary of state for national heritage in 1997. His last post in opposition had been shadow health secretary, but the arts world had lobbied Tony Blair for Smith's appointment, having been impressed with his shadowing of heritage in the mid 90s. As the prime minister put it to him, \"you're a victim of your own success\". So a smiling Smith stepped outside 10 Downing Street, made a bullish statement about the importance of the creative industries, scrapped the dreadful heritage name and launched the ministry of culture, media and sport.</p> <p>There was no doubt he was the best candidate. He had a PhD in romantic poetry, his love of hill walking fitted with the tourism part of the job, his support for Arsenal covered sport, and as a regular gallery, concert, theatre and cinema goer, he had a genuine love and appreciation of the arts. And just as importantly, he was a seasoned politician. His initial claim to prominence might have come in 1984, when he became the first openly out gay MP at Westminster, but since then he had held a series of significant shadow frontbench posts covering the treasury, environment and social security, as well as heritage and health.</p> <p>However, soon after his appointment things began to turn sour, with theatrical knights taking it in turn to heap abuse on him. \"We hoped that this government would make us feel treasured. They haven't,\" intoned Sir Peter Hall, solemnly. Equally unsettling were the persistent rumours that Peter Mandelson was stalking his job.</p> <p>\"The first two years were undoubtedly difficult,\" Smith now acknowledges, \"mainly because we kept to Tory spending plans. There was a period when I could hardly go to an awards ceremony without being berated from the stage by some panjandrum complaining that government was not putting enough money in the arts.\"</p> <p>But it wasn't just a lack of cash that took the gloss off Smith and the then voguish concept of Cool Britannia (which Smith goes out of his way to distance himself from, pointing out that it was his Tory predecessor, Virginia Bottomley, who jumped on that particular bandwagon, using the words five times in press releases during her last year in power). Disproportionately time-consuming were the fall-out over fat cats running the lottery, the ongoing Millennium Dome saga, funding crises at Covent Garden, and disputes over the new Wembley. The absolute low point of Smith's tenure came in 1998 when he published a book of his speeches, Creative Britain. Perhaps it was the Damien Hirst book jacket, or the mood of the times, but Smith and the book were slaughtered by reviewers. \"An insult to its readers\", said one; \"unpublishable maudlin trash\", said another.</p> <p>But three years on, and the world has changed again. While many of his colleagues in government struggle to maintain their reputations, Smith is apparently riding high. He is not only one of the few ministers to have been at the same post for the entire life of this government, but he has also synchronised a series of policy triumphs with the electoral timetable. At the moment when it matters most, Chris Smith has all his ducks in a line.</p> <p>Melvyn Bragg - who, it should be said, is also a Labour peer - recently itemised some of Smith's achievements in a newspaper article: a seven-year secure financial base for the BBC; free museum access for all, which has already increased visitor numbers by 20% for children and 40% for pensioners; hugely increased funding, which has meant extra money for regional theatre; partnerships between arts professionals and schools in deprived areas; and a pledge that all children will have access to musical tuition. In the pipeline are ambitious proposals for the major artistic institutions, as well as for individual artists. \"The polite, rather fastidious arts lover has delivered,\" wrote Bragg. \"Now that the smoke has cleared, Chris Smith can be seen as the unlikely bespectacled hero in a western, the guy who won the shoot-out.\"</p> <p>Seeing Smith arrive at his Trafalgar Square office, he unwittingly plays out a perfect tableau to illustrate his job. In one hand he holds a ministerial red box, in the other a dinner jacket. \"I'm going to the National Gallery trustees dinner this evening,\" he explains, \"but I suppose these two things do sort of sum up the job.\"</p> <p>In the same way, the art that he has chosen from the government collection for his office also provides a potted biography. A portrait by Scottish artist Craigie Aitchison connects with his Edinburgh upbringing; a large etching of Lake Windermere by Norman Ackroyd chimes with his love of romantic poetry and hill walking; and some architectural shapes by Langlands and Bell, who exhibited in the definitive BritArt show, Sensation, provide a reminder that he is not afraid of the cutting edge. There is also a bright blue Howard Hodgkin lithograph, an Epstein bust of the conductor Klemperer to reflect his interest in music, and the politician's common touch is evidenced by a red, white and blue papier-mache raven made by the children of a school he visited.</p> <p>Smith, who is 50 later this year, is a slighter figure than he appears on television and confidently projects a sense of understated straightforwardness. He plainly relishes discussing the ins and outs of social policy, as perhaps befits someone with a family tradition of public service. He is the second son of Colin Smith, a Whitehall civil servant, and Gladys, a maths teacher. The family lived in Watford until Smith was 10, and then moved to Edinburgh when his father was transferred to the Scottish Office and his mother became head of maths at a girls' school. The couple, now both retired, still live in Scotland and Smith's elder brother, Roger, teaches physics at a school there. Friends say the atmosphere in the home was, \"fairly serious and obviously academically inclined\". It was a Christian household, and Smith has been an active member of the Church of Scotland since his teenage years. There were also politics, although his parent's brand wasn't to the young Chris's taste. \"I have to admit that they are both staunch Liberal Democrats,\" he winces.</p> <p>In Edinburgh he attended George Watson's College, which was then a direct grant school and is now independent. Smith supported Labour at elections in the 60s and his friend, Douglas Graham, now a solicitor in Inverness, says Smith's interest in party politics didn't mark him out at all. \"But he wasn't a dominant or a loud character. He was obviously highly intelligent and very determined, but he was always slightly reserved.\"</p> <p>Smith says that, while there was a lot of reading at home, it was through school that he was really exposed to the arts. \"A teacher helped out at the Edinburgh Festival, so we got tickets to concerts and other events. I remember seeing Ian McKellen in both Richard II and Edward II sometime in the late 60s. It bowled me over.\" He did play the piano - \"I got to grade six\" - but his main leisure activity was walking and hill climbing. He introduced the late John Smith to the sport, and he is the only MP who has climbed all the Munros, the 277 Scottish hills over 3,000ft.</p> <p>He started climbing on a school trip when he was 12, and has been hooked ever since. \"It is not only great exercise and a challenge. There is no better antidote to being in the smoke-filled corridors than to be standing on a mountain with half the country laid out before you. It really does put everything else into perspective.\" It is not only because of departmental responsibilities that he has been given the job of speaking up for the tourist industry in the face of the foot and mouth epidemic. Few other members of the cabinet have anything like his empathy for rural Britain.</p> <p>Douglas Graham was present when he completed the last Munro, and says it is a tribute to Smith that friends came from all over Britain to be with him for the occasion. \"It was a typically drizzly sort of day, but we had some champagne and a dram at the top and there was a lot of sincere friendship in evidence. There were people from school and university and politics. It was obvious that high office hadn't changed him as a man.\"</p> <p>Smith's passion for politics and climbing were forged at the same time. He says that, growing up in the 60s, he was aware it was, \"an incredible time of hope and belief that you could change the world\". He had been impressed by the optimism surrounding Harold Wilson coming into office in 1964, and in America by the Kennedy and then Johnson administrations, the civil rights protests and anti-Vietnam war movements. \"And there was my Christian faith. I don't think anyone can sit down and read the Sermon on the Mount without ending up a socialist. All that bundle of emotions about hope and change and democracy led me into the Labour party, and to a considerable extent has sustained me in the Labour party ever since.\"</p> <p>The issues that still most animate him are those of basic equality of opportunity. He proudly praises his former university supervisor, who forged new links between Scottish comprehensives and Oxford colleges, and so enabled their brightest pupils to get to Oxford for the first time. In his current job, he has been a fervent supporter of increased access to cultural institutions.</p> <p>\"The aim of ensuring that the maximum amount of people have access to the best things in life has been at the heart of everything we have tried to do,\" he says. \"It is the lodestone upon which everything else is based. I become very angry at some people who have argued that there are too many people coming into our museums. They regret that what they call the stillness of the old museums has gone. That is an exclusive argument about keeping the best things for the privileged few. It is perfectly possible for someone to have a high-art experience, even if they don't have a high-art background.\"</p> <p>Jude Kelly, artistic director of the Yorkshire playhouse, sees an essentially democratic strand running throughout his policies. \"He knows that if you are really looking for democracy, then that should apply to health and education, and also to culture. Until regions are served with first-class work, then you don't have a democracy, and he is genuinely committed to this.\"</p> <p>As a student reading English at Cambridge in the late 60s, Smith was elected president of the union and chairman of the Fabian society. He took part in his share of demos, but recalls that much of the protest at Cambridge was remarkably genteel. \"There was once a sit-in which lasted three or four days and was enormous fun. But when the vanguard of the invading students first entered the building, they actually stopped and held up the students behind them while they rolled up the William Morris carpet so it wouldn't get damaged.\"</p> <p>A contemporary was Rabbi Julia Neuberger, who remembers him as, \"very clever, even among a lot of very clever people. You could talk to Chris about things you wouldn't talk to other people about. We really would have conversations about Wordsworth.\" She echoes the view that he is largely unchanged. \"I still sometimes want to play the Jewish mother with him and tell him to get more sleep,\" she laughs, \"which is exactly the same as it was when we first met.\"</p> <p>Smith says that at Cambridge, he asked himself if he wanted a life in politics. The answer was, \"yes, probably\", but he felt he had to do other things first. After gaining a double first, he embarked on a PhD about ideas of solitude in 18th-century poetry, with particular emphasis on Wordsworth and Coleridge. He then spent a year at Harvard as a Kennedy scholar.</p> <p>\"I was mainly working on my thesis, but I also hugely enjoyed the experience of being in America. I admired the American way of seeing how something could be done rather than ways that it couldn't. I was there in 75/76, which was post-Watergate and coming up to the bicentennial and presidential elections.\" He worked on Arizona democrat Mo Udall's failed presidential campaign and, on returning to Britain, thought about joining the civil service. \"But I had the perspicacity to know that I would not want to spend my life serving a Tory government. So I worked in housing instead.\"</p> <p>He was taken on as a graduate trainee by the government quango, the Housing Corporation. Nine months later he left to work for the Shaftesbury housing association, a Christian-based organisation that provides sheltered homes for the elderly and disabled. Smith says that even now, when he passes a building he was partly responsible for, he has a small surge of pride.</p> <p>Mick Sweeney, now director of a housing association, was a colleague of Smith and a fellow branch official of their union. \"He didn't put himself about like the stereotype of a politician on the make,\" recalls Sweeney. \"He took his work very seriously, and he believed in providing low-cost housing to people. I think it's quite refreshing that someone like Chris has got the position that he has.\" So unassuming was Smith that when, some years later, another housing colleague attended a conference at which the Labour social security spokesman was speaking, he was amazed that, \"it was that Chris Smith who came on stage. It just never occurred to me that it could be the same person.\"</p> <p>In fact, Smith had begun climbing the political greasy pole when he was elected as an Islington councillor in 1978. The following year he stood in the general election in the unwinnable Tory seat of Epsom and Ewell, and afterwards jokingly confided that his biggest concern while canvassing was to avoid falling in the suburban swimming pools.</p> <p>At Islington he became Labour whip and chair of the housing committee. It was an extremely difficult time, with a split Labour group, over half of whom eventually defected to the SDP. Acrimonious meetings would often carry on through the night as the differing factions cajoled reluctant councillors to vote their way, and it is a measure of Smith's toughness that he survived politically, let alone prospered. His cabinet colleague, Mo Mowlam, says he's always been strong but, \"he's tough in a way that doesn't seem tough. Remember that he got through the dome as the minister responsible. He's not a table-thumping toughie, but he doesn't give in.\"</p> <p>Islington council during this period was the spiritual home of what the tabloids liked to call the loony left. The red flag literally flew over the town hall and the widespread perception that councils such as Islington were more interested in political posturing than providing services reflected badly on Labour nationally. How does he look back on those years? \"Well, I'm proud of many of the actual achievements, such as estate renovation programmes, rehabilitation of street houses, and some children's services,\" he says. \"But I'm not proud of the murky politics. There was a lot of unpleasantness, a lot of sheer difficulty in getting decisions made.\"</p> <p>He says that, as a chair of housing and a housing professional, he became ever more conscious that it was decisions taken by central government that dictated what he was able to do. \"While I had taken socialism on board intellectually, it was while I was a councillor in Islington that I saw people living in poor housing and in poverty and became convinced that government exists to work for people like these. I really wanted to get closer to where the decision-making was in order to make a difference.\" His chance came at the 1983 general election, when he was selected to stand against the sitting Islington MP, George Cunningham, who had defected from Labour to the SDP. It was such a close contest that on his way to the count, Smith's agent advised him to prepare two speeches. After a recount, he eventually won by 363 votes.</p> <p>It was 18 months later that he came out as gay, but contingency plans were in place for the election. \"It was a reasonably well known fact that I was gay, as I'd made no particular secret of it. If it had emerged during the campaign, I would have said yes.\" As an MP he wanted to say something publicly as a way of putting the issue to rest. When, in November 1984, the Conservative-controlled council in Rugby dropped a policy banning discrimination on the grounds of sexuality, Smith was asked to address a protest meeting. A few minutes before he spoke, he decided that this was the moment. His opening line was: \"My name is Chris Smith. I'm the Labour MP for Islington South and Finsbury, and I'm gay.\"</p> <p>While his statement was reported in the press, it didn't spark a tabloid frenzy, and it was four months before the Sun even mentioned it. However, in the next general election campaign in 1987, Smith canvassers had a script as to what to say if anyone raised it. \"The first point,\" he says, \"was, 'isn't it a refreshing change to have a politician who is honest'. The second line was, 'he's a good MP who works hard for everyone'. And the third one, if people really persisted, was, 'you're not telling me you're prejudiced, are you?' No canvasser ever had to get to line number three, and I won with an increased majority.\"</p> <p>Colin Richardson, the editor of Gay Times, says Smith's coming out was obviously important. \"But even more important was when he was re-elected. There was a fear that even though he had what should have been a safe seat, it would rebound. But it was the opposite.\"</p> <p>Smith has said he didn't really realise he was gay until his early 20s, and he didn't tell his parents until shortly before the Rugby statement. \"They lived in Scotland and I was in London. We never really had the chance to have that rather difficult conversation.\" He says that they were initially concerned, \"but subsequently they have been wonderful. They always ask about Dorian when I speak to them on the phone.\"</p> <p>Smith's partner is Dorian Jabri, a consultant advising companies on ethical investment. Jabri was communications director for the teacher training agency when he first met Smith in 1988 at a lobby of MPs about section 28. Jabri then asked Smith to speak at a conference, and a few months later they were living together. There was a minor press flurry shortly after the 1997 election, when Jabri was invited to a Buckingham Palace function as Smith's partner, but mostly their social life is fairly low-key. Strikingly, considering Smith's job, they still regularly attend cultural events where they actually pay for themselves. Their most recent private evening out was to see Fiona Shaw's Medea a few weeks ago.</p> <p>Smith says: \"After the 1984 statement, I made a deliberate point of being absolutely prepared to plunge into issues that affected the lesbian and gay community; be it raids on bookshops, police entrapment or the start of section 28. But at the same time I made it clear I wasn't a one-issue politician. I also wanted to talk about the economy and housing and pensions and poverty.\"</p> <p>Richardson says that he has struck a good balance. \"He's maintained a high profile as a gay politician, been supportive of gay rights organisations, and has turned up to most of the gay rights votes that his schedule will permit. When you hear MPs say they won't be a one-issue politician, you worry they are not going to be a gay MP at all. But he has shown that you can be true to your principles and still be an extremely effective politician. He's not diminished by it; in fact, I think it has added to his stature.\"</p> <p>Smith became an MP at Labour's lowest point, but says he only once thought he would spend his whole career in opposition - when Labour failed to win Basildon in 1992. That confirmed John Major's unlikely victory. \"I knew that the oppositionalist mentality of the early 80s had not served anyone well,\" says Smith. He characterises himself as soft left at the time, and didn't vote for Tony Benn in the divisive deputy leadership contest of 1981. He says the incident that finally persuaded him Labour had to change was at his constituency re-selection meeting in 1985. A caucus of Militant supporters disrupted the meeting by demanding that Smith oppose the party inquiry into the Militant-dominated Liverpool local party. He took them on in a 20-minute public slanging match. \"I got a lot of support from ordinary members and we didn't see [the Militants] again.\"</p> <p>Smith says he was proud to then be part of the changes to the party begun by Neil Kinnock, and he still has a high regard for him as, \"the person more than any other who saved the Labour party\", and particularly for the dignified way he has conducted himself since resigning in 1992. But the leader he was closest to was John Smith, and on his desk is a picture he took of Smith on a Scottish mountainside five weeks before he died. \"I still can't fully get over the sense of loss,\" he says. \"It is very hard in both personal and political terms. What he had achieved was to put across to the electorate that passionate belief in social justice with a sense of economic competence. He had convinced people that it was both possible and necessary for the two to sit together in any sensible government, and it took root in people's minds as to what the Labour party stood for.\"</p> <p>After John Smith's sudden death, he quickly decided to support Blair, who he not only saw as someone who could win for Labour but as someone who had a radical streak. Chris Smith also supported the whole New Labour project, although he stresses that, \"the one thing I was very keen to ensure we didn't do was to lose the absolutely fundamental belief in social justice\". Much was read into his invitation to Cherie Blair's 40th birthday party, in terms of him officially joining the Blairite coterie.</p> <p>As an opposition frontbencher in the 90s, it was said that while he was competent, the Tories never thought he posed a real threat. However, Stephen Dorrell, whom he twice shadowed at heritage and health, describes Smith as, \"always perfectly honourable. If he wasn't willing to do something, he said so, and if he was willing to do something, then he did it.\"</p> <p>Perhaps part of the reason for any ineffectualness in opposition was that he was so frequently moved between briefs. At social security, he was the first of a string of people Blair asked to \"think the unthinkable\" in restructuring the government's vast expenditure. Mutterings from Gordon Brown's camp imply that all he did was work out schemes that would have cost billions, and Smith was moved on. He now acknowledges that he did have a policy disagreement with Brown on child benefit. Smith felt that withdrawing it from children over 16 might be a disincentive to education, but says now that he is completely in agreement with the amended policy that emerged in government, and that he and Brown work well together.</p> <p>\"It is a remarkably cohesive cabinet,\" he says. \"There are very few disagreements on policy matters, and we all get on pretty well on a personal level.\" He is closest, politically and socially, to Mo Mowlam, who describes him as, \"a decent human being who works incredibly hard and believes in what we are trying to do. He wants to help people, and is a principled guy who will find a way to achieve what he wants.\"</p> <p>In particular, he has found a way round the major political anomaly of his post. Previous culture ministers have been hamstrung by the arm's-length principle of funding, by which the minister gets the cash out of the treasury but other organisations, such as the arts council, decide what it is spent on. Such has been Smith's influence on policy-making that, although the independence of funding has been maintained, he is very much seen by the big hitters in the arts world as the man who can get things done.</p> <p>The philanthropic publisher and financier, Christopher Ondaatje, is impressed. Having worked with Smith after he donated \u00a32.75m towards the new wing of the National Portrait Gallery, Ondaatje recently gave \u00a32m to the Labour Party. He particularly praises the model of national institutions, the private sector and government working together. \"Something seems to have happened in the arts in this country that is right. It hasn't happened over night, but Chris Smith has lent his support and enthusiasm to a number of institutions that seem to have lead a cultural revolution in England. I am really very proud to have been able to work with him and to have done something worthwhile.\"</p> <p>Smith operates on the politician's seemingly obligatory four or five hours' sleep a night, filling his days with meetings and his evenings with functions. He worries about the lack of time to refresh and re-think his politics. \"It's one of the problems of being in government; not seeing the wood for the trees. You are constantly dealing with individual issues and problems, and you try to run the tactics and you forget the strategy. You have to make time to sit back and look at the big themes you are trying to put in place.\"</p> <p>Julia Neuberger says she thinks there is still a really big book in him. \"I thought he would write the big Wordsworth book, but I am not sure what it will be now. But after he retires I am sure he will write something important, maybe on cultural policy.\"</p> <p>The notion of Smith having more time to spend with his Wordsworth and his walking has been a regular feature of political gossip, and more recently there have been rumours that his whole department is to be scrapped. But he insists the department's future is secure. \"I've been told by the very highest authority that it is not going to happen,\" he states meaningfully, adding that while, of course, it is the PM's decision, he also hopes to have plenty more wear out of both his red box and his dinner jacket.</p> <p>\"We need to follow through. There are the creative partnerships between cultural organisations and schools. It will allow children to get the chance to work with arts professionals. Far too few children have these opportunities, which could be of major benefit to them. Then there's Culture on Line, by which people can interact with the best of cultural activity and resources. This will be the equivalent of the Open University in the 60s, or Channel 4 in the 80s. More trust in the excellent institutions, with longer grants and less interference, and a whole new agenda for school sport. There' s certainly more work to be done.\"</p> <p><br><b>Life at a glance</b><br></p> <p><b> Christopher Robert Smith </b></p> <p><b>Born: </b> 24 July 1951</p> <p><b> Education: </b> Cassiobury Primary School, Watford; George Watson's College, Edinburgh; Pembroke College, Cambridge 69-75, Harvard University 75-76</p> <p><b> Family: </b> partner Dorian Jabri</p> <p><b> Career:</b> Development Secretary, Shaftesbury Housing Association 77-80; Development Co-ordinator Society for Co-operative Dwellings 80-83.</p> <p><b> Political career:</b> Islington councillor, 78-83; MP Islington South and Finsbury, since 83</p> <p><b> Posts held:</b> Opposition spokesman on treasury and economic affairs 87-92, on environmental protection 92-94, on national heritage 94-95, on social security 95-96, on health 96-97; secretary of state for culture, media and sport since 97</p> <p><b> Other posts:</b> Executive of NCCL 86-88; executive committee of National Trust 95-97; Governor Sadler's Wells Theatre 87-97</p> <p><b> Books:</b> Creative Britain 98</p>",

It was a Christian household, and Smith has been an active member of the Church of Scotland since his teenage years. There were also politics, although his parent's brand wasn't to the young Chris's taste. \"I have to admit that they are both staunch Liberal Democrats,\" he winces. In Edinburgh he attended George Watson's College, which was then a direct grant school and is now independent. Smith supported Labour at elections in the 60s and his friend, Douglas Graham, now a solicitor in Inverness, says Smith's interest in party politics didn't mark him out at all. \"But he wasn't a dominant or a loud character. He was obviously highly intelligent and very determined, but he was always slightly reserved.\" Smith says that, while there was a lot of reading at home, it was through school that he was really exposed to the arts. \"A teacher helped out at the Edinburgh Festival, so we got tickets to concerts and other events. I remember seeing Ian McKellen in both Richard II and Edward II sometime in the late 60s. It bowled me over.\" He did play the piano - \"I got to grade six\" - but his main leisure activity was walking and hill climbing. He introduced the late John Smith to the sport, and he is the only MP who has climbed all the Munros, the 277 Scottish hills over 3,000ft. He started climbing on a school trip when he was 12, and has been hooked ever since. \"It is not only great exercise and a challenge. There is no better antidote to being in the smoke-filled corridors than to be standing on a mountain with half the country laid out before you. It really does put everything else into perspective.\" It is not only because of departmental responsibilities that he has been given the job of speaking up for the tourist industry in the face of the foot and mouth epidemic. Few other members of the cabinet have anything like his empathy for rural Britain. Douglas Graham was present when he completed the last Munro, and says it is a tribute to Smith that friends came from all over Britain to be with him for the occasion. \"It was a typically drizzly sort of day, but we had some champagne and a dram at the top and there was a lot of sincere friendship in evidence. There were people from school and university and politics. It was obvious that high office hadn't changed him as a man.\" Smith's passion for politics and climbing were forged at the same time. He says that, growing up in the 60s, he was aware it was, \"an incredible time of hope and belief that you could change the world\". He had been impressed by the optimism surrounding Harold Wilson coming into office in 1964, and in America by the Kennedy and then Johnson administrations, the civil rights protests and anti-Vietnam war movements. \"And there was my Christian faith. I don't think anyone can sit down and read the Sermon on the Mount without ending up a socialist. All that bundle of emotions about hope and change and democracy led me into the Labour party, and to a considerable extent has sustained me in the Labour party ever since.\" The issues that still most animate him are those of basic equality of opportunity. He proudly praises his former university supervisor, who forged new links between Scottish comprehensives and Oxford colleges, and so enabled their brightest pupils to get to Oxford for the first time. In his current job, he has been a fervent supporter of increased access to cultural institutions. \"The aim of ensuring that the maximum amount of people have access to the best things in life has been at the heart of everything we have tried to do,\" he says. \"It is the lodestone upon which everything else is based. I become very angry at some people who have argued that there are too many people coming into our museums. They regret that what they call the stillness of the old museums has gone. That is an exclusive argument about keeping the best things for the privileged few. It is perfectly possible for someone to have a high-art experience, even if they don't have a high-art background.\" Jude Kelly, artistic director of the Yorkshire playhouse, sees an essentially democratic strand running throughout his policies. \"He knows that if you are really looking for democracy, then that should apply to health and education, and also to culture. Until regions are served with first-class work, then you don't have a democracy, and he is genuinely committed to this.\" As a student reading English at Cambridge in the late 60s, Smith was elected president of the union and chairman of the Fabian society. He took part in his share of demos, but recalls that much of the protest at Cambridge was remarkably genteel. \"There was once a sit-in which lasted three or four days and was enormous fun. But when the vanguard of the invading students first entered the building, they actually stopped and held up the students behind them while they rolled up the William Morris carpet so it wouldn't get damaged.\" A contemporary was Rabbi Julia Neuberger, who remembers him as, \"very clever, even among a lot of very clever people. You could talk to Chris about things you wouldn't talk to other people about. We really would have conversations about Wordsworth.\" She echoes the view that he is largely unchanged. \"I still sometimes want to play the Jewish mother with him and tell him to get more sleep,\" she laughs, \"which is exactly the same as it was when we first met.\" Smith says that at Cambridge, he asked himself if he wanted a life in politics. The answer was, \"yes, probably\", but he felt he had to do other things first. After gaining a double first, he embarked on a PhD about ideas of solitude in 18th-century poetry, with particular emphasis on Wordsworth and Coleridge. He then spent a year at Harvard as a Kennedy scholar. \"I was mainly working on my thesis, but I also hugely enjoyed the experience of being in America. I admired the American way of seeing how something could be done rather than ways that it couldn't. I was there in 75/76, which was post-Watergate and coming up to the bicentennial and presidential elections.\" He worked on Arizona democrat Mo Udall's failed presidential campaign and, on returning to Britain, thought about joining the civil service. \"But I had the perspicacity to know that I would not want to spend my life serving a Tory government. So I worked in housing instead.\" He was taken on as a graduate trainee by the government quango, the Housing Corporation. Nine months later he left to work for the Shaftesbury housing association, a Christian-based organisation that provides sheltered homes for the elderly and disabled. Smith says that even now, when he passes a building he was partly responsible for, he has a small surge of pride. Mick Sweeney, now director of a housing association, was a colleague of Smith and a fellow branch official of their union. \"He didn't put himself about like the stereotype of a politician on the make,\" recalls Sweeney. \"He took his work very seriously, and he believed in providing low-cost housing to people. I think it's quite refreshing that someone like Chris has got the position that he has.\" So unassuming was Smith that when, some years later, another housing colleague attended a conference at which the Labour social security spokesman was speaking, he was amazed that, \"it was that Chris Smith who came on stage. It just never occurred to me that it could be the same person.\" In fact, Smith had begun climbing the political greasy pole when he was elected as an Islington councillor in 1978. The following year he stood in the general election in the unwinnable Tory seat of Epsom and Ewell, and afterwards jokingly confided that his biggest concern while canvassing was to avoid falling in the suburban swimming pools. At Islington he became Labour whip and chair of the housing committee. It was an extremely difficult time, with a split Labour group, over half of whom eventually defected to the SDP. Acrimonious meetings would often carry on through the night as the differing factions cajoled reluctant councillors to vote their way, and it is a measure of Smith's toughness that he survived politically, let alone prospered. His cabinet colleague, Mo Mowlam, says he's always been strong but, \"he's tough in a way that doesn't seem tough. Remember that he got through the dome as the minister responsible. He's not a table-thumping toughie, but he doesn't give in.\" Islington council during this period was the spiritual home of what the tabloids liked to call the loony left. The red flag literally flew over the town hall and the widespread perception that councils such as Islington were more interested in political posturing than providing services reflected badly on Labour nationally. How does he look back on those years? \"Well, I'm proud of many of the actual achievements, such as estate renovation programmes, rehabilitation of street houses, and some children's services,\" he says. \"But I'm not proud of the murky politics. There was a lot of unpleasantness, a lot of sheer difficulty in getting decisions made.\" He says that, as a chair of housing and a housing professional, he became ever more conscious that it was decisions taken by central government that dictated what he was able to do. \"While I had taken socialism on board intellectually, it was while I was a councillor in Islington that I saw people living in poor housing and in poverty and became convinced that government exists to work for people like these. I really wanted to get closer to where the decision-making was in order to make a difference.\" His chance came at the 1983 general election, when he was selected to stand against the sitting Islington MP, George Cunningham, who had defected from Labour to the SDP. It was such a close contest that on his way to the count, Smith's agent advised him to prepare two speeches. After a recount, he eventually won by 363 votes. It was 18 months later that he came out as gay, but contingency plans were in place for the election. \"It was a reasonably well known fact that I was gay, as I'd made no particular secret of it. If it had emerged during the campaign, I would have said yes.\" As an MP he wanted to say something publicly as a way of putting the issue to rest. When, in November 1984, the Conservative-controlled council in Rugby dropped a policy banning discrimination on the grounds of sexuality, Smith was asked to address a protest meeting. A few minutes before he spoke, he decided that this was the moment. His opening line was: \"My name is Chris Smith. I'm the Labour MP for Islington South and Finsbury, and I'm gay.\" While his statement was reported in the press, it didn't spark a tabloid frenzy, and it was four months before the Sun even mentioned it. However, in the next general election campaign in 1987, Smith canvassers had a script as to what to say if anyone raised it. \"The first point,\" he says, \"was, 'isn't it a refreshing change to have a politician who is honest'. The second line was, 'he's a good MP who works hard for everyone'. And the third one, if people really persisted, was, 'you're not telling me you're prejudiced, are you?' No canvasser ever had to get to line number three, and I won with an increased majority.\" Colin Richardson, the editor of Gay Times, says Smith's coming out was obviously important. \"But even more important was when he was re-elected. There was a fear that even though he had what should have been a safe seat, it would rebound. But it was the opposite.\" Smith has said he didn't really realise he was gay until his early 20s, and he didn't tell his parents until shortly before the Rugby statement. \"They lived in Scotland and I was in London. We never really had the chance to have that rather difficult conversation.\" He says that they were initially concerned, \"but subsequently they have been wonderful. They always ask about Dorian when I speak to them on the phone.\" Smith's partner is Dorian Jabri, a consultant advising companies on ethical investment. Jabri was communications director for the teacher training agency when he first met Smith in 1988 at a lobby of MPs about section 28. Jabri then asked Smith to speak at a conference, and a few months later they were living together. There was a minor press flurry shortly after the 1997 election, when Jabri was invited to a Buckingham Palace function as Smith's partner, but mostly their social life is fairly low-key. Strikingly, considering Smith's job, they still regularly attend cultural events where they actually pay for themselves. Their most recent private evening out was to see Fiona Shaw's Medea a few weeks ago. Smith says: \"After the 1984 statement, I made a deliberate point of being absolutely prepared to plunge into issues that affected the lesbian and gay community; be it raids on bookshops, police entrapment or the start of section 28. But at the same time I made it clear I wasn't a one-issue politician. I also wanted to talk about the economy and housing and pensions and poverty.\" Richardson says that he has struck a good balance. \"He's maintained a high profile as a gay politician, been supportive of gay rights organisations, and has turned up to most of the gay rights votes that his schedule will permit. When you hear MPs say they won't be a one-issue politician, you worry they are not going to be a gay MP at all. But he has shown that you can be true to your principles and still be an extremely effective politician. He's not diminished by it; in fact, I think it has added to his stature.\" Smith became an MP at Labour's lowest point, but says he only once thought he would spend his whole career in opposition - when Labour failed to win Basildon in 1992. That confirmed John Major's unlikely victory. \"I knew that the oppositionalist mentality of the early 80s had not served anyone well,\" says Smith. He characterises himself as soft left at the time, and didn't vote for Tony Benn in the divisive deputy leadership contest of 1981. He says the incident that finally persuaded him Labour had to change was at his constituency re-selection meeting in 1985. A caucus of Militant supporters disrupted the meeting by demanding that Smith oppose the party inquiry into the Militant-dominated Liverpool local party. He took them on in a 20-minute public slanging match. \"I got a lot of support from ordinary members and we didn't see [the Militants] again.\" Smith says he was proud to then be part of the changes to the party begun by Neil Kinnock, and he still has a high regard for him as, \"the person more than any other who saved the Labour party\", and particularly for the dignified way he has conducted himself since resigning in 1992. But the leader he was closest to was John Smith, and on his desk is a picture he took of Smith on a Scottish mountainside five weeks before he died. \"I still can't fully get over the sense of loss,\" he says. \"It is very hard in both personal and political terms. What he had achieved was to put across to the electorate that passionate belief in social justice with a sense of economic competence. He had convinced people that it was both possible and necessary for the two to sit together in any sensible government, and it took root in people's minds as to what the Labour party stood for.\" After John Smith's sudden death, he quickly decided to support Blair, who he not only saw as someone who could win for Labour but as someone who had a radical streak. Chris Smith also supported the whole New Labour project, although he stresses that, \"the one thing I was very keen to ensure we didn't do was to lose the absolutely fundamental belief in social justice\". Much was read into his invitation to Cherie Blair's 40th birthday party, in terms of him officially joining the Blairite coterie. As an opposition frontbencher in the 90s, it was said that while he was competent, the Tories never thought he posed a real threat. However, Stephen Dorrell, whom he twice shadowed at heritage and health, describes Smith as, \"always perfectly honourable. If he wasn't willing to do something, he said so, and if he was willing to do something, then he did it.\" Perhaps part of the reason for any ineffectualness in opposition was that he was so frequently moved between briefs. At social security, he was the first of a string of people Blair asked to \"think the unthinkable\" in restructuring the government's vast expenditure. Mutterings from Gordon Brown's camp imply that all he did was work out schemes that would have cost billions, and Smith was moved on. He now acknowledges that he did have a policy disagreement with Brown on child benefit. Smith felt that withdrawing it from children over 16 might be a disincentive to education, but says now that he is completely in agreement with the amended policy that emerged in government, and that he and Brown work well together. \"It is a remarkably cohesive cabinet,\" he says. \"There are very few disagreements on policy matters, and we all get on pretty well on a personal level.\" He is closest, politically and socially, to Mo Mowlam, who describes him as, \"a decent human being who works incredibly hard and believes in what we are trying to do. He wants to help people, and is a principled guy who will find a way to achieve what he wants.\" In particular, he has found a way round the major political anomaly of his post. Previous culture ministers have been hamstrung by the arm's-length principle of funding, by which the minister gets the cash out of the treasury but other organisations, such as the arts council, decide what it is spent on. Such has been Smith's influence on policy-making that, although the independence of funding has been maintained, he is very much seen by the big hitters in the arts world as the man who can get things done. The philanthropic publisher and financier, Christopher Ondaatje, is impressed. Having worked with Smith after he donated \u00a32.75m towards the new wing of the National Portrait Gallery, Ondaatje recently gave \u00a32m to the Labour Party. He particularly praises the model of national institutions, the private sector and government working together. \"Something seems to have happened in the arts in this country that is right. It hasn't happened over night, but Chris Smith has lent his support and enthusiasm to a number of institutions that seem to have lead a cultural revolution in England. I am really very proud to have been able to work with him and to have done something worthwhile.\" Smith operates on the politician's seemingly obligatory four or five hours' sleep a night, filling his days with meetings and his evenings with functions. He worries about the lack of time to refresh and re-think his politics. \"It's one of the problems of being in government; not seeing the wood for the trees. You are constantly dealing with individual issues and problems, and you try to run the tactics and you forget the strategy. You have to make time to sit back and look at the big themes you are trying to put in place.\" Julia Neuberger says she thinks there is still a really big book in him. \"I thought he would write the big Wordsworth book, but I am not sure what it will be now. But after he retires I am sure he will write something important, maybe on cultural policy.\" The notion of Smith having more time to spend with his Wordsworth and his walking has been a regular feature of political gossip, and more recently there have been rumours that his whole department is to be scrapped. But he insists the department's future is secure. \"I've been told by the very highest authority that it is not going to happen,\" he states meaningfully, adding that while, of course, it is the PM's decision, he also hopes to have plenty more wear out of both his red box and his dinner jacket. \"We need to follow through. There are the creative partnerships between cultural organisations and schools. It will allow children to get the chance to work with arts professionals. Far too few children have these opportunities, which could be of major benefit to them. Then there's Culture on Line, by which people can interact with the best of cultural activity and resources. This will be the equivalent of the Open University in the 60s, or Channel 4 in the 80s. More trust in the excellent institutions, with longer grants and less interference, and a whole new agenda for school sport. There' s certainly more work to be done.\" Life at a glance Christopher Robert Smith Born: 24 July 1951 Education: Cassiobury Primary School, Watford; George Watson's College, Edinburgh; Pembroke College, Cambridge 69-75, Harvard University 75-76 Family: partner Dorian Jabri Career: Development Secretary, Shaftesbury Housing Association 77-80; Development Co-ordinator Society for Co-operative Dwellings 80-83.

      "bodyText": "Aspiring managers with technical and engineering skills looking for a final pit stop before hitting the fast track to boardroom success have a champion in Imperial College Management School (ICMS). The college owes its foundation to Prince Albert who backed the idea that some of the financial surplus generated from the Great Exhibition of 1851 be used to build the Kensington campus of which Imperial is a part. The college, which received its Royal Charter in 1907, has a mission to \"advance knowledge for the benefit of industry and commerce\". With change and uncertainty forcing their way on to the business agenda, the Imperial MBA focuses on improving managerial ability to handle the current rapid pace of corporate upheaval. The management school maintains close links with many businesses in different sectors, seeking their advice in the development of its syllabus design and teaching. Not only was the school praised as excellent by the government's Teaching Assessment Audit Committee, but was also described as outstanding within this top category. But it's the school's Entrepreneurship Centre that has recently become the talk of business education providers.

The council's refusal to reopen its Chiltern walks means that the prime minister and his family will be marooned at Chequers over the holiday.</p> <p>\"We consider it a prudent course to take. We have had two areas affected by cases in [adjoining] Northamptonshire and Oxfordshire and four suspect cases here. They all got the all-clear, but we want to keep it that way,\" explained a defiantly off-message Terry Carter, Buckinghamshire's principal trading standards officer.</p> <p>As Mr Blair beat the tourist drum in Yorkshire, trailed by TV crews from France, Japan and the US, John Prescott loyally went sailing on the foot and mouth-free Norfolk Broads yesterday. Senior colleagues rallied to the call to stay at home, cancelling all thoughts of a quick trip to the ski slopes or the Canaries during the gap created by the non-election.</p> <p>Apart from Robin Cook, whose job as foreign secretary unavoidably takes him abroad, only the Northern Ireland secretary, John Reid, admitted to having even thought about a foreign outing over Easter.- but no longer. \"He has cancelled a holiday in France,\" aides confirmed. \"He will be boosting tourism in the province instead.\"</p> <p>Paul Murphy, his Welsh counterpart, will be spending Easter in Dorset. While he is away, chief whip Ann Taylor and her family will be in Wales.</p> <p>Most of the cabinet's Scots will be at home for the holiday. the lord chancellor, Lord Irvine, will be in his Highland pile, the chancellor, Gordon Brown, at his North Queensferry home high above the Forth bridges when not working at the Treasury, and Alistair Darling with his family in Edinburgh.</p> <p>Mr Blair had always intended to spend a few days at Chequers. It is set in genuine farmland, with grazing sheep and cattle sometimes in view from its mullioned windows, along with the armed police officers and Blair family football goalposts. Unfortunately for No 10, Buckinghamshire is full of mixed arable and grazing land.</p> <p>In practice, the persistent footpath ban will affect cabinet members differently. Margaret Jay, leader of the Lords, has a country cottage in Ireland, but another in the Cotswolds, as does Michael Meacher, the many-homed environment minister.</p> <p>Both are likely to find Gloucestershire's off-road paths still closed unless the government's appeal starts to make headway. Jack Straw, whose rural retreat is in Oxfordshire, will have to do his Easter walking on tarmac too. Chris Smith, the culture secretary, is going to Suffolk - foot and mouth-free so far - as is Geoff Hoon, whose troops are busy burying the disease's victims.</p> <p>David Blunkett couldn't visit the Peak District from his Sheffield home even if he wanted to - it got its first suspected case yesterday. But the lucky education secretary and his deputy, Estelle Morris, will be touring teachers' conferences in Cardiff and Jersey.</p> <p>Mr Blair himself will do one such union conference, the AUT in Torquay, the most urban part of hard-hit Devon. William Hague will snatch a few days electioneering from a base at his Richmond, North Yorkshire, constituency home. <b>Email update</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/email\">Sign up for our free daily foot and mouth round-up</a><br><br><b>More on the election and foot and mouth</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/footandmouth\">Politics: foot and mouth</a></p> <p><b>What's going on?</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/list\">Full list: outbreaks </a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/graphic/0,7367,464555,00.html\">Graph: rise in cases</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,460510,00.html\">Full list: closed &amp; cancelled</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446486,00.html\">Causes and effects</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/theissues/article/0,6512,441031,00.html\">The issue explained</a><br><br><b>The front line: meet those affected by the crisis</b><br> <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,467836,00.html\">03.04.2001: Straws in the wind</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,446966,00.html  \">06.03.2001: Meet our panel</a><br><br><b>Related articles</b> <br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,469559,00.html\">06.04.2001: \u00a3120m boost for tourism</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,469518,00.html\">06.04.2001, comment: Pig in the middle</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,469265,00.html\">06.04.2001: Burial mound suggested to cut west's surplus of carcasses</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,469284,00.html\">06.04.2001: Man shot in head with bolt gun dies</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/footandmouth/story/0,7369,469370,00.html\">06.04.2001, analysis: No reason to be cheerful -

Someone borrowing \u00a360,000 in 1990 from the Halifax on an interest-only mortgage paid \u00a3634 per month, even after a \u00a395 subsidy from the taxpayer in the form of the now-abolished Miras.

The headlines will then read \"lowest mortgages since 1960\". </p> <p>But amid the hype, it is becoming increasingly difficult to get to grips with what homeowners really are paying on their mortgages. The lowest variable rates are now offered by Nationwide, HSBC (6.25%) and Intelligent Finance (6.25%), which have opened up a considerable gap ahead of most of the building societies which converted to banks, such as Northern Rock and Alliance &amp; Leicester, whose variable rates are 7.25%. </p> <p>Up to a third of Britain's 11m mortgage holders are on fixed rates, and will therefore see no change as a result of this week's rate cut. More recently buyers have largely opted for discount loans, which will benefit. Many are on two-year, 2% off deals, which is bringing some rates down to less than 5%. At that level, a \u00a3100,000 mortgage costs little more than \u00a3400 per month to service. </p> <p>Nationwide reopened its war of words with Halifax, accusing the lender of passing the benefits of its new 6.5% rate to only a small number of customers. </p> <p>Halifax, Nationwide and Abbey National all split their variable rates into SVR1 and SVR2 last month, with borrowers in discount and capped deals tied to the old SVR1, with the rest transferred to, or invited to transfer to, a new, lower SVR2. </p> <p>Nationwide said this week that 530,000 of its 890,000 borrowers will enjoy its new 6.24% base rate, with the balance locked into fixed or discount deals. \"We don't believe that Halifax has more than 150,000 of its 2.5m borrowers on their new rate,\" claimed a Nationwide spokesman. </p> <p>Halifax admitted that only 100,000 borrowers have so far switched to its new base rate, but said that 400,000 will move over the next few months. </p> <p>A spokesman said: \"Unlike Nationwide we do not have anyone in extended lock-in periods and the remainder of our borrowers are on special deals, the majority of which are on lower rates than 6.5%. </p> <p>\"Halifax is focused on providing customers with a good deal. Nationwide, on the other hand, seem to be anxious to win their election.\" </p> <p>However, both Halifax or Nationwide continue to refuse to switch customers who took out discount deals before March to switch to the new standard variable rates without paying hefty penalties, as highlighted in Jobs &amp; Money. </p> <p>Mortgage holders claim the move is in breach of contract, and have taken their cases to the Office of Fair Trading and the Banking Ombudsman, which are yet to rule on the matter. The figures in the table below show the difference between old and new standard variable rate payments at the two lenders. So what is the best mortgage for home buyers now, and what sort of rate should you expect to pay? Ray Boulger of Charcol says: \"Some people may be holding out in the hope that fixed/capped rates fall further, but our advice is not to wait as there are already good products out there offering low rates which already factor in further base rate cuts which may or may not materialise. </p> <p>\"Furthermore, some of these rates are loss leaders, but as lenders will progressively have less fat to cream off their existing borrowers as new-style standard variable rates are reduced to around 0.75%-1% over base rate, I expect new offers to become less competitive in the main.\" </p> <p>Mr Boulger is currently recommending that borrowers opt for mortgages which are a mix of fixed rate plus a tracker rate which moves in line with base rate. </p> <p>Charcol has a remortgage product which is fixed at 4.7% until 2003, then switches to 0.6% over base rate until 2004. Birmingham Midshires has a five-year fix at 5.79% until 2006, which gives the option to switch at any time to base rate plus 1% for the remaining mortgage term. Charcol believes the best pure fixed rate is Bristol &amp; West's three-year loan pegged at 5.15% to 2004.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Emanuel Ungaro is a very serious man - devoted to fashion, of course, but more likely to talk about Freud than the cut of a frock. Indeed, there is a portrait of the psychoanalyst on his desk, and on a poster on the wall, in big letters, is Freud's eternal poser: \"The great question . . . which I have not been able to answer, despite my 30 years of research into the feminine soul, is 'What does a woman want?'\" It is a question you'd think Ungaro would be well placed to answer, given his experience of 40 odd years' experience of dressing women. \"Do you study Freud?\" asks the 68-year-old couturier, as if this was as obvious as asking which football team you support. Don't think of me as just a designer, he seems to be saying - I'm much more than that. Ungaro is one of the last in the grand tradition of couturiers. He is in charge, but has enormous respect for his staff, and hopes this confidence is reflected in the clothes. \"This house has a strong sense of ethics and vigour in the search of quality, of that I'm sure. I was born like that.\" And now he is ensuring the tradition lives on - in his house, at least. His appointment of 34-year-old Giambattista Valli as creative director has brought a new vibrancy and glamour to the Ungaro label.</p> <p>Ungaro was born in Aix-en-Provence to Italian parents - his father was a tailor. He came to Paris aged 22, determined to enter the fashion industry. \"I remember I had no money, I had nothing. I was renting a room from this old aristocratic man on a small street on the Left Bank. But I remember once, late at night, standing on the street, eating at a hotdog stall. In my head, I was building my couture house, believing that some day I would have one.\" He quickly found work with Cristobal Balenciaga, the great Spanish couturier. Balenciaga was highly regarded by his peers, an intellectual whose work was never populist like that of Chanel or Dior. For Ungaro, the training was the best imaginable. \"Balenciaga never talked. You had to learn and take from it the sense of quality. He was a very alone, very silent man. I never met her, but I heard that Chanel was a genius and a monster. Balenciaga was a genius, but not a monster. He was fantastic to be with. But then you have to go it alone, and it is very difficult to start from nothing with four workers.\"</p> <p>Ungaro's first collection, in 1965, was restricted to daywear only, because his tiny studio had no room to accommodate any space-taking dresses. He started on his own at an important time for fashion. Alongside Yves Saint Laurent, he helped to establish ready-to-wear as a viable alternative to couture. But founding a house was as difficult then as it is for young designers today. \"The moment you have no money, you have to work,\" he declares. </p> <p>\"I worked 18 hours a day, every day of the year, no vacation. I lived for years in a small studio. I had no luxury habits, and I bought my first car, a Mini Morris, when I was 40. But I didn't mind. I love to work. I was born into a very modest family, it was not a complication for me.\" Steadily, with no rush or boastful fanfare, Ungaro built a reputation for his way with colour and print, and not for going too far into the extremities of cut or trend. He has always been about flattering the women he dresses, rather than seeing them as design experiments. This makes sense, since Ungaro is that rare thing: a heterosexual fashion designer. Married, he has a 10-year-old daughter with his wife, Laura, who is also the director of communications for the house and responsible for the brand's family atmosphere.</p> <p>For more than 30 years, Ungaro remained independent from the conglomerates that now control fashion. His business was successful, but had expanded as much as it could. Unlike most of the other French labels, all of Ungaro's profits came from clothes rather than bags or shoes. This meant there was a ceiling to his house's profits. </p> <p>His career high came in the taffeta-heavy 80s: his highly decorated, ruched, starchy dresses-with-a-sense-of-occasion suited the times. The 90s were not such a good match; the house of Ungaro was never going to embrace grunge. After a period of introspection, Ungaro saw that the need to revive his house was vital. In 1996, he gave up his fiercely-held independence by entering into partnership with Italian label Salvatore Ferregamo (which is fashion-speak for Ferregamo buying a majority stake in Ungaro). The deal gave him the opportunity to reclaim his position on the global fashion scene. \"Try to stay alone? Impossible,\" he says. \"I could have stayed alone, of course, but with limited ambitions, and the day I'm not here, what happens with the house?\" </p> <p>Clearly, concern over the future of Ungaro house weighs heavily upon him. \"Some day, I have to leave all of this and let people do what they want to do, because I can't be responsible when I'm in the coffin,\" he declares abruptly. \"But it is not sad, what I'm saying. It's like family, when a father is trying to leave them the best in the world.\" And, just as he had to find a suitably understanding financial partner to ensure he kept full creative control, so he needed to employ the right sort of new talent for the house. After all, in the past few years many of the Paris houses have been hotbeds of rumours about new, mismatched designers causing uproar in the ateliers. </p> <p>That was never going to be the case in Ungaro's atelier in avenue Montaigne. Ungaro found Valli at Krizia in Italy. Laura asked him to do some sketches, demonstrating how he would fit into the style of the house. Valli handed in the work, then went on holiday to India. \"They called me there and said that Mr Ungaro wanted to see me right away,\" Valli remembers. The pair got on straight away: \"You know, in most of the houses, they bring in somebody new who doesn't think about what is the real story,\" says Valli. \"They build up their own, but it doesn't fit with the style of the house. But with Mr Ungaro there is never a case of me or you. I always propose what I think is right for Ungaro. I never propose the trend of the moment.\"</p> <p>Five years on from the Ferregamo deal, expansion is well underway. This month, the UK's first Emanuel Ungaro boutique opens on a prime piece of Bond Street real estate. The huge store is a statement of new confidence, instilled by Ungaro's new creative director. The Ungaro look is still recognisably there, but Valli has brought a lighter touch - the fluid, embellished clothes look at their most fresh when thrown together with some denim and a pair of high heels. The move has paid off, with sales rocketing and the clothes being worn by such celebrities as Jennifer Lopez, Britney Spears and Sarah Jessica Parker.</p> <p>\"People used to be afraid of him,\" says Valli. While Ungaro is immaculately presentable in his atelier uniform, Valli looks like he hasn't been to bed, and his cords are so dirty and torn around his ankles it's as if he's just spent a weekend at Glastonbury. \"When I arrived,\" he says, \"they were giving the impression that [Ungaro] was inaccessible. Everyone was struck because I was wearing sneakers, and everyone was saying, 'Definitely no gum, no sneakers'. But we met, and he was really waiting for someone to talk to him. Everyone had been putting wool around him, which meant people were afraid to bring in new things. I have opened the windows of the house on what's going on outside, and now he says how he loves having all these young people around him.\"</p> <p>But for all these new ideas, there is still a rigid order to the house. Valli is interviewed separately, because it would be wrong for him to talk to the press in Ungaro's presence. It is also specified that, however great Valli's influence has been, Ungaro is still very much the designer. This is no ordinary case of a venerable house finding new blood, as has happened at the likes of Dior and Givenchy. Ungaro, one of the true couturiers, who started out with Balenciaga, is training Valli to be the last designer to come from that tradition of learning under the eye of the greats.</p> <p>There is a sense of relief at Ungaro that the arrangement is working so well, since no other house has managed to maintain the tradition. \"He has this chance to be one of the last in couture,\" declares Ungaro. \"He has this chance to have a master. If you look what's happening at the other houses, no one is doing that. Givenchy left with no one taking his place [Hubert de Givenchy never approved of Alexander McQueen, and has remained silent about his replacement, Julien Macdonald]. Coco Chanel, no one was there, Monsieur Dior did - he trained Saint Laurent, but now look what's happening at YSL with Tom Ford . . .\"</p> <p>For Valli, the wealth of accumulated knowledge is astounding: \"It was such a great occasion for me to find so pure a couturier, somebody who grew up with Balenciaga. Through him, I learn from Balenciaga - that's stunning.\"</p> <p>Now, on the studio floor of the house, there is an easy balance between Ungaro's studio - pristine, neat and expansive - and the room that houses Valli and the others on the design team - cramped, teeming with sequin trays and mood boards, exploding with ideas. \"I try to give the most of the proposition of fabrics, colours, prints,\" says Valli, \"and then we start to work together on the idea of the story, and then it goes right away.\" </p> <p>For his part, Ungaro says, \"there's the other studio, and the door is always open. Everyone has the opportunity to come in and suggest ideas, colours, shapes, but the way I'm working is really special because I'm not sketching any more. Now I'm working directly on the model, on the house girl here, because I love the direct relation with the material and the body of the girl.\" Which, reading between the lines, suggests that Ungaro is happy that there is now someone to bring a contemporary edge that allows the house to move forward by instinct rather than guesswork. At the recent autumn/winter 2001 show in Paris, the new mood was palpable. While some shows by other similarly established houses were poorly attended, the Ungaro presentation of pretty, intricate, yet wearable clothes was a hot ticket. When Ungaro came to take a bow at the end, for the first time he brought out Valli to share the applause.</p> <p>Obviously, there are occasional disagreements between the two - \"It can be very serious, very tense,\" admits Valli - but there is an overriding harmony between the two studios, even if the larger room works to the sounds of Mozart, while the smaller one is partying to Debbie Harry in a world of popular culture that Ungaro himself does not understand, but that he acknowledges as vitally important. </p> <p>\"There are all these new girls dressing in Ungaro,\" says Valli, \"like Sarah Jessica Parker or Jennifer Lopez. He sees these people from my generation, and he's looking on as a spectator. Britney Spears came into the office and we introduced her to Monsieur Ungaro, and it was so funny because sometimes he doesn't know about these things. He said to me, 'Who is Britney Spears?' I said, 'Ask your daughter'.\"</p> <p>Does Ungaro think that Valli knows how lucky he is to be working in such a harmonious house? \"I hope he does,\" he replies. \"It's often not easy. I remember at Balenciaga, everyone was jealous of me. I was very young, very ambitious, and surrounded by very mean, very terrible people. But I don't just respect the people working for me, I love them, because I know they do their best, even when they make mistakes, because nobody's perfect. And that makes the strength of the house.\"</p> <p>But the house's recent success doesn't mean the pressures on Ungaro are any less great. Somehow, it seems to make them worse. \"I've no frivolity about it, you understand,\" he says. \"It's more responsibility, in fact. Not that it's not my money, so I don't care; on the contrary, I care more than if it were mine. Before, I felt bad because I needed money to develop the house. Now the money's here, I've got to take care of it.\"</p> <p>Of course, with Freud sat there next to him, this can sound arch, as he readily admits: \"We are not surgeons, we are not trying to find the cure for cancer, we're trying to make fashion\"</p>",

The pair got on straight away: \"You know, in most of the houses, they bring in somebody new who doesn't think about what is the real story,\" says Valli. \"They build up their own, but it doesn't fit with the style of the house. But with Mr Ungaro there is never a case of me or you. I always propose what I think is right for Ungaro. I never propose the trend of the moment.\" Five years on from the Ferregamo deal, expansion is well underway. This month, the UK's first Emanuel Ungaro boutique opens on a prime piece of Bond Street real estate. The huge store is a statement of new confidence, instilled by Ungaro's new creative director. The Ungaro look is still recognisably there, but Valli has brought a lighter touch - the fluid, embellished clothes look at their most fresh when thrown together with some denim and a pair of high heels. The move has paid off, with sales rocketing and the clothes being worn by such celebrities as Jennifer Lopez, Britney Spears and Sarah Jessica Parker. \"People used to be afraid of him,\" says Valli. While Ungaro is immaculately presentable in his atelier uniform, Valli looks like he hasn't been to bed, and his cords are so dirty and torn around his ankles it's as if he's just spent a weekend at Glastonbury. \"When I arrived,\" he says, \"they were giving the impression that [Ungaro] was inaccessible. Everyone was struck because I was wearing sneakers, and everyone was saying, 'Definitely no gum, no sneakers'. But we met, and he was really waiting for someone to talk to him. Everyone had been putting wool around him, which meant people were afraid to bring in new things. I have opened the windows of the house on what's going on outside, and now he says how he loves having all these young people around him.\" But for all these new ideas, there is still a rigid order to the house. Valli is interviewed separately, because it would be wrong for him to talk to the press in Ungaro's presence. It is also specified that, however great Valli's influence has been, Ungaro is still very much the designer. This is no ordinary case of a venerable house finding new blood, as has happened at the likes of Dior and Givenchy. Ungaro, one of the true couturiers, who started out with Balenciaga, is training Valli to be the last designer to come from that tradition of learning under the eye of the greats. There is a sense of relief at Ungaro that the arrangement is working so well, since no other house has managed to maintain the tradition. \"He has this chance to be one of the last in couture,\" declares Ungaro. \"He has this chance to have a master. If you look what's happening at the other houses, no one is doing that. Givenchy left with no one taking his place [Hubert de Givenchy never approved of Alexander McQueen, and has remained silent about his replacement, Julien Macdonald]. Coco Chanel, no one was there, Monsieur Dior did - he trained Saint Laurent, but now look what's happening at YSL with Tom Ford . . .\" For Valli, the wealth of accumulated knowledge is astounding: \"It was such a great occasion for me to find so pure a couturier, somebody who grew up with Balenciaga. Through him, I learn from Balenciaga - that's stunning.\" Now, on the studio floor of the house, there is an easy balance between Ungaro's studio - pristine, neat and expansive - and the room that houses Valli and the others on the design team - cramped, teeming with sequin trays and mood boards, exploding with ideas. \"I try to give the most of the proposition of fabrics, colours, prints,\" says Valli, \"and then we start to work together on the idea of the story, and then it goes right away.\" For his part, Ungaro says, \"there's the other studio, and the door is always open. Everyone has the opportunity to come in and suggest ideas, colours, shapes, but the way I'm working is really special because I'm not sketching any more. Now I'm working directly on the model, on the house girl here, because I love the direct relation with the material and the body of the girl.\" Which, reading between the lines, suggests that Ungaro is happy that there is now someone to bring a contemporary edge that allows the house to move forward by instinct rather than guesswork. At the recent autumn/winter 2001 show in Paris, the new mood was palpable. While some shows by other similarly established houses were poorly attended, the Ungaro presentation of pretty, intricate, yet wearable clothes was a hot ticket. When Ungaro came to take a bow at the end, for the first time he brought out Valli to share the applause. Obviously, there are occasional disagreements between the two - \"It can be very serious, very tense,\" admits Valli - but there is an overriding harmony between the two studios, even if the larger room works to the sounds of Mozart, while the smaller one is partying to Debbie Harry in a world of popular culture that Ungaro himself does not understand, but that he acknowledges as vitally important. \"There are all these new girls dressing in Ungaro,\" says Valli, \"like Sarah Jessica Parker or Jennifer Lopez. He sees these people from my generation, and he's looking on as a spectator. Britney Spears came into the office and we introduced her to Monsieur Ungaro, and it was so funny because sometimes he doesn't know about these things. He said to me, 'Who is Britney Spears?' I said, 'Ask your daughter'.\" Does Ungaro think that Valli knows how lucky he is to be working in such a harmonious house? \"I hope he does,\" he replies. \"It's often not easy. I remember at Balenciaga, everyone was jealous of me. I was very young, very ambitious, and surrounded by very mean, very terrible people. But I don't just respect the people working for me, I love them, because I know they do their best, even when they make mistakes, because nobody's perfect. And that makes the strength of the house.\" But the house's recent success doesn't mean the pressures on Ungaro are any less great. Somehow, it seems to make them worse. \"I've no frivolity about it, you understand,\" he says. \"It's more responsibility, in fact. Not that it's not my money, so I don't care; on the contrary, I care more than if it were mine. Before, I felt bad because I needed money to develop the house. Now the money's here, I've got to take care of it.\" Of course, with Freud sat there next to him, this can sound arch, as he readily admits: \"We are not surgeons, we are not trying to find the cure for cancer, we're trying to make fashion\"",

      "body": "<p>'Have you no morals, man?\" says Colonel Pickering to Alfred Doolittle in Shaw's Pygmalion. \"Can't afford them, governor,\" is his succinct reply. Substitute \"ideals\" for \"morals\" and you have the dilemma facing many directors of artistic institutions struggling to survive in a long-under-funded culture. </p> <p>Looking back to the theatre of the 1960s, I am struck by how many people brought a quasi-religious zeal to their calling. Olivier, on assuming the directorship of the National Theatre, called it a \"pearl of a job\" and vowed total abstinence for a year in order to meet its demands. George Devine at the Royal Court famously said one chose one's theatre as one chose one's church and, in Olivier's words, \"liked to train his disciples' minds and send them out to bring light to the world\". Hard to imagine anyone using that kind of messianic language today. </p> <p>In fairness, passion itself is not dead. You can talk to a number of directors - Jude Kelly, say, in Leeds, Ian Rickson at the Royal Court, or Philip Hedley at Stratford East - and the light of missionary zeal comes into their eyes. But too often our big institutions, the National and the RSC, adopt the market-speak of the 1980s and talk of \"product\" and \"strategies\" rather than the burning importance of the work itself. Even the current brouhaha over Trevor Nunn's alleged earnings from My Fair Lady has been swathed in legalistic verbiage. And when I met Sir Christopher Hogg, chairman of the National Theatre board this week, he both conceded the role of the National had changed since the 1960s and defended Nunn's financial deal by saying, \"One should be so lucky to have a public-private partnership in which you enlist well below market-cost the services of someone of the class of Trevor.\" </p> <p>The words \"public-private\" are significant: this is the precise phrase that we now apply to air traffic control or the London underground. It is as if the language of politics and the market has invaded the theatre. It also raises a fundamental question: is the National, conceived as a world library of drama and a radical alternative to the commercial theatre, gradually becoming a classier version of the West End? Has it lost sight of its original visionary idealism? </p> <p>Without wishing to pick over old bones, I would simply point to two alarming precedents. The last three shows in the Lyttelton - Noises Off, Life x 3 and My Fair Lady - have all, in effect, been co-productions virtually certain of a commercial transfer; there is all the difference in the world between productions such as Copenhagen or Blue/ Orange that transfer because of their unforeseen success and productions that are conceived from the outset as exploitable hits. </p> <p>The other question concerns Nunn's own ambivalent role as both the National's artistic boss and director of some of its most temptingly commercial prospects (as well, of course, as a number of less profitable shows). In a sense, his very talent leaves him vulnerable, however unfairly, to the accusation of using the National as a commercial launchpad. His roster of productions for the next 16 months, for instance, is formidable: having overseen the Drury Lane transfer of My Fair Lady, he'll direct The Relapse, South Pacific, Oklahoma on Broadway, a Tom Stoppard trilogy and Glenn Close in A Streetcar Named Desire. All but The Relapse are seen inside the National as potentially huge earners for both the institution and the director. </p> <p>Joan Bakewell, a member of the National Theatre board, regards as \"preposterous\" the idea that Nunn's choice of work is dictated by purely commercial considerations; she points also to his enthusiasm for bringing work in from the regions and to the National's multifarious access programmes. Hogg describes the arrival of My Fair Lady and South Pacific in one year as \"a matter of chance more than anything\" and points to the fact that the assumed profits will make other things possible. All the same, the close juxtaposition of two Broadway blockbusters strikes me as a public relations disaster: they may bring in the customers but they will increase the perception that the National is turning into a musical-dominated, quasi- commercial organisation. </p> <p>Hogg's answer to all this is that the National has not lost sight of its basic principles but that it has to change with the times. \"The reality,\" he says, \"is that our grant will be 36% of our total costs in the current year, whereas in the past it has been well over 60% - it has come down steadily as the grant has been held in real terms or diminished. What has also changed is the whole political and cultural environment in which we operate. We watch that all the time and try to change the institution accordingly.\" </p> <p>In what way? \"If necessary we go into continuous runs in order to balance the books, which is our sacred, overriding rule. The balance of the repertory also constantly changes. The advent of the musical is easily the most marked difference between now and the 1960s, while there are probably fewer European classics. But our aim is to produce theatre of the highest quality, to mix mainstream classics, new plays and musicals and to be as accessible to as wide a range of people as possible.\" </p> <p>A 2,500-seat theatre complex has to exist in the real world, and I would not question all of the Nunn-Hogg priorities. But it makes me wonder if an alternative vision of the National is not possible: one closer to the original Olivier ideal. Why, for instance, is it assumed that musicals are the only way of attracting a popular audience? Isn't the need to embrace world drama just as \"sacred\" a duty as that of balancing the books? And is a Broadway transfer the ultimate theatrical goal? </p> <p>What we need is a new broom. And, while everyone is tight-lipped about Nunn's successor, my understanding is that, when his current contract expires in September 2002, he will stay on for an indeterminate period to pave the way for the new appointee. Nicholas Hytner, Howard Davies, Jude Kelly and John Caird are all in the frame - given that Sam Mendes and Stephen Daldry are busy pursuing their film careers - and the odds on Kelly are shortening daily. Whoever gets the job, however, I hope they banish marketplace rhetoric and remember that even the biggest artistic institutions survive only if personal ambition is balanced by a selfless idealism.</p>",

And when I met Sir Christopher Hogg, chairman of the National Theatre board this week, he both conceded the role of the National had changed since the 1960s and defended Nunn's financial deal by saying, \"One should be so lucky to have a public-private partnership in which you enlist well below market-cost the services of someone of the class of Trevor.\" The words \"public-private\" are significant: this is the precise phrase that we now apply to air traffic control or the London underground. It is as if the language of politics and the market has invaded the theatre. It also raises a fundamental question: is the National, conceived as a world library of drama and a radical alternative to the commercial theatre, gradually becoming a classier version of the West End? Has it lost sight of its original visionary idealism? Without wishing to pick over old bones, I would simply point to two alarming precedents. The last three shows in the Lyttelton - Noises Off, Life x 3 and My Fair Lady - have all, in effect, been co-productions virtually certain of a commercial transfer; there is all the difference in the world between productions such as Copenhagen or Blue/ Orange that transfer because of their unforeseen success and productions that are conceived from the outset as exploitable hits. The other question concerns Nunn's own ambivalent role as both the National's artistic boss and director of some of its most temptingly commercial prospects (as well, of course, as a number of less profitable shows). In a sense, his very talent leaves him vulnerable, however unfairly, to the accusation of using the National as a commercial launchpad. His roster of productions for the next 16 months, for instance, is formidable: having overseen the Drury Lane transfer of My Fair Lady, he'll direct The Relapse, South Pacific, Oklahoma on Broadway, a Tom Stoppard trilogy and Glenn Close in A Streetcar Named Desire. All but The Relapse are seen inside the National as potentially huge earners for both the institution and the director. Joan Bakewell, a member of the National Theatre board, regards as \"preposterous\" the idea that Nunn's choice of work is dictated by purely commercial considerations; she points also to his enthusiasm for bringing work in from the regions and to the National's multifarious access programmes. Hogg describes the arrival of My Fair Lady and South Pacific in one year as \"a matter of chance more than anything\" and points to the fact that the assumed profits will make other things possible. All the same, the close juxtaposition of two Broadway blockbusters strikes me as a public relations disaster: they may bring in the customers but they will increase the perception that the National is turning into a musical-dominated, quasi- commercial organisation. Hogg's answer to all this is that the National has not lost sight of its basic principles but that it has to change with the times. \"The reality,\" he says, \"is that our grant will be 36% of our total costs in the current year, whereas in the past it has been well over 60% - it has come down steadily as the grant has been held in real terms or diminished. What has also changed is the whole political and cultural environment in which we operate. We watch that all the time and try to change the institution accordingly.\" In what way? \"If necessary we go into continuous runs in order to balance the books, which is our sacred, overriding rule. The balance of the repertory also constantly changes. The advent of the musical is easily the most marked difference between now and the 1960s, while there are probably fewer European classics. But our aim is to produce theatre of the highest quality, to mix mainstream classics, new plays and musicals and to be as accessible to as wide a range of people as possible.\" A 2,500-seat theatre complex has to exist in the real world, and I would not question all of the Nunn-Hogg priorities. But it makes me wonder if an alternative vision of the National is not possible: one closer to the original Olivier ideal. Why, for instance, is it assumed that musicals are the only way of attracting a popular audience? Isn't the need to embrace world drama just as \"sacred\" a duty as that of balancing the books? And is a Broadway transfer the ultimate theatrical goal? What we need is a new broom. And, while everyone is tight-lipped about Nunn's successor, my understanding is that, when his current contract expires in September 2002, he will stay on for an indeterminate period to pave the way for the new appointee. Nicholas Hytner, Howard Davies, Jude Kelly and John Caird are all in the frame - given that Sam Mendes and Stephen Daldry are busy pursuing their film careers - and the odds on Kelly are shortening daily. Whoever gets the job, however, I hope they banish marketplace rhetoric and remember that even the biggest artistic institutions survive only if personal ambition is balanced by a selfless idealism.",

      "body": "<p>Paddy and Mandy Godfrey live in the heartlands of the chattering classes, in desirable Gibson Square, Islington. Like many people they stand to make a huge profit if they sell their house. </p> <p>They moved into the house, purchased in 1964 for \u00a36,000, at a time when Islington was considered downmarket. But times have changed, their home is now worth almost a million and Islington has become one of the most desirable places to live in the capital. </p> <p>The Godfrey's are among the homeowners featured in a new Channel 4 series called Home Stories, which explores the rise of the home owning classes and its impact on the landscape. In a series of four programmes, winners and losers in the property game talk about their experiences. We hear from country dwellers and urbanites and those who like loft living. </p> <p>Britain's love affair with property has become stronger over the past 20 years: nearly 70% of us now own our own homes. In areas where demand for housing is high we're prepared to pay many thousands for what are often quite modest abodes. </p> <p>Clare Paterson, the series' producer, says we're now a nation of property addicts and the point of the series is to look at how that has come about and how fast. \"There was a time, not that long ago, when a trip to the building society to ask for a mortgage meant putting on a smart dress - you thought they were really doing you a favour if they considered it.\" </p> <p>Within a generation something that was considered risky and a very big deal is now taken for granted by the majority of the population, she says. And our hunger shows no signs of abating. The stock market may be jittery, but house prices are rising again, according to a Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors report published in February. The housing market is set to rise by 6% in the coming year, said the surveyors. </p> <p>And this week the Nationwide also said that prices were picking up, increasing by 1.4% in March. </p> <p>The debate about what kind of houses we should build and renovate, which programmes like Home Stories feed into, continues apace. While the transformation of industrial warehouses, and even local authority tower blocks, into chic apartments has continued largely unquestioned, there are plenty of flash points. </p> <p>Outside the major cities, architects' berate volume house developers for a lack of imagination when it comes to building modern homes. They complain that new developments are little more than an amalgam of Victorian and Georgian styles with a dash of double-glazing. </p> <p>In their defence, builders argue that they only provide what locals and planners want. As Ann Lever, associate sales and marketing director in the north west region of Countryside Properties, says: \"They set out to build homes that look, well-established, not new.\" </p> <p>Countryside is recreating a formal Georgian square on an 85-acre brown-field site to the north of Warrington, Cheshire, in the former grounds of Winwick Hospital. The development, at Nostell Place, will consist of a tree-lined boulevard, comprising grand two and three-storey Regency-style houses. The aim is to \"create a typical Cheshire village that looks as if it has evolved over time\". </p> <p>Ms Lever says local consultations show people want buildings in keeping with their surroundings. \"Residents want traditional-looking homes,\" she says. \"We try to achieve it - whether it is the colour of the render or some other feature. The point is to ensure the properties don't stick out. Trees are also important to people and we plant hundreds and thousands of them. </p> <p>\"Time and again, people say they love elegant town houses and Victorian and Georgian elevations.\" </p> <p> Town houses also suit modern living, Ms Lever believes. Three floors means there's plenty of room for the family to spread out, room for someone to work quietly at home, or room for an elderly relative to live independently. </p> <p>To create the right look, the company spends a fair amount on the exterior elevations, says Ms Lever. Nostalgia may be the order of the day for the exterior. But inside their home, today's buyers want wooden floors, American fridges and range cookers with two ovens and six burners. Houses at Nostell Park, range from \u00a3315,000 to \u00a3369,950. </p> <p>In the countryside, locals are very sensitive about the impact of new homes upon the environment. Last month, the Guinness Trust received the Civic Trust rural housing award for a scheme that transformed a development of glorified beach huts into family housing. </p> <p>Jaywick in Essex is a collection of holiday chalets, built between the wars, which over time became permanent homes for their residents. The bungalows were not built to last and over time have become increasingly dilapidated. </p> <p>The Guinness Trust has built 40 new homes on the site, called Lotus Way, which reflect the beach-hut feel of the area. The design of the buildings won a RIBA award for the architects Pollard, Thomas and Edward. The new homes are the first stage of a larger regeneration project involving the trust and other local agencies. </p> <p>Other homes there need attention and the infrastructure is badly in need of updating. But the new homes have been welcomed as proof that regeneration can produce affordable housing that meets local needs and still be architecturally interesting. </p> <p>The UK's changing demographic is also having an impact on housing. Elderly people are living longer than ever before. By 2050 it is predicted that couples will live about 40 years after their children have left home. With this in mind developers are building homes for a new generation of empty-nesters, says Sunley Homes. </p> <p>The company's development, Cherry Orchard Mews, off church road in Littlebourne, Kent, consists of eight two and three-bedroom cottages set around a rose garden and a water feature. The company claims the buildings provide the equivalent floorspace to that offered by larger homes and are ideal for downsizers who do not want to compromise on living space.

      "bodyText": "Paddy and Mandy Godfrey live in the heartlands of the chattering classes, in desirable Gibson Square, Islington. Like many people they stand to make a huge profit if they sell their house. They moved into the house, purchased in 1964 for \u00a36,000, at a time when Islington was considered downmarket. But times have changed, their home is now worth almost a million and Islington has become one of the most desirable places to live in the capital. The Godfrey's are among the homeowners featured in a new Channel 4 series called Home Stories, which explores the rise of the home owning classes and its impact on the landscape. In a series of four programmes, winners and losers in the property game talk about their experiences. We hear from country dwellers and urbanites and those who like loft living. Britain's love affair with property has become stronger over the past 20 years: nearly 70% of us now own our own homes. In areas where demand for housing is high we're prepared to pay many thousands for what are often quite modest abodes. Clare Paterson, the series' producer, says we're now a nation of property addicts and the point of the series is to look at how that has come about and how fast. \"There was a time, not that long ago, when a trip to the building society to ask for a mortgage meant putting on a smart dress - you thought they were really doing you a favour if they considered it.\" Within a generation something that was considered risky and a very big deal is now taken for granted by the majority of the population, she says. And our hunger shows no signs of abating. The stock market may be jittery, but house prices are rising again, according to a Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors report published in February. The housing market is set to rise by 6% in the coming year, said the surveyors. And this week the Nationwide also said that prices were picking up, increasing by 1.4% in March. The debate about what kind of houses we should build and renovate, which programmes like Home Stories feed into, continues apace. While the transformation of industrial warehouses, and even local authority tower blocks, into chic apartments has continued largely unquestioned, there are plenty of flash points. Outside the major cities, architects' berate volume house developers for a lack of imagination when it comes to building modern homes. They complain that new developments are little more than an amalgam of Victorian and Georgian styles with a dash of double-glazing. In their defence, builders argue that they only provide what locals and planners want. As Ann Lever, associate sales and marketing director in the north west region of Countryside Properties, says: \"They set out to build homes that look, well-established, not new.\" Countryside is recreating a formal Georgian square on an 85-acre brown-field site to the north of Warrington, Cheshire, in the former grounds of Winwick Hospital. The development, at Nostell Place, will consist of a tree-lined boulevard, comprising grand two and three-storey Regency-style houses. The aim is to \"create a typical Cheshire village that looks as if it has evolved over time\". Ms Lever says local consultations show people want buildings in keeping with their surroundings. \"Residents want traditional-looking homes,\" she says. \"We try to achieve it - whether it is the colour of the render or some other feature. The point is to ensure the properties don't stick out. Trees are also important to people and we plant hundreds and thousands of them. \"Time and again, people say they love elegant town houses and Victorian and Georgian elevations.\" Town houses also suit modern living, Ms Lever believes. Three floors means there's plenty of room for the family to spread out, room for someone to work quietly at home, or room for an elderly relative to live independently. To create the right look, the company spends a fair amount on the exterior elevations, says Ms Lever. Nostalgia may be the order of the day for the exterior. But inside their home, today's buyers want wooden floors, American fridges and range cookers with two ovens and six burners. Houses at Nostell Park, range from \u00a3315,000 to \u00a3369,950. In the countryside, locals are very sensitive about the impact of new homes upon the environment. Last month, the Guinness Trust received the Civic Trust rural housing award for a scheme that transformed a development of glorified beach huts into family housing. Jaywick in Essex is a collection of holiday chalets, built between the wars, which over time became permanent homes for their residents. The bungalows were not built to last and over time have become increasingly dilapidated. The Guinness Trust has built 40 new homes on the site, called Lotus Way, which reflect the beach-hut feel of the area. The design of the buildings won a RIBA award for the architects Pollard, Thomas and Edward. The new homes are the first stage of a larger regeneration project involving the trust and other local agencies. Other homes there need attention and the infrastructure is badly in need of updating. But the new homes have been welcomed as proof that regeneration can produce affordable housing that meets local needs and still be architecturally interesting. The UK's changing demographic is also having an impact on housing. Elderly people are living longer than ever before. By 2050 it is predicted that couples will live about 40 years after their children have left home. With this in mind developers are building homes for a new generation of empty-nesters, says Sunley Homes. The company's development, Cherry Orchard Mews, off church road in Littlebourne, Kent, consists of eight two and three-bedroom cottages set around a rose garden and a water feature. The company claims the buildings provide the equivalent floorspace to that offered by larger homes and are ideal for downsizers who do not want to compromise on living space. The cottages start at \u00a3170,000. In London, where pressure on housing is immense, builders await the mayor Ken Livingstone's housing guidance, due shortly. It is expected to include increased targets for affordable housing. Whatever the homes of the future look like, there is a general consensus that more of them need to be affordable. Homeowners want and expect to make money on their properties, says Clare Paterson. And for now, thoughts of risky ventures, or memories of the property crash of the late eighties, have been firmly consigned to the backs of our minds. \u0095 Channel 4's Home Stories 8pm, April 12.",

      "bodyText": "Bosnian Croats stoned Nato peacekeepers and attacked staff of international organisations yesterday after police and troops seized a major bank used by Bosnian Croat hardliners bent on setting up their own mini-state. Twenty-one peacekeepers were slightly injured in the melee in the southwestern city of Mostar, Nato spokesman Lieutenant Lars Anderson said. They were from the United States, Italy, France, Spain and Morocco, he said. Four Bosnian civilians were injured, Mostar radio said. In Rome, officials said 11 of the injured peacekeepers were Italian paramilitary police. The trouble started when armed UN and Bosnian police backed by Nato troops seized the Mostar headquarters of the bank, Hercegovacka Banka, and 10 branches throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina. The hardline Croatian Democratic Union is believed to use the bank to promote its campaign to establish a separate Croat-run mini-state, said Ralph Johnson, deputy to the chief international administrator, Wolfgang Petritsch. \"I want to make clear that the international community's campaign to make sure that those who fund illegal structures are dealt with will continue,\" Mr Johnson said. The raid triggered rioting in Mostar, 45 miles southwest of Sarajevo and a stronghold of the Croatian Democratic Union, known as HDZ. During the takeover, mobs swarmed the bank's headquarters, beat police and international officials, destroyed records and looted the building, Mr Johnson said. Crowds attacked Nato vehicles, overturning several and setting one on fire. Gunshots rang out in the streets. Nato closed the main bridge across the Neretva River dividing the city into Muslim and Croat zones and called in reinforcements from around the country. The HDZ called the raid \"armed robbery\", and the president of the bank's board of directors, Ante Ljubic, refused to accept the authority of the new manager, Tobi Robinson. \"We also request that Robinson and her armed escort immediately leave the units of Hercegovacka Banka and allow the legal administration to enter the bank,\" Mr Ljubic said. In the Croatian capital, Zagreb, the Bosnian foreign minister, Zlatko Lagumdzija, backed the raid, saying the bank's management had long been \"dubious\". The takeover could prevent \"a dream of all extremists from coming true: that the national banks would be in one nation's hands and the national money in the pockets of national thugs,\" he said. Tensions have been rising in Croat areas after the HDZ declared last month that it would break off its alliance with the country's Muslims and set up a Croat government. Under the 1995 Dayton peace agreement that ended the Bosnian war, the country was divided into a Serb-run mini-state and a Muslim-Croat federation. After the war, the HDZ maintained parallel government institutions in southwestern Bosnia over the objections of international administrators. However, many Croats felt they had been shortchanged in the division of power. Mr Petritsch fired the Croat president, Ante Jelavic, and other Croat officials last month over the secessionist threat. International officials suspected the HDZ of planning to finance its mini-state with proceeds from the Hercegovacka Banka. Related special reports Serbia Kosovo Macedonia",

      "bodyText": "US officials held a second meeting with the 24 US aircrew detained by China on Hainan island yesterday as the pace of diplomatic activity between Washington and Beijing picked up. President George Bush told Americans that the crew were \"doing just fine\", and added: \"We think we're making progress.\" But Beijing reported that there had been another clash between US and Chinese planes off its coast only two days ago, and there were reports in Washington of strains between hawks and doves in the administration as the crisis dragged on. \"The crew is in great spirits. They are all together and are looking forward to being released and returning home,\" Brigadier Neal Sealock said after spending an hour with the 24 detained servicemen . Brig Sealock, the US military attache in Beijing, reported by telephone to Mr Bush in Washington shortly after the meeting ended. Unlike Tuesday's meeting between US diplomats and the crew, there were no Chinese officials present yesterday. A further meeting is expected today. The secretary of state, Colin Powell, said the crew were being \"cared for well\" and that arrangements were being made to see them \"on a regular basis until this matter is resolved.\" He gave an upbeat account of progress in the round-the-clock meetings in the two capitals. They were discussing \"rather precise ideas\", he said. \"There has been movement in the discussions and negotiations. And we are encouraged at this point, and those discussions continue.\" Publicly, the administration remained united behind the diplomatic path followed this week. But the defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, known as a China hawk, was reported in the conservative Washing ton Times to have criticised the White House's \"soft tone towards Beijing\". \"Rumsfeld is worn out by the diplomats, all the statements of 'regret' and wants to stop the patty-cakes,\" the paper reported, quoting a defence source. \"He and Powell are very much at odds over this.\" President Jiang Zemin, who is touring Latin America, repeated his demand for a US apology, but in a more relaxed tone. He said: \"It is normal for people to ask forgiveness or say 'excuse me' when they collide in the street. But the American planes come to the border of our country and do not ask for forgiveness. Is this behaviour acceptable?\" US diplomats in Haikou, who had been buying fresh clothes and other supplies for the crew, were escorted to the guesthouse where they are being held in a motorcade of the black limousines with tinted windows used by all Chinese officials. Earlier the US ambassador, Joseph Prueher, said in Beijing that the planned visit was \"a good sign, and we are having good contacts.\" Later he described the talks with Chinese officials as \"fairly intense\". Meanwhile it was reported in China that 10 Chinese fighters had to \"warn off five US spy planes\" on Wednesday. \"Under the close watch of our aircraft,\" an unidentified source in Beijing said, \"the US spy planes eventually scampered out of China's coastal areas.\" The Hong Kong daily Wen Wei Po, which supports Beijing, claimed that 63 US surveillance aircraft had been detected \"in Chinese coastal areas\" since the beginning of the year, and said that the US had sent 950 such planes last year. The English-language China Daily said that US reconnaissance of Hainan Island began in 1970, during the Vietnam War. It said the US was refusing to apologise because it did not want to set a precedent.

      "body": "<p>Tony Blair yesterday sniffed a set of replica Viking toilets to launch his campaign to kickstart the rural tourism industry. The irony was that he chose to visit a city attraction not hit by foot and mouth.</p> <p>In contrast to previous stony-faced visits to farmers, Mr Blair beamed ecstatically as he and his wife, Cherie, arrived at the Jorvik Viking Centre in York.</p> <p>As they made their way through 100 children with napkins on their heads pretending to be Nordic warriors, the Blairs brandished an instant camera, taking their own snaps as if on holiday. They grabbed people indiscriminately, shaking their hands, particularly those who looked like tourists.</p> <p>At one stage, Mr Blair spied a Japanese man with a camera round his neck, rushed over and gave him a hug. When Haroshi Yamamoto told Mr Blair he was actually a London-based journalist for JHK Japanese Broadcasting Corporation, the prime minister said, \"Oh\", and his arm went limp.</p> <p>Regional tourist boards estimate they are losing \u00a3200m a week because of the foot and mouth crisis, a figure that could quadruple over Easter. Yorkshire tourism lost around \u00a375m last month. British tourism will lose at least \u00a35bn by September, according to the British Hospitality Association.</p> <p>Mr Blair yesterday announced a \u00a36m government-funded campaign to tell the world that British tourism is alive and well during the foot and mouth crisis.

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair yesterday sniffed a set of replica Viking toilets to launch his campaign to kickstart the rural tourism industry. The irony was that he chose to visit a city attraction not hit by foot and mouth. In contrast to previous stony-faced visits to farmers, Mr Blair beamed ecstatically as he and his wife, Cherie, arrived at the Jorvik Viking Centre in York. As they made their way through 100 children with napkins on their heads pretending to be Nordic warriors, the Blairs brandished an instant camera, taking their own snaps as if on holiday. They grabbed people indiscriminately, shaking their hands, particularly those who looked like tourists. At one stage, Mr Blair spied a Japanese man with a camera round his neck, rushed over and gave him a hug. When Haroshi Yamamoto told Mr Blair he was actually a London-based journalist for JHK Japanese Broadcasting Corporation, the prime minister said, \"Oh\", and his arm went limp. Regional tourist boards estimate they are losing \u00a3200m a week because of the foot and mouth crisis, a figure that could quadruple over Easter. Yorkshire tourism lost around \u00a375m last month. British tourism will lose at least \u00a35bn by September, according to the British Hospitality Association. Mr Blair yesterday announced a \u00a36m government-funded campaign to tell the world that British tourism is alive and well during the foot and mouth crisis. As well as full page ads in British news papers, Mr Blair used interviews with American, French and Japanese media to proclaim that the British countryside was generally open for business. Outside the Jorvik Viking Centre, in a square where the only sign of country life was the hanging baskets of pansies outside Boots the chemist, Mr Blair said the best way to stimulate tourism was to attract visitors rather than government compensation. \"The main thing tourism needs is people, trade and business. The most important thing to get across to people is that Britain is open and there is no problem with people coming over. We have simply got to get across a proper sense of perspective.\" Asked if the correct perspective was actually that tourists might spread the disease on rural footpaths, Mr Blair said: \"Of course it is essential that we ensure proper restrictions so that people do not go on footpaths near livestock farms.\" A spokeswoman for the Jorvik Viking Centre said she was \"not at all\" worried by foot and mouth as the centre was in a popular city centre location. The museum will reopen tomorrow after a five-month closure and \u00a35m refurbishment. It expects 500,000 visitors this year with no shortfall due to foot and mouth. Matthew Wilson, a York tourist guide who runs city walks such as \"Public Conveniences Through the Ages\" said city tourism had not been hit in the same way that small country businesses had. \"We have had the normal numbers of tourists on city walks.

He planned to spend part of his holiday on a farm in Gloucester. Cumbria county council yesterday announced it was to rethink \"no entry\" signs on some footpaths, to attract tourists back to the region. But the local National Farmers' Union leader Steve Heaton advised caution. Mr and Mrs Blair later visited the Bronte's parsonage at Haworth, a popular tourist destination which is 5km from the nearest foot and mouth case, and has signs in Japanese warning tourists to follow foot and mouth precautions. The deputy prime minister, John Prescott, went sailing on the Norfolk Broads, and toured Shropshire and Cheshire to set an example for tourists.

Dogged by the adverse publicity caused by attempts to punish developing countries for seeking cheap alternative drugs, the pharmaceutical industry has struck a deal with the European Union that will allow millions more each year to be saved from death from preventable diseases. The proposal - backed by Clare Short, the international development secretary - involves a sliding scale of prices, ranging from cost prices for the world's poorest nations to substantial discounts for the middle-income countries of Latin America and Asia. Industry sources privately admitted that a Johannesburg court case brought by 39 of the big drug companies to block the South African government's imports of cheap Aids drugs had been a public relations disaster. Under the EU plan, which will be discussed at a meeting in Norway tomorrow of World Health Organisation and World Trade Organisation experts from around the world, drugs companies would commit themselves to supplying key medicines at the lowest possible prices. Treatable diseases such as tuberculosis, pneumonia and malaria kill more than 10m people each year in the developing world but the costs of the drugs to attack them are beyond the reach of most developing countries' health budgets. Many of the biggest companies have slashed the prices of Aids drugs since the South African court case began, in an attempt to restore their reputation. The EU plan would replace one-off discounts for specific countries with a comprehensive pricing agreement which would apply to all the world's poorest countries. The industry has seized on the discount scheme as a lifeline to protect it from campaigners' demands for patent rights on drugs to be weakened so that poor countries can make their own cheaper copies. Although world trade rules allow for patents to be overridden in national health emergencies, many poor countries are too afraid of the drug industry's lobbying power to take advantage of the provisions. Oxfam, which is calling for clarification of World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules so that poor countries are able to produce and import generic copies of essential drugs, said the EU plan was a step forward but did not go far enough. \"We welcome the European Union's push to negotiate a comprehensive agreement for discounted drugs but they shouldn't play into the game plan of the big pharmaceutical companies who are trying to deflect pressure for a more radical reform of WTO patent rules,\" said Justin Forsyth, head of policy at Oxfam. Oxfam said that the discount pricing plan should not be seen as a substitute for existing provisions in WTO rules. Patent rules will come under scrutiny later this year in Geneva and developing countries are expected to push for more flexibility in the trade related intellectual property rights agreement.

In its ambitious bid to create its own security and defence identity, and acquire some punch to match its economic weight, the EU has all but finalised a complex structure of military and diplomatic institutions in Brussels. Last November, despite concerns by British Eurosceptics, the 15 member states pledged thousands of troops, 400 combat aircraft and 100 ships for a rapid reaction force to operate in future crises that do not involve Nato. The 60,000-strong force, capable of being deployed for up to a year, is scheduled to be ready for peacekeeping and humanitarian duties by 2003. But problems concerning coordination with Nato have delayed progress. The conference scheduled for November will look at sensitive and expensive military hardware such as intelligence capabilities, sophisticated communications, and heavy transport aircraft, the lion's share of which is currently provided by the US. \"We need to see real new commitments to address the shortcomings in these areas,\" Mr Solana said, recalling that European public opinion broadly supports having a more effective EU foreign and security policy. \"Ministers need to defend the need for adequate resources and must be the advocates with their own governments and parliaments.\" Alain Richard, the French defence minister, played down earlier calls for the rapid reaction force to have its own planning capability, independent of Nato, a position opposed by other governments worried about damaging transatlantic relations - and grist to the eurosceptic mill. Diplomats also brushed over a row about the appointment of a general from Finland, a non-Nato neutral, to head the EU's military committee in Brussels. Its military staff is headed by a German general with a British deputy. Italy, which wanted the job for one of its own generals, had protested about the way votes were cast. The Finn's appointment is to be confirmed by foreign ministers in Luxembourg on Monday. Addressing the problems with Nato, the German defence minister, Rudolf Scharping, urged Turkey to stop blocking the EU force. Turkey, a veteran member of Nato which feels shunned by the EU, wants a bigger say in the rapid reaction force's decision-making, despite being outside the union. The EU says this is unacceptable because it would in effect give the Turks a veto on future operations. \"We hope Turkey will reconsider its policy and will take a cooperative line,\" Mr Scharping said. \"It is in the interests of Turkey to take the perspective of cooperation with the EU.\"",

One area producers hoped would turn into a money spinner was distance learning. No longer. This week the mighty Massachusetts Institute of Technology said it would make its courses freely available on the internet. Who would care to compete with MIT by charging money for inferior material? On the internet the consumer, not the producer, is king and looks unlikely to be dethroned this year.",

This editorial went as far as to argue that the monarchy cannot survive. For the first time, the private instincts of the Australo-American Murdoch have become the public policy of his papers. Whatever other substances those around the royals may have sniffed, the Queen is going to need her smelling salts this weekend. comment@theguardian.com Useful links R-JH public relations Buckingham palace biography of Duke of Wessex Sophie Wessex fan site",

It is ironic. Jesus, who is the true praise of God, is also, on the cross, the accursed of God. As Carter concludes his hymn, he reminds us of the foolishness of the cross: \"It's God they ought to crucify instead of you and me/I said to the carpenter a-hanging on the tree.\"</p> <p>Precisely. Here hangs one \"who saved others, but cannot save himself\". In choosing to be cursed with betrayal, torture, abandonment and death, the lamb of God becomes an apparently ordinary scapegoat. Our swearing, cursing and vilification is finally directed against God.

      "body": "<p>There is something awe-inspiring about the steady implosion of what was the country's leading retailer, Marks &amp; Spencer. And also something deeply sad. </p> <p>The financial detail contained in the group management accounts, revealed in The Guardian today, is devastating. Marks is in far worse shape than outsiders even speculated. Just about every division is in freefall - and as the business burns, the management are trying to throttle each other. These internal figures are now in the public domain because (we suspect) second tier management are furious that the chairman's bonus is likely to remain intact when their own awards have been struck out. They feel they are paying the price for failure at the top. </p> <p>According to the M&amp;S document, net debt will have increased by \u00a3129m over the year, compared with a reduction of about the same amount the previous year. </p> <p>The company now plans to return \u00a32bn to shareholders and its operational gearing will rise. This is a risky strategy. If sales rise, the bottom line will benefit more quickly, but if they continue to fall - and there is absolutely no sign that M&amp;S has the expertise at present to halt the slide - profits will be punished far more severely. </p> <p>Marks clearly needs instant and radical action, and it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the only way the company is going to get it is through a takeover - although, with 12 institutional shareholders holding more than 35% of the company, there are obvious barriers.

      "bodyText": "There is something awe-inspiring about the steady implosion of what was the country's leading retailer, Marks &amp; Spencer. And also something deeply sad. The financial detail contained in the group management accounts, revealed in The Guardian today, is devastating. Marks is in far worse shape than outsiders even speculated. Just about every division is in freefall - and as the business burns, the management are trying to throttle each other. These internal figures are now in the public domain because (we suspect) second tier management are furious that the chairman's bonus is likely to remain intact when their own awards have been struck out. They feel they are paying the price for failure at the top. According to the M&amp;S document, net debt will have increased by \u00a3129m over the year, compared with a reduction of about the same amount the previous year. The company now plans to return \u00a32bn to shareholders and its operational gearing will rise. This is a risky strategy. If sales rise, the bottom line will benefit more quickly, but if they continue to fall - and there is absolutely no sign that M&amp;S has the expertise at present to halt the slide - profits will be punished far more severely. Marks clearly needs instant and radical action, and it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the only way the company is going to get it is through a takeover - although, with 12 institutional shareholders holding more than 35% of the company, there are obvious barriers. But M&amp;S certainly does need a new commerical culture imposed from outside. Potential bidders will now have a much clearer idea about what they are taking on - and how little they might have to pay. With profitability per square foot of shop floor down by a quarter over the past 12 months (and still falling), the betting is it will not be the \u00a37.5bn at which the market capitalised this company last night.

Their estimate was \u00a359m below their prediction just three months previously, and the business has since suffered further blows. </p> <p>One section, outlining crucial performance indicators, shows the return on capital invested by the company crashing from 17.5% to 15.2%. Last September - the document spells out - the company had expected a substantial recovery, which would have produced a 19.9% return on capital. </p> <p>The company's costs, meanwhile, are on the increase. M&amp;S predicted that by the end of the year, costs would have risen from \u00a32bn to \u00a32.08bn. The stores' operating costs as a percentage of sales were forecast to rise from 31.6% to 33%. </p> <p>By the end of last year, its profits per square foot had crashed to \u00a312.80 from \u00a316.90 a year earlier - but the bombed-out clothing departments were faring far worse. In those departments, profits per square foot had slumped from \u00a318.90 to just \u00a39.40. </p> <p>Clothing department profits per employee halved from \u00a38,000 to \u00a34,000. </p> <p>Morale within the company is understood to have hit rock bottom, with many senior employees angry that they are to be denied their bonuses while chairman Luc Vandevelde is still in line to scoop a \u00a3650,000 performance-related cheque. </p> <p>The \u00a310m set aside to pay management bonuses at the beginning of the financial year has been released and will be used to boost profits instead. The company plans to hold its dividend at 9p. </p> <p>The chairman's payment was agreed by the company's remuneration committee, led by former MI5 chief Dame Stella Rimington, when he joined the company last year. However, if it is offered - and if Mr Vandevelde accepts - several major shareholders are likely to protest. </p> <p>There is also mounting disquiet about some internal appointments. Several long-serving insiders are unhappy with the salaries being offered to lure in outside talent such as Michele Jobling, the former chief executive of Liberty who has taken control of the childrenswear business, and Yasmin Yusuf, the ex-Warehouse executive who has been hired as M&amp;S's new creative director. </p> <p>Questions are also being asked about why Maurice Helfgott has been appointed to turn around the badly underperforming menswear department. He previously ran the ventures department, which has chalked up a \u00a313m loss. </p> <p>The ventures included ie <a href=\"http://www.Splendour.com\">Splendour.com</a>, an online lingerie company, and Talkcast, a multimedia company, which have both failed to deliver. The \"new concept\" MSL lingerie shops, which were launched in Europe, lost \u00a3800,000 - and are now being shut down. </p> <p>The position of Barry Morris, the head of womenswear, is also under the spotlight, as he has presided over a string of collections which shoppers have spurned. </p> <p>One retail expert said: \"I am surprised at the severity of these figures, and especially at the fact that it is lingerie and menswear, rather than womenswear, which are having the worst time.\" </p> <p>The store chain cut prices in menswear by \u00a332m - and far from generating extra sales, the move actually cut profits by more than \u00a317m. Womenswear prices were reduced by \u00a362m, but the new prices pulled in only \u00a312.5m extra profit. </p> <p>To make up for those price cuts, the group's lingerie prices were raised by \u00a323.5m - and customers walked away rather than pay more. </p> <p>Altogether more than \u00a3400m of unsold stock had to be discounted in the annual winter sale. The changes in staff costs - which show savings in the stores being more than wiped out by payroll increases at head office - are also unusual. Store chains normally try to trim central costs ahead of front-line store costs. \"That is likely to be counterproductive,\" said the retail insider. </p> <p>The retail chain's decision to accept credit cards has also adversely affected bottom line profits. </p> <p>According to the internal documents seen by the Guardian, it will have cost the group \u00a331m to accept cards this year. At the same time, the number of M&amp;S charge cards issued to new customers has collapsed from 172,000 to 50,000. </p> <p>A M&amp;S spokesman said: \"It was always going to cost us money to take credit cards, but there was a huge groundswell urging us to do so.

      "bodyText": "The comings and goings filmed at Paris's poshest hotel, Le Crillon, had nothing to do with the protocol surrounding visits by world leaders and top stars. Nor, despite the title Une Americaine \u00e0 Paris, did the hottest video in town pretend to be a female homage to the Gene Kelly classic. \"I'm afraid, Monsieur, it contained the sort of scenes that would be more appropriate to a vulgar hotel de passe ,\" a member of the staff said when asked why Le Crillon had asked the courts to censor an hour's free publicity shot in its precincts on the Place de la Concorde. \"We certainly never gave permission to shoot this disgusting display - the episode was done secretly.\" Pascal Malbequi, head of the legal department of the hotel's owners, the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 du Louvre', told Reuters news agency: \"It is unquestionably a blow to the image and the reputation of our luxury palace. \"Our customers would not be very pleased to know that they could appear in such movies without being aware of it.\" A clue to the dignified anger emanating from the staid establishment with its \u00a3500-a-night rooms was the cinematic presence of Rocco Siffredi, Italy's outstanding porno star. His mammoth member is a celebrity in itself after featuring in a general circuit film called Romance. No one was saying who in the Le Crillon management got hold of the video circulating almost clandestinely in the city's sex shops. But whoever it was had no trouble recognising the hotel. Much of the film is devoted to the Italian stallion checking in before the inevitable X-otic bedding of an American woman in a suite usually leased to millionaires and ministers. The most exclusive salons served as free sets throughout and, if porno freaks had any doubts about the location, the hotel's insignia could be read on a porter's uniform and cap. Along with the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 du Louvre, the porter persuaded the Paris court this week to order the Hungarian production company RSP to cut out all images of himself and Le Crillon - amounting to 13 minutes - and remove its name from the jacket. In addition the company was awarded about \u00a33,000 damages, and the unwitting extra was awarded \u00a310,000. But the coupling will stand. And the cut version will be back on the shelves next week, according to a sex-shop owner, Emmanuel Lehne. He expects big sales, he said, \"because Siffredi's equipment is better known architecture than the Crillon\".",

      "body": "<p>France joined the US yesterday in condemning as provocative Israel's plan to expand Jewish settlement in the West Bank, a move that has incensed the Palestinians.</p> <p>The French rebuke to the government of the hardline rightwinger Ariel Sharon was unusually stark by diplomatic standards. It claimed Israel had lost direction since he took over last month.</p> <p>As Israeli tanks and helicopter gunships hit Gaza, damaging a power station and a police post, a French foreign ministry spokesman, Fran\u00e7ois Rivasseau, said: \"This downward spiral leads to more violence, more destruction and more suffering. The Israeli government has taken a wrong turning.\"</p> <p>He cited recent developments such as \"the provocative announcement of the resumption of settlements in the occupied territories, the continuation of so-called extra-judicial murders, the military clashes in Gaza and attacks on the safety of negotiators.\"</p> <p>France traditionally has been more inclined than other countries, especially Britain, to criticise Israel and take a more pro-Arab stance.</p> <p>Egypt, too, expressed alarm over the prospect of Israel consolidating its hold on parts of the West Bank by auctioning land for a further 700 houses.</p> <p>Palestinian leaders welcomed the US condemnation of the plan. The US state department called it provocative.</p> <p>There are 200,000 Jews living in often isolated pockets dotted around the West Bank and Gaza, among more than 3m Palestinians, who view the settlement expansion as part of a gradual land grab that has been going on for more than 50 years.</p> <p>The strategy of Mr Sharon, who initially pursued much the same policy as his predecessor, Ehud Barak, is becoming clearer. Whereas Mr Barak took reprisals for Palestinian attacks, Mr Sharon has opted for pre-emptive punitive strikes.</p> <p>The aim appears to be to try to bomb the Palestinians back to the negotiating table.</p> <p>Mr Sharon's spokesman, Raanan Gissin, said Israel will retaliate \"relentlessly from now on and Palestinian security installations will be considered targets as long as security forces fail to prevent attacks on Israelis\".</p> <p>The Israeli internal security minister, Uzi Landau, said its forces should hit Palestinian targets \"every day, hour after hour.\" He added: \"The price we will exact from the Palestinian Authority will become intolerable.\"</p> <p>In a hint of further assassinations by Israel, Mr Landau said Palestinian officials behind attacks on Israel are \"not immune to Israeli attack\" and that the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, should be declared a war criminal \"as one who specialises in attacking babies and shelling villages\".</p> <p>An Israeli helicopter attack on Gaza overnight was followed at daybreak by Palestinian mortar attacks on the Israeli settlement of Netzarim, south of Gaza city. Israeli tanks returned fire.</p> <p>There was also the by now almost ritual stone-throwing in Jerusalem by Palestinians returning from Friday prayers in the Old City.

      "bodyText": "France joined the US yesterday in condemning as provocative Israel's plan to expand Jewish settlement in the West Bank, a move that has incensed the Palestinians. The French rebuke to the government of the hardline rightwinger Ariel Sharon was unusually stark by diplomatic standards. It claimed Israel had lost direction since he took over last month. As Israeli tanks and helicopter gunships hit Gaza, damaging a power station and a police post, a French foreign ministry spokesman, Fran\u00e7ois Rivasseau, said: \"This downward spiral leads to more violence, more destruction and more suffering. The Israeli government has taken a wrong turning.\" He cited recent developments such as \"the provocative announcement of the resumption of settlements in the occupied territories, the continuation of so-called extra-judicial murders, the military clashes in Gaza and attacks on the safety of negotiators.\" France traditionally has been more inclined than other countries, especially Britain, to criticise Israel and take a more pro-Arab stance. Egypt, too, expressed alarm over the prospect of Israel consolidating its hold on parts of the West Bank by auctioning land for a further 700 houses. Palestinian leaders welcomed the US condemnation of the plan. The US state department called it provocative. There are 200,000 Jews living in often isolated pockets dotted around the West Bank and Gaza, among more than 3m Palestinians, who view the settlement expansion as part of a gradual land grab that has been going on for more than 50 years. The strategy of Mr Sharon, who initially pursued much the same policy as his predecessor, Ehud Barak, is becoming clearer. Whereas Mr Barak took reprisals for Palestinian attacks, Mr Sharon has opted for pre-emptive punitive strikes. The aim appears to be to try to bomb the Palestinians back to the negotiating table. Mr Sharon's spokesman, Raanan Gissin, said Israel will retaliate \"relentlessly from now on and Palestinian security installations will be considered targets as long as security forces fail to prevent attacks on Israelis\". The Israeli internal security minister, Uzi Landau, said its forces should hit Palestinian targets \"every day, hour after hour.\" He added: \"The price we will exact from the Palestinian Authority will become intolerable.\" In a hint of further assassinations by Israel, Mr Landau said Palestinian officials behind attacks on Israel are \"not immune to Israeli attack\" and that the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, should be declared a war criminal \"as one who specialises in attacking babies and shelling villages\". An Israeli helicopter attack on Gaza overnight was followed at daybreak by Palestinian mortar attacks on the Israeli settlement of Netzarim, south of Gaza city. Israeli tanks returned fire. There was also the by now almost ritual stone-throwing in Jerusalem by Palestinians returning from Friday prayers in the Old City. Injuries were minor. But the tension in Jerusalem is set to rise after Mr Sharon's announcement on Thursday that he had asked his security agencies to make arrangements for Jews to visit the disputed religious site, known to Arabs as Haram-ash-Sharif and to Jews as Temple Mount. Since the Palestinian uprising began, few other than Muslims have been allowed to visit the site. Mr Arafat's office warned that the order would increase the cycle of violence in the region and called on Islamic officials \"to prevent Israel from [taking] this destructive step and insulting the holy places\". In the West Bank, a leading Islamic militant killed in a boobytrapped phone explosion was buried in the town of Jenin. Eight men in white robes, meant to symbolise death shrouds of suicide bombers, carried the flag-draped body of Iyad Hardan through the streets, followed by some 5,000 mourners demanding revenge.

The real test of loyalty was whether anyone would crack and reveal just what occurred on a Dendron farm two weeks ago, and the whereabouts of a corpse that had been found and lost by the police.</p> <p>The Noordelike rugby club in Pietersburg has taken in a lot of new players recently. So when the squad met two Saturdays ago for a practice session it was as much about team-building as tactics.</p> <p>After the practice, Riaan Botha invited a dozen of his team-mates back to the family farm to continue the bonding session. The group was made up of the sons of white farmers. Among those who took up the invitation were the established players - Johan Van Ravenstein, the club chairman; Jaco Hartslief, the match secretary; and two members of the club's executive, Ben Korff and Kobus Joubert, a lieutenant in the South African army. With them came some of the latest recruits including the youngest of the group, Francois Viljoen, who is just 19 years old. All those people named are charged with murder, along with Mike Adendorf, Corne Kloppers and William Boshoff.</p> <p>The 13 men watched rugby on television and drank late into the evening. Four went home but the rest slept the night on the farm just outside Dendron, about 40 miles north of Pietersburg. The bonding continued on Sunday with a barbecue - a \"braai\" in South African parlance - a lot more beer and brandy. Riaan Botha produced a couple of rifles and suggested a little hunting later.</p> <p>Tshepo Matloga and his cousins, Alex and Melford Motlokwane, did not know about the party just a few hundred yards away as they slipped through the fence with about 10 dogs on a hunting expedition. They were looking for hares to eat or to sell. The black teenagers were trespassing, but they were not carrying weapons and what they were poaching was of no value to the Botha family.</p> <p>Alex Motlokwane still does not know what gave them away. Perhaps it was a dog barking, but it was not long before Mr Botha and friends abandoned their \"braai\" for the hunting rifles.</p> <p><b> Dogs yelping</b><br></p> <p>The first Motlokwane knew of the white men's presence was a shot and one of the dogs yelping. The teenager turned to run and felt a sudden heat in his arm as a bullet caught him.</p> <p>\"We just went there for fun, for hunting. I saw people loom across the field and then the bullets started flying. I don't know where they came from. We ran in all directions,\" he said. At home in gaMokgehle village, Motlokwane's sister prompts him. \"Did they call you a 'kaffir'? Did they say they wanted to kill you?\" she asks. \"They were saying nothing. They were just shooting,\" he said.</p> <p>Motlokwane kept running. Another bullet hit his hand and a third one caught his ribs. Motlokwane glanced around for his cousins. One had disappeared but Tshepo Matloga was trying to get through the fence. Motlokwane turned and kept running until the shots died away.</p> <p>\"I slept on the farm because I didn't dare move in case they were still hunting me. In the morning I met a black woman who took me to another farm. The owner phoned the police,\" he said.</p> <p>A policeman questioned Alex Motlokwane. He was not sure what to say.</p> <p>\"I didn't really know what had happened. All I could say was that these boers were shooting at us. I told him I was lucky to be alive and I didn't know if the others were alive or dead,\" he said.</p> <p>The police decided to look for themselves. Just inside Botha's farm, close to the fence, they found a body. It was 19-year-old Tshepo Matloga.</p> <p>A police inspector - who the authorities decline to name - led his men in search of other evidence. They discovered a trail of dead dogs, rifle cartridges and beer cans. When they returned to re-examine the corpse, it was gone.</p> <p>Riaan Botha and his team-mates were in a panic. They reasoned that they had to get rid of Matloga's body because without a corpse who could ever prove there had been a murder?</p> <p>The men discussed a few options but settled on dumping Matloga in the Arabie dam 140 miles away. It was a long drive but they concluded the dam was best because it was full of crocodiles which would dispose of the evidence.</p> <p>The conspirators set off for an isolated part of the dam where one knew where to lay his hands on a boat. In the middle of the water, they lashed the corpse to an iron gatepost and tipped it over the side of the boat. So far as the men were concerned, that was the last time Tshepo Matloga would ever be seen.</p> <p>It left the police with a problem. They had discovered a dead body but lost the evidence, for which an inspector has been charged with negligence. They knew who the victim was because his cousins had spelled out the story but they could only speculate as to who had killed him.</p> <p>Still, Riaan Botha was wrong. In South Africa you can be tried for murder even when there is no body. The police arrested and charged eight of the men who were on the farm when Tshepo was killed. A ninth was added later.</p> <p>But it was going to be a difficult case to prove, particularly without at least one confession. The two survivors had been too busy saving their own skins to pay attention to Matloga's fate so they could not swear to the circumstances of his death. No one could even say how he died. The presumption was that he was shot. And the police's evident incompetence would not help them provide a convincing case before a judge.</p> <p>At first, none of the nine would talk but the silence was soon broken. After a few days, one of their number, who protested to the police that he did not take part in the killing, was persuaded to cooperate as an alternative to spending decades in jail for other people's crimes.</p> <p>He broke ranks and confessed what had happened on that Sunday afternoon. He also told the police where to look for Tshepo Matloga's body. The police called in divers to search the dam but after a week they still had not found the corpse.</p> <p>The black community said the white police inspector in charge was not interested in finding the body. He was replaced with a black officer. But it was luck that delivered the evidence. Botha and friends had been wrong about something else too. The Arabie dam is more than 100ft deep in parts. When they dumped Matloga's body overboard tied to the gate post it sank to a level below which crocodiles swim.</p> <p>Just as the police were about to abandon the search, Matloga's rotting corpse slipped free from the gate post and floated to the surface. The police were ahead of the crocodiles on that day.</p> <p>On the way to the mortuary Matloga's body was lost again, this time after being diverted to the wrong town. When it was recovered, a postmortem revealed that Matloga was beaten to death. He had a fractured skull and broken ribs.</p> <p>To many people, that made the crime all the worse. It was not a stray bullet or one man with a gun who killed Matloga but a brutal attack in which some of the men participated but none apparently tried to stop.</p> <p>On Thursday the nine appeared in court laughing. Their relatives appeared similarly buoyant. They seemed to expect that the Afrikaner magistrate would automatically free their men on bail. The crowd outside suspected the same thing and pressed their way into court. \"May you burn in hell,\" shouted one elderly black woman. A man held a sign: \"Nine boers, nine bullets\".</p> <p>Matloga's death touched a raw nerve in Dendron and Pietersburg where many black people believe little has changed since apartheid ended. Among the protesters demands at the court were for searches on other farms for people who have gone missing recently.</p> <p>The province has a long history of racism. The Northern Transvaal, as it then was, was the only part of South Africa to vote against political reform in the all-white referendum a decade ago.</p> <p>\"These boers commit a heinous crime knowing their brothers will let them off. The boers still think they have the power,\" said Thomas Ramaloko, a mourner at Matloga's wake in gaMokgehle. \"He died a terrible death. There's no doubt this was racially motivated.\"</p> <p>The nine appeared in court again yesterday. This time there was none of the jollity. They looked cowed and scared. Outside the crowd threatened to lynch the men if they were freed on bail. Even the defence lawyers did not object to a few more days in police custody.</p>",

The partnership is only a month old, and the question that will come to dominate Israeli and Palestinian politics is how long the dove and hawk can work together.</p> <p>In an interview with the Guardian he justified his presence in the cabinet on the grounds that by being there he could exert a moderating influence on Mr Sharon.</p> <p>\"I think I can be effective,\" he said. \"I am not there to add water to the soup. Sharon knows my views and I have not changed.\"</p> <p>Regardless of the increasing violence, much of it being inflicted by his own government, Mr Peres is optimistic about the chance of peace.</p> <p>When serious negotiations eventually began in the Middle East, he said, \"You will be surprised how fast it [peace and economic growth] can be.\"</p> <p>Throughout a blood-stained career Mr Sharon's instinct has been to resort to force, and events since he became prime minister a month ago suggest that little has changed.</p> <p>Mr Peres disputed this. \"I have known Sharon for 50 years. We did not agree politically, but we kept on a personal relationship. It is the first time he is becoming prime minister. I do not think he would like to wind up his term as prime minister having the country in flame and blood.\"</p> <p>Had Mr Sharon changed?</p> <p>\"I think the situation has changed. I think also that age does not necessarily have a negative impact on people. Arafat, Sharon and myself are together 232 years. It is a lot of time.

      "bodyText": "The Israeli foreign minister and Nobel peace laureate Shimon Peres is unapologetic that, having devoted so much of his life to the pursuit of peace, he has entered into a partnership with Ariel Sharon. The partnership is only a month old, and the question that will come to dominate Israeli and Palestinian politics is how long the dove and hawk can work together. In an interview with the Guardian he justified his presence in the cabinet on the grounds that by being there he could exert a moderating influence on Mr Sharon. \"I think I can be effective,\" he said. \"I am not there to add water to the soup. Sharon knows my views and I have not changed.\" Regardless of the increasing violence, much of it being inflicted by his own government, Mr Peres is optimistic about the chance of peace. When serious negotiations eventually began in the Middle East, he said, \"You will be surprised how fast it [peace and economic growth] can be.\" Throughout a blood-stained career Mr Sharon's instinct has been to resort to force, and events since he became prime minister a month ago suggest that little has changed. Mr Peres disputed this. \"I have known Sharon for 50 years. We did not agree politically, but we kept on a personal relationship. It is the first time he is becoming prime minister. I do not think he would like to wind up his term as prime minister having the country in flame and blood.\" Had Mr Sharon changed? \"I think the situation has changed. I think also that age does not necessarily have a negative impact on people. Arafat, Sharon and myself are together 232 years. It is a lot of time. It must have some promise of wisdom and experience.\" While Mr Sharon punishes the Palestinians with an economic blockade, rocket attacks and assassinations, it is Mr Peres's job to be the acceptable international face of the government and to open channels to the Palestinians. Symbols of peace If Mr Sharon allows it, it will be through Mr Peres that peace negotiations will eventually resume. He met his Palestinian counterpart in Athens on Wednesday, the first high-level contact between the two sides since Mr Sharon took office. \"After a long interruption, the mere meeting was a departure from the monopoly of guns,\" he said. Mr Peres's office in a high-rise block in Tel Aviv is filled with symbols of peace: statues of women holding doves and olive branches; a buddha; and, in the most prominent spot of all, a blow-up of him signing the Oslo peace accord in 1993 with the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat. Mr Sharon described Oslo as appeasement. Mr Peres plays down the insult. \"Politicians have a collection of so many expressions, some of them right, some of them wrong. I think this expression is a wrong expression.\" Had it been vanity, at the age of 77, to seek power one more time? He replied: \"I am sure the person who said it is free of vanity.\" But he added: \"It is not a competition of beauty, not even a competition of politicians. It is a very serious situation.

Until last year Israel was hoping to negotiate a peace deal with Syria, but Mr Peres confirmed that there was little chance of pursuing that track in the near future. \"I am not saying it has no future, but there is no present,\" he said. \"Bashar looks like he studied ophthalmology in London, but his vision is even more short-sighted than his father's.

It was, he said, aimed at trying to put back on the table the final offer made this year by Mr Barak and Bill Clinton, an offer Mr Arafat had rejected. \"Once rejected, they no longer exist,\" Mr Peres said. Did he rule out Israel simply leaving the West Bank and Gaza, an option considered but discarded by the previous government? \"The borders are very complicated. Time didn't stand still and what once was two eggs is now omelettes, which are hard to divide and organise.\" There were other problems: the future of Jerusalem, the fate of the Palestinian refugees and the issue of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza. He said he had extracted a promise from Mr Sharon that there would be no new settlements, though it was announced on Thursday that existing ones would be expanded, which, to the Palestinians, is just as bad.

      "body": "<p>It was once the cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre of animal activists around the world. But for a decade, the annual Canadian seal hunt has managed to continue uninterrupted by claiming a new air of respectability and concern for the welfare of the animals.</p> <p>Now a damning report from an international panel of wildlife vets is set to reignite demands for a crackdown by the Canadian authorities on barbaric killing methods used by the sealers.</p> <p>The report, produced by the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) and passed to the Guardian, concludes that the 2001 hunt is causing \"considerable and unacceptable suffering\" to the harp seal population of Canada's Atlantic coast.</p> <p>The five eminent vets - two British, two American and one Canadian - who monitored last week's hunt in the Gulf of St Lawrence found that more than 40% of the seals caught were unlikely to have been unconscious, let alone dead, when they were skinned.</p> <p>The Guardian has also learned that the Canadian Veterinary Medicine Association (CVMA), whose support for the hunt has been used by the Canadian government and the sealers in an attempt to persuade the public that it is humane, is considering demanding tougher welfare regulations in the light of the latest evidence of cruelty.</p> <p>The organisation has already contacted Fisheries and Oceans Canada, the government department responsible for regulating the hunt, demanding that it stop citing the CVMA's support in media interviews and on its website.</p> <p>Ian Robinson, one of the two British vets on the panel, said: \"The Canadian government insists that this is an animal production industry like any other. They say that it might not be pretty, but basically it is just like any abattoir except on the ice. But we found obvious levels of suffering which would not be tolerated in any other animal industry in the world.\"</p> <p>Mr Robinson, a Norfolk-based RSPCA vet with 10 years' experience treating large marine mammals, added: \"We accept that the hunt is going to continue and we are not condemning the sealers out of hand. But we want to see tough regulations, enshrined in legislation and enforced, to avoid this suffering.\"</p> <p>According to official records, more than 91,000 harp seals were killed during last year's Canadian hunt, which is the only commercial mammal hunt in the world to take place in spring, at the height of the birthing season. A further 100,000 were caught in the Greenland hunt, which is almost completely unregulated.</p> <p>The killing of newborn seals - those that still have their white fur - is outlawed, but because the animals lose their white coats just 12 days after birth, up to 90% of those caught in the Canadian hunt are between two weeks and one year old.</p> <p>The new evidence is unlikely to lead to the hunt being banned, but opponents hope that it will at least force the Canadian government to act to prevent suffering. Each year, animal welfare charities document instances of cruelty but prosecutions have been rare.</p> <p>The vets carried out postmortem examinations on 76 seal carcasses left behind on the ice after being skinned, and their findings have shocked even the most hardened anti-hunt campaigners.</p> <p>Examinations of the skulls revealed that 17% showed no signs of any cranial injury which would have caused the animal to be unconscious when its pelt was removed. A further 25% showed only minimal or moderate signs of injury which the vets conclude would also have been unlikely to cause unconsciousness.</p> <p>The panel also reviewed video evidence of this year's and previous hunts. It found that in almost 80% of kills recorded, no effort was made by the hunter to check that the seals were unconscious, while in 40% of cases, the hunter left the animal on the ice before returning to club it a second time, suggesting that it was conscious and suffering in the meantime.</p> <p>\"Based on our observations, it is obvious that there is a tremendous lack of consistency in the treatment of each seal, and the existing regulations are neither respected nor enforced,\" the report says.</p> <p><b> Humane killing</b><br></p> <p>In their report, the vets say that there is only one process for ensuring the humane killing of a seal. It must be rendered unconscious with a single blow or shot, the corneal reflex should be checked by poking it in the eyes to ensure that it is unconscious, and the seal should then be bled immediately. This is standard practice in abattoirs.</p> <p>\"Any method for killing a seal which does not allow for the above process of stunning, checking and bleeding to be performed has an enormous potential to create suffering and is therefore unacceptable.\" the report says.</p> <p>It continues: \"As this process cannot be followed in open water, we consider that shooting seals in open water can never be humane. Any method of taking a seal which requires the seal to be recovered by gaffing or hooking before the process can be followed can never be humane.\"</p> <p>Monitors at this year's hunt have documented dozens of examples of cruelty, from seals being hooked and dragged across the ice while still alive for skinning, to others being shot in the water and dragged by hooks on to the ice, with no attempt made to check for unconsciousness.</p> <p>Rick Smith, the Canadian director of IFAW, told the Guardian: \"The most valuable thing about this report is that it puts numbers to the cruelty being suffered. Even after five years monitoring the hunt, the results shocked me.\"</p> <p>Support for the seal hunt among the Canadian public hinges on government claims that it is humane. A government survey last year showed that 54% of citizens were initially opposed to the hunt. But when they were assured that the hunting was carried out humanely, almost 70% voiced support.</p> <p>Fisheries and Oceans Canada last night brushed aside the findings. Ken Jones, resource manager for the Atlantic region, said: \"The findings do not match with our experience at all.</p> <p>\"We have had CVMA vets out on the ice and all the skulls they have found have severe fractures, suggesting a quick death.\"</p> <p>There are clears signs, however, that the CVMA's attitude is changing. Last weekend, the organisation's animal welfare committee met in Toronto to discuss the new report.</p> <p>Bob van Tongerloo, a member of the committee and executive director of the Canadian Federation of Humane Societies, said: \"My understanding is that the CVMA will announce that it is no longer in a position to give its support to the hunt. That decision will be crucial to how the government handles the hunt in future.\"</p> <p><b>Hunting on the up</b></p> <p>\u0095 The official harp seal quota for 2001 is 275,000. Such a quota would leave seal numbers 20,000 short of the level needed to sustain the population, which has led opponents to accuse the Canadian government of sanctioning a cull.</p> <p>\u0095 In 2000, 91,602 harp seals were reported killed in Canada; 93% were less than one year old. Ten hooded seals were killed.</p> <p>\u0095 A harp seal can be legally killed as soon as it has begun to moult its white hair, around 12 days after birth. As a result, roughly 80% of the seals killed in the commercial hunt are 'young of the year' - between approximately 14 days and one year old.</p> <p>\u0095 The annual Greenland catch of harp seals has been increasing in recent years and is now reported to exceed 100,000 animals.</p> <p>\u0095 A recent study in the scientific journal Marine Mammal Science concluded that in 1998 the actual number of harp seals killed was somewhere between 406,258 and 548,903. This compares with the 282,070 animals reported landed by the Canadian government in the same period.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It was once the cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre of animal activists around the world. But for a decade, the annual Canadian seal hunt has managed to continue uninterrupted by claiming a new air of respectability and concern for the welfare of the animals. Now a damning report from an international panel of wildlife vets is set to reignite demands for a crackdown by the Canadian authorities on barbaric killing methods used by the sealers. The report, produced by the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW) and passed to the Guardian, concludes that the 2001 hunt is causing \"considerable and unacceptable suffering\" to the harp seal population of Canada's Atlantic coast. The five eminent vets - two British, two American and one Canadian - who monitored last week's hunt in the Gulf of St Lawrence found that more than 40% of the seals caught were unlikely to have been unconscious, let alone dead, when they were skinned. The Guardian has also learned that the Canadian Veterinary Medicine Association (CVMA), whose support for the hunt has been used by the Canadian government and the sealers in an attempt to persuade the public that it is humane, is considering demanding tougher welfare regulations in the light of the latest evidence of cruelty. The organisation has already contacted Fisheries and Oceans Canada, the government department responsible for regulating the hunt, demanding that it stop citing the CVMA's support in media interviews and on its website. Ian Robinson, one of the two British vets on the panel, said: \"The Canadian government insists that this is an animal production industry like any other. They say that it might not be pretty, but basically it is just like any abattoir except on the ice. But we found obvious levels of suffering which would not be tolerated in any other animal industry in the world.\" Mr Robinson, a Norfolk-based RSPCA vet with 10 years' experience treating large marine mammals, added: \"We accept that the hunt is going to continue and we are not condemning the sealers out of hand. But we want to see tough regulations, enshrined in legislation and enforced, to avoid this suffering.\" According to official records, more than 91,000 harp seals were killed during last year's Canadian hunt, which is the only commercial mammal hunt in the world to take place in spring, at the height of the birthing season. A further 100,000 were caught in the Greenland hunt, which is almost completely unregulated. The killing of newborn seals - those that still have their white fur - is outlawed, but because the animals lose their white coats just 12 days after birth, up to 90% of those caught in the Canadian hunt are between two weeks and one year old. The new evidence is unlikely to lead to the hunt being banned, but opponents hope that it will at least force the Canadian government to act to prevent suffering. Each year, animal welfare charities document instances of cruelty but prosecutions have been rare. The vets carried out postmortem examinations on 76 seal carcasses left behind on the ice after being skinned, and their findings have shocked even the most hardened anti-hunt campaigners. Examinations of the skulls revealed that 17% showed no signs of any cranial injury which would have caused the animal to be unconscious when its pelt was removed. A further 25% showed only minimal or moderate signs of injury which the vets conclude would also have been unlikely to cause unconsciousness. The panel also reviewed video evidence of this year's and previous hunts. It found that in almost 80% of kills recorded, no effort was made by the hunter to check that the seals were unconscious, while in 40% of cases, the hunter left the animal on the ice before returning to club it a second time, suggesting that it was conscious and suffering in the meantime. \"Based on our observations, it is obvious that there is a tremendous lack of consistency in the treatment of each seal, and the existing regulations are neither respected nor enforced,\" the report says. Humane killing In their report, the vets say that there is only one process for ensuring the humane killing of a seal. It must be rendered unconscious with a single blow or shot, the corneal reflex should be checked by poking it in the eyes to ensure that it is unconscious, and the seal should then be bled immediately. This is standard practice in abattoirs. \"Any method for killing a seal which does not allow for the above process of stunning, checking and bleeding to be performed has an enormous potential to create suffering and is therefore unacceptable.\" the report says. It continues: \"As this process cannot be followed in open water, we consider that shooting seals in open water can never be humane. Any method of taking a seal which requires the seal to be recovered by gaffing or hooking before the process can be followed can never be humane.\" Monitors at this year's hunt have documented dozens of examples of cruelty, from seals being hooked and dragged across the ice while still alive for skinning, to others being shot in the water and dragged by hooks on to the ice, with no attempt made to check for unconsciousness. Rick Smith, the Canadian director of IFAW, told the Guardian: \"The most valuable thing about this report is that it puts numbers to the cruelty being suffered. Even after five years monitoring the hunt, the results shocked me.\" Support for the seal hunt among the Canadian public hinges on government claims that it is humane. A government survey last year showed that 54% of citizens were initially opposed to the hunt. But when they were assured that the hunting was carried out humanely, almost 70% voiced support. Fisheries and Oceans Canada last night brushed aside the findings. Ken Jones, resource manager for the Atlantic region, said: \"The findings do not match with our experience at all. \"We have had CVMA vets out on the ice and all the skulls they have found have severe fractures, suggesting a quick death.\" There are clears signs, however, that the CVMA's attitude is changing. Last weekend, the organisation's animal welfare committee met in Toronto to discuss the new report. Bob van Tongerloo, a member of the committee and executive director of the Canadian Federation of Humane Societies, said: \"My understanding is that the CVMA will announce that it is no longer in a position to give its support to the hunt. That decision will be crucial to how the government handles the hunt in future.\" Hunting on the up \u0095 The official harp seal quota for 2001 is 275,000. Such a quota would leave seal numbers 20,000 short of the level needed to sustain the population, which has led opponents to accuse the Canadian government of sanctioning a cull. \u0095 In 2000, 91,602 harp seals were reported killed in Canada; 93% were less than one year old. Ten hooded seals were killed. \u0095 A harp seal can be legally killed as soon as it has begun to moult its white hair, around 12 days after birth. As a result, roughly 80% of the seals killed in the commercial hunt are 'young of the year' - between approximately 14 days and one year old. \u0095 The annual Greenland catch of harp seals has been increasing in recent years and is now reported to exceed 100,000 animals. \u0095 A recent study in the scientific journal Marine Mammal Science concluded that in 1998 the actual number of harp seals killed was somewhere between 406,258 and 548,903. This compares with the 282,070 animals reported landed by the Canadian government in the same period.",

A hitherto unnoticed report in the Commons library warns of serious injuries the bullet could inflict, including a risk of the projectile being \"retained in the head\". The report on the new bullet - the L21A1, to be issued to British police, the RUC, and the army from June 1 - was drawn up by the defence scientific advisory council.

Families of those killed by plastic bullets have condemned the introduction of a new type of baton round. Fourteen people, eight of them children, have been shot dead and hundreds injured in Northern Ireland with the current type of plastic bullet since it was first issued in 1973, as a supposedly safer alternative to the rubber bullet, which has claimed three lives. But critics claim any plastic bullet is a lethal weapon, which should be banned, and that soldiers and police have consistently broken guidelines, firing at people's heads from close by, rather than below the waist from more than 20 metres away. \"Those who have never seen them think they are harmless, like throwing jelly,\" said Clara Reilly, of Belfast-based Relatives for Justice. \"But they're several inches long, rock hard and they come out of a gun at 160 miles an hour. \"They kill and they do horrendous damage. People have been blinded by them, had to have steel plates inserted in their heads. They have caused brain damage, which has altered people's personalities. It's a life sentence for the whole family of those injured.\" Ms Reilly also claimed they had often been used in non-riot situations to intimidate nationalists. Of the 17 people killed by plastic and rubber bullets, 16 were Catholic, one a Protestant. \"We don't want them used on anyone but it is significant they have never been fired during serious riots in England and their use against loyalists at Drumcree has not been as extensive as against nationalists,\" she said. \"They don't stop riots, they start them, such is the anger generated when people are hurt by them. If young nationalists join the new police service, will they be happy training to use plastic bullets, knowing the misery such weapons have caused their in their community? \"There is no accountability whatsoever. Millions have been paid in compensation to the families of those killed and injured by plastic bullets yet not one member of the security forces has ever been convicted of any offence regarding their use. \"The British government has ignored the European parliament's call to ban them. We accept there is sometimes a need for crowd control but there are alternatives, like water cannon, which was effective at Drumcree and during the European football championships.\" Bernadette Devlin's 14-year-old sister, Julie Livingstone, was killed by a plastic bullet in west Belfast in May 1981. \"Twenty years on, after the Good Friday agreement, the Patten report, and all the talk about commitment to human rights, I can't believe instead of abolishing them, they're actually introducing a new kind,\" she said. \"They might as well use live rounds.\" Julie, the youngest of 13 children, was returning home with a friend when soldiers opened fire on a group of women who had gathered to say prayers and bang bin lids after the death of IRA hunger striker Francis Hughes. She was shot in the head and died the next day in hospital. \"Julie was terrified of the police and army,\" said another sister, Elizabeth McCurry. \"She wouldn't have been anywhere near a riot. These soldiers had just driven away from an area where they had been under attack and they were all hyped up, but there was nothing threatening happening where Julie was. \"We still feel aggrieved the soldiers did not even have to attend the inquest to explain what happened. I wonder does the man who shot her ever think about the 14-year-old whose life he took?\" The secretary of state, John Reid, said research into alternatives was under way and he still wanted to eliminate plastic bullet use but it was too soon. \"The government would be delighted if the public order situation improved sufficiently to remove the need to resort to baton rounds at all,\" he said. \"The whole community has a contribution to make to achieve that aim but sadly we are not there yet.\"",

      "body": "<p>The metal gate at the entrance to Anselm Kiefer's 50-acre property outside the Proven\u00e7al town of Barjac bears witness to his desire for privacy. At 55, Kiefer is considered one of the most important artists of his generation, yet he does not court publicity. \"I never wanted to be a star,\" the German artist explains. \"I want to communicate through my work. I never want to have photographs of myself in the press. I am not important. All I want is to do something that goes through me and results in something.\" </p> <p>Over the past 20 years, the artist's immense paintings and sculptural installations, many inspired by his research into German and Jewish memory and myths, have been widely exhibited in Europe and the US. To his satisfaction, a Kiefer painting is now far more recognisable than Kiefer himself. </p> <p>The size of his hilltop property, with its three 19th-century stone buildings, reflects the scale of his works. For his recent acclaimed show in the chapel of the Hpital de la Salpetri\u00e8re in Paris, he did six paintings more than 30ft high. These and other wall-size works fill two cavernous studios and nearby warehouses. Beside a large courtyard, there are stacks of lead sheets, metal bars, terracotta and other material used in his paintings. </p> <p>Now Kiefer is turning his property into a massive installation comprising three lakes as well as numerous buildings connected by tunnels and staircases. The work takes its inspiration from Sefer Hekhaloth, ancient Jewish mystical tracts that describe the search for God at the centre of seven heavenly palaces. \"I do a painting because I am interested in a historical event or its mythological context,\" he said recently. \"But the spectator can have completely different ideas about it. He may have no idea what I mean.\" </p> <p>The risk is that his work is misunderstood, as in the late 1960s, when he was first noticed through a series called Occupations, in which he was photographed giving the Nazi salute in various countries occupied by the Germans during the second world war. Many were funny, suggesting he was satirising the Nazis, but they outraged many Germans. He was even accused of being a neo-Nazi. Kiefer saw it as a way of stirring the buried memories of Germany's recent past. \"When I began my own work in 1968 and 1969, I became aware that the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s were not being addressed in Germany,\" he says. \"I remember that at school we had two or three days for all these 30 years. It was not enough. I had no complete idea of what had happened. Occupations was just a starting point. Then I read a lot.\" </p> <p>His research led him deeper into Goethe, into German philosophy, into the myths that inspired Wagner's opera cycle, Der Ring des Nibelungen. He now had ample motivation for his work, but the intense paintings that followed earned him the reputation in Germany of being a gloomy and melancholic artist. Jewish collectors in the US were the first to understand and buy his work. </p> <p>A more powerful connection to Judaism was established when he visited Israel in 1984. \"I was born into a very Catholic family, so the Judaism in the Bible was very familiar to me,\" he says. \"But it really started when I was in Jerusalem. I was on the Mount of Olives, standing there, looking at the city and the gates, and it struck me that Jesus went through the gates. It was so striking to be there physically, immediately.\" The experience led him to study Jewish mythology and to create an entirely new body of work. </p> <p>Was his attraction to Jewish mysticism also a product of German guilt? \"There is what you call 'German guilt',\" he agrees. \"But there is something else. I cannot imagine German culture without Judaism. Everything that makes German philosophy and poetry interesting to the world is a combination of Germany and Judaism. The Germans committed the immense crime of killing Jews. They also took half of German culture and killed it.\" </p> <p>Kiefer's historical and philosophical baggage is only suggested in his paintings, yet they assume enormous power through both the materials he uses (dried flowers, glass, sand, shards of pottery, string, twigs and, above all, lead) and the images he evokes (clouds, paths, tidal waves, lakes and deserts). From the mid-1980s the titles of his paintings frequently referred to the Old Testament and to Jewish mythology, while his obsession with the written word led him to create large painted books made of lead. </p> <p>Years hence, when the work at his hillside home is completed, he plans to open it to the public and donate it to France. For the moment, though, it is the journey that counts. \"What I like doing are installations,\" he says. \"I am a little bored with painting.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "The metal gate at the entrance to Anselm Kiefer's 50-acre property outside the Proven\u00e7al town of Barjac bears witness to his desire for privacy. At 55, Kiefer is considered one of the most important artists of his generation, yet he does not court publicity. \"I never wanted to be a star,\" the German artist explains. \"I want to communicate through my work. I never want to have photographs of myself in the press. I am not important. All I want is to do something that goes through me and results in something.\" Over the past 20 years, the artist's immense paintings and sculptural installations, many inspired by his research into German and Jewish memory and myths, have been widely exhibited in Europe and the US. To his satisfaction, a Kiefer painting is now far more recognisable than Kiefer himself. The size of his hilltop property, with its three 19th-century stone buildings, reflects the scale of his works. For his recent acclaimed show in the chapel of the Hpital de la Salpetri\u00e8re in Paris, he did six paintings more than 30ft high. These and other wall-size works fill two cavernous studios and nearby warehouses. Beside a large courtyard, there are stacks of lead sheets, metal bars, terracotta and other material used in his paintings. Now Kiefer is turning his property into a massive installation comprising three lakes as well as numerous buildings connected by tunnels and staircases. The work takes its inspiration from Sefer Hekhaloth, ancient Jewish mystical tracts that describe the search for God at the centre of seven heavenly palaces. \"I do a painting because I am interested in a historical event or its mythological context,\" he said recently. \"But the spectator can have completely different ideas about it. He may have no idea what I mean.\" The risk is that his work is misunderstood, as in the late 1960s, when he was first noticed through a series called Occupations, in which he was photographed giving the Nazi salute in various countries occupied by the Germans during the second world war. Many were funny, suggesting he was satirising the Nazis, but they outraged many Germans. He was even accused of being a neo-Nazi. Kiefer saw it as a way of stirring the buried memories of Germany's recent past. \"When I began my own work in 1968 and 1969, I became aware that the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s were not being addressed in Germany,\" he says. \"I remember that at school we had two or three days for all these 30 years. It was not enough. I had no complete idea of what had happened. Occupations was just a starting point. Then I read a lot.\" His research led him deeper into Goethe, into German philosophy, into the myths that inspired Wagner's opera cycle, Der Ring des Nibelungen. He now had ample motivation for his work, but the intense paintings that followed earned him the reputation in Germany of being a gloomy and melancholic artist. Jewish collectors in the US were the first to understand and buy his work. A more powerful connection to Judaism was established when he visited Israel in 1984. \"I was born into a very Catholic family, so the Judaism in the Bible was very familiar to me,\" he says. \"But it really started when I was in Jerusalem. I was on the Mount of Olives, standing there, looking at the city and the gates, and it struck me that Jesus went through the gates. It was so striking to be there physically, immediately.\" The experience led him to study Jewish mythology and to create an entirely new body of work. Was his attraction to Jewish mysticism also a product of German guilt? \"There is what you call 'German guilt',\" he agrees. \"But there is something else. I cannot imagine German culture without Judaism. Everything that makes German philosophy and poetry interesting to the world is a combination of Germany and Judaism. The Germans committed the immense crime of killing Jews. They also took half of German culture and killed it.\" Kiefer's historical and philosophical baggage is only suggested in his paintings, yet they assume enormous power through both the materials he uses (dried flowers, glass, sand, shards of pottery, string, twigs and, above all, lead) and the images he evokes (clouds, paths, tidal waves, lakes and deserts). From the mid-1980s the titles of his paintings frequently referred to the Old Testament and to Jewish mythology, while his obsession with the written word led him to create large painted books made of lead. Years hence, when the work at his hillside home is completed, he plans to open it to the public and donate it to France. For the moment, though, it is the journey that counts. \"What I like doing are installations,\" he says. \"I am a little bored with painting.\"",

      "body": "<p>I was offered a few days on a film, Masada, in California, in which Peter O'Toole was starring as the Roman general. He told me his ideas about Macbeth - the production had been agreed before my recent appointment as temporary director of the Old Vic. Jack Gold was to direct the production. Peter was obviously full of enthusiasm for the project, and so was I. I had perfect confidence in Jack, and left California feeling quite happy about the immediate future. </p> <p>On my return, I was shown the Macbeth contract, which had only just been returned by Peter's lawyers. I was astounded to see that O'Toole had been given total artistic control over the production. This arrangement is a sure recipe for dissent if not disaster. But Peter's lawyers would undoubtedly have come on strong if we tried to back out, and sue us for every penny we patently hadn't got. </p> <p>The first note of doom was struck when Jack Gold came to see me, pleading to be released from his obligation as he had been offered a major film to direct. I set about looking for a replacement. Nobody jumped at the idea of directing a play over which they were effectively to have no control. Also, we had to find a designer. I immediately thought of Bob Crowley, whose work was always imaginative but could well be adapted to the simplified dictates of touring. He produced a model, and came to show it to us. Peter O'Toole had not done any Shakespeare since his Hamlet for the National in 1963, and had not taken into account the way in which Shakespearean stage design had become less descriptive and geared more towards flow and continuity of action. </p> <p>\"If it's a castle, where are the bloody crenellations?\" he would ask. \"If this is Lady Macbeth's bedroom, where is the bed?\" Bob Crowley was turned down. Peter told us that his original conception of the play had involved the use of inflatable scenery. I looked blankly at Mick Wicks, our production manager, and Mick looked at the ceiling. \"Inflatable scenery?\" I ventured. </p> <p>\"Oh yes,\" Peter assured me. \"I am a director of an Irish concern called La Botta Ltd, so named because an entire set, when deflated, can be packed into the boot of a car. I suggest I bring our designer over at my own expense, set him up in a rehearsal room for two weeks to build the set, and after that time we'll have a demonstration on stage. We have also designed a lighting rig using very small but very powerful lamps made of Campbell's soup tins, which can be operated from a transistorised panel on someone's lap, sitting in the stalls.\" </p> <p>If he was having us on, he was keeping an admirably straight face. But the experiment wasn't going to cost us anything, and at the same time we'd quietly continue to pursue more conventional channels. So we said we would give it a try. </p> <p>The Irish designer arrived, and installed himself in rehearsal room B with an enormous pack of black dustbin bags and some tins of adhesive, saying he required nothing from us except a bottle of Power's whiskey to be left outside his door every morning. </p> <p>The promised demonstration was put off, but finally the genius announced that all was ready. Before the curtain rose, our ears were assailed by a noise as if of a gigantic vacuum cleaner operating at full-tilt. I leant over to Peter. \"What' s that noise?\" I asked. </p> <p>\"Air compressor,\" he said shortly. \"We can deal with that.\" </p> <p>The curtain rose to reveal a dimly lit collection of black plastic phalluses swaying in the wind. The general effect was of a blustery day during a refuse collection strike. Into the gloom, from behind one of these erections, emerged a young actor in a black cloak, shouting, above the noise of the compressor: \"Thou Nature art my goddess . . .\" </p> <p>We were just beginning to be aware of the smell of burning oxtail soup, when I stood up and stopped the proceedings. I suggested to Peter that we all meet in my office, and without the bin-bag artist. </p> <p>We sat down in silence; were there going to be excuses, explanation, justification? Not at all. Peter at once began shaking with merriment. \"No, no, it was terrible,\" he gasped, and in relief that, for once, something had happened that we could agree on, we all collapsed into helpless laughter, crying with delight each time anybody remembered some fresh detail of the afternoon's disaster. </p> <p>It was the last happy occasion I shared with Peter. I was not the right partner for him. What he thought he wanted was a complaisant business associate who could laugh with him, make rude jokes about subsidised theatre, join him in a barnstorming assault on an Old Vic audience that hadn't really existed since the time of Lilian Baylis, and miraculously meet all the bills out of the box office. </p> <p>It would be wrong to dismiss these ideas as anachronistic and impractical. There is a lot to be said for the seasoned troupe going round the town halls, schools and local theatres, as the great Anew McMaster used to do in Ireland, delighting the populace with their vigorous accounts of the classics. If that was what Peter really wanted to do, I could have provided him, I think, with a framework in which to do it, and would have welcomed his company back into the Vic when they had finished their tour. But I had a shock when he told me the casting he proposed for such an enterprise. </p> <p>\"Meryl Streep is who I want for Lady Lauder [he pandered to the old theatrical superstition that it was bad luck - ho ho - to quote from this play, and always referred to it as 'Harry Lauder'], and John Gielgud as Duncan.\" He said that if it had been a film, those were the first people he would have approached for the parts. I pointed out that there was a world of difference between appearing in a feature film which would involve them for only a week or two for a considerable fee, and appearing night after night, not only in London but in Liverpool, Bristol, Leeds and Coventry, for a relative pittance. </p> <p>\"Well, they wouldn't have to do the tour,\" he replied. </p> <p>\"But they would, Peter.\" A cold sweat crept over me as I realised he had no idea of how the company worked. \"That's what we're funded for, and the play will be in repertoire with The Merchant of Venice. Obviously I want as many people as possible to be in both plays.\" </p> <p>\"You must fight for your production, I'll fight for mine\" was his reply and he stalked off. </p> <p>In the end we came up with a more sensible list of possible Lady Macbeths, and he showed enthusiasm for Jane Lapotaire. I offered the part to her and she liked the idea. I told Peter the news. \"Jane Lapotaire?\" he retorted. \"Oh, no. I want Frances Tomelty.\" </p> <p>Frances Tomelty was duly engaged and gradually we began to assemble a cast. </p> <p>Over the weeks, Peter had become convinced that myself and the rest of the organisation were out to sabotage his show. He refused to set foot in our office, referring to it as the Gas, Light and Coke Company. </p> <p>We were still without a director or designer. He came up with the unusual suggestion of Bryan Forbes, the film producer and director. I didn't know when Bryan had last directed a play on the stage, but the main thing was that Peter actually got on with him; costume designers, assistant directors and stage management had one by one been sent packing as suspected agents of the Gas, Light and Coke Company and of its supremo, Miss Piggy (me). </p> <p>I was forbidden the theatre during the rehearsal period, but insisted on my right to witness the first dress rehearsal. </p> <p>I was shocked by what I saw. Peter looked as though he could give a perfectly good account of the part, if only he could surrender his own personality to Macbeth's. His verse speaking was quirky but intelligent and often exciting. Brian Blessed roared with laughter and radiated loyal good humour as Banquo, and Frances Tomelty gave her Thane attractive fierceness, but there was no evidence of any thought having been given to the play, and most of the other characters just stood around looking lost. </p> <p>I listed a number of specific problems which it wouldn't take long to sort out. Bryan Forbes agreed with a lot of what I'd suggested, but said he would have to discuss it with Peter. I tried one last time to talk to Peter, but he wouldn't see me. Some form of self-protection was necessary for the company. There was the rest of the season to think of, and the autonomous identity of this one production had to be made clear to the funding bodies, to the touring theatre managers, and to patrons themselves. I therefore put together a brief statement, to be slipped into the theatre programme, saying that this one production was under the direct artistic control of Mr O'Toole, and that further productions in the season, by the Old Vic company, would include The Merchant of Venice. The text was circulated to our board, and to Peter's lawyer, and was approved. </p> <p>The first night came and an eager public crowded into the auditorium; the great, the good, the knockers, the wellwishers, the ordinary public, God help them, the paparazzi. There was an air of real excitement: the opening of the new season, with a new and untried artistic director at the helm, and the first time Peter O'Toole had been on the London stage for 15 years. </p> <p>As I stood dinner-jacketed and suicidal in the foyer, old friends passed me, smiling encouragingly. I managed a sickly return smile and watched, powerless to save the passengers as they pushed their way determinedly up the gangways of the Titanic. </p> <p>The audience were at first bewildered by what they saw, then there were some giggles, and when Peter appeared after the murder drenched in blood from head to foot, there was a burst of laughter. </p> <p>Peter, expert comedian that he is, waited at the top of the stairs for the laughter to subside before exclaiming, \"I have done the deed,\" which brought the house down. From then on, right up to the final moment of the play when a nervous Dudley Sutton, as the victorious Macduff, retreated in terror before the superior swordplay of a Macbeth in modern baseball boots, not much could be taken seriously. I left before the curtain call, went round briefly to thank everyone as they came off stage - I didn't see Peter - and went home in despair. </p> <p>The following morning I was woken at seven o'clock by a phone call from the London Evening Standard.

He might be attempting to find bits of the Amber Room, a bejewelled chamber given by the Prussians to Peter the Great then pinched by the Nazis, or questioning the authenticity of some supposedly prehistoric artefacts found in France. There are few things Aubrey won't do in his pursuit of knowledge. </p> <p>He was on form in <strong> Talking Landscapes</strong> (BBC2). \"What explains the trees?\" he pondered in the first of a series dedicated to the exploration of the British countryside. First stop was the Weald in south-east England, and it wasn't long before he was up to his elbows in mud trying to \"explain\" this fascinating area. He had his own theories, of course, but most of them proved to be wrong. Every time he advanced another, an expert - usually in an anorak - came along and rained on his parade. </p> <p>The Weald has had an eventful history. Cleared by Bronze Age Britons with their little axes, its woods grew back during \"Dark Age confusion\". They were chopped down again for the medieval iron industry and for shipbuilding under Henry VIII.

      "bodyText": "That Aubrey Manning. He's forever scrabbling about in the dirt on the trail of some mystery. He might be attempting to find bits of the Amber Room, a bejewelled chamber given by the Prussians to Peter the Great then pinched by the Nazis, or questioning the authenticity of some supposedly prehistoric artefacts found in France. There are few things Aubrey won't do in his pursuit of knowledge. He was on form in Talking Landscapes (BBC2). \"What explains the trees?\" he pondered in the first of a series dedicated to the exploration of the British countryside. First stop was the Weald in south-east England, and it wasn't long before he was up to his elbows in mud trying to \"explain\" this fascinating area. He had his own theories, of course, but most of them proved to be wrong. Every time he advanced another, an expert - usually in an anorak - came along and rained on his parade. The Weald has had an eventful history. Cleared by Bronze Age Britons with their little axes, its woods grew back during \"Dark Age confusion\". They were chopped down again for the medieval iron industry and for shipbuilding under Henry VIII. The 19th century reprieved the Weald as wooden ships fell out of fashion and the iron industry slowly petered out. As Lewis Grassic Gibbon wrote, nothing endures but the land. In his element - ie, mud - Aubrey clearly relished his role as the minging detective, bringing a genuine enthusiasm to what could be a rather dreary subject.

      "body": "<p>For a quarter of a century, a close friend of mine, a Harvard classmate, has believed that the Central Intelligence Agency murdered his father, a United States government scientist. Believing this means, in my friend's words, \"leaving the known universe\", the one in which it is innocently accepted that an agency of the American government would never do such a thing. My friend has left this known universe, even raising his father's body from the grave where it had lain for 40 years to test the story the CIA told him about the causes of his death. The evidence on the body says that the agency may have lied. But knowing this has not healed my friend. When I ask him what he has learned from his ordeal, he says: \"Never dig up your father.\" Then he laughs, and the look on his face is wild, bitter and full of pain. </p> <p>On November 28 1953, at around 2am, Armand Pastore, night manager at the Statler hotel opposite Penn station in New York, rushed out of the front door on Seventh Avenue to find a middle-aged man lying on the sidewalk in his undershirt and shorts. He was flat on his back, his legs smashed and bent at a terrible angle. \"He was broken up something awful,\" Pastore told reporters years later. Looking up, Pastore could see a blind pushed through an empty window frame high up in the Statler. The man had fallen from the 10th floor - apparently after crashing through a closed window - but he was alive. \"He was trying to mumble something, but I couldn't make it out. It was all garbled, and I was trying to get his name.\" By the time the priest and the ambulance came, the stranger on the sidewalk was dead. </p> <p>When Pastore went up to the stranger's room - 1018A - with the police, they found a man called Robert Lashbrook sitting on the toilet with his head in his hands. Down at reception, Pastore asked the hotel telephone operator whether she had overheard any calls from 1018A. Two, she said. In one, a voice had said: \"He's gone.\" The voice on the other end replied: \"That's too bad.\" Lashbrook admitted making two calls, but has denied saying anything of the sort. </p> <p>The trees over the family house in Frederick, Maryland, were still in darkness when Eric Olson was woken by his mother, Alice. His younger sister, Lisa, and brother, Nils, slept undisturbed. Lt Col Vincent Ruwet, his father's boss at the army research establishment at Fort Detrick, told Eric something bad had happened. \"Fallen or jumped\" and \"accident\" were the words he heard as he looked across the room at his mother, frozen and empty-eyed. \"In that moment when I learned that my father had gone out a window and died,\" Eric later wrote, \"it was as if the plug were pulled from some central basin of my mind and a vital portion of my consciousness drained out.\" He was nine years old. </p> <p>When I first met Eric in 1974, we were both working on doctorates at Harvard: mine in history, his in clinical psychology. What I liked about him was his maniacal cackle. One minute he would be labouring some abstruse point in his southern drawl, the next his face would be alight with a snaggle-toothed grin, electrified by the joke he had just slipped by me, deadpan. The laugh was an attractive and alarming trait, because sometimes he would laugh about things that weren't funny at all. </p> <p>His Harvard research was about how to help people recover from trauma. With the psychiatrist Robert Jay Lifton, he had been to West Virginia to interview survivors of a disaster in which 125 people had been killed when a dam burst and a wall of black water containing coal waste swept down Buffalo Creek. He and Lifton wrote a paper that spoke of the way sudden, violent loss left people imprinted with death anxiety and long-term psychic numbing. </p> <p>I remember Eric talking in his Cambridge apartment about a technique he had been using to help the people of Buffalo Creek. It was called the \"collage method\", and it involved getting survivors to paste together pictures, using anything they felt like clipping out of newspapers and magazines. Eric said that for people whose lives were in pieces anyway, collage was mysteriously satisfying. They would work for hours in silence, he said, moving about the floor, sticking things down, and sometimes when they had finished, they would contemplate what they had done and start to cry. </p> <p>After 75 years of psychoanalysis - the talking cure - here was a therapy that didn't start from words but from images. It seemed to unfurl the winding processes of a person's unconscious and lay them out on paper. Eric had been playing with his father's camera and making photomontages since childhood. But he didn't stumble on the power of collage until he was in his 20s. One night, he and a girlfriend got down on their knees in her apartment and began cutting pictures out of magazines and gluing them down. When Eric finished, the central image of his collage was a grainy picture of a man falling headfirst out of a window. </p> <p>On June 11 1975, the Washington Post revealed that a commission led by Vice-President Nelson Rockefeller had discovered that, \"a civilian employee of the Department of the Army unwittingly took LSD as part of a Central Intelligence Agency test\", and, \"developed serious side effects\". After being sent to New York with a CIA escort for psychiatric treatment, the employee jumped from a hotel window and died. The report added a footnote: \"There are indications in the few remaining agency records that this individual may have had a history of emotional instability.\" </p> <p>Back in Frederick, Lisa Olson confronted Vincent Ruwet. He had regularly visited Alice, shared a drink with her, become a friend of the children. Ruwet stalled at first but eventually confirmed that the man in the story was Frank and that he had known the details in the Post story all along. </p> <p>If Ruwet had known all along, then the family had lived for 22 years in a community of lies: families of government scientists who had kept the truth away from a family dying from the lack of it. This culture of secrecy had also contaminated the family from within. Alice covered the subject of Frank's death with a silence that was both baffling and intimidating. Her mantra, whenever Eric asked about it, was: \"You are never going to know what happened in that room.\" </p> <p>The silence took its toll. By the 60s, Alice Olson was routinely drinking on the quiet, locking herself in the bathroom and then coming out mean and confused. Once, when Eric returned from a year in India, he walked right past her in the airport. The drinking had left her so wasted that he didn't recognise her. All the time, Ruwet had been keeping her company. It later turned out that he had received orders from the CIA's director, Allen Dulles, to keep in touch with her. </p> <p>Thanks to the Post's revelations, the summer of 1975 was the family's \"Copernican Revolution\". They gave the exclusive on their personal story to Seymour Hersh of the New York Times, and when he arrived at their home, his first words were: \"This must be the most uncurious family in the United States. I can't believe you fell for that story for 22 years.\" Later, at a news conference in the backyard at Frederick, the family announced that they were going to sue the government for wrongful death. Their purpose, they said, was to imprint what had happened to their father in \"American memory\". </p> <p>The news conference had immediate results. On July 21 1975, Alice, Eric, Nils, Lisa and her husband Greg were invited to the White House. In the Oval Office, according to newspaper accounts, President Gerald Ford expressed \"the sympathy of the American people and apologised on behalf of the US government\". There is a photograph of Alice shaking the president's hand. Her face is glowing. Even so, catharsis was brief. The meeting lasted 17 minutes. </p> <p>A week or so later, Eric, Lisa, Nils and two lawyers met the CIA's director, William Colby, at the agency's headquarters in Langley, Virginia. In his memoirs, Colby remembered the lunch as \"one of the most difficult assignments I have ever had\". At the end of the lunch, Colby handed the family an inch-thick sheaf of declassified documents relating to Frank Olson's death. What Colby did not tell them - did not reveal until he published his memoirs just three years later - was that Frank Olson had not been a civilian employee of the Department of the Army. He had been a CIA employee working at Fort Detrick. </p> <p>The Colby documents were photocopies of the agency's own in-house investigation of Olson's death, full of unexplained terms such as the \"Artichoke\" and \"Bluebird\" projects. These turned out to be the precursors of what became known as MK-ULTRA, a CIA project, beginning in the Korean war, to explore the use of drugs such as LSD as truth serums, as well as botulism and anthrax, for use in covert assassination. </p> <p>The documents claimed that, during a meeting between the CIA and Fort Detrick scientists at Deep Creek Lodge in Maryland in November 1953, Sidney Gottlieb of the CIA slipped LSD into Olson's Cointreau. After 20 minutes, Olson developed mild symptoms of disorientation. He was then told the drink had been spiked. The next day, Olson returned home early and spent the weekend in a mood that Alice remembered as withdrawn, but not remotely psychotic. He kept saying he had made a terrible mistake, but she couldn't get him to say what it was. </p> <p>On Sunday night, they went to see a film about Martin Luther. It followed the young Luther to the moment of spiritual crisis - \"Here I stand, I can do no other\" - when he decided to take on the might of the Catholic church. The next day, Olson went straight to Ruwet's office and said he wanted to resign. Ruwet told him to calm down. The next morning, he returned to Ruwet's office and insisted his resignation be accepted. While Alice's memory was of Frank being in the grip of an ethical dilemma, Ruwet told CIA investigators that Olson: \"appeared to be greatly agitated and in his own words, 'all mixed up'.\" </p> <p>Ruwet and Robert Lashbrook, a CIA liaison officer at Fort Detrick, took Olson to New York - ostensibly to seek psychiatric advice. But the doctor Olson saw, an allergist named Harold Abramson, was receiving CIA financing to experiment with LSD, and his sole exercise of therapeutic attention was to prescribe Nembutal and bourbon to help Olson sleep. </p> <p>Olson was also taken to see John Mulholland, a New York magician on the CIA payroll, who may have tried to hypnotise him. Ruwet told CIA investigators that in Mulholland's presence, Olson became agitated. \"What's behind this?\" he kept asking his friend Ruwet. \"Give me the lowdown. What are they trying to do with me? Are they checking me for security?\" He told Lashbrook that everyone was in a plot to \"get\" him, and begged them to \"just let me disappear\". </p> <p>According to the documents that Colby had given the family, Olson spent an agonised night wandering the streets of New York, discarding his wallet and identification cards. He said he was too ashamed to go home, so he and Lashbrook ate a cheerless Thanksgiving dinner at a Horn &amp; Hardart automat in midtown. </p> <p>Late the next day, according to the CIA story, it was decided that Olson needed to be institutionalised. Yet when Olson phoned Alice that night, he said that he felt \"much better\" and \"looked forward to seeing her the next day\". That night, in room 1018A, Olson was calm: he washed his socks and underwear and went to sleep. Four hours later, Armand Pastore found him lying on his back on Seventh Avenue. </p> <p>The CIA's general counsel, called in immediately in 1953 to investigate Olson's death, noted that the official story - that LSD \"triggered\" the suicide - was \"inconsistent\" with the facts in the case. Disciplinary action was recommended against Gottlieb and Lashbrook, but the agency's director, Allen Dulles, delivered only a mild reprimand. Lashbrook left the agency, but Gottlieb remained in senior positions for 20 more years. He told the internal inquiry that Olson's death was \"just one of the risks running with scientific experimentation\". Far from ending with Olson's death, the LSD experiments continued for two decades. </p> <p>The Colby documents left the family marooned, no longer believing that Frank's death was suicide but not knowing what to believe instead. In 1976, after negotiations in which they traded away their right to further civil or criminal proceedings against the government, the family received a total of $750,000, half a million less than recommended by the White House and even the CIA itself. </p> <p>If this was \"closure\", it was of an especially cursed kind. Shortly after receiving her portion of the money, Eric's sister, together with her husband and their two-year-old son, Jonathan, set off by small plane from Frederick to the Adirondacks, where they were going to invest the money in a lumber mill. The plane crashed, and everyone on board was killed. </p> <p>In the aftermath of Lisa's death, Eric took his portion of the money and went to Sweden to escape the accursed story. If distance was supposed to heal him, however, the cure didn't work. He \"smouldered\" in Stockholm and in 1984 returned to the States determined, he said, to find out the truth \"once and for all\". </p> <p>\"Once and for all\" meant returning to the hotel and checking into room 1018A. He recalls this strange night as a revelation. \"It just hit you,\" he says. The room was simply too small for his father to have gained the speed to take a running plunge through the window. The sill was too high and too wide - there was a radiator in front of it - for him to have dived through a closed window and a lowered blind in the dark. </p> <p>Eric, Nils and Alice, now recovered from alcoholism, tracked down Sidney Gottlieb to his home in Culpeper, Virginia, where the retired spymaster was raising goats, eating yogurt and preaching the values of peace and environmentalism. He received them pleasantly but conceded nothing. \"I was outclassed,\" Eric remembers. \"This was a world-class intelligence.\" They also found Lashbrook, at his vine-covered stucco house in Ojai, California, where they watched him twitch in his seat as he told his version of what happened - that he was awakened by a crash, saw a broken window and an empty bed and concluded that Frank Olson had jumped to his death. </p> <p>From these encounters, Eric realised that he was up against a brotherhood of silence and that his father had once belonged to it. It was, as one former Detrick employee called it, \"a community of saints\" dedicated to using the most fearful and secret science to defend the republic. </p> <p>Olson's speciality, it turned out, had been the development of aerosols for the delivery of anthrax. With the discovery in the 1950s that the North Koreans were brainwashing US prisoners, the Special Operations Division at Detrick became the centre for the development of drugs for use in brainwashing and interrogation. LSD emerged as one of the interrogation drugs of choice. Alice never knew exactly what her husband was doing - he was, in fact, working for the CIA by this time - but she did know that whenever his lab conducted tests on monkeys and the monkeys died, her husband would bring a testy silence home. </p> <p>One mystery - entry and exit stamps in Frank Olson's passport - indicating that he had been to Sweden, Germany and Britain in the summer of 1953 - seemed to offer a clue to his state of mind in the months before his death. Through Gordon Thomas, a British journalist and author of numerous books on intelligence matters, Eric learned that during a trip to London his father had apparently confided in William Sargant, a consultant psychiatrist who advised British intelligence on brainwashing techniques. </p> <p>According to Thomas, who was a lifelong friend of Sargant's, Olson told Sargant that he had visited secret joint American-British testing and research installations near Frankfurt. Thomas's hypothesis is that the CIA was testing truth serums there - not on monkeys but on human subjects, \"expendables\": captured Russian agents and ex-Nazis. Thomas says that Olson confessed to Sargant that he had witnessed something terrible, possibly \"a terminal experiment\" on one or more of the expendables. Sargant heard Olson out and then reported to British intelligence that the young scientist's misgivings were making him a security risk. He recommended that Olson be denied further access to Porton Down, the chemical-weapons research establishment. </p> <p>A document Eric later saw from his father's personnel file confirmed that doubts had been raised about Olson's security clearance before his death, possibly because of Sargant's warning. Alice, who knew nothing about the nature of his visit, did recall that when he returned from Europe that summer, Frank was unusually withdrawn. </p> <p>Olson, a scientist by training, would have known that he was working for a government that had put Nazi scientists on trial at Nuremberg for immoral experiments on human beings. Now, in the late summer of 1953, his son believes, Olson faced up to the possibility that his own government was doing the same thing. If the CIA was in fact experimenting with \"expendables\" in Germany, and if Olson knew about it, Eric reasoned, then it would not be enough to hospitalise him, discredit him with lies about his mental condition and allow him to slip back into civilian life. It would be better to get rid of him altogether. </p> <p>If Eric is right, slipping LSD into Olson's Cointreau was not an experiment that went wrong: it was designed to get him to talk while hallucinating. The trip to New York was not to contain his incipient psychosis. It was intended to assess what kind of risk he posed and then eliminate him if necessary. Housing a possibly deranged and desperate man in a hotel room high above Seventh Avenue was not a regrettable error of judgment. It was the prelude to murder. If Frank Olson had realised this, his son could now read his father's last words (\"Just let me disappear\") as a cry for help. </p> <p>In 1997, after the CIA inadvertently declassified an assassination manual from late 1953, Eric Olson was able to read the following: \"The most efficient accident, in simple assassination, is a fall of 75 feet or more on to a hard surface. Elevator shafts, stairwells, unscreened windows and bridges will serve. . . The act may be executed by sudden, vigorous [excised] of the ankles, tipping the subject over the edge.\" The manual went on to recommend a blow to the temple to stun the subject first: \"In chase cases it will usually be necessary to stun or drug the subject before dropping him.\" Reading this passage, Eric realised that the word he had been looking for all his life was not \"fallen\" or \"jumped\" but \"dropped\". It was, he recalled, one of the few moments when, after nearly 50 years, he actually experienced his father's death, when the truth he had been seeking finally took hold of him. </p> <p>In allowing the Olson family to receive the ultimate sacrament of American healing - a formal apology from the president in the Oval Office - the CIA tacitly acknowledged that it had committed a sin against the order that holds citizens in allegiance to their government. Now, it seemed to Eric, that apology had been a cynical lie. It enabled the CIA to hide, for ever, a perfect murder. </p> <p>It is one thing to believe a truth as painful as this. It is another to prove it. In 1994, Eric had his father's casket raised from the ground. At the funeral in 1953, the coffin was shut because the family had been told that the body was broken up and that there were extensive lacerations to the face caused by the fall through the glass. In fact, the body had been embalmed, and it was in nearly perfect condition. </p> <p>Eric stared down at a face he had last seen 41 years before. There were no lacerations consistent with damage by glass. On further examination, the forensic team, led by James Starrs of George Washington University, discovered a blow to Olson's temple, on the left side. It could not have occurred, the pathologists agreed, after he went out of the window because the velocity of his descent would have caused more extensive trauma. The conclusion that both Starrs and Eric drew was that someone had knocked Olson out, either while he slept or after a struggle, and then thrown him out of the window. </p> <p>Since the autopsy, Eric has pursued leads to find out who actually carried out \"the wet work\" on his father. HP Albarelli, a writer-researcher with contacts among retired CIA agents in Florida, has found agents who say they know the identity of the men who went into room 1018A that night in November 1953, supposedly to tip Olson through the window. They were not CIA men, they say, but contract killers associated with the Trafficante mob family hired by the CIA. But none of the retired CIA agents, men now in their 70s and 80s, are about to come forward unless they are released from their confidentiality agreements with the agency. </p> <p>In 1996, Olson approached Manhattan's district attorney, Robert Morgenthau, to see if his office would open a new investigation into the case. Stephen Saracco and Daniel Bibb of Morgenthau's \"cold case\" unit have deposed Lashbrook in Ojai; they have followed up a few of the hundreds of leads that Eric besieges them with almost daily. But the Manhattan DA, while probably agreeable to immunity for Albarelli's sources in Florida, has not pursued the confidentiality releases. If you talk to Saracco and Bibb in the Italian restaurant in lower Manhattan where they hang out after hours, you get the impression that they don't think there's a case to send to a grand jury. If you ask them why they don't go to Florida to talk to Albarelli's jealously guarded sources, they look at you as if to say, \"How do you know these people exist?\" </p> <p>If there isn't enough for the Manhattan DA to take to a jury, Eric and his lawyer, Harry Huge, will have to bring a civil suit of their own, claiming that the CIA lied in 1976 when it secured the family's agreement to waive further legal proceedings. Eric says he knows the truth, but it is not the \"smoking gun\" kind of forensic truth that will force the agency to go to court and be put through the discovery process. And if you lack provable truth, you do not get justice. Without justice, there is no accountability, and without accountability there is no healing, no resolution. </p> <p>Last autumn, after nearly 25 years, I went to see Eric in Frederick. The family home, a ranch house, is in a state of suspended animation - seemingly the same carpets, same couches, same dusty jar of Vaseline in the bathroom cabinet that were there the night Frank Olson died. Living there is worst at Thanksgiving, the time of his death. </p> <p>Eric has taken a break from his work on the collage method, and the huge books of patients' collages now lie shut up in storage nearby. The house is full of drafts of books on collage, as well as books about his father's story that remain unfinished because the story itself lacks an ending. Eric lives on foundation grants, book advances and some help from his brother and others. He spends his days hounding journalists, the Manhattan DA, anyone who will listen, with a steady stream of calls and emails from an office just feet away from the same living room, the same chair, the very spot where he was told by Ruwet that his father had \"fallen or jumped\". That he is convinced that the word was neither \"fallen\" nor \"jumped\" but \"dropped\" does not heal. Indeed, his story makes you wonder about that noble phrase \"The truth shall make you free.\" As it happens, that phrase is inscribed in the entry hall of the CIA's headquarters. </p> <p>Eric knows that to charge the most secretive agency of American government with murder is to incur the suspicion that you have become deranged by anger, grief, paranoia, greed or a combination of all four. \"Eric is crazy, Eric is obsessed,\" he says, mimicking his accusers. \"Fine. I agree.\" A maniacal cackle. \"But it's not the point. The point is\" - and here his eyes go flat and cold and relentless - what happened in the damned room.\" </p> <p>Just before I left, we went to the graves of his mother, sister and brother-in-law and their child, the place where he wants his father to be buried. When I asked him when the re-burial will happen, he paused to think. \"When we know what to say,\" he said finally, looking down at the spare piece of grass beside his mother's grave. \"When it is over. When we can do it right.\" </p> <p>It takes me a while after I leave Eric to grasp a fact that may make resolution difficult. For seven years, his father's bones have lain in a filing cabinet in James Starrs's office. Only the bones - and not all of them - remain intact. To get at the truth of what happened to Olson, the pathologists had to rip the skin off his limbs and tear his body apart, macerate it and send it in chunks to various labs for analysis. In the search for truth, Eric had to tear his father's body limb from limb. </p> <p>The fact is, it will never be possible to bury all of Frank Olson again. Now I understand why, when I asked Eric what he had learned from his 25-year ordeal, he told me that no one should ever dig up his father's body. Now I know why my friend's wild laugh is so full of pain. </p> <p><br>\u00a9 Michael Ignatieff.

      "bodyText": "For a quarter of a century, a close friend of mine, a Harvard classmate, has believed that the Central Intelligence Agency murdered his father, a United States government scientist. Believing this means, in my friend's words, \"leaving the known universe\", the one in which it is innocently accepted that an agency of the American government would never do such a thing. My friend has left this known universe, even raising his father's body from the grave where it had lain for 40 years to test the story the CIA told him about the causes of his death. The evidence on the body says that the agency may have lied. But knowing this has not healed my friend. When I ask him what he has learned from his ordeal, he says: \"Never dig up your father.\" Then he laughs, and the look on his face is wild, bitter and full of pain. On November 28 1953, at around 2am, Armand Pastore, night manager at the Statler hotel opposite Penn station in New York, rushed out of the front door on Seventh Avenue to find a middle-aged man lying on the sidewalk in his undershirt and shorts. He was flat on his back, his legs smashed and bent at a terrible angle. \"He was broken up something awful,\" Pastore told reporters years later. Looking up, Pastore could see a blind pushed through an empty window frame high up in the Statler. The man had fallen from the 10th floor - apparently after crashing through a closed window - but he was alive. \"He was trying to mumble something, but I couldn't make it out. It was all garbled, and I was trying to get his name.\" By the time the priest and the ambulance came, the stranger on the sidewalk was dead. When Pastore went up to the stranger's room - 1018A - with the police, they found a man called Robert Lashbrook sitting on the toilet with his head in his hands. Down at reception, Pastore asked the hotel telephone operator whether she had overheard any calls from 1018A. Two, she said. In one, a voice had said: \"He's gone.\" The voice on the other end replied: \"That's too bad.\" Lashbrook admitted making two calls, but has denied saying anything of the sort. The trees over the family house in Frederick, Maryland, were still in darkness when Eric Olson was woken by his mother, Alice. His younger sister, Lisa, and brother, Nils, slept undisturbed. Lt Col Vincent Ruwet, his father's boss at the army research establishment at Fort Detrick, told Eric something bad had happened. \"Fallen or jumped\" and \"accident\" were the words he heard as he looked across the room at his mother, frozen and empty-eyed. \"In that moment when I learned that my father had gone out a window and died,\" Eric later wrote, \"it was as if the plug were pulled from some central basin of my mind and a vital portion of my consciousness drained out.\" He was nine years old. When I first met Eric in 1974, we were both working on doctorates at Harvard: mine in history, his in clinical psychology. What I liked about him was his maniacal cackle. One minute he would be labouring some abstruse point in his southern drawl, the next his face would be alight with a snaggle-toothed grin, electrified by the joke he had just slipped by me, deadpan. The laugh was an attractive and alarming trait, because sometimes he would laugh about things that weren't funny at all. His Harvard research was about how to help people recover from trauma. With the psychiatrist Robert Jay Lifton, he had been to West Virginia to interview survivors of a disaster in which 125 people had been killed when a dam burst and a wall of black water containing coal waste swept down Buffalo Creek. He and Lifton wrote a paper that spoke of the way sudden, violent loss left people imprinted with death anxiety and long-term psychic numbing. I remember Eric talking in his Cambridge apartment about a technique he had been using to help the people of Buffalo Creek. It was called the \"collage method\", and it involved getting survivors to paste together pictures, using anything they felt like clipping out of newspapers and magazines. Eric said that for people whose lives were in pieces anyway, collage was mysteriously satisfying. They would work for hours in silence, he said, moving about the floor, sticking things down, and sometimes when they had finished, they would contemplate what they had done and start to cry. After 75 years of psychoanalysis - the talking cure - here was a therapy that didn't start from words but from images. It seemed to unfurl the winding processes of a person's unconscious and lay them out on paper. Eric had been playing with his father's camera and making photomontages since childhood. But he didn't stumble on the power of collage until he was in his 20s. One night, he and a girlfriend got down on their knees in her apartment and began cutting pictures out of magazines and gluing them down. When Eric finished, the central image of his collage was a grainy picture of a man falling headfirst out of a window. On June 11 1975, the Washington Post revealed that a commission led by Vice-President Nelson Rockefeller had discovered that, \"a civilian employee of the Department of the Army unwittingly took LSD as part of a Central Intelligence Agency test\", and, \"developed serious side effects\". After being sent to New York with a CIA escort for psychiatric treatment, the employee jumped from a hotel window and died. The report added a footnote: \"There are indications in the few remaining agency records that this individual may have had a history of emotional instability.\" Back in Frederick, Lisa Olson confronted Vincent Ruwet. He had regularly visited Alice, shared a drink with her, become a friend of the children. Ruwet stalled at first but eventually confirmed that the man in the story was Frank and that he had known the details in the Post story all along. If Ruwet had known all along, then the family had lived for 22 years in a community of lies: families of government scientists who had kept the truth away from a family dying from the lack of it. This culture of secrecy had also contaminated the family from within. Alice covered the subject of Frank's death with a silence that was both baffling and intimidating. Her mantra, whenever Eric asked about it, was: \"You are never going to know what happened in that room.\" The silence took its toll. By the 60s, Alice Olson was routinely drinking on the quiet, locking herself in the bathroom and then coming out mean and confused. Once, when Eric returned from a year in India, he walked right past her in the airport. The drinking had left her so wasted that he didn't recognise her. All the time, Ruwet had been keeping her company. It later turned out that he had received orders from the CIA's director, Allen Dulles, to keep in touch with her. Thanks to the Post's revelations, the summer of 1975 was the family's \"Copernican Revolution\". They gave the exclusive on their personal story to Seymour Hersh of the New York Times, and when he arrived at their home, his first words were: \"This must be the most uncurious family in the United States. I can't believe you fell for that story for 22 years.\" Later, at a news conference in the backyard at Frederick, the family announced that they were going to sue the government for wrongful death. Their purpose, they said, was to imprint what had happened to their father in \"American memory\". The news conference had immediate results. On July 21 1975, Alice, Eric, Nils, Lisa and her husband Greg were invited to the White House. In the Oval Office, according to newspaper accounts, President Gerald Ford expressed \"the sympathy of the American people and apologised on behalf of the US government\". There is a photograph of Alice shaking the president's hand. Her face is glowing. Even so, catharsis was brief. The meeting lasted 17 minutes. A week or so later, Eric, Lisa, Nils and two lawyers met the CIA's director, William Colby, at the agency's headquarters in Langley, Virginia. In his memoirs, Colby remembered the lunch as \"one of the most difficult assignments I have ever had\". At the end of the lunch, Colby handed the family an inch-thick sheaf of declassified documents relating to Frank Olson's death. What Colby did not tell them - did not reveal until he published his memoirs just three years later - was that Frank Olson had not been a civilian employee of the Department of the Army. He had been a CIA employee working at Fort Detrick. The Colby documents were photocopies of the agency's own in-house investigation of Olson's death, full of unexplained terms such as the \"Artichoke\" and \"Bluebird\" projects. These turned out to be the precursors of what became known as MK-ULTRA, a CIA project, beginning in the Korean war, to explore the use of drugs such as LSD as truth serums, as well as botulism and anthrax, for use in covert assassination. The documents claimed that, during a meeting between the CIA and Fort Detrick scientists at Deep Creek Lodge in Maryland in November 1953, Sidney Gottlieb of the CIA slipped LSD into Olson's Cointreau. After 20 minutes, Olson developed mild symptoms of disorientation. He was then told the drink had been spiked. The next day, Olson returned home early and spent the weekend in a mood that Alice remembered as withdrawn, but not remotely psychotic. He kept saying he had made a terrible mistake, but she couldn't get him to say what it was. On Sunday night, they went to see a film about Martin Luther. It followed the young Luther to the moment of spiritual crisis - \"Here I stand, I can do no other\" - when he decided to take on the might of the Catholic church. The next day, Olson went straight to Ruwet's office and said he wanted to resign. Ruwet told him to calm down. The next morning, he returned to Ruwet's office and insisted his resignation be accepted. While Alice's memory was of Frank being in the grip of an ethical dilemma, Ruwet told CIA investigators that Olson: \"appeared to be greatly agitated and in his own words, 'all mixed up'.\" Ruwet and Robert Lashbrook, a CIA liaison officer at Fort Detrick, took Olson to New York - ostensibly to seek psychiatric advice. But the doctor Olson saw, an allergist named Harold Abramson, was receiving CIA financing to experiment with LSD, and his sole exercise of therapeutic attention was to prescribe Nembutal and bourbon to help Olson sleep. Olson was also taken to see John Mulholland, a New York magician on the CIA payroll, who may have tried to hypnotise him. Ruwet told CIA investigators that in Mulholland's presence, Olson became agitated. \"What's behind this?\" he kept asking his friend Ruwet. \"Give me the lowdown. What are they trying to do with me? Are they checking me for security?\" He told Lashbrook that everyone was in a plot to \"get\" him, and begged them to \"just let me disappear\". According to the documents that Colby had given the family, Olson spent an agonised night wandering the streets of New York, discarding his wallet and identification cards. He said he was too ashamed to go home, so he and Lashbrook ate a cheerless Thanksgiving dinner at a Horn &amp; Hardart automat in midtown. Late the next day, according to the CIA story, it was decided that Olson needed to be institutionalised. Yet when Olson phoned Alice that night, he said that he felt \"much better\" and \"looked forward to seeing her the next day\". That night, in room 1018A, Olson was calm: he washed his socks and underwear and went to sleep. Four hours later, Armand Pastore found him lying on his back on Seventh Avenue. The CIA's general counsel, called in immediately in 1953 to investigate Olson's death, noted that the official story - that LSD \"triggered\" the suicide - was \"inconsistent\" with the facts in the case. Disciplinary action was recommended against Gottlieb and Lashbrook, but the agency's director, Allen Dulles, delivered only a mild reprimand. Lashbrook left the agency, but Gottlieb remained in senior positions for 20 more years. He told the internal inquiry that Olson's death was \"just one of the risks running with scientific experimentation\". Far from ending with Olson's death, the LSD experiments continued for two decades. The Colby documents left the family marooned, no longer believing that Frank's death was suicide but not knowing what to believe instead. In 1976, after negotiations in which they traded away their right to further civil or criminal proceedings against the government, the family received a total of $750,000, half a million less than recommended by the White House and even the CIA itself. If this was \"closure\", it was of an especially cursed kind. Shortly after receiving her portion of the money, Eric's sister, together with her husband and their two-year-old son, Jonathan, set off by small plane from Frederick to the Adirondacks, where they were going to invest the money in a lumber mill. The plane crashed, and everyone on board was killed. In the aftermath of Lisa's death, Eric took his portion of the money and went to Sweden to escape the accursed story. If distance was supposed to heal him, however, the cure didn't work. He \"smouldered\" in Stockholm and in 1984 returned to the States determined, he said, to find out the truth \"once and for all\". \"Once and for all\" meant returning to the hotel and checking into room 1018A. He recalls this strange night as a revelation. \"It just hit you,\" he says. The room was simply too small for his father to have gained the speed to take a running plunge through the window. The sill was too high and too wide - there was a radiator in front of it - for him to have dived through a closed window and a lowered blind in the dark. Eric, Nils and Alice, now recovered from alcoholism, tracked down Sidney Gottlieb to his home in Culpeper, Virginia, where the retired spymaster was raising goats, eating yogurt and preaching the values of peace and environmentalism. He received them pleasantly but conceded nothing. \"I was outclassed,\" Eric remembers. \"This was a world-class intelligence.\" They also found Lashbrook, at his vine-covered stucco house in Ojai, California, where they watched him twitch in his seat as he told his version of what happened - that he was awakened by a crash, saw a broken window and an empty bed and concluded that Frank Olson had jumped to his death. From these encounters, Eric realised that he was up against a brotherhood of silence and that his father had once belonged to it. It was, as one former Detrick employee called it, \"a community of saints\" dedicated to using the most fearful and secret science to defend the republic. Olson's speciality, it turned out, had been the development of aerosols for the delivery of anthrax. With the discovery in the 1950s that the North Koreans were brainwashing US prisoners, the Special Operations Division at Detrick became the centre for the development of drugs for use in brainwashing and interrogation. LSD emerged as one of the interrogation drugs of choice. Alice never knew exactly what her husband was doing - he was, in fact, working for the CIA by this time - but she did know that whenever his lab conducted tests on monkeys and the monkeys died, her husband would bring a testy silence home. One mystery - entry and exit stamps in Frank Olson's passport - indicating that he had been to Sweden, Germany and Britain in the summer of 1953 - seemed to offer a clue to his state of mind in the months before his death. Through Gordon Thomas, a British journalist and author of numerous books on intelligence matters, Eric learned that during a trip to London his father had apparently confided in William Sargant, a consultant psychiatrist who advised British intelligence on brainwashing techniques. According to Thomas, who was a lifelong friend of Sargant's, Olson told Sargant that he had visited secret joint American-British testing and research installations near Frankfurt. Thomas's hypothesis is that the CIA was testing truth serums there - not on monkeys but on human subjects, \"expendables\": captured Russian agents and ex-Nazis. Thomas says that Olson confessed to Sargant that he had witnessed something terrible, possibly \"a terminal experiment\" on one or more of the expendables. Sargant heard Olson out and then reported to British intelligence that the young scientist's misgivings were making him a security risk. He recommended that Olson be denied further access to Porton Down, the chemical-weapons research establishment. A document Eric later saw from his father's personnel file confirmed that doubts had been raised about Olson's security clearance before his death, possibly because of Sargant's warning. Alice, who knew nothing about the nature of his visit, did recall that when he returned from Europe that summer, Frank was unusually withdrawn. Olson, a scientist by training, would have known that he was working for a government that had put Nazi scientists on trial at Nuremberg for immoral experiments on human beings. Now, in the late summer of 1953, his son believes, Olson faced up to the possibility that his own government was doing the same thing. If the CIA was in fact experimenting with \"expendables\" in Germany, and if Olson knew about it, Eric reasoned, then it would not be enough to hospitalise him, discredit him with lies about his mental condition and allow him to slip back into civilian life. It would be better to get rid of him altogether. If Eric is right, slipping LSD into Olson's Cointreau was not an experiment that went wrong: it was designed to get him to talk while hallucinating. The trip to New York was not to contain his incipient psychosis. It was intended to assess what kind of risk he posed and then eliminate him if necessary. Housing a possibly deranged and desperate man in a hotel room high above Seventh Avenue was not a regrettable error of judgment. It was the prelude to murder. If Frank Olson had realised this, his son could now read his father's last words (\"Just let me disappear\") as a cry for help. In 1997, after the CIA inadvertently declassified an assassination manual from late 1953, Eric Olson was able to read the following: \"The most efficient accident, in simple assassination, is a fall of 75 feet or more on to a hard surface. Elevator shafts, stairwells, unscreened windows and bridges will serve. . . The act may be executed by sudden, vigorous [excised] of the ankles, tipping the subject over the edge.\" The manual went on to recommend a blow to the temple to stun the subject first: \"In chase cases it will usually be necessary to stun or drug the subject before dropping him.\" Reading this passage, Eric realised that the word he had been looking for all his life was not \"fallen\" or \"jumped\" but \"dropped\". It was, he recalled, one of the few moments when, after nearly 50 years, he actually experienced his father's death, when the truth he had been seeking finally took hold of him. In allowing the Olson family to receive the ultimate sacrament of American healing - a formal apology from the president in the Oval Office - the CIA tacitly acknowledged that it had committed a sin against the order that holds citizens in allegiance to their government. Now, it seemed to Eric, that apology had been a cynical lie. It enabled the CIA to hide, for ever, a perfect murder. It is one thing to believe a truth as painful as this. It is another to prove it. In 1994, Eric had his father's casket raised from the ground. At the funeral in 1953, the coffin was shut because the family had been told that the body was broken up and that there were extensive lacerations to the face caused by the fall through the glass. In fact, the body had been embalmed, and it was in nearly perfect condition. Eric stared down at a face he had last seen 41 years before. There were no lacerations consistent with damage by glass. On further examination, the forensic team, led by James Starrs of George Washington University, discovered a blow to Olson's temple, on the left side. It could not have occurred, the pathologists agreed, after he went out of the window because the velocity of his descent would have caused more extensive trauma. The conclusion that both Starrs and Eric drew was that someone had knocked Olson out, either while he slept or after a struggle, and then thrown him out of the window. Since the autopsy, Eric has pursued leads to find out who actually carried out \"the wet work\" on his father. HP Albarelli, a writer-researcher with contacts among retired CIA agents in Florida, has found agents who say they know the identity of the men who went into room 1018A that night in November 1953, supposedly to tip Olson through the window. They were not CIA men, they say, but contract killers associated with the Trafficante mob family hired by the CIA. But none of the retired CIA agents, men now in their 70s and 80s, are about to come forward unless they are released from their confidentiality agreements with the agency. In 1996, Olson approached Manhattan's district attorney, Robert Morgenthau, to see if his office would open a new investigation into the case. Stephen Saracco and Daniel Bibb of Morgenthau's \"cold case\" unit have deposed Lashbrook in Ojai; they have followed up a few of the hundreds of leads that Eric besieges them with almost daily. But the Manhattan DA, while probably agreeable to immunity for Albarelli's sources in Florida, has not pursued the confidentiality releases. If you talk to Saracco and Bibb in the Italian restaurant in lower Manhattan where they hang out after hours, you get the impression that they don't think there's a case to send to a grand jury. If you ask them why they don't go to Florida to talk to Albarelli's jealously guarded sources, they look at you as if to say, \"How do you know these people exist?\" If there isn't enough for the Manhattan DA to take to a jury, Eric and his lawyer, Harry Huge, will have to bring a civil suit of their own, claiming that the CIA lied in 1976 when it secured the family's agreement to waive further legal proceedings. Eric says he knows the truth, but it is not the \"smoking gun\" kind of forensic truth that will force the agency to go to court and be put through the discovery process. And if you lack provable truth, you do not get justice. Without justice, there is no accountability, and without accountability there is no healing, no resolution. Last autumn, after nearly 25 years, I went to see Eric in Frederick. The family home, a ranch house, is in a state of suspended animation - seemingly the same carpets, same couches, same dusty jar of Vaseline in the bathroom cabinet that were there the night Frank Olson died. Living there is worst at Thanksgiving, the time of his death. Eric has taken a break from his work on the collage method, and the huge books of patients' collages now lie shut up in storage nearby. The house is full of drafts of books on collage, as well as books about his father's story that remain unfinished because the story itself lacks an ending. Eric lives on foundation grants, book advances and some help from his brother and others. He spends his days hounding journalists, the Manhattan DA, anyone who will listen, with a steady stream of calls and emails from an office just feet away from the same living room, the same chair, the very spot where he was told by Ruwet that his father had \"fallen or jumped\". That he is convinced that the word was neither \"fallen\" nor \"jumped\" but \"dropped\" does not heal. Indeed, his story makes you wonder about that noble phrase \"The truth shall make you free.\" As it happens, that phrase is inscribed in the entry hall of the CIA's headquarters. Eric knows that to charge the most secretive agency of American government with murder is to incur the suspicion that you have become deranged by anger, grief, paranoia, greed or a combination of all four. \"Eric is crazy, Eric is obsessed,\" he says, mimicking his accusers. \"Fine. I agree.\" A maniacal cackle. \"But it's not the point. The point is\" - and here his eyes go flat and cold and relentless - what happened in the damned room.\" Just before I left, we went to the graves of his mother, sister and brother-in-law and their child, the place where he wants his father to be buried. When I asked him when the re-burial will happen, he paused to think. \"When we know what to say,\" he said finally, looking down at the spare piece of grass beside his mother's grave. \"When it is over. When we can do it right.\" It takes me a while after I leave Eric to grasp a fact that may make resolution difficult. For seven years, his father's bones have lain in a filing cabinet in James Starrs's office. Only the bones - and not all of them - remain intact. To get at the truth of what happened to Olson, the pathologists had to rip the skin off his limbs and tear his body apart, macerate it and send it in chunks to various labs for analysis. In the search for truth, Eric had to tear his father's body limb from limb. The fact is, it will never be possible to bury all of Frank Olson again. Now I understand why, when I asked Eric what he had learned from his 25-year ordeal, he told me that no one should ever dig up his father's body. Now I know why my friend's wild laugh is so full of pain. \u00a9 Michael Ignatieff.

      "body": "<p>Flash back to April 1951. The first issue of a new film journal, Les Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma, appears on French newsstands. It's a small-format magazine with a yellow-rimmed cover framing a black and white photograph of Gloria Swanson in Sunset Boulevard. There is a feature on American director Edward Dmytrck, a long review of Robert Bresson's Diary of a Country Priest and a short tribute to Jean-George Auriol, the editor of La Revue du Cin\u00e9ma, who had died in a car crash the year before. Nothing about the publication seems especially incendiary. There is little hint that Cahiers - which celebrates its 50th anniversary this month - will go on to develop into probably the most influential and contentious film magazine in cinema history. </p> <p>It was in Cahiers' pages that Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut published his famous broadside against the old guard, A Certain Tendency in French Cinema; that the idea of auteurism (\"la politique des auteurs\") was first articulated; that future film-makers Jean-Luc Godard, Claude Chabrol, Jacques Rivette and Eric Rohmer polemicised and proselytised on behalf of the directors they revered; that the renowned critic Andr\u00e9 Bazin (1918-1958) published many of his articles about mise-en-sc\u00e8ne and depth of focus. \"One had immense admiration for Bazin, who was an intellectual powerhouse, and for the Cahiers critics,\" remembers former Sight and Sound editor Penelope Houston. \"There was a general feeling in England that we weren't living up to them. We probably weren't.\" </p> <p>It is hard now to appreciate the sheer passion for cinema that the magazine engendered. Every night, the Cahiers critics and their acolytes would attend screenings at Henri Langlois's Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que. \"Films would be flung into the programme without any thought, but that was the theory - that all films deserved to be seen and your judgments should not be shaped for you in advance by hierarchies imposed on the programme,\" recalls British writer Gilbert Adair, a Cahiers subscriber since he was 16. Cahiers reviewers only wrote about films they admired, and when they wrote, they wrote at length: to devote 25 pages to, say, the work of Otto Preminger was considered commonplace. </p> <p>In the postwar era, the magazine responded in ecstatic fashion to movies that British critics (then championing documentaries and neo-realism in publications such as Sight and Sound and The Penguin Film Review) regarded as ersatz and meretricious. That partially explains why, in the UK, the initial response to the new magazine combined awe with bewilderment and a large dose of mockery. </p> <p>\"I think a lot of Cahiers' peculiar tastes were because they didn't speak English,\" recalls Houston, voicing a familiar criticism. \"Their passion for American cinema was based on not understanding the dialogue.\" Whether or not there is a kernel of truth in this, it is widely accepted that Cahiers, as Sight and Sound's current editor Nick James puts it, \"broke the ground in treating film-makers who had made popular films as artists\". </p> <p>Houston remembers that the French magazine held British pictures in very low regard. \"They thought the whole English cinema was artificial and theatrical and that we didn't get the hang of what Hitchcock would have called 'pure cinema'. They had this wonderful way of calling British films 'films from the studios of Her Majesty', as if the Queen was somehow behind it all. I think they thought nothing of British cinema, but we didn't either very much.\" </p> <p>Cahiers critics wrote about cinema with a wild flamboyance. Their pronouncements sometimes teetered on the brink of absurdity. Bazin once likened analysing westerns to wine-tasting - a comparison that one doubts would have appealed to either Howard Hawks or John Wayne. (\"The wine-lover alone can discern the body and the bouquet, the alcohol content and the fruitiness, and all these nuances intermingled, where the uninitiated can only make a rough guess at whether it is a Burgundy or a Bordeaux,\" Bazin wrote before long asides about The Naked Spur and The Man from Laramie.) </p> <p>Godard insisted tracking shots were \"a question of morality\". The magazine's reverence for Hitchcock verged on idolatry. Some of its enthusiasms - notably for Jerry Lewis (\"le Roi du Crazy\") - baffled outsiders. Its appetite for hyperbole often laid it open to ridicule. You can dig out nuggets wherever you look: \"Fuller is to Welles as Marlowe is to Shakespeare\" (Luc Moullet). \"You can describe Hiroshima Mon Amour as Faulkner plus Stravinsky\" (Godard). </p> <p>Inevitably, Cahiers changed over the years. In the 1950s it had championed the work of \"old masters\" such as Hitchcock, Sternberg and Lang. In the early 1960s it heralded new waves, in France and elsewhere. Then, post-1968, it went into its sternest political phase, eventually embracing Maoism. \"The magazine became so politicised that you could buy an issue and there would not be a single photograph of a single film or even a single title cited,\" Adair remembers. \"You could get an image of a Botticelli painting or a page of a score from Schoenberg, but you wouldn't actually get a photograph of a film.\" </p> <p>For Cahiers' critics, film-going became a furtive activity. They were so preoccupied with politics that they did not dare write about the movies they saw. Circulation plummeted and British readers grew even more baffled. Cahiers is now owned by Le Monde, printed on glossy paper, looks a little like Premiere, and tends to have portraits of stars on the cover. Editorial chief Frank Nouchi insists that, despite the commercial compromises made to guarantee the magazine's future, the original spirit and passion still remain. \"There is a continuing line which starts with Bazin and Truffaut and carries on today,\" he states. </p> <p> Others are not so bullish about the new-look magazine. \"It's crap,\" Gilbert Adair sighs. \"I buy it today because it's just too much part of my life . It's like supporting a football team.\" Adair concedes, however, that the cinema has changed: it is hard to maintain a passionate, polemical magazine when there are so few new movies to get excited about. </p> <p>Penelope Houston too feels that the magazine's influence is on the wane. Cahiers, she says, changed the way that an entire generation of British critics thought about cinema.

      "bodyText": "Flash back to April 1951. The first issue of a new film journal, Les Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma, appears on French newsstands. It's a small-format magazine with a yellow-rimmed cover framing a black and white photograph of Gloria Swanson in Sunset Boulevard. There is a feature on American director Edward Dmytrck, a long review of Robert Bresson's Diary of a Country Priest and a short tribute to Jean-George Auriol, the editor of La Revue du Cin\u00e9ma, who had died in a car crash the year before. Nothing about the publication seems especially incendiary. There is little hint that Cahiers - which celebrates its 50th anniversary this month - will go on to develop into probably the most influential and contentious film magazine in cinema history. It was in Cahiers' pages that Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut published his famous broadside against the old guard, A Certain Tendency in French Cinema; that the idea of auteurism (\"la politique des auteurs\") was first articulated; that future film-makers Jean-Luc Godard, Claude Chabrol, Jacques Rivette and Eric Rohmer polemicised and proselytised on behalf of the directors they revered; that the renowned critic Andr\u00e9 Bazin (1918-1958) published many of his articles about mise-en-sc\u00e8ne and depth of focus. \"One had immense admiration for Bazin, who was an intellectual powerhouse, and for the Cahiers critics,\" remembers former Sight and Sound editor Penelope Houston. \"There was a general feeling in England that we weren't living up to them. We probably weren't.\" It is hard now to appreciate the sheer passion for cinema that the magazine engendered. Every night, the Cahiers critics and their acolytes would attend screenings at Henri Langlois's Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que. \"Films would be flung into the programme without any thought, but that was the theory - that all films deserved to be seen and your judgments should not be shaped for you in advance by hierarchies imposed on the programme,\" recalls British writer Gilbert Adair, a Cahiers subscriber since he was 16. Cahiers reviewers only wrote about films they admired, and when they wrote, they wrote at length: to devote 25 pages to, say, the work of Otto Preminger was considered commonplace. In the postwar era, the magazine responded in ecstatic fashion to movies that British critics (then championing documentaries and neo-realism in publications such as Sight and Sound and The Penguin Film Review) regarded as ersatz and meretricious. That partially explains why, in the UK, the initial response to the new magazine combined awe with bewilderment and a large dose of mockery. \"I think a lot of Cahiers' peculiar tastes were because they didn't speak English,\" recalls Houston, voicing a familiar criticism. \"Their passion for American cinema was based on not understanding the dialogue.\" Whether or not there is a kernel of truth in this, it is widely accepted that Cahiers, as Sight and Sound's current editor Nick James puts it, \"broke the ground in treating film-makers who had made popular films as artists\". Houston remembers that the French magazine held British pictures in very low regard. \"They thought the whole English cinema was artificial and theatrical and that we didn't get the hang of what Hitchcock would have called 'pure cinema'. They had this wonderful way of calling British films 'films from the studios of Her Majesty', as if the Queen was somehow behind it all. I think they thought nothing of British cinema, but we didn't either very much.\" Cahiers critics wrote about cinema with a wild flamboyance. Their pronouncements sometimes teetered on the brink of absurdity. Bazin once likened analysing westerns to wine-tasting - a comparison that one doubts would have appealed to either Howard Hawks or John Wayne. (\"The wine-lover alone can discern the body and the bouquet, the alcohol content and the fruitiness, and all these nuances intermingled, where the uninitiated can only make a rough guess at whether it is a Burgundy or a Bordeaux,\" Bazin wrote before long asides about The Naked Spur and The Man from Laramie.) Godard insisted tracking shots were \"a question of morality\". The magazine's reverence for Hitchcock verged on idolatry. Some of its enthusiasms - notably for Jerry Lewis (\"le Roi du Crazy\") - baffled outsiders. Its appetite for hyperbole often laid it open to ridicule. You can dig out nuggets wherever you look: \"Fuller is to Welles as Marlowe is to Shakespeare\" (Luc Moullet). \"You can describe Hiroshima Mon Amour as Faulkner plus Stravinsky\" (Godard). Inevitably, Cahiers changed over the years. In the 1950s it had championed the work of \"old masters\" such as Hitchcock, Sternberg and Lang. In the early 1960s it heralded new waves, in France and elsewhere. Then, post-1968, it went into its sternest political phase, eventually embracing Maoism. \"The magazine became so politicised that you could buy an issue and there would not be a single photograph of a single film or even a single title cited,\" Adair remembers. \"You could get an image of a Botticelli painting or a page of a score from Schoenberg, but you wouldn't actually get a photograph of a film.\" For Cahiers' critics, film-going became a furtive activity. They were so preoccupied with politics that they did not dare write about the movies they saw. Circulation plummeted and British readers grew even more baffled. Cahiers is now owned by Le Monde, printed on glossy paper, looks a little like Premiere, and tends to have portraits of stars on the cover. Editorial chief Frank Nouchi insists that, despite the commercial compromises made to guarantee the magazine's future, the original spirit and passion still remain. \"There is a continuing line which starts with Bazin and Truffaut and carries on today,\" he states. Others are not so bullish about the new-look magazine. \"It's crap,\" Gilbert Adair sighs. \"I buy it today because it's just too much part of my life . It's like supporting a football team.\" Adair concedes, however, that the cinema has changed: it is hard to maintain a passionate, polemical magazine when there are so few new movies to get excited about. Penelope Houston too feels that the magazine's influence is on the wane. Cahiers, she says, changed the way that an entire generation of British critics thought about cinema. The quality of film reviewing, she believes, has gone downhill since the 1960s, when Cahiers' influence was at its strongest: nowadays critics pay little attention to filmic language, but write about movies as they would about novels or plays. The films themselves don't help. \"I wouldn't go into film criticism now if you offered me the top job on a plate,\" says Houston. \"It is so boring. Who wants to spend their days looking at special effects movies from Hollywood made for 15-year-olds?\"",

The spas became a wonderful institution in the centuries before modern medicine, not just because their waters and treatments helped combat the costive diet and Biedermeier excess of their patrons, but because they were centres of culture. Carlsbad, strung like pearls along the winding banks of the Tepla in a fold of Bohemia's wooded hills, boasts the oldest orchestra in Europe. Beethoven and Goethe were regular visitors there, to sip the ambiguously tasting product of the springs and to bathe in them.

The spas became a wonderful institution in the centuries before modern medicine, not just because their waters and treatments helped combat the costive diet and Biedermeier excess of their patrons, but because they were centres of culture. Carlsbad, strung like pearls along the winding banks of the Tepla in a fold of Bohemia's wooded hills, boasts the oldest orchestra in Europe. Beethoven and Goethe were regular visitors there, to sip the ambiguously tasting product of the springs and to bathe in them. At one end of the valley stands a magnificent hostelry, the Grandhotel Pupp, a palace of a bygone age of splendour and repose. As an alternative to Lent, 40 days at the Pupp is much preferable, the purgations it offers anything but purgatorial. It is hard to imagine how the Russian novel could have got along without German spas, since so many of them seem to have been written in places like Baden Baden and Marienbad. Turgenev wandered from one to another, thinking about fathers, sons and first love, and Dostoevsky struggled to purge his gambling addiction in them. One virtue of fasting in the Islamic view is that it teaches us how the poor and hungry feel. That is a good discipline. Perhaps \"the cleannesse of sweet abstinence\", as George Herbert put it, is as medicinal to the moral sense as it is to the body. If so, it is the real reason why it makes us better.",

Sir Nigel Wicks said he wanted whoever is prime minister after the election - almost certainly Mr Blair - to rewrite the ministerial code of conduct and to ensure that he takes responsibility for deciding ministerial fates, rather than leaving it to the advice of the cabinet secretary. Mr Blair has already created a precedent by rapidly dispensing with Peter Mandelson in February, in contrast to earlier dithering by himself and John Major over the likes of Neil Hamilton, Jonathan Aitken, Geoffrey Robinson, and Mr Mandelson during the 1998 home loan scandal. In a public signal to both Whitehall and Westminster, Sir Nigel, who succeeded Lord Neil as chairman last month, told MPs that they should also raise their game by appointing more senior MPs to their own committee of standards and privileges - and by making a senior opposition figure its chairman. Though the reform has been floated before, its renewal at the end of a bruising series of rows within the committee comes close to suggesting that the Labour majority has sometimes pulled its punches - which MPs involved hotly deny. Some are urgently seeking a pre-election Commons debate to air their views. Sir Nigel also proposed that the parliamentary commissioner for standards, now Elizabeth Filkin, should be given greater powers \"to obtain information when investigating cases\" but also suggested that she does not to take too long over her inquiries - an oblique reference to Mrs Filkin's protracted battle with Keith Vaz, the minister for Europe. Formerly a Treasury official famous for his discretion, Sir Nigel named no names when he set out his stall to journalists yesterday after meeting his fellow-commissioners for the first time this week. But high profile cases like those involving Mr Hamilton, Mr Vaz and Conservative Tony Baldry - who recommended a client for an honour - have clearly been exercising his mind, along with other cases where MPs have been hit by relatively trivial \"tit-for-tat\" allegations organised by rival political parties or by newspapers. For the most serious cases, Sir Nigel reminded MPs of previous, and still-unimplemented, proposals and said that \"there should be procedures to ensure minimum standards of fairness\" without resort to the courts - which MPs are determined to avoid. The suggestion was an indirect response to ex-MP Mr Hamilton's complaint that he had not been given a proper chance to defend himself when Sir Gordon Downey was standards watchdog at Westminster. Sir Nigel said that ways should be found to prevent \"complaints which look to be trivial and are essentially for scoring points\". Ken Livingstone, John Major, William Hague and others have been caught out for not registering activities involving their work as MPs in the register of members' interests.

Stones, too, was brought up in County Durham, winning a scholarship to Alderman Wraith grammar school, Spennymoor, which he left after passing O-levels. One of his first jobs was in Winterton hospital, Sedgefield. He then worked for a number of pharmaceutical companies, before becoming a consultant. As a scientist, he specialised in the crop ailments of potatoes, and particularly in their growth by tissue culture. He leaves his wife, a daughter and two sons. David Ward writes When I first met Tom Stones at the end of a beautiful day in May 1997, he sat under a tree in his garden, read from the transcript of Will's court martial, and his last letters, written on tissue-thin paper. \"That's all that's left of the poor little bugger,\" he said, and went into the house, close to tears. We met for the last time last autumn, when Tom was eager to explain that the families would join the main Remembrance Day parade. He sensed a clear shift in official opinion. He never managed to persuade ministers to grant pardons to the executed soldiers, but he was convinced the time would come. He was a fine and remarkable man. \u0095 Thomas Winston Stones, scientist and campaigner, born September 7 1940; died March 27 2001.",

You wouldn't think of letting them spoil your day, and when they've been dealt with, you think no more of them. But that itching and that droning do have a way of insinuating themselves in one's gorgeous life, and then they need seeing to. I've been only vaguely aware of a character called \"Hunter Davies\" over the past few decades. I remember a radio run-in with the lovely 80s pop star Marilyn, during which he tried to humiliate the tempestuous pouting beauty; \"What sort of name is Marilyn for a man?\" he squeaked. There was a pause. </p> <p>\"I don't know,\" admitted Marilyn in his surprisingly deep 'n' hunky voice. \"What sort of name is Hunter?\"</p> <p>Oooo! Then there was a book of essays I reviewed for the Spectator, which left me with the burden of knowledge that Mr Davies has a writing style that makes Charles Pooter look like Nabokov. Photographs shudderingly glimpsed over the years have informed us that Mr Davies has been, for some time, in receipt of the very same moustache that Peter Mandelson shaved off because it made him look \"too camp\". (Too right.) And then, for as long as I can remember, butch old Hunter had been taking joyless little pops at me - obviously one of the legions of sad-sack, pay-your-dues-laddie penny-a-liners who never really forgave moi for the fact that, by the age of 25, I was on \u00a3125k a year and eating out with (I said with) the cutest commissioning editor gals in Fleet Street, while they'd had to make it t'hard way by spending a decade on provincial papers only to fetch up to a swift half in The Stab In The Back. </p> <p>So it did my hard little heart good to see that the great man's latest effort, a book called The Quarrymen, is a thoroughly and pleasingly rancid example of My Dead Beatle Syndrome, wherein invariably male, always middle-aged hacks, who usually make a great show of loathing the modern, trashy, meretricious world, and who would spit from a great height on kiss-and-tell girls, suddenly come over all red misty, and when they wake up there's a sizeable book, or at least a 2,000-word article on what great mates they were with Johnny-Boy and what he said to them that wet weekend in Bootle in 1964. And by succumbing to this automatic spirit-writing business on a regular basis, they end up making almost as comfy a living off Lennon's corpse as his widow does. </p> <p>Davies' book, the first excerpt of which ran in a Sunday paper under the headline MY FRIEND JOHN, revealed that the Whining One called his fans \"fucking maniacs\", that he was phobic about physical contact even with family and close friends, disliked the company of women, his wife and son to a pathological degree, was pathetically jealous and resentful of Paul McCartney and considered himself seriously to be a reincarnation of Jesus Christ, to the extent that he actually called an Apple board meeting to formally announce the fact to the other Beatles (\"They looked rather stunned, but said nothing\"). The actual \"friend\" of the title is Lennon's boyhood chum Pete Shotton, who spilled these rather rank beans to Davies, but you'd be forgiven for making the mistake, seeing as how Hunter has exploited the Beatles connection for the past 30-odd years. </p> <p>In a way, the book could be deemed to be a success, in that I now know a number of things about John Lennon I never knew before. On the other hand, my new knowledge is wholly negative. And this is one \"friend\" of Lennon's talking to another \"friend\" - both of whom, I'd bet money, got their frillies well into a twist when Albert Goldman published his definitive Lennon biography in the 80s. Yet Goldman made it clear that he righteously loathed Lennon both as a man and as a musician; he did not steal up under the cover of friendship and drive a knife between his shoulder blades. How much more preferable is the honest whore of a glamour model who gives the foolish footballer one of the best nights of his life and then seeks a little redress for her troubles from the kind editor of a small Sunday paper, to the \"friend\" who waits until the buddy is cold in their grave and then sells nasty secrets to a large Sunday paper, the dry-humping of commerce lubricated by the slime of sentiment! </p> <p>It does make you think that celebrities are right only to go about with other famous people on the grounds that you've both taken a hostage to fortune. In the same Sunday paper, the girlfriend of Shane MacGowan went through her party-piece one more time; how she is \"The Invisible Woman\" who \"thought that having celebrity friends would make her appear more glamourous\", but \"couldn't have been more wrong\". A few months ago, this preposterous woman actually wrote a piece about being treated in the Priory for - get this - addiction to famous friends! (Mind you, \"fame\" is a moveable feast these days; hilariously, Nasty Nick Bateman said that he hadn't gone on Big Brother in order to find fame, as he already knew famous people such as Andrew Neil and Buster Bloodvessel, and they were just like you and me. No!) </p> <p>It's hard to get the balance right here; if famous people go about together, they look pathetically insecure, as though they can't believe they've had a good time until they see the pictures in OK! magazine proving it, but if they team up with a punter (a far more accurate comparison than Liz Hurley's \"civilian\", celebrities having far more in common with prostitutes than they do with soldiers), there's every chance that money may change hands if there are tears before bedtime. Whatever option, at the end of the day I can't help feeling that people, especially women, place too much emphasis on friendship; friendship surely doesn't increase, but decrease, us, with all those people waltzing around with bits of us! </p> <p>I was interested to see recently that Sharon Maguire, best friend of Helen Fielding and director of the Bridget Jones film, now confesses herself to be extremely happy with the \"lovely boyfriend\" who, in the Fielding novel, is held up to be the prime example of \"emotional fuckwittage\" that supposedly characterises the male gender. I wonder if it's a coincidence that her best friend Helen now lives a safe distance away in LA - and that I last read about her scolding a hotel maid for throwing out the stuffed rabbit toy who had become her \"companion\" during a \"bored, lonely\" promotional tour. Friendship is all well and good - but it does all too often resemble a three-legged race, in which the slower partner attempts to bring the quicker one down to their speed. And surely, that's not a very caring sort of thing to do . . .</p>",

      "body": "<p>The funny thing about seasons is that they are, well, seasonal.</p> <p>You often find yourself hankering for the one at the opposite pole of the calendar. We've all had quaint and misty visions of tea and toast around the log fire in the middle of July, or of hearing the gentle knock of leather against willow while waiting for a train in the freezing January rain (which will not be appearing before February, anyway). So it is with cooking.</p> <p>Chefs are just desperate to get their artichoke-stained hands on the new season's vegetables.</p> <p>I like spring vegetables, but blink and you miss them. When they start arriving in late April and early May, we use them in just about everything at Chez Bruce: starters, mains, meat, fish and fowl. I would make a dessert from baby carrots and broad beans if I was more technically gifted.</p> <p>The blanquette recipe (right) uses young veg to nice effect. You can, of course, use more or less than in the recipe, or different vegetables altogether. But please do cook them with sympathetic understanding - they are only little blighters, after all. It is useful to cook them beforehand (by blanching in salted boiling water and refreshing in an icy bath to retain colour) because being small, they can be thrown in the sauce at the last minute without fear of death by drowning.</p> <p>Talking of drowning, will there ever be an end to all this rain? I've just about had it with spring showers.</p> <p>All recipes serve four.</p> <p><b>Petit pot de Provence with radishes </b></p> <p>Apologies for the pretentious name: I simply can think of no other. Proven\u008dal flavours are combined here in a neat take on old-fashioned egg mayonnaise. The radishes provide a refreshingly crunchy foil to the richness of the tapenade, and the dish makes an elegant start to a spring or early summer dinner. Serve in a shallow (preferably glass) ramekin, so that each spoonful contains all the elements. These flavours are all fairly robust and well seasoned, so try to adhere to the principle that a little goes a long way.</p> <p>For the egg mayonnaise</p> <p><b> 2 hard-boiled eggs, chopped </b><br> <b> 1 heaped tsp mayonnaise </b><br></p> <p>For the tapenade</p> <p><b> 24 large black olives </b><br> <b> 1 clove garlic, minced </b><br> <b> 4 anchovy fillets </b><br> <b> 1 dssp capers, chopped </b></p> <p>For the sauce vi\u008frge</p> <p><b> 3 ripe plum tomatoes </b><br> <b> 1 shallot, minced </b><br> <b> 1 clove garlic, minced </b><br> <b> 6 fresh basil leaves </b><br> <b> Extra-virgin oil (preferably Proven\u008dale)</b></p> <p>To serve</p> <p><b> 24 radishes </b><br> <b> Sea salt </b></p> <p>First, make the egg mayo: blend the chopped hard-boiled eggs with just enough mayonnaise to make a thick egg pur\u008ee, then season generously. Next, make the tapenade: blend the olives, garlic, capers, anchovy fillets and enough olive oil to emulsify the mixture, then season - it is important that the tapenade is quite thick and not too oily. Finally, prepare the sauce vi\u008frge: first, make a tomato concasse by blanching, peeling, coring and deseeding the tomatoes, then cutting their flesh into a very fine dice. Mix this with the shallot, garlic, oil and basil, and season - again, it must not be too oily.</p> <p>Now, construct the dish. Layer first the sauce vi\u008frge, then the tapenade and finally the egg mayo in the ramekins, and pop in the fridge until ready to serve. Serve with a bowl of chilled radishes, sea salt and some good crusty bread or toast.</p> <p><b> Blanquette of chicken with spring vegetables and morels </b></p> <p>A classic blanquette is a \u00d4white' braise - that is, the meat is not browned before cooking in a light stock or water, and the sauce is not thickened by excessive reductions but by the addition of an egg yolk or two. This can be a problem, as the yolk can curdle if you are not careful, and I find the yolk is not necessary anyway if circumspect reduction is combined with the right amount of cream. A light hand is required to achieve a beautifully rich and silky sauce that contains a fair whack of cholesterol but is not in any way cloying.</p> <p>Use the best free-range chicken you can afford - cheap birds will lend nothing to the stock or to the finished dish. If you end up with a pale caramel hue to your sauce, you'll have succeeded only in getting Escoffier to spin in his grave.</p> <p>For the stock</p> <p><b> 4 free-range chicken legs (plus the carcasses, if you have them)</b><br> <b> half a tbsp butter </b><br> <b> 2 leeks </b><br> <b> 2 carrots </b><br> <b> 1 onion </b><br> <b> half a head celery </b><br> <b> 4 bayleaves </b><br> <b> 1 big bunch thyme </b><br> <b> whole head garlic </b><br> <b> 1 glass dry white wine (Riesling, say)</b><br> <b> Light chicken stock or water </b></p> <p>For the blanquette</p> <p><b> 12 baby carrots </b><br> <b> 12 baby leeks </b><br> <b> 24 fine green beans </b><br> <b> 1 handful flat-leaf parsley, chopped </b><br> <b> 560ml double cream </b><br> <b> 1 handful fresh morels (my hands are big)</b><br> <b> Butter </b></p> <p>Season the chicken pieces, then seal them in a knob of melted butter in a frying pan without colouring the meat. Remove the chicken from the pan and deglaze with the wine. When the alcohol has all but evaporated, add the stock vegetables and herbs, sealed chicken and cover with light chicken stock or water.

      "bodyText": "The funny thing about seasons is that they are, well, seasonal. You often find yourself hankering for the one at the opposite pole of the calendar. We've all had quaint and misty visions of tea and toast around the log fire in the middle of July, or of hearing the gentle knock of leather against willow while waiting for a train in the freezing January rain (which will not be appearing before February, anyway). So it is with cooking. Chefs are just desperate to get their artichoke-stained hands on the new season's vegetables. I like spring vegetables, but blink and you miss them. When they start arriving in late April and early May, we use them in just about everything at Chez Bruce: starters, mains, meat, fish and fowl. I would make a dessert from baby carrots and broad beans if I was more technically gifted. The blanquette recipe (right) uses young veg to nice effect. You can, of course, use more or less than in the recipe, or different vegetables altogether. But please do cook them with sympathetic understanding - they are only little blighters, after all. It is useful to cook them beforehand (by blanching in salted boiling water and refreshing in an icy bath to retain colour) because being small, they can be thrown in the sauce at the last minute without fear of death by drowning. Talking of drowning, will there ever be an end to all this rain? I've just about had it with spring showers. All recipes serve four. Petit pot de Provence with radishes Apologies for the pretentious name: I simply can think of no other. Proven\u008dal flavours are combined here in a neat take on old-fashioned egg mayonnaise. The radishes provide a refreshingly crunchy foil to the richness of the tapenade, and the dish makes an elegant start to a spring or early summer dinner. Serve in a shallow (preferably glass) ramekin, so that each spoonful contains all the elements. These flavours are all fairly robust and well seasoned, so try to adhere to the principle that a little goes a long way. For the egg mayonnaise 2 hard-boiled eggs, chopped 1 heaped tsp mayonnaise For the tapenade 24 large black olives 1 clove garlic, minced 4 anchovy fillets 1 dssp capers, chopped For the sauce vi\u008frge 3 ripe plum tomatoes 1 shallot, minced 1 clove garlic, minced 6 fresh basil leaves Extra-virgin oil (preferably Proven\u008dale) To serve 24 radishes Sea salt First, make the egg mayo: blend the chopped hard-boiled eggs with just enough mayonnaise to make a thick egg pur\u008ee, then season generously. Next, make the tapenade: blend the olives, garlic, capers, anchovy fillets and enough olive oil to emulsify the mixture, then season - it is important that the tapenade is quite thick and not too oily. Finally, prepare the sauce vi\u008frge: first, make a tomato concasse by blanching, peeling, coring and deseeding the tomatoes, then cutting their flesh into a very fine dice. Mix this with the shallot, garlic, oil and basil, and season - again, it must not be too oily. Now, construct the dish. Layer first the sauce vi\u008frge, then the tapenade and finally the egg mayo in the ramekins, and pop in the fridge until ready to serve. Serve with a bowl of chilled radishes, sea salt and some good crusty bread or toast. Blanquette of chicken with spring vegetables and morels A classic blanquette is a \u00d4white' braise - that is, the meat is not browned before cooking in a light stock or water, and the sauce is not thickened by excessive reductions but by the addition of an egg yolk or two. This can be a problem, as the yolk can curdle if you are not careful, and I find the yolk is not necessary anyway if circumspect reduction is combined with the right amount of cream. A light hand is required to achieve a beautifully rich and silky sauce that contains a fair whack of cholesterol but is not in any way cloying. Use the best free-range chicken you can afford - cheap birds will lend nothing to the stock or to the finished dish. If you end up with a pale caramel hue to your sauce, you'll have succeeded only in getting Escoffier to spin in his grave. For the stock 4 free-range chicken legs (plus the carcasses, if you have them) half a tbsp butter 2 leeks 2 carrots 1 onion half a head celery 4 bayleaves 1 big bunch thyme whole head garlic 1 glass dry white wine (Riesling, say) Light chicken stock or water For the blanquette 12 baby carrots 12 baby leeks 24 fine green beans 1 handful flat-leaf parsley, chopped 560ml double cream 1 handful fresh morels (my hands are big) Butter Season the chicken pieces, then seal them in a knob of melted butter in a frying pan without colouring the meat. Remove the chicken from the pan and deglaze with the wine. When the alcohol has all but evaporated, add the stock vegetables and herbs, sealed chicken and cover with light chicken stock or water. Bring up to a gentle simmer, skim off any impurities from the surface and cook for an hour. Blanch and refresh the carrots, leeks and beans. To make the sauce, take a biggish ladle of stock, strain it, pour into a pan and reduce by half. Then add four times its volume of cream, and reduce by half again. Cook the morels in a little butter and water, and reheat them with the vegetables quickly in the sauce, adjusting for seasoning and adding the parsley. Serve the chicken with the sauced vegetables in deep bowls (I like to keep the skin on, but some folk are queasy about it) with some buttered noodles or boiled new potatoes. Rich but light chocolate cake All too often, chocolate cakes are either seriously chocolatey yet heavy and stodgy, or light as a feather and devoid of any of the luxury associated with the star ingredient. Not so this recipe. By combining the egg whites and sugar, you get a wicked texture somewhere between sponge and mousse. The better the chocolate, the better (and more bitter) the flavour. Serves four, with the added bonus of plenty being left over for coffee the next day. 250g dark chocolate (I always use Valrhona) 100g unsalted butter 3 whole eggs, separated, plus 2 extra whites 100g caster sugar 25g flour Line the base of a 25cm sandwich tin with greaseproof paper. Melt the chocolate and butter in a bowl over a bain-marie or in a microwave. Stir in the egg yolks (which should not be fridge cold) and sift in the flour. Whisk all the whites at full blast, then add the sugar in three stages until you have a stiff, glossy meringue.

      "body": "<p>Pull open the glass door, feel the rush of cool air, walk in, get in line, study the backlit colour photographs above the counter, place your order, hand over a few dollars. Watch teenagers in uniforms pushing various buttons, and moments later take hold of a plastic tray full of food wrapped in coloured paper and cardboard. The whole experience of buying fast food has become so routine, so thoroughly unexceptional and mundane, that it is now taken for granted, like brushing your teeth or stopping for a red light. It has become a social custom as American as a small, rectangular, hand-held, frozen and reheated apple pie.</p> <p>Over the past three decades, an industry that began with a handful of hot dog and hamburger stands in southern California has spread to almost every corner of the globe. Fast food is now served at restaurants, stadiums, airports, zoos, schools and universities, on cruise ships, trains and aeroplanes, at supermarkets, petrol stations and even in hospital cafeterias. Americans now spend more money on fast food - $110bn last year - than they do on higher education. They spend more on fast food than on movies, books, magazines, newspapers, videos and recorded music - combined.</p> <p>What people eat (or don't eat) has always been determined by a complex interplay of social, economic and technological forces. The early Roman Republic was fed by its citizen-farmers; the Roman Empire, by its slaves. During a relatively brief period of time, the fast food industry has helped transform not only our diet, but also the landscape, economy, workforce and popular culture. Fast food and its consequences have become inescapable, regardless of whether you eat it twice a day or have never taken a single bite. In some cases (such as the malling and sprawling of the west), the fast food industry has been a catalyst and a symptom of larger economic trends. In other cases (such as the rise of franchising and the spread of obesity), fast food has played a central role.</p> <p>Hundreds of millions of people buy fast food every day without giving it much thought, unaware of the subtle and not so subtle ramifications of their purchases. They rarely consider where this food came from, how it was made, what it is doing to the community around them. I think people should know what lies behind the shiny, happy surface of every fast food transaction. They should know what really lurks between those sesame-seed buns. As the old saying goes: You are what you eat.</p> <p>During my research for the book, I ate an enormous amount of fast food. Most of it tasted pretty good. That is one of the main reasons people buy fast food; it has been carefully designed to taste good. The taste of McDonald's French fries, for example, has long been praised by customers, competitors and even food critics. James Beard, the legendary American gourmet, loved McDonald's fries. Their distinctive taste does not stem from the type of potatoes that McDonald's buys, the technology that processes them, or the restaurant equipment that fries them. Other chains buy their French fries from the same large processing companies, use Russet Burbanks and have similar fryers in their restaurant kitchens. The taste of a fast-food fry is largely determined by the cooking oil. For decades, McDonald's cooked its French fries in a mixture of about 7% cottonseed oil and 93% beef tallow. The mix gave the fries their unique flavour - and more saturated beef fat per ounce than a McDonald's hamburger.</p> <p>Amid a barrage of criticism over the amount of cholesterol in its fries, McDonald's switched to pure vegetable oil in 1990. The switch presented the company with an enormous challenge: how to make fries that subtly taste like beef without cooking them in tallow. A look at the ingredients now used in the preparation of McDonald's French fries suggests how the problem was solved. At the end of the list is a seemingly innocuous yet oddly mysterious phrase: \"natural flavour\". That ingredient helps to explain not only why the fries taste so good, but also why most fast food - indeed, most of the food Americans eat today - tastes the way it does.</p> <p>Open your refrigerator, your freezer, your kitchen cupboards, and look at the labels on your food. You'll find \"natural flavour\" or \"artificial flavour\" in just about every list of ingredients. The similarities between these two broad categories are far more significant than their differences. Both are man-made additives that give most processed food its taste. The initial purchase of a food item may be driven by its packaging or appearance, but subsequent purchases are determined mainly by its taste. About 90% of the money that Americans spend on food is used to buy processed food. But the canning, freezing and dehydrating techniques used to process food destroy much of its flavour. Since the end of the second world war, a vast industry has arisen in the US to make processed food palatable. The names of the leading fast-food chains and their bestselling menu items have become famous worldwide, embedded in our popular culture. Few people, however, can name the companies that manufacture fast food's taste.</p> <p>The flavour industry is highly secretive. Its leading companies will not divulge the precise formulas of flavour compounds or the identities of clients. The secrecy is deemed essential for protecting the reputation of beloved brands. The fast-food chains, understandably, would like the public to believe that the flavours of their food somehow originate in their restaurant kitchens, not in distant factories run by other firms.</p> <p>The New Jersey Turnpike runs through the heart of the flavour industry, an industrial corridor dotted with refineries and chemical plants. International Flavours and Fragrances (IFF), the world's largest flavour company, has a manufacturing facility in Dayton, New Jersey. The plant is a huge, pale blue building with a modern office complex attached to the front. It sits in an industrial park, not far from a BASF plastics factory, a Jolly French Toast factory and a plant that manufactures Liz Claiborne cosmetics.</p> <p>Dozens of tractor-trailers were parked at the IFF loading dock the afternoon I visited, and a thin cloud of steam floated from a roof vent. Before entering the plant, I signed a non-disclosure form, promising not to reveal the brand names of products that contain IFF flavours. The place reminded me of Willy Wonka's chocolate factory. Wonderful smells drifted through the hallways, men and women in neat, white lab coats cheerfully went about their work, and hundreds of little glass bottles sat on laboratory tables and shelves. The bottles contained powerful and fragile flavour chemicals, shielded from light by the brown glass and round plastic caps shut tight. The long chemical names on the little white labels were as mystifying to me as medieval Latin. They were the odd-sounding names of things that would be mixed and poured and turned into new substances, like magic potions.</p> <p>I was not invited to see the manufacturing areas of the IFF plant, where it was thought I might discover trade secrets. Instead, I toured various laboratories and pilot kitchens, where the flavours of well-established brands are tested or adjusted, and where whole new flavours are created. IFF's snack and savoury lab is responsible for the flavour of crisps, corn chips, breads, crackers, breakfast cereals and pet food. The confectionery lab devises the flavour for ice cream, biscuits, sweets, toothpastes, mouthwashes and antacids. Everywhere I looked, I saw famous, widely-advertised products sitting on laboratory desks and tables. The beverage lab is full of brightly coloured liquids in clear bottles. It comes up with the flavour for popular soft drinks, sport drinks, bottled teas and wine coolers, for all-natural juice drinks, organic soy drinks, beers and malt liquors.</p> <p>In one pilot kitchen I saw a dapper food technologist, a middle-aged man with an elegant tie beneath his lab coat, carefully preparing a batch of biscuits with white frosting and pink-and-white sprinkles. In another pilot kitchen I saw a pizza oven, a grill, a milk-shake machine, and a French fryer identical to those I'd seen behind the counter at countless fast-food restaurants.</p> <p>In addition to being the world's largest flavour company, IFF manufactures the smell of six of the 10 bestselling perfumes in the US, including Est*e Lauder's Beautiful, Clinique's Happy, Lanc\u00aame's Tr*sor and Calvin Klein's Eternity. It also makes the smell of household products such as deodorant, dishwashing detergent, bath soap, shampoo, furniture polish and floor wax. All of these aromas are made through the same basic process: the manipulation of volatile chemicals to create a particular smell. The basic science behind the scent of your shaving cream is the same as that governing the flavour of your TV dinner.</p> <p>Scientists now believe that human beings acquired the sense of taste as a way to avoid being poisoned. Edible plants generally taste sweet; deadly ones, bitter. Taste is supposed to help us differentiate food that's good for us from food that's not. The tastebuds on our tongues can detect the presence of half a dozen or so basic tastes, including: sweet, sour, bitter, salty, astringent and umami (a taste discovered by Japanese researchers, a rich and full sense of deliciousness triggered by amino acids in foods such as shellfish, mushrooms, potatoes and seaweed). Tastebuds offer a limited means of detection, however, compared with the human olfactory system, which can perceive thousands of different chemical aromas. Indeed, \"flavour\" is primarily the smell of gases being released by the chemicals you've just put in your mouth. The aroma of food can be responsible for as much as 90% of its flavour.</p> <p>The act of drinking, sucking or chewing a substance releases its volatile gases. They flow out of the mouth and up the nostrils, or up the passageway at the back of the mouth, to a thin layer of nerve cells called the olfactory epithelium, located at the base of the nose, right between the eyes. The brain combines the complex smell signals from the epithelium with the simple taste signals from the tongue, assigns a flavour to what's in your mouth, and decides if it's something you want to eat.</p> <p>Babies like sweet tastes and reject bitter ones; we know this because scientists have rubbed various flavours inside the mouths of infants and then recorded their facial reactions. A person's food preferences, like his or her personality, are formed during the first few years of life, through a process of socialisation. Toddlers can learn to enjoy hot and spicy food, bland health food, or fast food, depending upon what the people around them eat. The human sense of smell is still not fully understood. It is greatly affected by psychological factors and expectations. The mind filters out the overwhelming majority of chemical aromas that surround us, focusing intently on some, ignoring others. People can grow accustomed to bad smells or good smells; they stop noticing what once seemed overpowering. </p> <p>Aroma and memory are somehow inextricably linked. A smell can suddenly evoke a long-forgotten moment. The flavours of childhood foods seem to leave an indelible mark, and adults often return to them, without always knowing why. These \"comfort foods\" become a source of pleasure and reassurance, a fact that fast-food chains work hard to promote. Childhood memories of Happy Meals can translate into frequent adult visits to McDonald's, like those of the chain's \"heavy users\", the customers who eat there four or five times a week.</p> <p>The human craving for flavour has been a largely unacknowledged and unexamined force in history. Royal empires have been built, unexplored lands have been traversed, great religions and philosophies have been forever changed by the spice trade. In 1492, Christopher Columbus set sail to find seasoning. Today, the influence of flavour in the world marketplace is no less decisive. The rise and fall of corporate empires - of soft-drink companies, snack-food companies and fast-food chains - is frequently determined by how their products taste.</p> <p>The flavour industry emerged in the mid-1800s, as processed foods began to be manufactured on a large scale. Recognising the need for flavour additives, the early food processors turned to perfume companies that had years of experience working with essential oils and volatile aromas. The great perfume houses of England, France and the Netherlands produced many of the first flavour compounds. In the early part of the 20th century, Germany's powerful chemical industry assumed the lead in flavour production. Legend has it that a German scientist discovered methyl anthranilate, one of the first artificial flavours, by accident while mixing chemicals in his laboratory. Suddenly, the lab was filled with the sweet smell of grapes. Methyl anthranilate later became the chief flavouring compound of grape Kool-Aid. </p> <p>After the second world war, much of the perfume industry shifted from Europe to the US, settling in New York City near the garment district and the fashion houses. The flavour industry came with it, subsequently moving to New Jersey to gain more plant capacity. Man-made flavour additives were used mainly in baked goods, sweets and soft drinks until the 50s, when sales of processed food began to soar. The invention of gas chromatographs and mass spectrometers - machines capable of detecting volatile gases at low levels - vastly increased the number of flavours that could be synthesised. By the mid-60s, the American flavour industry was churning out compounds to supply the taste of Pop Tarts, Bac-Os, Tab, Tang, Filet-O-Fish sandwiches and thousands of other new foods.</p> <p>The American flavour industry now has annual revenues of about $1.4bn. Approximately 10,000 new processed food products are introduced every year in the US. Almost all of them require flavour additives. And about nine out of every 10 of these new food products fail. The growth of IFF, in fact, has mirrored that of the flavour industry as a whole. IFF was formed in 1958, through the merger of two small companies. Its annual revenues have grown almost fifteenfold since the early 70s, and it now has manufacturing facilities in 20 countries.</p> <p>The quality that people seek most of all in a food, its flavour, is usually present in a quantity too infinitesimal to be measured by any traditional culinary terms such as ounces or teaspoons. Today's sophisticated spectrometers, gas chromatographs and headspace vapour analysers provide a detailed map of a food's flavour components, detecting chemical aromas in amounts as low as one part per billion. The human nose, however, is still more sensitive than any machine yet invented. A nose can detect aromas present in quantities of a few parts per trillion. Complex aromas, such as those of coffee or roasted meat, may be composed of volatile gases from nearly a thousand different chemicals. The chemical that provides the dominant flavour of bell pepper can be tasted in amounts as low as 0.02 parts per billion; one drop is sufficient to add flavour to the amount of water needed to fill five average-size swimming pools. </p> <p>The flavour additive usually comes last, or second to last, in a processed food's list of ingredients. As a result, the flavour of a processed food often costs less than its packaging. Soft drinks contain a larger proportion of flavour additives than most products. The flavour in a 12oz can of Coke costs about half a cent. </p> <p>The colour additives in processed foods are usually present in even smaller amounts than the flavour compounds. Many of New Jersey's flavour companies also manufacture these colour additives, which are used to make processed foods look fresh and appealing. Food colouring serves many of the same decorative purposes as lipstick, eye shadow, mascara - and is often made from the same pigments. Titanium dioxide, for example, has proved to be an especially versatile mineral. It gives many processed sweets, frostings and icings their bright white colour; it is a common ingredient in women's cosmetics; and it is the pigment used in many white oil paints and house paints. At Burger King, Wendy's and McDonald's, colouring agents have been added to many of the soft drinks, salad dressings, cookies, condiments, chicken dishes and sandwich buns.</p> <p>Studies have found that the colour of a food can greatly affect how its taste is perceived. Brightly coloured foods frequently seem to taste better than bland-looking foods, even when the flavour compounds are identical. Foods that somehow look off-colour often seem to have off tastes. For thousands of years human beings have relied on visual cues to help determine what is edible. The colour of fruit suggests whether it is ripe, the colour of meat whether it is rancid. Flavour researchers sometimes use colured lights to modify the influence of visual cues during taste tests. During one experiment in the early 70s people were served an oddly tinted meal of steak and French fries that appeared normal beneath coloured lights. Everyone thought the meal tasted fine until the lighting was changed. Once it became apparent that the steak was actually blue and the fries were green, some people became ill.</p> <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not require flavour companies to disclose the ingredients of their additives, so long as all the chemicals are considered by the agency to be GRAS (generally regarded as safe). This lack of public disclosure enables the companies to maintain the secrecy of their formulas. The ubiquitous phrase \"artificial strawberry flavour\" gives little hint of the chemical wizardry and manufacturing skill that can make a highly processed food taste like a strawberry.</p> <p>A typical artificial strawberry flavour, such as that found in a Burger King strawberry milk shake, contains the following ingredients: amyl acetate, amyl butyrate, amyl valerate, anethol, anisyl formate, benzyl acetate, benzyl isobutyrate, butyric acid, cinnamyl isobutyrate, cinnamyl valerate, cognac essential oil, diacetyl, dipropyl ketone, ethyl acetate, ethyl amyl ketone, ethyl butyrate, ethyl cinnamate, ethyl heptanoate, ethyl heptylate, ethlyl lactate, ethyl methylphenylglycidate, ethyl nitrate, ethyl propionate, ethyl valerate, heliotropin, hydroxyphenyl-2-butonone (10% solution in alcohol), a-ionone, isobutyl anthranilate, isobutyl butyrate, lemon essential oil, maltol, 4-methylactophenone, methyl anthranilate, methyl benzoate, methyl cinnamate, methyl heptine carbonate, methyl naphthyl ketone, methyl salicylate, mint essential oil, neroli essential oil, nerolin, neryl isobutyrate, orris butter, phenethyl alcohol, rose, rum ether, g-undecalactone, vanillin and solvent.</p> <p>A single compound often supplies the dominant aroma, providing an unmistakable sense of the food. Ethyl-2-methyl butyrate, for example, smells just like an apple. Today's highly processed foods offer a blank palette: whatever chemicals you add will give them specific tastes. Adding methyl-2-peridylketone makes something taste like popcorn. Adding ethyl-3-hydroxybutonoate makes it taste like marshmallow. The possibilities are almost limitless. Without affecting the appearance or nutritional value, processed foods could even be made with aroma chemicals such as hexanal (the smell of freshly cut grass) or 3-methyl butanoic acid (the smell of body odour).</p> <p>The 60s were the heyday of artificial flavours. The synthetic versions of flavour compounds were not subtle, but they did not need to be, given the nature of most processed food. For the past 20 years, food processors have tried hard to use only natural flavours in their products. According to the FDA, these must be derived entirely from natural sources - from herbs, spices, fruits, vegetables, beef, chicken, yeast, bark, roots, etc. Consumers prefer to see natural flavours on a label, out of a belief that they are healthier. </p> <p>But the distinction between artificial and natural flavours can be somewhat arbitrary and absurd, based more on how the flavour has been made than on what it actually contains. \"A natural flavour,\" says Terry Acree, a professor of food science technology at Cornell University, \"is a flavour that's been derived with an out-of-date technology\". Natural flavours and artificial flavours sometimes contain exactly the same chemicals, produced through different methods. Amyl acetate, for example, provides the dominant note of banana flavour. When you distil it from bananas with a solvent, amyl acetate is a natural flavour. When you produce it by mixing vinegar with amyl alcohol, adding sulphuric acid as a catalyst, amyl acetate is an artificial flavour. Either way, it smells and tastes the same. The phrase \"natural flavour\" is now listed among the ingredients of everything from Health Valley Blueberry Granola Bars to Taco Bell Hot Taco Sauce.</p> <p>A natural flavour is not necessarily healthier or purer than an artificial one. When almond flavour (benzaldehyde) is derived from natural sources, such as peach and apricot pits, it contains traces of hydrogen cyanide, a deadly poison. Benzaldehyde, which is derived through a different process (by mixing oil of clove and the banana flavour, amyl acetate) does not contain any cyanide. Nevertheless, it is legally considered an artificial flavour and sells at a much lower price. Natural and artificial flavours are manufactured at the same chemical plants, places that few people would associate with Mother Nature. Calling any of these flavours \"natural\" requires a flexible attitude toward the English language and a fair amount of irony.</p> <p>The small and elite group of scientists who create most of the flavour in most of the food now consumed in the US are called \"flavourists\". They draw upon a number of disciplines in their work: biology, psychology, physiology and organic chemistry. </p> <p>A flavourist is a chemist with a trained nose and a poetic sensibility. Flavours are created by blending scores of different chemicals in tiny amounts, a process governed by scientific principles but demanding a fair amount of art. In an age where delicate aromas, subtle flavours and microwave ovens do not easily coexist, the job of the flavourist is to conjure illusions about processed food and, in the words of one flavour company's literature, to ensure \"consumer likeability\". </p> <p>The flavourists with whom I spoke were charming, cosmopolitan and ironic. They were also discreet, in keeping with the dictates of their trade. They were the sort of scientist who not only enjoyed fine wine, but could also tell you the chemicals that give each vintage its unique aroma. One flavourist compared his work to composing music - a well-made flavour compound will have a \"top note\", followed by a \"dry-down\", and a \"levelling-off\", with different chemicals responsible for each stage. The taste of a food can be radically altered by minute changes in the flavouring mix. \"A little odour goes a long way,\" one flavourist said.</p> <p>In order to give a processed food the proper taste, a flavourist must always consider the food's \"mouthfeel\" - the unique combination of textures and chemical interactions that affects how the flavour is perceived. The mouthfeel can be adjusted through the use of various fats, gums, starches, emulsifiers and stabilisers. The aroma chemicals of a food can be precisely analysed, but mouthfeel is much harder to measure. How does one quantify a French fry's crispness? Food technologists are now conducting basic research in rheology, a branch of physics that examines the flow and deformation of materials. A number of companies sell sophisticated devices that attempt to measure mouthfeel. The TA.XT2i Texture Analyser, produced by the Texture Technologies Corporation, performs calculations based on data derived from as many as 250 separate probes. It is essentially a mechanical mouth. It gauges the most important rheological properties of a food - the bounce, creep, breaking point, density, crunchiness, chewiness, gumminess, lumpiness, rubberiness, slipperiness, smoothness, softness, wetness, juiciness, spreadability, springback and tackiness.</p> <p>Some of the most important advances in flavour manufacturing are now occurring in the field of biotechnology. Complex flavours are being made through fermentation, enzyme reactions, fungal cultures and tissue cultures. All of the flavours being created through these methods - including the ones being synthesised by funguses - are considered natural flavours by the FDA. </p> <p>The new enzyme-based processes are responsible for extremely lifelike dairy flavours. One company now offers not just butter flavour, but also fresh creamy butter, cheesy butter, milky butter, savoury melted butter and super-concentrated butter flavour, in liquid or powder form. The development of new fermentation techniques, as well as new techniques for heating mixtures of sugar and amino acids, have led to the creation of much more realistic meat flavours. The McDonald's Corporation will not reveal the exact origin of the natural flavour added to its French fries. In response to enquiries from Vegetarian Journal, however, McDonald's did acknowledge that its fries derive some of their characteristic flavour from \"animal products\".</p> <p>Other popular fast foods derive their flavour from unexpected sources. Wendy's grilled chicken sandwich, for example, contains beef extracts. Burger King's BK broiler chicken breast patty contains \"natural smoke flavour\". A firm called Red Arrow Products Company specialises in smoke flavour, which is added to barbecue sauces and processed meats. </p> <p>Red Arrow manufactures natural smoke flavour by charring sawdust and capturing the aroma chemicals released into the air. The smoke is captured in water and then bottled, so that other companies can sell food that seems to have been cooked over a fire.</p> <p>The Vegetarian Legal Action Network recently petitioned the FDA to issue new labelling requirement for foods that contain natural flavours. The group wants food processors to list the basic origins of their flavours on their labels. At the moment vegetarians often have no way of knowing whether a flavour additive contains beef, pork, poultry or shellfish. One of the most widely used colour additives - whose presence is often hidden by the phrase \"colour added\" - violates a number of religious dietary restrictions, may cause allergic reactions in susceptible people, and comes from an unusual source. </p> <p>Cochineal extract (also known as carmine or carminic acid) is made from the desiccated bodies of female Dactylopius coccus Costa, a small insect harvested mainly in Peru and the Canary Islands. The bug feeds on red cactus beries, and colour from the berries accumulates in the females and their unhatched larvae. The insects are collected, dried, and ground into a pigment. It takes about 70,000 of them to produce a pound of carmine, which is used to make processed foods look pink, red, or purple. Some strawberry yoghurt gets its colour from carmine, and so do many frozen fruit bars, sweets and fruit fillings, and Ocean Spray pink-grapefruit juice drink.</p> <p>In a meeting room at IFF, Brian Grainger let me sample some of the company's flavours. It was an unusual taste test - there wasn't any food to taste. Grainger is a senior flavourist at IFF, a soft-spoken chemist with greying hair, an English accent and a fondness for understatement. He could easily be mistaken for a British diplomat or the owner of a West End brasserie with two Michelin stars. Like many in the flavour industry, he has an old-world, old-fashioned sensibility which seems out of step with our brand-conscious, egocentric age. </p> <p>When I suggested that IFF should put its own logo on the products that contain its flavours - instead of allowing other brands to enjoy the consumer loyalty and affection inspired by these flavours - Grainger politely disagreed, assuring me that such a thing would never be done. In the absence of public credit or acclaim, the small and secretive fraternity of flavour chemists praises one another's work. Grainger can often tell, by analysing the flavour formula of a product, which of his counterparts at a rival firm devised it. And he enjoys walking down supermarket aisles, looking at the many products that contain his flavours, even if no one else knows it.</p> <p>Grainger had brought a dozen small glass bottles from the lab. As he opened each bottle, I dipped a fragrance-testing filter into it. The filters were long, white strips of paper designed to absorb aroma chemicals without producing off-notes. Before placing the strips of paper before my nose, I closed my eyes. Then I inhaled deeply, and one food after another was conjured from the glass bottles. I smelled fresh cherries, black olives, saut*ed onions and shrimp. Grainger's most remarkable creation took me by surprise. After closing my eyes, I suddenly smelled a grilled hamburger. It smelled like someone else in the room was flipping burgers on a hot grill. But when I opened my eyes, there was just a narrow strip of white paper and a smiling flavourist.</p> <p>\u00a9 Eric Schlosser These are edited extracts from Fast Food Nation: What The All-American Meal Is Doing To The World, by Eric Schlosser, published by Allen Lane The Penguin Press, at \u00a39.99.</p>",

Watch teenagers in uniforms pushing various buttons, and moments later take hold of a plastic tray full of food wrapped in coloured paper and cardboard. The whole experience of buying fast food has become so routine, so thoroughly unexceptional and mundane, that it is now taken for granted, like brushing your teeth or stopping for a red light. It has become a social custom as American as a small, rectangular, hand-held, frozen and reheated apple pie. Over the past three decades, an industry that began with a handful of hot dog and hamburger stands in southern California has spread to almost every corner of the globe. Fast food is now served at restaurants, stadiums, airports, zoos, schools and universities, on cruise ships, trains and aeroplanes, at supermarkets, petrol stations and even in hospital cafeterias. Americans now spend more money on fast food - $110bn last year - than they do on higher education. They spend more on fast food than on movies, books, magazines, newspapers, videos and recorded music - combined. What people eat (or don't eat) has always been determined by a complex interplay of social, economic and technological forces. The early Roman Republic was fed by its citizen-farmers; the Roman Empire, by its slaves. During a relatively brief period of time, the fast food industry has helped transform not only our diet, but also the landscape, economy, workforce and popular culture. Fast food and its consequences have become inescapable, regardless of whether you eat it twice a day or have never taken a single bite. In some cases (such as the malling and sprawling of the west), the fast food industry has been a catalyst and a symptom of larger economic trends. In other cases (such as the rise of franchising and the spread of obesity), fast food has played a central role. Hundreds of millions of people buy fast food every day without giving it much thought, unaware of the subtle and not so subtle ramifications of their purchases. They rarely consider where this food came from, how it was made, what it is doing to the community around them. I think people should know what lies behind the shiny, happy surface of every fast food transaction. They should know what really lurks between those sesame-seed buns. As the old saying goes: You are what you eat. During my research for the book, I ate an enormous amount of fast food. Most of it tasted pretty good. That is one of the main reasons people buy fast food; it has been carefully designed to taste good. The taste of McDonald's French fries, for example, has long been praised by customers, competitors and even food critics. James Beard, the legendary American gourmet, loved McDonald's fries. Their distinctive taste does not stem from the type of potatoes that McDonald's buys, the technology that processes them, or the restaurant equipment that fries them. Other chains buy their French fries from the same large processing companies, use Russet Burbanks and have similar fryers in their restaurant kitchens. The taste of a fast-food fry is largely determined by the cooking oil. For decades, McDonald's cooked its French fries in a mixture of about 7% cottonseed oil and 93% beef tallow. The mix gave the fries their unique flavour - and more saturated beef fat per ounce than a McDonald's hamburger. Amid a barrage of criticism over the amount of cholesterol in its fries, McDonald's switched to pure vegetable oil in 1990. The switch presented the company with an enormous challenge: how to make fries that subtly taste like beef without cooking them in tallow. A look at the ingredients now used in the preparation of McDonald's French fries suggests how the problem was solved. At the end of the list is a seemingly innocuous yet oddly mysterious phrase: \"natural flavour\". That ingredient helps to explain not only why the fries taste so good, but also why most fast food - indeed, most of the food Americans eat today - tastes the way it does. Open your refrigerator, your freezer, your kitchen cupboards, and look at the labels on your food. You'll find \"natural flavour\" or \"artificial flavour\" in just about every list of ingredients. The similarities between these two broad categories are far more significant than their differences. Both are man-made additives that give most processed food its taste. The initial purchase of a food item may be driven by its packaging or appearance, but subsequent purchases are determined mainly by its taste. About 90% of the money that Americans spend on food is used to buy processed food. But the canning, freezing and dehydrating techniques used to process food destroy much of its flavour. Since the end of the second world war, a vast industry has arisen in the US to make processed food palatable. The names of the leading fast-food chains and their bestselling menu items have become famous worldwide, embedded in our popular culture. Few people, however, can name the companies that manufacture fast food's taste. The flavour industry is highly secretive. Its leading companies will not divulge the precise formulas of flavour compounds or the identities of clients. The secrecy is deemed essential for protecting the reputation of beloved brands. The fast-food chains, understandably, would like the public to believe that the flavours of their food somehow originate in their restaurant kitchens, not in distant factories run by other firms. The New Jersey Turnpike runs through the heart of the flavour industry, an industrial corridor dotted with refineries and chemical plants. International Flavours and Fragrances (IFF), the world's largest flavour company, has a manufacturing facility in Dayton, New Jersey. The plant is a huge, pale blue building with a modern office complex attached to the front. It sits in an industrial park, not far from a BASF plastics factory, a Jolly French Toast factory and a plant that manufactures Liz Claiborne cosmetics. Dozens of tractor-trailers were parked at the IFF loading dock the afternoon I visited, and a thin cloud of steam floated from a roof vent. Before entering the plant, I signed a non-disclosure form, promising not to reveal the brand names of products that contain IFF flavours. The place reminded me of Willy Wonka's chocolate factory. Wonderful smells drifted through the hallways, men and women in neat, white lab coats cheerfully went about their work, and hundreds of little glass bottles sat on laboratory tables and shelves. The bottles contained powerful and fragile flavour chemicals, shielded from light by the brown glass and round plastic caps shut tight. The long chemical names on the little white labels were as mystifying to me as medieval Latin. They were the odd-sounding names of things that would be mixed and poured and turned into new substances, like magic potions. I was not invited to see the manufacturing areas of the IFF plant, where it was thought I might discover trade secrets. Instead, I toured various laboratories and pilot kitchens, where the flavours of well-established brands are tested or adjusted, and where whole new flavours are created. IFF's snack and savoury lab is responsible for the flavour of crisps, corn chips, breads, crackers, breakfast cereals and pet food. The confectionery lab devises the flavour for ice cream, biscuits, sweets, toothpastes, mouthwashes and antacids. Everywhere I looked, I saw famous, widely-advertised products sitting on laboratory desks and tables. The beverage lab is full of brightly coloured liquids in clear bottles. It comes up with the flavour for popular soft drinks, sport drinks, bottled teas and wine coolers, for all-natural juice drinks, organic soy drinks, beers and malt liquors. In one pilot kitchen I saw a dapper food technologist, a middle-aged man with an elegant tie beneath his lab coat, carefully preparing a batch of biscuits with white frosting and pink-and-white sprinkles. In another pilot kitchen I saw a pizza oven, a grill, a milk-shake machine, and a French fryer identical to those I'd seen behind the counter at countless fast-food restaurants. In addition to being the world's largest flavour company, IFF manufactures the smell of six of the 10 bestselling perfumes in the US, including Est*e Lauder's Beautiful, Clinique's Happy, Lanc\u00aame's Tr*sor and Calvin Klein's Eternity. It also makes the smell of household products such as deodorant, dishwashing detergent, bath soap, shampoo, furniture polish and floor wax. All of these aromas are made through the same basic process: the manipulation of volatile chemicals to create a particular smell. The basic science behind the scent of your shaving cream is the same as that governing the flavour of your TV dinner. Scientists now believe that human beings acquired the sense of taste as a way to avoid being poisoned. Edible plants generally taste sweet; deadly ones, bitter. Taste is supposed to help us differentiate food that's good for us from food that's not. The tastebuds on our tongues can detect the presence of half a dozen or so basic tastes, including: sweet, sour, bitter, salty, astringent and umami (a taste discovered by Japanese researchers, a rich and full sense of deliciousness triggered by amino acids in foods such as shellfish, mushrooms, potatoes and seaweed). Tastebuds offer a limited means of detection, however, compared with the human olfactory system, which can perceive thousands of different chemical aromas. Indeed, \"flavour\" is primarily the smell of gases being released by the chemicals you've just put in your mouth. The aroma of food can be responsible for as much as 90% of its flavour. The act of drinking, sucking or chewing a substance releases its volatile gases. They flow out of the mouth and up the nostrils, or up the passageway at the back of the mouth, to a thin layer of nerve cells called the olfactory epithelium, located at the base of the nose, right between the eyes. The brain combines the complex smell signals from the epithelium with the simple taste signals from the tongue, assigns a flavour to what's in your mouth, and decides if it's something you want to eat. Babies like sweet tastes and reject bitter ones; we know this because scientists have rubbed various flavours inside the mouths of infants and then recorded their facial reactions. A person's food preferences, like his or her personality, are formed during the first few years of life, through a process of socialisation. Toddlers can learn to enjoy hot and spicy food, bland health food, or fast food, depending upon what the people around them eat. The human sense of smell is still not fully understood. It is greatly affected by psychological factors and expectations. The mind filters out the overwhelming majority of chemical aromas that surround us, focusing intently on some, ignoring others. People can grow accustomed to bad smells or good smells; they stop noticing what once seemed overpowering. Aroma and memory are somehow inextricably linked. A smell can suddenly evoke a long-forgotten moment. The flavours of childhood foods seem to leave an indelible mark, and adults often return to them, without always knowing why. These \"comfort foods\" become a source of pleasure and reassurance, a fact that fast-food chains work hard to promote. Childhood memories of Happy Meals can translate into frequent adult visits to McDonald's, like those of the chain's \"heavy users\", the customers who eat there four or five times a week. The human craving for flavour has been a largely unacknowledged and unexamined force in history. Royal empires have been built, unexplored lands have been traversed, great religions and philosophies have been forever changed by the spice trade. In 1492, Christopher Columbus set sail to find seasoning. Today, the influence of flavour in the world marketplace is no less decisive. The rise and fall of corporate empires - of soft-drink companies, snack-food companies and fast-food chains - is frequently determined by how their products taste. The flavour industry emerged in the mid-1800s, as processed foods began to be manufactured on a large scale. Recognising the need for flavour additives, the early food processors turned to perfume companies that had years of experience working with essential oils and volatile aromas. The great perfume houses of England, France and the Netherlands produced many of the first flavour compounds. In the early part of the 20th century, Germany's powerful chemical industry assumed the lead in flavour production. Legend has it that a German scientist discovered methyl anthranilate, one of the first artificial flavours, by accident while mixing chemicals in his laboratory. Suddenly, the lab was filled with the sweet smell of grapes. Methyl anthranilate later became the chief flavouring compound of grape Kool-Aid. After the second world war, much of the perfume industry shifted from Europe to the US, settling in New York City near the garment district and the fashion houses. The flavour industry came with it, subsequently moving to New Jersey to gain more plant capacity. Man-made flavour additives were used mainly in baked goods, sweets and soft drinks until the 50s, when sales of processed food began to soar. The invention of gas chromatographs and mass spectrometers - machines capable of detecting volatile gases at low levels - vastly increased the number of flavours that could be synthesised. By the mid-60s, the American flavour industry was churning out compounds to supply the taste of Pop Tarts, Bac-Os, Tab, Tang, Filet-O-Fish sandwiches and thousands of other new foods. The American flavour industry now has annual revenues of about $1.4bn. Approximately 10,000 new processed food products are introduced every year in the US. Almost all of them require flavour additives. And about nine out of every 10 of these new food products fail. The growth of IFF, in fact, has mirrored that of the flavour industry as a whole. IFF was formed in 1958, through the merger of two small companies. Its annual revenues have grown almost fifteenfold since the early 70s, and it now has manufacturing facilities in 20 countries. The quality that people seek most of all in a food, its flavour, is usually present in a quantity too infinitesimal to be measured by any traditional culinary terms such as ounces or teaspoons. Today's sophisticated spectrometers, gas chromatographs and headspace vapour analysers provide a detailed map of a food's flavour components, detecting chemical aromas in amounts as low as one part per billion. The human nose, however, is still more sensitive than any machine yet invented. A nose can detect aromas present in quantities of a few parts per trillion. Complex aromas, such as those of coffee or roasted meat, may be composed of volatile gases from nearly a thousand different chemicals. The chemical that provides the dominant flavour of bell pepper can be tasted in amounts as low as 0.02 parts per billion; one drop is sufficient to add flavour to the amount of water needed to fill five average-size swimming pools. The flavour additive usually comes last, or second to last, in a processed food's list of ingredients. As a result, the flavour of a processed food often costs less than its packaging. Soft drinks contain a larger proportion of flavour additives than most products. The flavour in a 12oz can of Coke costs about half a cent. The colour additives in processed foods are usually present in even smaller amounts than the flavour compounds. Many of New Jersey's flavour companies also manufacture these colour additives, which are used to make processed foods look fresh and appealing. Food colouring serves many of the same decorative purposes as lipstick, eye shadow, mascara - and is often made from the same pigments. Titanium dioxide, for example, has proved to be an especially versatile mineral. It gives many processed sweets, frostings and icings their bright white colour; it is a common ingredient in women's cosmetics; and it is the pigment used in many white oil paints and house paints. At Burger King, Wendy's and McDonald's, colouring agents have been added to many of the soft drinks, salad dressings, cookies, condiments, chicken dishes and sandwich buns. Studies have found that the colour of a food can greatly affect how its taste is perceived. Brightly coloured foods frequently seem to taste better than bland-looking foods, even when the flavour compounds are identical. Foods that somehow look off-colour often seem to have off tastes. For thousands of years human beings have relied on visual cues to help determine what is edible. The colour of fruit suggests whether it is ripe, the colour of meat whether it is rancid. Flavour researchers sometimes use colured lights to modify the influence of visual cues during taste tests. During one experiment in the early 70s people were served an oddly tinted meal of steak and French fries that appeared normal beneath coloured lights. Everyone thought the meal tasted fine until the lighting was changed. Once it became apparent that the steak was actually blue and the fries were green, some people became ill. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not require flavour companies to disclose the ingredients of their additives, so long as all the chemicals are considered by the agency to be GRAS (generally regarded as safe). This lack of public disclosure enables the companies to maintain the secrecy of their formulas. The ubiquitous phrase \"artificial strawberry flavour\" gives little hint of the chemical wizardry and manufacturing skill that can make a highly processed food taste like a strawberry. A typical artificial strawberry flavour, such as that found in a Burger King strawberry milk shake, contains the following ingredients: amyl acetate, amyl butyrate, amyl valerate, anethol, anisyl formate, benzyl acetate, benzyl isobutyrate, butyric acid, cinnamyl isobutyrate, cinnamyl valerate, cognac essential oil, diacetyl, dipropyl ketone, ethyl acetate, ethyl amyl ketone, ethyl butyrate, ethyl cinnamate, ethyl heptanoate, ethyl heptylate, ethlyl lactate, ethyl methylphenylglycidate, ethyl nitrate, ethyl propionate, ethyl valerate, heliotropin, hydroxyphenyl-2-butonone (10% solution in alcohol), a-ionone, isobutyl anthranilate, isobutyl butyrate, lemon essential oil, maltol, 4-methylactophenone, methyl anthranilate, methyl benzoate, methyl cinnamate, methyl heptine carbonate, methyl naphthyl ketone, methyl salicylate, mint essential oil, neroli essential oil, nerolin, neryl isobutyrate, orris butter, phenethyl alcohol, rose, rum ether, g-undecalactone, vanillin and solvent. A single compound often supplies the dominant aroma, providing an unmistakable sense of the food. Ethyl-2-methyl butyrate, for example, smells just like an apple. Today's highly processed foods offer a blank palette: whatever chemicals you add will give them specific tastes. Adding methyl-2-peridylketone makes something taste like popcorn. Adding ethyl-3-hydroxybutonoate makes it taste like marshmallow. The possibilities are almost limitless. Without affecting the appearance or nutritional value, processed foods could even be made with aroma chemicals such as hexanal (the smell of freshly cut grass) or 3-methyl butanoic acid (the smell of body odour). The 60s were the heyday of artificial flavours. The synthetic versions of flavour compounds were not subtle, but they did not need to be, given the nature of most processed food. For the past 20 years, food processors have tried hard to use only natural flavours in their products. According to the FDA, these must be derived entirely from natural sources - from herbs, spices, fruits, vegetables, beef, chicken, yeast, bark, roots, etc. Consumers prefer to see natural flavours on a label, out of a belief that they are healthier. But the distinction between artificial and natural flavours can be somewhat arbitrary and absurd, based more on how the flavour has been made than on what it actually contains. \"A natural flavour,\" says Terry Acree, a professor of food science technology at Cornell University, \"is a flavour that's been derived with an out-of-date technology\". Natural flavours and artificial flavours sometimes contain exactly the same chemicals, produced through different methods. Amyl acetate, for example, provides the dominant note of banana flavour. When you distil it from bananas with a solvent, amyl acetate is a natural flavour. When you produce it by mixing vinegar with amyl alcohol, adding sulphuric acid as a catalyst, amyl acetate is an artificial flavour. Either way, it smells and tastes the same. The phrase \"natural flavour\" is now listed among the ingredients of everything from Health Valley Blueberry Granola Bars to Taco Bell Hot Taco Sauce. A natural flavour is not necessarily healthier or purer than an artificial one. When almond flavour (benzaldehyde) is derived from natural sources, such as peach and apricot pits, it contains traces of hydrogen cyanide, a deadly poison. Benzaldehyde, which is derived through a different process (by mixing oil of clove and the banana flavour, amyl acetate) does not contain any cyanide. Nevertheless, it is legally considered an artificial flavour and sells at a much lower price. Natural and artificial flavours are manufactured at the same chemical plants, places that few people would associate with Mother Nature. Calling any of these flavours \"natural\" requires a flexible attitude toward the English language and a fair amount of irony. The small and elite group of scientists who create most of the flavour in most of the food now consumed in the US are called \"flavourists\". They draw upon a number of disciplines in their work: biology, psychology, physiology and organic chemistry. A flavourist is a chemist with a trained nose and a poetic sensibility. Flavours are created by blending scores of different chemicals in tiny amounts, a process governed by scientific principles but demanding a fair amount of art. In an age where delicate aromas, subtle flavours and microwave ovens do not easily coexist, the job of the flavourist is to conjure illusions about processed food and, in the words of one flavour company's literature, to ensure \"consumer likeability\". The flavourists with whom I spoke were charming, cosmopolitan and ironic. They were also discreet, in keeping with the dictates of their trade. They were the sort of scientist who not only enjoyed fine wine, but could also tell you the chemicals that give each vintage its unique aroma. One flavourist compared his work to composing music - a well-made flavour compound will have a \"top note\", followed by a \"dry-down\", and a \"levelling-off\", with different chemicals responsible for each stage. The taste of a food can be radically altered by minute changes in the flavouring mix. \"A little odour goes a long way,\" one flavourist said. In order to give a processed food the proper taste, a flavourist must always consider the food's \"mouthfeel\" - the unique combination of textures and chemical interactions that affects how the flavour is perceived. The mouthfeel can be adjusted through the use of various fats, gums, starches, emulsifiers and stabilisers. The aroma chemicals of a food can be precisely analysed, but mouthfeel is much harder to measure. How does one quantify a French fry's crispness? Food technologists are now conducting basic research in rheology, a branch of physics that examines the flow and deformation of materials. A number of companies sell sophisticated devices that attempt to measure mouthfeel. The TA.XT2i Texture Analyser, produced by the Texture Technologies Corporation, performs calculations based on data derived from as many as 250 separate probes. It is essentially a mechanical mouth. It gauges the most important rheological properties of a food - the bounce, creep, breaking point, density, crunchiness, chewiness, gumminess, lumpiness, rubberiness, slipperiness, smoothness, softness, wetness, juiciness, spreadability, springback and tackiness. Some of the most important advances in flavour manufacturing are now occurring in the field of biotechnology. Complex flavours are being made through fermentation, enzyme reactions, fungal cultures and tissue cultures. All of the flavours being created through these methods - including the ones being synthesised by funguses - are considered natural flavours by the FDA. The new enzyme-based processes are responsible for extremely lifelike dairy flavours. One company now offers not just butter flavour, but also fresh creamy butter, cheesy butter, milky butter, savoury melted butter and super-concentrated butter flavour, in liquid or powder form. The development of new fermentation techniques, as well as new techniques for heating mixtures of sugar and amino acids, have led to the creation of much more realistic meat flavours. The McDonald's Corporation will not reveal the exact origin of the natural flavour added to its French fries. In response to enquiries from Vegetarian Journal, however, McDonald's did acknowledge that its fries derive some of their characteristic flavour from \"animal products\". Other popular fast foods derive their flavour from unexpected sources. Wendy's grilled chicken sandwich, for example, contains beef extracts. Burger King's BK broiler chicken breast patty contains \"natural smoke flavour\". A firm called Red Arrow Products Company specialises in smoke flavour, which is added to barbecue sauces and processed meats. Red Arrow manufactures natural smoke flavour by charring sawdust and capturing the aroma chemicals released into the air. The smoke is captured in water and then bottled, so that other companies can sell food that seems to have been cooked over a fire. The Vegetarian Legal Action Network recently petitioned the FDA to issue new labelling requirement for foods that contain natural flavours. The group wants food processors to list the basic origins of their flavours on their labels. At the moment vegetarians often have no way of knowing whether a flavour additive contains beef, pork, poultry or shellfish. One of the most widely used colour additives - whose presence is often hidden by the phrase \"colour added\" - violates a number of religious dietary restrictions, may cause allergic reactions in susceptible people, and comes from an unusual source. Cochineal extract (also known as carmine or carminic acid) is made from the desiccated bodies of female Dactylopius coccus Costa, a small insect harvested mainly in Peru and the Canary Islands. The bug feeds on red cactus beries, and colour from the berries accumulates in the females and their unhatched larvae. The insects are collected, dried, and ground into a pigment. It takes about 70,000 of them to produce a pound of carmine, which is used to make processed foods look pink, red, or purple. Some strawberry yoghurt gets its colour from carmine, and so do many frozen fruit bars, sweets and fruit fillings, and Ocean Spray pink-grapefruit juice drink. In a meeting room at IFF, Brian Grainger let me sample some of the company's flavours. It was an unusual taste test - there wasn't any food to taste. Grainger is a senior flavourist at IFF, a soft-spoken chemist with greying hair, an English accent and a fondness for understatement. He could easily be mistaken for a British diplomat or the owner of a West End brasserie with two Michelin stars. Like many in the flavour industry, he has an old-world, old-fashioned sensibility which seems out of step with our brand-conscious, egocentric age. When I suggested that IFF should put its own logo on the products that contain its flavours - instead of allowing other brands to enjoy the consumer loyalty and affection inspired by these flavours - Grainger politely disagreed, assuring me that such a thing would never be done. In the absence of public credit or acclaim, the small and secretive fraternity of flavour chemists praises one another's work. Grainger can often tell, by analysing the flavour formula of a product, which of his counterparts at a rival firm devised it. And he enjoys walking down supermarket aisles, looking at the many products that contain his flavours, even if no one else knows it. Grainger had brought a dozen small glass bottles from the lab. As he opened each bottle, I dipped a fragrance-testing filter into it. The filters were long, white strips of paper designed to absorb aroma chemicals without producing off-notes. Before placing the strips of paper before my nose, I closed my eyes. Then I inhaled deeply, and one food after another was conjured from the glass bottles. I smelled fresh cherries, black olives, saut*ed onions and shrimp. Grainger's most remarkable creation took me by surprise. After closing my eyes, I suddenly smelled a grilled hamburger.

In other words, some little artery feeding the brain cells in charge of my eye muscles had got clogged up, causing these brain cells to die and depriving my right eye of its muscle controllers.

American meat production has never before been so centralised: 13 large packinghouses now slaughter most of the beef consumed in the United States.

Stomachs and intestines are still pulled out of cattle by hand; if the job is not performed carefully, the contents of the digestive system may spill everywhere. The increased speed of today's production lines makes the task much more difficult - and the consequences of a single error are quickly multiplied as hundreds of carcasses quickly move down the line.

Twenty years ago, most chicken was sold whole; today, about 90% of the chicken sold in the US has been cut into pieces, cutlets or nuggets.

I refer to Ch\u00e2teau de Nages Costi\u00e8res de Nimes 1998 at Oddbins. This characterful and beautifully priced wine is fantastic value: it sports wonderful tarry, sticky tannins and very deep, rich, baked, herby fruit of complexity and presence.

Dallas-Conte Rapel Valley Chardonnay 1999 (17 points, \u00a35.99, Oddbins), from Chile, is breathtakingly stylish, with hints of apricot, pineapple, melon and lots of citric layering. Beautifully structured and immensely classy, it's a benchmark example of the sort of exceptional value-for-money wines that Chile, as well as other new world producers, can conjure from their soils. And Villa Maria Reserve Riesling 1999 (17 points, \u00a38.99, Oddbins Fine Wine Stores), from New Zealand, is also a superb white wine that will improve over many years to become more petroleum-charged aromatically and oilier in texture. As it stands, it has mineral overtones and subtly spicy, melony fruit, and is quite gorgeous.</p> <p>At Majestic, there is Chablis 1er Cru Beauroy 1996 (15.5 points, in the half bottle for \u00a34.99). It's a first-rate Chablis, this: chardonnay in its steely mould. What does Oz have to compete? Bethany Chardonnay 1999 (16.5 points, \u00a37.99) has superb texture and balance of elegant elements. This is a truly exceptional chardonnay for the money. Also at Majestic, Coupe Roses Les Plots Minervois 1999 (16 points, \u00a36.99) is an entertaining red. It fair gushes with dry, rich, red fruit that develops well on the tastebuds, revealing complexity and a firm finish. This wine is in very short supply, however, and stocks are running low. </p> <p>At Sainsbury's a decade ago, there were just 16 Aussie wines on shelf. Now there are 86. This is a measure of the Aussies' progress. There were also, for example, no South African wines at JS (for obvious political reasons at that time), but now there are 49. </p> <p>Two of them are here today. The store's South African non-vintage Chardonnay (15.5 points, \u00a33.99) is a bargain with its subtle fruit and gentle acids. Kumala Chardonnay 2000 (15.5 points, \u00a34.99) is weightier, offering big, rich, smoky musky, fruit that is just brilliant with oriental food.</p> <p>\u0095 For the latest wine news, or to email Malcolm Gluck, visit <a href=\"http://www.superplonk.com\">superplonk.com</a>.</p>",

Kumala Chardonnay 2000 (15.5 points, \u00a34.99) is weightier, offering big, rich, smoky musky, fruit that is just brilliant with oriental food. \u0095 For the latest wine news, or to email Malcolm Gluck, visit superplonk.com.",

      "body": "<p>I nearly ate one of the cat's steroid tablets this morning. It was an easy enough mistake to make. The small, brown bottle is hidden among my vitamin C, echinacea and other bottles, on a kitchen window ledge that could double as a bring-and-buy stall. Despite having had a handmade, state-of-the-art kitchen installed only last summer, the window ledge has fast become a dumping ground for everything from an unopened bottle of Baby Bio to a half-eaten packet of Maltesers. Not to mention the windows themselves. They remain naked after a combination of inertia and lack of funds bled away any ideas of \"dressing\".</p> <p>The kitchen window, the hallway, the toilet under the stairs - these are some of the many areas of the house that swiftly develop into blind spots. They are spaces that have been overlooked for so long, it's hard to see how they could be put to better use. They are the areas where the imagination comes to an abrupt halt.</p> <p>This is not a problem that can be quickly resolved with a visit to the dump and a can of Pledge. Oh no. Unless you invest in the professional help of an architect or interior designer, it is often impossible to make sense of those blind spots. It's as much to do with familiarity as lack of visual imagination. Once you've shoved the Hoover under the stairs for the umpteenth time, it is unlikely you will ever see that space as \"going to waste\". And when the sofa has been pushed flat against the wall to try and open up your narrow, knocked-through sitting room, will it ever be moved again? Not likely.</p> <p>Of course, there aren't generic solutions to these problems. No house is the same, and everyone's budget is different. But just by noticing that it's a waste using 4m sq as a dumping ground, you may start to find ways to utilise your home to better effect.</p> <p><br><b>Hallways</b><br></p> <p>The hallway is a space that is used more regularly than any other, and offers a first impression of what your house says about you to the outside world. But most of us spend far more time agonising about what taps to put in the bathroom than what the hall looks like. The hall should set the tone for the rest of your house. Using mismatched off-cuts of carpet as a couple of runners, which I did until I tripped over them once too often (not ideal with a new baby), is not quite the tone you're looking for.</p> <p>'Make it look welcoming. It's the first bit that anyone sees,' says textile designer Roger Oates. 'I think people forget it's a room, and although you don't spend a lot of time in it you do use it all the time, so give yourself some basic facilities: a bench or stool that you can sit on to take off your shoes, attractive hooks to hang things on. Make it look like a statement and as if it belongs.'</p> <p>It's also the space where all the dirt comes in, so if you're laying a runner, put something on it that will take care of the dirt and is easy to clean, such as entrance matting. If there's room, put a table in the hall and landing as a repository for things waiting to go up and down stairs. Dawna Walter, an expert in clutter-free living, has 10 baskets sitting on her staircase. 'You always get to the top of the stairs and have forgotten something. We put things we need in the baskets and it's a rule of the house that we take one up when we go upstairs.'</p> <p>Interiors writer Fay Sweet is more concerned with discovering hidden possibilities with the space available. 'Looking up is the thing to do with halls. Look at any area where there's a massive amount of head space and think of ways to utilise it.' Sweet suggests putting bicycles and scooters on pullies - to suspend them high up - or lining the walls with books.</p> <p>For the really brutal clean-sweep, get rid of the hall altogether. 'Do away with them or bring in as much light as possible,' says Robert Sakula, of Ash Sakula Architects. 'We are obsessed with halls in this country. With the climate changing, you don't need two doors between you and the outside world to keep out drafts any more.' If he can't persuade a client to knock down the dividing hall wall, Sakula tackles the problem of light by changing the doors leading off the hallway. 'Doors tend to open away from the hall, so all the light bounces inside the room, and casts a shadow into the hallway. We swing them the other way, to let light into the hallway. If the hall is lit well it can be joyous.'</p> <p>In one award-winning project by Sakula, a new house on a small, central London site, the stairwell is without walls, forming instead a delicate free-standing spiral - known as the 'tulip' - at the centre of the house. The space around the tulip has been used to the max: low cupboards beside it contain washing and drying machines, with a slate worktop. The neighbouring rooms flow from this central space, without doors or rigid walls sectioning them off.</p> <p><br><b>Kitchens</b><br></p> <p>Nothing gets us into quite such a lather as the thought of a fully-integrated, Smeg-ed up kitchen. But somehow we haven't quite shaken off memories of the past when mother spent all her days washing up looking wistfully out at her herbaceous borders. Tiny little pockets of cosiness still creep into the most sophisticated designer kitchen, nowhere more so than at the kitchen window.</p> <p>A representative of one of the smarter kitchen companies admits that she is frequently horrified when she visits a client's kitchen once it has been installed. 'What they put at the window,' she gasps, 'it's grim; they kill the whole look.' Richard Jackson, of Mark Wilkinson kitchens, says most people still want sinks looking out of the window. To resolve the bric-a-brac window ledge dilemma, he suggests that if your ledge is the same height as the work top, to run the work top area into the window to give a much bigger working surface.</p> <p>Clutter-free queen Walter has targeted her kitchen as well as her stairs. 'You have to reassess everything all the time,' she orders. 'Most people move in, unpack and never make any changes after that. You have to change the routine. Clear everything off the windowsill and then see what it looks like. Mine has seven different plants which I meticulously take care of because I see them all the time, they are in front of me.'</p> <p>If you've got enough light, growing plants can be a useful option. Florist and landscape gardener Stephen Woodhams suggests individual galvanised/aluminium containers, each planted with a single herb - rosemary, thyme, sage, basil, parsley and chives. Darke says make a feature of your kitchen window: 'If the windows are completely rotten we knock them out and relocate the window to put the frame on the outside wall and cover the brickwork with a timber lining. You can make a huge deep window ledge which jutts outwards, rather than inwards.' Perfect for displaying his collection of 1950s china.</p> <p>If your new, deep windowsill is low enough, make a seat out of it, throw out those, hideous mouldy old blinds and your kitchen may start to have a hint of the John Pawson about it.</p> <p><br><b>Long living rooms/alcoves</b><br></p> <p>In an attempt to give the 'best' room in the house more space, most Victorian terraced properties today have a knocked-through living room that may provide more square metres but often ends up feeling long, narrow and dark. Once a sofa has been added flat against one wall (generally opposite the fireplace), with bookshelves in either alcove, the waiting-room effect is complete. The resulting feeling is that the only way you can walk from one end of the room to the other is in crab-mode or by doing a bit of line dancing.</p> <p>Jon Darke, of SEF Architects, suggests knocking out the hallway, 'so that you get a room that goes the full width of the property; it can transform a house.' Until recently, it's been the fashion to retain a sense of two separate rooms by keeping an arch between them, thus providing even more alcoves to fill. 'If you pay a bit more and knock out all of it, you get a free-flowing room which seems much more spacious, and you get rid of all those nooks and crannies that you don't know what to do with,' says Darke. This rather major demolition work is fine, generally, for two-storey houses, but if your house is three storeys or more it may be deemed a fire risk and Darke advises seeking planning permission for any heavy duty building work.</p> <p>Andrew Weaving, who owns the modernist furniture shop Century, has gone to great lengths to make his narrow, early Victorian terrace appear wider. By putting in a supporting beam between two small living rooms, Weaving was able to knock through the dividing wall and knock through into the hallway, replacing this wall with a floor-to-ceiling sliding panel which is made of wood. 'The back room is usually more of a problem in these houses because of the staircase, so we turned the staircase round to give us more room in the hallway and also in the living room when we leave the wooden partition open.'</p> <p>To add to the sense of space in his living room, Weaving has hung a huge floor-to-ceiling picture, by Bruce McClean, on one wall - the Perspex mount reflecting any light in the room - and has placed sofas at both ends to square up the space. Small pieces of furniture have been dispersed through the centre of the room to prevent the eye focusing on one area.</p> <p>Alcoves are another problem area: if you fill them with bookshelves (and everyone does) your space appears even more restricted. 'It's as if people see a shelf and say, \"Better line them with books\",' says interiors stylist Hilary Robertson. Robertson has a particular loathing of those bookshelf units with cupboards underneath that every carpenter in town seems to specialise in. 'I call them posh cupboards that the Sloanes have. They're standard issue with every Clapham house.' To resolve the alcove issue and the equally thorny problem of what to do with the telly, Robertson has covered an alcove in silver leaf and put her telly in it on a silver table, making a feature of the whole area. Alternatively, a floor-to-ceiling mirror in an alcove can give the effect of an opening into another room.</p> <p>If you do need shelving, try to avoid standard-issue horizontal lines - Ron Arad's Bookworm shelves, from Purves &amp; Purves, can bend into spirals or long, wavy lines; or look at the new Atom circular shelving system by Stone Circle.</p> <p>Use paint to give the illusion of changing the dimensions of a room. Sue Gosling, colour adviser at Dulux, suggests using a slightly darker shade of your chosen colour at either end of the room to square it up and make it appear wider. To make a high ceiling appear lower, use a darker colour or shade to create a more cosy feeling. Posh cupboards, or not, what most of us end up putting in an alcove is the telly. 'Although everybody watches it, you don't want to give the television iconic status,' says Sakula. By putting the television on the other side of the room and moving seating into each alcove, the fireplace remains as the natural focus of the room.</p> <p><br><b>Under stairs cupboards, and loo</b><br></p> <p>Perhaps the most ignored space in the home is the area under the stairs. There's little you can do, without getting involved with costly building work. If you are going to keep it as a general storage area (and the Hoover's got to go somewhere) put a light inside the cupboard so you don't have to feel your way through to that rusty pair of secateurs.</p> <p>'We never seem to put lighting into cupboards in this country - under the stairs or in the kitchen. It's as if we've got a thing about it,' says Sweet, who reckons the best use of the area is to open it and line it with book shelves. 'Some people try to make offices out of the space, but that can be a bit dismal.'</p> <p>Doug Sandle, chartered psychologist at Leeds Metropolitan University, thinks there may be deeper reasons why this area of the house is so often neglected. 'The broom cupboard, the shed, the space under the stairs, all have a mythical status for dark and unpleasant things. They feature as unpleasant places in stories and folk lore (something rotten in the woodshed, skeletons in the cupboard). As such they have a psychodynamic use as a store for the darker and disturbing things in life. Many of us will have had a creepy experience or feeling about such small spaces. Better we leave them undisturbed and not look at them in the bright light of day.'</p> <p>If the area is large enough and you can afford to, put in a downstairs loo - it will prove not only useful, but will add value to your property. Because it's likely to be a small space, keep it simple. 'There are tricks you can use to make it look bigger,' says Melanie Somerville of bathroom suppliers CP Hart. 'Buy a wall-mounted basin, so you don't have a pedestal, and a wall-hung toilet, so you have the space clear underneath. It's easy to clean, and if you have young children you can mount it at a height that suits them.' Finally, put plain colours on the walls, try and avoid tiles, which will make the room look smaller, and on no account frame the wall with cartoons.</p>",

Finally, put plain colours on the walls, try and avoid tiles, which will make the room look smaller, and on no account frame the wall with cartoons.",

An exhibition, Robin and Lucienne Day: Pioneers of Contemporary Design, is at the Barbican Gallery, London, until April 16. The couple live in Sussex. What is your greatest fear? Going blind. Which living person do you most admire? Sir David Attenborough for his amazing wildlife programmes, and for alerting us all to the perils we face if we don't mend our ways. What is the trait you most deplore in yourself? Not being able to think quickly enough. What is the trait you most deplore in others? Procrastination. What is your greatest extravagance? Taking taxis everywhere in London. What makes you depressed? Not being able to stop certain flagrant cruelties. What has been your most embarrassing moment? When, as head of school, I forgot my welcoming speech, in French, to a visiting dignitary. What do you most dislike about your appearance? My ageing face. What is your favourite smell? Lilies in my garden. What is your favourite word? Juniper, because it sounds beautiful. What is your favourite journey? Plant-hunting in the Mediterranean, or in the mountains of Italy or Spain. How did you vote in the last election? New Labour. How will you vote in the next election? New Labour. Should the royal family be scrapped? No - a president would be worse. Do you believe in capital punishment? No, that's murder which I deplore. Do you believe in monogamy? On the whole, yes. When and where were you happiest? The day my daughter was born. Do you believe in life after death? I don't think so, but perhaps I'll be proved wrong. How would you like to be remembered? As a first-rate designer. What is the most important lesson life has taught you? To be honest.",

Apart from well-preserved metal bindings, decorative work and iron \"tyres\", the trove includes sections of wooden wheels, horse harnesses and an exceptionally detailed \"ghost\" of the long since rotted yoke. \"A mould has been taken to reconstruct the form of this, the first time this has been done,\" said David Miles, chief archaeologist for English Heritage, which is also working with the Museum on the grave's intact skeleton, pottery and animal bones found nearby. \"The person in the grave was clearly very important and was buried with a rite clearly linked to the continent,\" he said. The museum and English Heritage praised local developer Hogg the Builders, who plan to construct five houses on the site, for model practice over the dig. Apart from financing the initial excavation, the firm was given credit for what Mr Miles called \"one of the most significant and exciting middle iron age burials ever found\". Adrian Havercroft, chief excavator at Wetwang, said: \"These fabulous things were only discovered because Hogg's decided on a final check after we had found a ditch surrounding a barrow. One of our trenches and had missed the grave pit by a whisker.\" The chariot is thought to be very similar to those famously described in Caesar's invasion of Britain, 300 years later, when 4,000 of the twin-horse vehicles massed under the British chieftain Cassivellaunus to defend the Thames crossing. \"When the barbarians meet with cavalry in battle, they cast their javelins at the enemy and then, descending from the chariot, join battle with their swords.\"",

The North London club was seeking court orders to protect the rights to its name, the nickname Gunners and the club crest and cannon emblem. Trader and Arsenal fan Matthew Reed had used the name and logos on scarves, hats and shirts which he sold from stalls near the club's Highbury ground. Yesterday Mr Justice Laddie upheld the trader's defence that he was using the marks as \"badges of allegiance\" so that fans could declare their support. The club complained that Mr Reed, of Stanford le Hope, Essex, was guilty of \"passing off\" his goods as the real thing. But Mr Reed's lawyers said there was an established trade in unofficial football club merchandise and that fans knew the difference. However, the judge ruled that the trader's use of the trademarks as badges of allegiance could still be an infringement of the club's rights. This question, he said, could only be decided by the European court of justice. The hearing resumes on May 1 when the court will decide whether the case should be referred straight to Europe or go to the court of appeal. In the meantime Mr Reed can carry on trading. The trader has been an Arsenal fan since the early 1960s and began his business as the proprietor of a wholesale and retail football merchandise company more than 30 years ago. The football club has been in dispute with him for 10 years. The ruling means football clubs could now be exposed to competition from bootleg traders without being able to retaliate in the courts. Oliver Butler, editor of Soccer Investor magazine, said: \"This will make clubs think twice about taking court action, if this precedent has been set.\" But the sale of merchandise is not the cash cow it once was. \"We're seeing merchandising sales stagnate or decrease. It isn't such a great source of revenue as TV or gate receipts.\" Arsenal has used both criminal and civil law against traders selling goods without its licence. Some had been prosecuted by trading standards officers, resulting in fines, community service orders, probation orders and the destruction of stock. Match programmes have contained articles about the steps taken by the club to stop the sale of \"counterfeit or illegal\" goods.",

      "body": "<b> Should I sell bonds for a better return? </b> <p> I invested \u00a35,000 in premium bonds in 1997. I won prizes worth 5% in the first two years, just 2% in the third year, and nothing over the past six months. Should I cut my losses and sell the bonds? <br><b> PH, Surrey</b><br><br> The premium bond prize fund returns 4% of the total in bonds tax-free - it has been reduced this month from 4.25%. The bigger your holding, the more likely you are to attain this average return. Anyone with a \u00a35,000 holding is statistically likely to have a run of months with no prizes. But you could soon be lucky enough to win one of the 300 or so major prizes a month of between \u00a35,000 and \u00a31m. If you like the idea of a low risk punt, stick with the bonds -Ernie is a better deal than the national lottery. But if you want an income, sell - you can do better elsewhere. </p> <p> <b> Sickness cover and the artist </b></p> <p> I'm a self-employed artist aged 53 living hand to mouth: so I'm good at surviving. But I do have occasional worries about the future. Although I can hardly afford to, should I take out sickness cover in case I can't work? I'm a single parent, claiming working families tax credit. I have very little savings.<br> <b> AB, Powys</b> </p> <p> Don't waste your money on insurance. At your age, sickness cover will be very expensive. And there is the additional problem of claiming - you would have to be very ill or extremely disabled for insurance companies to admit you could not work any longer as an artist, not an occupational group they have any experience of, or sympathy with. Even the most basic cover - \u00a3100,000 if you die or suffer a serious illness such as cancer or heart attack - will cost you around \u00a3100 a month. As your savings are low and you already qualify for working families tax credit, you would be better off claiming income support if you are ill enough to stop work. </p> <p> <b> Smaller car, but refused a rebate</b> </p> <p>The Budget said cars up to 1,500cc will qualify for a \u00a355 a year reduction in the tax disc, backdated to November 2000. I have a 1,300cc car, but the DVLA in Swansea has refused me a rebate. What's going on? <br><b> GO, Middlesex</b> </p> <p> Your car will qualify - but you must wait until July 1 before you can apply for a rebate back to November 1. This is to stop claims for cars that are scrapped between now and July 1. </p> <p> <b> I'm charged for foreign cheques</b> </p> <p> I am an academic receiving small royalty cheques from publishers. In January I was sent a US cheque for $175 - worth around \u00a3119 at current rates. But my bank, the Woolwich, told me they were unable to clear foreign cheques. We would have to use American Express for a \u00a37.50 fee. But it did not end there. American Express hit me with a further \u00a352.75 charge. I received \u00a358.49 - I had lost half my money. </p> <p>We switched our current account from Barclays to Woolwich last September to take advantage of the Open Plan mortgage deal. Barclays, which now owns the Woolwich, had charged for foreign cheques, but nothing like this. Is this a quirk of the Woolwich cheque clearing system or a feature common to the newly converted banks? <br><b> LB, south-west London</b> </p> <p> The Woolwich admits that it does not offer all the facilities of traditional high street banks. It says the Amex charge was out of its control. But it concedes that the Woolwich branch should have either advised you to go elsewhere or warned of the charges. The branch did neither, which Woolwich, to its credit, accepts was unfair. It is refunding the \u00a360.25 fee. One solution is to keep an old account open for these occasional transaction. </p> <p> <b> Interest paid on storecard goods</b> </p> <p>We have a Selfridges storecard which we usually pay off in full every month. However, in February, we forgot to pay \u00a334.95 which was then carried over on to our March bill. They then imposed a service charge (2% per month) of \u00a37.70 on the \u00a3385 bill.

      "bodyText": "Should I sell bonds for a better return? I invested \u00a35,000 in premium bonds in 1997. I won prizes worth 5% in the first two years, just 2% in the third year, and nothing over the past six months. Should I cut my losses and sell the bonds? PH, Surrey The premium bond prize fund returns 4% of the total in bonds tax-free - it has been reduced this month from 4.25%. The bigger your holding, the more likely you are to attain this average return. Anyone with a \u00a35,000 holding is statistically likely to have a run of months with no prizes. But you could soon be lucky enough to win one of the 300 or so major prizes a month of between \u00a35,000 and \u00a31m. If you like the idea of a low risk punt, stick with the bonds -Ernie is a better deal than the national lottery. But if you want an income, sell - you can do better elsewhere. Sickness cover and the artist I'm a self-employed artist aged 53 living hand to mouth: so I'm good at surviving. But I do have occasional worries about the future. Although I can hardly afford to, should I take out sickness cover in case I can't work? I'm a single parent, claiming working families tax credit. I have very little savings. AB, Powys Don't waste your money on insurance. At your age, sickness cover will be very expensive. And there is the additional problem of claiming - you would have to be very ill or extremely disabled for insurance companies to admit you could not work any longer as an artist, not an occupational group they have any experience of, or sympathy with. Even the most basic cover - \u00a3100,000 if you die or suffer a serious illness such as cancer or heart attack - will cost you around \u00a3100 a month. As your savings are low and you already qualify for working families tax credit, you would be better off claiming income support if you are ill enough to stop work. Smaller car, but refused a rebate The Budget said cars up to 1,500cc will qualify for a \u00a355 a year reduction in the tax disc, backdated to November 2000. I have a 1,300cc car, but the DVLA in Swansea has refused me a rebate. What's going on? GO, Middlesex Your car will qualify - but you must wait until July 1 before you can apply for a rebate back to November 1. This is to stop claims for cars that are scrapped between now and July 1. I'm charged for foreign cheques I am an academic receiving small royalty cheques from publishers. In January I was sent a US cheque for $175 - worth around \u00a3119 at current rates. But my bank, the Woolwich, told me they were unable to clear foreign cheques. We would have to use American Express for a \u00a37.50 fee. But it did not end there. American Express hit me with a further \u00a352.75 charge. I received \u00a358.49 - I had lost half my money. We switched our current account from Barclays to Woolwich last September to take advantage of the Open Plan mortgage deal. Barclays, which now owns the Woolwich, had charged for foreign cheques, but nothing like this. Is this a quirk of the Woolwich cheque clearing system or a feature common to the newly converted banks? LB, south-west London The Woolwich admits that it does not offer all the facilities of traditional high street banks. It says the Amex charge was out of its control. But it concedes that the Woolwich branch should have either advised you to go elsewhere or warned of the charges. The branch did neither, which Woolwich, to its credit, accepts was unfair. It is refunding the \u00a360.25 fee. One solution is to keep an old account open for these occasional transaction. Interest paid on storecard goods We have a Selfridges storecard which we usually pay off in full every month. However, in February, we forgot to pay \u00a334.95 which was then carried over on to our March bill. They then imposed a service charge (2% per month) of \u00a37.70 on the \u00a3385 bill. Since the March bill was not then due, can they charge me interest on purchases ahead of the payment date? LC, London Yes. Rules on cards vary, but most only allow an interest-free period on purchases if your debt was cleared on the previous bill. Card issuers argue that you have borrowed money so you should pay. Take the tax-free sum and get out Participants in Equitable Life personal pension schemes without a guaranteed annuity rate are likely to see low growth rates in future. It, therefore, appears a good but undiscussed strategy for people between 60 and 65 to make a penalty-free exit from the Equitable now by taking the maximum tax-free cash sum and converting the remainder to an annuity from elsewhere, even if they intend to continue working for a few more years. Are there any legal impediments or hidden financial disadvantages to collecting benefits from one pension plan while still earning and contributing 40% of salary to a new pension plan? DG, Essex Given the present uncertainty, there is no point in throwing more money at Equitable Life - especially if you do not have a guaranteed annuity rate. The new stakeholder pension regime means that most providers can now rival Equitable's low cost flexibility - the basic reason for that company's success given its less than inspiring investment record. There is no legal reason why you should not cash in on one personal pension while continuing to contribute to another but you should check the figures add up for your personal needs. As you are over 60, you could contribute up to 40% of your income from earnings - not investments or annuities - into a personal pension plan. This could be tax-efficient. If you are a 40% taxpayer, you could pay in \u00a31,000, receive \u00a3400 back in tax relief, encash your pension still worth \u00a31,000 and take \u00a3250 (25%) as a tax-free lump sum. The remaining \u00a3750 (assuming no investment growth or shrinkage) has cost you \u00a3350 so your actual annuity rate is really more than double the stated level given the low cash amount you have paid.

When setting up the review last year, Baronness Blackstone described university careers services as \"often a Cinderella service, out on the remote edges of higher education, with little or no presence or influence in the lives of students\". </p> <p>This was certainly the experience of Marie, a postgraduate student at the LSE. \"I used the career services only once, thinking they could help me with a general understanding of the work scene.

With all the things they organise it's made really easy for you. What I've appreciated most is the chance to meet lots of different employers informally. It's helped me decide to go into finance rather than engineering and I've got a job fixed up for when I leave.\" </p> <p>If all the recommendations made in the Harris Report are put into place, Henry's experience will be the norm. The timetable is optimistic. Improvements are promised by the start of the academic year 2002/2003 at the latest, by which time all students should have access to a 'common core' of services. </p> <p>Which is good news for those who are currently missing out. Students on franchised courses have too often accepted the inevitability of not getting the same support as those at the parent institution. Peter Rankin, head of the University of Central Lancashire's careers service, welcomes the emphasis on equal entitlement for all. </p> <p>\"As a university that franchises many courses throughout Lancashire, Merseyside and Cumbria we've long been aware that distance creates problems for students at partner institutions. Although they can use all our facilities at Preston, it's not generally practical for them to do so. We started implementing solutions long before the Harris Report, but there's still some way to go before we could confidently say all our students receive the same level of careers guidance.\" </p> <p>Measures they've taken include training advisers in partner colleges and offering guidance by email. Rankin sees web-based resources as one means of providing equal services. \"Students at our main campus have had the option of taking credit-rated career management courses for several years but we've not been able to offer those to other students. Now we're working towards an online version which will, in time, be available to everyone associated with us.\" </p> <p>Jeff Goodman, a vice president of the Association of Graduate Careers Advisory Services (AGCAS) and director of the Careers Advisory Service at Bristol believes all university careers services do the best they can to help students move into rewarding work but acknowledges that some are better resourced than others. </p> <p>\"The term Cinderella service was not really accurate for my own university. We feel very much part of the institution, are well used and get positive feedback from students. But for institutions with fewer staff and resources providing what students need can be a real challenge.\" </p> <p>Looking at the websites of other services is one way of seeing whether you're getting your fair share of support. Manchester (<a href=\"http://www.netwise.ac.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.netwise.ac.uk</a>) and Bristol (<a href=\"http://www.cas.bris.ac.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.cas.bris.ac.uk</a>) provide open access to most of their information. Terry Dray says Netwise gets a surprising amount of use by students from other universities both in the UK and further afield. </p> <p>\"We're happy to see the site used by anyone who can benefit from it. We do have some extras such as mentoring and work experience schemes because we've bid for additional funds. </p> <p>\"However, the events we organise and the information we provide are the common core that students everywhere should have access to. Students who aren't happy with what their careers service is providing should learn to push a bit harder.\" </p> <p><strong> Helping advisers to help you</strong> </p> <p> Check what your service offers. The basics should include help with researching employers and career options, making applications, information on postgraduate study, recruitment fairs for vacation work as well as graduate jobs and vacancy notification services. Many offer much more. Make contact early - most services have events and resources that can help you right from your first year.</p>",

Peter Rankin, head of the University of Central Lancashire's careers service, welcomes the emphasis on equal entitlement for all. \"As a university that franchises many courses throughout Lancashire, Merseyside and Cumbria we've long been aware that distance creates problems for students at partner institutions. Although they can use all our facilities at Preston, it's not generally practical for them to do so. We started implementing solutions long before the Harris Report, but there's still some way to go before we could confidently say all our students receive the same level of careers guidance.\" Measures they've taken include training advisers in partner colleges and offering guidance by email. Rankin sees web-based resources as one means of providing equal services. \"Students at our main campus have had the option of taking credit-rated career management courses for several years but we've not been able to offer those to other students. Now we're working towards an online version which will, in time, be available to everyone associated with us.\" Jeff Goodman, a vice president of the Association of Graduate Careers Advisory Services (AGCAS) and director of the Careers Advisory Service at Bristol believes all university careers services do the best they can to help students move into rewarding work but acknowledges that some are better resourced than others. \"The term Cinderella service was not really accurate for my own university. We feel very much part of the institution, are well used and get positive feedback from students. But for institutions with fewer staff and resources providing what students need can be a real challenge.\" Looking at the websites of other services is one way of seeing whether you're getting your fair share of support. Manchester (www.netwise.ac.uk) and Bristol (www.cas.bris.ac.uk) provide open access to most of their information. Terry Dray says Netwise gets a surprising amount of use by students from other universities both in the UK and further afield. \"We're happy to see the site used by anyone who can benefit from it. We do have some extras such as mentoring and work experience schemes because we've bid for additional funds. \"However, the events we organise and the information we provide are the common core that students everywhere should have access to. Students who aren't happy with what their careers service is providing should learn to push a bit harder.\" Helping advisers to help you Check what your service offers. The basics should include help with researching employers and career options, making applications, information on postgraduate study, recruitment fairs for vacation work as well as graduate jobs and vacancy notification services. Many offer much more. Make contact early - most services have events and resources that can help you right from your first year.",
