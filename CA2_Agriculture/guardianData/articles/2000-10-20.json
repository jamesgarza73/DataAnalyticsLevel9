I speak fluent Geordie! ... \"divvent ye kna hinny!\" ... so Solano and Cordone seemed a little bemused ... haven't a clue what they're on about, either! Ah! Shearer! ... local lad! ... son of a sheet-metal worker ... we can't all be skilled ... I asked if he'd reconsider his international retirement in England's time of need ... but he gave me short shrift!

      "body": "<p>In football, getting a bad name has always been easier than losing one. Mud sticks and when you play for a club of Leeds United's family tree the stains don't always come out in the wash. Alan Smith, their tempestuous young striker, will be 20 next week and his critics would say it is time for him to start growing up or face the consequences. </p> <p>With every flailing lunge, every gnashing of his teeth and every acidic headline, Smith's notoriety is spreading all the time. And that is sad. Under David O'Leary's paternal hand he has been the best player at Elland Road this season, but he is still better known for the sharpness of his studs than his finishing. </p> <p>The danger is that, having dug his own hole, Smith could find himself in over his head. He seems to be nurturing his reputation as a throwback to Elland Road days of old with the loving care of a gardener tending his roses. With this spiky character around, the potential for trans-Pennine feuding when Leeds renew hostilities with Manchester United today will never be far removed from Old Trafford. </p> <p>Last season Smith was a key player in the infamous on-pitch rumble with Spurs and, in 20 appearances, he racked up more cards (five yellow, one red) than goals (four). After a summer operation to clear an ankle injury, the ratio is now more in his favour. But his prolific start to the season - eight goals and a call-up to the full England squad - has still incorporated a Champions League suspension and a sending-off for England Under-21s against Finland. </p> <p>With his blond locks and all-year tan, Smith would not look out of place in a boy band. Yet when he pulls on his boots he can be as crude as one of the Gallagher brothers. \"I just hate losing and that's what gets me into trouble. But I don't set out to get into bother - no one does,\" he says. </p> <p>\"Things happen and when you are out there you can get carried away. When I was sent off for the Under-21s I had been getting kicked and stamped on all night, and I just lashed out. It was stupid really. </p> <p>\"Sammy Lee took me to one side afterwards and said they were gunning for me because they recognised me as being dangerous. It's a compliment, I suppose, but at the time you don't see it that way. It's hard sometimes to keep your cool. It's in my mind now that people might be talking more about the bad things than the good things. </p> <p>\"The gaffer here has spoken to me a few times about it and, to be fair, he's shown a lot of faith in me. He told me about his experiences as a young lad and one of his games for the Republic of Ireland, when they were playing in South America, and he was getting lumps kicked out of him. I think he retaliated and was sent off. He said that he had learned from it and that I should too.\" </p> <p>It is easy to have preconceived ideas when you are meeting a footballer, especially a teenager who drives a top-of-the-range BMW. But sometimes they can surprise you with their humility. Off the field, Smith is nothing like the crabby individual that emerges every Saturday. </p> <p>He has an infectious effervescence for life and a deep affection for the game. \"He's one of the most lovely lads you could ever meet,\" says one of the ladies at Thorp Arch, the Leeds practice ground. And it is, indeed, easy to warm to him. You just cannot help but wince every time he goes in for a tackle. </p> <p>Like most teenagers, Smith also has a touch of self-righteous innocence about him. \"I've been scoring a few goals this season and doing quite well, but I've found that a lot of people have been taking away from my football. </p> <p>\"When we played Spurs this month there were seven goals and it was a great game, but one newspaper based their entire match report around me supposedly having a run-in with Ramon Vega all afternoon. If you asked any of the Spurs players I'm sure they would say I never went near him. But the media make stuff of it because of me. I couldn't really believe it. </p> <p>\"To be honest, I don't usually like doing the press. I would much rather keep myself to myself and let my football do the talking. I don't like going to the tabloids because they will turn it into something it isn't. They've done that to me before. </p> <p>\"We played against Sheffield Wednesday last season and afterwards I was in a rush to get away. Some paper asked me for an interview and, when I said I didn't have time, it was all over the tabloids the next day that I was arrogant because I wouldn't talk to them. </p> <p>\"It can be hurtful because they make you out as a bad person. Anyone who reads it has no reason not to believe it because they don't know what you're really like. You can get misunderstood.\" </p> <p>There should be no misunderstanding Smith's ability. Slight yet wiry, with pace and perception, he not only has the best positional sense of any Leeds striker since Joe Jordan but the calmness in front of goal that sets natural finishers apart from the rest. </p> <p>His form is one of the main reasons why a Leeds side cruelly depleted by injuries is heading a Champions League group featuring Barcelona and Milan, while at the same time remaining in contention of qualifying next time round. With the news yesterday that Michael Bridges will be out for six weeks, much rests on Smith's young shoulders. </p> <p>\"The lad drives me mad sometimes,\" says O'Leary. \"We have had big words and there are probably a few more to come. But it is wrong for people to think of him as arrogant. He's nothing like that at all. He is a good player and a nice lad.\" </p> <p>There are many ways in which Smith, for all the bone-crunching challenges, is also a true professional. Behind the scenes at Elland Road he is one of the most amenable players towards doing community work. In training he is usually one of the last off the pitch. And he is a teetotaller too. </p> <p>\"I've never been one for alcohol. All the way from being a lad it has never appealed to me.I know that might be unusual because, yeah, footballers do get a lot of free time. I enjoy a good night out but I always stick to the soft drinks. Drinking is just something I have never done.\" </p> <p>Smith still lives with his parents at the house in Rothwell where he grew up. His bedroom walls are covered with posters of David Batty and Vinnie Jones (who else?). He says being around his family and schoolfriends helps to keep his feet on the ground. Which, after all, is better than an opponent's ankle.</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Nobody who watched any of Nigel Winterburn's heart-pumping, fist-clenching 440 games for Arsenal would doubt that he would have run through a brick outhouse for the club. What has not been generally known until now is that, along with his former team-mates, he also leaped over hurdles and bounded over hoops for Arsenal as part of a new science, known as plymetrics, initiated by their manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger to build the players' explosive energy. </p> <p>Wenger also introduced food supplements and hired a chef so that the players' diets could be strictly regulated and monitored. All of which must have made Winterburn believe he had crossed London by Tardis when he arrived at cosy old West Ham, where dear old 'Arry Redknapp is more comfortable with the F-word than the F-plan. </p> <p>As a great old pro, of course, Winterburn, 37 in December, has taken it in his admittedly slowing stride. And though for the first time today, he will walk out for a West Ham-Arsenal scrap from the claret-and-blue corner, his Highbury memories will be locked away as securely as all the medals he earned in north London. </p> <p>The fixture, like most London derbies, has a history of bad blood, and much spilling of it, last year's game at Upton Park descending to gutter level when Arsenal's Patrick Vieira was shown a red card and showered Neil Ruddock with spittle on the way off. Winterburn will not be surprised if the rules are again less adhered to than they were expected to be in this morning's Mike Tyson-Andrew Golota fight. </p> <p>He says: \"As you can imagine, I looked up the date of this match as soon as the fixture list came out. I'm not expecting too many problems from my old Arsenal pals, but if it does kick up a bit rough, I will still be the first to offer a handshake at the end. </p> <p>\"I've always said that it is only a game of football but, while you're out on that pitch for 90 minutes, it's more or less your life, and fans want to see that, they want to see you getting stuck in and working hard. At the end, though, all the players should be man enough to shake hands.\" </p> <p>For a man renowned for his bulging-eyeballs style and goalscoring celebrations that could get him a place in an American relay squad, Winterburn is quite philosophical on the quiet. One might expect him to harbour resentment against Arsenal, where he had hoped to finish his career, or at least demonstrate only sulky acceptance of playing out his days at West Ham. Yet he says: \"I would never change anything I've had or anything I've got. When I look back and remember being shown the door as a kid at Birmingham City and look where I am now, I really haven't got much to grumble about. </p> <p>\"I had a choice in the summer: to stay at Arsenal for sentimental reasons or come here and play regularly. Once I came to the conclusion that I couldn't live without playing, the decision was easy. And I'm fully committed to West Ham. Otherwise, I wouldn't have joined, I would have packed the game in.\" </p> <p>Winterburn had long known that a cocky young kid with a wicked left foot would one day bound into Arsenal's marble halls and work happily as his apprentice for a year or two before showing his gratitude by seizing the shirt off his dressing-room peg.

      "bodyText": "Nobody who watched any of Nigel Winterburn's heart-pumping, fist-clenching 440 games for Arsenal would doubt that he would have run through a brick outhouse for the club. What has not been generally known until now is that, along with his former team-mates, he also leaped over hurdles and bounded over hoops for Arsenal as part of a new science, known as plymetrics, initiated by their manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger to build the players' explosive energy. Wenger also introduced food supplements and hired a chef so that the players' diets could be strictly regulated and monitored. All of which must have made Winterburn believe he had crossed London by Tardis when he arrived at cosy old West Ham, where dear old 'Arry Redknapp is more comfortable with the F-word than the F-plan. As a great old pro, of course, Winterburn, 37 in December, has taken it in his admittedly slowing stride. And though for the first time today, he will walk out for a West Ham-Arsenal scrap from the claret-and-blue corner, his Highbury memories will be locked away as securely as all the medals he earned in north London. The fixture, like most London derbies, has a history of bad blood, and much spilling of it, last year's game at Upton Park descending to gutter level when Arsenal's Patrick Vieira was shown a red card and showered Neil Ruddock with spittle on the way off. Winterburn will not be surprised if the rules are again less adhered to than they were expected to be in this morning's Mike Tyson-Andrew Golota fight. He says: \"As you can imagine, I looked up the date of this match as soon as the fixture list came out. I'm not expecting too many problems from my old Arsenal pals, but if it does kick up a bit rough, I will still be the first to offer a handshake at the end. \"I've always said that it is only a game of football but, while you're out on that pitch for 90 minutes, it's more or less your life, and fans want to see that, they want to see you getting stuck in and working hard. At the end, though, all the players should be man enough to shake hands.\" For a man renowned for his bulging-eyeballs style and goalscoring celebrations that could get him a place in an American relay squad, Winterburn is quite philosophical on the quiet. One might expect him to harbour resentment against Arsenal, where he had hoped to finish his career, or at least demonstrate only sulky acceptance of playing out his days at West Ham. Yet he says: \"I would never change anything I've had or anything I've got. When I look back and remember being shown the door as a kid at Birmingham City and look where I am now, I really haven't got much to grumble about. \"I had a choice in the summer: to stay at Arsenal for sentimental reasons or come here and play regularly. Once I came to the conclusion that I couldn't live without playing, the decision was easy. And I'm fully committed to West Ham. Otherwise, I wouldn't have joined, I would have packed the game in.\" Winterburn had long known that a cocky young kid with a wicked left foot would one day bound into Arsenal's marble halls and work happily as his apprentice for a year or two before showing his gratitude by seizing the shirt off his dressing-room peg. When Winterburn observed the Brazilian brilliance of Silvinho in training, he knew the future had arrived. He says: \"Trying to be friendly to someone and at the same time trying to keep them out of the team takes a special mentality. That's what I was trying to do - to stop it for as long as possible and make it as difficult for him as possible. But he is a very good player, and his forward play, the quickness of his feet, is fantastic.\" West Ham, remarkably, have yet to win at home, though despite facing an Arsenal side unbeaten in Europe or the Premiership since the opening day - a 1-0 defeat to Sunderland - Winterburn is confident today could be one when they blow away reputations rather than bubbles. The Hammers rounded off a tremendous performance against Manchester United at Upton Park with two goals in the final four minutes to secure a draw, and came from behind to get a point against a Liverpool side who were content to escape with one. Winterburn says that they could easily have won both games, while conceding, surely proof that he is now fully versed in the capriciousness of life at West Ham, that they almost threw both away. He does not linger on such things, any more than he lingers on the incomprehensible fact that, in an era when England can barely find a player to stand on his left foot, let alone kick with it, he has only two caps.

For one thing no one was here at the start. It was like the beginning of the opening Test in 1987-88, in Lahore, where only 150 could be counted. And one of the umpires yesterday was Shakeel Khan.

This match, and then one against Pakistan A on the same ground tomorrow, are merely acclimatisation. </p> <p> England's batting was ultimately awesome. It was shaped by Trescothick, who straight-drove Mohammad Akram for a muscular four in the first over. Trescothick made 66 on his Test debut and 79 in his first one-day international, so little, not even a new country, is likely to faze him. Here he found a pitch even flatter than his beloved Taunton and he thrived on it. </p> <p> Until he tired in the 29th over, when he top-edged an attempted sweep to short fine leg, he drove and pulled - sometimes off the front foot - until the bowlers despaired. He faced 93 balls and there were three sixes and a dozen fours. </p> <p> He put on 41 for the first wicket with Alec Stewart (17) and then 126 for the second with Nasser Hussain (44).

Hick did not turn up until the 29th over; Andrew Flintoff did not arrive until the 42nd.</p> <p> These are the mightiest strikers of all.

      "body": "<p>Hopes that interest rates would remain at 6% for the rest of the year were raised yesterday by news of a slowdown in economic growth. </p> <p>Weaker activity in the services sector trimmed the pace of growth in the third quarter of this year, but it stayed above its long-term average. </p> <p>Provisional data published by the office for national statistics showed GDP grew by 0.7% between July and September compared to the previous three months and was up by 2.9% over the year. </p> <p>In the second quarter, the corresponding figures were 0.9% and 3.2%. </p> <p>The slowdown was concentrated in the services sector, where output expanded by 0.7% in the quarter and 3.3% over the year, down from 0.9% and 3.5% in the second quarter. </p> <p>After shrinking at the turn of the year, manufacturing recorded its second successive quarter of growth, although the ONS was unable to say by how much because of incomplete data. Philip Shaw, economist at Investec in the City, said that judging by the slowdown in services, manufacturing output probably accelerated to 0.6% from 0.4%. </p> <p>\"Certain areas of the sector, notably technology oriented firms, do seem to be thriving,\" he said. \"However we would shy away from inferring that the economy as a whole is well balanced and instead remain of the view that the strength of sterling against the euro keeps alive the dangers of a two-speed economy.\" </p> <p>The figures, which were in line with expectations in the City, gave ammunition to both sides of the interest rates debate. </p> <p>Jonathan Loynes, of Capital Economics, said they would come as a relief to hawks on the Bank of England's monetary policy committee and meant that the cost of borrowing, on hold for the last eight months, had peaked at 6%. </p> <p>But Geoff Dicks, of the Royal Bank of Scotland, pointed out that despite the slowdown, the economy was still growing above trend, reckoned to be about 0.6% a quarter or 2.5% a year, and putting upward pressure on capacity and inflation. According to his estimate, output is running at 1% above its assessed maximum. </p> <p>Mr Shaw said the underlying strength of demand remained too strong to prevent one more quarter-point increase in rates, although he added that sterling's strength on the foreign exchanges probably meant it would be delayed until early next year. </p> <p>The only thing that could spoil that relatively benign scenario would be a major pre-election giveaway by the chancellor Gordon Brown. </p> <p>The ONS said the British economy has now had 33 successive quarters of growth since the bottom of the last recession in the second quarter of 1992, a post-war record. </p> <p>Since then, GDP has grown by 27%, service sector output by 34% and manufacturing output by nearly 12%. </p> <p>Previously, the longest expansion lasted 24 quarters from the third quarter of 1984 to the second quarter of 1990.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Hopes that interest rates would remain at 6% for the rest of the year were raised yesterday by news of a slowdown in economic growth. Weaker activity in the services sector trimmed the pace of growth in the third quarter of this year, but it stayed above its long-term average. Provisional data published by the office for national statistics showed GDP grew by 0.7% between July and September compared to the previous three months and was up by 2.9% over the year. In the second quarter, the corresponding figures were 0.9% and 3.2%. The slowdown was concentrated in the services sector, where output expanded by 0.7% in the quarter and 3.3% over the year, down from 0.9% and 3.5% in the second quarter. After shrinking at the turn of the year, manufacturing recorded its second successive quarter of growth, although the ONS was unable to say by how much because of incomplete data. Philip Shaw, economist at Investec in the City, said that judging by the slowdown in services, manufacturing output probably accelerated to 0.6% from 0.4%. \"Certain areas of the sector, notably technology oriented firms, do seem to be thriving,\" he said. \"However we would shy away from inferring that the economy as a whole is well balanced and instead remain of the view that the strength of sterling against the euro keeps alive the dangers of a two-speed economy.\" The figures, which were in line with expectations in the City, gave ammunition to both sides of the interest rates debate. Jonathan Loynes, of Capital Economics, said they would come as a relief to hawks on the Bank of England's monetary policy committee and meant that the cost of borrowing, on hold for the last eight months, had peaked at 6%. But Geoff Dicks, of the Royal Bank of Scotland, pointed out that despite the slowdown, the economy was still growing above trend, reckoned to be about 0.6% a quarter or 2.5% a year, and putting upward pressure on capacity and inflation. According to his estimate, output is running at 1% above its assessed maximum. Mr Shaw said the underlying strength of demand remained too strong to prevent one more quarter-point increase in rates, although he added that sterling's strength on the foreign exchanges probably meant it would be delayed until early next year. The only thing that could spoil that relatively benign scenario would be a major pre-election giveaway by the chancellor Gordon Brown. The ONS said the British economy has now had 33 successive quarters of growth since the bottom of the last recession in the second quarter of 1992, a post-war record. Since then, GDP has grown by 27%, service sector output by 34% and manufacturing output by nearly 12%. Previously, the longest expansion lasted 24 quarters from the third quarter of 1984 to the second quarter of 1990.",

Klein said bitterly that the city got the book it deserved. </p> <p>Klein's then-original techniques are now commonplace but he has lost none of his edge. His latest film is a quasi-documentary about Handel's Messiah, in which the oratorio is paired with a startling array of images, from gamblers in Las Vegas and a passion play in Andalusia, to the antics of Bodybuilders for Christ, who crumple aluminium pans as easily as you or I would crush a piece of card. At times images set themselves in ironic opposition to the music, and crucially the libretto. \"Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the world,\" for instance, is paired with shots of the Dallas police department flicking through mugshots of criminals. \"Rejoice greatly\" sees Christmas celebrations in a hostel for the homeless in Paris, where baffled, putty-faced derelicts plod round the dancefloor as stiffly as marionettes. </p> <p>At other times, the ecstatic metaphor of the text is reduced to the concrete in disturbing fashion. \"The crooked shall be made straight\" sees the scene move from a rocky valley to a New York cityscape, where gleaming, silvery skyscrapers stand bolt upright like mercury in a thermometer. </p> <p>The film would be cheaper if it were pure satire. It is not. It is also celebratory. The good news told by neon signs and advertising hoardings is certainly not the good news of Handel's oratorio - but through Klein's lens these altars to Mammon take on their own wild beauty. Klein also knows when to let the music - as powerful and uplifting a score as has ever been written - slip away from the condition of soundtrack and come to the fore.

However, despite their protestations, there is something terminally indie, hippy and indeed drippy about them. </p> <p>They follow their raucous entrance with the kind of Corrs-like niceness that presumably prompted the insult. They even have a song called Hippy Thinking. Former record company workers disillusioned with the industry, they subsequently proved they can take it on at its own game.

The album's grooves make fleeting appearances, but there's something problematic about Jo's Sandy Denny voice.

In Jamaica, particularly, your batty is your bottom, and artistic director Jawole Zollar's defiant, triumphal piece appeals to all \"big mamas\" to accept and proclaim their curves. You won't hear these women asking: \"Does my bum look big in this?\" It probably does and they don't care. </p> <p>An infectious mix of ballet, contemporary and African tribal moves, with juddering shoulders to focus on the breasts, and every permutation of gyration imaginable to show off the rear, Batty Moves is introduced by Afro-Cuban Carolina Garcia, a pint-sized powerhouse who fuses Latino rhythms with traditional African steps, wickedly poking fun at thrusting bad girl rappers. The women form a chorus line, T-shirts tied round their waists, and waggle their bums every which way. After being joined by singer Topaz Wise, who makes Rubens's models look undernourished, the women strut their stuff in sassy solos extolling their virtues and vices. </p> <p>Physically punishing, the choreography switches from fast and flashy to bump-andgrind erotic, and the whole thing is one huge girls' night out. We clapped and whooped and ululated and wanted to jump on the stage. </p> <p>In contrast, Shelter was a sober look at how we could all find ourselves, as the poet put it, between a rock and a hard place. The dancers portray street women who live on squares of cardboard, explode in bursts of desperation, huddle together for comfort and obsessively flick off unseen dirt. The piece is accompanied by sizzling percussion from Michael Wimberly and Wise's huge voice. </p> <p>Garcia was also superb in the poignant solo Give Your Hands, raging against the machine, her hands clenched in fists of anger, open to soothe and heal, or reaching out to struggle until reposed in final peace. </p> <p> Final performance tonight.

They have a vested interest - commission. </p> <p>Supporters of investment trust pensions say the combination of low running costs and flexible management with a route to the potentially high returns offered by the world's stock markets gives them an edge. </p> <p>A personal pension plan is simply a wrapper for an investment which offers certain tax benefits while the planholder is saving up for retirement. </p> <p>A wide variety of assets can go into the wrapper - with-profits funds, property, bonds, cash, shares in unquoted companies or overseas stocks. Investment trusts are a further category with five major groups - AIB Govett, Alliance, Edinburgh Fund Managers, Fleming, and Foreign &amp; Colonial all offering off-the-peg schemes. </p> <p>Pension buyers can put other trusts into bespoke plans known as self-invested personal pensions. But the five with their own schemes offer low, transparent costs. </p> <p>Nick Perryman of the independent financial adviser Douglas Deakin Young says: \"They are wonderfully low cost and perform well, especially over the longer term.\" </p> <p>If you get past the complexities of investment trusts you can enjoy the combination of low charges and flexibility, coupled with the pension tax allowance. Typically, a fund will charge a \u00a3200 upfront fee, a \u00a350 administration charge and a 0.5% annual management charge. This compares with standard pension management charges that range from 1.5% to 5%. The Fleming Pension Account, run by Chase Fleming Asset Management, has no upfront charges, and a 0.5% annual management fee. The costs even compare favourably with the stakeholder pension which limits annual management charges to 1%. </p> <p>Investment trusts find it harder to match other stakeholder requirements, however. The government says stakeholder pensions should accept monthly payments as low as \u00a320 a month. Edinburgh Fund Managers demands minimum payments of \u00a350 a month, \u00a3500 annually or a \u00a31,000 lump sum. It says the minimum figures are being looked at in the light of the stakeholder rules but no decision has been taken yet. </p> <p>Mr Perryman points out that many investment trusts also fail to offer a \"waiver of premium\" that allows investors to reduce or skip payments should they become sick or temporarily out of work. This is also true of some standard personal pensions as well. </p> <p>Lesley Drummond at Edinburgh maintains that most investment trusts offer greater flexibility, with fully managed and other funds available. \"You can start with the managed fund and once you've got used to the way it works you can switch to the selector fund with any additional cost,\" she says. </p> <p>Once inside the pension wrapper, the same rules apply to investment trust pensions as any other type of personal pension when it comes to taking retirement. Investors must take their money out between the ages of 50 and 75 and purchase an annuity that will give a fixed income until death. </p> <p>\u0095You can read more at the Chase Fleming Asset Management website, <a href=\"http://www.chaseflemingam.co.uk\">www.chaseflemingam.co.uk;</a> Edinburgh Fund Managers at <a href=\"http://www.edfd.com\">www.edfd.com;</a> and Foreign &amp; Colonial at <a href=\"http://www.fandc.co.uk\">www.fandc.co.uk. </a> </p> <p>AITC publishes a free factsheet on investment trust pensions, which is available on 0800 707 707.</p>",

A wide variety of assets can go into the wrapper - with-profits funds, property, bonds, cash, shares in unquoted companies or overseas stocks. Investment trusts are a further category with five major groups - AIB Govett, Alliance, Edinburgh Fund Managers, Fleming, and Foreign &amp; Colonial all offering off-the-peg schemes. Pension buyers can put other trusts into bespoke plans known as self-invested personal pensions. But the five with their own schemes offer low, transparent costs. Nick Perryman of the independent financial adviser Douglas Deakin Young says: \"They are wonderfully low cost and perform well, especially over the longer term.\" If you get past the complexities of investment trusts you can enjoy the combination of low charges and flexibility, coupled with the pension tax allowance. Typically, a fund will charge a \u00a3200 upfront fee, a \u00a350 administration charge and a 0.5% annual management charge. This compares with standard pension management charges that range from 1.5% to 5%. The Fleming Pension Account, run by Chase Fleming Asset Management, has no upfront charges, and a 0.5% annual management fee. The costs even compare favourably with the stakeholder pension which limits annual management charges to 1%. Investment trusts find it harder to match other stakeholder requirements, however. The government says stakeholder pensions should accept monthly payments as low as \u00a320 a month. Edinburgh Fund Managers demands minimum payments of \u00a350 a month, \u00a3500 annually or a \u00a31,000 lump sum. It says the minimum figures are being looked at in the light of the stakeholder rules but no decision has been taken yet. Mr Perryman points out that many investment trusts also fail to offer a \"waiver of premium\" that allows investors to reduce or skip payments should they become sick or temporarily out of work. This is also true of some standard personal pensions as well. Lesley Drummond at Edinburgh maintains that most investment trusts offer greater flexibility, with fully managed and other funds available. \"You can start with the managed fund and once you've got used to the way it works you can switch to the selector fund with any additional cost,\" she says. Once inside the pension wrapper, the same rules apply to investment trust pensions as any other type of personal pension when it comes to taking retirement. Investors must take their money out between the ages of 50 and 75 and purchase an annuity that will give a fixed income until death. \u0095You can read more at the Chase Fleming Asset Management website, www.chaseflemingam.co.uk; Edinburgh Fund Managers at www.edfd.com; and Foreign &amp; Colonial at www.fandc.co.uk.

      "body": "<p>Britain's lenders spend, at a conservative estimate, tens of millions persuading people to borrow. But Britain's money advice centres have just a tiny percentage of that sum to deal with the ravages of problem debt: relationship break-ups, bad health, homelessness or suicide. </p> <p>This week the government hauled in banks, credit card companies and other lenders to a \"debt summit\" in a bid to call a halt to \"irresponsible loans\". </p> <p>The Department of Trade and Industry is concerned at the ease with which credit is made available and the lack of checks on the ability of borrowers to repay. But while the move is welcome, it will do little to ease queues outside money advice centres. </p> <p>This week, Jobs &amp; Money went to see the reality of Britain's growing debt difficulties, spending a day with money advice worker Linda Mullholland, in Bristol. Linda, 43, is a gamekeeper turned poacher. After her two children were born, she took a part-time job chasing debtors for consumer loan company Welbeck Finance. </p> <p>\"I felt the work was immoral. I spent most of my time after people persuaded into borrowing when they had little hope of repaying if they suffered the slightest mishap. I was told to squeeze blood out of stone,\" she says. </p> <p>She started with the Bristol Debt Advice Centre (BDAC) in 1990 as a volunteer. Now she works four days a week. </p> <p> <strong> 9.00 am :</strong> Her day starts at the BDAC office in run-down Easton - a far cry from the luxury homes in Clifton, waterside warehouse conversions and new financial sector offices that Bristol prefers to show the world. </p> <p> <strong> 9.30am:</strong> She motors to her destination for the morning's outreach work on a 1940s council estate. Knowle West has the unenviable twin reputations of being the poverty and heroin capital of the south-west. In Knowle West she holds a once a week session in the Filwood Hope drop-in advice centre, a local churches-backed project surrounded by boarded-up shops, a bookie's and a sweetshop where the goods are kept behind security screens. </p> <p> <strong> 10.15am:</strong> Her first customer is Alison Wilson. Until recently, Alison, husband Jimmy and their three children had been keeping their financial heads above water. Now they owe nearly \u00a37,000, mostly to the Inland Revenue but also to Lloyds-TSB, and consumer loans. </p> <p>The family's problem stems from self-employed builder Jimmy's back injury. After seven months on a hospital waiting list he had a disc removed. But he is unable to work and may never do so again. Alison is studying to be a nursery nurse but will qualify late next year. </p> <p>The family lives on \u00a3135 per week income support and \u00a335 per week child benefit, a total of \u00a3166 a week or \u00a34.74 per person per day. Their rent, community charge and school meals are paid for. They have no savings, so offering to pay a proportion of the debts is impossible. </p> <p> <strong> 10.45am:</strong> After outlining her problems, Alison says her husband thinks bankruptcy could be a way out. But Linda Mullholland knows the Wilsons cannot afford bankruptcy fees, normally \u00a3370, but cut to \u00a3250 for those on income support. \"There is no point in offering anything, as we have nothing. Going bust would make a fresh start,\" says Alison. </p> <p>But Linda warns her that this action would still leave her - as opposed to Jimmy - with bank consumer loan debts. However, she thinks a court would probably order repayment at \u00a31 a month. </p> <p>The \u00a3250 bankruptcy fee is a real stumbling block. But until they can find it, Linda will write to the family's creditors telling them what is likely to happen. </p> <p>Finance companies will be less likely to waste time and money chasing the Wilsons if they know Jimmy is petitioning for bankruptcy. But Alison is worried about bailliffs. Linda reassures her. She says: \"They're not interested in normal furniture or in your broken-down van. Nor will the official receiver waste time and money pursuing you. Just make sure you do not get left money or win the National Lottery.\" </p> <p>She tells her about Yorkshire Building Society's Cash Transactor which gives undischarged bankrupts a basic account provided they can find \u00a325. </p> <p> <strong> 11.30am:</strong> Alison says she feels \"a bit happier, a bit lighter. I won't panic if the Inland Revenue sends heavy letters. This service is brilliant - you can never get through on the phone. Our whole life is having to change. But if we can start again, we could make a go.\" </p> <p> <strong> 11.45am:</strong> Linda meets Debbie Jones, 23, and eight month son Trent. Debbie has two part-time jobs and her husband, Darren, 29, is in full-time work although recent cut backs have slashed his overtime. They both have bank accounts. </p> <p> <strong> 12.00pm:</strong> Debbie's big worry is being threatened with a fine for not paying the TV licence. But it is clear there are multiple problems - they owe rent, their working families tax credit book has been impounded for a \"scanning check\", their phone is cut off, they're behind with water payments and buy gas and electricity expensively through pre-payment meters. </p> <p>And Linda discovers more \"forgotten\" debts. They owe Darren's mum \u00a3290. They are behind on cash owed to door-to-door lenders Provident Financial and \u00a3579 to credit company HFC. The Social Fund is still after Darren for a 1993 debt. He also owes the taxman nearly \u00a33,000 from the same period. Including benefits, the family has \u00a3265 a week coming in. They are being threatened with eviction for rent arrears. </p> <p> <strong> 12.10pm:</strong> Linda phones the council housing department to see how near the family is to losing their home. She fails to find the right official. </p> <p> <strong> 12.15pm:</strong> Although Debbie is still talking about Christmas and birthday presents, she now realises how serious her position is. \"The eviction is the big number one priority. The consumer loans and the Inland Revenue are way down the list,\" says Linda. </p> <p> <strong> 12.30pm:</strong> Debbie admits to having only a vague idea of the family's weekly spending. With Linda's help, she draws up a statement of income and expenditure - essential if Linda is to persuade creditors to reduce their demands. </p> <p> <strong> 12.45pm:</strong> The family could, Linda calculates, afford to pay \u00a325 a week off their loans. She says she will write to tell creditors. She sets up a plan of action but it will cost \u00a350 to remove the eviction warrant from the court. Debbie promises to take cash to the rent office as soon as Darren gets paid. She is told about Easicash, a Post Office plan to help with TV licence arrears. She gets a helpline number if bailiffs appear. </p> <p> <strong> 1.30pm:</strong> Returns to the office with a sandwich grabbed from behind the security grille at the local baker. </p> <p> <strong> 2.00pm:</strong> She chases the council again to get Debbie's eviction forestalled. </p> <p> <strong> 2.15pm:</strong> She starts to work on writing to Alison's creditors - a mix of standard letters and individual pleadings. \"I give them 14 days to get back. Otherwise I chase them. One client had 27 creditors. Creditors can be more reasonable if you explain what's happening. They won't want to waste money on unrecoverable debts.\" </p> <p> <strong> 2.45pm:</strong> She faxes the benefits agency to get a client on Fuel Direct so gas and electricity payments are paid out of income support. </p> <p> <strong> 3.15pm:</strong> Linda finally gets through to the council about Debbie's eviction. It is closer than anyone feared. She starts to try to stop it with offers of a firm payment later that week and court action to remove the warrant. </p> <p> <strong> 3.45pm:</strong> Phones Charter Trust, a hire purchase firm threatening to repossess a car. The client is six months in arrears, amounting to some \u00a3840. But the car will fetch little. She hopes an offer of \u00a3100 a month will suffice. They promise to get back to her. </p> <p> <strong> 4.15pm:</strong> Phones a client threatened with eviction by the council. She had already arranged one rescheduling of this debt. The client only has a temporary tenancy, over which the courts have no discretion. So it is down to pleading on her behalf. \"She has mental health difficulties. Maybe she paid the money into the wrong account,\" says Linda. </p> <p> All client names have been changed</p>",

Soaring leg work jolts to a stop as a man pulls a leery grimace; classical footwork segues into tap, and alienated solos resolve into couple dances. </p> <p>The piece is a marathon for its dancers, and you have to admire the skill and stamina they bring to it. But while Miller is never short of a step, she seems to have no vision of where the material is heading: the dancing just carries on noisily and furiously until the music stops. There is no powerful architecture to contain it, no atmosphere for it to resonate in, and no persuasive underlying rhythm to carry us through. </p> <p>In the 1997 piece Four for Nothing, which Miller made for her current Freiburg-based company, the stage is filled with lyric, athletic dance in the style of Paul Taylor. Let loose among it, though, is a hyperactive narrator who wanders between the dancers gabbling a stream of facts and quotations. Sometimes he takes refuge in a small orange wigwam in the middle of the floor; sometimes he drags around some extraneous props. Miller gives us old- fashioned dancerly order rubbing up against postmodern disorder but, as in Pretty Ugly, this play of opposites doesn't add up to much that's new. </p> <p>By far the most impressive work of the evening is Meidosems, a duet set to music for prepared piano by John Cage. The score has a sibylline oriental quality, which Miller wonderfully re-creates in her movement, especially the choreography for the female role (performed by ex-Royal Ballet dancer Deborah Jones). </p> <p>Within a virtuoso sweep of dance, Jones articulates exquisite calligraphic detail, odd serendipitous gestures, and a kind of crabbed, archaic style of footwork. </p> <p>It's a genuinely thrilling chemistry between choreographer and performer, and it makes the work seem huge.

His introversion, he insists, is partly professional: batsmen are meant to be self-contained and poker-faced. </p> <p>There are people, however, and people who should know him well, for whom this appears a rather glib explanation; they have questioned his attitude. </p> <p>Mike Gatting, when a Test selector, said Thorpe \"brought nothing to the table bar runs\". And last year the former England coach David Lloyd used words such as \"surly\", \"divisive\" and \"nonconformist\" to describe the man who, for most of the 90s, was England's premier middle- order batsman. </p> <p>This is also the man who was fined by the England management for not turning up at a pre-World Cup bash for Kent members, who has not always observed the team dress code and was one of those criticised for adopting a negative attitude when England toured Zimbabwe in 1996-97. He chose not to tour last winter and was not awarded a central contract last year. </p> <p>Then there is his playing record. It started brilliantly, with an unbeaten century on his Test debut against Australia at Trent Bridge. But it is now two years since his latest Test fifty. In 1999 he scored only 93 in six knocks against New Zealand and last year his best was 46 against West Indies. </p> <p>So in Pakistan and Sri Lanka this winter he has much to prove. On the field and off it. Off it he could scarcely look more relaxed, whether he is lounging in the pool or playing table tennis with team-mates who, incidentally, swear by him rather than at him. </p> <p>\"I feel completely different,\" he said. \"My whole attitude towards the game has changed. The pressures I used to feel within the game are not as big as they used to be. I don't have a fear of failing and because I've been away from the England side I know that my life away from cricket is going along quite nicely. </p> <p>\"I am still dependent on the game financially, but not emotionally. I felt a couple of years ago that I was playing big cricket, big cricket non-stop. Some of the enjoyment went out of it. But that is no longer the case. And I'm aware of the fact that I'm 31 and want to win as much as I can.\" </p> <p>He feels hopeful about matters on the field too. \"The decks are pretty good out here. We were here four years ago for the World Cup so we know a little bit about the conditions. Basically, the pitches don't seam. Maybe a little bit in the morning. </p> <p>\"There is the problem of reverse swing to negotiate. I am trying to open my stance a little so I don't find my front pad planted down the middle of the pitch and have to play round it. I am trying to play more of the ball. The thing is, Pakistan are firm favourites and they have this extremely talented attack with great variation. When you're up against that quality you're never really in.\" </p> <p>He refused to answer the real question: how do you play Saqlain Mushtaq, one of the world's two leading off-spinners, whose repertoire also includes a fierce leggie which he unleashes with no discernible change in action. After all, Thorpe and Saqlain have shared the dressing room at the Oval since 1997. </p> <p>\"He averages about 14 runs a wicket for us and I'm full of admiration. But I'm not going to say whether I can pick him or not. Even if I could, picking a bowler and playing him are two different things. </p> <p>\"There are batsmen who say they can pick Shane Warne's flipper but who still get into trouble against it. If I said I can play Saqlain and then put my foot in it first ball I would look very foolish. So I'm saying nothing, except that we will discuss him before the matches. </p> <p>\"He's one of those who make the game look very easy. He plays it the way I might play club cricket.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Andrew Flintoff's future as a Test all-rounder looks bleaker than ever with the news that he will return to England after the one-day series against Pakistan and play no Test cricket this winter. </p> <p>The Lancashire player is suffering from a recurrence of his spinal problems and has been unable to meet the management's pre-tour condition that he must be fit enough to bowl in the three-Test series against Pakistan. He will be replaced by Surrey's Alex Tudor. </p> <p>Flintoff, 22, may be back in England colours after Christmas for the one-day matches in Sri Lanka but will not be considered for the three Test matches in that country. </p> <p>He bowled in the nets here on Tuesday but, because of that, was unable to bowl on Wednesday or yesterday. The management made their decision at a meeting at the team hotel on Wednesday evening. </p> <p>The coach Duncan Fletcher, who in the past has been disappointed with the player's attitude and weight problems, made it clear that the decision to send him home was based on fitness alone. </p> <p>\"He's pretty disappointed,\" Fletcher said. \"But he knew all along that he would have to be able to bowl. Every cricket side is looking for an all-rounder and England have been looking for some time. Freddie would have been a very effective all-rounder. </p> <p>\"He now faces a very difficult decision. Does he have an operation? Or does he leave it, in which case it might be two or three years before he can bowl again? If you don't bowl for that length of time you lose a lot of experience. </p> <p>\"I think, in time, he could be a very good batter. I just think sometimes he gets confused how to play the game. He's such an exciting player; he can take any attack apart. But he doesn't know when to defend and when to attack.\" </p> <p>Flintoff's problem has baffled specialists, more of whom he will meet on his return to England. He is suffering the symptoms of a stress fracture but there is no stress fracture per se . When he bowls he suffers pain in his lower back, on the left side of his spine. </p> <p>\"For such a young man there are parts of his spine that are very weak and worn,\" says Dean Conway, the tour physio. \"There is scar tissue and some evidence of stress fractures when he was 16 or 17. The trouble is there is nothing clear-cut. He has had injections and now maybe there is a case for surgery. But I still think we could one day have him running in as he did in South Africa last winter.\" </p> <p>Flintoff was the last England cricketer to be handed the poisoned chalice that identified him as the successor to Ian Botham. He was never going to fill those oversized boots but his potential, like his size, is immense. He is a spectacular striker of a cricket ball and, when fit, can generate real pace from a short run-up. </p> <p>For brute strength he is more than a match for Botham. But the skill will probably never measure up, and the fitness and stamina certainly never will. </p> <p>Flintoff made his Test debut in the 1998 home series against South Africa and scored a half-century on his one-day international debut, against Pakistan in Sharjah the following year. Last winter he played in England's first four Tests in South Africa but was flown home after suffering a stress fracture of the left foot during the Cape Town Test. </p> <p>He appeared in the first three Tests of this summer before more back trouble caused him to miss the remaining Tests, and he played as a specialist batsman in the inaugural NatWest Series. </p> <p>Last summer, however, it was an injury to his pride which he found most painful. The England management, disappointed by his easy-going attitude, revealed that he weighed 17st 12lb - heavier than Lennox Lewis. His England team-mates called him FS, standing for Fat Slogger. And even when he played well he was greeted by such tabloid headlines as \"Praise the Lard\". </p> <p>Since then he has trained well and lost weight. The fat-boy jokes have dried up. This morning there is something more serious to discuss. A considerable talent has reached a career crisis point. </p> <p>\u0095 Pakistan's squad for Tuesday's first one-day international against England includes four spinners - Shahid Afridi, Mushtaq Ahmed, Shoaib Malik and Saqlain Mushtaq - but there is no place for the experienced batsman Ijaz Ahmed. </p> <p><strong>Pakistan squad:</strong> Moin Khan (capt), Inzamam-ul-Haq, Saeed Anwar, Salim Elahi, Imran Nazir, Shahid Afridi, Yousuf Youhana, Faisal Iqbal, Wasim Akram, Waqar Younis, Abdur Razzaq, Azhar Mahmood, Saqlain Mushtaq, Mushtaq Ahmad, Shoaib Malik.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Andrew Flintoff's future as a Test all-rounder looks bleaker than ever with the news that he will return to England after the one-day series against Pakistan and play no Test cricket this winter. The Lancashire player is suffering from a recurrence of his spinal problems and has been unable to meet the management's pre-tour condition that he must be fit enough to bowl in the three-Test series against Pakistan. He will be replaced by Surrey's Alex Tudor. Flintoff, 22, may be back in England colours after Christmas for the one-day matches in Sri Lanka but will not be considered for the three Test matches in that country. He bowled in the nets here on Tuesday but, because of that, was unable to bowl on Wednesday or yesterday. The management made their decision at a meeting at the team hotel on Wednesday evening. The coach Duncan Fletcher, who in the past has been disappointed with the player's attitude and weight problems, made it clear that the decision to send him home was based on fitness alone. \"He's pretty disappointed,\" Fletcher said. \"But he knew all along that he would have to be able to bowl. Every cricket side is looking for an all-rounder and England have been looking for some time. Freddie would have been a very effective all-rounder. \"He now faces a very difficult decision. Does he have an operation? Or does he leave it, in which case it might be two or three years before he can bowl again? If you don't bowl for that length of time you lose a lot of experience. \"I think, in time, he could be a very good batter. I just think sometimes he gets confused how to play the game. He's such an exciting player; he can take any attack apart. But he doesn't know when to defend and when to attack.\" Flintoff's problem has baffled specialists, more of whom he will meet on his return to England. He is suffering the symptoms of a stress fracture but there is no stress fracture per se . When he bowls he suffers pain in his lower back, on the left side of his spine. \"For such a young man there are parts of his spine that are very weak and worn,\" says Dean Conway, the tour physio. \"There is scar tissue and some evidence of stress fractures when he was 16 or 17. The trouble is there is nothing clear-cut. He has had injections and now maybe there is a case for surgery. But I still think we could one day have him running in as he did in South Africa last winter.\" Flintoff was the last England cricketer to be handed the poisoned chalice that identified him as the successor to Ian Botham. He was never going to fill those oversized boots but his potential, like his size, is immense. He is a spectacular striker of a cricket ball and, when fit, can generate real pace from a short run-up. For brute strength he is more than a match for Botham. But the skill will probably never measure up, and the fitness and stamina certainly never will. Flintoff made his Test debut in the 1998 home series against South Africa and scored a half-century on his one-day international debut, against Pakistan in Sharjah the following year. Last winter he played in England's first four Tests in South Africa but was flown home after suffering a stress fracture of the left foot during the Cape Town Test. He appeared in the first three Tests of this summer before more back trouble caused him to miss the remaining Tests, and he played as a specialist batsman in the inaugural NatWest Series. Last summer, however, it was an injury to his pride which he found most painful. The England management, disappointed by his easy-going attitude, revealed that he weighed 17st 12lb - heavier than Lennox Lewis. His England team-mates called him FS, standing for Fat Slogger. And even when he played well he was greeted by such tabloid headlines as \"Praise the Lard\". Since then he has trained well and lost weight. The fat-boy jokes have dried up. This morning there is something more serious to discuss. A considerable talent has reached a career crisis point. \u0095 Pakistan's squad for Tuesday's first one-day international against England includes four spinners - Shahid Afridi, Mushtaq Ahmed, Shoaib Malik and Saqlain Mushtaq - but there is no place for the experienced batsman Ijaz Ahmed. Pakistan squad: Moin Khan (capt), Inzamam-ul-Haq, Saeed Anwar, Salim Elahi, Imran Nazir, Shahid Afridi, Yousuf Youhana, Faisal Iqbal, Wasim Akram, Waqar Younis, Abdur Razzaq, Azhar Mahmood, Saqlain Mushtaq, Mushtaq Ahmad, Shoaib Malik.",

      "body": "<p>The background to Scottish Labour's convulsions after Donald Dewar's death is the fact the Labour party no longer has sole control of executive government in Edinburgh or Cardiff, where a Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition is being formed.</p> <p>Looked at from London, this must look worrying. The personal contacts and friendships that would help ensure that devolution did not bring about dangerous division are no longer reliably in place. But viewed from Edinburgh and Cardiff, the picture looks very different.</p> <p>Labour may have introduced devolution but it has had difficulty profiting from it. The party performed poorly in the first devolution elections. In Scotland its 34% share of the party list vote was lower than in any Westminster election since 1931. In Wales, its 35% share broke records as far back as 1918.</p> <p>This was not some mid-term protest reaction to the performance and policies of the Blair government. In both Scotland and Wales more people thought things had improved since Labour had come to power than thought they had got worse, at least as far as living standards, education and unemployment were concerned. Whatever people thought of the record of the government seemed to make little difference to whether or not they remained loyal to Labour in their new national elections.</p> <p>Labour's difficulties lay elsewhere. People who were still willing to vote Labour for Westminster proved reluctant to back the party when it came to the Scottish or Welsh contests. Many opted for the nationalists instead.</p> <p>In Scotland, Labour's share of the vote was no less than 9% adrift of what it would have secured in a Westminster election. In Wales, the equivalent figure was as much as 13%. Without this devolution gap Labour would have done pretty much as well as it had in 1997. There would be no need of a coalition in Wales and maybe not even in Scotland.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the nationalists rode high. In Scotland they were 7% better off than they would have been in a Westminster byelection. In Wales they were no less than 17% ahead. Without the devolution gap, the \"quiet earthquake\" experienced in last year's Welsh election would not have registered on the Richter scale at all.</p> <p>Nothing that Labour has done in the first year of devo lution has closed the devolution gap. For example, the most recent Scottish poll puts Labour and the Scottish National party (SNP) even stevens when it came to people's intentions on voting for the House of Commons, but no less than 14% behind in the race for the Scottish parliament.</p> <p>So what accounts for the devolution gap? Why did voters who would not consider voting nationalist in a Westminster election do so when it came to the devolved elections?</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, perhaps, many voters in Scotland and Wales are doubtful about how far London looks after them. In both countries no more than one in three believes that the UK government works in their country's best long-term interests \"just about always\" or \"most of the time\". So when invited to elect a parliament for Scotland and an assembly for Wales, many were looking for a party that would use the new institutions to redress the balance.</p> <p>Many doubted Labour fitted the bill. Just 40% of people in Scotland trust Labour to look after their interests. In Wales, the equivalent figure is 44%. In contrast 68% in Scotland trust the SNP to look after Scots' interests and in Wales 82% say the same of Plaid Cymru.</p> <p>And it was these perceptions that brought new votes into the nationalist camp. Our research looked at those who said they would not have voted nationalist in a Westminster election who actually did so in last year's devolved election, broken down by the level of trust they had in the ability of various institutions to advance Scottish/Welsh interests. We found voters who were distrustful of the UK government in general and of New Labour in particular were more likely to switch to the nationalists. In Scotland, it was the former perception that was the more important while in Wales it was the latter - a reflection, perhaps, of the particular opprobrium Labour heaped upon itself by attempting to block Rhodri Morgan's progress towards leadership of the Welsh assembly. Voters were even more likely to switch if at the same time they trusted the SNP or Plaid Cymru (as most of them did).</p> <p>The Scottish and Welsh Labour parties themselves were unable to escape from the long shadow cast by New Labour at Westminster. Voters did take a more charitable view when they were asked whether Scottish or Welsh Labour looked after the interests of people in their country. As the chart shows, substantially more trusted their national Labour parties over Labour at large.</p> <p>But these perceptions were unable to stem the tide to the nationalists, which proved equally strong among those who trusted the Scottish or Welsh Labour parties as among those who did not.</p> <p>The lesson for Labour in both Scotland and Wales is clear. Voters want those running their new institutions to advance their interests. If they are not to conclude that only the nationalists will do so, then Labour needs to show it can do things differently in Scotland and Wales than in London. Preserving the United Kingdom's unions means allowing the devolution child to grow up, not keeping it tied to its umbilical cord.</p> <p>John Curtice is deputy director of the Economic and Social Research Council's Centre for research into elections and social trends.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:J.Curtice@strath.ac.uk\">J.Curtice@strath.ac.uk</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "The background to Scottish Labour's convulsions after Donald Dewar's death is the fact the Labour party no longer has sole control of executive government in Edinburgh or Cardiff, where a Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition is being formed. Looked at from London, this must look worrying. The personal contacts and friendships that would help ensure that devolution did not bring about dangerous division are no longer reliably in place. But viewed from Edinburgh and Cardiff, the picture looks very different. Labour may have introduced devolution but it has had difficulty profiting from it. The party performed poorly in the first devolution elections. In Scotland its 34% share of the party list vote was lower than in any Westminster election since 1931. In Wales, its 35% share broke records as far back as 1918. This was not some mid-term protest reaction to the performance and policies of the Blair government. In both Scotland and Wales more people thought things had improved since Labour had come to power than thought they had got worse, at least as far as living standards, education and unemployment were concerned. Whatever people thought of the record of the government seemed to make little difference to whether or not they remained loyal to Labour in their new national elections. Labour's difficulties lay elsewhere. People who were still willing to vote Labour for Westminster proved reluctant to back the party when it came to the Scottish or Welsh contests. Many opted for the nationalists instead. In Scotland, Labour's share of the vote was no less than 9% adrift of what it would have secured in a Westminster election. In Wales, the equivalent figure was as much as 13%. Without this devolution gap Labour would have done pretty much as well as it had in 1997. There would be no need of a coalition in Wales and maybe not even in Scotland. Meanwhile, the nationalists rode high. In Scotland they were 7% better off than they would have been in a Westminster byelection. In Wales they were no less than 17% ahead. Without the devolution gap, the \"quiet earthquake\" experienced in last year's Welsh election would not have registered on the Richter scale at all. Nothing that Labour has done in the first year of devo lution has closed the devolution gap. For example, the most recent Scottish poll puts Labour and the Scottish National party (SNP) even stevens when it came to people's intentions on voting for the House of Commons, but no less than 14% behind in the race for the Scottish parliament. So what accounts for the devolution gap? Why did voters who would not consider voting nationalist in a Westminster election do so when it came to the devolved elections? Unsurprisingly, perhaps, many voters in Scotland and Wales are doubtful about how far London looks after them. In both countries no more than one in three believes that the UK government works in their country's best long-term interests \"just about always\" or \"most of the time\". So when invited to elect a parliament for Scotland and an assembly for Wales, many were looking for a party that would use the new institutions to redress the balance. Many doubted Labour fitted the bill. Just 40% of people in Scotland trust Labour to look after their interests. In Wales, the equivalent figure is 44%. In contrast 68% in Scotland trust the SNP to look after Scots' interests and in Wales 82% say the same of Plaid Cymru. And it was these perceptions that brought new votes into the nationalist camp. Our research looked at those who said they would not have voted nationalist in a Westminster election who actually did so in last year's devolved election, broken down by the level of trust they had in the ability of various institutions to advance Scottish/Welsh interests. We found voters who were distrustful of the UK government in general and of New Labour in particular were more likely to switch to the nationalists. In Scotland, it was the former perception that was the more important while in Wales it was the latter - a reflection, perhaps, of the particular opprobrium Labour heaped upon itself by attempting to block Rhodri Morgan's progress towards leadership of the Welsh assembly. Voters were even more likely to switch if at the same time they trusted the SNP or Plaid Cymru (as most of them did). The Scottish and Welsh Labour parties themselves were unable to escape from the long shadow cast by New Labour at Westminster. Voters did take a more charitable view when they were asked whether Scottish or Welsh Labour looked after the interests of people in their country. As the chart shows, substantially more trusted their national Labour parties over Labour at large. But these perceptions were unable to stem the tide to the nationalists, which proved equally strong among those who trusted the Scottish or Welsh Labour parties as among those who did not. The lesson for Labour in both Scotland and Wales is clear. Voters want those running their new institutions to advance their interests. If they are not to conclude that only the nationalists will do so, then Labour needs to show it can do things differently in Scotland and Wales than in London. Preserving the United Kingdom's unions means allowing the devolution child to grow up, not keeping it tied to its umbilical cord.

      "body": "<p>Panic over, at least for now. Yesterday the \"new economy\" roared back with a vengeance finding confidence from the strong earnings figures posted by the likes of Microsoft, AOL and Nokia and subsequent recovery of the Nasdaq index. </p> <p>So up went Wednesday's fallers - the telecoms, media, and technology stocks - and down went Wednesday's risers - the food retailers and utility companies. It made little sense but dealers were not complaining because every trade was generating a commission. </p> <p>Recovering its poise after Wednesday's stomach churning volatility, the FTSE 100 index ended 70.7 points ahead at 6,218.9 as the 13th anniversary of the 1987 stock market crash passed without incident. In New York things were just as bright with the Dow Jones industrial average back above the 10,000-point level as Lon don closed and the Nasdaq was up almost 7%. </p> <p>Back in London the Techmark index responded by closing up 112.1 points at 3,327.73, while the FTSE 250 index added 62.4 points to 6,434.7. </p> <p>Among the leaders, <strong> Logica </strong> , down 220p on Wednesday, advanced 175p to \u00a318.05, <strong> Misys</strong> added 59.5p to 724p, <strong> Sema</strong> gained 70p to 970p, all for the reason that the Nasdaq was expected to, and did open higher. </p> <p>Internet security group<strong> Baltimore Technologies </strong> , another of Wednesday's victims, advanced 31p to 475p in relief that the placing of 38m shares had been completed. The shares were offloaded to City fund managers at the knockdown price of 440p. News that its all-paper acquisition of email security group, Content Technologies, was still going ahead also helped sentiment. </p> <p>Elsewhere, electronic news specialist <strong> Reuters</strong> added 118p to \u00a312.38 ahead of its third-quarter trading report later today. There are hopes the group will announce the partial flotation of its internet brokerage Instinet. </p> <p>Telecoms group<strong> Energis </strong> gained 45p to 485p after brokers at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson urged clients to pile into the stock. Other telecoms groups in demand included <strong> Vodafone </strong> , up 15.75p to 269p and <strong> Cable &amp; Wireless </strong> , 17p better at 840p. </p> <p>Internet group <strong> Freeserve</strong> added 6p to 166p but it was not enough to save if from relegation to the FTSE 250. </p> <p>After the close, index complier FTSE International revealed the results of the reshuffle that has been forced by the demergers of <strong> BG </strong> , down 8p to 425p, and <strong> P&amp;O Group </strong> , off 1p to 568p. </p> <p>With the FTSE 100 becoming the FTSE 102 following the demergers it said the two smallest companies in the blue-chip index based on last night's closing price would have to go. They were Freeserve and P&amp;O, one half of the demerged P&amp;O Group. </p> <p>Making way for them in the FTSE 250 will be computer games maker <strong> Eidos </strong> , up 18p to 267.25p and software firm <strong> Cedar Group </strong> , 30p higher at 425p. The changes are effective from today's close. </p> <p>On the downside, high street chemist <strong> Boots</strong> handed back a portion of Wednesday's gain - the stock ending 27p lower at 532p. <strong> Tesco </strong> slipped 9.5p to 258.5p after investors decided that the recent advance in the stock - which was changing hands for around 215p in early September - could not be justified on fundamentals. </p> <p>Lower down the corporate ladder the pattern was much the same. <strong> Atlantic Telecom </strong> , a stock that dealers practically could not give away earlier this week, surged 32.5p to 206p on the back of winning a contract with Vodafone. </p> <p>Data compression specialist <strong> Geo Interactive</strong> rose 110p to \u00a310.40 after signing a deal with US company Commontouch said to be worth $1.2m (\u00a3830,000). German broker WestLB Panmure was impressed by the deal and a 12-18 month target price of \u00a323. </p> <p> <strong> Hazlewood Foods</strong> added 2.5p to 112.5p, on talk a 125p- a-share bid is on the way and <strong> Kingston Communications</strong> added to 20p to 310p on whispers UBS Warburg is preparing a bullish \"buy\" note.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Panic over, at least for now. Yesterday the \"new economy\" roared back with a vengeance finding confidence from the strong earnings figures posted by the likes of Microsoft, AOL and Nokia and subsequent recovery of the Nasdaq index. So up went Wednesday's fallers - the telecoms, media, and technology stocks - and down went Wednesday's risers - the food retailers and utility companies. It made little sense but dealers were not complaining because every trade was generating a commission. Recovering its poise after Wednesday's stomach churning volatility, the FTSE 100 index ended 70.7 points ahead at 6,218.9 as the 13th anniversary of the 1987 stock market crash passed without incident. In New York things were just as bright with the Dow Jones industrial average back above the 10,000-point level as Lon don closed and the Nasdaq was up almost 7%. Back in London the Techmark index responded by closing up 112.1 points at 3,327.73, while the FTSE 250 index added 62.4 points to 6,434.7. Among the leaders, Logica , down 220p on Wednesday, advanced 175p to \u00a318.05, Misys added 59.5p to 724p, Sema gained 70p to 970p, all for the reason that the Nasdaq was expected to, and did open higher. Internet security group Baltimore Technologies , another of Wednesday's victims, advanced 31p to 475p in relief that the placing of 38m shares had been completed. The shares were offloaded to City fund managers at the knockdown price of 440p. News that its all-paper acquisition of email security group, Content Technologies, was still going ahead also helped sentiment. Elsewhere, electronic news specialist Reuters added 118p to \u00a312.38 ahead of its third-quarter trading report later today. There are hopes the group will announce the partial flotation of its internet brokerage Instinet. Telecoms group Energis gained 45p to 485p after brokers at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson urged clients to pile into the stock. Other telecoms groups in demand included Vodafone , up 15.75p to 269p and Cable &amp; Wireless , 17p better at 840p. Internet group Freeserve added 6p to 166p but it was not enough to save if from relegation to the FTSE 250. After the close, index complier FTSE International revealed the results of the reshuffle that has been forced by the demergers of BG , down 8p to 425p, and P&amp;O Group , off 1p to 568p. With the FTSE 100 becoming the FTSE 102 following the demergers it said the two smallest companies in the blue-chip index based on last night's closing price would have to go. They were Freeserve and P&amp;O, one half of the demerged P&amp;O Group. Making way for them in the FTSE 250 will be computer games maker Eidos , up 18p to 267.25p and software firm Cedar Group , 30p higher at 425p. The changes are effective from today's close. On the downside, high street chemist Boots handed back a portion of Wednesday's gain - the stock ending 27p lower at 532p. Tesco slipped 9.5p to 258.5p after investors decided that the recent advance in the stock - which was changing hands for around 215p in early September - could not be justified on fundamentals. Lower down the corporate ladder the pattern was much the same. Atlantic Telecom , a stock that dealers practically could not give away earlier this week, surged 32.5p to 206p on the back of winning a contract with Vodafone. Data compression specialist Geo Interactive rose 110p to \u00a310.40 after signing a deal with US company Commontouch said to be worth $1.2m (\u00a3830,000). German broker WestLB Panmure was impressed by the deal and a 12-18 month target price of \u00a323. Hazlewood Foods added 2.5p to 112.5p, on talk a 125p- a-share bid is on the way and Kingston Communications added to 20p to 310p on whispers UBS Warburg is preparing a bullish \"buy\" note.",

      "body": "<p>At around four o'clock I finally strolled into the living room, where Jim had spent the last couple of years researching his Ph.D. Today this involved playing Tomb Raider with Simon. They both managed to mumble hello to me, though since neither of them managed to look up from the screen I could just as easily have been the creature from the black lagoon wandering in to put the kettle on. Jim and Simon looked like the \"Before\" and \"After\" drawings in the Charles Atlas body-building adverts. Jim was tall and muscular with the healthy complexion of a boy who'd been skiing every winter since he was five years old, and by contrast, Simon was skinny, pallid and awkward. If they made Tomb Raider any more realistic, Lara Croft would turn round and say out of the TV screen, \"Stop staring at my tits like that, you little creep,\" and blast him off the sofa. He had a promising career serving pints of lager in plastic glasses to students of the university from which he had graduated some years ago. He had got the job on the day he'd left and was hoping to earn enough money to one day pay off the debts he had accumulated on the other side of the bar.</p> <p>At that moment the front door slammed and Paul returned home, dumping a pile of tatty exercise books on the kitchen table with a martyred sigh that was far too obviously intended to elicit concerned enquiries about his day and consequently received none.</p> <p>\"Dear oh dear,\" said Paul, but we all still refused to bite. He put a carton of milk back in the fridge and took a couple of old tea bags out of the sink, tutting quietly to himself. His sighs not only announced his irritation that everyone else didn't tidy up as they went along, but also his annoyance that it should be left to him to clear up when he had already done a full day's teaching. It was as if he was implying that Simon's evening job or Jim's Ph.D or my composing at my keyboard were somehow less-demanding work. The fact that this was true was entirely beside the point.</p> <p>The four of us had shared this place for a couple of years now. None of them had known me when I had first taken the room, and in some ways that was how I preferred to keep things. The flat boasted views across the splendour that is Balham High Road, and was conveniently located above a shop, where we could pop down and buy halal meat at any time of the day or night. But it was not the tatty run-down flat that you would expect four men sharing to wallow in; there was a strict cleaning rota, in which we took turns to leave all the clearing up for Paul.</p> <p>Paul put what was left of a slab of butter into the butter dish and then folded the foil neatly before throwing it in the bin. Since talking to the entire room failed to get him any attention, he attempted to address someone directly.</p> <p>\"Michael, how was your day?\"</p> <p>\"It's been a fucking disaster,\" I said.</p> <p>\"Oh no, what happened?\" he replied, sounding genuinely concerned.</p> <p>\"Bloody paper boy woke me up at seven o'clock to tell me he's not going to deliver the paper to the end of my bed any more. He said his mother thinks it's weird. I distinctly remember saying to him when we first agreed on the arrangement that it would probably be wise not to mention it to his parents.\"</p> <p>There was a pause.</p> <p>\"No. I told his mother,\" confessed Paul with the defiant air of a man who had been preparing himself for this confrontation.</p> <p>\"You! What on earth did you do that for?\"</p> <p>\"Well, for a start I am not particularly wild about you handing out the front door keys of our flat to a thirteen-year-old delinquent.\"</p> <p>\"He's not a delinquent.\"</p> <p>\"Yes, he is a delinquent, and do you know how I know that? Because I teach him. Troy is in my class. And the day before yesterday, at seven a.m., I walked out of the bathroom stark bollock naked to see Troy standing there on the landing staring at me.\"</p> <p>At that moment Jim laughed so much he had to spit his tea back into the mug. \"What did you say?\"</p> <p>\"Well, I said, _Hello, Troy.\"</p> <p>\"What did he say?\"</p> <p>\"He said, 'Hello, Mr Hitchcock.' He looked a little confused, to tell the truth. In fact, it was pretty bad luck on his part as well; he'd been trying to avoid me for a few days because he owed me an essay on the character of Piggy in Lord of the Flies. I think for a moment he thought I'd broken into this house at seven in the morning with no clothes on just to ask him for his essay.\"</p> <p>I was still irritated. \"So you bumped into him on the landing. So what? Doesn't mean you have to tell his mother.\"</p> <p>\"I am his teacher. It doesn't look too good, does it? boy visits naked teacher's flat before lessons. Besides, I do not appreciate having to tell my class that the correct pronunciation of my name is Mr Hitchcock, not Mr Titchy-cock.\"</p> <p>Jim's tea had now been spat out so many times it was undrinkable.</p> <p>\"And so, at last night's parents' evening,\" Paul continued, \"I told his mother that her son had a key to my flat and that the previous morning he had seen me naked.\"</p> <p>\"That probably wasn't the best way to put it.\"</p> <p>\"Well, with the benefit of hindsight I realize I might have phrased it differently. She went mad and started hitting me with her shoe. Had to be pulled off by the deputy head.\"</p> <p>Paul looked hurt to be the unwitting subject of such general amusement.</p> <p>\"Don't take it personally, Paul,\" I said, \"we're not laughing at you.\" \"I am,\" said Jim.</p> <p>\"Yeah, I am as well actually,\" added Simon.</p> <p>Paul settled down to do his marking, and his pupils got far lower marks than they would have done if we had been nicer to him. He was clearly one of those teachers who are unable to keep control in the classroom. There was just something about him that marked him out as the injured wildebeest limping on the edge of the herd. He always tried to play this down, even when one of the pupils sold his car.</p> <p>I don't know why they felt they needed to go to such lengths to wind him up when he seemed to get infuriated by the littlest things. He once told us that from now on he would only be removing his own hairs from the gunge that was blocking the plughole, since no-one else ever seemed to do it, and so we found him crouched in an empty bath trying to separate the red hairs from all the others. It wasn't that Paul was petty, it was just that he got annoyed when anyone squeezed the toothpaste from the wrong end of the tube. In fact, all sorts of things about us aggravated him.</p> <p>We sat around the kitchen table for a bit longer and then Jim announced that he was going to make a brew. Paul always declined Jim's offer of tea because the way Jim made tea was the essence of what Paul found so irritating about him.</p> <p>Jim's tea-making routine was a triumph of day-dreaming inefficiency. First he would take the mugs from the cupboard and arrange them on a tray. Then he would stop near the sink and look a little lost for a while as he tried to remember what it was that he had been meaning to do. Then it would come back to him: get the milk out of the fridge. After the milk had been poured into each cup he would get the tea bags and put them into the teapot. And then, when he had done all that, when he had got everything ready and realized he'd got out one mug too many and so put it back in the cupboard, and then put the sugar bowl on the tray and decided that there was nothing else he had to do, then he would put the kettle on.</p> <p>For Paul, this sequence alone made Jim virtually impossible to live with. And he didn't just put the kettle on last, he also filled it right to the top so it took far longer than necessary for three cups of tea. And while it was taking an eternity to boil he would just stand there waiting, occasionally moving the mugs about on the tray. And all the while he would be completely unaware that Paul was about to explode with frustration at the impracticality of this order of doing things. Try as he might, Paul could not let Jim do things his way. I knew that within sixty seconds he would ask Jim why he didn't put the kettle on first.</p> <p>\"Jim, why don't you put the kettle on first?\" he asked three seconds later.</p> <p>\"Hmmm?\"</p> <p>\"I was just saying, it would be a bit quicker if you put the kettle on first. You know, before you put out the mugs and everything.\"</p> <p>Jim gave an indifferent shrug. \"Well, it wouldn't boil any quicker, would it.\"</p> <p>He was as slow to see Paul's logic as he was at making tea.</p> <p>\"No, but it would boil sooner, because you would've put it on earlier, and then you could do the tea bags and milk and everything while it was boiling.\" He had to stop himself screaming the last four words in Jim's face. Jim was bemused by his flatmate's concern.</p> <p> \"They're not in a hurry to go out or anything, are they? You're not in a hurry to go out, are you, Simon?\"</p> <p>Simon looked up from the paper. \"Me? No.\"</p> <p>\"No-one's in a hurry, so what does it matter?\"</p> <p>I could see Paul's frustration rising; his face went bright red, which at least had the consolation of making his little ginger beard less prominent. \"It's just a really inefficient way to make a cup of tea.\"</p> <p>\"But you're not even having a cup.\"</p> <p>\"No, I'm not, because it's so annoying that you always do it wrong.\" And with that he stomped out of the room. Jim looked completely perplexed.</p> <p>\"Have I been putting sugar in Paul_s tea when he doesn_t take it or something?\"</p> <p>Simon mumbled that he didn't think so and Jim shrugged and stood by the sink for a while and after five minutes realized that he hadn't pressed the \"on\" button on the side of the kettle.</p> <p>When the tea was made, the remaining three of us drank it in contemplative silence. Simon was reading the \"Dear Deirdre\" column in the Sun, in which Deirdre tackled the sexual problems of members of the general public, which I was convinced had been made up by journalists in the next door office.</p> <p>\"My brother-in-law is my lover,\" he read out. \"Dear Deirdre, I am an attractive blonde and people say I have a good figure. The other night, when my husband was away, his brother came round and one thing led to another and we ended up in bed . . . \" He broke off from reading out the letter. \"They always say that: one thing led to another. How exactly does one thing lead to another, because that must be the bit that I'm getting wrong. I understand the brother coming round, and I understand that they were in bed together. But how did they get from the first stage to the last?\"</p> <p>\"It's easy, Simon,\" said Jim.</p> <p>\"Well, what? How do you do it?\"</p> <p>\"You meet a girl.\"</p> <p>\"Yes.\"</p> <p>\"She comes back for coffee.\"</p> <p>\"Yes, but then what?\"</p> <p>\"Well, one thing leads to another.\"</p> <p>After my second cup of tea I felt I'd finally run out of valid excuses for keeping the advertising agency waiting any longer, and so I collected the tape from my room and headed towards Balham tube station. Thirty minutes later I was walking down Berwick Street, where a couple of French students with a disposable camera nearly got run over trying to recreate the cover of What's the Story Morning Glory? I loved coming to Soho; it felt exciting and happening, and for a brief moment I liked to pretend I was part of it all. There were people here who earned a thousand pounds a day just for doing one voiceover for an advert, and then they'd blow it all by buying a prawn and avocado on focaccia with a caf\u00e9 latte to go. </p> <p>I glanced across the road and caught sight of Hugo from DD&amp;G, staring at a shop window. That's peculiar, I thought. Why is Hugo staring into the window of a wholesale Asian jewellery shop? Then he glanced up and down the road quickly and disappeared into a tatty open doorway under the glow of a dangerously wired red light. I was shocked. I approached the open doorway and looked in. The words \"New model. Very friendly. First floor\" were scrawled onto a piece of card that was stuck by the entrance with thick brown masking tape. I looked up the rickety uncarpeted stairs and wondered what lay beyond. Maybe Hugo was just going in to offer to improve their advertising, to suggest a professional copywriter who could produce a snappier slogan and spell \"friendly\" correctly. It seemed unlikely. I was part repulsed, part fascinated and strangely disappointed in Hugo, as if he had let me down personally.</p> <p>I continued up Berwick Street and finally entered the reception of the grand offices of DD&amp;G, where a certificate boasted that they were runners up for Best Investment and Banking Commercial at last year's Radio Advertising Awards. Apparently, Hugo had just popped out to get his wife a birthday card, so the tape was left with the beautiful waif of a receptionist, who sat in the window framed by lavish arrangements of fresh flowers.</p> <p>My work for the week was done. It was time to head for North London. In the rush hour I squeezed my way onto the tube with all the people who had spent the day at work. Hundreds of sweaty office workers pressing their bodies together and yet managing to give the impression that they were not the slightest bit aware that there was anyone else in the carriage. Arms bending into impossible angles to read paperbacks bent over at the spine. Necks craning to read someone else's newspaper. Christians re-reading the bible as if they didn't know it all by now. Suddenly a seat became available and I moved towards it as quickly as is possible without revealing that I was doing anything as undignified as hurrying. As I sat down I breathed out a satisfied sigh, but any relaxation soon flipped over into anxiety. A woman was standing right in front of me, and from under her dress protruded The Bulge Of Uncertainty. Was she six months pregnant or was she just a bit, well . . . fat? It was just impossible to say. I looked her up and down. Why can't she give me a sign? I thought. Why couldn't she be carrying a Mothercare bag or wearing one of those naff sweatshirts that say, \"Yes I am!\" I looked again. The dress hung loosely everywhere else; it was just on her rounded stomach that the material was stretched and taut. Which was worse, I wondered, denying a seat to a pregnant woman or offering a seat to a woman who wasn't pregnant but just looked as if she was. Maybe this is why men used to give up their seats to all women, to escape this embarrassing dilemma. No-one else seemed concerned, but I felt I had to do the decent thing.</p> <p>\"Sorry. Would you like to sit down?\" I said, getting up.</p> <p>\"Why would I want to sit down?\" she said aggressively.</p> <p>Shit, I thought. \"Erm . . . Well, you just looked a bit tired . . . um, and I'm getting off at the next stop anyway,\" I lied.</p> <p>On this understanding she took my seat, and I was forced to leave the carriage to maintain the deceit. I fought my way through the throng on the platform and rushed to get back on the train a couple of carriages further up. The not-pregnant woman had given me a very odd look, but it wasn't as strange as the one she gave me when we both went through the barriers at Kentish Town station fifteen minutes later.</p> <p>As I emerged back into the open air, my mobile phone signalled that I had a message. It was Hugo. He said he was sorry he'd missed me but that he had been in and out all afternoon, which was more detail than I needed. He was pleased with my piece of music and told me that I'd come up with something \"pretty bloody special\". Although I generally found Hugo very insincere and of poor judgement I was prepared to make an exception in this case. I never felt confident that the snippets of music I wrote were any good. Whenever a decent tune came into my head I couldn't believe that I hadn't just subconsciously stolen it from somewhere, so any form of praise was eagerly gobbled up. Sadly, the track was only for a pitch and the agency would probably never use Hugo's production company, so no-one would ever hear it. I had known this when I'd taken the job, but I knew I could do it quickly, it paid the bills and it meant I could afford to spend a couple of stress-free days in the cocoon I had created for myself.</p> <p>I turned into Bartholomew Close. Tall, monolithic grey wheelie bins lined the street, like Easter Island statues waiting impassively for strangers. I walked up to number 17 and put the key in the lock. As I opened the front door I was hit by the chaos and noise.</p> <p>\"Daddy!\" exclaimed my two-year-old daughter Millie with delight as she ran up the hallway and hugged my leg. There was a tape of children's nursery rhymes playing on the stereo and Alfie, my baby boy, was jiggling his limbs delightedly in his mother's arms.</p> <p>\"You're earlier than I expected,\" said Catherine with a smile. I tiptoed over some wooden bricks that were scattered on the carpet, gave her a kiss and then took Alfie from her.</p> <p>\"Yeah, and guess what? I've finished the job and won't have to work at all this weekend.\"</p> <p>\"Fantastic,\" she said. \"Then it's a double celebration. Because guess who wee'd in her potty today?\"</p> <p>\"Did you, Millie?\"</p> <p>Millie nodded with extraordinary pride, which was only surpassed by that of her mother.</p> <p>\"And you didn't get any on the floor, did you, Millie? Which is better than your daddy usually manages and he's thirty-two.\"</p> <p>I gave Catherine an affectionate poke in the ribs. \"Look, it's not my fault the toilet seat always falls down.\"</p> <p>\"No, it's that idiot who fitted it,\" she concurred, referring to the evening when it had taken me three hours to fit a new wooden toilet seat incorrectly.</p> <p>Millie had obviously enjoyed the praise that had been heaped upon her, so she quickly found another way to get some more attention. \"I done cat drawing,\" she said, presenting me with a scrap of paper, which I took from her and studied carefully. Frankly, Millie's drawing was rubbish. To represent our cat, she had taken the blue crayon and scribbled it up and down on a piece of paper.</p> <p>\"Ooh, Millie, that's a super picture. You are a clever girl.\" One day she would turn round and say, \"Don't patronize me, Father, we both know the picture is crap,\" but for the time being she seemed to buy it. I loved coming home when I hadn't seen them all for a couple of days; they were always so delighted to see me. It was the return of the prodigal father.</p> <p>Catherine grabbed the chance to start clearing up the kitchen as I played with the kids for a while. I played hide and seek with Millie, which was made easier by the fact that she hid in the same spot behind the curtains three times in a row. Then I made Alfie giggle by throwing him up in the air until Catherine came back into the room to see why he'd suddenly started crying.</p> <p>\"I don't know,\" I said, trying not to look up at the metal chandelier swinging back and forth above her head. She took the crying baby back, and at that moment I thought she looked a little tired, so I said I'd take over tidying up. I slipped upstairs, gathering scattered toys as I went. I ran a big foamy bath, turned off the light and lit a couple of candles. Then I placed the portable CD player in the bathroom and put on Beethoven's Pastoral Symphony.</p> <p>\"Catherine, can you just come upstairs a minute,\" I shouted. She came up and surveyed the instant sanctuary that I had created.</p> <p>\"I'll take over the kids and load the dishwasher and everything. You get in there and I'll bring you a glass of wine, and you're not allowed out till the end of the final movement, 'Shepherds Song; Beneficent Feelings After the Storm'.\"</p> <p>She leaned against me. \"Oh, Michael. What have I done to deserve this?\"</p> <p>\"Well, you've been looking after the kids on your own for a couple of days and you must need a bit of space.\"</p> <p>\"Yes, but you've been working hard, too. Don't you need a rest?\"</p> <p>\"I don't work as hard as you,\" I said sincerely. After a few half-hearted guilty protestations she clicked on the heated towel rail and turned up the volume loud enough to drown out the indignant shouts of \"Mummy!\" that had already started to emanate from the kitchen. \"Michael,\" she said as she kissed me on the cheek, \"thanks for being the best husband in the world.\" I smiled a half-smile. When your wife says something like that, it doesn't seem like the right moment to put her straight.</p>",

In fact, it was pretty bad luck on his part as well; he'd been trying to avoid me for a few days because he owed me an essay on the character of Piggy in Lord of the Flies. I think for a moment he thought I'd broken into this house at seven in the morning with no clothes on just to ask him for his essay.\" I was still irritated. \"So you bumped into him on the landing. So what? Doesn't mean you have to tell his mother.\" \"I am his teacher. It doesn't look too good, does it? boy visits naked teacher's flat before lessons. Besides, I do not appreciate having to tell my class that the correct pronunciation of my name is Mr Hitchcock, not Mr Titchy-cock.\" Jim's tea had now been spat out so many times it was undrinkable. \"And so, at last night's parents' evening,\" Paul continued, \"I told his mother that her son had a key to my flat and that the previous morning he had seen me naked.\" \"That probably wasn't the best way to put it.\" \"Well, with the benefit of hindsight I realize I might have phrased it differently. She went mad and started hitting me with her shoe. Had to be pulled off by the deputy head.\" Paul looked hurt to be the unwitting subject of such general amusement. \"Don't take it personally, Paul,\" I said, \"we're not laughing at you.\" \"I am,\" said Jim. \"Yeah, I am as well actually,\" added Simon. Paul settled down to do his marking, and his pupils got far lower marks than they would have done if we had been nicer to him. He was clearly one of those teachers who are unable to keep control in the classroom. There was just something about him that marked him out as the injured wildebeest limping on the edge of the herd. He always tried to play this down, even when one of the pupils sold his car. I don't know why they felt they needed to go to such lengths to wind him up when he seemed to get infuriated by the littlest things. He once told us that from now on he would only be removing his own hairs from the gunge that was blocking the plughole, since no-one else ever seemed to do it, and so we found him crouched in an empty bath trying to separate the red hairs from all the others. It wasn't that Paul was petty, it was just that he got annoyed when anyone squeezed the toothpaste from the wrong end of the tube. In fact, all sorts of things about us aggravated him. We sat around the kitchen table for a bit longer and then Jim announced that he was going to make a brew. Paul always declined Jim's offer of tea because the way Jim made tea was the essence of what Paul found so irritating about him. Jim's tea-making routine was a triumph of day-dreaming inefficiency. First he would take the mugs from the cupboard and arrange them on a tray. Then he would stop near the sink and look a little lost for a while as he tried to remember what it was that he had been meaning to do. Then it would come back to him: get the milk out of the fridge. After the milk had been poured into each cup he would get the tea bags and put them into the teapot. And then, when he had done all that, when he had got everything ready and realized he'd got out one mug too many and so put it back in the cupboard, and then put the sugar bowl on the tray and decided that there was nothing else he had to do, then he would put the kettle on. For Paul, this sequence alone made Jim virtually impossible to live with. And he didn't just put the kettle on last, he also filled it right to the top so it took far longer than necessary for three cups of tea. And while it was taking an eternity to boil he would just stand there waiting, occasionally moving the mugs about on the tray. And all the while he would be completely unaware that Paul was about to explode with frustration at the impracticality of this order of doing things. Try as he might, Paul could not let Jim do things his way. I knew that within sixty seconds he would ask Jim why he didn't put the kettle on first. \"Jim, why don't you put the kettle on first?\" he asked three seconds later. \"Hmmm?\" \"I was just saying, it would be a bit quicker if you put the kettle on first. You know, before you put out the mugs and everything.\" Jim gave an indifferent shrug. \"Well, it wouldn't boil any quicker, would it.\" He was as slow to see Paul's logic as he was at making tea. \"No, but it would boil sooner, because you would've put it on earlier, and then you could do the tea bags and milk and everything while it was boiling.\" He had to stop himself screaming the last four words in Jim's face. Jim was bemused by his flatmate's concern. \"They're not in a hurry to go out or anything, are they? You're not in a hurry to go out, are you, Simon?\" Simon looked up from the paper. \"Me? No.\" \"No-one's in a hurry, so what does it matter?\" I could see Paul's frustration rising; his face went bright red, which at least had the consolation of making his little ginger beard less prominent. \"It's just a really inefficient way to make a cup of tea.\" \"But you're not even having a cup.\" \"No, I'm not, because it's so annoying that you always do it wrong.\" And with that he stomped out of the room. Jim looked completely perplexed. \"Have I been putting sugar in Paul_s tea when he doesn_t take it or something?\" Simon mumbled that he didn't think so and Jim shrugged and stood by the sink for a while and after five minutes realized that he hadn't pressed the \"on\" button on the side of the kettle. When the tea was made, the remaining three of us drank it in contemplative silence. Simon was reading the \"Dear Deirdre\" column in the Sun, in which Deirdre tackled the sexual problems of members of the general public, which I was convinced had been made up by journalists in the next door office. \"My brother-in-law is my lover,\" he read out. \"Dear Deirdre, I am an attractive blonde and people say I have a good figure. The other night, when my husband was away, his brother came round and one thing led to another and we ended up in bed . . . \" He broke off from reading out the letter. \"They always say that: one thing led to another. How exactly does one thing lead to another, because that must be the bit that I'm getting wrong. I understand the brother coming round, and I understand that they were in bed together. But how did they get from the first stage to the last?\" \"It's easy, Simon,\" said Jim. \"Well, what? How do you do it?\" \"You meet a girl.\" \"Yes.\" \"She comes back for coffee.\" \"Yes, but then what?\" \"Well, one thing leads to another.\" After my second cup of tea I felt I'd finally run out of valid excuses for keeping the advertising agency waiting any longer, and so I collected the tape from my room and headed towards Balham tube station. Thirty minutes later I was walking down Berwick Street, where a couple of French students with a disposable camera nearly got run over trying to recreate the cover of What's the Story Morning Glory? I loved coming to Soho; it felt exciting and happening, and for a brief moment I liked to pretend I was part of it all. There were people here who earned a thousand pounds a day just for doing one voiceover for an advert, and then they'd blow it all by buying a prawn and avocado on focaccia with a caf\u00e9 latte to go. I glanced across the road and caught sight of Hugo from DD&amp;G, staring at a shop window. That's peculiar, I thought. Why is Hugo staring into the window of a wholesale Asian jewellery shop? Then he glanced up and down the road quickly and disappeared into a tatty open doorway under the glow of a dangerously wired red light. I was shocked. I approached the open doorway and looked in. The words \"New model. Very friendly. First floor\" were scrawled onto a piece of card that was stuck by the entrance with thick brown masking tape. I looked up the rickety uncarpeted stairs and wondered what lay beyond. Maybe Hugo was just going in to offer to improve their advertising, to suggest a professional copywriter who could produce a snappier slogan and spell \"friendly\" correctly. It seemed unlikely. I was part repulsed, part fascinated and strangely disappointed in Hugo, as if he had let me down personally. I continued up Berwick Street and finally entered the reception of the grand offices of DD&amp;G, where a certificate boasted that they were runners up for Best Investment and Banking Commercial at last year's Radio Advertising Awards. Apparently, Hugo had just popped out to get his wife a birthday card, so the tape was left with the beautiful waif of a receptionist, who sat in the window framed by lavish arrangements of fresh flowers. My work for the week was done. It was time to head for North London. In the rush hour I squeezed my way onto the tube with all the people who had spent the day at work. Hundreds of sweaty office workers pressing their bodies together and yet managing to give the impression that they were not the slightest bit aware that there was anyone else in the carriage. Arms bending into impossible angles to read paperbacks bent over at the spine. Necks craning to read someone else's newspaper. Christians re-reading the bible as if they didn't know it all by now. Suddenly a seat became available and I moved towards it as quickly as is possible without revealing that I was doing anything as undignified as hurrying. As I sat down I breathed out a satisfied sigh, but any relaxation soon flipped over into anxiety. A woman was standing right in front of me, and from under her dress protruded The Bulge Of Uncertainty. Was she six months pregnant or was she just a bit, well . . . fat? It was just impossible to say. I looked her up and down. Why can't she give me a sign? I thought. Why couldn't she be carrying a Mothercare bag or wearing one of those naff sweatshirts that say, \"Yes I am!\" I looked again. The dress hung loosely everywhere else; it was just on her rounded stomach that the material was stretched and taut. Which was worse, I wondered, denying a seat to a pregnant woman or offering a seat to a woman who wasn't pregnant but just looked as if she was. Maybe this is why men used to give up their seats to all women, to escape this embarrassing dilemma. No-one else seemed concerned, but I felt I had to do the decent thing. \"Sorry. Would you like to sit down?\" I said, getting up. \"Why would I want to sit down?\" she said aggressively. Shit, I thought. \"Erm . . . Well, you just looked a bit tired . . . um, and I'm getting off at the next stop anyway,\" I lied. On this understanding she took my seat, and I was forced to leave the carriage to maintain the deceit. I fought my way through the throng on the platform and rushed to get back on the train a couple of carriages further up. The not-pregnant woman had given me a very odd look, but it wasn't as strange as the one she gave me when we both went through the barriers at Kentish Town station fifteen minutes later. As I emerged back into the open air, my mobile phone signalled that I had a message. It was Hugo. He said he was sorry he'd missed me but that he had been in and out all afternoon, which was more detail than I needed. He was pleased with my piece of music and told me that I'd come up with something \"pretty bloody special\". Although I generally found Hugo very insincere and of poor judgement I was prepared to make an exception in this case. I never felt confident that the snippets of music I wrote were any good. Whenever a decent tune came into my head I couldn't believe that I hadn't just subconsciously stolen it from somewhere, so any form of praise was eagerly gobbled up. Sadly, the track was only for a pitch and the agency would probably never use Hugo's production company, so no-one would ever hear it. I had known this when I'd taken the job, but I knew I could do it quickly, it paid the bills and it meant I could afford to spend a couple of stress-free days in the cocoon I had created for myself. I turned into Bartholomew Close. Tall, monolithic grey wheelie bins lined the street, like Easter Island statues waiting impassively for strangers. I walked up to number 17 and put the key in the lock. As I opened the front door I was hit by the chaos and noise. \"Daddy!\" exclaimed my two-year-old daughter Millie with delight as she ran up the hallway and hugged my leg. There was a tape of children's nursery rhymes playing on the stereo and Alfie, my baby boy, was jiggling his limbs delightedly in his mother's arms. \"You're earlier than I expected,\" said Catherine with a smile. I tiptoed over some wooden bricks that were scattered on the carpet, gave her a kiss and then took Alfie from her. \"Yeah, and guess what? I've finished the job and won't have to work at all this weekend.\" \"Fantastic,\" she said. \"Then it's a double celebration. Because guess who wee'd in her potty today?\" \"Did you, Millie?\" Millie nodded with extraordinary pride, which was only surpassed by that of her mother. \"And you didn't get any on the floor, did you, Millie? Which is better than your daddy usually manages and he's thirty-two.\" I gave Catherine an affectionate poke in the ribs. \"Look, it's not my fault the toilet seat always falls down.\" \"No, it's that idiot who fitted it,\" she concurred, referring to the evening when it had taken me three hours to fit a new wooden toilet seat incorrectly. Millie had obviously enjoyed the praise that had been heaped upon her, so she quickly found another way to get some more attention. \"I done cat drawing,\" she said, presenting me with a scrap of paper, which I took from her and studied carefully. Frankly, Millie's drawing was rubbish. To represent our cat, she had taken the blue crayon and scribbled it up and down on a piece of paper. \"Ooh, Millie, that's a super picture. You are a clever girl.\" One day she would turn round and say, \"Don't patronize me, Father, we both know the picture is crap,\" but for the time being she seemed to buy it. I loved coming home when I hadn't seen them all for a couple of days; they were always so delighted to see me. It was the return of the prodigal father. Catherine grabbed the chance to start clearing up the kitchen as I played with the kids for a while. I played hide and seek with Millie, which was made easier by the fact that she hid in the same spot behind the curtains three times in a row. Then I made Alfie giggle by throwing him up in the air until Catherine came back into the room to see why he'd suddenly started crying. \"I don't know,\" I said, trying not to look up at the metal chandelier swinging back and forth above her head. She took the crying baby back, and at that moment I thought she looked a little tired, so I said I'd take over tidying up. I slipped upstairs, gathering scattered toys as I went. I ran a big foamy bath, turned off the light and lit a couple of candles. Then I placed the portable CD player in the bathroom and put on Beethoven's Pastoral Symphony. \"Catherine, can you just come upstairs a minute,\" I shouted. She came up and surveyed the instant sanctuary that I had created. \"I'll take over the kids and load the dishwasher and everything. You get in there and I'll bring you a glass of wine, and you're not allowed out till the end of the final movement, 'Shepherds Song; Beneficent Feelings After the Storm'.\" She leaned against me. \"Oh, Michael. What have I done to deserve this?\" \"Well, you've been looking after the kids on your own for a couple of days and you must need a bit of space.\" \"Yes, but you've been working hard, too. Don't you need a rest?\" \"I don't work as hard as you,\" I said sincerely. After a few half-hearted guilty protestations she clicked on the heated towel rail and turned up the volume loud enough to drown out the indignant shouts of \"Mummy!\" that had already started to emanate from the kitchen. \"Michael,\" she said as she kissed me on the cheek, \"thanks for being the best husband in the world.\" I smiled a half-smile. When your wife says something like that, it doesn't seem like the right moment to put her straight.",

Leeds have announced record-breaking profits of \u00a33m before interest for the past year. Profits were up by 39% and turnover increased by 54% to \u00a357.1m. George Weah has decided to play Major League Soccer after spending this season with Marseille, despite suggesting earlier in the week that he would retire. \"In June, I'll stop European football and go the United States,\" the Liberian international admitted. Rangers striker Michael Mols could be forced to have a third knee operation to save his career. The Dutchman's comeback from a cruciate ligament injury almost a year ago has been put on hold following a painful build-up of fluid. Former Dundee United striker Alex Mathie has accused captain Jason de Vos of treachery within the dressing room. \"I can only think of one guy I haven't really liked in my career,\" he said. \"Jason isn't very popular with the players because he tells the manager everything. He talks about people behind their back which means he can't really be trusted.\" Dundee have signed Trinidad and Tobago goalkeeper Clayton Ince on a three-month loan. * * * * * * * * * * * * * TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO Sky Sports 1: Live International Schoolboy Football (7.30pm, 12.30am, 4am SS2) Feeling confused is nothing to be ashamed of, you know.

      "body": "<p>I found it hard working really long hours when I was my own boss. The boss kept giving me the afternoon off. Sometimes he gave me the morning off as well. Sometimes he'd say, \"Look, you've worked pretty hard today, why don't you take a well-earned rest tomorrow\". If I overslept he never rang me to ask where I was; if I was late to my desk he always happened to turn up at exactly the same time; whatever excuse I came up with, he always believed it. Being my own boss was great. Being my own employee was a disaster, but I never thought about that side of the equation.</p> <p>On this particular day I was woken by the sound of children. I knew from experience that this meant it was either just before nine o'clock in the morning, when children started arriving at the school over the road, or around quarter past eleven - mid-morning playtime. I rolled over to look at the clock and the little numbers on my radio alarm informed me that it was 1:24. Lunchtime. I had slept for fourteen solid hours, an all-time record.</p> <p>I called it my radio alarm, though in reality it served only as a large and cumbersome clock. I had given up using the radio-alarm function long before, after I'd kept waking up with early morning erections to the news that famine was spreading in the Sudan or that Princess Anne had just had her wisdom teeth out. It's amazing how quickly an erection can disappear. Anyway, alarm clocks are for people who have something more important to do than sleeping, and this was a concept that I struggled to grasp. Some days I would wake up, decide that it wasn't worth getting dressed and then just stay in bed until, well, bedtime. But it wasn't apathetic, what's-the-point-of-getting-up lying in bed, it was positive, quality-of-life lying in bed. I had resolved that leisure time should involve genuine leisure. If it had been up to me there would have been nothing at the Balham Leisure Centre except rows of beds with all the Sunday papers scattered at the bottom of the duvet.</p> <p>My bedroom had evolved so that the need to get out of bed was kept to an absolute minimum. Instead of a bedside table there was a fridge, inside which milk, bread and butter were kept. On top of the fridge was a kettle, which fought for space with a tray of mugs, a box of tea bags, a selection of breakfast cereals, a toaster and an overloaded plug adapter. I clicked on the kettle and popped some bread in the toaster. I reached across for that day's newspaper and was slightly surprised as a set of keys slid off the top and clinked onto the floor. Then I remembered that I hadn't slept for fourteen solid hours after all; there had been a vague but annoying conversation very early that morning. As far as I could remember, it had gone something like this:</p> <p>\"Scuse me, mate?\"</p> <p>\"Uh?\" I replied from under the duvet.</p> <p>\"Excuse me, mate. It's me. Paper boy,\" said the cracking voice of the nervous-sounding teenager.</p> <p>\"What do you want?\"</p> <p>\"My mum says I'm not allowed to deliver the paper to the end of your bed any more.\"</p> <p>\"Why not?\" I groaned, without emerging.</p> <p>\"She says it's weird. I had to stop her ringing ChildLine.\"</p> <p>\"What time is it?\"</p> <p>\"Seven o'clock. I told her you paid me an extra couple of quid a week to bring it up here and everything, but she said it's weird and that I'm only allowed to push it through the letter box, like I do for everyone else. I'll leave your front door keys here.\"</p> <p>If anything had been said after that I didn't remember it. That must have been the moment when I went back to sleep. The clink of the keys brought it back like some half-remembered dream. And as I flicked through the stories of war, violent crime and environmental disaster, I felt a growing sense of depression. Today was the last day I would ever have my newspaper delivered to the end of my bed.</p> <p>Lightly browned toast popped up and the bubbling kettle clicked itself off. The butter and milk were kept on the top shelf of the fridge so they could be reached without leaving the bed. When I'd first bought the fridge and placed it in my room I had sunk to my knees in mortified disbelief. The fridge door opened the wrong way - I couldn't reach the handle from the bed. I tried putting the fridge upside down, but it looked a bit stupid. I tried putting it on the other side of the bed, but then I had to move my keyboard and mixing desk and all the other bits of musical equipment that were packed into my bedroom-cum-recording studio. After several hours spent dragging furniture into different positions around the room, I finally found a location for the bed that would comfortably allow me to take things from the fridge, make breakfast, reach my phone and watch telly without having to do anything as strenuous as standing up. If Boots had marketed a do-it-yourself catheter kit, I would have been the first customer.</p> <p>The only thing more self-indulgent than breakfast in bed is having breakfast in bed at lunchtime. There's a decadence to it that makes lightly buttered toast taste like the food of the gods. I sipped my tea and, with one of several remote controls, switched on the telly just in time to see the beginning of one of my favourite films, Billy Wilder's The Apartment. I'll just watch the first few minutes, I thought to myself as I fluffed up the pillows. Just the bit where he's working in that huge insurance office with hundreds of other people doing exactly the same monotonous job. Forty minutes later my mobile phone jolted me out of my hypnotized trance. I switched the television to mute and removed the mobile from its charger.</p> <p>\"Hello, Michael, it's Hugo Harrison here - from DD and G. I'm just ringing in case you'd forgotten that you said you'd probably be able to get your piece of music to us by the end of today.\" \"Forgotten? Are you joking? I_ve been working on it all week. I_m in the studio right now.\"</p> <p>\"Do you think you'll be able to deliver it when you said?\"</p> <p>\"Hugo, have I ever missed a deadline? I'm just doing a remix, so you'll probably get it around four or five o'clock.\"</p> <p>\"Right.\" Hugo sounded disappointed. \"There's no chance that we might get it before then, because we're sort of hanging around waiting to do the dub.\"</p> <p>\"Well, I'll try. To be honest, I was going to go out and get a bite of lunch, but I'll work through if you need it urgently.\"</p> <p>\"Thanks, Michael. Bloody brilliant. Speak to you later, then.\"</p> <p>And I turned off my mobile, lay back in bed and then watched The Apartment all the way through.</p> <p>What I hadn't told Hugo from DD&amp;G was that I had in fact completed my composition four days earlier, but when someone pays you a thousand pounds for a piece of work, you can't give it to them two days after they commission it. They have to feel they're getting their money's worth. They might have imagined that they wanted it as soon as possible, but I knew that they'd appreciate and enjoy it far more if they thought it had taken me all week.</p> <p>The slogan the agency were going to put over my composition was \"The saloon car that thinks it's a sports car\". So I did a ploddy easy-listening intro which switched into a screeching electric-guitar sound. Saloon car, sports car. Easy-listening for the humdrum lives of all those thirty-something saloon-car drivers and electric guitar for the racy, exciting lives that they are starting to realize have gone for ever. Hugo had thought this was a great idea when I'd put it to him, so much so that fairly quickly he was talking about it as if it was his own.</p> <p>Generally speaking I did every commission straight away, and would then phone the client at regular intervals and say things like, \"Look, I've got something I'm really pleased with, but it's only thirteen seconds long. Does it really have to be exactly fifteen seconds?\" And they'd say, \"Well, if you're really pleased with it, maybe we should have a listen. But is there no way you can make it fifteen? Like, just slow it down a bit or something?\"</p> <p>\"Just slow it down a bit! What are you talking about?\"</p> <p>\"I don't know. I'm not a composer.\"</p> <p>And then I'd pretend to find a solution and the client would hang up feeling reassured that I was still working on it and pleased that they had helped me get that much closer to completion. And all the time a fifteen-second jingle was already on a DAT in my studio. Whenever I had sent ad agencies work straight away, they were always initially enthusiastic, but then came back to me a few days later saying they wanted it changed. I had learned that it was far better to give it to them at the last minute, when they had no choice but to decide that it was great.</p> <p>I had persuaded myself that actually I probably did roughly the same amount of work as many men my age, namely around two or three hours a day. But I was determined that I wouldn't waste the rest of my life pretending to be working, flicking my computer screen from Solitaire to a spreadsheet, or suddenly changing the tone of personal phone calls when the managing director walked into the office. From what I could gather from my contemporaries, there were a lot of jobs where you arrived in the morning, chatted for an hour or two, did some really useful work between about eleven and lunchtime, came back in the afternoon, sent a stupid e-mail message to Gary in accounts before spending the rest of the afternoon in apparent total concentration while downloading a picture of a naked transsexual from http://www.titsandcocks.com.</p> <p>The film was interrupted by adverts and I couldn't help but take a professional interest in the music they employed. The jingle for the Gillette commercial claimed that the new twin-blade swivel head with lubrastrip was \"the best a man can get\". I thought that this was a pretty bold claim for a disposable plastic razor. A new Ferrari maybe or a night in bed with Pamela Anderson might arguably have the edge for most men, but not according to this singer, no, give him a good shave any day of the week. Then The Apartment came back on and I thought, No, this is the best a man can get: just being tucked up warm and cosy, watching a great film with tea and toast and nothing at all to worry about.</p> <p>When people asked me what I did I generally mumbled that I was \"in advertising\". I used to say that I was a composer or a musician, but I found this prompted a level of fascination that wasn't fulfilled when they discovered this meant I'd written the music for the Mr Gearbox ad on Capital Radio. I was a freelance jingle writer - although other people in the business were too pretentious to call them jingles - working at the bottom end of the freelance jingle-writing market. If the man who composed \"Gillette! The best a man can get!\" was the advertising equivalent of Paul McCartney, that made me the drummer for the band that came fifth in last year's Song for Europe.</p> <p>People always presume there's lots of money in advertising, but I was beginning to sense that I was never going to make a fortune writing twenty-second radio jingles, even if I took it upon myself to start working an eight-hour day.</p> <p>There had been a time in my life when I'd really believed I was going to be a millionaire rock star. When I'd left music college I had returned to my home town and formed a group that played in pubs and at university summer balls. Call me immodest, but I think I can honestly say there was a point in the late Eighties when we were the biggest band in Godalming. Then it all fell apart when our drummer left the group because of \"musical differences\". We were musical, he wasn't. Despite being the crappiest drummer I'd ever heard, he had been the most important member of the band because he had been the one with the van. I found you couldn't fit many amplifiers on a moped. After that highpoint I had carried on recording songs and trying to form bands, but now all I had to show for those years was a box of demo tapes and one precious copy of my flexi-disc single.</p> <p>I got out of bed and played this track again as I got dressed. I was still proud of it, and had never quite forgiven John Peel's producer for saying they didn't play flexi-discs. The journey to my place of work involved walking from one side of my bedroom to the other. Before I started I generally preferred to convert the room from bedroom to studio, which involved transforming my bed back into a sofa and removing any socks or underpants that I had left on top of my keyboard. As well as my Roland XP-60, the recording studio side of my room contained a computer, an eighteen-channel mixing desk, a sampler, a reverb unit, a midi-box, several redundant sound modules, amplifiers and tape decks and, behind it all, seven and a half miles of intertwined electrical cable. If you knew nothing at all about music I suppose all this gear might look quite impressive, but the reality was far more chaotic. The more equipment I acquired, the longer I had to search every time a mystery buzz made it impossible to do any work. Generally I relied upon the keyboard, with its built-in sound module and my multi-talented sampler, which would gamely have a stab at the noise produced by most musical instruments. Although there appeared to be a lot of state-of-the-art technology on display, the stuff was either several years out of date or would be by the time I'd worked out how to use it. Because I'd never got round to reading the manuals I was like the owner of a Ferrari who only drove around in first gear.</p> <p>I lumbered into the bathroom and stared in the mirror. During the night the grey strands on the side of my head had fought their way to the front and a whole swathe of hair above my ears had acquired a silvery sheen. Those of the wiry grey variety were thicker and stronger than the wispy dark hairs they were gradually replacing. The greys were still in a minority, but I knew that, like the squirrels of the same depressing colour, once a few had got a foothold eventually all the indigenous hair would be pushed to the brink of extinction, with maybe a couple of breeding colonies remaining on either eyebrow and perhaps a few shy black hairs that would occasionally be spotted peeking out of my nostrils. On the side of my nose a large yellow-headed spot had ripened and was deftly milked with the dexterity that came from nearly twenty years' practice. In my teens I think I'd presumed there would be a golden period in my life after my spots cleared up and before my hair started to turn grey. Now I realized that was hopelessly naive of me; in my early thirties I was already past my physical peak. The summer seems to have only just begun when you realize the nights are already drawing in. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/firstchapters/story/0,6761,385633,00.html\">Continues</a></p>",

Hugo had thought this was a great idea when I'd put it to him, so much so that fairly quickly he was talking about it as if it was his own. Generally speaking I did every commission straight away, and would then phone the client at regular intervals and say things like, \"Look, I've got something I'm really pleased with, but it's only thirteen seconds long. Does it really have to be exactly fifteen seconds?\" And they'd say, \"Well, if you're really pleased with it, maybe we should have a listen. But is there no way you can make it fifteen? Like, just slow it down a bit or something?\" \"Just slow it down a bit! What are you talking about?\" \"I don't know. I'm not a composer.\" And then I'd pretend to find a solution and the client would hang up feeling reassured that I was still working on it and pleased that they had helped me get that much closer to completion. And all the time a fifteen-second jingle was already on a DAT in my studio. Whenever I had sent ad agencies work straight away, they were always initially enthusiastic, but then came back to me a few days later saying they wanted it changed. I had learned that it was far better to give it to them at the last minute, when they had no choice but to decide that it was great. I had persuaded myself that actually I probably did roughly the same amount of work as many men my age, namely around two or three hours a day. But I was determined that I wouldn't waste the rest of my life pretending to be working, flicking my computer screen from Solitaire to a spreadsheet, or suddenly changing the tone of personal phone calls when the managing director walked into the office. From what I could gather from my contemporaries, there were a lot of jobs where you arrived in the morning, chatted for an hour or two, did some really useful work between about eleven and lunchtime, came back in the afternoon, sent a stupid e-mail message to Gary in accounts before spending the rest of the afternoon in apparent total concentration while downloading a picture of a naked transsexual from http://www.titsandcocks.com. The film was interrupted by adverts and I couldn't help but take a professional interest in the music they employed. The jingle for the Gillette commercial claimed that the new twin-blade swivel head with lubrastrip was \"the best a man can get\". I thought that this was a pretty bold claim for a disposable plastic razor. A new Ferrari maybe or a night in bed with Pamela Anderson might arguably have the edge for most men, but not according to this singer, no, give him a good shave any day of the week. Then The Apartment came back on and I thought, No, this is the best a man can get: just being tucked up warm and cosy, watching a great film with tea and toast and nothing at all to worry about. When people asked me what I did I generally mumbled that I was \"in advertising\". I used to say that I was a composer or a musician, but I found this prompted a level of fascination that wasn't fulfilled when they discovered this meant I'd written the music for the Mr Gearbox ad on Capital Radio. I was a freelance jingle writer - although other people in the business were too pretentious to call them jingles - working at the bottom end of the freelance jingle-writing market. If the man who composed \"Gillette! The best a man can get!\" was the advertising equivalent of Paul McCartney, that made me the drummer for the band that came fifth in last year's Song for Europe. People always presume there's lots of money in advertising, but I was beginning to sense that I was never going to make a fortune writing twenty-second radio jingles, even if I took it upon myself to start working an eight-hour day. There had been a time in my life when I'd really believed I was going to be a millionaire rock star. When I'd left music college I had returned to my home town and formed a group that played in pubs and at university summer balls. Call me immodest, but I think I can honestly say there was a point in the late Eighties when we were the biggest band in Godalming. Then it all fell apart when our drummer left the group because of \"musical differences\". We were musical, he wasn't. Despite being the crappiest drummer I'd ever heard, he had been the most important member of the band because he had been the one with the van. I found you couldn't fit many amplifiers on a moped. After that highpoint I had carried on recording songs and trying to form bands, but now all I had to show for those years was a box of demo tapes and one precious copy of my flexi-disc single. I got out of bed and played this track again as I got dressed. I was still proud of it, and had never quite forgiven John Peel's producer for saying they didn't play flexi-discs. The journey to my place of work involved walking from one side of my bedroom to the other. Before I started I generally preferred to convert the room from bedroom to studio, which involved transforming my bed back into a sofa and removing any socks or underpants that I had left on top of my keyboard. As well as my Roland XP-60, the recording studio side of my room contained a computer, an eighteen-channel mixing desk, a sampler, a reverb unit, a midi-box, several redundant sound modules, amplifiers and tape decks and, behind it all, seven and a half miles of intertwined electrical cable. If you knew nothing at all about music I suppose all this gear might look quite impressive, but the reality was far more chaotic. The more equipment I acquired, the longer I had to search every time a mystery buzz made it impossible to do any work. Generally I relied upon the keyboard, with its built-in sound module and my multi-talented sampler, which would gamely have a stab at the noise produced by most musical instruments. Although there appeared to be a lot of state-of-the-art technology on display, the stuff was either several years out of date or would be by the time I'd worked out how to use it. Because I'd never got round to reading the manuals I was like the owner of a Ferrari who only drove around in first gear. I lumbered into the bathroom and stared in the mirror. During the night the grey strands on the side of my head had fought their way to the front and a whole swathe of hair above my ears had acquired a silvery sheen. Those of the wiry grey variety were thicker and stronger than the wispy dark hairs they were gradually replacing. The greys were still in a minority, but I knew that, like the squirrels of the same depressing colour, once a few had got a foothold eventually all the indigenous hair would be pushed to the brink of extinction, with maybe a couple of breeding colonies remaining on either eyebrow and perhaps a few shy black hairs that would occasionally be spotted peeking out of my nostrils. On the side of my nose a large yellow-headed spot had ripened and was deftly milked with the dexterity that came from nearly twenty years' practice. In my teens I think I'd presumed there would be a golden period in my life after my spots cleared up and before my hair started to turn grey. Now I realized that was hopelessly naive of me; in my early thirties I was already past my physical peak. The summer seems to have only just begun when you realize the nights are already drawing in.

      "bodyText": "The distorting telescope of Middle East reporting, which always magnifies your own side's grievances and diminishes the other's, is on view in the Israeli papers following the bloody gunbattle between Jewish settlers and Palestinians. The Ha'aretz daily opens its coverage: \"One settler was killed and four were wounded yesterday when Palestinians opened fire on a tour bus on Mount Eval, near Nablus, igniting a battle with the Israel Defense Forces that lasted for more than five hours.\" It goes on to report the grave fears of political and military leaders about the implications for the ceasefire, and their doubts about the Palestinians' willingness to observe it. Only six paragraphs later, and in passing, do readers learn that a Palestinian was also killed, and up to 20 wounded. The Jerusalem Post is also in no doubt who is to blame for the latest gunbattle. It features an analysis suggesting that Palestinian president Yasser Arafat is deliberately stoking up the violence in advance of the Arab summit in Cairo this weekend. \"The Palestinian leader hopes the summit will end with a resolution that can boost his popularity at home, internationalise the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, and somehow increase his chances of achieving a better deal with Israel if peace talks resume,\" writes Janine Zacharia. The view from the other end of the telescope is, of course, quite different. There is little press coverage from within Palestine on Friday, the Islamic sabbath, but the Jordan Times has an extensive report of the latest clashes, stressing the gross imbalance between Palestinian and Israeli firepower, and quoting local officials' claims that the Nablus gunbattle was started by the Israelis. The Jordan Times also has a detailed analysis of the forthcoming Arab summit, which is expected to expose deep divisions among regional leaders, with moderates trying to shore up the crumbling peace process and hardline states like Syria calling for a renewed diplomatic and trade boycott of Israel. The seething popular mood of the region is underlined by the Cairo Times , which focuses on unruly demonstrations in Egypt by \"normally quiescent\" students. The Gulf News in Dubai issues an almost certainly forlorn call for Arab unity. \"The Arab summit in Cairo this weekend has to spell out to the world a clear and united position from all the Arab nations that what is happening in Palestine, and Jerusalem in particular, is totally outrageous. \"The summit should come to some specific resolutions which hurt Israel, and force others to recognise the Arab fury at what has been evident over the past weeks.\"",

Although, later, he said the government's policy had not changed. It is still to \"prepare and decide\" before putting the issue of British membership before the public to vote on. The chancellor, Gordon Brown, sets great store by the five economic \"tests\" he has devised to determine whether the time is right to join and will not advocate membership until these criteria have been met. </p> <p><b> What, then, is the significance of the prime minister's most recent remarks? </b> <br> The importance of Mr Blair's comments is they appear to signal, at least, a subtle but vital change of approach and tone, if not policy. They show he is not now willing to risk losing political ground by trying to improve the public's perception of the euro. As well as the blow of the Danish referendum, the value of the euro has been falling against the dollar despite central bank attempts to prop it up. On Wednesday this week, the euro fell to a record low of 83.25 US cents. The pro-single currency in the cabinet had been pushing for a more upbeat approach from the government on joining, led by the foreign secretary, Robin Cook, a keen supporter of Europe. But Mr Blair has now shown he is firmly behind Mr Brown, whose strategy is to avoid making the euro an election issue. </p> <p><b> Why is it such a thorny political issue? </b> <br> Because opinion polls show voters are against joining monetary union by more than 2-1. But there exists, in the Labour party, broad support for the belief it is the right thing to do. Mr Blair's remarks will help him avoid making the euro an election issue and must diminish the prospects of a post-election referendum. The feeling among commentators is Mr Blair will only hold one if he feels he can win it. The Conservative leader, William Hague, reacted to his comments by accusing Mr Blair of \"attempting to abandon his own policy\" in an attempt to camouflage his plans to scrap the pound. Mr Blair is worried at Mr Hague's capacity to exploit public disquiet at the euro.</p> <p><b> So were the comments a shrewd move? </b> <br> On balance, perhaps they were. But by apparently throwing his support behind Mr Brown's euro approach, Mr Blair risks aggravating splits on the issue in the cabinet. Mr Blair's main objective is keeping a united front. He is all too aware that division on the euro helped tear the Tory party apart when they were in power. Mr Brown and others are unenthusiastic about the prospect of membership (though none seems to want to rule it out altogether). </p> <p>Others, such as the Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Mandelson, and Mr Cook, believe the government must speak out about the possible benefits of membership if it is to have any chance of persuading the public to vote for it in a referendum. That said, neither the chancellor nor the foreign secretary thinks that Britain should join the single currency immediately, and neither of them wants to rule it out all altogether. </p> <p><b> So they really agree? </b> <br> Not quite. Robin Cook and Gordon Brown might agree about the broad sweep of policy towards the euro, but they certainly disagree when it comes to the matter of tone. The chancellor's early enthusiasm for the single currency, in 1997 and 1998, has been replaced by a cautious neutrality. In contrast, the foreign secretary - always a pro-European - has become openly keen on joining. A draft of a speech he gave earlier this year, for instance, included a promise that the government \"would not let Britain lose by staying out\" - words the chancellor would be unlikely to use. </p> <p><b> Is the government dangerously split on the issue, then? </b> <br> To a degree. Apart from the foreign secretary, two other leading ministers, Mandelson and trade secretary Stephen Byers, would like the government to be more openly enthusiastic about the euro. But the real issue is not a fundamental split between pro-Europeans and anti-Europeans, but a concern on the part of pro-Europeans that the single currency is not an issue on which the government should or can remain neutral. </p> <p><b> Do Mr Blair's comments restrict his ability to be flexible on the euro? </b> <br> One reaction to his remarks on the euro which will worry Mr Blair is that of the Business for Sterling chief executive, Nick Herbert.

The Nasdaq composite has fallen more than 20% since September 20. </p> <p>\"The US market has been friendless for the past six months,\" Mr Bradshaw said. </p> <p>The saying that when Nasdaq sneezes technology stocks around the globe become flu cases has never been more apt. </p> <p>There are other influences at work in Britain. The collapse of the likes of Boo.com, Boxman and ClickMango hardly helped sentiment. Institutional investors appear to have deserted many UK internet stocks. \"In this sort of environment you look for companies with visible earnings and cash flow,\" said one analyst at another major investment bank. </p> <p>\"If you are a fund manager you don't want to have to explain to your investors why you're sitting on some dot.com shares that are a mile under water. OK, at these levels they may double but equally they may halve again and it's not worth the risk.\" </p> <p>The relentless selling of QXL.com shows how sentiment can destroy a stock and how little there is underpinning the shares. Earlier in the year it was confidently using its high share price to drive consolidation in the internet auction space and was on the way to becoming a credible rival to eBay. But when its share price collapsed so did its acquisition strategy. </p> <p>Analysts say its share price has probably fallen too far but if it remains there the company will not be able to raise the cash it needs to take it through to profitability. eBay could let the shares fall further then pick up QXL at a bargain price. </p> <p>As Lastminute.com has shown, a share price can continue to fall even if the business plan is being executed ahead of expectations and there is enough money to see the venture through to profitability. Freeserve faces similar issues. Motivating staff whose own share options are almost valueless is an added difficulty. </p> <p>Merrill Lynch believes some of the thousands of private investors sitting on big paper losses could yet get their money back. \"There is a light at the end of the tunnel for some of these companies but the trend for the next few months is likely to be flat or downwards,\" Mr Bradshaw said. </p> <p>For others, the internet boom will have been a painful investment lesson.</p>",

The collapse of the likes of Boo.com, Boxman and ClickMango hardly helped sentiment. Institutional investors appear to have deserted many UK internet stocks. \"In this sort of environment you look for companies with visible earnings and cash flow,\" said one analyst at another major investment bank. \"If you are a fund manager you don't want to have to explain to your investors why you're sitting on some dot.com shares that are a mile under water. OK, at these levels they may double but equally they may halve again and it's not worth the risk.\" The relentless selling of QXL.com shows how sentiment can destroy a stock and how little there is underpinning the shares. Earlier in the year it was confidently using its high share price to drive consolidation in the internet auction space and was on the way to becoming a credible rival to eBay. But when its share price collapsed so did its acquisition strategy. Analysts say its share price has probably fallen too far but if it remains there the company will not be able to raise the cash it needs to take it through to profitability. eBay could let the shares fall further then pick up QXL at a bargain price. As Lastminute.com has shown, a share price can continue to fall even if the business plan is being executed ahead of expectations and there is enough money to see the venture through to profitability. Freeserve faces similar issues. Motivating staff whose own share options are almost valueless is an added difficulty. Merrill Lynch believes some of the thousands of private investors sitting on big paper losses could yet get their money back. \"There is a light at the end of the tunnel for some of these companies but the trend for the next few months is likely to be flat or downwards,\" Mr Bradshaw said. For others, the internet boom will have been a painful investment lesson.",

The New Look [of 1947] was not a new look; Dior was doing the clothes of the 1860s, the 1870s, those fitted coats with the peplum. He changed it, but that was the influence. Even disco clothes and Versace in the 80s, they were almost Grecian or Roman, so I don't think there's anything new.\" </p> <p>One could forgive Sui, though, if she has a bit of a gloat in private. After all, her fashion has been looking over its shoulder since she started her label in 1980. Unlike the current ironic references to fashion from the past, Sui's clothes have no time for tongue-in-cheek homages. From the sweetest and wispiest of chiffon dresses to velvet BoHo jackets, these are clothes that look as though they actually come from the vintage store and from the decades to which they refer. And not at too fashion-fantastic prices: a dress will cost you roughly \u00a3200. </p> <p>It was not until the early 90s that New York's fashion scene was able to accommodate Sui rather than relegate her to outsider status. Her pretty floral dresses and shiny trousers provided an oasis of colour in the sea of sleek black polo-necks and tasteful wide-leg trousers that, until a few years ago, dominated New York fashion. (Surprisingly, this was exactly the outfit Sui was wearing when we met.) </p> <p>Her first catwalk show was in 1991, over 10 years after she launched her signature line - \"It took a while for me to get the confidence!\" Ever since, her little tea dresses, skinny-leg trousers and rock star-style slashed bustiers have been spotted on the likes of Madonna, Christina Ricci and Jennifer Lopez. It is a style that proclaims the wearer is, quite frankly, cooler than you: here is a girl (or guy - Sui does a limited men's range) who doesn't kowtow to fashion dictators. Here is someone with vintage nous and here is a little thing they just, oh, you know, found in a flea market outside Berlin. Her flagship boutique in New York's SoHo showcases finds from her vintage hunts around the world, alongside her clothes, shoes and recently launched cosmetics and perfume range. It is small, dark, and probably described as \"a treasure trove\" in shopping guidebooks. </p> <p>Sui's solemn appearance is at odds with her reputation as the rock chick of fashion - one of her closest friends is James Iha of the Smashing Pumpkins and Anita Pallenberg turned up at her recent perfume launch in London. Her voice, too, is not what one might expect from the designer of babydoll dresses and frilly viscose skirts - she has a low monotone, which muffles the potential mumbo jumbo-like nature of some of her statements (\"I try to transport my designs into the space I aim to create\"). In the main, though, she is cogent, plain-speaking and very intelligent. </p> <p>So what does Sui think of this return to the 80s? \"It seems the twentysomething generation is always looking for some kind of rebellion, choosing something other people aren't quite going to understand,\" she says, smiling benevolently. \"And I think the mall fashion of the 80s was pretty wretched back then. So for people to make it kind of cool makes it kitsch, I guess ... When it doesn't work, then hopefully it will go away.\" Which, from polite American PR-speak into English, translates as, let's hope the madness ends soon. </p> <p>Sui's approach to fashion is itself in vogue: aside from the culling of decades, her intellectualisation of design is now seen as respectable and right rather than eccentric. Just look at the adulation ladled on conceptual designers such as London's self-consciously cerebal Hussein Chalayan. Sui's work always has direct references (like last season's Fauvist collection) and is thoroughly researched. For her 1996 English Arts and Crafts collection, Sui visited Sissinghurst and Charleston, homes of Vita Sackville-West and Vanessa Bell. \"I see it as part of my continuing education,\" Sui says, smiling shyly. \"I feel that, y'know, maybe I missed out not going to a proper college, spending four years studying fashion. So now I research everything that interests me.\" </p> <p> It is not just in the fashion world that Sui has laboured under the tag \"different\". Born in 1955, she was the only daughter of first generation Chinese immigrants in Detroit, the sole Chinese family in the neighbourhood. \"It kind of made us a novelty,\" she says, with a fading Midwest twang. \"It set us aside a little and it kind of worked for us rather than against.\" </p> <p>Even within her family, Sui stood out. While in the 70s her brothers were training to be stockbrokers in Michigan, Sui was hitting the New York underground punk scene with a vengeance and training to be a fashion designer at Parsons School of Design. </p> <p>It was the music scene that helped Sui lose the \"unusual and eccentric\" tag. The babydoll dresses and fishnet tights she showed in 1994 dovetailed perfectly with the growing American grunge scene - as that doyenne of grunge, Courtney Love, recognised. </p> <p>\"That was such an exciting time,\" Sui says. \"One day I got a call from the shop saying Courtney was there and she'd turned it into a teenage girl's bedroom - there were clothes everywhere and she was getting dressed in the middle of the room. She said: 'Anna should call me about designing these clothes, I know about these clothes.' So the shop assistant got on the phone, we got on so well, you know, had dinner that night.\" </p> <p>This was not the first time Sui had been helped out by someone in the public eye. Her dresses were first brought into the spotlight when her friends Naomi Campbell and Linda Evangelista sported them while running between fashion shows in Paris a decade ago.

Just as fashion is returning to the 80s, so is its hierarchy. The difference for Sui this time around is that she is being feted alongside them. In fact, in what was largely a heavily criticised New York fashion week, Sui stood out as being one of the few designers not derided for blandness or lack of imagination. To be different is to be celebrated. </p> <p>As Sui leaves, she suddenly adds a final, unexpected thought: \"Y'know, this 80s fashion is really just nostalgia.

      "byline": "Bill Drysdale",

      "body": "<p>A great problem for today's dance students aspiring to careers in musical theatre is the shortage of role models. Gwen Verdon, who has died aged 75, was one of the last great exponents, with direct experience - both as a performer and choreographic muse to her late husband, Bob Fosse - of a dance tradition which traces its roots back to the work of Jack Cole, whom she assisted in the 1940s.</p> <p>For the last two decades, the Broadway music tradition, embodied by Oklahoma! and nurtured by director/choreographers such as Agnes de Mille, Gower Champion, Jerome Robbins, Joe Layton and Fosse himself, has been deposed by the British musical, owing more to the traditions of European operetta.</p> <p>So the extraordinarily successful revival of Chicago - Verdon was its original Roxie Hart in 1975 - followed by the show, Fosse, has been a revelation of the extraordinary standards of dance creativity that prevailed in musicals after the second world war. It was Verdon's tireless industry, and devotion to her husband's memory, that enabled these revivals to materialise.</p> <p>She was born in Culver City, California, the daughter of British-born parents. Her father was an MGM technician, and her mother, who had trained with the modern-dance company Denishawn, opened her own school. Verdon, her legs weakened by childhood illness, got her early dance training from Ernest Belcher, who also trained Cyd Charisse.</p> <p>Initially, she followed her first husband, James Henaghan, into journalism, reviewing films and nightclub acts. The marriage was over by 1947, but thus it was that she discovered the work of jazz-dance pioneer Cole, and eventually joined his nightclub act. Later, she became his assistant, replacing Carol Haney, who left to work with Gene Kelly.</p> <p>Cole choreographed Verdon's Broadway debut revue, Alive And Kicking (1950), which flopped. She was not ambitious to be a star, preferring her role of choreographer's assistant, but Cole was a volatile and abusive task master, and, eventually, she took refuge with Michael Kidd, starring on Broadway in Can-Can (1953) - for which she received dazzling reviews and a Tony award.

      "bodyText": "A great problem for today's dance students aspiring to careers in musical theatre is the shortage of role models. Gwen Verdon, who has died aged 75, was one of the last great exponents, with direct experience - both as a performer and choreographic muse to her late husband, Bob Fosse - of a dance tradition which traces its roots back to the work of Jack Cole, whom she assisted in the 1940s. For the last two decades, the Broadway music tradition, embodied by Oklahoma! and nurtured by director/choreographers such as Agnes de Mille, Gower Champion, Jerome Robbins, Joe Layton and Fosse himself, has been deposed by the British musical, owing more to the traditions of European operetta. So the extraordinarily successful revival of Chicago - Verdon was its original Roxie Hart in 1975 - followed by the show, Fosse, has been a revelation of the extraordinary standards of dance creativity that prevailed in musicals after the second world war. It was Verdon's tireless industry, and devotion to her husband's memory, that enabled these revivals to materialise. She was born in Culver City, California, the daughter of British-born parents. Her father was an MGM technician, and her mother, who had trained with the modern-dance company Denishawn, opened her own school. Verdon, her legs weakened by childhood illness, got her early dance training from Ernest Belcher, who also trained Cyd Charisse. Initially, she followed her first husband, James Henaghan, into journalism, reviewing films and nightclub acts. The marriage was over by 1947, but thus it was that she discovered the work of jazz-dance pioneer Cole, and eventually joined his nightclub act. Later, she became his assistant, replacing Carol Haney, who left to work with Gene Kelly. Cole choreographed Verdon's Broadway debut revue, Alive And Kicking (1950), which flopped. She was not ambitious to be a star, preferring her role of choreographer's assistant, but Cole was a volatile and abusive task master, and, eventually, she took refuge with Michael Kidd, starring on Broadway in Can-Can (1953) - for which she received dazzling reviews and a Tony award. For Fosse, she starred as Lola in Damn Yankees (1955), won another Tony, and repeated her performance in the 1958 movie. As a performer, Verdon had a unique quality of comic sexuality. This protected her endearingly innocent, vulnerable personality from slipping into outright vulgarity - unlike Fosse, who frequently strayed into conflict with his producers through his highly individual attitudes to portraying sexuality in dance. During her time with Cole, Verdon made minor dancing appearances in movies, coached Jane Russell, and taught Marilyn Monroe the steps for her number in the movie Gentleman Prefer Blondes. She was perfect casting for the role of Charity in Sweet Charity (1966), the musical based on Fellini's 1957 film, Le Notte Di Cabiria. Her other leads in musicals were New Girl In Town (1958), and Redhead (1959), both choreographed by Fosse, the latter show directed by him, and both winning Tonys for Verdon. When her dancing career was over, she also found success as a character actress, in such films as Cocoon (1985), The Cotton Club (1984) and Woody Allen's Alice (1990). She had married Fosse in 1960, but he was a notorious womaniser (a fact he made no secret of in his autobiographical film, All That Jazz), though despite their agreeing to live apart, he and Verdon were never divorced. She remained devoted to the man and his work, and was with him when he died of a heart attack during a tour of a revival of Sweet Charity in 1987.

The world must do all it can to avert a serious US recession which could prove very contagious.

      "bodyText": "A concerted effort to undermine the benign image of last month's fuel protesters was mounted yesterday as the government, police, oil companies and tanker drivers' union combined to produce a catalogue of intimidation during the protests. The home secretary, Jack Straw, said such intimidation came close to thuggery and would not be tolerated again. Fuel protesters angrily attacked the claims as rubbish and claimed they were timed to distract from yesterday's 2p increase in the price of a litre of unleaded petrol to 81.9p, with 4p on a litre of diesel. The oil companies blamed the rise on the price of crude. However, at the fifth meeting of the government's fuel taskforce yesterday, the oil companies for the first time charted 180 separate incidents, including bricks through drivers' windows and attacks on tanker drivers at home. The catalogue of incidents, apparently confirmed by the police, was matched by a separate dossier, prepared by the Transport and General Workers Union, recording 30 incidents. Bill Morris, the TGWU general secretary, said that in the event of a repetition of the protests he was confident the police and the oil companies would use tougher criminal and civil sanctions. In recent talks with the oil company managers, he was told the companies had been reluctant to use the courts to remove the protesters for fear of exacerbating the crisis. Mr Straw described the incidents of intimidation discussed at the meeting as shocking. He claimed: \"The protesting went beyond the bounds of a peaceful protest and ended, in a few cases, at straightforward thuggery. \"It was not a peaceful protest as some of them persuaded us it was. The kind of action that took place last time is quite intolerable,\" he warned. Chris Fox, of the Association of Chief Police Officers, said: \"Intimidation, bullying and thuggery won't be tolerated.\" He promised that future policing would be more \"vigorous\". The attack on the protesters came as leading freight and farmers' groups lobbied the government for a 15p cut in diesel fuel. David Handley, chairman of the People's Fuel Protest, said the claims of intimidation were \"absolute and utter rubbish\". Accusing the TGWU of being in collusion with the government, he said: \"There is something very, very sinister here. In view of the way the T&amp;G leadership supported the government during the blockades, you have to ask what is going on.\" \"If it was true, why has it taken so long for these people to come up with their evidence.\" His group, which is trying to co-ordinate the protesters, has had a rethink on further blockades and is now proposing a mass demonstration in London scheduled for mid-November, the end of their 60-day deadline. They have also rejected suggestions of trying to shut down the national grid or blockading train depots. The chancellor, Gordon Brown, is studying a range of options to cut fuel duty in the pre-Budget report due in the next few weeks. The recent rise in oil prices boosts the government's revenues, but the Treasury appears to be resistant to demands for a big cut in the price of duty for the general motorist. The 15p cut in duty sought by the Freight Transport Association and the National Farmers Union would cost \u00a31.5bn.",

      "bodyText": "A political storm engulfed Italy's Rai state TV network yesterday after its Jerusalem correspondent was accused of betraying a rival network which captured shocking footage of Palestinians lynching two Israeli soldiers. Institutional anti-semitism and professional jealousy were blamed for Riccardo Cristiano's decision to effectively identify Mediaset journalists in an open letter to Yasser Arafat's Palestinian authority. Accusing him of informing, Mediaset said it had been forced to withdraw staff exposed to revenge attacks from Palestinians furious with a broadcast that helped Israeli forces to arrest several of the alleged killers. Security sources in Israel said the frames taken from the film were crucial in allowing Israel's Shin Bet security service to track down the culprits. The two soldiers, middle-aged reservists, blundered into the West Bank town of Ramallah last Thursday. They were detained in the local police station but then killed by a mob. One of those reportedly captured is seen in the film standing at the window of the station with his bloodied hands raised in triumph to signal to the crowd below that the soldiers had been killed. In Italy, the uproar was a pre-election boon to Silvio Berlusconi, head of the centre-right opposition and owner of Mediaset. A spokesman for his party, Forza Italia, said: \"The letter is indicative of an anti-semitic attitude in elements of the Italian left.\" Rai disowned the letter and recalled Mr Cristiano to Italy but the network's credibility had crumbled, said commentators. Declaring a day of shame for Italian journalism, Corriere della Sera said the incident was hateful, unacceptable, unethical and irresponsible. \"It is an extremely grave error, without precedent.\" Unlike most other networks Mediaset avoided having film confiscated by Palestinian police after the killings. According to Rai, Mr Cristiano, who was wounded in the head while covering earlier riots, wanted to dispel rumours that a Rai crew was responsible. In a letter published in Al Hayat al Jadida, an official Palestinian newspaper, he said: \"Let us emphasise that it is not at all the case, as we respect the work arrangements between journalists and the Palestinian authority. \"Thank you, and rest assured that this is not our way, and we would never do such a thing.\" The deputy head of Rai's Jerusalem bureau went on to offer congratulations and \"dear blessings\" to his \"dear friends in Palestine\". He accused an unnamed rival Italian agency of having produced the film, referring to the killings as \"the events.\" Israel's government press office suspended Mr Cristiano's credentials after Israel's ambassador to Rome officially protested. \"Mr Cristiano also wrote that his competitors in the Italian media are responsible for broadcasting the pictures of the lynching and thereby accused other foreign journalists working in the territories,\" it said. Rai announced that it was immediately recalling Mr Cristiano to Rome. \"He will no longer work from Jerusalem. Rai had no knowledge of the letter and its content.\" Useful links Madeleine Albright's office Yasser Arafat's office Ehud Barak's office Israeli government Palestinian National Authority Egyptian presidency Hamas",

The Tory amendments, supported by the Ulster Unionists, will be debated during the bill's committee stage next week and during its report stage the week after. They introduce fundamental differences between the government's bill and the Patten report on the future of policing in Northern Ireland. The amendments would: \u0095 Perpetuate the RUC by adding the name to the police force's new title, the Police Service of Northern Ireland; \u0095 Ban members of Sinn Fein and the political wings of the Ulster Defence Association and the Ulster Volunteer Force from sitting on local police boards until the IRA, UDA and UVF disarm; \u0095 Ban anyone convicted of any offence that led to imprisonment from sitting on the boards; \u0095 Restrict the powers of the district policing partnerships so that they cannot make the district commander accountable to them; and \u0095 Retain the RUC emblem and flag. Lord Glentoran, the Conservative spokesman for Northern Ireland, said last night that the government had to offer further concessions to Ulster Unionists to save David Trimble's position as leader of the party. He could be unseated at an emergency meeting of the party's ruling council on October 28. Lord Glentoran said: \"Mr Trimble is the only show in town and he needs to be protected. Without him, the peace process collapses. The government has got to go much further.\" Government sources last night accused the Tories of attempting to bring down the police bill. \"If the Tories pull the bill down they would pull down one of the central planks of the Good Friday agreement,\" one source said. \"If we do not pass the Patten bill before the Queen's speech [at the end of November] the whole agreement could unravel.\" Ministers hope to win the support of Liberal Democrat peers by offering concessions on the recommendation by Chris Patten, the former Tory minister, that there be 50-50 recruitment of Catholics and Protestants. Lib Dems were concerned that a shortfall in Catholic recruitment one year could lead to 100% Catholic recruitment the following year. The government has tabled an amendment which says recruitment from one community cannot exceed 75% in any year. The arithmetic in the Lords is against the government: the Conservatives have 232 peers, Labour 200, and the Lib Dems 63. The 164 cross-bench peers could play a decisive role. Andrew Mackay, the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, last night denied that the Tories were attempting to undermine the peace process. \"We are not breaching Patten, we are just coming at it from a slightly different angle,\" he said.",

Sources within Balfour Beatty, the rail maintenance company responsible for the east coast main line on which the accident occurred, said wear and tear had been noticed last December.

Sam Hall, 33, admitted taking the blame for her female lover, who was at the wheel of a police car involved in a collision with another car. She admitted lying to her superiors by telling them she was driving at the time, but told Norwich crown court she was frightened other officers would find out about the relationship. Sergeant Hall, a policeman's daughter who joined Norfolk constabulary aged 18, said she had suffered for years from a \"whispering campaign\" which had often left her suicidal. The abuse worsened when she was made race and gay liaison officer in September last year, a post described in court as a poisoned chalice. The jury of eight men and four women took an hour to decide she had not intended to pervert the course of justice when she lied about the crash. In criticism of the attitudes of some officers in the Norfolk force, Judge Paul Downes said: \"It is alarming that in the year 2000 people are still prepared to give people a hard time about their sexuality, even in Norfolk, even in a police station. Even though I recognise there have been enormous efforts from the force to combat this, it is still alarming. \"Myself and the jury took the view that the incident was entirely prompted by worries about the possible repeat of the conduct and behaviour shown to her on previous occasions about her sexual orientation.\" The court heard that Sgt Hall and her companion, Carol Jones, were returning on October 17 from a conference in Oxford on the issue of challenging homophobia when the accident happened.

Ms Jones was prosecuted for careless driving in June in connection with the crash. After the verdict on Sgt Hall, whose address cannot be published for legal reasons, she hit out at the \"evil\" attitudes in society towards gay people. She added that she wanted to return to her post. Sgt Hall's solicitor, Simon Nicholls, said: \"No words can even come close to describing the horror of the last year for Sam Hall. \"The immediate return of this officer to full duty doing the job she loves will be just the tonic she needs.\" The Norfolk chief constable, Ken Williams, confirmed that she could return to the force, which he said had made great strides in race and minority group relations, ironically an achievement spearheaded by the sergeant. \"Inevitably in a constabulary of over 1,400 police and over 600 civilian staff we have a broad church of views, but we will purge the constabulary for those who hold homophobic views,\" he said. \"There is a very clear message from me that those who engage in activities such as this put their jobs at risk.\" He said he would be writing to the police complaints authority, which has a duty to consider the case, recommending that Sgt Hall should not be disciplined further over the matter.",

Cementing his avuncular image, he's magnanimous whenever Letterman is mentioned. \"Let's face it, this isn't one of those steel-cage death matches,' he once told an interviewer. Perhaps not, but as celebrity death matches go, Leno v Letterman is much more interesting than Gore v Bush. Stay tuned for round three...",

The company's chairman, Sir John Banham, said: \"We have a very attractive set of businesses going forward and we want to devote all our attention to that. We will not be able to do that, and do justice to our pubs and bars.\"</p> <p>The group will return 75% of the proceeds to investors by the middle of next year, through a special dividend or a share buyback. The rump of the business, dubbed \"Future Whitbread\", will include Pizza Hut, Cafe Rouge and Beefeater restaurants, the Marriott and Travel Inn hotel chains and David Lloyd Leisure sports clubs.</p> <p>The company has already sold its breweries and its share in the off-licence business First Quench this year. Chief executive David Thomas, who has been criticised in the past for lacking a clear strategy, wants to specialise on a small number of nationwide leisure brands.</p> <p>Whitbread's shares jumped 37.5p to 468.25p as the City welcomed the restructuring. Analyst Charles Winston of Schroder Salomon Smith Barney said: \"It's a brave move from a company which has not made enough brave moves in the past, and I applaud that.\"</p> <p>By last night, the number of expressions of interest in Whitbread's pubs had reached double figures. However, there were concerns that the price for the estate may not reach initial estimates of \u00a31.5bn, because of a glut of pubs on the market. Rival leisure group Bass is looking for buyers for hundreds of its neighbourhood houses, and troubled regional players such as Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley Breweries are considered to be willing sellers.</p> <p>Britain's two biggest pub owners, Punch Taverns and Nomura, which both have more than 5,000 outlets, are both interested. Punch's chairman, Hugh Osmond, said: \"I'm sure we'll have a look at them. When the last of the big guys gets out, I think it's a signal that the market's turning upwards.\"</p> <p>Punch beat Whitbread in an acrimonious battle to buy Allied Domecq's 3,500 pubs last year. The defeat led to a turning point in the leisure group's strategy.</p> <p>Ted Tuppen, chief executive of Enterprise Inns, said he had \"plenty of cash available\" and would examine Whitbread's 1,710 leased and tenanted pubs. There were also said to be many possible financial buyers.</p> <p>However, news of the sale was greeted with dismay by purists. The Campaign for Real Ale pointed out that under the ownership of a former brewer, Whitbread's tenanted pubs were entitled to stock a local \"guest beer\". Under new ownership, landlords could face \"strong-arm tactics\" to sign new leases, obliging them to stick to drinks from just a handful of big suppliers.</p> <p>The campaign's research manager, Iain Loe, said: \"They are betraying people who've worked hardest for them, just to follow some get-rich quick tactic of buying hotels.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Britain's biggest landlords were running their slide rules over Whitbread's 3,000 pubs and bars last night, after the leisure company signalled its intention to sell its \u00a31.5bn estate in order to concentrate on restaurants, health clubs and hotels. Japanese bank Nomura, privately owned Punch Taverns and tenanted pub company Enterprise Inns emerged as possible bidders for some or all of the houses for sale, which include the Hogshead and Dome bar chains. Whitbread said the estate would be better off in the hands of owners \"fully concentrated\" on pubs. The company's chairman, Sir John Banham, said: \"We have a very attractive set of businesses going forward and we want to devote all our attention to that. We will not be able to do that, and do justice to our pubs and bars.\" The group will return 75% of the proceeds to investors by the middle of next year, through a special dividend or a share buyback. The rump of the business, dubbed \"Future Whitbread\", will include Pizza Hut, Cafe Rouge and Beefeater restaurants, the Marriott and Travel Inn hotel chains and David Lloyd Leisure sports clubs. The company has already sold its breweries and its share in the off-licence business First Quench this year. Chief executive David Thomas, who has been criticised in the past for lacking a clear strategy, wants to specialise on a small number of nationwide leisure brands. Whitbread's shares jumped 37.5p to 468.25p as the City welcomed the restructuring. Analyst Charles Winston of Schroder Salomon Smith Barney said: \"It's a brave move from a company which has not made enough brave moves in the past, and I applaud that.\" By last night, the number of expressions of interest in Whitbread's pubs had reached double figures. However, there were concerns that the price for the estate may not reach initial estimates of \u00a31.5bn, because of a glut of pubs on the market. Rival leisure group Bass is looking for buyers for hundreds of its neighbourhood houses, and troubled regional players such as Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley Breweries are considered to be willing sellers. Britain's two biggest pub owners, Punch Taverns and Nomura, which both have more than 5,000 outlets, are both interested. Punch's chairman, Hugh Osmond, said: \"I'm sure we'll have a look at them. When the last of the big guys gets out, I think it's a signal that the market's turning upwards.\" Punch beat Whitbread in an acrimonious battle to buy Allied Domecq's 3,500 pubs last year. The defeat led to a turning point in the leisure group's strategy. Ted Tuppen, chief executive of Enterprise Inns, said he had \"plenty of cash available\" and would examine Whitbread's 1,710 leased and tenanted pubs. There were also said to be many possible financial buyers. However, news of the sale was greeted with dismay by purists. The Campaign for Real Ale pointed out that under the ownership of a former brewer, Whitbread's tenanted pubs were entitled to stock a local \"guest beer\". Under new ownership, landlords could face \"strong-arm tactics\" to sign new leases, obliging them to stick to drinks from just a handful of big suppliers. The campaign's research manager, Iain Loe, said: \"They are betraying people who've worked hardest for them, just to follow some get-rich quick tactic of buying hotels.\"",

      "bodyText": "Engineering group GKN yesterday launched a radical restructuring of its under-performing aerospace division, including plant closures in the UK and US, designed to boost earnings. GKN confirmed that it is to close its Avonmouth plant near Bristol, with the loss of 300 jobs, and two American plants, in Carson, California, and Wallingford, Connecticut, with the loss of a further 300 posts. Avonmouth employees, who were told of the closure plans in April, will be offered jobs at GKN's factory in Cowes, Isle of Wight. The group is also selling on a German business, Sitec, reducing its aerospace manufacturing plants from 11 to seven. It is also paying $61m (\u00a344m) for Boeing's military aerospace and missiles manufacturing plant at St Louis, Missouri in an effort to widen its access to the burgeoning US defence budget. This employs 1,500 but Boeing is axeing 300 jobs before GKN takes over in January 2001. The aim is to become one of Boeing's core suppliers, particularly for work on the F18 Hornet fighter and C17 military transporter, with the prospect of lucrative contracts for the new joint strike fighter being developed for the US airforce, navy and marines. Boeing and Lockheed Martin are in a bidding war to win the world's most expensive military contract, worth anything up to $200bn with export sales, but the incoming US President is likely to award a workshare between the two. GKN officials said the St Louis business would be located close to planned new Boeing facilities in Missouri and the aim was to capture contracts from other manufacturers under a new American management team. The restructuring will cost \u00a368m and create a new GKN division under Kevin Smith, a former BAE executive, which will be separate from the helicopters business, Westland, being transferred into a joint venture with Italy's Agusta. GKN's aerospace operations, which have doubled in size over the past four years through a series of small acquisitions, are seen by industry sources as a \"muddle\" which has produced growth in sales but lower profits than expected. Yesterday's acquisition, which should generate $1.8bn extra sales over five years, will boost the new division's turnover from $500m to $800m a year. Initial profit margins should be 6% but GKN is expecting double-digit margins thereafter.

Arcadia is also scrapping its dividend. </p> <p>The company, which is the UK's second biggest clothing retailer after Marks &amp; Spencer, has been battered by the success of discounters like Matalan. It now has a stock market valuation of just \u00a370m - less than a tenth of its value two years ago when it demerged from the Burton Group. </p> <p>Arcadia, which could have collapsed earlier this year if it had not managed to renegotiate its banking facilities, is now implementing a radical recovery plan. Yesterday, as the group unveiled its dismal results, the company said it had studied its operations in all of the 527 towns in which it has outlets and that 332 need changes. So far action has only been taken in 115 and the company said there are signs that the worst is over. But finance director Nigel Hall warned: \"It's too soon to draw conclusions. I am promising nothing, but we are doing everything possible to restore our profitability.\" </p> <p>The recovery plan, called BrandMax, is hinged on making better use of the group's shopfloor space.

It hopes to be rid of the rest by February 2002. The 55 new closures will generate additional annual cost savings of \u00a320m, said Arcadia. </p> <p>But while the group's attention has been on rationalising its store portfolio, other serious problems have emerged. In 1998 the company started a mail order catalogue operation with Littlewoods, called Dial. Yesterday the company said orders have ben streaming in \"with gross orders up 23%\", and the number of shoppers up 13.5%.

It made a loss of \u00a311.3m, of which \u00a37.3m is Arcadia's share. Mr Hall described the Dial situation as \"a problem we would rather not have\" and said the blame was part Arcadia's and part Littlewoods'. \"We are working together to solve the problems,\" he said but warned it could take two years to get back to break-even. </p> <p>The group also lost \u00a33m on its Zoom internet operation, and said that was unlikely to break even for three years. </p> <p>The group's \u00a38.5m loss, which excludes a one-off \u00a3144m restructuring charge, compares to a profit of \u00a341.8m last year. But it was in line with City expectations and there were some indications that performance is improving. Like-for-like sales were ahead 4.8% in the first seven weeks of the new financial year and margins are recovering after a 0.8% dip last year. </p> <p>\"If they can sustain any amount of this current trading it will be good news,\" said one analyst, but he warned investors to take care because Arcadia had had \" a wave of false dawns\".

Jorma Ollila, Nokia's chairman and chief executive, said: \"By adding elements of mobility to the internet we see a great possibility to further enrich people's daily lives and the efficiency of companies.\" He said the group was heading towards record earnings per share in the fourth quarter and it expected sales to grow by up to 35% next year. Net profits for the first three quarters of the year were up 58% at \u20ac2.7bn (\u00a31.6bn). Technology and telecom stocks around the world were lifted by Nokia's results. Mr Ollila said Nokia had gained market share in new infrastructure technologies and in handsets. \"Our view of the market development fundamentals remains unchanged, with more than 400m mobile phones estimated to be sold in 2000, leading to an estimated one billion users in total during 2002. \"For 2001 we expect the mobile phone market to be in the region of 550m units.\" During the third quarter Nokia had continued to invest in the development of mobile internet applications which he described as \"a central element in operators' revenue generation in future mobile networks\". The growth of Nokia's business is reflected in the increase in its workforce from 53,713 to 60,048 over the past year. Its largest markets are the United States, Britain, China and Germany.",

It is a dispute that threatens to reach the highest levels of the German cultural and political establishment. In a open letter to the Berlin section of the newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, a former city councillor responsible for the arts, Ulrich Roloff-Momin, depicted the Argentina-born musician, who is due to leave the German capital in 2002, as a victim of ill-disguised anti-Jewish feeling. His claims came at a uniquely sensitive moment: a rash of attacks on synagogues earlier this month, during the holiest week in the Jewish year, left Jewish leaders in Germany questioning whether their community had any future. The Berlin city council is also preparing to publish proposals that will seal the fate of the Staatsoper, where Mr Barenboim is chief musical director. It is widely expected that the financially hard-pressed council will merge the Staatsoper with the Deutsche Oper under Christian Thielemann. Heaping fuel on to the glowing coals, Mr Roloff-Momin said that it was \"intolerable\" that German politicians should \"constantly refer to 'the Jew, Daniel Barenboim' and not the world-class artist\". He asked: \"Is it not, in fact, latent anti-Semitism when religion is made to count in cultural-political affairs?\" In an apparent allusion to the composer's decision not to renew his contract, Mr Roloff-Momin's article was published under the title \"Stay and Fight\".

      "body": "<p>The German chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, has called for a decisive shift in the ideological orientation of his Social Democratic party (SPD) that would commit Europe's most powerful leftwing movement to Blairite moderation.</p> <p>In a private speech to colleagues, only made public last night, the chancellor urged them to accept that \"the state ought not to do what society can do better\".</p> <p>Although the SPD should not abandon policies intended to help society's weaker members, Mr Schr\u00f6der made it clear that the state should \"not force people into a straitjacket that chokes freedom and individual creativity\".</p> <p>Mr Schr\u00f6der was addressing the Social Democrats' top strategic planners at the start of a detailed rethink of the party's fundamental values which officials said would continue for several years.</p> <p>His remarks seemed to sweep away lingering doubts over his true commitment to \"third way\" politics.</p> <p>After the fiery leftwinger, Oskar Lafontaine, stormed out of his government in early 1999, Mr Schr\u00f6der's position on the right of the party appeared to be beyond question. Not long after, he infuriated SPD radicals by signing a joint declaration with Tony Blair which many regarded as a betrayal of their party's most cherished values.</p> <p>Following a string of defeats in regional elections, and under mounting pressure from the left, however, Mr Schr\u00f6der surprised admirers and critics alike with a blatant exercise in state intervention.</p> <p>Late last year, he bailed out his country's second-largest construction firm, Philipp Holzmann, and in similar, traditionally leftwing, vein deplored hostile takeover bids like that by the British company Vodafone for Mannesmann of Germany.</p> <p>In his speech on Wednesday, the tactician in Mr Schr\u00f6der surfaced when he appeared to argue for periodic intervention. He told his party's strategists that it did not have to mean wholesale regulation of the free market.</p> <p>But, while making frequent nods in the direction of social concern, the rest of his address was firmly rooted in what his own advisers dubbed the \"new centre\". Mr Schr\u00f6der told his party colleagues to bear in mind that the SPD was not only Germany's oldest party and one with venerable traditions, but that it stood for renewal.</p> <p>\"Renewal has always been part of our tradition. It is not by chance that we have been closely involved in the discussion among European and non-European centre-left parties on modern governance in the 21st century,\" he added in a reference to the meetings between third way leaders.</p> <p>These debates, the most recent of which took place in Berlin earlier this year, had identified the central task facing the SPD, Mr Schr\u00f6der said.</p> <p>It was to \"find a place for social democratic and government policy in the triangle represented by the market, civil society and the state\".</p> <p>In defining the relationship between the last two, the chancellor continued, the German left should apply a principle employed by the European Union. In EU terms, so-called subsidiarity means entrusting to Brussels only those decisions which cannot be taken at a lower level, by national, regional or local governments.</p> <p>The task facing those drafting a new set of principles for the SPD was \"to define the relationship between state and society in such a way as to optimise subsidiarity\", he said.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The German chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, has called for a decisive shift in the ideological orientation of his Social Democratic party (SPD) that would commit Europe's most powerful leftwing movement to Blairite moderation. In a private speech to colleagues, only made public last night, the chancellor urged them to accept that \"the state ought not to do what society can do better\". Although the SPD should not abandon policies intended to help society's weaker members, Mr Schr\u00f6der made it clear that the state should \"not force people into a straitjacket that chokes freedom and individual creativity\". Mr Schr\u00f6der was addressing the Social Democrats' top strategic planners at the start of a detailed rethink of the party's fundamental values which officials said would continue for several years. His remarks seemed to sweep away lingering doubts over his true commitment to \"third way\" politics. After the fiery leftwinger, Oskar Lafontaine, stormed out of his government in early 1999, Mr Schr\u00f6der's position on the right of the party appeared to be beyond question. Not long after, he infuriated SPD radicals by signing a joint declaration with Tony Blair which many regarded as a betrayal of their party's most cherished values. Following a string of defeats in regional elections, and under mounting pressure from the left, however, Mr Schr\u00f6der surprised admirers and critics alike with a blatant exercise in state intervention. Late last year, he bailed out his country's second-largest construction firm, Philipp Holzmann, and in similar, traditionally leftwing, vein deplored hostile takeover bids like that by the British company Vodafone for Mannesmann of Germany. In his speech on Wednesday, the tactician in Mr Schr\u00f6der surfaced when he appeared to argue for periodic intervention. He told his party's strategists that it did not have to mean wholesale regulation of the free market. But, while making frequent nods in the direction of social concern, the rest of his address was firmly rooted in what his own advisers dubbed the \"new centre\". Mr Schr\u00f6der told his party colleagues to bear in mind that the SPD was not only Germany's oldest party and one with venerable traditions, but that it stood for renewal. \"Renewal has always been part of our tradition. It is not by chance that we have been closely involved in the discussion among European and non-European centre-left parties on modern governance in the 21st century,\" he added in a reference to the meetings between third way leaders. These debates, the most recent of which took place in Berlin earlier this year, had identified the central task facing the SPD, Mr Schr\u00f6der said. It was to \"find a place for social democratic and government policy in the triangle represented by the market, civil society and the state\". In defining the relationship between the last two, the chancellor continued, the German left should apply a principle employed by the European Union. In EU terms, so-called subsidiarity means entrusting to Brussels only those decisions which cannot be taken at a lower level, by national, regional or local governments. The task facing those drafting a new set of principles for the SPD was \"to define the relationship between state and society in such a way as to optimise subsidiarity\", he said.",

      "bodyText": "South Africa's president, Thabo Mbeki, has suffered a large and sudden fall in public support almost certainly attributable to his controversial stance on the cause of Aids. Mr Mbeki's approval rating has dropped to a fraction above 50% from more than 70% in May, according to an opinion poll released today by the most credible of South Africa's polling organisations, the Institute for Democracy (Idasa). The results are a significant blow to Mr Mbeki's leadership because support for the ruling African National Congress as a whole has stood up with 69% of black voters saying they will back the party in December's important elections in the vast new megacities created around Johannesburg, Pretoria and Cape Town. When compared to his predecessor's standing, Mr Mbeki's position is even more stark. Nelson Mandela had an 85% approval rating just before he left office last year. \"There is no doubt that this is a wake-up call for Mbeki and his government,\" said Richard Calland, the head of political programmes at Idasa. \"The survey as a whole shows a decline in people's confidence in representative institutions. It is as if people feel they are not being listened to enough.\" As recently as July, two-thirds of South Africans approved of their president's performance. The decline in support has coincided with the public airing of Mr Mbeki's controversial questioning of the link between HIV and Aids, and his association with a minority of scientists who say there is no connection between the virus and the disease. The government has refused to supply anti-Aids drugs to public hospitals after initially saying they were unproven and toxic but then, after a barrage of criticism, saying it could not afford them. About 62% of South Africans do not have confidence in the government's attempts to prevent the spread of Aids - an issue that will be the single most important of Mr Mbeki's presidency and likely to devastate the population. One in 10 South Africans is HIV-positive and the country has among the highest infection rates in the world. In an attempt to recover public support, Mr Mbeki last week withdrew from the public debate over Aids and handed responsibility for justifying the government's policies on the disease to a committee led by his equally controversial health minister. The poll's findings are likely to provide ammunition to those within the ANC unhappy with Mr Mbeki. The party is divided over a number of issues, particularly the Aids controversy. But there are also broad philosophical differences over the role of government in South Africa.

Criticised periodically for preying on women's insecurities - the big-name companies, Est\u00e9e Lauder, Revlon, Olay, have targeted the seven signs of ageing: fine lines and wrinkles; poor skin texture; poor skin tone; lack of radiance; enlarged pores; blotches and age spots; and dryness. They claim you can reverse the ageing process with specialised ingredients that come suspended in (invariably expensive) lotions and potions. Currently, the most effective of these are said to be vitamin A derivatives, vitamin C and AHAs (alpha-hydroxy acids), which are said to speed up the natural process of desquamation (the shedding of dead skin cells) - by loosening the cement that holds the cells together.

It all started back in the early 80s with fabulous line-free women holding a tub up to their faces in a \"loving\" way.

(\"Hey, know what? You could get out of this stuffy old research lark and earn a fortune as an actress/model?\")</p> <p>Cut to shower scene - you know how it went. The message was: \"We are gorgeous, young and very bright and if that's not enough to convince you to buy this pot of gloop then here comes the science bit.\" But no one really believes that those girls really work in a lab, do they? And shouldn't that fact alone impact on the credibility of the product and therefore our desire to buy it?</p> <p>Well, um, evidently not. Revlon's latest anti-ageing product is \"age defying all day lifting foundation\" which \"lifts fine lines up, up and away\" \"an incredible 30% reduction in just 2 weeks!*\" and contains \"soy extracts and vitamins A, C, and E\". The asterisk, it says in very small print, means \"based on clinical testing\". Similar claims are made on the labels of countless other products, but what does this really mean, if anything? Dr Nick Lowe, consultant dermatologist at the Cranley Clinic in central London is sceptical. \"The problem with over-the-counter cosmetics is that they very often exaggerate their effectiveness and the claims are not supported by careful scientific scrutiny. Sometimes the research is not made available, sometimes I suspect that the research has never been done.\"</p> <p>He is more optimistic about prescription strength formulas currently being developed in America. \"There are some creams that make claims for age reversal which do work. These include some which contain retin A or retinova, a substance derived from vitamin A. In controlled studies in California, at prescription strength these creams are able to convincingly improve fine lines, skin quality, brown pigmentation and skin firmness. But they are only available on private prescription.\"</p> <p>So does he think all over-the-counter products are ineffective?</p> <p>\"No, not all products are, but most. At a meeting of the European academy of dermatology last week a new ingredient, retinaldihide, which is another derivative of vitamin A mixed with vitamin C, was approved. Products by French companies such as La Roche Posay and Vichy are often recommended by dermatologists because they have conducted proper research. But most often you are paying \u00a3200-\u00a3300 for a pot of cream that has very low quantities of active ingredients. Sometimes it is bulked up with expensive extracts - such as caviar - but no one has tested caviar so no one knows if it's going to be beneficial in any way - unless, of course, you eat it.\"</p> <p>The modern approach to selling pots of anti-ageing cream is more emotional than scientific. Olay's latest day-and-night cream, \"total effects\" employs first-person testimonies to sell it. \"I cannot believe how minuscule the lines on my forehead and around my eyes look.\" \"I look younger - several years younger. Never before has an over-the-counter topical cream made such a difference in my skin texture, tone, colour and appearance.\" \"I can't believe the difference it has made on my laugh lines.\"</p> <p>Doesn't it make your teeth itch? Eve Lom, whose facials and skincare products at Space NK have won her the loyalty of the celeb set, wouldn't give these women the time of day. \"Women need wrinkles. And even if you could get rid of them, how do you hide the crippled posture, the sagging neck, the worn hands? Anti-ageing products are a waste of time. I just think, 'don't you have anything better to do - because I do'.\"</p> <p>Dr Peter Coburn, a consultant dermatologist in West Sussex, believes that these sort of testimonials are based purely on a temporary improvement.</p> <p>\"Some products will smooth out the skin and temporarily make it look smoother but can't reverse the ageing process. Most of these anti-ageing creams contain an ingredient which produces an irritant reaction. This then causes local swelling which effectively irons out the wrinkles - for a short while.\"</p> <p>Which sounds like a pretty clever idea, doesn't it?</p> <p>\"No, not really,\" says Coburn. \"If you rubbed sand into your face it would probably have the same effect.</p> <p>\"Retinoids,\" he continues, \"are extremely successful at treating skin disorders but they don't have any proven anti-ageing effects. The only way to get rid of wrinkles is through laser treatment, facial peeling or surgery - cut it out and stretch what's left.\"</p> <p>All of which leaves you feeling confused, at least. Not only do we have to put up with society's obsession with youth and beauty.

      "body": "<p>When the young Walter Lippmann, later to become the foremost advocate of American engagement in the world, travelled to Europe in June 1914, he had not even the faintest notion that a terrible war was imminent. \"It was possible,\" he wrote, \"for an American in those days to be totally unconscious of the world he lived in.\" He dallied in the Lake District for a while, then crossed to Belgium, planning to go on through Germany to Switzerland for a walking holiday.

      "bodyText": "When the young Walter Lippmann, later to become the foremost advocate of American engagement in the world, travelled to Europe in June 1914, he had not even the faintest notion that a terrible war was imminent. \"It was possible,\" he wrote, \"for an American in those days to be totally unconscious of the world he lived in.\" He dallied in the Lake District for a while, then crossed to Belgium, planning to go on through Germany to Switzerland for a walking holiday. He remembered \"being rather annoyed when I went into the railway station and found that the German border was closed because Belgium had had an ultimatum.\" Lippmann recorded this anecdote in a book he wrote in 1943 arguing that the United States could no longer operate as if it was a country separate and aloof from all others, that it had a stake in world order, and that it had to respect what order existed.

Instead, he struggled, right up to his death at the age of 64, for justice and dignity for his people, the Aborigines, and to alert the white majority to the truth that unless they gave back nationhood to the first Australians, they could never claim their own.</p> <p>Charlie became my friend on a blistering hot day in 1969, when he took me home to Alice Springs. Having grown up in Sydney, I was introduced to an Australia I barely knew existed. We picked up Hetti, his mother, who was waiting at the roadside, beneath a magnificent black hat. A queen of the Arrente people, she had given birth to Charlie on a tabletop in the disused Alice Springs telegraph office in 1936 or 1937; she was never sure which.</p> <p>We drove out into the red desert, heading for the federal government reserve at Jay Creek, where 300 aboriginal people were corralled in administered squalor, often without water - in 40-degree temperatures - and proper food or housing. The children had distended bellies and trachoma, which leads to blindness. This was the Australian gulag.</p> <p>The barbed wire gate was locked, and declared: \"No entry, by ministerial order\". \"What d'you, reckon, mum?\" said Charlie. \"Do it,\" said Hetti, from the back seat. I reversed the car, revved it and smashed through the gate.</p> <p>\"G'day,\" said Charlie to the white manager, whose ablutions we had interrupted. \"Where's your bloody permit?\" \"Lost it, mate,\" said Charlie. \"Now, how come these children look so bloody sick...?\"</p> <p>It was Charlie who did much to change the conditions at Jay Creek, and begin to right Australia's great wrong by bringing the most basic human rights to aboriginal people. On behalf of the most discarded minority of any white colonial country, his trailblazing role was momentous, as was his courage.</p> <p>Growing up as a mixed-race Aborigine, he was \"protected\" so that he might be \"assimilated\" - the bureaucratic language that masked the suffering of the \"stolen generation\", now recognised as a form of genocide, in which children were taken from their mothers and sent to institutions and as bonded labour. He remembered his grandmother as only a face behind barbed wire. One of his brothers killed himself, which was common among young Aborigines - and still is. Charlie himself was never stolen, because Hetti never took her eyes off him.</p> <p>\"You learned from when you were a kid to stay out of the way of whites,\" he told me. \"Our big treat was being taken to the pictures, sneaking in after the movie had started, and leaving before it ended, so that no one would object to us black kids being there. I grew up never knowing if the goodies or baddies won. Very frustrating.\"</p> <p>Charlie was sent to mission school in Adelaide, where he discovered soccer, and, at 16, was spotted by the English first-division club, Everton, which offered to pay his fare to England in the late 1950s. Later, he was invited by Matt Busby for a trial with Manchester United - and holds the distinction of turning the great man down. \"You know, I found a kind of racial dignity in England,\" he told me. \"But I was homesick.\"</p> <p>Arriving back in Adelaide in 1959, he became only the second Aborigine to graduate from an Australian university. In the mid-1960s, he led white students on freedom rides into the outback of New South Wales, with much the same objective as the freedom riders who began desegregation in the American south. Charlie and his white comrades stood at the turnstile of public swimming pools, and demanded that black children be allowed entry.</p> <p>In the town of Moree, they were spat at and assaulted, and menaced by a crowd. \"I thought we'd had it,\" he said. \"Then this black woman stepped forward and made a courageous speech, in which she pointed to a white man who had gone secretly with black women and fathered black children. 'Tell your wives what you've been doing, you bludgers,' she said. 'Go on, they're just over there. Tell 'em!' That evening, black kids were allowed into the pool for the first time. We had won the first battle.\"</p> <p>Charlie went on to win - and lose - many battles. He was manager of the Foundation for Aboriginal Affairs, which helped run the campaign that produced a resounding \"yes\" in a 1967 referendum, giving the federal government power to legislate justice for Aboriginals - a power so often neglected and misused.</p> <p>He served in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs in Canberra, rising to permanent secretary, but co-option never really worked for him. He invariably spoke his mind, calling racist politcians racist; in a society renowned for its outspokeness, but in reality often embarrassed by it, he gathered enemies.</p> <p>Whenever he came to London, he would call me and say, \"Get the media out, mate. There's a demo outside Australia House that will tell the Poms about an Australia that's just like South Africa.\" Knowing his reply, I would ask how many were going: \"Just me\". Even when Sydney University gave him an honorary doctorate recently, he used the occasion to attack John Howard's government for effectively taking away the common law rights that the high court had said belonged to Aborigines - an action the United Nations has condemned as racist. He would have exploded had he heard Howard this week paying tribute to him through clenched teeth.</p> <p>Like so many Aborigines, Charlie was burdened by ill-health, although he regarded the gift of a kidney, 28 years ago, as a miracle. Most Aborigines can expect to die in their 40s and 50s. \"I beat that,\" he said, when I last saw him. He drew lifelong strength from his remarkable wife Eileen, his children Hettie, Rachel and Adam, and his grandchildren.</p> <p>I spoke to him in hospital the day after the Sydney Olympics ended, and he was cursing, typically, the muting of a \"shaming campaign\" in which he had hoped to participate.

President Olusegun Obasanjo proscribed the widely supported Odua People's Congress (OPC) and ordered the arrest of its leadership and members amid another surge in the ethnic violence that many Nigerians fear is a further step toward the Balkanisation of their country. Nigeria's senate empowered Mr Obasanjo to declare a state of emergency in Lagos, in the south-west of Nigeria. Thousands of Hausa families originally from northern Nigeria have sought protection in military barracks as soldiers have been deployed in the centre and suburbs of Lagos to stop the killings by Yoruba militants. Bodies were still lying in the street yesterday amid torched cars and buses and razed buildings. \"Such brutal and irresponsible acts cannot and must not be tolerated in a civilized society,\" Mr Obasanjo said. \"Therefore, law enforcement agencies are hereby ordered to arrest and prosecute any person who claims or presents himself as a member of the OPC and similar organisations, all of which are hereby declared illegal, unacceptable and a serious threat to the peace and security of Nigeria.\" The police say they have picked up more than 200 people, including two OPC leaders. \"We are going for the OPC leaders one by one.

The Red Cross said at least 100 people have been killed - although this figure is probably an underestimate - and 20,000 have been forced from their homes by the violence which began on Sunday as Yoruba militants pursued alleged thieves into a mainly Hausa area of Lagos. The attacks spread to many other parts of the city, including parts of the business district. Until now, Mr Obasanjo has trodden carefully around the OPC but the latest bloodletting is expected to lead to retaliatory attacks against Yorubas living in northern cities. It has also raised the spectre of the first attempt at secession by a Nigerian region since Biafra's failed bid for in dependence three decades ago in which more than a million died. The OPC was founded six years ago to promote the interests of 20m Yorubas living in Nigeria's south-west, where there is widespread resentment at years of military rule under the northern-dominated army. Popular support for the organisation surged after it emerged from the underground with the return of civilian government last year - just as northern states rushed to introduce hardline Islamic law, including amputations for theft and lashes for adultery. The imposition of Sharia law is widely viewed as a form of ethnic persecution by the mostly Christian southerners living in northern Nigeria. It has increased public backing in Lagos for the OPC's demand for political autonomy or even outright independence for south-western Nigeria.

The police have spent nearly a year hunting the leader of the organisation's more radical faction, a cabinet maker called Gani Adams, who has become a folk hero in Lagos. He has eluded capture despite a price put on his head by the authorities and radical northern organisations for leading the ethnic killings of thousands of Hausas and eastern Igbos in Lagos. The murders provoked retaliatory massacres in other parts of Nigeria. Underpinning the rise in Yoruba nationalism are fears that growing disillusionment with Mr Obasanjo's government could lead to a return of military rule. His failure to revive Nigeria's economy and his bitter battles with the country's corruption-plagued parliament have been compounded by accusations of ethnic favouritism on all sides. Mr Obasanjo, a Yoruba, has lost support in south where he is charged with being soft on the militant Muslims behind the constitutionally questionable enforcement of Sharia law. In the north, he is accused of ignoring OPC excesses. The information minister, Jerry Gana, rejected the latter charge by reminding Nigerians of the near-total destruction of the south-eastern town of Odi by the army when it was ordered to quell unrest there.",

But although money has been spent on lavish scientific laboratories at the site, water still seeps into the foundations of the 4,000-year-old city and salt deposits are weakening the structures. Six of the most important sites in Pakistan are listed by Unesco, requiring Islamabad to protect and preserve the monuments in return for financial help. At their annual meeting later this year exasperated Unesco officials are likely to embarrass Pakistan's military regime by placing two of the worst affected sites on a blacklist of endangered world heritage treasures. If restoration work does not improve, the monuments will then be dropped altogether as listed sites. \"The government recognises cultural heritage is important ...

Unesco managed to halt the work earlier this year but the stadium gate, walls and pavilion remain, surrounding excavated ruins. The rest of Taxila appears largely unmanaged. Unesco is also deeply concerned about the Shish Mahal and the Moenjodaro ruins. Work is finally due to begin on the Shish Mahal, two years after the temporary scaffolding was set up. But the \u00a325,000 project will only be an inspection, not a restoration. At Moenjodaro, managers have been accused of misusing their positions to appoint relatives rather than technical experts to maintain the ruins. Since the fundraising campaign ended three years ago many have complained that preservation work stopped. Often competition between national and provincial bureaucrats is blamed for holding back preservation efforts. Saeed-ul Rehman, who has led the government archaeology department for the past two years, said he was aware of Unesco's concerns and was trying to rectify the problems. \"It is a question of not having enough money or experts,\" he said. \"Conservation is a time-consuming job.

      "bodyText": "Britain is one of the least family friendly countries in Europe, according to a report published today by the National Family and Parenting Institute. In spite of increasingly flexible working arrangements, most parents are left struggling with long hours, poor childcare facilities and inadequate state benefits, the survey shows. Britain has the second highest fatality rate in Europe for child pedestrians, leaving parents worrying that their neighbourhoods are too risky to let their children out to play. Family travel on public transport is more expensive and less easy to manage for parents struggling single-handedly with a buggy. Pubs and restaurants are less welcoming and parents feel blamed when their children are difficult in supermarkets. \"We are in a mess about the family,\" the report says. \"Everyone and every organisation has something to say - sometimes contradictory and often with great certainty.\" The survey was based on an analysis of EU statistics and focus groups probing the experiences of a cross section of 200 British parents. Next week has been declared parents' week and charities intend to use the opportunity to put pressure on Stephen Byers, the trade and industry secretary, who is leading a government review of support for working parents. The report says many parents feel that the British are not tolerant of children and that being a parent is often more demanding than paid employment. According to the report, entitled \"Is Britain Family Friendly?\", the UK compares badly to other European countries on a range of measures, including balancing work and family life, childcare, family travel, and road accidents. The institute is calling on retailers, bus and rail companies, restaurants, pubs and public services to audit the service they offer to families and children. Mary MacLeod, its chief executive, said: \"Despite some good new government policies designed to support families, parents in Britain still feel left to go it alone, expected to manage raising children and working, with little allowance made for their vital family responsibilities.\" The problem starts immediately for parents of newly born children. \"Unlike other European countries, women in the UK are not able to take much time off after the birth of the child without financial hardship,\" the report says. Maternity pay is less than half the EU average - worth eight weeks on full salary compared with 14 weeks or more in Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, Italy and Denmark. Mothers in the focus groups said there was pressure on them to return to work as soon as possible. \"You need two wages to pay a mortgage, so when you stop working to have children, you can't afford it,\" said one. Another said: \"I think they try and make it as hard as possible for parents to stay at home. There's no financial help there.\" A third said: \"The government is encouraging people to have a family and then dump the kids on someone else and go back to work.\" Britain offered \"one of the worst deals in Europe\" on parental leave for mothers and fathers with young children. The government excluded parents of children born before December 1999 and provided for 12 weeks of unpaid leave to be shared between both parents until the child is five. The survey found that British fathers work the longest hours in Europe and working mothers are more reliant on informal arrangements for childcare: \"The summer holiday was for many a time of worry about cover and increased costs.\" Parents worry that their neighbourhood is too risky to let the children out to play and too polluted and dangerous to enjoy as an amenity. The proportion of 10-year-olds walking to school fell from more than 90% in 1971 to just over half in 1990. The report said parents in the focus groups spoke eloquently about children not being welcome in public places. Their experience of relentless public criticism of private decisions on how to live family life left them feeling beleaguered. There were confused messages from the government. One parent said: \"They say they want to bring back the family unit and they want families to be at home together. Then they encourage mothers to go back to work.

He might have added that bureaucracy as a mode of domination has often been justified as the necessary price of democracy, insofar as it ensures transparency of decision-making and equity in outcomes. Experience at my own university and elsewhere suggests that what we are witnessing is not only secrecy among decision-makers but also disregard for students.</p> <p>The question must be asked: transparency for whom and to what end?

Academics are free to peddle sub-standard tuition with impunity, since the visitor system blocks recourse to the courts for students who suffer as a result. The public, moreover, has no right of access to information about the standards of a university faculty. Until universities become as accountable as other service industries, the \"institutionalised contempt\" complained of remains fully deserved.<br> <b>Chris Bell</b><br> London <a href=\"mailto:cpbell@hotmail.com\">cpbell@hotmail.com</a></p>",

Prof Yiannis Gabriel Imperial College, London y.gabriel@ic.ac.uk \u0095 Richard Sennett correctly states that the research transparency exercise imposed upon university teachers represents another stage in the bureaucratisation of higher education, whose underlying premise is \"an institutionalised form of contempt\". He might have added that bureaucracy as a mode of domination has often been justified as the necessary price of democracy, insofar as it ensures transparency of decision-making and equity in outcomes. Experience at my own university and elsewhere suggests that what we are witnessing is not only secrecy among decision-makers but also disregard for students. The question must be asked: transparency for whom and to what end? Until we receive serious answers, I advise all university staff and students to support the National Union of Students' day of action on November 15 as part of a campaign to expose the malaise which is now afflicting one of the key institutional sectors of our country. Dr Alan Hooper University of Hertfordshire a.hooper@herts.ac.uk \u0095 No doubt Richard Sennett and his colleagues would find life a lot easier if left to their own devices, but his assertion that they would \"hold each other to account\" rings hollow. Academics are free to peddle sub-standard tuition with impunity, since the visitor system blocks recourse to the courts for students who suffer as a result. The public, moreover, has no right of access to information about the standards of a university faculty. Until universities become as accountable as other service industries, the \"institutionalised contempt\" complained of remains fully deserved. Chris Bell London cpbell@hotmail.com",

The controversy over the sackings, known as Travelgate, was one of the issues investigated by Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel famous for his role in the Monica Lewinsky affair. Mr Starr's successor, Robert Ray, closed the investigation in June, saying there was insufficient evidence to support charges. However, in the full text of the report published late on Wednesday, Mr Ray concluded that Mrs Clinton had given \"factually false\" statements in a sworn deposition about her involvement in the dismissal of seven employees in the White House travel office, and their replacement by Clinton friends and relatives. The sackings led to charges of cronyism and a multimillion-dollar investigation. Hillary Clinton's lawyer, David Kendall, rejected the findings as \"unfair, misleading and rife with innuendo\", and a White House official noted that Mr Ray's report conceded that there had been financial irregularities in the way the travel office had been run. But Mrs Clinton's Republican opponent in New York, Rick Lazio, was swift to incorporate the report into his sustained attacks on her integrity. In a 1993 memorandum, David Watkins, the official who sacked the travel staff, said there would be \"hell to pay\" if the administration \"failed to take swift and decisive action in conformity with the First Lady's wishes\". Mr Watkins later testified that Mrs Clinton told him: \"we need to have our people in there.\" Other White House aides recalled conversations with Mrs Clinton on the issue. However in her 1995 testimony, the First Lady not only denied having \"any role\" in the affair, she also said she had not had \"any input\" in the decision to fire the seven employees. In an argument echoing Mr Clinton's semantic arguments in the Lewinsky investigation, Mr Kendall wrote that in the Travelgate hearings there had been a disagreement over the significance of the word \"role\". Mr Kendall said that Mrs Clinton \"may not even have been aware of any influence she may have had on the firing decision\".",

      "bodyText": "The west's three permanent members of the UN Security Council account for 80% of the world's weapons sales at a time when it is incapable of mounting effective peacekeeping operations, according to a report published yesterday by a London-based thinktank. The report, by the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), is deeply sceptical about the EU's ability to realise its plans for an independent, 60,000-strong rapid-reaction force. \"European leaders speak of a European defence capacity but have not voted [for] the funds to finance it,\" said the IISS director, John Chipman. The US increased its share of the international arms trade last year and now accounts for nearly 50% of the $53.4bn (\u00a337bn) annual market, according to the IISS publication, the Military Balance. Britain came second, selling nearly \u00a37bn worth of weapons, while France was third at almost \u00a34.6bn. Much of these weapons systems were supplied to the Middle East, the world's biggest arms market. Saudi Arabia, the world's largest arms buyer, purchased more than \u00a34bn worth of weapons last year. Taiwan was the largest arms importer in East Asia. Middle Eastern countries spent \u00a342bn on defence last year, says the report, which also notes that the Israeli air force had set up its first anti-ballistic missile battery some 30 miles south of Tel Aviv. The IISS damned the lack of government commitment to international peacekeeping. \"It remains the case that the UN continues to overreach, approving ambitious mandates and deploying inadequately supported forces in volatile situations,\" Mr Chipman said. \"The long-term aim of the UN operation in Sierra Leone is unclear and the capacity of the UN to make a sensible contribution to what is a hugely unstable situation in the Congo is questionable,\" he said. UN member states were \"incapable of producing the sometimes very large contingents that a proper operation would require,\" he said. While defence spending increased in most regions of the world, including the US, spending by Nato's European members other than Britain and the three new entrants - Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic - continued to decline. \"Nato countries in Europe are feeling the strain of what looks like an increasingly lengthy commitment in Kosovo,\" the report said. \"Even those with all-professional forces are finding they are over-committed in Europe and beyond.\" \"It remains doubtful whether the Europeans can realise their ambitions for a credible 60,000-strong independent force,\" it adds. If the continent is unable to muster a credible independent force, Nato will have to remain strongly involved in EU security. \"European defence, in all but the most trivial of cases, will remain a transatlantic affair,\" Mr Chipman said. Britain and France have invested considerable political and diplomatic capital in setting up a joint EU military force, which would conduct peacekeeping operations without US or Nato involvement France wants to cap its six-month stint as EU president at the European summit in Nice in December with a firm commitment to set up a credible force with at least 60,000 troops. \u0095 100,000 people were killed as a direct result of armed conflicts in the year up to August, 60% of them in sub-Saharan Africa, the IISS says.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Nicola Bruce's I Could Read the Sky is based on Timothy O'Grady's book of the same name. It's a work which, with photographs by Steve Pyke, superbly evoked the mental state - anguish, fond memory, despair, disgust and the sweaty terrors of digs and pub life - of the Irish exile living off the building sites and decaying towards a lonely death. Stranded in his digs in Camden Town, J Brady (with Michael Collins, one of the many pseudonyms the men on \"the buildings\" use to keep a distance from authority) mutters to himself of past and wretched present. </p> <p>The fragmented world he evokes, baleful or radiant, slips in and out of focus, offering as much torment as consolation. The filming itself is as wilful: continual superimposition and soft focus; allusive, impressionistic and occasionally surreal. When Brady (played by Dermot Healy) encounters an old friend from home (Stephen Rea), the camera becomes as drunken as the protagonists. </p> <p>Only gradually does a storyline emerge: a simple one of a lost homeland, slavish work, a crippling accident, love found in a pub and quenched one day when, walking towards him - \"Her hand stalls in the air as if she's forgotten something\" - she collapses and dies. Like everything else in Brady's life, it is too fragmentary an episode to linger over sentimentally for too long. </p> <p>The camera declares that the texture of exile - of mud, of brick, of old faces, of accordions (the only reliable source of joy) and of spoons and pigs (\"with eyes like a priest, calm and sure\") - is as important as the shifting reality of the people. But exile, particularly that spooky kind of exile whereby the Irish squat in a country which perversely refuses to acknowledge their foreignness because of the apparently common language, is not what it used to be. Global homogenisation has smoothed out the wrinkles of individuality and islands - which not so long ago were joined only by the unstabilised, vomit mailboat from Dun Laoire - are permanently logged on to each other. </p> <p>Instead of the battered leather suitcase, the Irish now bring their briefcases, mobile phones and PCs, magic boxes of instant communication with home. This, to an extent at least, reduces the sweetest anguish of exile: remembering in isolation. Brady reveals, in a list of some of the things he could do, how ill-equipped the emigrant was on arrival in London. \"I could thatch a roof. Knew the song to sing to a cow when milking. Cut turf. Work the swath turner, the float and thresher. Read the sky. Remember poems.\" </p> <p>The things he couldn't do explains why the Irish all huddled for comfort in Camden Town, Kilburn or Willesden. \"I couldn't: eat a meal lacking potatoes. Trust banks. Wear a watch. Ask a woman to go for a walk. Drive a motor car. Wear a collar in comfort. Acknowledge the Queen. Drink coffee. Follow cricket. Speak with men wearing collars... Stop remembering.\" </p> <p>That was the traditional Irish exile, forced from a barren farm to earn a living on building sites. There is an extra-ordinary lack of film record of this, one of the most persistent and highly-charged of population movements: the defensive and defenceless Irish, shabbily treated by their own country, morosely putting themselves at the mercy of the traditional enemy. </p> <p>A rare example is Philip Donnellan's 50-minute The Irishmen. Shot in 1965 by the excellent cameraman Michael Williams on the building sites and in London Irish pubs and homes, it was made just at the point where the Irish were shifting upwards socially. </p> <p>The Irishmen discloses the physical horror, to them, of urban England: the aggressive resentment at being treated like a lower and - more enraging - amusing species. It underlines their baggage of religious belief and intolerance, of primitive patriotism and even muddled pride in their manual achievements over here. But mostly it shows the Irishman as a wounded beast, part nomad, part squatter. One worker describes his first impression: \"It was just daybreak when I got to Manchester. Everything was black. Even though the day was coming out, it was as if it didn't want to, as though Manchester wasn't entitled to daylight.\" </p> <p>They had come from luminous, rural Ireland with its eternally cleansing winds. \"The darkness of the place,\" said another. \"And wide open spaces. Where were all the cows? Nothing in sight, all I could see was buildings and tracks. Where were they all leading to?\" The experience was riddled with perplexing incomprehension, temperamental clashes and rigid stereotyping. </p> <p>In the 50s and 60s, the Irish were building England, as one man on the building sites put it belligerently in the film: \"Go down to Camden Town in the morning, go to the Brecknock in the morning, go to the Nag's Head just at the Seven Sisters Road, go up to the Archway, and ask me who was doing the work in this country? They were all Irishmen. Who built the road at the Nag's Head? A man from Dingle. That was the man who put it through with Irish labour.\" It was the son of such a man who, when asked at school, \"Who made the world?\" answered: \"McAlpine.\" They were known as McAlpine's Fusiliers, working in horrible conditions, famed in story and mocked in song: \"As down the glen came McAlpine's men with their shovels slung behind them/ We sweated blood and we washed down mud with quarts and pints of beer/ I remember the day that the Bear O'Shea fell into a concrete stair/ What Horeseface said, when he saw him dead, well it wasn't what the rich call prayers/...If you pride your life, don't join, by Christ, with McAlpine's Fusiliers.\" </p> <p>In the 50s, the English confronted them with the first of a series of prejudices. \"Paddy ye ran home when the war started!\" the English would say. In Donnellan's film, a man angrily rebuts this: \"There's lots of things I want the English people to understand. I've got a brother with a leg and an arm missing that fought for this country. My father fought from 1914 to 1918, two uncles killed at Dunkirk and my brother is at home now with a 10-guineas-a-week British army pension.\" They worked their way through layers of prejudice. By the 70s, it was their perceived sympathy with the IRA bombing campaigns. They kept their heads down after the Aldershot bombing - when some stores refused to stock Kerrygold butter (though Guinness was never withdrawn). The Birmingham bombing brought a deep insecurity to the settled community. But it passed and the Canary Wharf devastation resulted in no serious backlash. </p> <p>In the late 60s, the Irish shifted from a taboo against mixing in English politics (as distinct from sabotaging it) to direct involvement through the local Labour party. They already had Callaghan and Healey, never convincing representatives of Irish mentality. Now they got their own MP - and he sat (against all republican principles) in the House of Commons. Michael O'Halloran was elected MP for north Islington, a man who stood firm on Irish Catholic values (or not, as the occasion demanded). The Irish were on the way up. The roads had been built, the spaghetti junctions laid, the pubs serviced. Now they went into business on a massive scale. For a long time, they remained faithful Labour supporters. </p> <p>The Irish staged in 1965 the most dramatic public example of native culture: a hurling match at Wembley, billed The Fastest Game in the World (and the most dangerous). Later, prime minister Edward Heath was said to have expressed a willingness to attend what became an annual event. But the Irish were not yet ready for the Tories. In his book, The Irish In Britain (1972), Kevin O'Connor reported that \"such an invitation was not forthcoming from the Irish\". Bloody Sunday in Derry in January 1972 delayed the unthinkable move of the Irish to the Tories. But it became inevitable, and first to cross the line were the middle-class business community. </p> <p>As the Irish moved up the social ladder, their reputation for uncouth living and criminal tendencies - spectacular in the 50s - shifted onto blacks.

      "bodyText": "Nicola Bruce's I Could Read the Sky is based on Timothy O'Grady's book of the same name. It's a work which, with photographs by Steve Pyke, superbly evoked the mental state - anguish, fond memory, despair, disgust and the sweaty terrors of digs and pub life - of the Irish exile living off the building sites and decaying towards a lonely death. Stranded in his digs in Camden Town, J Brady (with Michael Collins, one of the many pseudonyms the men on \"the buildings\" use to keep a distance from authority) mutters to himself of past and wretched present. The fragmented world he evokes, baleful or radiant, slips in and out of focus, offering as much torment as consolation. The filming itself is as wilful: continual superimposition and soft focus; allusive, impressionistic and occasionally surreal. When Brady (played by Dermot Healy) encounters an old friend from home (Stephen Rea), the camera becomes as drunken as the protagonists. Only gradually does a storyline emerge: a simple one of a lost homeland, slavish work, a crippling accident, love found in a pub and quenched one day when, walking towards him - \"Her hand stalls in the air as if she's forgotten something\" - she collapses and dies. Like everything else in Brady's life, it is too fragmentary an episode to linger over sentimentally for too long. The camera declares that the texture of exile - of mud, of brick, of old faces, of accordions (the only reliable source of joy) and of spoons and pigs (\"with eyes like a priest, calm and sure\") - is as important as the shifting reality of the people. But exile, particularly that spooky kind of exile whereby the Irish squat in a country which perversely refuses to acknowledge their foreignness because of the apparently common language, is not what it used to be. Global homogenisation has smoothed out the wrinkles of individuality and islands - which not so long ago were joined only by the unstabilised, vomit mailboat from Dun Laoire - are permanently logged on to each other. Instead of the battered leather suitcase, the Irish now bring their briefcases, mobile phones and PCs, magic boxes of instant communication with home. This, to an extent at least, reduces the sweetest anguish of exile: remembering in isolation. Brady reveals, in a list of some of the things he could do, how ill-equipped the emigrant was on arrival in London. \"I could thatch a roof. Knew the song to sing to a cow when milking. Cut turf. Work the swath turner, the float and thresher. Read the sky. Remember poems.\" The things he couldn't do explains why the Irish all huddled for comfort in Camden Town, Kilburn or Willesden. \"I couldn't: eat a meal lacking potatoes. Trust banks. Wear a watch. Ask a woman to go for a walk. Drive a motor car. Wear a collar in comfort. Acknowledge the Queen. Drink coffee. Follow cricket. Speak with men wearing collars... Stop remembering.\" That was the traditional Irish exile, forced from a barren farm to earn a living on building sites. There is an extra-ordinary lack of film record of this, one of the most persistent and highly-charged of population movements: the defensive and defenceless Irish, shabbily treated by their own country, morosely putting themselves at the mercy of the traditional enemy. A rare example is Philip Donnellan's 50-minute The Irishmen. Shot in 1965 by the excellent cameraman Michael Williams on the building sites and in London Irish pubs and homes, it was made just at the point where the Irish were shifting upwards socially. The Irishmen discloses the physical horror, to them, of urban England: the aggressive resentment at being treated like a lower and - more enraging - amusing species. It underlines their baggage of religious belief and intolerance, of primitive patriotism and even muddled pride in their manual achievements over here. But mostly it shows the Irishman as a wounded beast, part nomad, part squatter. One worker describes his first impression: \"It was just daybreak when I got to Manchester. Everything was black. Even though the day was coming out, it was as if it didn't want to, as though Manchester wasn't entitled to daylight.\" They had come from luminous, rural Ireland with its eternally cleansing winds. \"The darkness of the place,\" said another. \"And wide open spaces. Where were all the cows? Nothing in sight, all I could see was buildings and tracks. Where were they all leading to?\" The experience was riddled with perplexing incomprehension, temperamental clashes and rigid stereotyping. In the 50s and 60s, the Irish were building England, as one man on the building sites put it belligerently in the film: \"Go down to Camden Town in the morning, go to the Brecknock in the morning, go to the Nag's Head just at the Seven Sisters Road, go up to the Archway, and ask me who was doing the work in this country? They were all Irishmen. Who built the road at the Nag's Head? A man from Dingle. That was the man who put it through with Irish labour.\" It was the son of such a man who, when asked at school, \"Who made the world?\" answered: \"McAlpine.\" They were known as McAlpine's Fusiliers, working in horrible conditions, famed in story and mocked in song: \"As down the glen came McAlpine's men with their shovels slung behind them/ We sweated blood and we washed down mud with quarts and pints of beer/ I remember the day that the Bear O'Shea fell into a concrete stair/ What Horeseface said, when he saw him dead, well it wasn't what the rich call prayers/...If you pride your life, don't join, by Christ, with McAlpine's Fusiliers.\" In the 50s, the English confronted them with the first of a series of prejudices. \"Paddy ye ran home when the war started!\" the English would say. In Donnellan's film, a man angrily rebuts this: \"There's lots of things I want the English people to understand. I've got a brother with a leg and an arm missing that fought for this country. My father fought from 1914 to 1918, two uncles killed at Dunkirk and my brother is at home now with a 10-guineas-a-week British army pension.\" They worked their way through layers of prejudice. By the 70s, it was their perceived sympathy with the IRA bombing campaigns. They kept their heads down after the Aldershot bombing - when some stores refused to stock Kerrygold butter (though Guinness was never withdrawn). The Birmingham bombing brought a deep insecurity to the settled community. But it passed and the Canary Wharf devastation resulted in no serious backlash. In the late 60s, the Irish shifted from a taboo against mixing in English politics (as distinct from sabotaging it) to direct involvement through the local Labour party. They already had Callaghan and Healey, never convincing representatives of Irish mentality. Now they got their own MP - and he sat (against all republican principles) in the House of Commons. Michael O'Halloran was elected MP for north Islington, a man who stood firm on Irish Catholic values (or not, as the occasion demanded). The Irish were on the way up. The roads had been built, the spaghetti junctions laid, the pubs serviced. Now they went into business on a massive scale. For a long time, they remained faithful Labour supporters. The Irish staged in 1965 the most dramatic public example of native culture: a hurling match at Wembley, billed The Fastest Game in the World (and the most dangerous). Later, prime minister Edward Heath was said to have expressed a willingness to attend what became an annual event. But the Irish were not yet ready for the Tories. In his book, The Irish In Britain (1972), Kevin O'Connor reported that \"such an invitation was not forthcoming from the Irish\". Bloody Sunday in Derry in January 1972 delayed the unthinkable move of the Irish to the Tories. But it became inevitable, and first to cross the line were the middle-class business community. As the Irish moved up the social ladder, their reputation for uncouth living and criminal tendencies - spectacular in the 50s - shifted onto blacks. From 1950 to 1960, although they represented only 2-3% of London's population, the Irish accounted for 7-12% of violent crime in the metropolis. Soon their Irishness became, even for themselves, less of a factor. There is less vomit nowadays on the decks of the boat from Dun Laoire. In any event, Ryanair long ago goosed Aer Lingus into providing cheap flights. The exile feels less stranded here; and, with this mobility, the many-tentacled communications systems and the new tiger economy, the anguish of exile is less visible; it has become a more private, discreet thing.

God knows what he was expecting. Oldman plays a right-wing senator, a creature of the Gingrich ascendancy, who vows to derail Joan Allen as a mid-term replacement vice-president. Oddly enough, Oldman sees his character as the hero of the piece, which is a bit like saying Joe McCarthy and Roy Cohn were the heroes of the 1954 Army-McCarthy hearings, and not army lawyer Joseph Welch.

      "body": "<p><strong> Cameron Crowe</strong><br></p> <p>Music is still my first love. In a lot of ways, making the movie is an exercise in getting to the point when you can be in a dark room with all the records and putting the music on the movies. I never grew up studying movies or wanting to go to film school. I loved movies, but to me it was all about music. </p> <p>Doing a film portrait of 1973 was something I talked about for a long time. Initially, I wanted to write about Lester Bangs, who was a real vivid character of the day. I got side-tracked with a bunch of projects after Jerry Maguire; then a friend of mine said, what are you screwing around with these other ideas for? You're either going to do your script about 1973 or you will have talked about it and never done it. It's the kind of the thing someone says to you at the perfect time and it's like a dagger. The truth was, I kept all the artefacts from those days, all my old articles and all the touring room lists and all the backstage passes - they've all been in boxes that have never been put away. I've been living among the boxes for 27 years, and it was time to write the script and capture that thing that was still gnawing away at me. </p> <p>It was down to my mom that I got into journalism so young. Like the character of Elaine in the movie, she was a teacher who believed in an accelerated childhood. She decided I was going to be the last kid she was going to have, and she was going to try her theory out on me. In essence, it was to go to summer school, and acquire as many course units as possible, so you would graduate early, and see the world and start your career. If you were going to take time off, her theory was to put all the summers together, and take your vacation when you graduate high school before you go to college. </p> <p> So I went to school every summer; I was the pale, egghead student. Then I discovered rock music, courtesy of my sister. Just like my mom's worst fears, rock 'n' roll came in through the window, underneath the door, all around her, and it changed both my sister and me. I was making phone calls, and getting assignments from editors who didn't know how old I was. Her plan of the accelerated educational programme gave me the confidence to do all that stuff. By the time I came to her and said, you never let me have a summer, but now I want to go on the road with the Allman Brothers, she sort of gritted her teeth and let me do it. </p> <p>My first exposure to music magazines came via a shop in San Diego where they sold Zap Comix and rock magazines. There was a guy who worked there would let me look, even though you were supposed to be 18 - it was like porno. I thought the guys that wrote for them were the greatest people - they might have trashed the music, but respected it and lived the rock 'n' roll lifestyle. There was an underground paper in San Diego, the San Diego Door, and my sister used to go out with a guy who worked for them. On the condition I wouldn't tell mom, they took me to a meeting. I wanted to do record reviews for them - and when I asked, of course they said no. Music was the tool of the corporations. Then they thought, we need the advertising from the record companies. Next thing, they told me about another guy who sent in record reviews to them - and it was Lester Bangs. </p> <p>In the movie, William is constantly trying to define what's real and what's not as the Stillwater tour continues. Lester Bangs is the only guy who says that it's all a dirty industry. Yet these people - the band, the groupies, William - are all kidding themselves that they're part of a family when they're really part of an industry. It's more of an industry as it goes on. But this film is filled with contradictions, more than any of my other ones. People are continually contradicting themselves. Even Lester is a contradiction. In the longer version of the movie - our first edit, which we'll put out when the movie goes to DVD - Lester's jealous because the kid got an assignment at Rolling Stone. </p> <p>In 1973 I went into the offices of Rolling Stone in San Francisco for the first time. Before this I had been a freelance journalist working on the end of a phone to music editor Ben Fong Torres. I'd done my first piece for them in January of that year, an interview with Poco, with Richie Furay. They paid me $350 for it. A few months later, Jann Wenner, Rolling Stone's editor, wrote me, saying: \"You may turn out the youngest Rolling Stone man ever...\" </p> <p>The Allman Brothers Band was my first major assignment for Rolling Stone. So much of it became the movie. I was 15. My mom still thinks I'm gonna go to law school. She still says: you left home when you were 15 and never came back; if I'd known who Led Zeppelin were then I'd have never let you do it. At the time I used to say: \"Listen to Stairway to Heaven! These are intelligent, committed, enthusiastic gentlemen!\" </p> <p>The thing is, when I first got out there on the road and was writing about the Allman Brothers and Led Zeppelin and the Who and Lynyrd Skynyrd - and Neil Young; it wasn't the version of rock we think of today. It wasn't the penthouse-suite, we're-so-removed-from-our-fans, let's-all-be-rich-and-happy... The whole fat rich rock star thing happened later. '73 was, for me, always the year where it felt like the last moment before rock became a little less personal, a little more global. What I saw was the time before the period that's been captured in the movies in a kitsch way. A lot of that stuff came later. To me, there was a great feeling of us against the world in most of these bands. Then, all of rock music sold about the same as one Shania Twain album now, so it was a little more personal; these guys seemed to be in it for the feeling they got on stage, and hopefully girls and acclaim after that. Being too young for the girls and guys I was going to school with, it was the wildest thing to be taken in by Pete Townshend, for example. Of course, it didn't occur to me at the time that a lot of the motivation would be to get a good article out of me. But to me it was a very committed thing - it was a 70s without mirror-balls and without a lot of the faux grooviness that has been portrayed in the media. By the end of the 70s, it was a much different thing, and you had bands like the Eagles and Fleetwood Mac selling tens of millions of records. </p> <p>The interesting thing about the bands were that a lot of them were British - they were the remnants of the British Invasion. At the time there were a few albums that had gotten deep acclaim, that were loved deeply and were thought of as really powerful serious pieces of music. Who's Next, Led Zeppelin 2, Derek and the Dominos' Layla - these were albums that defined that period. But hard rock felt more American. American kids just went nuts for hard rock. Even Townshend said at the time - like with Won't Get Fooled Again - these are American youth anthems that we had no idea had such power over the audience. Led Zeppelin never took an ad on any of the tours I was on. It was all word of mouth. And they never had singles. It was all a private thing. It's kind of like Metallica now. </p> <p>Then there was the Zeppelin tour I went on; that also contributed a lot to the movie. As many people probably know, Rolling Stone tore into all of their albums. So Jimmy Page said that he'd never talk to Rolling Stone, even though Rolling Stone always wanted to put them on the cover. The LA Times sent me on tour with them, and to convince them to do Rolling Stone, I stuck around on the tour with them. And as in the movie, a couple of days turned into a long three-week tour. My eyes got blood-red because I didn't get any sleep. One by one, they all said they'd do it; except for Page, who kept saying: \"In another city, I'll make the decision.\" Of course, that becomes the focus of the movie, too, as Russell Hammond continually plays the same game with William. </p> <p>By the end of the 70s I started to burn out on journalism. I was taking on too much and taking too long with stories. I didn't know how much further I could go. I wanted to interview Marvin Gaye, but he wasn't doing any more interviews, and I really wanted to do a Rolling Stones story for Rolling Stone. That was when I started on Fast Times at Ridgemont High. Having exhausted rock journalism and having kind of hit a wall, I wanted to write this book that would be about high school and the experience I didn't have, because of my mom skipping me all those grades. I took to it immediately, because I thought it was almost more rock than rock, to write about the high school experience. Ironically, I found this entire school year was about the fact that Led Zeppelin was going to come to town; and everyone was gearing up for Zeppelin. And then Bonham died, and the tour was cancelled, and it really did change lives. The original title of Fast Times was Stairway to Heaven. I was still writing about rock, but from a different perspective. </p> <p>Celebrity journalism is different now. The story the kid files at the end of the movie, he's been the mediator a little bit, and left some of the warts out, but left quite a few of them in, and made his moral judgment on the band, and wrote about what he saw. Now, though, pieces don't get as long, the access is way different, and way cut down, all this stuff happens in a hotel room on a junket for 30 minutes. It's a different environment. There are a number of times where the bands or musicians I was writing about back in the 70s - Neil Young for example - would say: write about what you see. Part of that is that they wanted to see their life mirrored back to them; it's therapy in a way. They want to get your perspective on what's going on - how do I appear to the outside world? Of course, you never appear the way you think you do, so whenever you hold up a mirror to somebody, they're going to see things that bother them. </p> <p>The main effect of my Rolling Stone career was that I felt like I had a place in the world. I could write about this thing that I loved so much; and as rough as it was, and caught in the middle as I was, I guess it was my persona back then. I ran into Stephen Stills at a football game a year and a half ago, and he introduced me to his wife. Here's how he introduced me. \"This is Cameron. He was a fan who always got caught in the middle between wanting to be friends with us, and wanting to please Rolling Stone, who didn't like us as much as he did.\" I thought: wow, what happened to the power and mystery of journalism and writing? That was the role I played: the fan who had several masters to serve - one of which was...me. </p> <p> <strong>Charles Shaar Murray</strong><br></p> <p> 1973 as a rock and roll Annus Mirabilis? Six thousand miles away from the old Rolling Stone office in San Francisco, it felt more like a fancy-dress party somewhere in Teenage Wasteland the morning after the revolution didn't happen. For 15-year-old Cameron Crowe, torturing his mom with Led Zeppelin and the Allman Brothers Band it may have seemed as if a depoliticised version of the rock'n'roll hippie dream was still in full effect, but John Lennon had already announced that \"the dream is over\", and within the shabby confines of New Musical Express's funky, down-at-heel offices in Long Acre, it was - in the words of Bryan Ferry - \"time to try for something new.\" </p> <p>I'd arrived at the NME the previous summer, just before turning 21, having been headhunted from OZ and IT - the Brit underground press - and bringing their agenda with me. This meant being FOR sex, drugs and freaking out the squares by any means necessary, and AGAINST racism, corporate rock and Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer. By this time, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin and Jim Morrison were dead, the Beatles had broken up, the Rolling Stones were wearing their cynicism on their (album) sleeves, Bob Dylan was off somewhere being gnomic and incomprehensible, Sly Stone was sinking into hard-drug decline, and radical idealism was sprawled bleeding outside Kent State university or locked up with the Black Panthers. In America, nevertheless, it was still possible to pretend that the 60s were still alive: in Britain it wasn't. </p> <p>My generation of British rock writers had drawn an enormous amount of inspiration from the likes of Rolling Stone, which had in its first few years blasted a path for an entirely new kind of rock writing, but then settled into woozy complacency. The most inspiring of the pioneers were Greil Marcus - who brought critical rigour, piercing insight and vaulting intellectual ambition to the milieu - and Lester Bangs, whose infectious passion and furious irreverence towards established proprieties and standardised verities struck a chord with every would-be iconoclast. </p> <p>It was Lester's next port of call, Detroit's Creem magazine, that provided us with our most enduring American model. Creem was edgy where Rolling Stone was mellow; satirical where Rolling Stone was sycophantic; fun where Rolling Stone was, let's face it, dull with a capital DUH. Creem's photo captions (many of them written by Lester, as we later discovered) were either surreal jokes or sardonic digs at their subject. Where the British pop weeklies of the era treated their readers like besotted teenyboppers and their rockier equivalents addressed their punters as if they were aspiring roadies, Creem talked to you as if you were smart, adventurous and passionately committed to the music as a source of both fun and redemption. As we were, or thought we were. </p> <p>NME's ethos was straightforward: power to the people. The people in question being our readers, who had first call on our loyalty. We despised the record industry, gave not even two hoots for the sensitivities of our publisher or the profits of their shareholders, and relentlessly satirised even favourite musicians like Bryan Ferry - whose ludicrous clothes and fragile ego inspired us to seek endlessly for new ways to misspell his name. (The most memorable included Brain Fury, Biriyani Ferret, Byron Ferrari, Brown Furry and Brawn Fairy.) Americans had no idea what to make of us. Taking the piss out of the stars verged on l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9, if not outright sacrilege. </p> <p>Of course, the intrinsic differences between the British and American rock scenes were massive. America was a very big, very wealthy country where supergroups lurched around a circuit of huge arenas playing to vast crowds stuffed full of drugs. Britain was a small country with very few enormodomes and considerably lower disposable incomes. Which meant that the biggest of the British bands - Led Zeppelin, the Who, the Rolling Stones - followed the dollar and effectively became American groups: as remote from UK audiences as the Allman Brothers (who never played Britain until after guitarist Duane Allman, their star attraction, had croaked) or the Grateful Dead. Nowadays, MTV can carry a new trend all over the US almost in real time, but in the early 70s the sheer size and scale of the place meant that change occurred with agonising slowness; whereas in tiny little Britain the speed of pop-cultural events was exhilaratingly accelerated. </p> <p>The Allmans may have been the bees' knees for Rolling Stone's readers, but as far as the NME was concerned, cosmic cowboys with cocaine crusted in their walrus moustaches were last decade's thing. For us, 1973 was about the science-fiction glam-rock of David Bowie and Roxy Music, and the hypnotic new groove filtering over from Jamaica. Our taste in Americans ran more to proto-punks like Iggy Pop and the late, lamented MC5 than to hayseed millionaire hippies like Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash, and our midnight turntables were more likely to be spinning Bob Marley's Burnin' or Iggy's Raw Power than any Mellow Mafia mumblings from LA. We spent the first half of the 70s willing punk into existence, though, for some of us, when it finally arrived it wasn't quite what we ordered. </p> <p>So: Golden Age of what, exactly? Well, if 1973 represented anything of that nature, it was the golden age of promotional expenditure and all the concomitant opportunities to bite the hand that fed us. In those days, record companies seemed to have unlimited amounts of money to blow on dumb stunts to promote dumber records, and we considered it our revolutionary duty to make sure that they spent as much of it as possible on entertaining us. Coaches would be chartered to schlep several dozen lurching, reeling hacks to see risibly useless bands at Bristol Colston Hall. Beer, wine and non-vintage champagne would flow as press officers, prettily accoutred in the latest company T-shirts, sauntered down the aisles dropping large chunks of hash and fresh packs of Rizla papers into passengers' waiting hands. No conceivable album was so inconsequential a cultural event that it didn't arrive bundled with T-shirts and badges, or wasn't marked by a launch party. Sometimes the bands would actually perform, which was irritating but often unavoidable. </p> <p>Indicate that you might, under certain circumstances, be prepared to write a 400-word concert review of some dodgy combo and the next thing you knew another press officer would be flying you to Amsterdam, buying you a stupefyingly expensive dinner, taking you on a tour of the red light district and uncomplainingly parting with corporate wedge to buy you a wrap of overpriced cocaine. Then you'd get home, slide behind the typewriter for 15 minutes and slag the band off. Oh how we laughed! </p> <p> The time-honoured institution of the press junket was the vehicle through which I met, albeit on different occasions, both Cameron Crowe and Lester Bangs. The teenage Crowe was the very soul of amiability: relaxed and confident beyond his years, as well he might be, considering that he was a top writer for a major publication and made considerably more money than any of us did. Bangs, despite his fearsome reputation, was a genial bear of a man and, on his visits to NME, was sufficiently sober to converse perceptively, charmingly and - bogglingly enough - quietly. </p> <p>As rock writers go, Bangs and Crowe could not have been more different. Crowe, despite his considerable talents, was essentially a fanboy: a \"friend of the stars\" who rarely upset the applecart by expressing a controversial opinion. He had the kind of presence which relaxed his subjects, made them feel protective towards him, encouraged them to open up. This is a considerable asset for an interviewer, make no mistake, and it paid off, big time. Lester, on the other hand, was essentially a critic, ranter and raconteur: a grimy prophet howling in the wilderness. His celebrated interviews with Lou Reed were knockabout classics of the genre - someone, incidentally, should adapt the transcripts of those interviews into a screenplay entitled Lester &amp; Lou before anybody here gets significantly older - but his scabrous attacks on the second-rate (especially the expensively-hyped second-rate) and passionate hymns to the transcendent power of loud, filthy noise forever barred him from the first-class lounge where publishers, performers, record companies and journalists smoothly network and conspire against the public interest. The world needs a lot more Lesters - it's a dirty job but somebody's got to do it - though comparatively few are prepared to pay the price. Lester paid it, in full, dying in 1982 at the age of 33. He died a stupid death after living a stupid life, but leaving behind him a body of work which virtually defines its genre. </p> <p>Cameron Crowe, on the other hand, will be remembered primarily for his movies. Though possibly not this one. </p> <p> \u0095 Almost Famous is the opening film of the LFF, screening at 7.30pm, November 1 at the Odeon Leicester Square and 3.15pm, November 2 at the Odeon West End. The movie will go on general release on January 26. The screenplay is published by Faber &amp; Faber at \u00a36.99.

      "bodyText": "Cameron Crowe Music is still my first love. In a lot of ways, making the movie is an exercise in getting to the point when you can be in a dark room with all the records and putting the music on the movies. I never grew up studying movies or wanting to go to film school. I loved movies, but to me it was all about music. Doing a film portrait of 1973 was something I talked about for a long time. Initially, I wanted to write about Lester Bangs, who was a real vivid character of the day. I got side-tracked with a bunch of projects after Jerry Maguire; then a friend of mine said, what are you screwing around with these other ideas for? You're either going to do your script about 1973 or you will have talked about it and never done it. It's the kind of the thing someone says to you at the perfect time and it's like a dagger. The truth was, I kept all the artefacts from those days, all my old articles and all the touring room lists and all the backstage passes - they've all been in boxes that have never been put away. I've been living among the boxes for 27 years, and it was time to write the script and capture that thing that was still gnawing away at me. It was down to my mom that I got into journalism so young. Like the character of Elaine in the movie, she was a teacher who believed in an accelerated childhood. She decided I was going to be the last kid she was going to have, and she was going to try her theory out on me. In essence, it was to go to summer school, and acquire as many course units as possible, so you would graduate early, and see the world and start your career. If you were going to take time off, her theory was to put all the summers together, and take your vacation when you graduate high school before you go to college. So I went to school every summer; I was the pale, egghead student. Then I discovered rock music, courtesy of my sister. Just like my mom's worst fears, rock 'n' roll came in through the window, underneath the door, all around her, and it changed both my sister and me. I was making phone calls, and getting assignments from editors who didn't know how old I was. Her plan of the accelerated educational programme gave me the confidence to do all that stuff. By the time I came to her and said, you never let me have a summer, but now I want to go on the road with the Allman Brothers, she sort of gritted her teeth and let me do it. My first exposure to music magazines came via a shop in San Diego where they sold Zap Comix and rock magazines. There was a guy who worked there would let me look, even though you were supposed to be 18 - it was like porno. I thought the guys that wrote for them were the greatest people - they might have trashed the music, but respected it and lived the rock 'n' roll lifestyle. There was an underground paper in San Diego, the San Diego Door, and my sister used to go out with a guy who worked for them. On the condition I wouldn't tell mom, they took me to a meeting. I wanted to do record reviews for them - and when I asked, of course they said no. Music was the tool of the corporations. Then they thought, we need the advertising from the record companies. Next thing, they told me about another guy who sent in record reviews to them - and it was Lester Bangs. In the movie, William is constantly trying to define what's real and what's not as the Stillwater tour continues. Lester Bangs is the only guy who says that it's all a dirty industry. Yet these people - the band, the groupies, William - are all kidding themselves that they're part of a family when they're really part of an industry. It's more of an industry as it goes on. But this film is filled with contradictions, more than any of my other ones. People are continually contradicting themselves. Even Lester is a contradiction. In the longer version of the movie - our first edit, which we'll put out when the movie goes to DVD - Lester's jealous because the kid got an assignment at Rolling Stone. In 1973 I went into the offices of Rolling Stone in San Francisco for the first time. Before this I had been a freelance journalist working on the end of a phone to music editor Ben Fong Torres. I'd done my first piece for them in January of that year, an interview with Poco, with Richie Furay. They paid me $350 for it. A few months later, Jann Wenner, Rolling Stone's editor, wrote me, saying: \"You may turn out the youngest Rolling Stone man ever...\" The Allman Brothers Band was my first major assignment for Rolling Stone. So much of it became the movie. I was 15. My mom still thinks I'm gonna go to law school. She still says: you left home when you were 15 and never came back; if I'd known who Led Zeppelin were then I'd have never let you do it. At the time I used to say: \"Listen to Stairway to Heaven! These are intelligent, committed, enthusiastic gentlemen!\" The thing is, when I first got out there on the road and was writing about the Allman Brothers and Led Zeppelin and the Who and Lynyrd Skynyrd - and Neil Young; it wasn't the version of rock we think of today. It wasn't the penthouse-suite, we're-so-removed-from-our-fans, let's-all-be-rich-and-happy... The whole fat rich rock star thing happened later.

And then Bonham died, and the tour was cancelled, and it really did change lives. The original title of Fast Times was Stairway to Heaven. I was still writing about rock, but from a different perspective. Celebrity journalism is different now. The story the kid files at the end of the movie, he's been the mediator a little bit, and left some of the warts out, but left quite a few of them in, and made his moral judgment on the band, and wrote about what he saw.

Indicate that you might, under certain circumstances, be prepared to write a 400-word concert review of some dodgy combo and the next thing you knew another press officer would be flying you to Amsterdam, buying you a stupefyingly expensive dinner, taking you on a tour of the red light district and uncomplainingly parting with corporate wedge to buy you a wrap of overpriced cocaine. Then you'd get home, slide behind the typewriter for 15 minutes and slag the band off. Oh how we laughed! The time-honoured institution of the press junket was the vehicle through which I met, albeit on different occasions, both Cameron Crowe and Lester Bangs. The teenage Crowe was the very soul of amiability: relaxed and confident beyond his years, as well he might be, considering that he was a top writer for a major publication and made considerably more money than any of us did. Bangs, despite his fearsome reputation, was a genial bear of a man and, on his visits to NME, was sufficiently sober to converse perceptively, charmingly and - bogglingly enough - quietly. As rock writers go, Bangs and Crowe could not have been more different. Crowe, despite his considerable talents, was essentially a fanboy: a \"friend of the stars\" who rarely upset the applecart by expressing a controversial opinion. He had the kind of presence which relaxed his subjects, made them feel protective towards him, encouraged them to open up. This is a considerable asset for an interviewer, make no mistake, and it paid off, big time. Lester, on the other hand, was essentially a critic, ranter and raconteur: a grimy prophet howling in the wilderness. His celebrated interviews with Lou Reed were knockabout classics of the genre - someone, incidentally, should adapt the transcripts of those interviews into a screenplay entitled Lester &amp; Lou before anybody here gets significantly older - but his scabrous attacks on the second-rate (especially the expensively-hyped second-rate) and passionate hymns to the transcendent power of loud, filthy noise forever barred him from the first-class lounge where publishers, performers, record companies and journalists smoothly network and conspire against the public interest. The world needs a lot more Lesters - it's a dirty job but somebody's got to do it - though comparatively few are prepared to pay the price. Lester paid it, in full, dying in 1982 at the age of 33. He died a stupid death after living a stupid life, but leaving behind him a body of work which virtually defines its genre. Cameron Crowe, on the other hand, will be remembered primarily for his movies. Though possibly not this one. \u0095 Almost Famous is the opening film of the LFF, screening at 7.30pm, November 1 at the Odeon Leicester Square and 3.15pm, November 2 at the Odeon West End. The movie will go on general release on January 26. The screenplay is published by Faber &amp; Faber at \u00a36.99. Charles Shaar Murray's Boogie Man: The Adventures of John Lee Hooker in the American Twentieth Century is currently available from Penguin Books",

      "body": "<p>Christopher Nolan's first film, Following, was an elusive thriller which for all its faults effected a strange tentacular growth in the mind. Even now, I find myself selling it to people in conversation - particularly Nolan's philosopher-burglar, a connoisseur of London's empty spaces, addicted to the transgressive thrill of trespassing on other people's intimate lives. In time, I'm sure Following will come to be seen as an occult classic about the capital city, to be compared with work by Chris Petit and Iain Sinclair. </p> <p>Now Nolan has gone to Hollywood and the result is a glossier, flashier follow-up, Memento, starring Guy Pearce and Carrie-Anne Moss. It is a film to induce exhilaration along with a tiny, acute stab of regret. The regret is that, while the melancholy search for a British movie renaissance continues, the most natural young movie talent this country has produced in ages evidently finds American to be his natural cinematic language. But the exhilaration is that his film is terrific: exciting, demanding, agile, sly, witty and fun. Bobbing and weaving for 112 minutes, it is a film which somehow manages to keep you off balance and on your toes. </p> <p>If Oliver Sacks wanted to write something in the style of Raymond Chandler, maybe Memento would be it: a complex thriller about time, memory and identity. Pearce plays Leonard Shelby, a guy who wakes up every morning without knowing where he is, or why he's there. This is because of a mental condition caused by being hit on the head by an intruder. Now Leonard has become obsessed with his mission to catch this man who - as he repeatedly explains to anyone who will listen - raped and murdered his wife. </p> <p>But he now has a short-term memory loss problem, meaning that although he can remember everything from before he lost his wife, now, after every 15 minutes, everything is wiped out. So Leonard has to take polaroids of key people that he meets, and vital facts have to be agonisingly tattooed on his body in case he loses handwritten notes. These shuffled photos and bizarre corporeal messages become Leonard's grotesque simulacrum of existence. </p> <p>\"How am I supposed to feel, when I can't feel time?\" Leonard moans. And, correspondingly, how is Christopher Nolan going to construct a thriller without the continuous thread of time and memory to slot its constituent scenes together? That he is able to do so, daringly abolishing normal narrative rules, is proof of a precocious imagination and technical facility. Nolan's seductive disruptions of story order recall Tarantino, Bryan Singer's The Usual Suspects, the puzzles of Nic Roeg, and the semi-amnesiac trope is familiar from Tom Tykwer's Wintersleepers. But Nolan's deployment of these structural devices is enjoyably distinctive. </p> <p>The key motif is the wound: Leonard begins the movie with two nasty and mysterious scratch marks on his left cheek; in successive scenes these are shown in random stages of bloom, like the Polaroids Leonard takes. And when Leonard meets the beautiful and enigmatic Natalie (Moss), a bartender and girlfriend of a local drug-dealer, she too is sporting a livid welt to the cheek and a split lip. </p> <p>\"How have they got these marks?\" is the question - and the answer comes in fragments, a jumbled tale of violence and double-cross. (It reminded me of an episode in Patrick McGoohan's The Prisoner, The Schizoid Man, when No 6 has to work out how long he's been unconscious from the condition of a bruise on his fingernail.) Like a creepy kaleidoscope, each nudge and twist seems to jolt the disordered pieces into a new pattern. </p> <p>Leonard's friends are also his tormentors. They claim to be helping him, but are they just using the poor muddled dupe to advance their own nefarious ends? It is not merely Natalie that Leonard has to worry about: there is also the deeply sinister Teddy (Joe Pantoliano), a chipper guy who appears to want nothing more than to help. Wherever Leonard is, whatever stage the narrative is at, whatever state his cheek-wound is in, the grinning Teddy is there, trying to help him find his wife's assailant. It is an excellent performance from Pantoliano, who attains a hideous, Mephistophelean potency. </p> <p>There's a twist in the tail, obviously; in fact a mighty lash in the tail, which somehow manages to be more shocking and upsetting for emerging from this weird, fractured puzzle. Memento is a film high on thrills and high on IQ - an impressive new step in the career of this heavyweight director.</p>",
