Bradford &amp; Bingley's 2.5m savers and borrowers, who were sent voting packs this week, will be giving up mutuality for far less. At the time of B&amp;B's first vote last year, windfall figures of \u00a31,000-\u00a31,500 were bandied about. But with the stockmarket much weaker, estimates of B&amp;B's windfalls are no higher than \u00a3815 and could be as little as \u00a3500. </p> <p>Pro-mutuality campaigners say the prospective windfall is so paltry that B&amp;B's 350,000 mortgage holders will be worse off after two or three years. Demutualised Halifax currently charges 7.74% on its variable rate, while mutual flag-bearer Nationwide Building Society charges 7.29%. On a \u00a360,000 mortgage the Nationwide borrower saves \u00a3204 a year, while on a \u00a3100,000 home loan it is \u00a3336. </p> <p>If B&amp;B moves its mortgage rate in line with Halifax and other demutualised lenders, then the extra interest payments are likely to wipe out the benefit of the windfall soon. </p> <p>The borrowers' vote will be crucial. B&amp;B's conversion cannot go ahead unless it receives a majority of borrowers' votes in favour. It also has to win the approval of 75% of savers and at least half of its savers must vote. Votes must be in by July 12 and the result will be announced on July 17. </p> <p>However, the savers' vote is likely to be much more strongly in favour of conversion, as hundreds of thousands of them are believed to be carpetbaggers with as little as \u00a3100 in their accounts. It is difficult to argue how a small decrease in their interest income will wipe out the benefit of the windfall. </p> <p>But even if B&amp;B wins 100% support from savers, the conversion will fail if 51% of the borrowers voting vote against. At last year's vote, not a proper conversion ballot but more of an opinion poll, 62% of B&amp;B members voted for conversion - but within that figure, 60% of borrowers voted against. So B&amp;B's conversion is not a foregone conclusion. </p> <p>Joining the battle to keep B&amp;B mutual is an all-party group of MPs led by Andrew Love, MP for Edmonton. He says: \"The tremendous Standard Life result places a whole new complexion on mutuality debate. Windfalls of \u00a35-6,000 did not attract majority support. Members took a long-term view. All the calculations show that the windfall benefit for borrowers will be exhausted after just three or four years.\" </p> <p>Mr Love is also pressing the Treasury to revise building society rules which mean that while 75% of savers have to approve a conversion, only 50% of borrowers have to do so. \"Borrowers have a larger long-term interest, so why don't they have a bigger voice? Savers are benefiting at the expense of borrowers.\" </p> <p>However, a spokesman for B&amp;B said: \"You have to bear in mind that the average mortgage length is actually 5-7 years, and the average size is \u00a350,000, not \u00a3100,000. What's more, borrowers will become shareholders, and therefore get dividends as well. We also have no intention of suddenly jacking up mortgage rates.\"</p>",

Whatever your spending plans, by the time you reach the airport departure lounge your wallet will have its own vapour trail of evaporating cash.</p> <p>There's something about all that spare time, the expert wheedling skills of children and the influences of too much food and drink that turns us all into travelling cash fountains, spraying money in all directions and leaving the credit cards with punishing sunburn and red wine hangover.</p> <p>So what can we do to limit the damage? Travel companies and banks all offer top tips for holiday cash.

Get to the airport as late as possible so you have no spending time:</strong> you'll arrive laden with cash and a misguided sense of optimism, making you extremely vulnerable to rash spending such as buying ridiculous holiday clothes you'll never wear or deciding you need something from the Daft Travel Gadget Shop, like a hat with a built-in reading lamp.</p> <p><strong>2. Changing money:</strong> ask if your own bank will change money without charging commission, as some accounts include this as an additional benefit \u00d1 for instance, the gold service current account with Lloyds TSB. Consider fixed-rate fees, rather than percentage charges, for buying larger amounts of foreign currency.</p> <p><strong>3. Annual insurance:</strong> if you're a regular traveller, annual insurance policies could well save you money. Even if you're only looking for one-off travel insurance, be careful about taking a policy included with a package deal not only because it won't be the cheapest, but also because the cover could be thinner than the plot of your airport novel.</p> <p><strong>4. Children:</strong> the age at which children become paying passengers on planes is two, so schedule your holidays to maximise free flying time.</p> <p><strong>5. Credit and debit cards:</strong> if you use credit cards as international cashpoint cards, get a debit card which can be used in machines abroad. Cards with the Cirrus symbol can draw cash straight out of your current account, saving you from racking up credit card bills.</p> <p><strong>6. Airport parking:</strong> this can be the shark in the paddling pool, quite capable of eating up more of your money than your flights. Check in advance about long-term parking costs, which might be enough to make a taxi or public transport preferable.</p> <p><strong>7. Hotel phones:</strong> make sure you know the rate they charge, because they can be a rip-off. I stayed in a hotel in Yorkshire a couple of months ago that charged almost \u00a31 a minute for calls to London.</p> <p><strong>8. Car hire:</strong> this can have an infuriating habit of becoming much more expensive than you expected. This has happened to me on several occasions, with all kinds of charges, taxes, insurance and assorted mark-ups pushing the price way above the quote given on the phone. We've taken to paying in advance by credit card, which seems to have cut down on the arguments over what we thought we'd agreed to pay.</p> <p><strong>9. Buying abroad:</strong> with sterling so strong against Euro currencies, it can be cheaper to buy goods when you arrive at your holiday destination, including bigger items such as a video camera or holiday basics that are more expensive at home, such as sun tan lotion. If you want to compare prices, check out online stores in the country you're visiting.</p> <p><strong>10. Unpaid labour:</strong> make sure you take all your holidays. The most appalling news I've heard this week was that almost two-thirds of employees fail to take their full holiday entitlement. According to recruitment company totaljobs.com, the average worker misses 3.6 days leave each year, which represents a \u00a36bn gift to employers.</p> <p>Call me a work-shy old slacker if you like, but this is madness - giving your wages to a Bigger Bonuses for the Bosses scheme. It might leave me broke, but I'm taking all my holidays. See you on the beaches. I'll be the one wearing the cap with the built-in reading lamp.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:coughlan_sean@hotmail.com\">coughlan_sean@hotmail.com</a></p>",

Overdrafts will not be available, but account holders will be able to write cheques, use cash withdrawal machines and gain access to reasonably priced loans. </p> <p>They will also be able to set up direct debit transfers, which should mean savings on bills such as gas, telephone and electricity. People who already have bank accounts but want their state benefits paid into a different account will also be allowed to bank with Universal, pushing the number of customers the Post Office is expecting up to 4m. </p> <p>The idea is rooted in the government's desire to cut its social security bill by paying benefits and pensions straight into bank accounts by 2003. The current system of paying benefits over Post Office counters costs the benefits agency \u00a3400m a year. </p> <p>By automating the service, the government thinks it can shrink this bill, although it acknowledges that old habits die hard and that customers used to drawing their benefit or pension in cash over the Post Office counter must continue to have this choice. </p> <p>It also forms part of a wider government rescue package for the Post Office's failing 19,000 branch network. With 94% of the UK population living within one mile of a Post Office, trade and industry secretary Stephen Byers said Post Offices are a crucial and trusted part of the country's fabric, providing valuable services to, among other things, isolated rural and deprived urban areas. But the network needs to modernise. </p> <p>However, with income from the benefits agency cut - the Post Office estimates it will only make \u00a3200m a year by administering Universal - the network will need to find other ways of raising money. Other ideas are for the Post Office network to act as a provider of general government information to the public. Facilities for training people on the internet and using the branch network as a focal point for community e-commerce are also being mooted. </p> <p>Other money raising ideas include closer partnership with commercial banks. At present, customers from Barclays, Lloyds, the Co-operative Bank and Cahoot, the Abbey National offshoot, can do basic banking transactions through the Post Office, but the organisation hopes to extend this system to other high street banks to make up its \u00a3200m shortfall. The Post Office also needs the expertise of the banks when setting up the system. </p> <p>Co-operating with the Post Office would be one way for the banks to meet the obligations placed on them by the Treasury to help the socially excluded, but a spokesman for the British Bankers' Association was vague about the amount of support the Post Office can expect from banks. </p> <p>\"High street banks are not a monolithic whole,\" he said. \"They have very different procedures and views on social exclusion. The devil is usually in the detail, so until formal talks are held with the banks it's hard to say which ones will want to support it.\" </p> <p>He added, however, that not all banks see low-income people as bad customers who will never take out loans, credit cards and mortgages. Some see the possibility of growing them into profitable customers, so if these banks see the Post Office initiative as a threat, we may see heightened efforts by some commercial banks to offer accounts to the worst-off. </p> <p>Universal will be jointly owned by the Post Office and the commercial banks which make a contribution. The government has hinted that it might provide some financial support but would prefer this to come from the banks. Basil Larkin, managing director of network banking at the Post Office, wants the government to pay a set amount for every account opened under the scheme. </p> <p>The Post Office will draw up a business plan in the next few months and is aiming to test the new system in a limited area by the end of the year.</p>",

At present, customers from Barclays, Lloyds, the Co-operative Bank and Cahoot, the Abbey National offshoot, can do basic banking transactions through the Post Office, but the organisation hopes to extend this system to other high street banks to make up its \u00a3200m shortfall. The Post Office also needs the expertise of the banks when setting up the system. Co-operating with the Post Office would be one way for the banks to meet the obligations placed on them by the Treasury to help the socially excluded, but a spokesman for the British Bankers' Association was vague about the amount of support the Post Office can expect from banks. \"High street banks are not a monolithic whole,\" he said. \"They have very different procedures and views on social exclusion. The devil is usually in the detail, so until formal talks are held with the banks it's hard to say which ones will want to support it.\" He added, however, that not all banks see low-income people as bad customers who will never take out loans, credit cards and mortgages. Some see the possibility of growing them into profitable customers, so if these banks see the Post Office initiative as a threat, we may see heightened efforts by some commercial banks to offer accounts to the worst-off. Universal will be jointly owned by the Post Office and the commercial banks which make a contribution. The government has hinted that it might provide some financial support but would prefer this to come from the banks. Basil Larkin, managing director of network banking at the Post Office, wants the government to pay a set amount for every account opened under the scheme. The Post Office will draw up a business plan in the next few months and is aiming to test the new system in a limited area by the end of the year.",

      "body": "<p>The Juliet Letters, Elvis Costello's collaboration with the Brodsky Quartet, saw a classical ensemble working in the loose, creative manner of a rock or jazz group. They made music in the studio and the lines between writing, arranging, performing and recording became blurred. That experience inspired ex-Brodsky violinist Michael Thomas to score and conduct a whole Costello-based evening with the Composers Ensemble of piano, flute, clarinet and four strings. The atmospheric Almeida provided all the signifiers of hardcore contemporary, from the rows of empty seats to the silent pauses and shuffling of hastily copied parts between numbers: no crossover nonsense here. </p> <p>Hearing Costello's songs as chamber music, without the cracked varnish of the master's voice, is a surprise: with its resolutely British melodic invention and chord twists it's like Darmstadt never happened. Shaky at first, the band gained confidence throughout the evening. Thomas's nervousness vanished whenever he picked up the fiddle to augment the band or play solo (for a superb Birds Will Still Be Singing). Narrator Johnny Brown, with jet black hair, black sweater and jeans, added a punkish element to several numbers, as he ranted Costello's acerbic words (including Stalin Malone) over the intricate charts. </p> <p>Thomas's arrangements covered all bases: he confessed his fear that he had \"gone too far\" in the virtuoso coda to Couldn't Call it Unexpected, but this was well within the compass of the performers. Playing the simple bits was more tricky. </p> <p>A big surprise came when Thomas grabbed the microphone. Classical musicians do burst into song from time to time - from avant-garde chanting to the Gogmagogs' fine John Tavener piece - but you sensed that this was a rite of passage for Thomas. His vocal performances, on songs such as King of the Unknown Seas and his own Ruin, were moving and naked in a way that the ensemble wasn't. Apparently Thomas decided to do this at the last minute. It was clearly seat-of-the-pants stuff and I'm afraid it didn't always work. </p> <p>But for the finale the composer, who had been listening in the audience, climbed up to sing Favourite Hour. Despite Costello's modest \"I'm just another musician\" demeanour, he sang his heart out before the arrangement subsided into a lengthy coda for pianist Catherine Edwards. </p> <p>Super-8 images flickered on the unplastered back wall of the theatre. You could hear a pin drop. The event was an experiment, an unclassifiable, unpredictable curiosity and a rare treat for completist Elvis fans.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The Juliet Letters, Elvis Costello's collaboration with the Brodsky Quartet, saw a classical ensemble working in the loose, creative manner of a rock or jazz group. They made music in the studio and the lines between writing, arranging, performing and recording became blurred. That experience inspired ex-Brodsky violinist Michael Thomas to score and conduct a whole Costello-based evening with the Composers Ensemble of piano, flute, clarinet and four strings. The atmospheric Almeida provided all the signifiers of hardcore contemporary, from the rows of empty seats to the silent pauses and shuffling of hastily copied parts between numbers: no crossover nonsense here. Hearing Costello's songs as chamber music, without the cracked varnish of the master's voice, is a surprise: with its resolutely British melodic invention and chord twists it's like Darmstadt never happened. Shaky at first, the band gained confidence throughout the evening. Thomas's nervousness vanished whenever he picked up the fiddle to augment the band or play solo (for a superb Birds Will Still Be Singing). Narrator Johnny Brown, with jet black hair, black sweater and jeans, added a punkish element to several numbers, as he ranted Costello's acerbic words (including Stalin Malone) over the intricate charts. Thomas's arrangements covered all bases: he confessed his fear that he had \"gone too far\" in the virtuoso coda to Couldn't Call it Unexpected, but this was well within the compass of the performers. Playing the simple bits was more tricky. A big surprise came when Thomas grabbed the microphone. Classical musicians do burst into song from time to time - from avant-garde chanting to the Gogmagogs' fine John Tavener piece - but you sensed that this was a rite of passage for Thomas. His vocal performances, on songs such as King of the Unknown Seas and his own Ruin, were moving and naked in a way that the ensemble wasn't. Apparently Thomas decided to do this at the last minute. It was clearly seat-of-the-pants stuff and I'm afraid it didn't always work. But for the finale the composer, who had been listening in the audience, climbed up to sing Favourite Hour. Despite Costello's modest \"I'm just another musician\" demeanour, he sang his heart out before the arrangement subsided into a lengthy coda for pianist Catherine Edwards. Super-8 images flickered on the unplastered back wall of the theatre. You could hear a pin drop. The event was an experiment, an unclassifiable, unpredictable curiosity and a rare treat for completist Elvis fans.",

It is an impossible situation for both parties.\" Although transfers between Liverpool and Everton have been common over the past 15 years, no player has moved from Goodison to Anfield since Dave Hickson crossed Stanley Park 40 years ago. Everton will complete the \u00a33m signing of Alessandro Pistone on a five-year deal from Newcastle United today if the Italian defender passes a medical.",

Still they come, in solitary predetermined procession along Talbot Road or off the Metro - with their sandwich boxes and diverse private expectations. </p> <p>\"Athers\" of this parish, though occupied elsewhere for the day, offered dire words about county cricket but could not have been thinking of this particular neighbourhood ritual. </p> <p>Cardus yesterday gazed down sideways from his photographic frame in the press box. At times the Lancashire pair Glen Chapple and Mike Smethurst bowled with the commendable pace and direction that even evoked a sentimental sniff of Statham. </p> <p>The batting alas too seldom sustained the reputation of past illustrious deeds. Fifteen wickets fell, some needlessly. Lancashire ended on 149 for five, 15 behind. Mark Chilton, until failing to deal with a lifting ball, and Graham Lloyd, bowled off his pads, built the total. So did Sourav Ganguly, with the game's only six, before going recklessly for another to be out to a wonderful, one-handed catch by Ian Fisher off James Middlebrook. The slow bowlers are having a good match. </p> <p>Yorkshire were all out by the 60th over, their total still perhaps boosted a little by some indifferent fielding. There is nothing quite like a Roses match for your debut. Simon Widdup is the sixth Yorkshire player to make his first senior appearance this season; he stayed for nearly 90 minutes, not always comfortable and benefiting from occasional good fortune as he edged over slips for four. He had, however, seen his captain rapidly go to second slip, and Widdup went on to show application before pushing forward tentatively to Gary Keedy's opening delivery, to be caught easily at slip. </p> <p>At 126 for two at lunch Yorkshire appeared to be more than justifying their decision to bat. Darren Lehmann was rattling along, eager to attack anything wayward. Concentration broken, he was out the first over after lunch. </p> <p>It was left to Richard Blakey to give an increasingly crumbling innings some substance. He was sixth to go after a well made half-century, another victim of Keedy's left-arm perseverance. The slow bowler's three wickets must have been singularly rewarding against his native county. </p> <p>Yorkshire had four players away on test duty but the batting should not have tailed away as it did. The last eight wickets fell for 38 in 22 overs. </p> <p>Warren Hegg threw himself to his right to make a fine, low catch to dismiss Nathan Wood; it more than compensated for his lapse which allowed Blakey to escape on 22. </p> <p>This was Anthony McGrath's first championship game of the summer. It ended quickly when he was contentiously lbw to Chapple. Neil Fairbrother's body language was eloquent when he was similarly dismissed by Middlebrook. Was there ever a Roses match bereft of controversy?</p>",

      "bodyText": "The crowds may now be smaller yet the Roses' fervour and individual intensity defiantly survives. Still they come, in solitary predetermined procession along Talbot Road or off the Metro - with their sandwich boxes and diverse private expectations. \"Athers\" of this parish, though occupied elsewhere for the day, offered dire words about county cricket but could not have been thinking of this particular neighbourhood ritual. Cardus yesterday gazed down sideways from his photographic frame in the press box. At times the Lancashire pair Glen Chapple and Mike Smethurst bowled with the commendable pace and direction that even evoked a sentimental sniff of Statham. The batting alas too seldom sustained the reputation of past illustrious deeds. Fifteen wickets fell, some needlessly. Lancashire ended on 149 for five, 15 behind. Mark Chilton, until failing to deal with a lifting ball, and Graham Lloyd, bowled off his pads, built the total. So did Sourav Ganguly, with the game's only six, before going recklessly for another to be out to a wonderful, one-handed catch by Ian Fisher off James Middlebrook. The slow bowlers are having a good match. Yorkshire were all out by the 60th over, their total still perhaps boosted a little by some indifferent fielding. There is nothing quite like a Roses match for your debut. Simon Widdup is the sixth Yorkshire player to make his first senior appearance this season; he stayed for nearly 90 minutes, not always comfortable and benefiting from occasional good fortune as he edged over slips for four. He had, however, seen his captain rapidly go to second slip, and Widdup went on to show application before pushing forward tentatively to Gary Keedy's opening delivery, to be caught easily at slip. At 126 for two at lunch Yorkshire appeared to be more than justifying their decision to bat. Darren Lehmann was rattling along, eager to attack anything wayward. Concentration broken, he was out the first over after lunch. It was left to Richard Blakey to give an increasingly crumbling innings some substance. He was sixth to go after a well made half-century, another victim of Keedy's left-arm perseverance. The slow bowler's three wickets must have been singularly rewarding against his native county. Yorkshire had four players away on test duty but the batting should not have tailed away as it did. The last eight wickets fell for 38 in 22 overs. Warren Hegg threw himself to his right to make a fine, low catch to dismiss Nathan Wood; it more than compensated for his lapse which allowed Blakey to escape on 22. This was Anthony McGrath's first championship game of the summer. It ended quickly when he was contentiously lbw to Chapple. Neil Fairbrother's body language was eloquent when he was similarly dismissed by Middlebrook. Was there ever a Roses match bereft of controversy?",

When Gough began his test career, he passionately believed that, in his career, England could become the best team in the world. Now, as hard as he tries, he suspects he will rarely receive a better role than the hero in adversity. In diving to catch Sherwin Campbell's upper-cut to third man, the first West Indies wicket to fall, he was merely communicating that England's pride was intact, not seriously believing that they might win the match.</p> <p>Even Gough's late-order batting this summer has taken on the role of spirited tomfoolery. As he hooked Courtney Walsh for six, a shot he probably settled upon with Walsh halfway down his run-up, he might have been borrowing from Shakespeare's Henry IV, advocating: \"Doomsday is near, die all, die merrily.\"</p> <p>Andrew Caddick, Gough's new-ball partner, is not the sort to pack them in at the Comedy Store. An explanation, albeit a convoluted one, can be advanced as to why Caddick bowled so badly at the start of the first innings, and so well in the second. In the first innings conditions were helpful, but expectations were drainingly high; in the second innings, conditions were still helpful, but the crowd had virtually conceded defeat, and the stress levels were minimal. It is the art of exceeding expectations.</p> <p>He managed to dramatically change the mood of a few hours before. \"Embarrassing,\" smiled the woman serving at the southern fried chicken stall. \"Embarrassing,\" grinned the beery youth swaying a course through Jubilee Gardens. Embarrassing, embarrassing, embarrassing. Wherever one looked in mid-afternoon around a ground packed to capacity, one could only marvel at an English Test crowd's bottomless capacity to glean some sort of pleasure from abject failure.</p> <p>By some twisted coincidence, an internet cricket site sought yesterday to promote a worthless new statistical study which seeks to calculate the likelihood that a match \"might\" have been rigged, an assessment that relies entirely on how much a side might have played above or below the norm.</p> <p>If the norm mattered, cricket grounds would be empty. In 26.4 overs of the West Indies innings yesterday, a time of lurching emotions and honest endeavour, the whole thing was proved to be not only a nonsense, but a disgraceful one at that. For the sake of Test cricketers busting a gut, in success or failure, the International Cricket Council should bring in the lawyers.</p>",

No one exemplifies England at their bluffest more than Darren Gough. When Gough began his test career, he passionately believed that, in his career, England could become the best team in the world. Now, as hard as he tries, he suspects he will rarely receive a better role than the hero in adversity. In diving to catch Sherwin Campbell's upper-cut to third man, the first West Indies wicket to fall, he was merely communicating that England's pride was intact, not seriously believing that they might win the match. Even Gough's late-order batting this summer has taken on the role of spirited tomfoolery. As he hooked Courtney Walsh for six, a shot he probably settled upon with Walsh halfway down his run-up, he might have been borrowing from Shakespeare's Henry IV, advocating: \"Doomsday is near, die all, die merrily.\" Andrew Caddick, Gough's new-ball partner, is not the sort to pack them in at the Comedy Store. An explanation, albeit a convoluted one, can be advanced as to why Caddick bowled so badly at the start of the first innings, and so well in the second. In the first innings conditions were helpful, but expectations were drainingly high; in the second innings, conditions were still helpful, but the crowd had virtually conceded defeat, and the stress levels were minimal. It is the art of exceeding expectations. He managed to dramatically change the mood of a few hours before. \"Embarrassing,\" smiled the woman serving at the southern fried chicken stall. \"Embarrassing,\" grinned the beery youth swaying a course through Jubilee Gardens. Embarrassing, embarrassing, embarrassing. Wherever one looked in mid-afternoon around a ground packed to capacity, one could only marvel at an English Test crowd's bottomless capacity to glean some sort of pleasure from abject failure. By some twisted coincidence, an internet cricket site sought yesterday to promote a worthless new statistical study which seeks to calculate the likelihood that a match \"might\" have been rigged, an assessment that relies entirely on how much a side might have played above or below the norm. If the norm mattered, cricket grounds would be empty. In 26.4 overs of the West Indies innings yesterday, a time of lurching emotions and honest endeavour, the whole thing was proved to be not only a nonsense, but a disgraceful one at that. For the sake of Test cricketers busting a gut, in success or failure, the International Cricket Council should bring in the lawyers.",

Gallic stock has hardly been higher, certainly not since the 80s when Tigana was playing in the France midfield with Michel Platini, Alain Giresse and Luis Fernandez, Les Quatres Mousquetaires. And from the sidelines the former Lyon and Monaco coach, 45 last week, can claim much of the credit for developing the talents of Thierry Henry, Lilian Thuram and David Trezeguet. He also turned Emmanuel Petit into an international and helped Fabien Barthez become one of the best goalkeepers in the world. Fulham appointed him late last season after it was clear that they would miss promotion under Paul Bracewell. The new manager still speaks faltering English but it has improved in the past month and he points out that he does not need to speak perfectly to show his players what he wants them to do with the ball. He has already brought in his team of fitness coaches, doctors and even a dentist, and in two weeks' time he will take the squad to Clairfontaine, the training camp used by France during the World Cup two years ago and again this summer. Not many Nationwide League clubs can afford to use such facilities, but Tigana's reputation is matched by the owner Mohamed Al Fayed's financial backing. There is, of course, a flipside to having a multimillion kitty and a salary in the region of \u00a3500,000 a year: the pressure to succeed and put Fulham where Al Fayed wants them, not only in the Premiership but among the big boys. \"My ambition is to build a side to win promotion to the Premiership this season,\" said Tigana. \"I will bring my own experience to training, and the players' attitude to hard work is very important.

I understand there are more amazing revelations to come when the match-fixing hearing resumes in Cape Town. Ali Bacher, for instance, reckons that as well as the last World Cup and the 1998 England v South Africa series, the 1981 Ashes and the second world war were fixed too. I laughed when I first heard that but now I'm not so sure. After all, the overall losers of that latter contest (Germany) ended up with an awful lot of top quality leather jackets. Looking back it makes you wonder - was the first world war on the house as well?",

An early glimpse of what the English reaction to such an outcome would be was provided by Alec McGivan, the organiser of the 2006 campaign, yesterday morning. He was clearly baffled by Fifa's decision to regard Germany's as the more worthy bid.</p> <p>Therein, perhaps, lies the flaw in England's thinking. The cartoonist HM Bateman might have portrayed McGivan as The Man Who Thought Hosting The World Cup Was All About Nice Grounds. World Cup bids are more about global football politics than green grass.</p> <p>McGivan may be an experienced operator but, compared with what he has been up against in South Africa's Danny Jordaan and Lennart Johansson, the pro-German Uefa president, he is a lightweight. Two of the best-known personalities in the world game, Sir Bobby Charlton and Sir Geoff Hurst, have given England's bid considerable kudos but you need more than a pawn and two knights to win this sort of chess game.</p> <p>If England's campaign fires a blank in Zurich next week the critical Gatling guns will quickly find targets for blame. Some will argue that English hooliganism in Charleroi and Brussels during Euro 2000 and Johansson's threat to throw Keegan's team out proved to be the final straw for England's chances. Others will wonder if a nation under- going periodic bouts of xenophobia and regularly booing opposing national anthems at Wembley should ever have been considered a serious candidate in the first place.</p> <p>Then there is Wembley itself, still a museum of empire and much loved on cup final day but as suitable for staging a World Cup final as travelling to the moon by flying boat. Yes, there would be a marvellous new stadium in place by 2006 but so far not one bulldozer has been moved in nor one brick been moved out. In terms of Olympic stadiums, moreover, the Germans are already leading 2-1.</p> <p>Of course the heart of the matter is not about TV pictures of chair-throwing deadheads being dispersed by water cannon or the byzantine complexities of rebuilding Wembley. The truth is that, when it came to touting for the 2006 World Cup, England has always been behind the game.</p> <p>The Germans began their campaign some 18 months earlier on the understanding that, having backed England's wish to stage the 1996 European Championship, they would be left to garner European support for 2006 unmolested. When England announced a rival bid the Germans cried foul and Johansson supported them. </p> <p>Switching the English vote for the Fifa presidency from Johansson to Blatter in 1998 was not the Football Association's finest hour. Without European backing England has had to trawl the Third World for votes knowing that its natural sympathies lay with Africa. So it looks as though our World Cup bid will finish with neither trumps nor trumpets, just a feeling that the campaign could not make up in effort what it lacked in nous. One question will persist: was it really worth wrecking last season's FA Cup by allowing Manchester United to withdraw in order to win hypothetical brownie points from Blatter by turning up for his wretched Fifa World Club Championship?</p> <p>At the moment, in football, England appear to be losing all round.</p>",

He was clearly baffled by Fifa's decision to regard Germany's as the more worthy bid. Therein, perhaps, lies the flaw in England's thinking. The cartoonist HM Bateman might have portrayed McGivan as The Man Who Thought Hosting The World Cup Was All About Nice Grounds. World Cup bids are more about global football politics than green grass. McGivan may be an experienced operator but, compared with what he has been up against in South Africa's Danny Jordaan and Lennart Johansson, the pro-German Uefa president, he is a lightweight. Two of the best-known personalities in the world game, Sir Bobby Charlton and Sir Geoff Hurst, have given England's bid considerable kudos but you need more than a pawn and two knights to win this sort of chess game. If England's campaign fires a blank in Zurich next week the critical Gatling guns will quickly find targets for blame. Some will argue that English hooliganism in Charleroi and Brussels during Euro 2000 and Johansson's threat to throw Keegan's team out proved to be the final straw for England's chances. Others will wonder if a nation under- going periodic bouts of xenophobia and regularly booing opposing national anthems at Wembley should ever have been considered a serious candidate in the first place. Then there is Wembley itself, still a museum of empire and much loved on cup final day but as suitable for staging a World Cup final as travelling to the moon by flying boat. Yes, there would be a marvellous new stadium in place by 2006 but so far not one bulldozer has been moved in nor one brick been moved out. In terms of Olympic stadiums, moreover, the Germans are already leading 2-1. Of course the heart of the matter is not about TV pictures of chair-throwing deadheads being dispersed by water cannon or the byzantine complexities of rebuilding Wembley. The truth is that, when it came to touting for the 2006 World Cup, England has always been behind the game. The Germans began their campaign some 18 months earlier on the understanding that, having backed England's wish to stage the 1996 European Championship, they would be left to garner European support for 2006 unmolested. When England announced a rival bid the Germans cried foul and Johansson supported them. Switching the English vote for the Fifa presidency from Johansson to Blatter in 1998 was not the Football Association's finest hour. Without European backing England has had to trawl the Third World for votes knowing that its natural sympathies lay with Africa. So it looks as though our World Cup bid will finish with neither trumps nor trumpets, just a feeling that the campaign could not make up in effort what it lacked in nous. One question will persist: was it really worth wrecking last season's FA Cup by allowing Manchester United to withdraw in order to win hypothetical brownie points from Blatter by turning up for his wretched Fifa World Club Championship? At the moment, in football, England appear to be losing all round.",

      "body": "<p>In a team full of leaders, he has become the patron. Zinedine Zidane may not wear the captain's armband, and he seldom bothers to say very much, but he is the man to whom his team-mates turn for inspiration - and the man to whom the rest of Europe is looking to unlock the steel doors of the Italian defence in tomorrow night's Euro 2000 final, thus fulfilling the promise of a tournament which, until this week's semi-finals, appeared to have been dedicated to inaugurating an era of attacking football.</p> <p>Those who know Zizou best say that the introspection of old, the shyness of an immigrant's son from the housing projects who finds himself dining with presidents, has begun to fall away, and that he is becoming more at ease with his celebrity. But he will always be a man whose eloquence is primarily in his feet.</p> <p>Last week, in a rare flight of verbal fancy, he declared: \"At 28, I'm at the pinnacle of my art.\" It sounded a bit pompous, a bit uncharacteristic, even a bit French, and two days later he had reconsidered the matter. \"Maybe that was a little excessive,\" he said. \"Let's just say I'm at the top of my form.\" </p> <p>Yet his performances in the tournament suggest that Zidane is still finding new ways to express himself with a football. In the first half of the quarter-final against Spain he appeared to want to play the game only with the soles of his feet, stroking the ball with the blades of his boots simply because that gave him a more intimate contact with its surface - the difference between a punch and a caress. Against Portugal in the next round he showed us another dimension, an ability to overcome double marking by setting off on long slaloms in which he seemed to be skimming across packed snow while his opponents were trying to run through sand dunes.</p> <p>He is a big man, 6ft 1in and 12st 4lb, and his stooping gait can make him look ponderous, but his greatness lies in the delicacy of his touch and the subtlety of his mind. When he scored from a free-kick against Spain, he seemed to be feeling the precise texture of the ball through his boot and his stocking. When he took the \"golden penalty\" against Portugal he deployed the skills of a find-the-lady trickster, his eyes and his feet sending conflicting messages that hypnotised Vitor Baia into diving the wrong way. Earlier in the match he had set Bixente Lizarazu free on the left with a disguised six-foot backheel that was worth the price of admission alone.</p> <p>But his displays of unearthly skill are not Zidane's only contribution to the squad. During their preparations for the tournament, while they were encamped at Bourg Saint-Maurice in the Savoy Alps, Roger Lemerre remarked: \"When you see Zizou's appetite for work, his eagerness, his smile - well, that's reassuring.\" The coach was recognising that, unlike some superstars, Zidane is a vital ingredient in the social chemistry of a squad whose members relish their closeness so much that it seems as though as individuals they belong not to Juventus or Chelsea or Real Madrid or Arsenal but to a club called France. His special closeness is with Christophe Dugarry, a former Bordeaux team-mate with whom he shares ownership of a restaurant. To Dugarry's mother, Zizou is \"the sort of brother Christophe always wanted\".</p> <p>Born in La Castellane, a suburb of Marseille, the son of an Algerian father, he made his first division debut with Cannes at 17 before moving to Bordeaux in 1992. On his international debut in 1994, he scored both goals in a 2-2 draw with the Czech Republic. He joined Juventus after Euro 96 and won the Italian championship in his first season. The triumph at the Stade de France in 1998 brought him the title of the world footballer of the year to go with his L\u00e9gion d'Honneur ribbon.</p> <p>Naturally, the two goals he scored with his head in the final against Brazil enhanced his already extraordinary status. And, as many observers have noted, when Zidane is not around, France are not the same side. Against Paraguay in the World Cup, while he was serving a one-match suspension for trampling on a Saudi player, the team found themselves desperately lacking a creative force and were facing elimination until Laurent Blanc stepped forward to score a decisive goal in extra-time. England's fans will also remember the way Zidane presented the 18-year-old Nicolas Anelka with three goals (one of them unjustly disallowed) at Wembley two winters ago.</p> <p>\"This is certainly a better side than the France of 1998,\" he said after last week's quarter-final. \"We've all got another two years of experience in the best leagues in Europe. And this time we've got five forwards, all with great qualities, which we didn't have during the World Cup. We've also shown that we're adaptable - there isn't one ideal system because each match offers different characteristics, which means that all the 22 players are involved. Against the Czech Republic, for example, Youri Djorkaeff came on and scored a vital goal after he'd been criticised for his performance against Denmark. And the spirit of Christophe Dugarry is an asset to us because he's happy to play in any position and to put himself at the service of the team.\"</p> <p>In a tournament full of technical interest, the main focus of tactical debate has been the general eclipse of the great playmaker, a majority of sides preferring to place their faith in collective movement. \"I don't think the job of playmaker will disappear,\" Zidane offered, \"because it's something that gives people a lot of pleasure. I know that many teams prefer to play without one, but for me that diminishes the spectacle.\"</p> <p>And whatever the importance of team play, the stroke of individual genius is still the most effective way of determining the course of a football match, with the No10 shirt carrying a special significance in that respect. When Liam Brady, invited last week to comment on Zidane's qualities as a playmaker, remarked admiringly that he saw the Frenchman as \"a maker of goals rather than a maker of the game\", he was perhaps ignoring the fact that goals make games. Zidane may not sit deep in the manner of a Gerson or a Brady, but his hands are just as firmly on the strings.</p> <p>On Wednesday night in Brussels, in the five minutes of madness between the award of the decisive penalty and the taking of the kick, Zidane went off by himself to prepare for the task of finishing the match. Even after almost two hours of high-intensity action, his mind and his body were in perfect union.</p> <p>Talking of his development as a player, he has credited Juventus's fitness team - currently embroiled in a controversy over their alleged use of bodybuilding substances - with increasing his explosive power by 30%. \"But most of the improvement is psychological,\" he said. \"Italian football is the best education in the world.\" And tomorrow night the pupil will attempt to teach his masters a lesson.</p>",

The jury at the Old Bailey did not accept the defence plea that Copeland was acting under diminished responsibility. Copeland admitted causing explosions at Brixton, Brick Lane and Soho, London, over 13 days in April last year, killing three people and injuring 139. The blast at the mainly gay Admiral Duncan pub in Soho killed Andrea Dykes, 27, who was pregnant, and friends John Light, 32 and Nik Moore, 31, from Essex. The prosecution refused to accept Copeland's plea of guilty to manslaughter on the grounds he was suffering a mental illness - paranoid schizophrenia - which diminished his responsibility at the time. Copeland showed no emotion as the jury of four women and eight men returned their unanimous verdicts. People in the public gallery, including victims injured in Copeland's bomb attacks, cheered and clapped. Copeland received mandatory life sentences for each of the murders and three further life sentences for his bombings which targeted the capital's ethnic and gay communities. In a campaign that ran over three successive weekends last year, Copeland planted nailbombs in multiracial Brixton, the largely Bangladeshi community of Brick Lane and the gay quarter in Soho. Judge Hyam told Copeland: \"Nothing can excuse or justify the evil you have done and certainly not the abhorrent views which you have embraced. \"It is only too apparent from what you have said you have no feelings for those lives you have afflicted. \"The public must be protected from you and assured that if you are ever released it will not be for a very long time.\" The jury deliberated for six-and-a-half hours to reach its verdict. Copeland was led away to serve his sentence in Broadmoor high security hospital. Victim Tommy Douglas, who lost both legs in the blast at the Admiral Duncan pub in Soho, said he was relieved that David Copeland had been convicted of murder. \"I prayed to God that he would go down for murder. He's not a human being,\" Mr Douglas said. \"He has shown no remorse.\" Gary Reid, 44, who lost a leg and suffered other injuries in the Soho blast, said victims now felt a \"deep sense of relief and gratitude\".

I mean, getting down and dirty in the festival spirit is all well and good but wearing cider-stained tie-dye is beyond the call of duty.

Before festival-lovers get too offended, I'm not exempting myself from this criticism, I hasten to add: everything about festivals conspires to prevent you looking stylish. </p> <p>Festivals can defeat the most determinedly elegant of people. I have plenty of friends who refuse point blank even to entertain the idea of going to one purely because they aren't prepared to look that hideous in public. And for the fashion devotee, Glastonbury is the Mount Everest of festivals, the greatest challenge - the biggest, longest, most prohibitively expensive to reach by black cab. Three days of camping, miles to walk between stages, a lack of secure places to leave your stuff and bathroom facilities that leave a lot to be desired all add up to a fashion assignment from hell. </p> <p>Or is it really that hard? I can't help feeling some people just aren't trying. I mean, it wasn't even muddy. And looking a complete state on Sunday night is fair enough but on Friday lunchtime most punters already looked like they'd been living rough for months when in fact they had probably only been out of their new-edition VW Beetles for half an hour. So in order to prove it is possible to maintain sartorial standards at a festival, we sent a brave model down in this season's finest, to show that you can do the festival circuit in defiantly ungrungy style. If you balk at furry white designer boots, Chanel does lovely practical shiny pastel wellies for \u00a3130 - or do as the TV presenter dollies do and wear wellingtons when conditions force it to protect the hems of your Helmut Lang trousers from unsightly mud, but have an assistant on hand at all times with a pair of kitten heels to don whenever people are watching. </p> <p>Practicality need not be forgone entirely - leave the white cashmere palazzo pants at home but take movie-star sunglasses and your most chichi bag, and be sure to add a splash of colour with an armful of backstage pass wristbands.

      "body": "<p>He is one the most photographed men of the year. His image can be spotted around London, immortalised in a cult T-shirt in the style of Che Guevara. His tireless championing of the one-suit wardrobe has become a hot topic of media speculation. Yet Ken - for London's new mayor has reached Madonna status, no surname required - is still seldom recognised for the style icon he surely is. </p> <p>For all its unstudied air, the Ken look makes Martin Bell's anti-sleaze white suit look unpolitical. Ken's image is all about there being no image, no spin, no styling, a powerful political message that can hardly be entirely unconscious. The man-in-the-street's clich\u00e9d complaint of \"politicians, they're all the same\" is sidestepped by Ken's trademark mac-clad shuffle. Look at almost any photograph of a politician, cover the face and they are indistinguishable, unrecognisable. Ken, however, is undeniably, immediately Ken, from the slightly scuffed toes of his shoes to his woolly red scarf. </p> <p>The keynote Ken outfit comprises a comfy-looking suit the colour of Rich Tea biscuits and an oversized, flappy beige raincoat, with that red woollen scarf tucked sensibly under its lapels. It is a look that gives him both individuality and familiarity - among politicians, he never quite looks one of the guys, but put him on the top deck of a bus and he blends right in. In the mayoral campaign, he wore the biscuity suit almost constantly, provoking questions as to whether it was one and the same suit, or one of a rack of identical suits. In a photo opportunity-obsessed world, the one-suit trick impressed with its disregard for the voracious appetites of the paparazzi. It also showed a winning lack of interest in fashion.

Simply by stuffing things in his pockets and ruining the line of his coat and suit, Ken marks himself out as a man of the people. Distrustful of makeovers, the public warm to the fact that, leaving aside the disappearance of the moustache, Ken's style has changed little over 20 years - the suit had a more rakish safari-meets-donkey-jacket air in the GLC days and the mac had a wider lapel, but the overall look is similar. </p> <p>Then there's the scarf. Scarves have been out of fashion for men for years, but this is clearly of no interest to Ken. The scarf has particular connotations: it is this more than anything that gives him that indefinable Camden Town tapas bar, north London radical air. </p> <p>Like Mick Jagger, Ken has an innate, unshakable air of devil-may-care scruffiness. The antithesis of Gwyneth Paltrow, who can't help looking groomed and shiny even in jeans, Ken could look careworn in Tom Ford's finest. One of the most intriguing things about That Suit is the fact that I'm not entirely convinced it is a suit - the jacket never quite seems to match the trousers. There is a certain sagginess about Ken's wardrobe that makes the scruffiness endearing rather than threatening; and the unflattering pale, sludgy colours he favours lend his complexion an air of bloodlessness. In contrast to the stage-managed slickness of most politicians, Ken's look is defiantly human: witness the glasses he wore when his victory was announced. Triumphant in a drawn-out, vicious battle he might be, but he was also vulnerable enough to be too tired and red-eyed for contact lenses. </p> <p>This week, during the run-up to the official commencement of his term on Monday, Ken wore full morning dress to attend a black-tie event at the Guildhall celebrating the Queen Mother's 100th birthday, despite having ignored the dress code at another black-tie affair the previous week, at which he turned up in a normal suit. No-frills man of the people he might be, but snubbing the Queen Mum was a stop too far on the Clapham omnibus. </p> <p>As from next week, such sartorial headaches are likely to be the least of Ken's concerns, of course: in fact, he might find it easier to bypass the issue by adopting traditional mayoral garb, complete with white stockings and gold chain. It's not very likely, though: something tells me the Ken look is here to stay.</p>",

      "bodyText": "He is one the most photographed men of the year. His image can be spotted around London, immortalised in a cult T-shirt in the style of Che Guevara. His tireless championing of the one-suit wardrobe has become a hot topic of media speculation. Yet Ken - for London's new mayor has reached Madonna status, no surname required - is still seldom recognised for the style icon he surely is. For all its unstudied air, the Ken look makes Martin Bell's anti-sleaze white suit look unpolitical. Ken's image is all about there being no image, no spin, no styling, a powerful political message that can hardly be entirely unconscious. The man-in-the-street's clich\u00e9d complaint of \"politicians, they're all the same\" is sidestepped by Ken's trademark mac-clad shuffle. Look at almost any photograph of a politician, cover the face and they are indistinguishable, unrecognisable. Ken, however, is undeniably, immediately Ken, from the slightly scuffed toes of his shoes to his woolly red scarf.

Prison numbers are now Jack Straw's virility symbol. He boasts in a letter to the Telegraph that it was \"ludicrous\" of them to suggest he was \"soft on crime\" since he had locked up 4,500 extra since the election. Overcrowding means 12,000 prisoners are crammed two to a cell built for one, eating their meals in a tiny room with an open communal toilet. Blair's extra 4,000 will all be doubled up, making 20,000 overcrowded prisoners with no work or treatment. Due to lack of staff and facilities the prison service this year failed to hit its already low target for giving prisoners time spent purposefully - on learning, training, drug therapy, anger management or work.

It costs \u00a316,000 a year to send a boy to Eton but \u00a325,500 to send someone to prison for what Douglas Hurd this week denounced as \"an expensive way of making bad people worse\".</p> <p>Yesterday prison governors expressed their shock at the prime minister's words, fearing the pre-election year would herald more and worse.

They will show burglary and car theft down, but violent crime up again, by somewhere in the low teens. Reported crime figures are notoriously unreliable, depending on many variables. There's been a push to encourage more reporting of street robbery, up by an alarming 36% in London. A third of that, though, was schoolchildren robbing other schoolchildren, often grabbing each other's mobile phones with menaces. This is horrible, frightening bullying - I know a boy who's been shaken down twice this year in Lambeth, once reported, once not. But the figures don't distinguish between that and some drugged mugger sticking a knife in an old lady's face to steal her pension money. Homicide (always reported) is a good indicator of other violence (not always reported): London has five times less murder than New York, four times less than Amsterdam. Violence increases in good times when people have more money to spend on drink, while property crime gets worse when unemployment rises.</p> <p>But when it comes to politics, forget evidence, forget what works. Blair demands tougher sentences - and he will get them. The Home Office research department has a graph showing how judges adapt their sentencing habits to the prevailing political mood. Sentencing leapt up after Howard's \"prison works\" speech.

We're an entire demographic grouping of Trotskys. Like the once dapper Jew, we too stand with nonchalant unease at the base of that wooden pulpit, hastily erected on the platform of the Finland Station. Shorn of moustache and goatee our collective chin is rounded, awfully vulnerable, already anticipating the cold smack of the assassin's steel. Deprived of pince-nez our eyes are squinting into the limelight; what a mistake it was - we seem to be entreating future historians - to dress down for posterity. If only we'd kept our Trotsky costume on, not loaned our shoes to Lenin, then we wouldn't be facing this airbrushing out, this undeveloping, this eternal bloody deletion. </p> <p> Where, oh where are the old women of the twentieth century? Where have we all gone? So few films, photographs and television pictures include us. Even when we were featured, the real intention was to emphasise the props: see how old that coat is/bulky that sack is/worn out those shoes are. And next to the great men of the age we were merely mothers, or women-old-enough-to-be-their-mothers, or women whose age made us childlessness personified, as time turned tail and our old vaginas, like ancient vacuum cleaners, sucked up the unformed, the unbecome, the unborn. </p> <p> I'm not saying there haven't been exceptions, many many exceptions, crowds of exceptions like babushkas picking coal from the slag heap of the century. A legion of remarkable individuals humping hobo bundles down the road to where the einsatzgruppen were hard at it. Notable personalities grasping small, knobbly-haired heads between our withered dugs as the Interahamwe rampaged through the garden death-burbs of Kigali. Yes, we have been there. And I suppose, given our invisibility, our uselessness as anything but extras or crew - the gaffers, key grips and best boys of history - it's worth remarking that we were in fact there already. Yes, there before the director stopped shtupping his latest underage lover. There before the principals had any motivation, or the location had even been spotted. Like a herd of oblong-eyed goats, or a palisade of dead grass, or an enfilade of streetlamps, we were there. We old women - waiting for something to happen. </p> <p> And if there are drifts of old women blowing across the fields of the living, why be surprised that the same is true of the afterlife? You look at the cityscape and see us tottering about in our insupportable hosiery. Look again and realise that while many of us are clinging on to the ledge of life, many more have let go already. As the living grow older, a sterile wad of humanity blocking up the generative drain, so we, the dead, accumulate like pennies on the ledges of a cascade game. </p> <p> When the young die they're full of beans. Life hasn't exhausted them-why should death? Anyway, there are always vacancies in the provinces, or even abroad, for the morbidly mobile. Many young and middle-aged British dead work in the Gulf, the States, or even fucking Germany. But dead old women? Who wants us? In death as in life, we are the pavement-strollers, the window-shoppers, the bored, bunion-hobbled boulevardi\u00e8res. We're there waiting for something - anything - to happen. So we can be photographed, or filmed, or videoed, a backcloth of hysterectomies, in front of which events can be played out again, yet never exhausted. History is never in the round - it's always on a stage; and while the curtain may be death, why is it then that so many scrutinising eyes stud the proscenium, peering into the dimness of the stalls? Are they tragic or comedic masks - or not masks at all? </p> <p>Earlier this evening - if this still is evening, we've waited so bloody long - I, Lily Bloom, picked my way down Old Compton Street. Yet another dead old woman patrolling the West End on a misconceived mission. My lithopedion scampered between my ankles, my Rude Boy was prancing in the road. Ahead of us the snake-hipped figure of Phar Lap Jones moved in and out of the gay throng. He may be old, but he's black, he's slim and - of course - he's a karadji, a mekigar, a wizard. Full of buginja power, possessed of miwi magic. With his finely corrugated matt skin and his thriving restaurant business, he might, it's often occurred to me, be the ultimate leather queen. </p> <p> When I was alive I made it my business to zero in on my fellow biddies. Given a street scene like this - full of young people hurling themselves into the puppetry of lust, tying rubbery abandonment to their ankles and wrists before bungee jumping into orgasm - I'd've been taken by the tweed-wearers, the bearers of the capacious gusset and the porters of the nylon bag. The granny guild. I'd strike up conversations with these widows, spinsters and bints. I suppose I saw myself as a kind of reporter, researching a long article on the world, which turned out to be a profile of myself. I'd interview these old women, interrogate them as to who they were, what they were doing, where they were going, why they fucking bothered, and when they'd give it up. Later, I'd write their replies down in a notebook: </p> <p> 1. A Mrs Green, the widow of a minor civil servant. She lives in Hornsey in the house she owned with her husband, in a basement flat knocked out by the son and daughter-in-law who cannot wait to inherit. </p> <p> 2. She's going to the Old Bailey to sit in the public gallery. It's good, cheap, wholesome fun. </p> <p> 3. Her basement is hot in summer, cool in the winter; it's good to get out. </p> <p> 4. It's not a question that can be answered at her age. She understands that life is not so much a journey from one horizon to the next as a survey of the world all around. </p> <p> How wrong you were, Mrs Green. Indeed, I know you were wrong when I struck up that conversation with you, as you fumbled for the correct change by the ticket machine at Embankment, because this evening, as I paused by the sugary, munchy - and for me unreflecting - window of Patisserie Valerie, I saw you again. You were wearing the same worsted coat, now worsened by time, as you neatly stepped along the opposite sidewalk, hair coiled then crushed beneath a hat like a velour cowpat. Mrs Green, I never forget a face, even one as narrowly undistinguished as your own. Mrs Green, what were you doing in Soho? You have no need of butyl nitrate, or split-crotch panties, or charcuterie, or sushi. For shame. </p> <p> Your husband died, aged sixty, in 1961. I first encountered you in 1974, when you were over seventy yourself. It's 1999! Ferchrissakes woman - you're ninety-fucking-five, yet don't look a day older than you did during the Winter of Discontent (which is not now). 'Has it not occurred to you, Mrs Green,' I might've let drop as I came alongside, 'that you must have died many years ago? That you are, indeed, dead - but won't lie down?' </p> <p> 'Ooh, I don't think so, dearie,' she might've replied. 'I mean to say, I still keep my flat up, pay the bills and such, do the shopping, go to bingo. I shouldn't be able to do all those things if I were dead, now would I?' </p> <p> Oh but you can do them, Mrs Green. More than that, now that you're freed from the relentless popping of your cellular bubblewrap such tasks are a breeze, n'est-ce pas? </p> <p> 'But what about my Derek? He'd know I was dead - surely?' </p> <p> 'Oh, would he now - good at keeping in touch, is he?' </p> <p> 'We-ell, he's busy- ' </p> <p> 'For life?' </p> <p> 'I'm sorry?' </p> <p> 'For life - he's been busy his entire fucking life, has he? Busy these past ten, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five years? Too busy to bother with an Abbey Crunch and a cup of milky tea - is that it then?' </p> <p> 'We-ell.' </p> <p> 'Well - nothing, nada, rien du tout. The well of life - pah! The well of death, woman - that's what you're down. Nope - you're dead. The reason your son doesn't keep in touch is that you're dead - and he's dead too! He died in the early eighties. First the cardiac arrhythmia, like a drum figure falling apart, then the big wrench to nowhere. Then Woking.' </p> <p> 'Woking?' </p> <p> 'Woking, Surrey, that's where he's spending his death. As to how come he doesn't keep in touch? Well, the dead find it just as hard as the living, you know - keeping in touch. It's an effort to call, to write, to pay a visit. Especially when your mother's dead but doesn't even realise it. Not that you don't have your uses, you know.' 'Uses?' </p> <p> 'You're an unquiet spirit - of sorts. Like all the unknowing dead, you're an exchange point between the living and the dead. This is true of many who die in their sleep, or inattentively, in stupors and fogs. If you don't know you're dead - and nor do the living - then it's easier for you to shout across the Styx than call along its banks. You could, for instance, take a message to my daughter Natasha.' This might have galvanised decrepit Mrs Green a bit; no one has asked her to do anything much but pass things - and only small things at that - for the last quarter-century. </p> <p> 'Your daughter, eh? What would you like me to say to her ?' </p> <p> 'That it would be a remarkably good idea for her to insist on an abortion - even at this late stage. Saving that, she should wrench the fucking being out of her fucked-up womb and expose it, cast it on the fucking ground - that'd be just peachy.' Oh Christ - I've gone too far, she's backing off, turning, gathering her legs beneath her like stilts, piles under piles. She's moving away from me, fear and disgust curdling in her milky eyes. And that cowpat hat - my dear! </p> <p> 'You'd never have done it,' my lithopedion said, scampering between my own warped calves, as is its wont. </p> <p> 'I'm sorry?' I'd propped my brow against the plate glass of the patisserie, where cream cakes, croissants, Danishes and petits fours were massing with my strange thoughts. </p> <p> 'You'd never have done it - freaked out the old dead woman, Mrs Green.' My lithopedion was conceived and died in 1967, during the autumn of my love, which accounts for its hokey youthspeak. </p> <p> 'I forget that you know everything - have seen everything. I forget, I forget, I forget.' </p> <p> 'Not everything.' My lithopedion looked up at me with little, jet, periwinkle eyes. Mineral eyes. Its eyes have a black liveliness, so unlike its body, which is as grey as the York stone it stood upon. 'But everything that happened after my conception including those five minutes of conversation with Mrs Green at Embankment in October 1974 - I remember.' </p> <p> 'You're' - and to the passers-by I suppose this looked perfectly natural, an elderly woman leaning against the shop- front and muttering at her swollen ankles - 'a most sagacious lithopedion.' </p> <p> 'I'm your lithopedion -- your Lithy.' Sad that all my schooling paid off only in these, the last hours we spent together. But in the end Lithy did become the child I'd always wanted for myself, wise enough and sufficiently eloquent to re-parent me. </p> <p> 'Well, Lithy - and why wouldn't I?' </p> <p> For the first time in the eleven years we'd haunted each other, it stopped dancing and spoke clearly. 'Because once you'd got going you'd've felt compelled to fill in all the detail. You'd've conjured up a charmless picture of her own demise for the poor, dead soul. A Zimmer-frame expiration, hmm? The retort-stand upon which time has experimented with human mortality, that's the sort of observation you'd make - but far cruder. She got up, and on her way across the parlour to get more tea, stubbing the Axminster with the rubber stoppers, died there, before she could make it to the linoleum.' </p> <p> 'It has a certain dignity - put like that.' </p> <p> 'Put like that, but you - you'd embellish the description. She died on the Zimmer, pitched forward, so that her body dangled over the crossbar. You've always said that all English women - ' </p> <p> 'Of a certain age, a certain class - ' </p> <p> 'Are pear-shaped, and in death Mrs Green inverts this state; when, quickening with putrefaction, pullulating with drosophila grubs, head swollen with fluid, she becomes - for the first time in decades - the body of the pear, rather than its stalk.' </p> <p> 'Oh spare us this, Lithy, this pissy little guignol. Spare us, love - spare us. How about social services?' </p> <p> 'Social services - don't shake my tree, Mumsie, don't beat me Daddy-o ten to the bar - ' and Lithy broke off to do a little dance, which was far more in character. </p> <p> Lithy is a minuscule cadaver of a child - about half the size of a kewpie doll - who was misconceived, then died mislodged in the folds of my perineum. There it petrified for twenty-one years until I died in 1988. Then, with the first faltering steps I took after my death, it fell from under my nightie, and clattered on to the linoleum of the third-floor landing at the Royal Ear Hospital. Phar Lap Jones - who was removing me from my deathbed at the time - stopped, stooped and picked it up. 'See you here, girl,' he said in that cheek-clicking, palate-snapping, percussive take on the English language which I've never ever been able to take seriously. 'This is a lithopedion, little dead fossil baby of yours, yeh-hey!?' </p> <p> 'How would I know,' I replied; at that time death had yet to mellow me. </p> <p> \"Cos I lu-urve yoo!' warbled Lithy, who'd had twenty-one years to come up with a better line but whose material had been garnered mostly during the first few months it spent in the pink pleats, when the pop rhythms still resonated in my tautish belly. 'I just like the things yoo-doo / Wo-on't yooo- doo-the-things-yoo-doo / Nya-nya-nya-nya-nya-nya-nyaaa! / Nya-nya-nya-nya-nya-nya-nyaaa!' And, surprisingly nimble on its misshapen pins (in truth, little more than the stubs that confirmed it as the true inspiration for the rash of 'Mother Goddess' statues found on Neolithic sites), the lithopedion began as it has gone on ever since, weaving between my ankles, shaking its little tush. </p> <p> 'Could be worse y'know, girl,' said Phar Lap Jones. 'Much worse than the little feller. You never have no abortions, no?' </p> <p> 'No.' </p> <p> 'Stillbirths?' </p> <p> 'No.' </p> <p> 'Miscarriages?' </p> <p> 'Not that I'm aware of.' </p> <p> ''Cos they snag round yer head some - to begin with, hey-yeh?' </p> <p> 'What d'jew mean?' His face was hidden by the brim of his ridiculous, white dude Stetson. In the small shadows a hand- rolled cigarette smouldered. At that time it was only the absence of pain that allowed me to concentrate, although ever since I've had plenty of time to run over all of this crap again and again in my head. </p> <p> 'Dead foetuses, newborn babies, whatever. With mothers who have kids, y'know, and they're young then - little, right. Well, when that woman dies they come and hang around. But see, hey, if they're real small they're still attached to the woman, danglin' off her, see - like this smoke. Older kids - they don't hang around as much, grown-up kids not at all.' </p> <p> 'Like life?' </p> <p> 'No, not like life...' He paused, allowing some nurses to pass by, even though this was irrelevant. 'In life, death drive you 'part, yeh-hey? Now it drag you all t'gether. I wonder which you'll like better. Anyway, you had a dead child, right?' </p> <p> 'You know this?' It was an old distress to me, a neat ring- pull on my canned emotions. A hungry pain, that loss - like the cancer. </p> <p> 'What good's a bloke like me for your death guide if I don't know this stuff? No way to get you off the go-round without it, yeh-hey?' </p> <p> 'There was a son. David. He died when he was nine.' </p> <p> 'And that was back from where you came, your country, hey-yeh?' </p> <p> 'Vermont. Not my country, it was where we lived at the time.' </p> <p> 'Well, whatever, hey. It'll take the little-boy stuff time t'get here see? But then he'll bother you proper. Nine years is a bad age for a boy to die. They don't take it well, yeh-hey.' </p> <p> In 1988, on the dark landing, Phar Lap Jones spoke the truth while Lithy gambolled at my feet. Lithy never had any resentment or blamed me for its partial existence. Not so its brother Rude Boy - what else to call him? 'Dave' hardly seems suitable - who stowed away on a 747 and pitched up a few weeks later, while I was getting to know Dulston and attending the meetings. Rude Boy was there to remind me - for eleven long years - what it is to be a bad parent. Rude Boy is permanently arrested in the brattish mood of defiance that propelled him into the roadway, in front of the fifties fender which pulped his head then smeared it all over the asphalt. Now, in Old Compton Street, he's at it again. </p> <p> In 1957, in Vermont, I'd caught him, playing out in the yard with two of his buddies. The three boys, naked save for their shorts, were smeared all over with black mud they'd manufactured using the hosepipe. 'What're you playing?' I called to David from the back porch. 'The nigger game!' he shouted back. I burst through the screen door and was on him in two strides, grasped his blond hair, smacked his head once, twice, three times. He'd only said it by mistake - this much I knew even then, even in the first fog of anger. I knew also that what terrified me about these casually ejaculated globs of race hatred was that they must be my own. My own dark truffles of prejudice, swollen beneath the forest's floor. </p> <p> So, I smacked him and he ran and he got hit and he died. Now he likes to play in traffic whenever he can - and he's always blacked up for the nigger game. This evening, stood in the middle of Old Compton Street, still daubed with black New England mud, glistening on his straight, down-covered limbs, he shook his puny little fists at the illegal minicab drivers from Senegal, from Ghana, from Nigeria, and shouted at them, 'Niggers! Niggers! Niggers!' Not that they could hear him. They drove clear through him - like he was a will-o'-the- wisp bonnet mascot. Then he broke off and rounded on the cavalcade of clones. 'Pansies! Queers! Bum boys! Irons! Nonces!' he shrieked at them - and they too were oblivious. Hell, even if they could've seen him, what might they've thought? Nothing much. I've watched Rude Boy manifest himself tens of thousands of times in the decade we've been reunited - that's what the angry dead do; the rest of us are transparent with indifference, as invisible as the living. But much to his own disgust - and my weary amusement - hardly anyone in London seems capable of acknowledging the presence of a naked, mud-caked nine-year-old American boy screaming obscenities at them. In techie jargon - that argot of built-in obsolescence - they cannot compute. </p> <p> It's like the pimply plump blonde I saw on the concourse at Charing Cross Station the other morning. She was wearing a sweatshirt emblazoned 'Hard Rock Cafe - Kosovo'. Har-de- har. When my two girls were little I took them to the first proper hamburger joint in London, the Great American Disaster on the Fulham Road. In time this transformed itself into the Hard Rock Cafe, and after still more vicious circularity, disasters were manufactured to decorate their sweat-shirts. Cool, huh? </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/firstchapters/story/0,6761,338329,00.html\">How The Dead Live - part two</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Epilogue April 1999 We old women are easily erased from the picture of the last century. We're an entire demographic grouping of Trotskys. Like the once dapper Jew, we too stand with nonchalant unease at the base of that wooden pulpit, hastily erected on the platform of the Finland Station. Shorn of moustache and goatee our collective chin is rounded, awfully vulnerable, already anticipating the cold smack of the assassin's steel. Deprived of pince-nez our eyes are squinting into the limelight; what a mistake it was - we seem to be entreating future historians - to dress down for posterity. If only we'd kept our Trotsky costume on, not loaned our shoes to Lenin, then we wouldn't be facing this airbrushing out, this undeveloping, this eternal bloody deletion. Where, oh where are the old women of the twentieth century? Where have we all gone? So few films, photographs and television pictures include us. Even when we were featured, the real intention was to emphasise the props: see how old that coat is/bulky that sack is/worn out those shoes are. And next to the great men of the age we were merely mothers, or women-old-enough-to-be-their-mothers, or women whose age made us childlessness personified, as time turned tail and our old vaginas, like ancient vacuum cleaners, sucked up the unformed, the unbecome, the unborn. I'm not saying there haven't been exceptions, many many exceptions, crowds of exceptions like babushkas picking coal from the slag heap of the century. A legion of remarkable individuals humping hobo bundles down the road to where the einsatzgruppen were hard at it. Notable personalities grasping small, knobbly-haired heads between our withered dugs as the Interahamwe rampaged through the garden death-burbs of Kigali. Yes, we have been there. And I suppose, given our invisibility, our uselessness as anything but extras or crew - the gaffers, key grips and best boys of history - it's worth remarking that we were in fact there already. Yes, there before the director stopped shtupping his latest underage lover. There before the principals had any motivation, or the location had even been spotted. Like a herd of oblong-eyed goats, or a palisade of dead grass, or an enfilade of streetlamps, we were there. We old women - waiting for something to happen. And if there are drifts of old women blowing across the fields of the living, why be surprised that the same is true of the afterlife? You look at the cityscape and see us tottering about in our insupportable hosiery. Look again and realise that while many of us are clinging on to the ledge of life, many more have let go already. As the living grow older, a sterile wad of humanity blocking up the generative drain, so we, the dead, accumulate like pennies on the ledges of a cascade game. When the young die they're full of beans. Life hasn't exhausted them-why should death? Anyway, there are always vacancies in the provinces, or even abroad, for the morbidly mobile. Many young and middle-aged British dead work in the Gulf, the States, or even fucking Germany. But dead old women? Who wants us? In death as in life, we are the pavement-strollers, the window-shoppers, the bored, bunion-hobbled boulevardi\u00e8res. We're there waiting for something - anything - to happen. So we can be photographed, or filmed, or videoed, a backcloth of hysterectomies, in front of which events can be played out again, yet never exhausted. History is never in the round - it's always on a stage; and while the curtain may be death, why is it then that so many scrutinising eyes stud the proscenium, peering into the dimness of the stalls? Are they tragic or comedic masks - or not masks at all? Earlier this evening - if this still is evening, we've waited so bloody long - I, Lily Bloom, picked my way down Old Compton Street. Yet another dead old woman patrolling the West End on a misconceived mission. My lithopedion scampered between my ankles, my Rude Boy was prancing in the road. Ahead of us the snake-hipped figure of Phar Lap Jones moved in and out of the gay throng. He may be old, but he's black, he's slim and - of course - he's a karadji, a mekigar, a wizard. Full of buginja power, possessed of miwi magic. With his finely corrugated matt skin and his thriving restaurant business, he might, it's often occurred to me, be the ultimate leather queen. When I was alive I made it my business to zero in on my fellow biddies. Given a street scene like this - full of young people hurling themselves into the puppetry of lust, tying rubbery abandonment to their ankles and wrists before bungee jumping into orgasm - I'd've been taken by the tweed-wearers, the bearers of the capacious gusset and the porters of the nylon bag. The granny guild. I'd strike up conversations with these widows, spinsters and bints. I suppose I saw myself as a kind of reporter, researching a long article on the world, which turned out to be a profile of myself. I'd interview these old women, interrogate them as to who they were, what they were doing, where they were going, why they fucking bothered, and when they'd give it up. Later, I'd write their replies down in a notebook: 1. A Mrs Green, the widow of a minor civil servant. She lives in Hornsey in the house she owned with her husband, in a basement flat knocked out by the son and daughter-in-law who cannot wait to inherit. 2. She's going to the Old Bailey to sit in the public gallery. It's good, cheap, wholesome fun. 3. Her basement is hot in summer, cool in the winter; it's good to get out. 4. It's not a question that can be answered at her age. She understands that life is not so much a journey from one horizon to the next as a survey of the world all around. How wrong you were, Mrs Green.

Lithy is a minuscule cadaver of a child - about half the size of a kewpie doll - who was misconceived, then died mislodged in the folds of my perineum. There it petrified for twenty-one years until I died in 1988. Then, with the first faltering steps I took after my death, it fell from under my nightie, and clattered on to the linoleum of the third-floor landing at the Royal Ear Hospital. Phar Lap Jones - who was removing me from my deathbed at the time - stopped, stooped and picked it up. 'See you here, girl,' he said in that cheek-clicking, palate-snapping, percussive take on the English language which I've never ever been able to take seriously. 'This is a lithopedion, little dead fossil baby of yours, yeh-hey!?' 'How would I know,' I replied; at that time death had yet to mellow me. \"Cos I lu-urve yoo!' warbled Lithy, who'd had twenty-one years to come up with a better line but whose material had been garnered mostly during the first few months it spent in the pink pleats, when the pop rhythms still resonated in my tautish belly. 'I just like the things yoo-doo / Wo-on't yooo- doo-the-things-yoo-doo / Nya-nya-nya-nya-nya-nya-nyaaa! / Nya-nya-nya-nya-nya-nya-nyaaa!' And, surprisingly nimble on its misshapen pins (in truth, little more than the stubs that confirmed it as the true inspiration for the rash of 'Mother Goddess' statues found on Neolithic sites), the lithopedion began as it has gone on ever since, weaving between my ankles, shaking its little tush. 'Could be worse y'know, girl,' said Phar Lap Jones. 'Much worse than the little feller. You never have no abortions, no?' 'No.' 'Stillbirths?' 'No.' 'Miscarriages?' 'Not that I'm aware of.' ''Cos they snag round yer head some - to begin with, hey-yeh?' 'What d'jew mean?' His face was hidden by the brim of his ridiculous, white dude Stetson. In the small shadows a hand- rolled cigarette smouldered. At that time it was only the absence of pain that allowed me to concentrate, although ever since I've had plenty of time to run over all of this crap again and again in my head. 'Dead foetuses, newborn babies, whatever. With mothers who have kids, y'know, and they're young then - little, right. Well, when that woman dies they come and hang around. But see, hey, if they're real small they're still attached to the woman, danglin' off her, see - like this smoke. Older kids - they don't hang around as much, grown-up kids not at all.' 'Like life?' 'No, not like life...' He paused, allowing some nurses to pass by, even though this was irrelevant. 'In life, death drive you 'part, yeh-hey? Now it drag you all t'gether. I wonder which you'll like better. Anyway, you had a dead child, right?' 'You know this?' It was an old distress to me, a neat ring- pull on my canned emotions. A hungry pain, that loss - like the cancer. 'What good's a bloke like me for your death guide if I don't know this stuff? No way to get you off the go-round without it, yeh-hey?' 'There was a son. David. He died when he was nine.' 'And that was back from where you came, your country, hey-yeh?' 'Vermont. Not my country, it was where we lived at the time.' 'Well, whatever, hey. It'll take the little-boy stuff time t'get here see? But then he'll bother you proper. Nine years is a bad age for a boy to die. They don't take it well, yeh-hey.' In 1988, on the dark landing, Phar Lap Jones spoke the truth while Lithy gambolled at my feet. Lithy never had any resentment or blamed me for its partial existence. Not so its brother Rude Boy - what else to call him? 'Dave' hardly seems suitable - who stowed away on a 747 and pitched up a few weeks later, while I was getting to know Dulston and attending the meetings. Rude Boy was there to remind me - for eleven long years - what it is to be a bad parent. Rude Boy is permanently arrested in the brattish mood of defiance that propelled him into the roadway, in front of the fifties fender which pulped his head then smeared it all over the asphalt. Now, in Old Compton Street, he's at it again. In 1957, in Vermont, I'd caught him, playing out in the yard with two of his buddies. The three boys, naked save for their shorts, were smeared all over with black mud they'd manufactured using the hosepipe. 'What're you playing?' I called to David from the back porch. 'The nigger game!' he shouted back. I burst through the screen door and was on him in two strides, grasped his blond hair, smacked his head once, twice, three times. He'd only said it by mistake - this much I knew even then, even in the first fog of anger. I knew also that what terrified me about these casually ejaculated globs of race hatred was that they must be my own. My own dark truffles of prejudice, swollen beneath the forest's floor. So, I smacked him and he ran and he got hit and he died. Now he likes to play in traffic whenever he can - and he's always blacked up for the nigger game. This evening, stood in the middle of Old Compton Street, still daubed with black New England mud, glistening on his straight, down-covered limbs, he shook his puny little fists at the illegal minicab drivers from Senegal, from Ghana, from Nigeria, and shouted at them, 'Niggers! Niggers! Niggers!' Not that they could hear him. They drove clear through him - like he was a will-o'-the- wisp bonnet mascot. Then he broke off and rounded on the cavalcade of clones. 'Pansies! Queers! Bum boys! Irons! Nonces!' he shrieked at them - and they too were oblivious. Hell, even if they could've seen him, what might they've thought? Nothing much. I've watched Rude Boy manifest himself tens of thousands of times in the decade we've been reunited - that's what the angry dead do; the rest of us are transparent with indifference, as invisible as the living. But much to his own disgust - and my weary amusement - hardly anyone in London seems capable of acknowledging the presence of a naked, mud-caked nine-year-old American boy screaming obscenities at them. In techie jargon - that argot of built-in obsolescence - they cannot compute. It's like the pimply plump blonde I saw on the concourse at Charing Cross Station the other morning. She was wearing a sweatshirt emblazoned 'Hard Rock Cafe - Kosovo'. Har-de- har. When my two girls were little I took them to the first proper hamburger joint in London, the Great American Disaster on the Fulham Road. In time this transformed itself into the Hard Rock Cafe, and after still more vicious circularity, disasters were manufactured to decorate their sweat-shirts. Cool, huh?

      "body": "<p>Oh, that Rude Boy! All he's learned in the eleven years he's spent in England is a plethora of pejoratives. No trips to the Wigmore Hall to hear Beethoven string quartets for him. No expeditions up Piccadilly to buy Burberry. No wry browsing along the Bayswater Road on a Sunday afternoon, laughing at the kitsch dangling from the park railings. No-no. What that foul-mouthed kid likes is to do what he did then, run up behind me and plant one of his trowel feet - shaped like, as hard as - right in my fundament. </p> <p> 'Yah!' he screamed. 'Fuck you, you bitch! Fuck you!' The living may not feel or recognise or acknowledge the presence of the dead, but we can get to each other, as you know, when we're not expecting the intrusion. Rude Boy's foot usually passes right through me, but I was caught unawares - his sharp contempt lanced into my stupid, colourless indifference, and I turned to see his bony, mud-spattered little figure weaving away through the crowd. Having children may have been the whole point of life, but what it adds to death is dubious. </p> <p> 'Rude Boy, yeh-hey!' Phar Lap had backtracked to find out what was delaying me. 'He never stops ridin' you, hey-yeh?' </p> <p> 'No, I guess not.' We stopped. He rolled a cigarette, I got one out. We lit them. </p> <p> 'Mebbe it's time to tell 'im goodbye, move on, hey-yeh?' Phar Lap held his hand so it cupped my elbow and I turned to accompany him. Both of us pretended to touch. </p> <p> 'I daresay that's true - but can I?' </p> <p> 'Yeh-hey. It's not all gammin, y'know.' </p> <p> 'What? Reincarnation?' </p> <p> 'Yaka! Not a good word, that; iss like callin' sickies who fuck with kiddies \"child-lovers\", hey? No-no, y'see - you know this Lily stuff, we not gonna put it in a new body, yeh- hey? They don't make one body serve two souls, or one soul serve two bodies. Cleverer than that. You used t' think that you were your body - not so.' 'Not so.' </p> <p> 'No, what makes you Lily now? This lithopedion? This here cheeky one? Phar Lap has a way of gesturing all his own, elbows held tight by his serpentine sides, forearms angled out like the indicators on my father's c. 1927 Hupmobile. When he does this it's impossible not to pay attention - he commands attention. </p> <p> We made it to the block after Patisserie Valerie, Rude Boy was in the roadway and Lithy lost in the velveteen folds of my sensible sack dress, when the entire frontage of the pub we were passing shivered, undulated and was then punched from within by an explosion. The matter percolated into the air like milk mushrooming into coffee. Coasters, bar mats, handles, straights, queers, the artworks formerly known as prints, stools, trousers, carousers, hearts, lungs, lights, blood, viscera, Britvic, gelignite, Babycham, carpet tiling, dry-roasted peanuts, penises - the entire gubbins of the bar gathered into a fisted force field and splurged into the street. I felt the afflatus of several souls stream through what might've been me, what might've been Phar Lap. Tatters of people. The blast curled around us, crinkling up the envelope of air as if it were paper. </p> <p> Then everyone in Old Compton Street was lying down - as if a malevolent god had announced a nap-time for all the children. The only individual standing was Rude Boy. 'Faggots! Niggers!' he screamed. Lithy, stunned, clung to my ankle, and dangled there hitching a lift as we skirted through shattered glass - which as ever looked disassembled to me, a window jigsaw - and shards of wood; and the children, who now stirred, shuddering into shock; and the bystanders who unglued themselves from Pompeii poses; and the bits of the people. Goodnight mush. </p> <p> Phar Lap clicked into my inner ear, 'Diddit with the punishment boomerang, hey. Walbiri one, hey-yeh. Very strong. Dragged it clear across the Balkans on my way back this time. Kickin' up bi-ig death dust for this year, hey-yeh!' </p> <p> 'Bullshit,' was my snappy rejoinder. We slowed to turn the corner into Wardour Street, swerving to avoid a dead old prostitute coming the other way. I recognised her; she has so many foetuses floating around her head - each tethered by its own serpentine umbilicus - that among the locally deceased she's known as Medusa. I went on disabusing Phar Lap: 'It's a fact written about in the press that this is the work of some far-right cell - an offshoot of the BNP, whatever.' </p> <p> 'Yuwai - it's speculated about. It's a fact that we're late - yeh-hey?' </p> <p> Again he accelerated through the crowd ahead of me, a crowd which, as we strolled beyond its psychic shockwave, was exhibiting in reverse all the symptoms induced by the explosion. Sure, there were the emergency sirens' synthesised whoops - but aren't there always? And the pumped-up people seeking the violence anywhere but within themselves - but aren't there all the time? No, the bomb in Old Compton Street was a car crash and we hadn't stopped to gawk. Under the fake-porphyry columns of the NatWest bank, Rude Boy was waggling his little dick in the unaware face of a Dutch tourist who was having her cheese-head cheesily portrayed by an Ethiopian economic migrant. Lithy shinnied up, arm over arm, to grab the bottom bead of my amber necklace, and pulled itself into the shelter of my bosom. </p> <p> How strange it is never really to be able to touch another. During the sixties I always wondered at those astronauts, not being able adequately to describe what it was like to be weightless. I figured that maybe they sent really stupid people into space, but over the last eleven years I've learned that some sensations are like that. When you're dead you can hold yourself against a thing, you can rub up and down, intent upon the precise degree of resistance the surface presents, but you won't feel it; it doesn't touch you. Still, we all do it - this pretence of touching one another. It seems to come naturally enough - wouldn't you agree? - when you're dead. </p> <p> I've never altogether missed that aspect of life - the physical aspect, the insidey-outsidey part of it. I didn't even have a dead little twin to meet on the other side - like so many do. The idiot twin in my life was that big blonde slab-body I shlepped around with me, all heavy and stupid and inert and smiling thickly, for my entire fucking adult life. And then the cancer yet! I had a ridiculously late menopause for a woman so obviously past it. Fancy that - hardly had I given a final flush to the bloody cistern of menstruation when the alarm went off somewhere and the cells began to divide. </p> <p> Some wiseacre told me - when I was actually fucking dying - that a foetus undergoes far more rapid cell division during ontogeny than any cancer. Great. He died three years after me - cancer too - and at that time I was still naive enough to imagine that what the afterlife chiefly provided were unrivalled opportunities for unbeatable gloating, unbelievable schadenfreude. So English, that - a nation who've always been convulsed by the world's pratfall, when it was they who yanked away the chair. So, anyway, I went and had a look, maybe manifested myself a little - I don't remember - but I tried to make his death a misery, whispering, 'Dividing-dividing-dividing...' in his ear. Who knows. Who knows. </p> <p> In Piccadilly there were unquiet spirits aplenty, the futile shades of dead junkies and drabs and auto-accident victims, who make it their business to whirl distractedly around Eros's standard. I'd like to see the seance that could get in touch with this roundabout of loons. I tell you I wouldn't even have noticed this crappy cavalcade had it not been for Rude Boy, who always insists on joining in, ripping the ectoplasm from their shoulders, flinging it into the air like he was a pizza chef. I shouted at him to come on, and Lithy piped up as well, 'Come on-comeon-Come on-comeon! D'you wanna be in my gang, my gang, my gang, d'you wanna be in my gang - oh yeah!' And this did bring Rude Boy over, but only to cuff Lithy, who screeched and appealed to me, but I shoved it off and it kicked at Rude Boy and Rude Boy kicked out again. As ever it was difficult to tell what infuriated them more, their own hated consanguinity or their inability ever actually to land a blow, one on the other. So, they followed me on down through Piccadilly bickering and sniping and contradicting each other. Kids, huh. </p> <p> Yeah, the unceasing awareness of underwear - I don't miss it. I remember being in Tuscany, in the mid-seventies, and all I could focus on in a beautiful Renaissance palazzo I visited, the only fucking thing in room after room of paintings and furniture and glass and Christ knows what, was a door-lock which resembled a bra-hook - flat eyes. The only thing I could hang on to all that hot, scented, beautifully touchy-feely afternoon. Must've been 'cause I had diarrhoea. It used to do that to me - crank up the unceasing underwear-awareness. Obviously. </p> <p> Standing underneath Eros, I hoped the deatheaucracy had rented somewhere special for this meeting, because I wanted it to be a special meeting. I'd spent yonks dragging around their offices in Eltham, Ongar, Barking and Thurrock. You're familiar with the premises they favour, leased with the evidence of failed businesses still stacked about: Nobbo peg-boards, Sasco year planners, redundant Roladexes, outmoded computing equipment. Yeah, this is the kind of swinging scene the deatheaucracy favours. Indeed, it's difficult - wouldn'tjew say - to see them in any other context, ratty little men in brown suits that they are. Just as it's impossible to imagine them not twiddling with their computer-games consoles, or fiddling with their Gameboys. Why can it be that the people who run death have such a reliable appetite for gadgets, fads, crazes - anything, in fact, that will allow them the opportunity to fidget for hour after hour, while the traffic clots in the arteries outside, and we shades gather among the shadows in the waiting room. </p> <p> Still, as you know, not all the people who run death are male; there's the odd woman as well. And very odd they are too, these eternally plain Janes. They're the kind of spinsters who came of age immediately after both wars - women existing within the vacuum of a permanently absented pur\u00e9e of masculinity. Beneath umbrellas of cashmere and cotton they scampered away their lives, eluding the damp mizzle of testosterone. Now they're doing the same in death. Icky! Phar Lap says that most of these secretarial spinnies are unquiet spirits. But I protest that there's nothing quieter than these desiccated women, who tiptoe into meetings, only to deposit another buff folder into the tatty fingers of Mr Glanville, Mr Hartly, or Mr Canter - the mister who's given my application the most consideration over the years. </p> <p> 'You've set your heart on rebirth, then?' Mr Canter said at one of our last encounters, his fingers steepled over the graveyard of an open file. </p> <p> 'Yes, I think death has taught me all that it might.' I had my knees drawn together, my hands clasped in my lap. I clenched my fists and - hey presto! A half-century sloughed off and I was back in the unsuccessful interviews at Barnard and Wellesley, where they looked at my prominent nose from all kinds of angles. </p> <p> 'Oh really.' Canter was wearing his habitual, primitive, Norfolk-cut, Jaeger wool suit. I recognised it from the off as one of George Bernard Shaw's purpose-built garments, and pegged the deatheaucrat accordingly as a Shavian pacifist and freethinker of the Edwardian period. To begin with I was amused to see the people who run death sustaining their crankiness way past the grave - but perhaps it's only the English who do this? </p> <p> I've always suspected that death American-style would've been both glitzier and more convivial. That Bobby Franks would've waited the twelve years for Loeb to turn up, so that the two of them could be pals, play pinochle and wait for Leopold to come from South America. That even a pair like that would eventually knuckle under to the defeat of the will. </p> <p> It's a fact that you need a good background in bureaucracy to run death. I tested for a job with them a couple of years after I died, but, free of arthritis or not, I was told that my typing was too slow, my filing too haphazard. (Although there was general enthusiasm for me among the staff of the office where I was interviewed, when they heard about my background in pen design.) </p> <p> Beyond this I don't believe there's any especial qualification, d'jew? After all, most of the deathly offices are hung with suits from all the decades of the last two hundred years or so. I've seen sharp 1950s sharkskin single-breasters, and tough 1930s twill sacks; 1890s nankeen frock coats and 1870s sawtooth cutaways. But mostly, the hideous brown-and- chalk-stripe double-breasteds of the 1940s predominate, I guess because this was when the bureaucratic type came to the fore - and we all went for a Burton. Left in charge by their more belligerent brothers, the paper-pilers and pen-pushers remained in the rear, both armies of non-combatants speaking ACRONYM, and perfecting the office management systems that would come to dominate the post-war world. Alan Turing was the originator of the spreadsheet, in case you didn't realise. </p> <p> 'Oh really.' Canter said it again and I savour it anew. There are some good things about death as well as many bad ones. The good things include the time to sit and stare. There's no hurry. In between the 'Oh' and the 'really' I had plenty of time to examine chipped chipboard partitions and dense slabs of MDF. Time to see that in this office - above a dry-cleaner's premises on Willesden High Road - the Dexion cradle within which Canter's department carts around its nyujo occupies a dominant position. Canter and his staff have always loved telling me, 'Oh, you know, it's a very fine nyujo, a very perspicacious one - we do so like to keep it with us.' </p> <p> D'jew know the nyujo? It's the petrified corpse of a long-gone scrivener, who saw fit to meditate himself into a crystalline state. The one belonging to this department achieved this by ceaselessly revolving on his Parker Knoll beneath an interminable succession of plastic demijohns of Buxton mineral water, upended by his disciples and set, one after the other, atop his Dexion cubicle. From time to time small basins of Tipp-Ex were thrown over his bowed head, staples fired at him from acolytes' guns, labels of all sorts affixed - Post-it notes ditto. Over the years this figurehead has swollen to alarming proportions - a dumpy Buddha, encrusted with stationery. Yet still he's humped from one defunct travel agency to the next busted electrical wholesaler's in his papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 palanquin. </p> <p> I expect you've discovered they're immensely proud of their statue of Anubis too? Pathetic isn't it, the way they drag it around whichever block it is that they're currently tenanting, as if it were a recalcitrant old pampered doggie. Still, I suppose it is. </p> <p> The living, I guess, would expect the coincidence of different eras of suiting, and the presence of Cratchit clerks playing Nintendo, to give these offices an anachronistic air. We know it's not so. It's always the dumb mistake of the living to imagine themselves contemporary. 'Every period I've lived through has seemed like now to me,' my second husband was fond of saying - fondness was his forte. He was no more fond of me or his daughters or his mother than he was of his dog, or his golf bag, or his penis. Fondness was inscribed on his heart when I cut it out still beating. Only kidding. </p> <p> Yaws kept prodigiously exact records of the Now during his entire lifetime, detailing every little particle of its extinction. When, after his own, I came to read them, they proved to my entire satisfaction that the over-examined life is hardly worth living; and that while ostensibly he had died of a routine cardiac infarction, he had in fact, like so many of his ilk - permanently adolescent, upper-middle-class, minor-public-school-educated Englishmen - strolled back to the Elysian pavilion, his entry in the scorebook marked 'Retired bored'. </p> <p> 'Oh really?' Had Canter said it yet again? He'd definitely caught me eyeing the fucking nyujo, because he continued, 'You hadn't perhaps considered becoming a nyujo yourself?' </p> <p> 'I'm sorry?' I replied - although I'd heard him only too clearly. </p> <p> 'Liberation through hearing on the after-death plane - you're familiar with it of course?' </p> <p> 'Of course.' They always talk like this, don't they, the brown suits, the deatheaucrats, effortlessly rendering the transcendent banal. 'But I'd rather set my heart on living again.' </p> <p> 'We've got all sorts of new animating principles available, you know - flesh harvests of anencephalic stillborn infants coming through all the time-' He broke off to address a passing clerk: 'Mr Davis? You wouldn't be so kind as to bring over the Roladex with the anencephalic stillborn infants' animating principles on it, would you?' </p> <p> 'Truly, I have no desire to be nyujo, and I'd rather counted on being me on the next go-round, as it were.' </p> <p> 'You appreciate that you'll actually be more you if you accept a new animating principle, hmm? There'll be a more ... how can I put it? ... porous barrier between your assemblages of memories.' </p> <p> 'I know this, yes - but I won't be me. Me. Me.' </p> <p> 'Quite so.' </p> <p> Yes, I kid you not - this is the kind of dreck he tried to palm me off with. Still, at least I wasn't among the living, stumbling about the joint imagining themselves painted up with the present, when it ain't necessarily so. Their minds are full of dead ideas, images and distorted facts. Their visual field is cluttered up with decaying buildings, rusting cars, potholed roads and an imperfectly realised sky, which darkens towards the horizon of history. They take in all ages in the one frame every time they snap the city with their Brownie brainboxes. Their very noses are clogged with dying hairs, moribund skin, stratified snot - they're smelling the past; and feeling it too - between their toes, their thighs, the pits of their arms: ssshk- shk! Peeling back the years. Whereas we, the dead, are the true inheritors of the Modern. The live lot assemble time into lazy decadences - ten-year periods of conspicuous attitudinising, which are only ever grasped in nostalgic retrospect. My second husband was a profoundly ancient man, a Neolithic stone- knapper. But we... we see it all; anachro-spectacles are the only ones we wear. So these interminable branch offices that I've revolved through, while Lithy sat in my lap and Rude Boy ranted in the vestibule, trying to piss on back numbers of the Reader's Digest, haven't been so strange, or so different. </p> <p> Anyway, I'm getting off the point, which Canter never has. 'Thank you, Mr Davis,' he said, taking receipt of the relevant buff folder. 'You see, Ms Bloom - or rather your death guide... Mr... Jones, ye-es Jones, may have told you - we have our own calculus here, our own ways of proceeding?' 'I'm only too well aware.' </p> <p> 'This isn't' - then he really did take off his wire-rimmed spectacles, and run his hand through his sparse, sandy hair, giving me time to appreciate, once again, that instead of being determined by the magisterially pompous English gentile who I'd thought was going to decide it, my fate was in the waxy paws of a ratty little Jew - 'any longer a matter of how you conducted yourself on your last \"go-round\", as you put it.' </p> <p> 'Mr Canter, sir' - such honorifics came naturally when I was addressing someone who hadn't taken a shit since 1953 - 'I'm only too well aware of the implications of karma.' </p> <p> 'On the before-death plane perhaps - but after death? You died, in 1988, owing over two thousand pounds to the Inland Revenue. Monies which had, subsequently, to be disbursed by your estate - ' </p> <p> 'Is this strictly relevant?' </p> <p> 'Oh yes, accounts are accounts - and we are - ' Accountants. Save for his peculiar colleagues, Mr Canter is well-nigh indistinguishable from Mr Weintraub, who, when I saw him for the last time - the cancer scooping out my left boob as if it were a fucking avocado - assured me he'd take care of the relevant returns... sitting in his aggressively Artexed office, off the North Circular by Brent Cross, playing with a Bic Cristal and annotating the accounts I myself had laboriously put together. </p> <p> ' - concerned here with totting up all the relevant columns. We'll be doing this for most of the next year, so don't be alarmed if your neighbours - you live in Dulburb?' </p> <p> 'Dulston,' I grunted. </p> <p> 'Dulston, quite so, a lovely area, very much village London. Anyway, if you should hear that certain enquiries are being made about you, rest assured that it's only us. And now,' he screwed his doughy butt into the swivel chair as if he were intent on sodomy, 'there's the matter of sex.' 'Sex?' </p> <p> 'Indeed, you will not, I hope, find yourself too discomfited by a resumption in sexual feelings, hmm? Merely psychic to begin with, but very real for all that.' He paused for effect and a zombie brought in tea and Nice biscuits. </p> <p> Mr Canter and I sat either side of them for the remainder of the interview. After I'd left, another zombie returned to take them away. Funny how we dead never eat - yet still, some of us love to serve food. </p> <p>Well, that was one of the last encounters with Canter, as I say. And earlier this evening, in Piccadilly now, I was beset by a liquefying inundation of orgasms - of dicks stirring me up. When I was abandoned in the wastes of late middle age, my flesh folding, then frowning into sour slackness, I wanted my sex cut out - and so it was; in death, at least. Who cut the cookie with the cookie cutter? But ever since Miles and Natasha got down to it in the gauche apartment on Regent's Park Road, I've been tormented by lust and jealousy. Who'd ever have thought they'd be welcome again in this old house, behind this envious green door? Ethereal fingers prinking my pussy. My first husband, jolly Dave Kaplan, he used to say that his beard was like 'wearing a pussy on my face - I've only got to stroke my chin and I feel real comfy'. It's Dave I thought of in, Piccadilly. Or rather, it was the incongruous liver spot, adrift in his sparse hairline, that I pictured. It was always this scrap of yellow-brown I focused on as I willed myself towards another orgasm of crushing non-spontaneity. </p> <p> Years after the marriage was over - the late sixties to be vaguely precise - when we'd occasionally meet in Manhattan for lunch - those good, wholesome divorcees' lunches, the only ones people who've been sexually involved can have and still enjoy their food - he divulged that while I was looking at his liver spot and imagining myself ecstatic, he was concentrating hard on the mole on my chin, while willing himself to detumesce. 'Touche pas!' I laughed, and raised my glass of Zinfandel. 'Yes,' he continued, 'I've spent possibly years of my life entirely absorbed in the pimples, blemishes and other imperfections of beautiful women.' And as if called to stimulate himself by this revelation, he meditatively stroked his pussy. </p> <p> Spontaneous or not, I did use to orgasm with Kaplan. I did clutch his arched neck, groan, say things - I did that crap. I loved sex - or rather, like so many women of my era, I loved the idea of sex. Sex garbed in romantic weeds, sex with strong self-assured men rather than puling boychicks. Set against imaginings like these the real thing was never that great, natch; the dildo would have to be dressed. I knew even then, from talking to the boychicks themselves (and was there ever a century like the twentieth for chewing things over; 'Time as a Cud' - discuss), that their chief sexual hang-up was the reverse of mine - a hang-down, if you like. For all these guys sex was too sexy. That's why Dave confined himself to the mole. </p> <p> We'd gone a couple more blocks and I couldn't see Phar Lap Jones ahead of me, when 'Oimissus!' - there he was, sitting, back against the wall, beside one of the alleyways that leads into the Albany. With the brim of his white Stetson pulled down low, he wasn't much more than black jeans, bullroarer and outsize punishment boomerangs. He looked just like any of the other alien sophomores who've enrolled for this year's London Summer School of the Didgeridoo. 'Oi!' He'd managed to mooch a meat pie from somewhere along the way. Strange, this being Kebabistan, rather than Fish-and-Chiplington. He chews up these hassocks of mince and onion after he's skin-popped them with brown sauce. It's a newly-coined Strine tradition of his. Meat-pie dreaming - I guess. But he never swallows it, none of us does, do we. </p> <p> Anyway, as I say, there he was in the alleyway and I felt this aching desire to get in there with him, to cram myself inside that gully of old bricks. I was half-convinced that for the first time in eleven years I'd get some abrasion, some rasp - between Phar Lap and the wall, that is. I may even have begun insinuating myself, because he said, 'Juda! Lily, not in there, girl, that's bad, you can't go in there.' 'Where? The Albany?' </p> <p> 'No, that fuckin' buju, girl!' He made as if to pull me along with him and I followed in his wake, the two of us breasting the summertime crowds, who had now, like brown rats, sensed the explosion five blocks away by mood transmission. It made them all look as ugly as they are for a change. 'You feel that, didya?' he said. </p> <p> 'What's that?' </p> <p> 'No more of yer stupid colourlessness of indifference, hey-yeh?' </p> <p> 'No, I really wanted to get in that alleyway - ' </p> <p> 'With me, yuwai, an' you been thinkin' 'bout rootin' long time now, yeh-hey?' 'Ye-es.' </p> <p> 'You've bin dead too long, girl, dead too long. Those dead souls on Old Compton Street, they passed clean through and you never broke step. I saw that.' </p> <p> 'So you - you do think rebirth would be a good idea... in my case?' </p> <p> He stopped again, this time right next to a woman who was squinting into the air, arm outstretched, as if hailing a cab driven by Zeus across the fiery evening sky. Phar Lap was so close to her that he damped himself down a little - and so did I. We whittled our presences away. That's what we dead do, isn't it? Shave ourselves out of the designer-stubbled faces of the living. Rude Boy came and sat on the kerb by us. Lithy, amazingly, leant against Rude Boy's knee. 'Is it that you wanna get shot of these fellers, yeh-hey?' </p> <p> 'No! I mean - maybe. I don't know. But if I am reborn I've children to talk to among the living - even if I leave these two behind.' </p> <p> 'Yeh-hey! You don't wanna be alone ever, d'you Lily?' </p> <p> 'Do you?' </p> <p> 'I never am. Listen, don' go crawlin' into no cracks, not now. You hold back on those wantin' feelings you're gettin', yeh? You do bad shit now and you're done for girl, see? It'll come back at you like this here kayan - see?' He waved his big, black boomerang to bludgeon home his point. 'Now snap it up - Mr Canter is waitin' for you.' </p> <p> He lifted his arm up in front of the vacant eyes of the living woman and grabbed the cab. That's how I ended up here with you. Stuck here in the waiting room, anticipating my final encounter with the deatheaucracy - for the time being. </p> <p><strong>Christmas 2001 </strong></p> <p>Yeah, but there was more, hindsight multiplying me like opposing mirrors set either side of a restaurant booth. Because as we boarded the cab I remembered. This rush across this West End, ignoring the bombing in Old Compton Street, forcing Rude Boy to keep the pace: we were in a hurry - I was in a hurry. Now, that's one thing you never do when you're dead. There's no rush when you're dead. You may have scrambled up the dark stairs to confront it, nose to the musty carpet, anticipating its horror for every one of those fifteen steps, expecting it every inch of the half-landing. But there's no rushing once you've seen him, her and it. No rushing once you're there. Only pottering around. Pottering around for eternity.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Oh, that Rude Boy! All he's learned in the eleven years he's spent in England is a plethora of pejoratives. No trips to the Wigmore Hall to hear Beethoven string quartets for him. No expeditions up Piccadilly to buy Burberry. No wry browsing along the Bayswater Road on a Sunday afternoon, laughing at the kitsch dangling from the park railings. No-no. What that foul-mouthed kid likes is to do what he did then, run up behind me and plant one of his trowel feet - shaped like, as hard as - right in my fundament. 'Yah!' he screamed. 'Fuck you, you bitch! Fuck you!' The living may not feel or recognise or acknowledge the presence of the dead, but we can get to each other, as you know, when we're not expecting the intrusion. Rude Boy's foot usually passes right through me, but I was caught unawares - his sharp contempt lanced into my stupid, colourless indifference, and I turned to see his bony, mud-spattered little figure weaving away through the crowd. Having children may have been the whole point of life, but what it adds to death is dubious. 'Rude Boy, yeh-hey!' Phar Lap had backtracked to find out what was delaying me. 'He never stops ridin' you, hey-yeh?' 'No, I guess not.' We stopped. He rolled a cigarette, I got one out. We lit them. 'Mebbe it's time to tell 'im goodbye, move on, hey-yeh?' Phar Lap held his hand so it cupped my elbow and I turned to accompany him. Both of us pretended to touch. 'I daresay that's true - but can I?' 'Yeh-hey. It's not all gammin, y'know.' 'What? Reincarnation?' 'Yaka! Not a good word, that; iss like callin' sickies who fuck with kiddies \"child-lovers\", hey? No-no, y'see - you know this Lily stuff, we not gonna put it in a new body, yeh- hey? They don't make one body serve two souls, or one soul serve two bodies. Cleverer than that. You used t' think that you were your body - not so.' 'Not so.' 'No, what makes you Lily now? This lithopedion? This here cheeky one? Phar Lap has a way of gesturing all his own, elbows held tight by his serpentine sides, forearms angled out like the indicators on my father's c. 1927 Hupmobile. When he does this it's impossible not to pay attention - he commands attention. We made it to the block after Patisserie Valerie, Rude Boy was in the roadway and Lithy lost in the velveteen folds of my sensible sack dress, when the entire frontage of the pub we were passing shivered, undulated and was then punched from within by an explosion. The matter percolated into the air like milk mushrooming into coffee. Coasters, bar mats, handles, straights, queers, the artworks formerly known as prints, stools, trousers, carousers, hearts, lungs, lights, blood, viscera, Britvic, gelignite, Babycham, carpet tiling, dry-roasted peanuts, penises - the entire gubbins of the bar gathered into a fisted force field and splurged into the street. I felt the afflatus of several souls stream through what might've been me, what might've been Phar Lap. Tatters of people. The blast curled around us, crinkling up the envelope of air as if it were paper. Then everyone in Old Compton Street was lying down - as if a malevolent god had announced a nap-time for all the children. The only individual standing was Rude Boy. 'Faggots! Niggers!' he screamed. Lithy, stunned, clung to my ankle, and dangled there hitching a lift as we skirted through shattered glass - which as ever looked disassembled to me, a window jigsaw - and shards of wood; and the children, who now stirred, shuddering into shock; and the bystanders who unglued themselves from Pompeii poses; and the bits of the people. Goodnight mush. Phar Lap clicked into my inner ear, 'Diddit with the punishment boomerang, hey. Walbiri one, hey-yeh. Very strong. Dragged it clear across the Balkans on my way back this time. Kickin' up bi-ig death dust for this year, hey-yeh!' 'Bullshit,' was my snappy rejoinder. We slowed to turn the corner into Wardour Street, swerving to avoid a dead old prostitute coming the other way. I recognised her; she has so many foetuses floating around her head - each tethered by its own serpentine umbilicus - that among the locally deceased she's known as Medusa. I went on disabusing Phar Lap: 'It's a fact written about in the press that this is the work of some far-right cell - an offshoot of the BNP, whatever.' 'Yuwai - it's speculated about. It's a fact that we're late - yeh-hey?' Again he accelerated through the crowd ahead of me, a crowd which, as we strolled beyond its psychic shockwave, was exhibiting in reverse all the symptoms induced by the explosion. Sure, there were the emergency sirens' synthesised whoops - but aren't there always? And the pumped-up people seeking the violence anywhere but within themselves - but aren't there all the time? No, the bomb in Old Compton Street was a car crash and we hadn't stopped to gawk. Under the fake-porphyry columns of the NatWest bank, Rude Boy was waggling his little dick in the unaware face of a Dutch tourist who was having her cheese-head cheesily portrayed by an Ethiopian economic migrant. Lithy shinnied up, arm over arm, to grab the bottom bead of my amber necklace, and pulled itself into the shelter of my bosom. How strange it is never really to be able to touch another. During the sixties I always wondered at those astronauts, not being able adequately to describe what it was like to be weightless. I figured that maybe they sent really stupid people into space, but over the last eleven years I've learned that some sensations are like that. When you're dead you can hold yourself against a thing, you can rub up and down, intent upon the precise degree of resistance the surface presents, but you won't feel it; it doesn't touch you. Still, we all do it - this pretence of touching one another. It seems to come naturally enough - wouldn't you agree? - when you're dead. I've never altogether missed that aspect of life - the physical aspect, the insidey-outsidey part of it. I didn't even have a dead little twin to meet on the other side - like so many do. The idiot twin in my life was that big blonde slab-body I shlepped around with me, all heavy and stupid and inert and smiling thickly, for my entire fucking adult life. And then the cancer yet! I had a ridiculously late menopause for a woman so obviously past it. Fancy that - hardly had I given a final flush to the bloody cistern of menstruation when the alarm went off somewhere and the cells began to divide. Some wiseacre told me - when I was actually fucking dying - that a foetus undergoes far more rapid cell division during ontogeny than any cancer. Great. He died three years after me - cancer too - and at that time I was still naive enough to imagine that what the afterlife chiefly provided were unrivalled opportunities for unbeatable gloating, unbelievable schadenfreude. So English, that - a nation who've always been convulsed by the world's pratfall, when it was they who yanked away the chair. So, anyway, I went and had a look, maybe manifested myself a little - I don't remember - but I tried to make his death a misery, whispering, 'Dividing-dividing-dividing...' in his ear. Who knows. Who knows. In Piccadilly there were unquiet spirits aplenty, the futile shades of dead junkies and drabs and auto-accident victims, who make it their business to whirl distractedly around Eros's standard. I'd like to see the seance that could get in touch with this roundabout of loons. I tell you I wouldn't even have noticed this crappy cavalcade had it not been for Rude Boy, who always insists on joining in, ripping the ectoplasm from their shoulders, flinging it into the air like he was a pizza chef. I shouted at him to come on, and Lithy piped up as well, 'Come on-comeon-Come on-comeon! D'you wanna be in my gang, my gang, my gang, d'you wanna be in my gang - oh yeah!' And this did bring Rude Boy over, but only to cuff Lithy, who screeched and appealed to me, but I shoved it off and it kicked at Rude Boy and Rude Boy kicked out again. As ever it was difficult to tell what infuriated them more, their own hated consanguinity or their inability ever actually to land a blow, one on the other. So, they followed me on down through Piccadilly bickering and sniping and contradicting each other. Kids, huh. Yeah, the unceasing awareness of underwear - I don't miss it. I remember being in Tuscany, in the mid-seventies, and all I could focus on in a beautiful Renaissance palazzo I visited, the only fucking thing in room after room of paintings and furniture and glass and Christ knows what, was a door-lock which resembled a bra-hook - flat eyes. The only thing I could hang on to all that hot, scented, beautifully touchy-feely afternoon. Must've been 'cause I had diarrhoea. It used to do that to me - crank up the unceasing underwear-awareness. Obviously. Standing underneath Eros, I hoped the deatheaucracy had rented somewhere special for this meeting, because I wanted it to be a special meeting. I'd spent yonks dragging around their offices in Eltham, Ongar, Barking and Thurrock. You're familiar with the premises they favour, leased with the evidence of failed businesses still stacked about: Nobbo peg-boards, Sasco year planners, redundant Roladexes, outmoded computing equipment. Yeah, this is the kind of swinging scene the deatheaucracy favours. Indeed, it's difficult - wouldn'tjew say - to see them in any other context, ratty little men in brown suits that they are. Just as it's impossible to imagine them not twiddling with their computer-games consoles, or fiddling with their Gameboys. Why can it be that the people who run death have such a reliable appetite for gadgets, fads, crazes - anything, in fact, that will allow them the opportunity to fidget for hour after hour, while the traffic clots in the arteries outside, and we shades gather among the shadows in the waiting room. Still, as you know, not all the people who run death are male; there's the odd woman as well. And very odd they are too, these eternally plain Janes. They're the kind of spinsters who came of age immediately after both wars - women existing within the vacuum of a permanently absented pur\u00e9e of masculinity. Beneath umbrellas of cashmere and cotton they scampered away their lives, eluding the damp mizzle of testosterone. Now they're doing the same in death. Icky! Phar Lap says that most of these secretarial spinnies are unquiet spirits. But I protest that there's nothing quieter than these desiccated women, who tiptoe into meetings, only to deposit another buff folder into the tatty fingers of Mr Glanville, Mr Hartly, or Mr Canter - the mister who's given my application the most consideration over the years. 'You've set your heart on rebirth, then?' Mr Canter said at one of our last encounters, his fingers steepled over the graveyard of an open file. 'Yes, I think death has taught me all that it might.' I had my knees drawn together, my hands clasped in my lap. I clenched my fists and - hey presto! A half-century sloughed off and I was back in the unsuccessful interviews at Barnard and Wellesley, where they looked at my prominent nose from all kinds of angles. 'Oh really.' Canter was wearing his habitual, primitive, Norfolk-cut, Jaeger wool suit. I recognised it from the off as one of George Bernard Shaw's purpose-built garments, and pegged the deatheaucrat accordingly as a Shavian pacifist and freethinker of the Edwardian period. To begin with I was amused to see the people who run death sustaining their crankiness way past the grave - but perhaps it's only the English who do this? I've always suspected that death American-style would've been both glitzier and more convivial. That Bobby Franks would've waited the twelve years for Loeb to turn up, so that the two of them could be pals, play pinochle and wait for Leopold to come from South America. That even a pair like that would eventually knuckle under to the defeat of the will. It's a fact that you need a good background in bureaucracy to run death. I tested for a job with them a couple of years after I died, but, free of arthritis or not, I was told that my typing was too slow, my filing too haphazard. (Although there was general enthusiasm for me among the staff of the office where I was interviewed, when they heard about my background in pen design.) Beyond this I don't believe there's any especial qualification, d'jew? After all, most of the deathly offices are hung with suits from all the decades of the last two hundred years or so. I've seen sharp 1950s sharkskin single-breasters, and tough 1930s twill sacks; 1890s nankeen frock coats and 1870s sawtooth cutaways. But mostly, the hideous brown-and- chalk-stripe double-breasteds of the 1940s predominate, I guess because this was when the bureaucratic type came to the fore - and we all went for a Burton. Left in charge by their more belligerent brothers, the paper-pilers and pen-pushers remained in the rear, both armies of non-combatants speaking ACRONYM, and perfecting the office management systems that would come to dominate the post-war world. Alan Turing was the originator of the spreadsheet, in case you didn't realise. 'Oh really.' Canter said it again and I savour it anew. There are some good things about death as well as many bad ones. The good things include the time to sit and stare. There's no hurry. In between the 'Oh' and the 'really' I had plenty of time to examine chipped chipboard partitions and dense slabs of MDF. Time to see that in this office - above a dry-cleaner's premises on Willesden High Road - the Dexion cradle within which Canter's department carts around its nyujo occupies a dominant position. Canter and his staff have always loved telling me, 'Oh, you know, it's a very fine nyujo, a very perspicacious one - we do so like to keep it with us.' D'jew know the nyujo? It's the petrified corpse of a long-gone scrivener, who saw fit to meditate himself into a crystalline state. The one belonging to this department achieved this by ceaselessly revolving on his Parker Knoll beneath an interminable succession of plastic demijohns of Buxton mineral water, upended by his disciples and set, one after the other, atop his Dexion cubicle. From time to time small basins of Tipp-Ex were thrown over his bowed head, staples fired at him from acolytes' guns, labels of all sorts affixed - Post-it notes ditto. Over the years this figurehead has swollen to alarming proportions - a dumpy Buddha, encrusted with stationery. Yet still he's humped from one defunct travel agency to the next busted electrical wholesaler's in his papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 palanquin. I expect you've discovered they're immensely proud of their statue of Anubis too? Pathetic isn't it, the way they drag it around whichever block it is that they're currently tenanting, as if it were a recalcitrant old pampered doggie. Still, I suppose it is. The living, I guess, would expect the coincidence of different eras of suiting, and the presence of Cratchit clerks playing Nintendo, to give these offices an anachronistic air. We know it's not so. It's always the dumb mistake of the living to imagine themselves contemporary. 'Every period I've lived through has seemed like now to me,' my second husband was fond of saying - fondness was his forte. He was no more fond of me or his daughters or his mother than he was of his dog, or his golf bag, or his penis. Fondness was inscribed on his heart when I cut it out still beating. Only kidding. Yaws kept prodigiously exact records of the Now during his entire lifetime, detailing every little particle of its extinction. When, after his own, I came to read them, they proved to my entire satisfaction that the over-examined life is hardly worth living; and that while ostensibly he had died of a routine cardiac infarction, he had in fact, like so many of his ilk - permanently adolescent, upper-middle-class, minor-public-school-educated Englishmen - strolled back to the Elysian pavilion, his entry in the scorebook marked 'Retired bored'. 'Oh really?' Had Canter said it yet again? He'd definitely caught me eyeing the fucking nyujo, because he continued, 'You hadn't perhaps considered becoming a nyujo yourself?' 'I'm sorry?' I replied - although I'd heard him only too clearly. 'Liberation through hearing on the after-death plane - you're familiar with it of course?' 'Of course.' They always talk like this, don't they, the brown suits, the deatheaucrats, effortlessly rendering the transcendent banal. 'But I'd rather set my heart on living again.' 'We've got all sorts of new animating principles available, you know - flesh harvests of anencephalic stillborn infants coming through all the time-' He broke off to address a passing clerk: 'Mr Davis? You wouldn't be so kind as to bring over the Roladex with the anencephalic stillborn infants' animating principles on it, would you?' 'Truly, I have no desire to be nyujo, and I'd rather counted on being me on the next go-round, as it were.' 'You appreciate that you'll actually be more you if you accept a new animating principle, hmm? There'll be a more ... how can I put it? ... porous barrier between your assemblages of memories.' 'I know this, yes - but I won't be me. Me. Me.' 'Quite so.' Yes, I kid you not - this is the kind of dreck he tried to palm me off with. Still, at least I wasn't among the living, stumbling about the joint imagining themselves painted up with the present, when it ain't necessarily so. Their minds are full of dead ideas, images and distorted facts. Their visual field is cluttered up with decaying buildings, rusting cars, potholed roads and an imperfectly realised sky, which darkens towards the horizon of history. They take in all ages in the one frame every time they snap the city with their Brownie brainboxes. Their very noses are clogged with dying hairs, moribund skin, stratified snot - they're smelling the past; and feeling it too - between their toes, their thighs, the pits of their arms: ssshk- shk! Peeling back the years. Whereas we, the dead, are the true inheritors of the Modern. The live lot assemble time into lazy decadences - ten-year periods of conspicuous attitudinising, which are only ever grasped in nostalgic retrospect. My second husband was a profoundly ancient man, a Neolithic stone- knapper. But we... we see it all; anachro-spectacles are the only ones we wear. So these interminable branch offices that I've revolved through, while Lithy sat in my lap and Rude Boy ranted in the vestibule, trying to piss on back numbers of the Reader's Digest, haven't been so strange, or so different. Anyway, I'm getting off the point, which Canter never has. 'Thank you, Mr Davis,' he said, taking receipt of the relevant buff folder. 'You see, Ms Bloom - or rather your death guide... Mr... Jones, ye-es Jones, may have told you - we have our own calculus here, our own ways of proceeding?' 'I'm only too well aware.' 'This isn't' - then he really did take off his wire-rimmed spectacles, and run his hand through his sparse, sandy hair, giving me time to appreciate, once again, that instead of being determined by the magisterially pompous English gentile who I'd thought was going to decide it, my fate was in the waxy paws of a ratty little Jew - 'any longer a matter of how you conducted yourself on your last \"go-round\", as you put it.' 'Mr Canter, sir' - such honorifics came naturally when I was addressing someone who hadn't taken a shit since 1953 - 'I'm only too well aware of the implications of karma.' 'On the before-death plane perhaps - but after death? You died, in 1988, owing over two thousand pounds to the Inland Revenue. Monies which had, subsequently, to be disbursed by your estate - ' 'Is this strictly relevant?' 'Oh yes, accounts are accounts - and we are - ' Accountants. Save for his peculiar colleagues, Mr Canter is well-nigh indistinguishable from Mr Weintraub, who, when I saw him for the last time - the cancer scooping out my left boob as if it were a fucking avocado - assured me he'd take care of the relevant returns... sitting in his aggressively Artexed office, off the North Circular by Brent Cross, playing with a Bic Cristal and annotating the accounts I myself had laboriously put together. ' - concerned here with totting up all the relevant columns. We'll be doing this for most of the next year, so don't be alarmed if your neighbours - you live in Dulburb?' 'Dulston,' I grunted. 'Dulston, quite so, a lovely area, very much village London. Anyway, if you should hear that certain enquiries are being made about you, rest assured that it's only us. And now,' he screwed his doughy butt into the swivel chair as if he were intent on sodomy, 'there's the matter of sex.' 'Sex?' 'Indeed, you will not, I hope, find yourself too discomfited by a resumption in sexual feelings, hmm? Merely psychic to begin with, but very real for all that.' He paused for effect and a zombie brought in tea and Nice biscuits. Mr Canter and I sat either side of them for the remainder of the interview. After I'd left, another zombie returned to take them away. Funny how we dead never eat - yet still, some of us love to serve food. Well, that was one of the last encounters with Canter, as I say. And earlier this evening, in Piccadilly now, I was beset by a liquefying inundation of orgasms - of dicks stirring me up. When I was abandoned in the wastes of late middle age, my flesh folding, then frowning into sour slackness, I wanted my sex cut out - and so it was; in death, at least. Who cut the cookie with the cookie cutter? But ever since Miles and Natasha got down to it in the gauche apartment on Regent's Park Road, I've been tormented by lust and jealousy. Who'd ever have thought they'd be welcome again in this old house, behind this envious green door? Ethereal fingers prinking my pussy. My first husband, jolly Dave Kaplan, he used to say that his beard was like 'wearing a pussy on my face - I've only got to stroke my chin and I feel real comfy'. It's Dave I thought of in, Piccadilly. Or rather, it was the incongruous liver spot, adrift in his sparse hairline, that I pictured. It was always this scrap of yellow-brown I focused on as I willed myself towards another orgasm of crushing non-spontaneity. Years after the marriage was over - the late sixties to be vaguely precise - when we'd occasionally meet in Manhattan for lunch - those good, wholesome divorcees' lunches, the only ones people who've been sexually involved can have and still enjoy their food - he divulged that while I was looking at his liver spot and imagining myself ecstatic, he was concentrating hard on the mole on my chin, while willing himself to detumesce. 'Touche pas!' I laughed, and raised my glass of Zinfandel. 'Yes,' he continued, 'I've spent possibly years of my life entirely absorbed in the pimples, blemishes and other imperfections of beautiful women.' And as if called to stimulate himself by this revelation, he meditatively stroked his pussy. Spontaneous or not, I did use to orgasm with Kaplan. I did clutch his arched neck, groan, say things - I did that crap. I loved sex - or rather, like so many women of my era, I loved the idea of sex. Sex garbed in romantic weeds, sex with strong self-assured men rather than puling boychicks. Set against imaginings like these the real thing was never that great, natch; the dildo would have to be dressed. I knew even then, from talking to the boychicks themselves (and was there ever a century like the twentieth for chewing things over; 'Time as a Cud' - discuss), that their chief sexual hang-up was the reverse of mine - a hang-down, if you like. For all these guys sex was too sexy. That's why Dave confined himself to the mole. We'd gone a couple more blocks and I couldn't see Phar Lap Jones ahead of me, when 'Oimissus!' - there he was, sitting, back against the wall, beside one of the alleyways that leads into the Albany. With the brim of his white Stetson pulled down low, he wasn't much more than black jeans, bullroarer and outsize punishment boomerangs. He looked just like any of the other alien sophomores who've enrolled for this year's London Summer School of the Didgeridoo. 'Oi!' He'd managed to mooch a meat pie from somewhere along the way. Strange, this being Kebabistan, rather than Fish-and-Chiplington. He chews up these hassocks of mince and onion after he's skin-popped them with brown sauce. It's a newly-coined Strine tradition of his. Meat-pie dreaming - I guess. But he never swallows it, none of us does, do we. Anyway, as I say, there he was in the alleyway and I felt this aching desire to get in there with him, to cram myself inside that gully of old bricks. I was half-convinced that for the first time in eleven years I'd get some abrasion, some rasp - between Phar Lap and the wall, that is. I may even have begun insinuating myself, because he said, 'Juda! Lily, not in there, girl, that's bad, you can't go in there.' 'Where? The Albany?' 'No, that fuckin' buju, girl!' He made as if to pull me along with him and I followed in his wake, the two of us breasting the summertime crowds, who had now, like brown rats, sensed the explosion five blocks away by mood transmission. It made them all look as ugly as they are for a change. 'You feel that, didya?' he said. 'What's that?' 'No more of yer stupid colourlessness of indifference, hey-yeh?' 'No, I really wanted to get in that alleyway - ' 'With me, yuwai, an' you been thinkin' 'bout rootin' long time now, yeh-hey?' 'Ye-es.' 'You've bin dead too long, girl, dead too long. Those dead souls on Old Compton Street, they passed clean through and you never broke step. I saw that.' 'So you - you do think rebirth would be a good idea... in my case?' He stopped again, this time right next to a woman who was squinting into the air, arm outstretched, as if hailing a cab driven by Zeus across the fiery evening sky. Phar Lap was so close to her that he damped himself down a little - and so did I. We whittled our presences away. That's what we dead do, isn't it? Shave ourselves out of the designer-stubbled faces of the living. Rude Boy came and sat on the kerb by us. Lithy, amazingly, leant against Rude Boy's knee. 'Is it that you wanna get shot of these fellers, yeh-hey?' 'No! I mean - maybe. I don't know. But if I am reborn I've children to talk to among the living - even if I leave these two behind.' 'Yeh-hey! You don't wanna be alone ever, d'you Lily?' 'Do you?' 'I never am. Listen, don' go crawlin' into no cracks, not now. You hold back on those wantin' feelings you're gettin', yeh? You do bad shit now and you're done for girl, see? It'll come back at you like this here kayan - see?' He waved his big, black boomerang to bludgeon home his point. 'Now snap it up - Mr Canter is waitin' for you.' He lifted his arm up in front of the vacant eyes of the living woman and grabbed the cab. That's how I ended up here with you. Stuck here in the waiting room, anticipating my final encounter with the deatheaucracy - for the time being. Christmas 2001 Yeah, but there was more, hindsight multiplying me like opposing mirrors set either side of a restaurant booth. Because as we boarded the cab I remembered. This rush across this West End, ignoring the bombing in Old Compton Street, forcing Rude Boy to keep the pace: we were in a hurry - I was in a hurry. Now, that's one thing you never do when you're dead. There's no rush when you're dead. You may have scrambled up the dark stairs to confront it, nose to the musty carpet, anticipating its horror for every one of those fifteen steps, expecting it every inch of the half-landing. But there's no rushing once you've seen him, her and it. No rushing once you're there. Only pottering around. Pottering around for eternity.",

Think about it. The ways students interact with each other and with me are just so interesting. <br><strong>4.</strong> Those moments when you know everyone in a room is listening to you and really concentrating on what you're saying.

      "bodyText": "Here are ten reasons, in no particular order, why I hate my job: 1. I work non-stop for at least eight hours a day, five days a week. 2. It's utterly exhausting. 3. I can't do my job with a hangover. 4. Bumping into kids in the supermarket, especially on a Saturday or Sunday morning. 5. Dealing with rude, arrogant people who think they're the most important person on earth (I blame the parents). 6. Teachers are consistently undermined and undervalued by the government, whichever one is in charge. 7. When at work, I'm constantly (and I mean constantly) on show. 8. It sometimes gets hard to remember who the real me is - 'Miss' or 'Emily'. 9. I don't get paid enough. 10. Constantly having to talk at people who don't want to listen and really couldn't care less what I have to say. Now here are ten reasons why I love my job: 1. Seeing people do a new and wonderful experiment for the first time - from lighting a bunsen burner in Year 7 to making slime with 12EP to studying the colours of transition metal ions in Year 12. 2. You can never (and I mean never) predict what's going to happen next. 3. People are fascinating. Think about it. The ways students interact with each other and with me are just so interesting. 4. Those moments when you know everyone in a room is listening to you and really concentrating on what you're saying. That's an amazing feeling. A real ego trip. It makes you stop still inside and wonder if you can really be that interesting. 5. Hard work pays off. You put in the effort, you get rewards (mostly). 6. Those other moments when you teach someone a new concept and they understand it and they're pleased. 7. Other moments when you feel, for one reason or another, that you've touched someone's life personally. 8. Talking a student out of a major strop.

I've had an upset tummy since I got back from Corfu so you can imagine the state my car was in when I finally got home.\"</p> <p>The situation has been exacerbated by a series of recently-installed traffic-calming measures which have meant that even when they do finally get moving drivers are still faced with an assault course of humps and width-restricters before they can finally get on their way.</p> <p>\"There are some short term difficulties,\" admitted a council spokesman, \"But we are doing our very best to tackle them.\"</p> <p>But one local pensioner sighed: \"Even on an empty road my wife creeps along like she's in a traffic jam, so to be honest none of this has really made any difference to us.\"<br><strong>The York Evening Press</strong></p> <h2>A hole lot of trouble</h2> <p> Road problems of a different sort in the Midlands town of Sandwell, which is currently suffering from an epidemic of drain-cover thefts.</p> <p>Over the past few weeks more than forty drain-covers have gone missing from the roads and pavements around the town, at a cost of almost \u00a310,000 to the local council.</p> <p>\"This is a major problem,\" said local councillor Keith Davies. \"Louts are stealing the covers and leaving holes that someone could fall down in the dark and break a leg. It's a highly dangerous thing to do and could cost lives.\"</p> <p>The problem has been made worse by the fact that the covers are of a style that is no longer made, and the drains therefore have to be redrilled to accommodate new-style caps.</p> <p>Fortunately to date there have been no serious injuries as a result of the disappearing manhole lids, although one man did suffer nasty scratches after swerving to avoid an open hole and falling into a display of ornamental cacti outside a local florists.</p> <p>\"Somebody's stolen all the loo paper from the public toilets as well,\" fumed one lifelong Sandwell resident. \"This town isn't what it used to be.\"<br><strong>The West Midlands Express and Star</strong></p> <h2>A chuckle a day...</h2> <p>Hilarious goings on in Cheltenham this week with the opening of Britain's first official therapeutic Laughter Club.</p> <p>The club is the brainchild of Indian Doctor Madan Kataria, who believes that regular bouts of laughing can both relieve stress and ward off a host of illnesses such as heart and lung disease. \"Laughing can really improve our health,\" explained doctor Kataria, 44. \"The only reason people do not laugh more is because they are naturally shy, and so I try to help them release that shyness.\"</p> <p>To this end he has developed a series of group exercises designed to make people burst into spontaneous laughter, a technique that has lead to the opening of over 500 Laughter Clubs around the world.</p> <p>Eleven people attended his first British session, paying \u00a3400 each for the pleasure of three-days unbridled chuckling. \"It was wonderful,\" said one woman. \"I came out feeling like a new person. It really worked.\"</p> <p>Not everyone, however, is as convinced by Dr. Kataria's methods. \"It's just a fad,\" said one local doctor, \"Like all this aromatherapy rubbish.

The roadworks, which began this week and involve the resurfacing of a series of major arterial routes, has turned the city into one enormous gridlock, especially at rush hour, when a journey of only a few hundred yards can, apparently, take anything up to an hour to complete. \"It's a nightmare,\" fumed one local motorist. \"The other day I tried to drive down to the supermarket for some sponge cake and spent most of the afternoon sitting in a traffic jam. I've had an upset tummy since I got back from Corfu so you can imagine the state my car was in when I finally got home.\" The situation has been exacerbated by a series of recently-installed traffic-calming measures which have meant that even when they do finally get moving drivers are still faced with an assault course of humps and width-restricters before they can finally get on their way. \"There are some short term difficulties,\" admitted a council spokesman, \"But we are doing our very best to tackle them.\" But one local pensioner sighed: \"Even on an empty road my wife creeps along like she's in a traffic jam, so to be honest none of this has really made any difference to us.\" The York Evening Press A hole lot of trouble Road problems of a different sort in the Midlands town of Sandwell, which is currently suffering from an epidemic of drain-cover thefts. Over the past few weeks more than forty drain-covers have gone missing from the roads and pavements around the town, at a cost of almost \u00a310,000 to the local council. \"This is a major problem,\" said local councillor Keith Davies. \"Louts are stealing the covers and leaving holes that someone could fall down in the dark and break a leg. It's a highly dangerous thing to do and could cost lives.\" The problem has been made worse by the fact that the covers are of a style that is no longer made, and the drains therefore have to be redrilled to accommodate new-style caps. Fortunately to date there have been no serious injuries as a result of the disappearing manhole lids, although one man did suffer nasty scratches after swerving to avoid an open hole and falling into a display of ornamental cacti outside a local florists. \"Somebody's stolen all the loo paper from the public toilets as well,\" fumed one lifelong Sandwell resident. \"This town isn't what it used to be.\" The West Midlands Express and Star A chuckle a day... Hilarious goings on in Cheltenham this week with the opening of Britain's first official therapeutic Laughter Club. The club is the brainchild of Indian Doctor Madan Kataria, who believes that regular bouts of laughing can both relieve stress and ward off a host of illnesses such as heart and lung disease. \"Laughing can really improve our health,\" explained doctor Kataria, 44. \"The only reason people do not laugh more is because they are naturally shy, and so I try to help them release that shyness.\" To this end he has developed a series of group exercises designed to make people burst into spontaneous laughter, a technique that has lead to the opening of over 500 Laughter Clubs around the world. Eleven people attended his first British session, paying \u00a3400 each for the pleasure of three-days unbridled chuckling. \"It was wonderful,\" said one woman. \"I came out feeling like a new person. It really worked.\" Not everyone, however, is as convinced by Dr. Kataria's methods. \"It's just a fad,\" said one local doctor, \"Like all this aromatherapy rubbish. If you really want to guard against disease what you need is a good night's sleep and a yoghurt enema once a week.\" Gloucestershire Echo Letter of the Week Last night I met some dear friends at the Casa Loco restaurant in Rugby, where we had an excellent meal. I then drove home down the Leicester Road and into Newton Lane, where I discovered six completely naked men dancing in the road. I was rather surprised since the night air was extremely chilled, although I concluded that they were certainly not intending to commit a robbery since they didn't have a pocket between them. I can only imagine that they were following the Road Safety Code: \"Wear something that sticks out at night\". I congratulate them on their achievement, though for my part a reflective jacket is a preferred alternative. A Surprised Resident Catthorpe Village The Rugby Advertiser",

Blitz for about 15 secs until roughly chopped. 2 . Whip cream until really stiff. Fold in half of the chopped strawberries. 3 . Blob half the cream/strawberry mixture between halves of meringues and place on plate. 4 . Dollop the rest of the mixture over and around the meringue, and arrange remaining chopped stawberries at artistic intervals around the plate. Ms L Castle, London If you have any hints for Cheat's kitchen, send them to The Guzzler, The Guardian, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER On the menu: parfait How do you pronounce that? \"Parfay\" as in \"it's a parfay day\". Oh, very funny. Well, what is it? A rich, frozen pudding made, usually, of something and cream and eggs. Ice cream, you mean? Don't be so coarse. A parfait is to ice cream what pt\u00e9 de foie gras is to meat paste. So it's a bit refined, you mean. And a bit more delicate, too. Chefs love a bit of parfait - nougat is very popular at the moment, although you may also have noticed prune chocolate and Armagnac, and raspberry. Still sounds like ice cream to me. Come to think of it, you do get a chicken liver parfait, too. That isn't ice cream. Nobody's parfait. Food on the net www.foodoo.com An unusual one, this, set up as a forum dedicated to food as a pleasure. So there's nothing to buy, and not much to plug. It wants to be a site where chefs and other food lovers swap tips, recipes and thoughts. Pros: Hosting pages for a number of big names - including Gordon Ramsay, Gary Rhodes and John Torode - foodoo can offer a range of impressive recipes, plus the musings of the professionals on food trends. Cons: A risk of becoming a sounding board for chefs? Antony Worrall Thompson's exhortations to show some national pride in the Dome seem out of place here. Coming soon: Extensive food glossary and a searchable recipe database.",

      "bodyText": "Helmut Kohl, the fallen giant of German politics, went on to the counter-attack yesterday. Making a long-awaited appearance before the parliamentary commission of inquiry which is looking into whether his government traded favours for illegal party donations, he insisted he was the victim of a systematic campaign to discredit him. To him, the far-reaching scandal was not about his point-blank refusal to comply with a law which his own cabinet had introduced, its authors' aim was to \"wipe out from history 16 successful years\". In a frequently ill-tempered appearance before the press during a break in the proceedings, Mr Kohl turned on the media, describing the journalists on two of Germany's leading publications as \"idiots\". The former chancellor singled out a documentary by the state-funded ARD television channel as a prime example of the media campaign against him; it reported that his party had received DM30m (\u00a39.6m) - claims Mr Kohl dismissed out of hand. When a reporter addressed him as \"Herr Kohl\", he angrily corrected him, insisting that he be addressed as \"Herr Doktor Kohl\". His opening statement to the commission was a rambling affair that lasted an hour and a quarter. Mr Kohl huffed and puffed - but failed to shake the growing edifice of evidence stacked up against him. The latest massive slab was lowered into place on Wednesday when an investigator reported that two-thirds of the data in the former chancellor's office had been erased in the days before he left power. But Mr Kohl indignantly dismissed the suspicion underlying the inquiry. \"Never in my entire life could I be bought,\" he said. The former chancellor and his party officials hid from public and official scrutiny the source of millions of pounds they received, despite introducing a law during Mr Kohl's 16-year chancellorship which required the disclosure of all contributions exceeding \u00a36,400, precisely in order to deter bribery. Mr Kohl has admitted to personally receiving up to \u00a3640,000 between 1993 and his departure from office in 1998. As he highlighted yesterday, it was a small amount in the context of the Christian Democratic Union's (CDU) overall funding - 2% of what the party received during that five-year period. The only donation of which anything is known was made by an intermediary in an arms deal which had required - and been given - cabinet approval. More vehemently than ever, Mr Kohl yesterday refused to divulge the names of his other benefactors. With a sublime indifference to the requirements of the law, the former chancellor explained that he had taken the money in cash because the donors wanted to remain anonymous and would not have contributed otherwise. He has said that they were CDU sympathisers who wanted to support the party's work in the formerly communist East Germany following reunification. Mr Kohl's uncompromising stance exasperated even members of his own party, which is still suffering from the consequences of the scandal; one party MP, Friedbert Pfl\u00fcger, called it \"unacceptable\". A member of the commission of inquiry who belongs to the former communist Party of Democratic Socialism, meanwhile, called for the former chancellor to be sent to jail. Evelyn Kenzler said Dr Kohl should be \"put into coercive detention until such time as he is willing to give the names\".",

Ten years later the FBI was reporting on a \" smear campaign\" organised in East Berlin claiming that Orwell's satire was based on real life in America \"where police survellience and investigation has surpassed the world and had no equals. \"Already today an American lives, so to speak, under a glass cover, and is viewed from all sides,\" said a report which was distributed across the communist world.",

      "body": "<p>Monetary union and enlargement to the east have led to a renewed debate about the future of Europe. Visions of what Europe might look like 20 years from now - and what Britain's role in it will be - are coming thick and fast. Is it feasible for Europe to carry on as before with 25 members and a single currency? Is the answer full political integration, or a much looser arrangement that treats Europe as a free trade area but leaves most powers with national governments? Or something in between? All options can be catered for in the great game of fantasy politics. </p> <p><strong> 1: United States of Europe</strong><br> </p> <p>Brussels would be the capital, Strasbourg the home of the parliament, London the financial capital. A European army under a single command structure would protect the borders and the European social model would keep the world's biggest market safe from cut-throat American-style capitalism. This is the Europe of full political integration, the option that allows the continent to rise above the petty squabbles of national governments and to punch its full weight on the world stage. </p> <p>Germany's foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, is the most prominent European politician to have floated the idea of full political union, but the idea of \"ever-closer union\" goes back to the days when Jean Monnet and other founding fathers were putting together their blueprint in the aftermath of the second world war. </p> <p>The arguments for a \"European superstate\" vary. For some, it is simply a question of efficiency. </p> <p>At the moment, Europe is a halfway house - it has one interest rate and one exchange rate, but a host of different tax rates and no effective mechanism for redistribution. </p> <p>Some of its members get involved in conflicts like that in Kosovo, but co-ordination is difficult with each capital making decisions on involvement and deployment of troops. Moreover, expansion to the east means that the current institutional framework, with national vetos in many areas of policy, will ossify. </p> <p>Another group uses these arguments to cloak a visceral anti-Americanism. Since the end of the cold war, the United States has been the world's sole superpower, but Europe could fill the vacuum left by the collapse of communism. However, until it recognises that globalisation is increasingly making the medium-sized nation state obsolete, Europe will continue to dance to Washington's tune. </p> <p>The chances of a superstate arriving any time soon are remote. Why? First, there are immense practical difficulties in putting together a nation out of so many disparate traditions, culture, languages, histories and economies. Poland does not have much in common with Portugal, for example. Second, many of those countries likely to join the EU in the near future have recent - and bitter - experience of de facto political union with the Soviet Union and are enjoying independent status. </p> <p>Finally, European politicians show very little willingness to forego national advantage in favour of what most of them see as a utopian vision. As the wrangling over who should be the first president of the European Central Bank showed, national squabbling is likely to go on for some time to come. Politicians love squabbling. It's what they do best. </p> <p><strong> 2: The special relationship</strong><br> </p> <p>After rejecting the single currency in a referendum and following several more years of increasing isolation, Britain cuts its ties with the European Union and applies for membership of Nafta, the North American free trade agreement. Some supporters of ever closer links between the English speaking nations take the fantasy one stage further and envisage the UK as the 51st and most powerful state of the union. We have the Hollywood movies, we have the burgers, we have the shopping malls, so why not go the whole hog and have the political clout that being a state more populous and richer than California would bring? </p> <p>In some ways, this scenario is the mirror image of the European superstate. Again, there is a logic to it. Britain signed up for a free trade agreement when it joined the then European Economic Community in 1973. It didn't sign up for monetary union (something explicitly ruled out by the Yes campaign in the 1975 referendum), let alone political union. </p> <p>The British public will not buy the idea of \"ever closer union\" and while Britain would prefer to remain a member of the EU, voters would rather leave than be part of a superstate. Membership of the World Trade Organisation would give Britain many of the benefits it presently enjoys by being a part of the European Union, and it would gain even more by becoming part of Nafta, because the US has been far more successful in creating jobs than Europe. </p> <p>John Redwood, sacked from the shadow cabinet by William Hague, and Conrad Black, proprietor of the Daily and Sunday Telegraphs, have floated membership of Nafta as an option, and it is also being investigated by Republicans in Congress. According to Mr Black, the White House front runner, George W Bush, is also interested. </p> <p>As with full political integration, this does not seem a realistic short-term possibility.

      "bodyText": "Monetary union and enlargement to the east have led to a renewed debate about the future of Europe. Visions of what Europe might look like 20 years from now - and what Britain's role in it will be - are coming thick and fast. Is it feasible for Europe to carry on as before with 25 members and a single currency? Is the answer full political integration, or a much looser arrangement that treats Europe as a free trade area but leaves most powers with national governments? Or something in between? All options can be catered for in the great game of fantasy politics. 1: United States of Europe Brussels would be the capital, Strasbourg the home of the parliament, London the financial capital. A European army under a single command structure would protect the borders and the European social model would keep the world's biggest market safe from cut-throat American-style capitalism. This is the Europe of full political integration, the option that allows the continent to rise above the petty squabbles of national governments and to punch its full weight on the world stage. Germany's foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, is the most prominent European politician to have floated the idea of full political union, but the idea of \"ever-closer union\" goes back to the days when Jean Monnet and other founding fathers were putting together their blueprint in the aftermath of the second world war. The arguments for a \"European superstate\" vary. For some, it is simply a question of efficiency. At the moment, Europe is a halfway house - it has one interest rate and one exchange rate, but a host of different tax rates and no effective mechanism for redistribution. Some of its members get involved in conflicts like that in Kosovo, but co-ordination is difficult with each capital making decisions on involvement and deployment of troops. Moreover, expansion to the east means that the current institutional framework, with national vetos in many areas of policy, will ossify. Another group uses these arguments to cloak a visceral anti-Americanism. Since the end of the cold war, the United States has been the world's sole superpower, but Europe could fill the vacuum left by the collapse of communism. However, until it recognises that globalisation is increasingly making the medium-sized nation state obsolete, Europe will continue to dance to Washington's tune. The chances of a superstate arriving any time soon are remote. Why? First, there are immense practical difficulties in putting together a nation out of so many disparate traditions, culture, languages, histories and economies. Poland does not have much in common with Portugal, for example. Second, many of those countries likely to join the EU in the near future have recent - and bitter - experience of de facto political union with the Soviet Union and are enjoying independent status. Finally, European politicians show very little willingness to forego national advantage in favour of what most of them see as a utopian vision. As the wrangling over who should be the first president of the European Central Bank showed, national squabbling is likely to go on for some time to come. Politicians love squabbling. It's what they do best. 2: The special relationship After rejecting the single currency in a referendum and following several more years of increasing isolation, Britain cuts its ties with the European Union and applies for membership of Nafta, the North American free trade agreement. Some supporters of ever closer links between the English speaking nations take the fantasy one stage further and envisage the UK as the 51st and most powerful state of the union. We have the Hollywood movies, we have the burgers, we have the shopping malls, so why not go the whole hog and have the political clout that being a state more populous and richer than California would bring? In some ways, this scenario is the mirror image of the European superstate. Again, there is a logic to it. Britain signed up for a free trade agreement when it joined the then European Economic Community in 1973. It didn't sign up for monetary union (something explicitly ruled out by the Yes campaign in the 1975 referendum), let alone political union. The British public will not buy the idea of \"ever closer union\" and while Britain would prefer to remain a member of the EU, voters would rather leave than be part of a superstate. Membership of the World Trade Organisation would give Britain many of the benefits it presently enjoys by being a part of the European Union, and it would gain even more by becoming part of Nafta, because the US has been far more successful in creating jobs than Europe. John Redwood, sacked from the shadow cabinet by William Hague, and Conrad Black, proprietor of the Daily and Sunday Telegraphs, have floated membership of Nafta as an option, and it is also being investigated by Republicans in Congress. According to Mr Black, the White House front runner, George W Bush, is also interested. As with full political integration, this does not seem a realistic short-term possibility. Labour and the Liberal Democrats believe the idea is barmy, and Mr Hague would be branded as a dangerous isolationist if he even hinted that Conservative opposition to the single currency was hardening into a call for withdrawal from the EU. The Americans can envisage a North Atlantic free trade agreement, but see this as involving the whole of the EU, not just Britain. 3: Europe of nation states The Dutch stay Dutch, the French stay French, and the British stay British, but they all learn to rub along together and welcome more and more countries into the club. This is the Euro 2000 option, where every country retains its own distinct national identity, its own flag, and its own football team but within an over-arching structure that deepens and broadens Europe. It is in the interests of Europe to co-op erate in some areas - the single market, the environment - but this will not stop national governments from seeking to shape the future of Europe in ways that benefit their own voters. The realities of the modern world mean that power will be shared between Europe-wide institutions such as the European Central Bank. Instead of there being some federalist blueprint for a superstate in safes in Berlin, Brussels and Paris, the process will continue to be confused. Almost every EU minister would sign up to this vision of Europe, at least in public. Given both the lack of public support in many countries for full-scale political union and the expansion process, there is no alternative but to muddle along. If it proves that monetary union will not be truly effective without fiscal union, then that bridge can be crossed when the time is ripe. If some countries want to explore the possibilities of closer union when others do not, then they will inevitably do so. But the moves will only be successful if that is what the voters want. The real question, however, is whether this mix 'n' match experiment will work or whether it will all collapse in the absence of a clearer idea of what Europe is for and where it is going. To take but one example, monetary unions have in the past not been able to survive and thrive outside of political unions. At some point, hard choices look inevitable that involve issues fundamental to governance. Everything may work out. The EU may expand its borders while simultaneously exercising more effective control from the centre in economic and defence policy, and its leaders may be able to edge down the road towards political union while carrying Europe's population with them. But nobody actually knows how this will be done. Rather like Philip Henslowe, the impresario in Shakespeare in Love who says he cannot justify his optimism that something will turn up because \"it's a mystery\", so Europe's politicians remain confident that they can offer everybody the best of all possible worlds.

In an effort to remain at the heart of Europe - one of his dearest ambitions - Mr Blair flew to Berlin determined to show he can punch his weight on the EU agenda despite Britain's isolation from the single currency zone. The prime minister hinted he would offer concessions to the so-called pioneer group led by France and Germany - but not at the price of creating a formal two-speed Europe. Before dining with Mr Schr\u00f6der in Potsdam, Mr Blair again enthusiastically backed the euro \"in principle\". In the upbeat atmosphere at Potsdam Mr Blair even took time to tell voters at home that they should have \"a little more confidence in our own ability to shape the arguments without constantly worrying that Europe is going to turn into a conspiracy against Britain.\" Yet in a pre-Berlin cabinet briefing, Mr Blair privately signalled that London will have to grant core countries more freedom to move ahead faster than he is either willing or able to, even if it creates the pioneer group suggested by the French president, Jacques Chirac. It is a perilous balancing act, with both his divided cabinet and the Tory leader William Hague watching every move. So, before the two centre-left leaders discussed China, Russia, China and the middle east - as well as the EU - Mr Blair sent out mixed signals about his intentions. They were just as ambiguous as the speech the French president made in Berlin on Tuesday. In a bid to revitalise the Berlin-Paris axis Mr Chirac had ruled out a \"European superstate\" but also called for deeper integration and an EU constitution.

According to a Downing Street spokesman he said: \"Within enlargement we are going to have a situation where there is a need for enhanced cooperation so one country could not block the sensible progress of others.\" In Euro-jargon \"enhanced cooperation\" means changing the mechanism which requires more than half the 15 EU states to endorse an initiative, but only one to block it. If Mr Chirac and other integrators get their way that could be cut to one-third endorsing a scheme and two states needed to exercise the veto, some UK officials think.

Mr Blair has said that a decision to hold a referendum would not be taken until after the next general election, expected next year, but Britain has expressed increasing fears about the development of a \"two-speed\" Europe, with France and Germany making all the decisions. Tory leader William Hague has said he would introduce new laws, if returned to government, which would prevent the European courts from taking any further rights away from Britain without a treaty agreement.",

Copeland, 24, an engineer's assistant from Cove, in Hampshire, has admitted causing the explosion in central London, and two others in Brixton and Brick Lane within the space of 13 days in April last year. But the prosecution refused to accept his pleas of guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. Nigel Sweeney QC, prosecuting, said the crown did not believe Copeland was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia at the time of the bombing campaign. Copeland, he argued, was suffering from a lesser condition, probably a personality disorder, which meant he was guilty of murdering Andrea Dykes, 27, who was four months pregnant, John Light, 32 and Nik Moore, 31. The three friends were drinking in the Admiral Duncan pub when the bomb went off. Seventy-nine others were hurt in the blast. Summing up the four-week case yesterday, the judge, Michael Hyam QC told the jury that if they were sure Copeland had meant his bomb to kill or cause serious injury, then the burden of proof shifted to the defence. Copeland's lawyers had to prove that at the time he planted the bomb he was suffering from \"such abnormality of mind...as to substantially impair his mental responsibility\". The judge added: \"If not, the defendant is guilty of murder.\" Earlier, the court heard that medical witnesses who appeared for the prosecution and defence were in \"complete, headlong, disagreement\" over Copeland's condition. Mr Sweeney told the court that Copeland was a homophobic Nazi who bombed London because he wanted to \"stir up a racial war\". He said Copeland targeted Brixton, in south London, and Brick Lane, in the city's east end, because he knew they were areas where many black and Asian people lived. The Soho bomb, said Mr Sweeney, was not a political statement, but a personal one. \"He hated gay men, his hatred stemming from the way his parents treated him as a child.\" Michael Wolkind, QC, defending, said Copeland had been suffering from a paranoid schizophrenic illness long before the bombings. He called on psychiatrists who said Copeland had effectively turned into a robot, and that he had \"religious and persecutory delusions\".",

Aspinall, a casino owner and former friend of missing peer Lord Lucan, had also secretly struggled with leukaemia. He was a close friend of the late Sir James Goldsmith, who was a partner in the gaming clubs which helped to pay the running costs of his two loss-making zoo parks - Port Lympne and Howletts, near Canterbury. Aspinall stood as a Referendum party candidate in Folkestone and Hythe at the last general election, polling 4,188 votes against Michael Howard and also donated money to Neil Hamilton to fight his libel case. Last night his half-brother, James Osbourne said his two wild animal parks would continue to be run by the John Aspinall Foundation \"in the manner and philosophy of their founder\". The parks have been dogged by controversy after five zookeepers were killed in 20 years, three of them mauled to death by tigers. Yet Aspinall maintained his belief that keepers should be allowed to enter the enclosures where tigers roamed and bond with them. Aspinall said his philosophy was to encourage keepers to come into close contact with potentially dangerous animals. However, in 1980, he was forced to shoot two Siberian tigresses that killed two keepers at Howletts, and four years later a keeper was crushed to death by an Indian bull elephant in Port Lympne. In 1994, the head keeper at Howletts was killed by a Siberian tiger. The most recent victim was Darren Cockrill, 27, who was crushed by elephant La Petite in its enclosure at Port Lympne in February. In 1996, Aspinall won a high court case to maintain the controversial practice of keepers mingling with tigers, even though in May of that year, a boy was awarded \u00a3132,000 because his arm was ripped off by a chimpanzee at Port Lympne in 1989. Last year he said one of the most distressing aspects of his cancer was not the way it ravaged his appearance but the fact that he could no longer mingle with his animals. A lifelong gambler, he is said to have cleaned out the aristocracy in the 1960s and profits from this were used to fund his private passion, animals. With his first wins he bought a flat in Belgravia and built an enclosure in the garden for a tiger, two bears and a capuchin monkey.

      "bodyText": "Monsanto, the controversial American biotechnology company, claimed what it called an important legal victory in the United States yesterday. An appeal court overturned a $174.9m (\u00a3115m) award over licensing rights in genetic engineering of seeds. The California Court of Appeals overturned a 1998 jury award in favour of Mycogen, a seed company owned by Dow Chemical. In the original case, Mycogen had alleged that Monsanto had refused to give it timely access to gene technology which makes some plants resistant to herbicides and other chemicals. The appeals court also rejected the claim that Monsanto should license valuable genetically engineered material to Mycogen as part of an agreement dating back to 1989. Dow Chemical responded to the appeal court's decision by saying that it would take the case to the California Supreme Court. But Scarlet Foster, a spokeswoman for Monsanto, said that yesterday's decision had been \"a complete win\" for the company. Monsanto was taken over by Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn last year. Before the takeover it had developed a reputation for hard negotiating tactics over licensing and an aggressive acquisition strategy. But its share price fell sharply as it fell foul of a consumer backlash against genetically engineered foodstuffs. The company faces several other cases involving licensing rights for genetically modified agricultural products. Ms Foster said yesterday: \"When the first products of any hi-tech industry begin to get commercialised there are always questions to be resolved around patents.\" Yesterday's appeal court decision dates back to an earlier agreement between Monsanto and Lubrizol Genetics, a company that was subsequently bought by Mycogen. In the original trial, the jury held that Monsanto had witheld valuable information and said that it should pay damages equal to twice Mycogen's loss of future profits.",

All this takes the first three weeks of July, with only a couple of rest days and a few time trials, when the cyclists ride on their own. </p> <p>Eurosport usefully has a two-hour \"highlights\" programme each evening. And the clue to David's greatness lies in the mention of the two-hour highlights package. If the highlights take two hours (minus the numerous ad breaks for German tyres and Swedish beer-flavoured coffee, or coffee-flavoured beer, I can't tell), how long is the whole damn thing? Several hours each day is the answer. And David is there on his own, commentating on the whole thing. Imagine Murray Walker doing a whole Grand Prix on his own, without Jim Rosenthal or that guy in the pit lane to help out. Imagine David Coleman covering the entire London Marathon without Brendan Foster to cover him while he goes to the toilet. This will give you some flavour of David's task, except that he's in France and entirely dependent on someone else for the pictures we get to see, plus he has to do it every day for three weeks. </p> <p>So you wind up with commentary like this: \"And here we are with 150km to go across this beautiful part of France. You can just see Lance Armstrong in the yellow jersey there just having a drink. But if you look just there to the left you can see the Chateau Berbiguiere, which you may remember me talking about during the '93 tour as I stopped there for dinner and had the most delicious meal. And now we can see Jan Ulrich trying to lead a breakaway off the front, but the Linda McCartney Vegetarian Sausage team are going to try and haul them back.\" And so on. I'm not sure when he eats or drinks, or breathes for that matter. </p> <p>He approaches this Herculean struggle with an enthusiasm and background knowledge of the sport bordering on the insane. This is no bad thing, as, to be honest, there isn't a lot to talk about during a Tour stage. Sure, there are intermediate sprints, a climb or two, maybe a breakaway, and always the sprint finish, but most of the time it's a bunch of Lycra-clad foreigners cycling along in a densely-packed blob. Yes, they take turns at the front, occasionally pick up food or drinks, and a minute later throw the empty drink bottle at the crowd. Very infrequently you can see one of them peeing into an empty drink bottle before they chuck it into a hedge. </p> <p>That's more or less it, for a good half day, every day. But David isn't allowed to be quiet (I have an image of a Eurosport producer sitting there with a gun to keep him talking, except I doubt Eurosport can afford a gun. Or a producer). So he talks about the riders, their history in recent races, their teams, their sponsors, their lives. Then he talks about the tactics, the bikes, the tyres, the bearings and the valves. Then he talks about the route, the interesting and historic local towns it goes through, the local produce, how much he enjoyed eating and drinking the local produce the night before. Then he talks about what he had for breakfast, what he had for lunch, and what he might have for dinner. Then he talks again about dinner the night before. And just when you're beginning to worry that he's going to talk about his childhood or his favourite teacher from primary school, there's an intermediate sprint to drag us back to the cycling. </p> <p>My favourite moment came in the coverage of the recent Giro D'Italia, when, during a particularly bucolic portion, David told us he was going to be quiet so that we could listen to the beautiful birdsong. At that point, the director switched to an overhead shot, so we had 30 seconds of helicopter noise before we rejoined the race at ground level and David picked up his commentary again. </p> <p>And just when you think it couldn't get any better, Stephen Roche arrives. Stephen is the best Irish rider of all time, and is James Hunt to David's Murray Walker. His speciality is turning up during the mountain stages and criticising the riders for stopping to put a jumper on for the descent. In his day, apparently, a bin-liner or piece of cardboard sufficed. </p> <p>But it's David's show, hour after beautiful hour of it, and it's all that anyone should watch in the first three weeks of July. </p> <p>The Tour de France begins tomorrow</p>",

      "body": "<p>My father left home when I was 11 and since then my happiness has been governed by my mother's emotional state. I would often come home from school to find her in tears or drunk. As an adult I have witnessed her further crises, including years of binge drinking, a divorce, spells of agoraphobia, being unable to cope with her job and, for the past 15 years, the problems she has had looking after her own mother. But lately things have greatly improved for her - my grandmother is living happily in sheltered accommodation and mum has moved into a more easily managed bungalow. She rang recently though, and told me she had become agoraphobic again. Then my grandmother phoned in tears saying: \"I think your mother is heading for a breakdown.\" She said she didn't want me to think it was her own fault because of the years of stress of looking after her. I am now 11 weeks pregnant having had a near miscarriage earlier on (my mother is aware). I feel I have to be selfish and distance myself from these two demanding women. To be brutal, I just want them to stop bothering me. How can I acheive this without causing them too much distress? They both talk in veiled tones about suicide. Should I stop worrying and just let them get on with it?<br><br><b> Make a clean break</b><br></p> <p>Clearly you love your mother and grandmother but are they abusing that? Like you, my mother's emotional stability had a major impact on me. From the age of nine, I was her main confidante, mostly about her deep unhappiness and loneliness within a violent marriage. Like many children abused in this way, I ended up with what a counsellor later called \"an over-developed sense of responsibility\".</p> <p>I loved my mother (still do) but while we also enjoyed each other's company, her manipulation gradually became the major part of our relationship. For 20 years, I persisted in trying to \"fix\" her life, trying to help her to become less isolated and lonely. At 29, after running out of ideas and patience with her regular breakdowns, self-pity and empty apologies, I realised she was deliberately maintaining her own misery and would always resist any improvements.</p> <p>Thereafter, I saw her past behaviour in a very different light. She'd set me up several times with carefully planted suicide notes and verbal suicide threats during my teens when we lived alone together. I discovered she never gave my brothers any hint of unhappiness. My education had collapsed under the strain of carrying her, so the damage done has been far-reaching. She sabotaged any attempted discussion, refusing to take any responsibility for her own happiness and blaming anyone else she could for her problems.</p> <p>I wrote to her explaining the damage done over the years by her abusive behaviour and while I loved her, I could no longer be in her life. Within two years, I had broken free of her and moved to another country. We have no contact now at all.

      "bodyText": "Damir Dokic, the father of Australian Wimbledon competitor Jelena Dokic, was yesterday detained and interviewed by police after reports that he was drunk and abusive and smashed a journalist's telephone shortly after his daughter's victory on court number five. Mr Dokic, who has been dubbed the \"tennis father from hell\" after landing himself in trouble during tournaments on previous occasions, had been drinking heavily prior to the match and was then seen walking around Wimbledon waving a cross of St George and shouting slogans. As bemused tennis fans looked on, Mr Dokic approached the main press building where he became involved in a heated conversation with journalists. Shouting things such as \"the Women's Tennis Association are fascists and political\" and \"the Queen is for democracy, everything else in this country is fascist\", Mr Dokic is then reported to have smashed a journalist's mobile telephone before being taken away by officers to the police room. He was released without charge and officers escorted Mr Dokic out of the courts, but tournament organisers said that he would be free to return as he had not been charged with any offence. Last year, Mr Dokic hit the headlines after he staged a sit-down protest in the street moments after being ejected from a tennis tournament in Birmingham in which his daughter had been playing. He was accused of barracking his daughter's opponents during matches and later accused tournament organisers of being Nazis. Yesterday's outburst came as it was revealed that Wimbledon has become the first grand slam tournament to introduce a players-only rule in locker rooms following a request from the Women's Tennis Association, the governing body for women's tennis. It followed complaints from players about the presence of mothers in locker rooms prior to matches. Their influence over their daughters at tournaments has caused tension in locker rooms and the ban is to be extended to all the leading tennis tournaments. The Association of Tennis Professionals, which governs the men's game, has not asked for a similar ban and its players will be allowed to have one non-playing guest in locker rooms prior to matches. The WTA said yesterday: \"We have asked all grand slam events to respect our request. Despite reports to the contrary this decision was not targeted at mothers but all non-player parties, including coaches, family and friends.\" Some of the world's leading players, including Martina Hingis, who is constantly accompanied by her mother Melanie Molitor, and Anna Kournikova, whose mother Alla is an ever present in locker rooms, will be affected by the ban. The mothers watch all their daughters' matches, travel the world with them during the season, sit in on press conferences, and have been criticised for their forceful influence over them.

Germany, Switzerland, Sweden and Spain have no use for the plutonium and uranium that reprocessing spent fuel produces and realise storing it would be cheaper.</p> <p>The original Danish proposal demanded an immediate end to reprocessing but the resolution was amended to say discharges \"shall be reviewed as a matter of priority\" with a view to \"dry storage\".</p> <p>The rules of the Ospar convention mean a 75% majority is needed from the 15 member countries - achieved by the Danish resolution - to make a vote legally binding.</p> <p>But the rules also state if a country votes against, or abstains, it is not legally bound by the decision.</p> <p>In London, the Department of the Environment issued a statement pointing this out. \"It is a point of principle that Europe does not have the right to tell us whether we can reprocess or not,\" it said.</p> <p>BNFL was equally dismissive. It said: \"Reprocessing is a commercial matter between BNFL and its customers.\"</p> <p>UK delegates in Copenhagan tried to further water down the Danish proposal without success and issued a statement saying they were forced to abstain.</p> <p>In 1998, at a meeting of the Ospar convention in Sintra, Portugal, Britain and France had agreed to cut discharges to \"close to zero\" by 2020.</p> <p>A week ago officials published a plan of how this was to be achieved, hoping it would be enough to prevent a hostile vote in Copenhagan.</p> <p>Bridget Woodman from Greenpeace said: \"Even though the UK and France can rightly claim it is not legally binding it makes their position morally very difficult - they are going against the wishes of 12 neighbours who want this contamination to stop.\"</p> <p>The government is reviewing the options for the state-owned industry having already abandoned plans to part privatise it until after the election. The company's critics and some of its own executives believe its future lies in nuclear waste management rather than reprocessing.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Britain and France were told yesterday by 12 European neighbours to end reprocessing and so prevent further radioactive discharges into the sea. The 12 to nil vote, with Britain and France abstaining, was at the Ospar convention meeting in Copenhagan, which controls pollution in the north-east Atlantic, North sea and Irish sea. A spokesman for the Department of the Environment said the government would refuse to be bound by the decision. Four countries, with contracts with British Nuclear Fuels to reprocess spent nuclear fuel at the Thorp plant at Sellafield in Cumbria, backed the Danish resolution. Germany, Switzerland, Sweden and Spain have no use for the plutonium and uranium that reprocessing spent fuel produces and realise storing it would be cheaper. The original Danish proposal demanded an immediate end to reprocessing but the resolution was amended to say discharges \"shall be reviewed as a matter of priority\" with a view to \"dry storage\". The rules of the Ospar convention mean a 75% majority is needed from the 15 member countries - achieved by the Danish resolution - to make a vote legally binding. But the rules also state if a country votes against, or abstains, it is not legally bound by the decision. In London, the Department of the Environment issued a statement pointing this out. \"It is a point of principle that Europe does not have the right to tell us whether we can reprocess or not,\" it said. BNFL was equally dismissive. It said: \"Reprocessing is a commercial matter between BNFL and its customers.\" UK delegates in Copenhagan tried to further water down the Danish proposal without success and issued a statement saying they were forced to abstain. In 1998, at a meeting of the Ospar convention in Sintra, Portugal, Britain and France had agreed to cut discharges to \"close to zero\" by 2020. A week ago officials published a plan of how this was to be achieved, hoping it would be enough to prevent a hostile vote in Copenhagan. Bridget Woodman from Greenpeace said: \"Even though the UK and France can rightly claim it is not legally binding it makes their position morally very difficult - they are going against the wishes of 12 neighbours who want this contamination to stop.\" The government is reviewing the options for the state-owned industry having already abandoned plans to part privatise it until after the election. The company's critics and some of its own executives believe its future lies in nuclear waste management rather than reprocessing.",

Alan Milburn, the health secretary, is expected to announce today that ministers will accept recommendations from this new national hospital beds panel in all but exceptional circumstances. He regards the move as a decentralisation of power similar to Gordon Brown's decision in 1997 to devolve control of interest rates to the Bank of England's monetary policy committee. The scheme will be outlined by Mr Milburn in a speech to the NHS Confederation in Glasgow, preparing the way for publication of a new national plan for the health service at the end of next month. The independent panel will be \"tasked with ensuring the NHS achieves ministers' commitment for delivering more beds in the whole care system\". Downing Street sources said ministers were determined to get rid of procedures that contributed to the NHS losing 40,000 hospital beds between 1987 and 1997. Frequently proposals for hospital closures, mergers and reorganisations encountered local objections and were referred to Whitehall for resolution. Over the years decisions were taken on individual applications without an effective check on regional bed supply for patients in hospital and social care. \"We have had a patchwork of decisions with no national co-ordination,\" the source said. \"The budget and radical NHS reforms in the national plan will go a long way to delivering Alan Milburn's commitment to provide more beds in the health care system.\" The independent beds panel will make recommendations on all proposals for hospital reorganisations.

      "bodyText": "Annual rises in the minimum wage and a shake-up of the lower youth rates are set to be offered to union leaders in Labour's election manifesto. Stephen Byers, trade and industry secretary, signalled yesterday during discussions ahead of meetings next weekend that the government is prepared to beef up one of Labour's most popular policies. Agreeing an annual review by the low pay commission and looking again at the level for younger people, possibly counting 21-year-olds as adults, could win widespread popular support. Unions, led by Unison, want the main rate, due to go up 10p to \u00a33.70 an hour in October, increased to \u00a35, but Downing Street and the Treasury fear such a figure would cost jobs. Senior Labour figures hope that a deal can be reached to avoid a confrontation, after the party leadership and the unions failed to resolve conflicts over the contents of the party's planned second term manifesto, at a meeting which was later described by the unions as frustrating and bruising. But the party hierarchy did accept more than 200 amend ments from unions and constituencies to the six policy documents drafted by the party. Anxious to show that the policy forum process, pioneered by Neil Kinnock and the then general secretary Larry Whitty, is producing ideas from the grassroots, the leadership claimed yesterday that the acceptance of the amendments showed that the process was working. There were still more than 200 amendments rejected by the leadership, which are likely to be the subject of hard bargaining between now and the policy forum on July 7. Labour sources said the amendments accepted by the policy commission included new commitments to end the commercial exploitation of women; tighter controls on arms brokers, especially in sub-Saharan Africa; and the creation of a new criminal offence for UK citizens to bribe or seek to bribe officials when overseas. In a move that will delight overseas charity campaigners, the leadership has also accepted an amendment to give an increasing proportion of development resources to primary education. Party sources said that further amendments would be accepted in the final round of arm twisting before the forum gathers in Exeter. The party leadership admitted that yesterday's meeting meant that it still faced big challenges from the grassroots and the unions over such issues as electoral reform, asylum seeker vouchers, the level of the exchange rate, and EU information disclosure directives to workers. Some unions are also pushing for a restoration of the link between pensions and earnings. The AEEU engineering union is still pressing for the Bank of England to be given a dual mandate, which would mean that its interest rate policy was designed to create jobs, as well as to lower the rate of inflation. In a move that will be a relief to the party leadership, union sources were suggesting that they will not push hard to drop the party pledge to hold a referendum on electoral reform after the election. The referendum pledge is seen inside Downing Street as vital to retaining good relations with the Liberal Democrats ahead of the election, and encouraging anti-Tory tactical voting. One union source said: \"As long as the leadership don't try to play silly buggers over other issues, we won't rub their noses in it over a referendum. In reality we don't think the government will hold two referendums and they will hold only one - on the single currency\". Another source said the union initially pushing the idea of dropping the referendum, the GMB, had seen its support crumble away. The GMB still hopes that either the policy forum, or the later full conference in the autumn, will reiterate that the party will give backing in a referendum for the current first past the post system. The Transport and General Workers Union is demanding that the leadership drop, or soften, the current system of vouchers for asylum seekers. However, some unions are warning their colleagues not to risk a confrontation wit the leadership. A senior source in the AEEU engineering union said: \"We have a clear choice. Do we treat Tony Blair as if he is a Conservative prime minister, or do we recognise that he has delivered a lot for working people? \"The real enemy are the Tories. A year before the election, we have got to focus on that.\" The source added: \"The maturity of any future relationship between the party and the unions will depends on how we solve these problems.\"",

      "bodyText": "More than 18 years after their relatives died in the chill south Atlantic, the next-of-kin of sailors on the cruiser General Belgrano are to sue Britain for sinking it during the Falklands conflict. Lawyers in the Argentinian capital, Buenos Aires, announced yesterday that they will launch a case for damages at the European court of human rights on Tuesday on the grounds that the sinking violated the Hague convention on the conduct of war. Some 323 Argentinians died when the battleship with 1,093 men on board was sunk by a British submarine, the Conqueror, on May 2 1982 - the biggest single loss of life in the conflict. It was credited with keeping the rest of the Argentinian navy out of the fighting, which ended with a British task force driving Argentinian invaders out of the Falklands. It also led to a celebrated Official Secrets Act court case, in which a jury acquitted a civil servant, Clive Ponting, of passing information to an MP about the position and direction of the vessel when it was torpedoed 36 nautical miles (58 km) outside the 200-mile British-declared military exclusion zone around the Falklands. Yesterday Tam Dalyell, the Labour MP for Linlithgow, who mounted a long campaign on the issue in the 1980s, said the aim of the then prime minster, Margaret [now Lady] Thatcher, in authorising the attack was less to safeguard the British navy than to scupper a peace initiative launched by Peru. But the plan to sue was condemned as \"utterly preposterous and absurd\" by the Tory MP for Aldershot, Gerald Howarth. \"If they feel they have the right to sue us, then the British government should sue the Argentinian authorities for the injuries sustained to our troops.\" In Buenos Aires, lawyer Jorge Olivera, said: \"We are seeking indemnity for all the deaths\". The lawyers' written summary for the case, which has taken five years to plan, said: \"At no time did the Argentine cruiser enter the exclusion zone. \"On the contrary, in the early morning hours it had set a course for the Isla de los Estados, clearly opposite of steering toward the theatre of operations.\" Mr Olivera said the Argentinian government had failed to bring its own court case against Britain over the incident \"because of political interests\".",

Not only judges but lay magistrates and tribunal members will have to put the new act into operation. A wide range of rights will be protected, including the right to life, freedom from inhuman and degrading treatment, freedom of expression, and right to a fair trial. In deciding whether a right has been breached, courts will have to take account of Strasbourg case law, though they will not have to follow it slavishly. Judicial review cases in the high court - like the one brought by prisoner Gavin Mellor for the right to artificially inseminate his wife - are predicted to double from 300 a year to 600. Human rights cases are expected to cost an extra \u00a340m in legal aid. Prisoners, most of whom qualify for legal aid, have taken a large number of cases to Strasbourg, and are expected to be one of the main groups to invoke the act. Challenges by patients detained in mental hospitals are likely to be another fruitful source of court cases. The act is expected to have its biggest impact in the criminal law field, as has happened in Scotland, where the convention is already incorporated into law as a result of the act which brought devolution to Scotland. There was an outcry last February when Scottish judges ruled unlawful a key provision of the Road Traffic Act, which forces the owner of a car to say whether he was driving it at the time when an offence was committed, because it breached the privilege against self-incrimination. \"Postcode prescribing\", which denies expensive drugs to patients in one part of the country but not in others, could come under challenge. The act guarantees the right to life and forbids discrimination in the exercise of that right. Planned legislation to allow the detention of people with severe personality disorders indefinitely on the basis that they might commit a serious crime is certain to face a challenge. The home secretary, Jack Straw, predicted this week that local authorities would face a raft of claims. Judges are already warning lawyers not to bring far-fetched human rights challenges for fear of bringing the act into disrepute. Sex in jail The facts Conjugal visits, allowed in some countries, are forbidden in British jails - although gay sex is rife in prisons. There are stories of surreptitious sex during prison visits, though this must be difficult with CCTV cameras and prison guards hovering. The only other opportunity for heterosexual sex comes if prisoners are on home leave, which may be granted on compassionate grounds - to attend a funeral or if a relative, particularly a child, is ill, for example. Inmates of open prisons nearing release may go out daily to work, coming back at night; some may be allowed on occasion to stay at home for the night, according to a prison service spokeswoman.",

That, plus manic persistence and weird taste in spectacles, provided combustible material for a public persona ignited by fringe politics. As plain Joan Graham - Birdwood's maiden name - she would have remained just one more case history in the sturm und drang of the British far right. In a memorably fatuous observation in 1994, Judge Henry Pownall told Birdwood he accepted that she did not intend to stir up racial hatred. \"You are not a wicked old woman in that sense,\" he added. Birdwood had been convicted of distributing a pamphlet, which denied the holocaust, and proclaimed a Jewish conspiracy to subvert society.

They pointed out that in the various gaming clubs he had run over the years, he had probably done more than Karl Marx to bring about the redistribution of wealth and the ruination of the rich.</p> <p>Those in the \"anti\" lobby, who regarded James Bond's melodrama villains, Goldfinger and Dr No, as realistic characters in comparison, pointed to Aspinall's catalogue of beliefs - that the world's population would be better if culled by 2bn of the less intelligent; that Hitler was right about eugenics (though wrong about other matters); that everyone should feel himself to be a member of a tribe that was better than any other; that instinct and prejudice were more reliable guides to behaviour than reason; that, as a worshipper of the natural world, he worshipped earthquakes and plagues; and that he would glady sacrifice the life of his own children to save an endangered species.</p> <p>Aspinall was not a comfortable person to be with or to contemplate, except perhaps for a small coterie of fellow gamblers and financial pirates, who presumably had a clearer idea of when he was joking. Over the years, that coterie included Sir James Goldsmith and Lord \"Lucky\" Lucan. Aspinall and Goldsmith were rumoured to have been among the council of war which met to consider Lucan's future the day after he had experienced some alleged difficulty with a length of lead pipe and the skull of his children's nanny.</p> <p>Aspinall's world, though aspiring to the tenets of the jungle, was a hermetically sealed one of port and cigars, in which tigers, apes and gaming chips provided a self-prescribed danger and excitement in a little world surrounded, in his eyes, by the mediocre and mundane. The fact that it was usually his zoo employees rather than himself who were killed or mauled in pursuit of his theory of close \"bonding\" with wild animals - though he himself suffered in no small measure - was a component of the exotic equation of his life, which appeared to elude any sense of irony he may have possessed.</p> <p>Both Howletts and Port Lympne seemed to attract human disaster. Aspinall's own daughter, Louise, was bitten by a tiger cub and needed 15 stitches. A boy of 10 had his arm ripped off by a chimpanzee at Port Lympne, and was awarded \u00a3132,000 in damages. Bindu, an English bull elephant, crushed a \"bonding\" keeper to death.

Balkash, the offending tiger, was described by Aspinall as coming from a \"rather tricky line of tigers, the same line that produced Zeya, who killed two keepers 16 years ago.

But, at that time, it was illegal to attract rich foreign and British punters by setting up a casino in which gambling could take place for money; and there was still a strong religious and moral feeling against any relaxation of the law.

He searched out his real father in an old people's home and supported him for the rest of his life. But it may have added to a sense of the unreality of human relationships.

Concrete roofs soak up most of the radiation emitted by the masts with only very low levels absorbed by children inside the classroom, according to the study by the national radiological protection board. Pupils were found to face more radiation coming through the classroom window from masts more than 300 yards away than from one placed on the roof. The publication of the report follows a groundswell of worry about the possible long-term health implications of placing radio masts near schools and hospitals. Friends of the Earth, the Council for the Protection of Rural England and the Country Landowners Association have all fought to stop masts being put on top of hospitals, council flats and areas of outstanding national beauty. During mounting opposition to the effects of the rapidly growing mobile phone industry, one group of parents refused to let their children go to a junior school in Kent because of fears over radiation from a mast in the grounds. The NRPB carried out tests on 118 different points at 17 sites, including masts, known as base stations, near schools and outside offices and homes. The tests showed the average exposure to radiation was well within safety boundaries at just 0.002% of international guidelines. More than 25m mobile phones are in use in the UK but the figure is expected to double with the introduction of third-generation phones offering video pictures and internet options. Masts have sprouted up across the country to keep pace with the popularity of mobile phones but the total number is unclear. Unofficial estimates have put the figure at more than 35,000. More than 500 cash-strapped schools and dozens of hospitals and council flats have masts because of the lure of considerable rents. But an environment committee of the Scottish parliament earlier this year recommended telecom masts should require planning permission. Some local authorities are increasingly adopting a \"precautionary principle\", keeping masts away from schools, hospitals and residential areas. Simon Mann, one of the authors of the NRPB study, said: \"There has been huge public concern over exposure to radio waves from base stations, and there was a real need for someone to produce some independent data that could be held up for everyone to see. \"We chose places to investigate where people were concerned about masts but in all of them we found the levels of radiation were well within guidelines and not hazardous.\" Early results of the study were passed to the Independent Expert Group on Mobile Phones, chaired by a former government chief scientific adviser, Sir William Stewart. The group last month published a report calling for stricter planning controls on masts but stopped short of banning them from schools. Residents groups and councillors had complained they found it difficult to prevent the masts being put up. The NRPB called for a systematic study to examine thousands of locations across the UK and supported the Stewart report's recommendation that a database of masts should be established. The debate over masts follows vigorous scientific debate and inquiries into the safety of the mobile phones themselves. Sir William's inquiry found no evidence that mobiles damaged human health and no evidence they did not. Sir William said the widespread use of mobiles by children should be discouraged, but left it to parents to make an \"informed choice\".",

      "body": "<p>What has Mo Mowlam got in common with Robert Mugabe? Even less than usual this week - apart from an unusually large number of acquaintances who know how to load an Armalite rifle in the dark. The Cabinet Office minister is famously counter-intuitive and her renewed attack on the over-blown privileges of the royal family must fall into that category, albeit not for the reasons savagely denounced in the Daily Mail.</p> <p>After all, it is hardly surprising that she suggested they move into less grand digs and hinted at her own not-so-closet republicanism. Ms Mowlam said it all six years ago when the Mail reacted with equally proprietorial outrage: it dislikes anyone but the Mail exploiting the Windsors for political gain or profit. What is more, the royals have taken her advice, quietly modernising in all sorts of ways. It may increase their survival chances if they avoid over-irritating their increasingly undeferential \"subjects\" in what has long been a crowned republic.</p> <p>What is more interesting is that a New Labour minister should indulge in class politics in 2000, even in such a mild form. Half the cabinet is probably republican in instinct, but it is not done to say so, as Tony Blair's ardent monarchism makes plain.</p> <p>Mr Mugabe better represented the zeitgeist this week when he attacked Zimbabwe's white farmers because they are white. All former colonial powers feel vaguely guilty about the past (perhaps not Japan), it is a good button to press; but the former Marxist guerrilla leader could hardly attack the tobacco farmers as an economic elite since he has kept his regime afloat by awarding his Zanu-PF and army chums similar perks, at the expense of his increasingly disappointed urban working class.</p> <p>Sounds familiar? Well yes. Since free market economics won its branch of the cold war its precepts have been so widely embraced beyond the United States that the political analysis - not to mention rhetoric - which long sustained leftwing parties throughout the industrialised world (plus Zanu-PF) has rapidly atrophied.</p> <p>Into the rhetorical vacuum have come the politics of race and gender. So much so that Thatcher's children (people who grew up in the 80s and 90s) are bewildered or embarrassed by talk of conflicting interests and struggle between competing economic groups and classes.</p> <p>Inside the \"big tent\", the theory goes, everyone is wired and enjoys their own bit of cyberspace. The striking thing about race and gender is that they are much more easily reconciled with markets than the old politics of class. They are highly susceptible to fashionable versions of meritocracy.</p> <p>All those clever women, clever Asian entrepreneurs and Jesuit or Anglican-educated Guyanans (ex-choirboy David Lammy MP took his seat this week) fit into the globalised economy very nicely. It needs their brains! Anti-slavery campaigners in Britain 200 years ago and, later, in the US took the point. America's \"new south\" is built on the insight.</p> <p>But that leaves a lot of people behind, people who are harder to accommodate. Palestinians are a good example. The politics of the Holocaust, evident in growing numbers of Holocaust museums in Europe and the US, do not simply pay lip service to the horrors of the past, they help sustain the politics of the present.</p> <p>It is impossible to walk through Washington's Holocaust Museum, for example, without being aware both of the racial savagery it records and of the fact that the United States sustained its own brutal apartheid during the same period. That 30s park bench on display - stamped \"Jews Only\" - could also have been in Alabama. But that might have been too uncomfortable for the US capital, too close to home. The burgeoning Holocaust phenomenon serves to help keep American Jewry out of the melting pot, to bind it closer to faith and kin, closer to Israel, than might otherwise be possible. History, as always, is harnessed to contemporary needs.</p> <p>So with the rest of us. Labour politicians find it easier to engage in the symbolism of racial and gender injustice than mix it in class politics. Sexuality too. Even that doughty class warrior, John Prescott, will turn up (Mo too) for this weekend's Gay and Lesbian Pride celebrations. Once it would have been the Durham Miners' Gala.</p> <p>Many Labour politicians are uneasily aware of this.

      "bodyText": "What has Mo Mowlam got in common with Robert Mugabe? Even less than usual this week - apart from an unusually large number of acquaintances who know how to load an Armalite rifle in the dark. The Cabinet Office minister is famously counter-intuitive and her renewed attack on the over-blown privileges of the royal family must fall into that category, albeit not for the reasons savagely denounced in the Daily Mail. After all, it is hardly surprising that she suggested they move into less grand digs and hinted at her own not-so-closet republicanism. Ms Mowlam said it all six years ago when the Mail reacted with equally proprietorial outrage: it dislikes anyone but the Mail exploiting the Windsors for political gain or profit. What is more, the royals have taken her advice, quietly modernising in all sorts of ways. It may increase their survival chances if they avoid over-irritating their increasingly undeferential \"subjects\" in what has long been a crowned republic. What is more interesting is that a New Labour minister should indulge in class politics in 2000, even in such a mild form. Half the cabinet is probably republican in instinct, but it is not done to say so, as Tony Blair's ardent monarchism makes plain. Mr Mugabe better represented the zeitgeist this week when he attacked Zimbabwe's white farmers because they are white. All former colonial powers feel vaguely guilty about the past (perhaps not Japan), it is a good button to press; but the former Marxist guerrilla leader could hardly attack the tobacco farmers as an economic elite since he has kept his regime afloat by awarding his Zanu-PF and army chums similar perks, at the expense of his increasingly disappointed urban working class. Sounds familiar? Well yes. Since free market economics won its branch of the cold war its precepts have been so widely embraced beyond the United States that the political analysis - not to mention rhetoric - which long sustained leftwing parties throughout the industrialised world (plus Zanu-PF) has rapidly atrophied. Into the rhetorical vacuum have come the politics of race and gender. So much so that Thatcher's children (people who grew up in the 80s and 90s) are bewildered or embarrassed by talk of conflicting interests and struggle between competing economic groups and classes. Inside the \"big tent\", the theory goes, everyone is wired and enjoys their own bit of cyberspace. The striking thing about race and gender is that they are much more easily reconciled with markets than the old politics of class. They are highly susceptible to fashionable versions of meritocracy. All those clever women, clever Asian entrepreneurs and Jesuit or Anglican-educated Guyanans (ex-choirboy David Lammy MP took his seat this week) fit into the globalised economy very nicely. It needs their brains! Anti-slavery campaigners in Britain 200 years ago and, later, in the US took the point. America's \"new south\" is built on the insight. But that leaves a lot of people behind, people who are harder to accommodate. Palestinians are a good example. The politics of the Holocaust, evident in growing numbers of Holocaust museums in Europe and the US, do not simply pay lip service to the horrors of the past, they help sustain the politics of the present. It is impossible to walk through Washington's Holocaust Museum, for example, without being aware both of the racial savagery it records and of the fact that the United States sustained its own brutal apartheid during the same period. That 30s park bench on display - stamped \"Jews Only\" - could also have been in Alabama. But that might have been too uncomfortable for the US capital, too close to home. The burgeoning Holocaust phenomenon serves to help keep American Jewry out of the melting pot, to bind it closer to faith and kin, closer to Israel, than might otherwise be possible. History, as always, is harnessed to contemporary needs. So with the rest of us. Labour politicians find it easier to engage in the symbolism of racial and gender injustice than mix it in class politics. Sexuality too. Even that doughty class warrior, John Prescott, will turn up (Mo too) for this weekend's Gay and Lesbian Pride celebrations. Once it would have been the Durham Miners' Gala. Many Labour politicians are uneasily aware of this. Gordon Brown's welfare-to- work campaigns, for instance, rest on the earnest need to include the socially excluded, what we used to call the poor. Flexible labour markets need their labour too, albeit at \u00a33.50 an hour. It is not that New Labour does not hanker after the old certainties of class warfare, it is just that they are uneasy. The drive to end hunting with dogs is best understood as a bit of furtive toff-bashing, but is dressed up as animal welfare. Chancellor Brown's ill-judged foray into the Oxbridge selection process may reflect this unease. Labour's policies for funding higher education have not made it easier for Britain's Laura Spences.

Mellor was given a mandatory life sentence in January 1994 for the killing of George Sims, a 71-year-old grandfather, who was attacked as he walked home from a working men's club in Crewe, Cheshire.

His request to be allowed to donate sperm was first refused in November 1998 in a prison service letter which expressed concern about whether the marriage would remain stable once he was released.

Doreen and Neville Lawrence are suing police over their bungled investigation into the 1993 racist murder. Both sides have been in protracted negotiations about the amount and Scotland Yard want the case thrown out. Mrs Lawrence yesterday presented the former South African president Nelson Mandela with a lifetime achievement award at the South African high commission in London. After the ceremony the high commissioner, Cheryl Carolus, called for a settlement that was acceptable to the Lawrences. She said: \"We would like to see a resolution and would like to have a resolution where the Lawrence family will feel that their own personal grief has been addressed and that Stephen's spirit has been honoured in a manner that it ought to ... and in a manner which holds out fresh hope for people of colour in Britain and around the world. The Lawrences believe that a meeting with Mr Mandela in 1993, two months after Stephen's murder, was crucial and led to police arresting the five prime suspects for the killing, for which no one has been convicted. Ms Carolus said Mr Mandela was still monitoring developments in the Lawrences' six-year struggle for justice. \"Mr Mandela has been in touch with my office, [asking] where the case is, he has taken a really keen interest and is following it.\" Presenting Mr Mandela with the ethnic multicultural media award for lifetime achievement, Mrs Lawrence said that his intervention in the case in 1993 had been vital. She told him: \"I hold you very dear to my heart. Back in 1993, just after my son was killed, you were the only one of any stature who recognised the plight of my family and spoke out.\" She said that if they had not met in 1993 an inquiry into the murder would not have taken place. Lawyers acting for the Lawrences have issued writs for damages totalling \u00a3500,000 against the Metropolitan police and 26 officers, including the former commissioner, Sir Paul Condon. Mr Mandela, 81, said there was an increasing bond between the people of South Africa and Britain. \"When we see Doreen Lawrence we recognise our collective fate and our determination to stamp out racism wherever we find it,\" he said. After receiving his award Mr Mandela said: \"I'm sure that I can speak for all South Africans, black and white, that this award is recognition of their struggle for peace and democracy in our country.\"",

      "bodyText": "Nuclear energy in the UK is not \"twice as costly\" as other sources (Power failure, G2, June 28). The most modern nuclear power stations generate electricity at less than 2p a unit - fully competitive in today's modern electricity market. This includes provision for full decommissioning and other external costs. The entire article manages to discuss energy policy without even acknowledging the serious environmental threat of climate change now facing our planet. These dangers have been underlined just this month with the publication of the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution's report, Energy - the future climate. This acknowledges nuclear's key role in the UK's electricity supply and environmental performance, stating that it is \"the main source of carbon-free energy at present\". Andy Beckett attempts to dismiss the central part nuclear energy plays curbing Britain's greenhouse gas emissions in one sentence, stating that it is a \"sly claim\". The truth is that each year, nuclear energy in the UK saves the emission of about 65m tonnes of CO2. The awesome challenge of climate change requires a serious debate about the future of nuclear energy in the UK, as part of a balanced and diverse energy policy. Ray Hall Chairman, British Nuclear Industry Forum \u0095 Your report appeared at the same time as a new report in Sweden by the International Project for Sustainable Energy Paths, predicting that all nuclear power plants in Europe could be phased out by the year 2020.

For generations, Jewish children around the world have donated their pocket money to buy stamps to be pasted in the shape of a tree, earning a certificate on completion that their sapling is part of the Zionist project of making the desert bloom. Dozens of tour groups make a weekly pilgrimage, paying $10 to kneel in the dirt and plant their own tree to a background of songs, prayers and other ceremonies in JNF forests around Israel, as have visiting presidents and prime ministers. But yesterday Yehiel Leket, co-chairman of the JNF, which owns more than 90% of the land in Israel, admitted that saplings planted by visitors in a forest near the Jerusalem suburb of Ein Kerem suburb were ripped out moments later to make way for the next group of tourists on a similar mission. He claimed that it was an isolated incident. \"It is a few saplings in a new site. Altogether we plant in Israel 2.5m trees every year.

Ma'ariv said the plot had been planted as a memorial by the family of an American teenager, Assaf Green, who died aged 16. Mr Leket said the JNF was conducting an internal investigation. \"We will punish those responsible very severely, and we hope to convince the public abroad and in Israel that the JNF has credibility, and that nothing wrong has been done in terms of policy, and in terms of the respect we pay to individual donors.\" He denied the newspaper's allegation that the JNF was systematically uprooting saplings, for which it pays a nominal sum, and pocketing the bulk of the $10 donations.

Chancellor Wolfgang Sch\u00fcssel said last night that he would accept the plan proposed by Portugal to check whether the coalition was abiding by \"common European values\". But he berated the 14 other EU governments for failing to set a date to lift the sanctions. Portugal worked against the clock to reach an agreement before its six-month tenure of the EU presidency ends tonight. France, far more hardline on Austria, takes over tomorrow. Sanctions will continue while the three wise men monitor Austria's respect for \"the rights of minorities, refugees and immigrants\" and \"the evolution of the nature [of the Freedom party]\", a Portuguese statement said. It is widely assumed that the sanctions will be lifted in January, when Sweden takes over the EU helm. Mr Sch\u00fcssel said Austria's continuing diplomatic isolation was \"a dead-end street\", but called the Portuguese proposal \"progress which we recognise\". The European court of human rights in Strasbourg, which is not part of the EU, agreed to appoint three judges to report to the 14. Diplomats hope the scheme will be enough to head off Austria's threat to delay the reforms needed before the EU can expand and to ask its people to condemn their EU partners in a referendum. The French far-right leader Jean Marie Le Pen attacked the monitoring decision as \"scandalous\", saying EU governments were \"trying to claim a prerogative which was never agreed upon in any European treaty - that is, to censor a people's opinion\".",

      "body": "<p>This weekend brings something new for the voters of Mexico. Never before have they gone to the polling stations in the knowledge that the Institutional Revolutionary Party might actually lose the presidency it has held for 71 years.</p> <p>The last opinion surveys ahead of Sunday's election show the PRI candidate, Francisco Labastida, just a whisker ahead of the opposition challenger, Vicente Fox of the centre-right National Action Party, the PAN.</p> <p>If the polls are right about the tiny margin between the two men, great importance attaches to the decisions made on election day by the 15% of voters who told the pollsters they were still undecided.</p> <p>Also crucial could be those intending to vote for leftwinger Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the Democratic Revolution Party, the PRD, who lies a distant third in the opinion surveys. He has repeatedly refused to agree to an alliance with Mr Fox.</p> <p>Right up to the moment when campaigning ended by law on Wednesday, Mr Fox was courting and cajoling PRD supporters. If he ends up losing because Mr Cardenas draws away anti-PRI votes, Mr Fox declared, \"history will be a very severe judge of Cuauhtemoc\".</p> <p><b> Character attacks </b><br></p> <p>Very few commentators are willing to call the outcome - not least because no one is sure how truthful people have been with the pollsters. Carlos Elizondo of the think-tank Cide said the imponderables included: \"What the undecided voters will do; how many people lied because they were afraid to say they were voting against the PRI, or ashamed to say that they would; where it might rain and who that would affect.\"</p> <p>For the last two months the PRI has primed its unparalleled electoral machine to call in the votes all over the country. It has also set about trying to ruin the reputation of Mr Fox.</p> <p>Assisted by an increasing bias against the challenger in the media, the PRI has portrayed Mr Fox as an unpatriotic liar and closet authoritarian, as well as hinting at mental instability and impotence.</p> <p>The election, said another political analyst, Alfonso Zarate, is going to be a test pitting the apparatus of the PRI against people's general exasperation with this party. And it will test the \"marketing that made Fox into a plausible candidate\".</p> <p>Mr Fox, a former Coca-Cola executive who stands 6ft 6in in his favourite boots, is putting his faith in a tough-guy image, a campaign slogan proclaiming, \"we have already won,\" and those ardent pleas to Cardenas followers to abandon the veteran politician on his third doomed bid for the presidency.</p> <p>Election day will not necessarily end the cliff-hanger. A tight win by Mr Labastida would probably be contested by Mr Fox.</p> <p>Organised by a genuinely independent electoral body for the first time, this is a ballot where blatant fraud will be difficult. But the poll's fairness has already been questioned by international and national observers who say there is evidence of pre-election day irregularities favouring the governing party.</p> <p>These include mass donations in impoverished areas of building materials, bicycles and even washing machines, on the understanding that the recipients vote for the party. Federal anti-poverty programmes have been aggressively used to promote the PRI, and state sector workers have reported pressure to campaign for Mr Labastida, or risk their jobs.</p> <p>\"If Vicente Fox thinks there was fraud he's going to raise a lot of hell,\" said Adolfo Aguilar Zinser, one of the challenger's closest advisers who is tipped as his likely foreign minister.</p> <p>PRI speakers have also been trying to frighten people by saying that the opposition, if it won, would plunge the country into chaos. Mr Aguilar Zinser countered: \"We are not hostages of their stability, we are promoters of democracy, and if they fail to deliver democracy they fail to sustain stability. And if the international community sees it otherwise, tough.\"</p> <p><b> Few clues on issues </b><br></p> <p>But even Mr Aguilar Zinser conceded that it was difficult to tell if Mexicans would be in the mood for a post-poll protest aimed at forcing an annulment. \"If we don't have the support, then we will not do it, or we will do it badly.\"</p> <p>Also unpredictable is the reaction of the PRI if Mr Labastida loses. The party's own tradition of dirty tricks could make it hard to cry fraud credibly, but even if its rival gets a clear win, a septuagenarian political edifice built on clientalism and patronage does not disappear overnight.</p> <p>Most economic analysts, however, predict that the country will avoid a crisis. The private sector seems confident that whoever becomes president will abide by the macro-economic othodoxy championed by the outgoing administration of President Ernesto Zedillo. Forty per cent of the country's 100m people are still in poverty, but the budget deficit and inflation have been brought under control.</p> <p>Aside from the likelihood that economic management will continue to be cautious, there are few clues to how either candidate would handle other major issues. This is because the campaign has been fought almost exclusively on Mr Fox's character on the one hand, and on the other whether it can be healthy for the PRI to stay longer in the presidency.</p> <p>Little of substance, for instance, has been said by the contenders about the conflict in the southern state of Chiapas, still simmering five years after the Zapatista rebels staged a brief but dramatic uprising in the name of indigenous rights.</p> <p>Both candidates have promised to try to end the stalemate between the federal government and the Zapatistas, but neither has specified how.

      "bodyText": "This weekend brings something new for the voters of Mexico. Never before have they gone to the polling stations in the knowledge that the Institutional Revolutionary Party might actually lose the presidency it has held for 71 years. The last opinion surveys ahead of Sunday's election show the PRI candidate, Francisco Labastida, just a whisker ahead of the opposition challenger, Vicente Fox of the centre-right National Action Party, the PAN. If the polls are right about the tiny margin between the two men, great importance attaches to the decisions made on election day by the 15% of voters who told the pollsters they were still undecided. Also crucial could be those intending to vote for leftwinger Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the Democratic Revolution Party, the PRD, who lies a distant third in the opinion surveys. He has repeatedly refused to agree to an alliance with Mr Fox. Right up to the moment when campaigning ended by law on Wednesday, Mr Fox was courting and cajoling PRD supporters. If he ends up losing because Mr Cardenas draws away anti-PRI votes, Mr Fox declared, \"history will be a very severe judge of Cuauhtemoc\". Character attacks Very few commentators are willing to call the outcome - not least because no one is sure how truthful people have been with the pollsters. Carlos Elizondo of the think-tank Cide said the imponderables included: \"What the undecided voters will do; how many people lied because they were afraid to say they were voting against the PRI, or ashamed to say that they would; where it might rain and who that would affect.\" For the last two months the PRI has primed its unparalleled electoral machine to call in the votes all over the country. It has also set about trying to ruin the reputation of Mr Fox. Assisted by an increasing bias against the challenger in the media, the PRI has portrayed Mr Fox as an unpatriotic liar and closet authoritarian, as well as hinting at mental instability and impotence. The election, said another political analyst, Alfonso Zarate, is going to be a test pitting the apparatus of the PRI against people's general exasperation with this party. And it will test the \"marketing that made Fox into a plausible candidate\". Mr Fox, a former Coca-Cola executive who stands 6ft 6in in his favourite boots, is putting his faith in a tough-guy image, a campaign slogan proclaiming, \"we have already won,\" and those ardent pleas to Cardenas followers to abandon the veteran politician on his third doomed bid for the presidency. Election day will not necessarily end the cliff-hanger. A tight win by Mr Labastida would probably be contested by Mr Fox. Organised by a genuinely independent electoral body for the first time, this is a ballot where blatant fraud will be difficult. But the poll's fairness has already been questioned by international and national observers who say there is evidence of pre-election day irregularities favouring the governing party. These include mass donations in impoverished areas of building materials, bicycles and even washing machines, on the understanding that the recipients vote for the party. Federal anti-poverty programmes have been aggressively used to promote the PRI, and state sector workers have reported pressure to campaign for Mr Labastida, or risk their jobs. \"If Vicente Fox thinks there was fraud he's going to raise a lot of hell,\" said Adolfo Aguilar Zinser, one of the challenger's closest advisers who is tipped as his likely foreign minister. PRI speakers have also been trying to frighten people by saying that the opposition, if it won, would plunge the country into chaos. Mr Aguilar Zinser countered: \"We are not hostages of their stability, we are promoters of democracy, and if they fail to deliver democracy they fail to sustain stability. And if the international community sees it otherwise, tough.\" Few clues on issues But even Mr Aguilar Zinser conceded that it was difficult to tell if Mexicans would be in the mood for a post-poll protest aimed at forcing an annulment. \"If we don't have the support, then we will not do it, or we will do it badly.\" Also unpredictable is the reaction of the PRI if Mr Labastida loses. The party's own tradition of dirty tricks could make it hard to cry fraud credibly, but even if its rival gets a clear win, a septuagenarian political edifice built on clientalism and patronage does not disappear overnight. Most economic analysts, however, predict that the country will avoid a crisis. The private sector seems confident that whoever becomes president will abide by the macro-economic othodoxy championed by the outgoing administration of President Ernesto Zedillo. Forty per cent of the country's 100m people are still in poverty, but the budget deficit and inflation have been brought under control. Aside from the likelihood that economic management will continue to be cautious, there are few clues to how either candidate would handle other major issues. This is because the campaign has been fought almost exclusively on Mr Fox's character on the one hand, and on the other whether it can be healthy for the PRI to stay longer in the presidency. Little of substance, for instance, has been said by the contenders about the conflict in the southern state of Chiapas, still simmering five years after the Zapatista rebels staged a brief but dramatic uprising in the name of indigenous rights. Both candidates have promised to try to end the stalemate between the federal government and the Zapatistas, but neither has specified how. Mr Fox has dropped his earlier boast that he could settle this issue in 15 minutes. The Zapatistas, led by Subcomandante Marcos, have pledged not to interfere with the setting up of polling stations in their areas of influence, while declaring a preference for the doomed PRD. Conservative challenger with leftish fans Vicente Fox's candidacy is a threat to the PRI because he has broadened his appeal beyond his centre-right party, the PAN, moving away from his own conservative Catholicism to build a movement around the single issue of change. For this he owes much to two prominent leftwingers who joined his inner circle: Adolfo Aguilar Zinser , a senator and academic, and the author Jorge Castaneda . At national level, \"this is the first time in Mexican history that power might be transferred through the ballot box. This has never occurred: not recently, not a long time ago, not never,\" says Mr Castaneda, who insists that Mr Fox is now firmly in the centre. Mr Aguilar Zinser likes to portray his candidate as an adventurer jumping the PRI's perilous traps: \"Mr Fox is the Indiana Jones of Mexican politics.

There has never been anyone in Mexican politics before able to cope with all of that.\" If he reaches his goal, the senator argues, Mr Fox's acceptability with the right will guarantee a smooth transition . The closest comparison to the present situation was election night 12 years ago, when early results showed gains for the opposition candidate, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas. The lead was reversed after the government-controlled electoral computer system collapsed.",

      "body": "<p>On May 6, 1993, the bodies of three eight-year-old boys were found in Robin Hood Hills Park in West Memphis, Arkansas. They had been raped, tortured and mutilated - one of the boys' penises had the skin removed - before bleeding to death. There was no blood at the crime scene, no murder weapons found, and no footprints or any other physical evidence usually associated with such crime.</p> <p>A month later, a five-hour undocumented interrogation by Arkansas police produced a statement from a 17-year-old boy with an IQ of 79, Jesse Miskelly Jr, that he had watched Damien Echols, 18, and Jason Baldwin, 16, ritually rape, mutilate and murder the boys as part of a Satanist ceremony. Miskelly Jr later retracted his statement, and despite a lack of physical evidence that linked any of the boys to the crime, the three were found guilty.</p> <p>The only witnesses were two small girls who claimed to have overheard Echols boasting about killing the children. Crucial forensic evidence that might have acquitted Echols, Baldwin and Miskelly had been lost or overlooked by Arkansas police. Echols is facing death by lethal injection and Baldwin and Miskelly are serving life sentences without parole.</p> <p>Soon after the success of their documentary Brother's Keeper, film-maker Joe Berlinger and his working partner Bruce Sinofsky read a report in the New York Times about three devil-worshipping teens who had killed three boys.</p> <p>\"It was at the time of the Jamie Bulger case,\" says Berlinger, \"and I was fascinated by the idea that young people could be so alienated as to do something so evil. The idea was to make a portrait of disaffected youth, rather like a real-life River's Edge. I had read all the reports and assumed that the three boys were guilty, but later found out how local journalists had just talked to the families of the victims and discovered how much prejudice there is in Arkansas, which is real Bible Belt - mention the devil and everybody runs for cover.</p> <p>\"The first time I saw Damien in court, I had already imbued him with this sense of evil, and I remember thinking, 'Ooh, look at that spooky guy'. Two weeks later we interviewed him for the film, and he was intelligent, articulate, sympathetic, very narcissistic - a teenager who didn't understand the jam he was in.</p> <p>\"As I found out more about the story, nothing added up. The police weren't doing their job. I remember feeling very embarrassed that I had fallen victim to the hype surrounding [Damien] and realised that was how the community was reacting. There was a lazy media around the case who felt it easier to feed the Damien monster than do any real probing; a Bible-thumping part of the world with a literal belief in the idea of heaven and hell; and a crime so horrific that the community needed closure as soon as possible.\"</p> <p>In terms of standard legal procedure, the trial was a farce. The strongest argument, and a theme that runs through the film, is that Damien was considered guilty because he wore black, listened to Metallica, had a vague knowledge of witchcraft and the Wicca religion that governs it and was articulate and curious in an inarticulate, closed-minded world.</p> <p>\"Damien Echols in New York or LA would be one among a thousand, and would most likely have been acquitted in those parts of the country,\" says Berlinger. \"But in Arkansas he was guilty because of the way he looked.\"</p> <p>The entire trial hung on the Miskelly confession, but it could not be used in a second trial for Echols and Baldwin because Miskelly would not agree to substantiate it. \"There was a ceremonial change of venue for Echols' and Baldwin's trial to 100 miles away from West Memphis to ensure the jury wasn't biased, but that's a joke in this day and age,\" says Berlinger. \"The local papers printed Miskelly's confession a few days before the trial, so the jury were already decided.\"</p> <p>Few people could watch the film and not strongly suspect that a miscarriage of justice had taken place. But with such a subject there is a moral question as to how the material should be presented.</p> <p>\"A documentary is necessarily subjective, and we've been criticised for adding music and trying to give it a narrative, but it's structured around what we thought happened. You can't have absolute, objective truth when you're dealing with a subject like this, but you can aim to be emotionally truthful. The most important truth is that there are far too many questions surrounding the case to put this guy to death.\"</p> <p>Berlinger returned to the case in a recent film, Paradise Lost 2: Revelations. For him, the Damien Echols affair has been a professional choice that turned into an ethical one. \"We certainly didn't have a great social agenda when we made the first film. It was originally intended as a portrait of a subculture. But on the second film we were on a quest to find justice. The whole thing was emotionally draining: I had just become a father when we started shooting, and I was looking at photographs of the mutilated boys all day before going home to my little girl at night. The last thing I wanted to do was a sequel, which is rarely creatively satisfying, but we wanted to see justice. It's ironic that I'm now working on the sequel to The Blair Witch Project.\"</p> <p>From documenting a horrific saga of a modern-day witch-hunt to making a follow-up to the most celebrated horror movie of recent times may seem a strange move. \"Film-making is film-making,\" explains Berlinger of his decision. \"I'm critical of anyone who wants to ghettoise it into documentary or fiction, and I've always considered myself a film-maker-storyteller first and a journalist second.</p> <p>\"In documentary you can't put words in people's mouths but you're very conscious of dramatic structure and a certain shooting style while needing to stick to what's truthful. So the transmission to features isn't such a big deal - it's a different way of working, but the director of a movie is hired to give a vision, to be the keeper of a flame. It's just odd that it's Blair Witch, which was a faked documentary anyway.\"</p> <p>Berlinger was hired at the behest of Artisan Entertainment's studio executives who had seen the Paradise Lost documentary and admired it; he was also suggested by Blair Witch's directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez, who had based much of their celebrated website on the one for Paradise Lost.</p> <p>\"I was called up to pitch an idea to Artisan, but I think they already had me in mind,\" says Berlinger. \"It was Thanksgiving, and I was sent three scripts. I passed on all of them as they were too similar to the first film. Lightning never strikes twice, and I had no intention of being the guy who killed the franchise. So Artisan asked me what I'd do with the subject. I wrote a script over a weekend, and by mid-February we were in production.\"</p> <p>Berlinger isn't at liberty to say much about the film, but a few clues have emerged. There are five central characters who get lost in the woods, three men and two women, one of whom is a Wiccan and upset at the way witches have been portrayed in the first film. The title is suffixed \"Book of Shadows\", after the Wiccan book of incantations and spells. The group is involved in searching for traces of Rustin Parr who murdered seven children in the 40s.</p> <p>There is no doubt that Berlinger is bringing his own ideas to the project. Taking on the sequel to a successful film is, of course, a dangerous business, but Berlinger is confident. \"Blair Witch did three things well that I aim to keep,\" he says. \"Firstly, it blurred the lines of fiction and reality, and I'm hoping to do that in an original and innovative way. Secondly, it had a psychological unravelling of the characters, as things start out light-hearted and get more and more serious. Thirdly, it was goreless - what you didn't see evoked fear. I've used a little more visuals to heighten the scares, but still created a movie without much blood.\"</p> <p>The director of the most chilling documentary of recent times looks set to go his own way with Book of Shadows. \"It couldn't follow in the first movie's footsteps, but it had to have enough mythology so that the Blair Witch fans get something out of it. My favourite childhood film series was Planet of the Apes - they were all connected, but each one didn't depend on the previous movie. That's my plan. But I think it's scary as hell, and a few people are going to be surprised.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Paradise Lost: The Child Murders at Robin Hood Hills is screening at 12.10am, tomorrow, on FilmFour.</p> <p>\u0095 <a href=\"http://www.blairwitch.com\">Blair Witch 2: Book of Shadows</a> is due for release on October 27.</p>",

      "body": "<p>In 1963, Nelson Pereira dos Santos, already an established director in Brazil, made a film called Barren Lives. It was a kind of Brazilian Grapes of Wrath, set in the north-east of the country and made for $25,000. The same year, that region, notorious for oppressive landowners and destitute peasants, was the setting for The Guns, by Ruy Guerra, a tale of murderous landowners. A year later Glauber Rocha's Black God, White Devil. The latter, described as \"a frenzied parable of desperation\", poetically exposed the pitiful agrarian situation in the north-east.</p> <p>The world was now alerted to a powerful new film movement: Cinema Novo. Dos Santos is recognised as its father; Rocha gave it its slogan: \"the aesthetics of hunger\". In 1969, Rocha introduced western filmgoers to the figure of the cangaceiro, the avenging social bandit, in Antonio das Mortes. </p> <p>Cinema Novo was fiercely committed to righting the wrongs of society. Maturing during the term of the progressive President Goulart, within two years Cinema Novo faced obliteration following the military coup of April 1964, which introduced 21 years of military dictatorship. Barren Lives was banned; Rocha was arrested, though Black God, White Devil, critically acclaimed at Cannes, gave him some measure of temporary immunity. </p> <p>In the teeth of dictatorship, Cinema Novo began to deal with urban problems. The Big City (1966) by Carlos Diegues, described the plight of rural migrants to the capital. Rocha made Land in Anguish, shot, as many of the films were, by cinematographer Luis Carlos Barreto. Land in Anguish was an allegorical treatment of a theme repeated by others: the ambiguous role of middle-class intellectuals. The central figure is a corrupt politician continually switching sides. It was smuggled to Cannes and won the International Critics' prize. </p> <p>Dos Santos made Hunger for Love (1968), a bitter analysis of the failed Brazilian revolution expressed by a wife-swapping couple. </p> <p>The movement proved to possess an astonishing vitality, with the directors displaying a capacity to change style as the occasion - and military repression - demanded. If European audiences detected a pretentiousness at times in the heavy use of allegory and myth, it was no affectation: this was often the only means by which the directors could outwit censors. </p> <p>An internal military coup in December 1968 brought with it a new dictator, General M\u00e9dici, and Cinema Novo entered its cannibalistic/tropicalist phase. In 1971 Dos Santos made what is regarded as a masterwork of subversion: the delirious How Tasty Was My Little Frenchman, a metaphor for the cultural genocide European colonists inflicted on the Americas.

      "bodyText": "In 1963, Nelson Pereira dos Santos, already an established director in Brazil, made a film called Barren Lives. It was a kind of Brazilian Grapes of Wrath, set in the north-east of the country and made for $25,000. The same year, that region, notorious for oppressive landowners and destitute peasants, was the setting for The Guns, by Ruy Guerra, a tale of murderous landowners. A year later Glauber Rocha's Black God, White Devil. The latter, described as \"a frenzied parable of desperation\", poetically exposed the pitiful agrarian situation in the north-east. The world was now alerted to a powerful new film movement: Cinema Novo. Dos Santos is recognised as its father; Rocha gave it its slogan: \"the aesthetics of hunger\". In 1969, Rocha introduced western filmgoers to the figure of the cangaceiro, the avenging social bandit, in Antonio das Mortes. Cinema Novo was fiercely committed to righting the wrongs of society. Maturing during the term of the progressive President Goulart, within two years Cinema Novo faced obliteration following the military coup of April 1964, which introduced 21 years of military dictatorship. Barren Lives was banned; Rocha was arrested, though Black God, White Devil, critically acclaimed at Cannes, gave him some measure of temporary immunity. In the teeth of dictatorship, Cinema Novo began to deal with urban problems. The Big City (1966) by Carlos Diegues, described the plight of rural migrants to the capital. Rocha made Land in Anguish, shot, as many of the films were, by cinematographer Luis Carlos Barreto. Land in Anguish was an allegorical treatment of a theme repeated by others: the ambiguous role of middle-class intellectuals. The central figure is a corrupt politician continually switching sides. It was smuggled to Cannes and won the International Critics' prize. Dos Santos made Hunger for Love (1968), a bitter analysis of the failed Brazilian revolution expressed by a wife-swapping couple. The movement proved to possess an astonishing vitality, with the directors displaying a capacity to change style as the occasion - and military repression - demanded. If European audiences detected a pretentiousness at times in the heavy use of allegory and myth, it was no affectation: this was often the only means by which the directors could outwit censors. An internal military coup in December 1968 brought with it a new dictator, General M\u00e9dici, and Cinema Novo entered its cannibalistic/tropicalist phase. In 1971 Dos Santos made what is regarded as a masterwork of subversion: the delirious How Tasty Was My Little Frenchman, a metaphor for the cultural genocide European colonists inflicted on the Americas. Ironically, while it survived the military censorship, it was banned at Cannes for excessive nudity. There are extraordinary contradictions in the survival of Cinema Novo. It was the military regime that created, in 1966, a National Film Institute and Embrafilme - which provided state funding. Carlos Diegues was one of the beneficiaries of the military government's desire that the cinema should commemorate the 150th anniversary of the country.

      "byline": "Michael Atkinson",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Marlene Dietrich was one of the most fabulously, absurdly beautiful actresses of the Hollywood Golden Age and, arguably, its most contrived - manufactured from soft lighting, make-up, dental work and stylised visuals. Perhaps it was this combination that made her second only to Garbo in terms of raw allure and the capacity for seducing a movie camera.</p> <p>It's easy to gaze upon her and wonder whether she was even verifiably human, her eyes were that cat-shaped, her cheekbones that high, her skin that sheeny. But true Dietrich fans - and I have counted myself one since I was 11 and saw Shanghai Express for the first time - are also made ardent by the halo of loose blonde curls that surrounds her sharp, alien gorgeousness; the meaty, petulant throb in her voice (rarely, in those first films, ever rising above a murmur); the womanly warmth in those eyes; the affectionate angle of her crooked, lipsticked smirk.</p> <p>Dietrich wasn't just a sex goddess - she was an enrapturing cataract of contradictions, a female ideal made flesh. To watch her in one of her Josef von Sternberg-directed films of the 30s is to see movies become the illumination of our dreams. </p> <p>Hollywood in the 30s was full of beautiful immigrants, of whom Garbo was the most famous (without being the most popular, by a long shot), and all imports, from Hedy Lamarr to Charles Boyer to Ingrid Bergman, had their looks, personas, biographies and often their names rehabilitated by the studio publicity mills.</p> <p>Dietrich, though, was a special case: no one in the history of movies had their on-screen life so tightly controlled as Dietrich did in her first years in La La Land. The controller was the Brooklyn-born von Sternberg, with whom Dietrich undoubtedly had some kind of intimate relationship, the precise nature of which we'll never know. Those films - Morocco (1930), Dishonoured (1931), Shanghai Express (1932), Blonde Venus (1932), The Scarlet Empress (1934) and The Devil Is a Woman (1935) - are masterpieces of vapour, shadow and lust, and in them Dietrich glows like a full moon. </p> <p>Already a reputable auteur in Hollywood, von Sternberg came into his own as a master of stylised opulence, heartbreaking kitsch and visual form (after seeing Morroco, which was shot in California, the Moroccan emir reputedly asked the director when he had visited Africa with his cameras); and Dietrich was, for those five years, the centre of his cyclone.</p> <p>Never has an actress been attended to so meticulously as Dietrich was by von Sternberg. As a result it is as though she's not \"acting\" but following the lead of the man behind the camera in a sexualised ballet. When von Sternberg was watching, Dietrich radiated. Her performances are like breathless renditions of a silent song, and her visual presence, which is what von Sternberg knew was 99% of what she was to us, is an end in itself. Often a film stops dead to look at her as she basks in its attention. There's no pretence of realism; they both knew they were constructing sublime, ridiculous sandcastles. </p> <p>It really all started for both of them with The Blue Angel (1930), which von Sternberg went to Germany to direct, and which transformed Dietrich from middling German ing\u00e9nue and cabaret act to a worldwide star. But The Blue Angel is asymptomatic; designed and shot like a gritty German Kammerspielfilm, it is like the work of another director. Indeed, the Josef-Marlene relationship probably started between it and the journey later that year to the sunny Paramount lot in Burbank for the making of Morocco.</p> <p>In The Blue Angel, Dietrich is plump, painted crudely and rarely seen in close-up, a far cry from the serpentine vixen she would become once she and von Sternberg had the Hollywood machine at their disposal. (When, exactly, she had her molars removed to sink her cheeks in further is anyone's guess.)</p> <p>An indisputably great film, The Blue Angel is a tough-skinned morality tale in which Dietrich (as a heartless dance-hall tramp) carelessly ruins the lives of men foolish enough to want her. This paradigm would not return for Dietrich and von Sternberg until their last film, The Devil Is a Woman. Between The Blue Angel and Morocco, Dietrich became the camera's fixation and she deepened into an iconic womanhood, saddened and wearied by her experiences with men. </p> <p>She was nearly 30 when Morocco was released and, though she appeared timeless, her character had the unmistakable substance of a grown woman. (How odd - and rare - that quality seems today.) The plots of such films are classic silliness: in some exotic locale, world-weary Marlene would, against her best instincts, fall for a legionnaire or spy or soldier and sacrifice herself for him. These were exercises in amour fou, in which even the most experienced woman on the globe (and in Shanghai Express Dietrich was the all-knowing queen of demi-mondaines) could become a selfless martyr to romance. </p> <p>As such, the von Sternberg films have aged into a fecund campiness, though as with many things deemed hilarious with the passing of time, there's a crazy, misty beauty to those films that cannot be laughed away: Morocco's sweaty evensong; Dishonoured's dry mockery of the Mata Hari legend (taken too seriously a year later in Garbo's Mata Hari); the berserk imagery of Blonde Venus (Dietrich in a gorilla suit and blonde afro wig) sutured to a tear-jerking scenario; Shanghai Express's lavishly faux exoticism; The Scarlet Empress's phallic expressionism; The Devil is a Woman's veil-draped lustiness. The silky scrim of cigarette smoke was the axiom of the films. </p> <p>Without von Sternberg's obsessive presence and visual adoration, Dietrich never resonated in quite the same way again; she lost the hypnotising mixture of carnality, mystery and kindness that von Sternberg conjured. Outside von Sternberg's mini-worlds, she was merely ravishing, charming and game for anything. </p> <p>The Dietrich season at the National Film Theatre, which starts tomorrow, begins with the von Sternberg classics (after a few rarely seen 1929 German silents, The Woman Men Yearn For and I Kiss Your Hand Madame), then surveys her subsequent voyage into more or less typical Hollywood genre movies.</p> <p>Frank Borzage's Desire (1936) plops Dietrich down delicately into a jewel-thief/romance bit of screwball, pairing her with her Morocco co-star Gary Cooper.

      "bodyText": "Marlene Dietrich was one of the most fabulously, absurdly beautiful actresses of the Hollywood Golden Age and, arguably, its most contrived - manufactured from soft lighting, make-up, dental work and stylised visuals. Perhaps it was this combination that made her second only to Garbo in terms of raw allure and the capacity for seducing a movie camera. It's easy to gaze upon her and wonder whether she was even verifiably human, her eyes were that cat-shaped, her cheekbones that high, her skin that sheeny. But true Dietrich fans - and I have counted myself one since I was 11 and saw Shanghai Express for the first time - are also made ardent by the halo of loose blonde curls that surrounds her sharp, alien gorgeousness; the meaty, petulant throb in her voice (rarely, in those first films, ever rising above a murmur); the womanly warmth in those eyes; the affectionate angle of her crooked, lipsticked smirk. Dietrich wasn't just a sex goddess - she was an enrapturing cataract of contradictions, a female ideal made flesh. To watch her in one of her Josef von Sternberg-directed films of the 30s is to see movies become the illumination of our dreams. Hollywood in the 30s was full of beautiful immigrants, of whom Garbo was the most famous (without being the most popular, by a long shot), and all imports, from Hedy Lamarr to Charles Boyer to Ingrid Bergman, had their looks, personas, biographies and often their names rehabilitated by the studio publicity mills. Dietrich, though, was a special case: no one in the history of movies had their on-screen life so tightly controlled as Dietrich did in her first years in La La Land. The controller was the Brooklyn-born von Sternberg, with whom Dietrich undoubtedly had some kind of intimate relationship, the precise nature of which we'll never know. Those films - Morocco (1930), Dishonoured (1931), Shanghai Express (1932), Blonde Venus (1932), The Scarlet Empress (1934) and The Devil Is a Woman (1935) - are masterpieces of vapour, shadow and lust, and in them Dietrich glows like a full moon. Already a reputable auteur in Hollywood, von Sternberg came into his own as a master of stylised opulence, heartbreaking kitsch and visual form (after seeing Morroco, which was shot in California, the Moroccan emir reputedly asked the director when he had visited Africa with his cameras); and Dietrich was, for those five years, the centre of his cyclone. Never has an actress been attended to so meticulously as Dietrich was by von Sternberg. As a result it is as though she's not \"acting\" but following the lead of the man behind the camera in a sexualised ballet. When von Sternberg was watching, Dietrich radiated. Her performances are like breathless renditions of a silent song, and her visual presence, which is what von Sternberg knew was 99% of what she was to us, is an end in itself. Often a film stops dead to look at her as she basks in its attention. There's no pretence of realism; they both knew they were constructing sublime, ridiculous sandcastles. It really all started for both of them with The Blue Angel (1930), which von Sternberg went to Germany to direct, and which transformed Dietrich from middling German ing\u00e9nue and cabaret act to a worldwide star. But The Blue Angel is asymptomatic; designed and shot like a gritty German Kammerspielfilm, it is like the work of another director. Indeed, the Josef-Marlene relationship probably started between it and the journey later that year to the sunny Paramount lot in Burbank for the making of Morocco. In The Blue Angel, Dietrich is plump, painted crudely and rarely seen in close-up, a far cry from the serpentine vixen she would become once she and von Sternberg had the Hollywood machine at their disposal. (When, exactly, she had her molars removed to sink her cheeks in further is anyone's guess.) An indisputably great film, The Blue Angel is a tough-skinned morality tale in which Dietrich (as a heartless dance-hall tramp) carelessly ruins the lives of men foolish enough to want her. This paradigm would not return for Dietrich and von Sternberg until their last film, The Devil Is a Woman. Between The Blue Angel and Morocco, Dietrich became the camera's fixation and she deepened into an iconic womanhood, saddened and wearied by her experiences with men. She was nearly 30 when Morocco was released and, though she appeared timeless, her character had the unmistakable substance of a grown woman. (How odd - and rare - that quality seems today.) The plots of such films are classic silliness: in some exotic locale, world-weary Marlene would, against her best instincts, fall for a legionnaire or spy or soldier and sacrifice herself for him. These were exercises in amour fou, in which even the most experienced woman on the globe (and in Shanghai Express Dietrich was the all-knowing queen of demi-mondaines) could become a selfless martyr to romance. As such, the von Sternberg films have aged into a fecund campiness, though as with many things deemed hilarious with the passing of time, there's a crazy, misty beauty to those films that cannot be laughed away: Morocco's sweaty evensong; Dishonoured's dry mockery of the Mata Hari legend (taken too seriously a year later in Garbo's Mata Hari); the berserk imagery of Blonde Venus (Dietrich in a gorilla suit and blonde afro wig) sutured to a tear-jerking scenario; Shanghai Express's lavishly faux exoticism; The Scarlet Empress's phallic expressionism; The Devil is a Woman's veil-draped lustiness. The silky scrim of cigarette smoke was the axiom of the films. Without von Sternberg's obsessive presence and visual adoration, Dietrich never resonated in quite the same way again; she lost the hypnotising mixture of carnality, mystery and kindness that von Sternberg conjured. Outside von Sternberg's mini-worlds, she was merely ravishing, charming and game for anything. The Dietrich season at the National Film Theatre, which starts tomorrow, begins with the von Sternberg classics (after a few rarely seen 1929 German silents, The Woman Men Yearn For and I Kiss Your Hand Madame), then surveys her subsequent voyage into more or less typical Hollywood genre movies. Frank Borzage's Desire (1936) plops Dietrich down delicately into a jewel-thief/romance bit of screwball, pairing her with her Morocco co-star Gary Cooper. Richard Boleslawski's The Garden of Allah (1936) is the kind of picture in which you can feel Dietrich hunger for the perversity and adoration of von Sternberg. Instead, she seems lost in sanctimony, though it is also one of the 30s' loveliest colour films, and insanely melodramatic. Jacques Feyder's Knight Without Armour (1937) fares better, with Robert Donat helping out Dietrich's Russian countess during the Red October of 1917. By the time of Destry Rides Again (1939) and The Flame of New Orleans (1941) Dietrich had become domesticated, playing inexplicably Teutonic-accented saloon floozies in comic westerns that took pains to bring the zeppelin of her legend crashing to earth. She survived for decades in Hollywood playing ageing variations on the wayward German woman glowering at the world, culminating in her fake gypsy fortune-teller in Orson Welles' Touch of Evil (1958). In the real world, Dietrich fared somewhat better - or worse, depending on how you look at it - becoming so reclusive in her old age that she insisted her old friend (and Judgment at Nuremberg co-star) Maximilian Schell could not photograph her for his 1984 documentary Marlene. Dietrich lived in the cheap seats of cultural memory as a gay icon, both as a bisexual (she wore men's tuxedos as early as 1930, and in Morocco she kissed a woman deep on the lips for no better reason than to outrage the censors) and as a middle-aged, cigarette-hoarse nightclub star easily imitated by drag queens. It's a grotesque injustice, given the fierce glamour of those early films, and Dietrich's slow-boiling presence in them. She was the quintessential cinematic woman, as beautiful as could be withstood by mortal man, and well aware that all we know of her is what could be photographed. The rest was irrelevant. \u0095 The Marlene Dietrich season is at the NFT July 1-30. Box office: 020 7928 3232.",

      "body": "<p>When Thelma &amp; Louise was released in 1991 it inspired a stream of abuse from the (mostly) male reviewers. Many of the critics found the tale of two women who go on the run after shooting dead a rapist a little close to the bone. They claimed it had \"an explicit fascist theme\" and was \"degrading to men\". </p> <p>The film's scriptwriter, Callie Khouri, saw it differently. \"Bad guys get killed in every goddam movie that gets made. And that guy [the rapist] was the bad guy and he got killed. It was only because a woman did it that there was any controversy at all. If a guy had come out and saved their asses and shot that guy and said, 'Run, quick,' do you think there would have been a fucking moment of controversy?\" </p> <p>For women trying to make it, over the years, as producers and studio executives in Hollywood, there has been something of a similar reaction. According to a new book, Is That a Gun in Your Pocket?, by journalist Rachel Abramowitz, there has been no shortage of guys who weren't pleased to see women taking control, and no shortage of guys ready to tell female would-be producers, \"Run, quick,\" and leave the shooting to them. </p> <p>Abramowitz's book is already in the bestseller lists in Los Angeles (one place above Stepping Up to Power: The Political Journey of American Women, by Harriett Woods) and could not have arrived at a more timely moment. Last week, producer Paula Weinstein (The Fabulous Baker Boys, Fearless) received Variety's Hall of Fame award and made the pointed comment that it was nice to be recognised, even though she had not produced many big box-office films.</p> <p>And this week a new series of Beggars and Choosers, a television satire on the entertainment industry, will feature a ruthlessly ambitious vice president of development, Lori Volpone, played by Charlotte Ross, who fulfils many stereotypes about the cut-throat style of the woman executive who makes it in the business. </p> <p>The message for women producers is that either they get criticised for not making enough record-breaking hit movies or they are seen as hard-faced schemers prepared to trample in their stilettos over the backs of male executives to reach the top. </p> <p>What Abramowitz found by talking to 150 of the women executives, directors and players who have made it in the film business was that many had had to ignore or tolerate quite a lot of the type of behaviour that would have had Thelma and Louise reaching for their Magnums. Women had found that their job interview for an entr\u00e9e into the business often started with \"take off your clothes\" and that when they had been given the job, their boss's first call of the day was to pass on this information: \"I'm holding my big, veiny dick in my hand.\" Would that Mae West was still around to make the appropriate riposte. </p> <p>Gloria Steinem is among many who have praised the book, saying that it \"exposes the working conditions in America's dream factory, a reality more cautionary than anything it puts on film\". As if to prove her point, director Martha Coolidge recounts being told when she applied to the New York University graduate film school: \"You can't be a director, you're a woman. You're wasting your time and your parents' money.\" </p> <p>When Coolidge was finally allowed to direct her first film she was told by the head of the company: \"I want you to know that we must have naked breasts in this movie four times... I don't care how you do it. I just want naked breasts.\" Coolidge told him she did not have a problem with that as long as she could do it her way, which she duly did, making the film Valley Girl for $350,000 and watching it gross $17m.</p> <p>Women directors remain the exception. In the decade between 1983 and 1992, a period in which many barriers appeared to be being broken down by and for women in the film industry, only 81 of the 1,794 features made were directed by women. No woman has ever won an Oscar for best director and only two have been nominated - Lina Wertmuller in 1977, and Jane Campion in 1993. </p> <p>The role of women in film and the relative ways in which male and female actors are treated is a different subject, although Abramowitz quotes Meryl Streep addressing the Screen Actors Guild first national women's conference: \"I'm barely able to contain a guffaw when a reporter asks me what drew me to a role, as though there is a rainbow of well-written leading female roles.\" </p> <p>Her speech coincided with the publication of research that showed that 71% of all roles in feature films went to men. It might seem that not too much has changed if this week's box-office returns in the US are anything to go by: Shaft, Mission: Impossible 2, Gladiator, Gone in 60 Seconds. The only film with a plethora of strong female roles would seem to be Chicken Run. </p> <p>But the spectrum of opinion quoted in the book is broad. Sue Mengers, the veteran agent, is quoted as saying: \"Power is still alien to women. They don't feel it is proper. Men get on top in sex and we are still scared of turning them off... There are now as many mediocre women working in our industry as there are men.\" </p> <p>Sherry Lansing, who in 1980 became the first woman studio head when she was made president of Fox, tells Abramowitz: \"This is going to make me really unpopular with women's lib, but they [male executives] never came on to me in a way that was abusive or I couldn't handle. I was a single woman. Nobody ever threw me down on the couch.\" </p> <p>What did upset Lansing was the New York Times headline when she was appointed to the top job: \"Sherry Lansing, former model, named head of Fox Productions.\" She was already 36 at the time of the appointment and she had last been a Max Factor model when she was 22. The years with Columbia as vice president of production (Kramer vs Kramer; The China Syndrome) and as MGM's vice president of creative affairs were forgotten in the face of the chance to slip in a reference to her modelling days. </p> <p>Paula Weinstein recalled: \"There was hellish competition amongst the women. We all tended to compete with each other and to think of ourselves on the ladder for the one woman job at the studio, rather than coming together and saying, 'Now, how do we forge ourselves as a group?' \"</p> <p>Barbra Streisand suggests, when talking about her time as director of the 1983 film Yentl, that \"these people call me an egotist because they can't handle a woman having this much control\". She was producer, director, writer and star of the film. When Yentl was not nominated for an Oscar as best picture and Streisand not nominated as best director, her supporters picketed the ceremony in LA with placards reading: \"Oscar at 56 - is he still a closet chauvinist?\" </p> <p>One woman television executive I spoke to about Abramowitz's book and about the role of women executives in the industry said that she thought women now had more power in television than in film. \"I think television is more democratic than film,\" she said, \"although, like film, it is still a white man's world. There are some really good television directors out there but there is still a shortage of women. It is a boys' club.\"</p> <p>Women have certainly achieved a higher profile on the management side of television than in film. My source said that she reckoned one reason for this was the need to finish programmes on time because they had to be shown on television in a specific slot and could not be delayed meant that people behaved in a more professional and democratic fashion than in film, where the final cut could always be delayed or negotiated. </p> <p>Rachel Abramowitz, who is based in Los Angeles and has covered the film industry mainly for Premiere magazine, concludes her eight-year-long study with the observation that Titanic was \"the biggest woman's picture of all time\". Some 60% of the audience were women, and 72% of those who went more than once were female - 64% of them under 25. </p> <p>Sherry Lansing said of the Titanic script when she first saw it: \"This is one of the strongest feminist pieces I've ever read in my life.\" And Abramowitz's book ends by affirming that women audiences are taken more seriously than they were 10 or 20 years ago. But as writer and director Nora Ephron is quoted: \"If you're not helped by men, you don't get anywhere in this business because men run it, women don't.\" </p> <p>It was Mae West, of course, who gave the book its title and it's worth noting that in 1926, aged 34, it was Mae West who not only wrote the play Sex, but also produced and directed the show, which made it to Broadway.</p> <p>She was jailed for 10 days on charges of obscenity but emerged to direct again the following year, this time a play about homosexuals called Drag. It was a hit in New Jersey but West was told not to risk bringing it to Broadway. From there, she went on to a film career that gave us everything from I'm No Angel and Night After Night to Myra Breckinridge and Sextette. Doubtless, were she alive today, she would be more than puzzled that three quarters of a century after she had cut her producing and directing teeth, women are still so far removed from the power lines. </p> <p>\u0095 Is That a Gun in Your Pocket? by Rachel Abramowitz is published by in the US by Random House, price $26.95.</p> <p><strong>Breaking into the boys' club</strong></p> <p><strong>Studio executives</strong></p> <p>In 1980 Sherry Lansing became the first woman studio head when she was appointed president of 20th Century Fox.

      "bodyText": "When Thelma &amp; Louise was released in 1991 it inspired a stream of abuse from the (mostly) male reviewers. Many of the critics found the tale of two women who go on the run after shooting dead a rapist a little close to the bone. They claimed it had \"an explicit fascist theme\" and was \"degrading to men\". The film's scriptwriter, Callie Khouri, saw it differently. \"Bad guys get killed in every goddam movie that gets made. And that guy [the rapist] was the bad guy and he got killed. It was only because a woman did it that there was any controversy at all. If a guy had come out and saved their asses and shot that guy and said, 'Run, quick,' do you think there would have been a fucking moment of controversy?\" For women trying to make it, over the years, as producers and studio executives in Hollywood, there has been something of a similar reaction. According to a new book, Is That a Gun in Your Pocket?, by journalist Rachel Abramowitz, there has been no shortage of guys who weren't pleased to see women taking control, and no shortage of guys ready to tell female would-be producers, \"Run, quick,\" and leave the shooting to them. Abramowitz's book is already in the bestseller lists in Los Angeles (one place above Stepping Up to Power: The Political Journey of American Women, by Harriett Woods) and could not have arrived at a more timely moment. Last week, producer Paula Weinstein (The Fabulous Baker Boys, Fearless) received Variety's Hall of Fame award and made the pointed comment that it was nice to be recognised, even though she had not produced many big box-office films. And this week a new series of Beggars and Choosers, a television satire on the entertainment industry, will feature a ruthlessly ambitious vice president of development, Lori Volpone, played by Charlotte Ross, who fulfils many stereotypes about the cut-throat style of the woman executive who makes it in the business. The message for women producers is that either they get criticised for not making enough record-breaking hit movies or they are seen as hard-faced schemers prepared to trample in their stilettos over the backs of male executives to reach the top. What Abramowitz found by talking to 150 of the women executives, directors and players who have made it in the film business was that many had had to ignore or tolerate quite a lot of the type of behaviour that would have had Thelma and Louise reaching for their Magnums. Women had found that their job interview for an entr\u00e9e into the business often started with \"take off your clothes\" and that when they had been given the job, their boss's first call of the day was to pass on this information: \"I'm holding my big, veiny dick in my hand.\" Would that Mae West was still around to make the appropriate riposte. Gloria Steinem is among many who have praised the book, saying that it \"exposes the working conditions in America's dream factory, a reality more cautionary than anything it puts on film\". As if to prove her point, director Martha Coolidge recounts being told when she applied to the New York University graduate film school: \"You can't be a director, you're a woman. You're wasting your time and your parents' money.\" When Coolidge was finally allowed to direct her first film she was told by the head of the company: \"I want you to know that we must have naked breasts in this movie four times... I don't care how you do it. I just want naked breasts.\" Coolidge told him she did not have a problem with that as long as she could do it her way, which she duly did, making the film Valley Girl for $350,000 and watching it gross $17m. Women directors remain the exception. In the decade between 1983 and 1992, a period in which many barriers appeared to be being broken down by and for women in the film industry, only 81 of the 1,794 features made were directed by women. No woman has ever won an Oscar for best director and only two have been nominated - Lina Wertmuller in 1977, and Jane Campion in 1993. The role of women in film and the relative ways in which male and female actors are treated is a different subject, although Abramowitz quotes Meryl Streep addressing the Screen Actors Guild first national women's conference: \"I'm barely able to contain a guffaw when a reporter asks me what drew me to a role, as though there is a rainbow of well-written leading female roles.\" Her speech coincided with the publication of research that showed that 71% of all roles in feature films went to men. It might seem that not too much has changed if this week's box-office returns in the US are anything to go by: Shaft, Mission: Impossible 2, Gladiator, Gone in 60 Seconds. The only film with a plethora of strong female roles would seem to be Chicken Run. But the spectrum of opinion quoted in the book is broad. Sue Mengers, the veteran agent, is quoted as saying: \"Power is still alien to women. They don't feel it is proper. Men get on top in sex and we are still scared of turning them off... There are now as many mediocre women working in our industry as there are men.\" Sherry Lansing, who in 1980 became the first woman studio head when she was made president of Fox, tells Abramowitz: \"This is going to make me really unpopular with women's lib, but they [male executives] never came on to me in a way that was abusive or I couldn't handle. I was a single woman. Nobody ever threw me down on the couch.\" What did upset Lansing was the New York Times headline when she was appointed to the top job: \"Sherry Lansing, former model, named head of Fox Productions.\" She was already 36 at the time of the appointment and she had last been a Max Factor model when she was 22. The years with Columbia as vice president of production (Kramer vs Kramer; The China Syndrome) and as MGM's vice president of creative affairs were forgotten in the face of the chance to slip in a reference to her modelling days.

Breaking into the boys' club Studio executives In 1980 Sherry Lansing became the first woman studio head when she was appointed president of 20th Century Fox. In 1984 she joined up with Stanley Jaffe to form an independent production company and, when Jaffe was appointed president of Paramount Communications in 1990, she became chairman of Paramount Pictures Motion Picture Group. Dawn Steel became Paramount's production chief in 1984 and president of Columbia Pictures three years later. Directors Last year, women directors accounted for 10.2% of the total days worked, compared with 4% in 1985. The first woman film director - as well as the first director, male or female, to bring a narrative film to the screen - was Alice Guy-Blach\u00e9 (1873-1968) who directed, produced and/or supervised nearly 300 films in her lifetime. The first woman to be nominated for the Best Director Oscar was Italian film-maker Lina Wertmuller, for Seven Beauties, in 1977. (She had started out working as assistant director to Federico Fellini on 8\u00bd.) The only other female nominee has been Jane Campion for The Piano in 1993 - a film which had already won the Palme d'Or at Cannes. Penny Marshall was the first woman to direct a movie, Big, to gross more than $100m. Martinique-born Euzhan Palcy was the first black woman film-maker to direct a feature-length Hollywood film with A Dry White Season, in 1989. Writers The first truly powerful woman Hollywood scriptwriter was Frances Marion, a one-time war correspondent who became Mary Pickford's \"official scriptwriter\" in the silent era. Marion won Oscars for The Big House in 1930 and The Champ in 1931.

      "body": "<p>Vittorio Gassman, who has died aged 77, had a career on stage, screen and television which spanned five decades and won him popularity and critical acclaim well beyond his native Italy, partly because he made frequent theatrical tours and appeared in many non-Italian films. He became more admired in later life - by directors like Robert Altman - than he had been in his brief Hollywood career in the 1950s. </p> <p>Gassman had started out, quite promisingly, as a sportsman in his hometown of Genoa, but quickly decided to put his athletic prowess, good looks and prodigiously mellifluous speaking voice to work in the theatre. After dropping out of the National Academy of Dramatic Art, he made his stage debut at the age of 20 in Milan. </p> <p>With the ending of the second world war, he began to be noticed, appearing in several of the Luchino Visconti productions which were revolutionising Italian theatre and widening horizons after the cultural blackout of the fascist years. In 1949, he played Alfieri's Orestes for the first time, in a production which was one of Visconti's most extravagant exploits - with a full orchestra back stage and its hero dressed in a fabulously bejewelled costume. </p> <p>In the 1950s, he stubbornly continued to court the tragic muse, flattered by the applause of audiences who seemed not to care if his good looks and splendid voice were insufficient to carry roles like Peer Gynt. But his popularity in Italy continued to increase, and, with Luigi Squarzina, he formed the Teatro d'Arte Italiano, for which be played Hamlet. Though again lacking depth, his striking stage manner won over a new generation of theatregoers. Later, his second wife Shelley Winters, was to comment (after their divorce), \"He gave Hamlet with too much emphasis on the ham.\" </p> <p>Gassman continued to indulge in tragic roles, including an Othello, in which he alternated Iago and the Moor - the irony he brought to Iago suggested he was perhaps more suited to comedy than tragedy. In 1957, he persuaded one of Visconti's former assistants, Francesco Rosi, to help him direct a film of the stage production of the Hugo-Sartre Kean. His identification with the role of Edmund Kean was to haunt his image for most of his career. </p> <p>As actor-manager, Gassman had continued to choose appealing roles, but, after a successful season appearing in Irma La Douce in 1959, and, in the same year, winning national popularity by exploiting his over-the-top versatility on a television series, Il Mattatore (something between \"matador\" and \"madman\"), he decided the time had come to launch a long-cherished project, his Teatro Popolare Italiano (TPI), which made him one of Italian television's first nationwide stars. </p> <p>The idea was to build a tent theatre mobile enough to tour up and down Italy, but the massive steel structure, which his architect built in the Villa Borghese gardens in Rome, turned out to be unmovable. The opening production, in 1960, was Manzoni's Adelchi, a heavyweight poetic classic, which enabled Gassman to show off his flamboyant thespian qualities - but which frankly bored audiences. </p> <p>Later the same year, he tried to pander to more popular taste by taking the company to Milan to premiere a new play written for him by one of Italy's great humorous writers, Ennio Flaiano, co-scriptwriter of Fellini's La Dolce Vita. The play, A Martian In Rome, was a variation on the theme of the ennui of Roman society life. It was a flop in Milan, and Gassman never took it to Rome, where the unfortunate tent theatre had become a costly white elephant. Undaunted, he fell back on the kind of anthology-recital he could put together in a hurry and tour cheaply between films. This style also offered him a convenient intellectual alibi in times when everyone was trying to take art to the masses. He called the recital Il Gioco Degli Eroi (Playing The Hero), and this was the show that Peter Daubeny brought to the Aldwych in 1963. The London reviews were mostly favourable, particularly appreciating the self-irony in Gassman's parody of Italian operatic acting. The waiters in the chic new Italian restaurants of swinging London treated him like royalty. </p> <p>Gassman had played in films quite early on, and won attention as Casanova in Riccardo Freda's Il Cavaliere Misterioso (1943). In the immediate postwar period, he was the handsome scoundrel in Giuseppe De Santis's neo-realist melodrama Bitter Rice (1948), in which he was first seen on international screens. </p> <p>His first wife had been Nora Ricci, the daughter of one of Italy's leading stage actors of the times - and it was whispered that this may have helped him to start his stage career. The gossip columnists were later to hint that his second marriage, to Shelley Winters, was also motivated by ambition, this time for a career in Hollywood - though probably Gassman never really aimed at settling in America. </p> <p>Nonetheless, his experience as a Hollywood actor, and his good English, did help him to get one of his first serious film roles, as the only Italian star in the cast of King Vidor's War And Peace (1956), produced by Dino De Laurentiis in Rome. For the same producer, he also played in Richard Fleischer's Barabbas (1962). </p> <p>Gassman's career as a popular movie star really took off when he appeared in what are generally considered the best Italian comedies of those years, if not of all time, two directed by Mario Monicelli, I Soliti Ignoti (Big Deal On Madonna Street, 1958) and L'Armata Brancaleone (1965), and Dino Risi's Il Sorpasso (1962). Not only did this last film launch a genre - a variation in comic terms of what neo-realism had more starkly reflected of postwar Italy - but it also created for Gassman the prototype of a tragi-comic anti-hero - the bombastic, extrovert, no-holds-barred Italian of the economic miracle years. </p> <p>At this time, his popularity was only rivalled by that of Alberto Sordi, as a more Roman version of the same kind of negative, but simpatico, character. Dino De Laurentiis had great intuition when he teamed Gassman and Sordi, as soldiers of the first world war, one Milanese, one Roman, in Monicelli's La Grande Guerra, which shared the Golden Lion prize at Venice in 1959 with a Rossellini film. </p> <p>In the English-speaking cinema, Gassman was at his best working with Robert Altman in films (not, it is true, among the director's finest) like A Wedding (1978) and Quintet (1979). At the Venice festival in 1996, he was seen in Barry Levinson's Sleepers, beside stars like Robert de Niro and Dustin Hoffman. Gassman and Hoffman were both given Golden Lions for life achievement. </p> <p>Gassman had often revealed an autobiographical streak in his work on stage, in films and even as a writer - as in his first novel, Luca Dei Numeri (1965). His autobiography, optimistically entitled A Great Future Behind Me, was published in 1981. He was unquestionably the greatest Italian verse speaker of his time, as shown by his late-night readings on RAI-TV of The Divine Comedy, with comments worthy of the most erudite of Dante scholars. </p> <p>Gassman's swan song, or serata d'addio, the farewell performance which Italian actors of distinction were always expected to give, began in 1996. The show was on the lines of the recital he had been giving ever since the times of the TPI, either alone or surrounded by actor friends and intellectual cronies. He performed his favourite pieces, ranging from Sophocles to Shakespeare, from Kafka to Gregory Corso and Pasolini, touring it from Trieste to Palermo, and varying the formula - although he preferred that of the simulated TV talk show. </p> <p>In 1999, RAI gave Gassman the chance to do a last real television show, a new edition of the Mattatore which had brought him fame in the mid-50s - but the times had changed, and the ratings were low. Unlike another Italian ladykiller of his generation, Marcello Mastroiannni, he had difficulty in adapting to life over 70. Serious nervous breakdowns kept him off the stage and screen for long periods, though he always bounced back with enthusiasm and an energy almost equal to that of his earlier years. In this, he was helped by his fourth wife, Diletta. </p> <p>Gassman is survived by two daughters from his first and second marriages, by Alessandro, a popular young movie star, from his marriage to Juliette Meyniel, and by a son from his fourth marriage. </p> <p>\u0095 Vittorio Gassman, actor, born September 1 1922; died June 29 2000</p>",

Though again lacking depth, his striking stage manner won over a new generation of theatregoers. Later, his second wife Shelley Winters, was to comment (after their divorce), \"He gave Hamlet with too much emphasis on the ham.\" Gassman continued to indulge in tragic roles, including an Othello, in which he alternated Iago and the Moor - the irony he brought to Iago suggested he was perhaps more suited to comedy than tragedy. In 1957, he persuaded one of Visconti's former assistants, Francesco Rosi, to help him direct a film of the stage production of the Hugo-Sartre Kean. His identification with the role of Edmund Kean was to haunt his image for most of his career. As actor-manager, Gassman had continued to choose appealing roles, but, after a successful season appearing in Irma La Douce in 1959, and, in the same year, winning national popularity by exploiting his over-the-top versatility on a television series, Il Mattatore (something between \"matador\" and \"madman\"), he decided the time had come to launch a long-cherished project, his Teatro Popolare Italiano (TPI), which made him one of Italian television's first nationwide stars. The idea was to build a tent theatre mobile enough to tour up and down Italy, but the massive steel structure, which his architect built in the Villa Borghese gardens in Rome, turned out to be unmovable. The opening production, in 1960, was Manzoni's Adelchi, a heavyweight poetic classic, which enabled Gassman to show off his flamboyant thespian qualities - but which frankly bored audiences. Later the same year, he tried to pander to more popular taste by taking the company to Milan to premiere a new play written for him by one of Italy's great humorous writers, Ennio Flaiano, co-scriptwriter of Fellini's La Dolce Vita. The play, A Martian In Rome, was a variation on the theme of the ennui of Roman society life. It was a flop in Milan, and Gassman never took it to Rome, where the unfortunate tent theatre had become a costly white elephant. Undaunted, he fell back on the kind of anthology-recital he could put together in a hurry and tour cheaply between films. This style also offered him a convenient intellectual alibi in times when everyone was trying to take art to the masses. He called the recital Il Gioco Degli Eroi (Playing The Hero), and this was the show that Peter Daubeny brought to the Aldwych in 1963. The London reviews were mostly favourable, particularly appreciating the self-irony in Gassman's parody of Italian operatic acting. The waiters in the chic new Italian restaurants of swinging London treated him like royalty. Gassman had played in films quite early on, and won attention as Casanova in Riccardo Freda's Il Cavaliere Misterioso (1943). In the immediate postwar period, he was the handsome scoundrel in Giuseppe De Santis's neo-realist melodrama Bitter Rice (1948), in which he was first seen on international screens. His first wife had been Nora Ricci, the daughter of one of Italy's leading stage actors of the times - and it was whispered that this may have helped him to start his stage career. The gossip columnists were later to hint that his second marriage, to Shelley Winters, was also motivated by ambition, this time for a career in Hollywood - though probably Gassman never really aimed at settling in America. Nonetheless, his experience as a Hollywood actor, and his good English, did help him to get one of his first serious film roles, as the only Italian star in the cast of King Vidor's War And Peace (1956), produced by Dino De Laurentiis in Rome. For the same producer, he also played in Richard Fleischer's Barabbas (1962). Gassman's career as a popular movie star really took off when he appeared in what are generally considered the best Italian comedies of those years, if not of all time, two directed by Mario Monicelli, I Soliti Ignoti (Big Deal On Madonna Street, 1958) and L'Armata Brancaleone (1965), and Dino Risi's Il Sorpasso (1962). Not only did this last film launch a genre - a variation in comic terms of what neo-realism had more starkly reflected of postwar Italy - but it also created for Gassman the prototype of a tragi-comic anti-hero - the bombastic, extrovert, no-holds-barred Italian of the economic miracle years. At this time, his popularity was only rivalled by that of Alberto Sordi, as a more Roman version of the same kind of negative, but simpatico, character. Dino De Laurentiis had great intuition when he teamed Gassman and Sordi, as soldiers of the first world war, one Milanese, one Roman, in Monicelli's La Grande Guerra, which shared the Golden Lion prize at Venice in 1959 with a Rossellini film. In the English-speaking cinema, Gassman was at his best working with Robert Altman in films (not, it is true, among the director's finest) like A Wedding (1978) and Quintet (1979). At the Venice festival in 1996, he was seen in Barry Levinson's Sleepers, beside stars like Robert de Niro and Dustin Hoffman. Gassman and Hoffman were both given Golden Lions for life achievement. Gassman had often revealed an autobiographical streak in his work on stage, in films and even as a writer - as in his first novel, Luca Dei Numeri (1965). His autobiography, optimistically entitled A Great Future Behind Me, was published in 1981. He was unquestionably the greatest Italian verse speaker of his time, as shown by his late-night readings on RAI-TV of The Divine Comedy, with comments worthy of the most erudite of Dante scholars. Gassman's swan song, or serata d'addio, the farewell performance which Italian actors of distinction were always expected to give, began in 1996. The show was on the lines of the recital he had been giving ever since the times of the TPI, either alone or surrounded by actor friends and intellectual cronies. He performed his favourite pieces, ranging from Sophocles to Shakespeare, from Kafka to Gregory Corso and Pasolini, touring it from Trieste to Palermo, and varying the formula - although he preferred that of the simulated TV talk show. In 1999, RAI gave Gassman the chance to do a last real television show, a new edition of the Mattatore which had brought him fame in the mid-50s - but the times had changed, and the ratings were low. Unlike another Italian ladykiller of his generation, Marcello Mastroiannni, he had difficulty in adapting to life over 70. Serious nervous breakdowns kept him off the stage and screen for long periods, though he always bounced back with enthusiasm and an energy almost equal to that of his earlier years. In this, he was helped by his fourth wife, Diletta. Gassman is survived by two daughters from his first and second marriages, by Alessandro, a popular young movie star, from his marriage to Juliette Meyniel, and by a son from his fourth marriage. \u0095 Vittorio Gassman, actor, born September 1 1922; died June 29 2000",

      "bodyText": "The Best Man is a really horrible film, at once boorish and sentimental, and riddled with smug and repulsive misogyny - an attitude to women which switches between condescension and frank contempt. Like The Wood, actually a much sweeter and more good-natured film distributed here earlier this year, this is a comedy about a group of prosperous African-American professionals. They are college buddies, who are reunited when one of their group, Lance (Morris Chestnut) now a famous football player, is to be married. But there's trouble in store because Harper (Taye Diggs) is about to publish an autobiographical novel which reveals that he was once secretly involved with Lance's fianc\u00e9e Mia (Monica Calhoun). So he spends his time desperately trying to confiscate a preview copy knocking around. Harper apparently believes that once locked inside matrimony, Lance and Mia will somehow not be emotionally affected by the published novel - a plot glitch which points to a naive, fatuous assumption about the institution of marriage itself. The women are represented as simpering idiots without an intelligent word to say for themselves, whether they are homebodies like Mia or career women like Harper's old flame Jordan (Nia Long). Or else they are clinging bitches like Shelby (Melissa De Souza) who is hilariously humiliated and deserves it. Unfunny, unpleasant and boring.",

(When this film was premiered at last year's Edinburgh Festival, it was accompanied by a remarkable on-stage talk from Frank Mazzola and China Kong, who were able to show extracts from the butchered, and utterly different \"TV version\": furnishing us with an unmissable masterclass in the realities of film editing and a radical essay in the textual aspects of cinema. I hope that Mr Mazzola and Ms Kong can be persuaded to repeat this lecture all over the country.) </p> <p>The plot that Cammell assembles could hardly be more toweringly absurd. Anne Heche plays Alex, a beautiful young woman who works in a shady and disreputable investment bank. Threatened with the sack for refusing to put out for a mega-wealthy client, she needs new income to service the mortgage on her fabulous beachfront house - so she becomes a high-class call girl!</p> <p>But Cammell muffles the ironies and illogicalities of this by reshuffling the sequence of events: and we are plunged straight away into her encounter with a client: \u00fcber-criminal Christopher Walken, with his dyed black hair and lizardly features looking even more vampiric than he did in The Addiction. He is paying Heche a grand and a half to do weird stuff to him with sex toys in his hotel suite.</p> <p>His driver and bodyguard Tony (Steven Hauer) drives her back to her house afterwards, and in a stomach-turning scene rapes her - then sneeringly reveals that he is an undercover cop who has Walken under surveillance and blackmails Alex into helping him. It is a queasy sink of double-cross and betrayal which is worsened and yet redeemed when Heche finds herself falling into an intensely passionate affair with Walken's beautiful Chinese wife, Virginia (Joan Chen). </p> <p>So this is a mise-en-sc\u00e8ne of almost operatic complexity and stridency, and in the service of this, Cammell elicits the most outrageously camp performance from Walken as the villain.

And the resolution to this scene is exquisite in its chutzpah and farcical bad taste. Amidst this stylised grotesquerie, however, is a startlingly intense and believable love story between Virginia and Alex, humane and tender, which is ignited by a very erotic and convincing love scene. </p> <p>In its current form, Wild Side might simply still be too sprawling, too undisciplined and in parts too unfocused to gain a wide following.

Italy, not Holland, will meet France in the final of the 2000 European Championship on Sunday because at the most vital moments they kept their heads and when a scoreless, disappointing semi-final went to penalties they forgot the habits of a lifetime and won a shoot-out at the fifth time of asking. </p> <p>Francesco Toldo, the Italian goalkeeper, kept out kicks from Frank de Boer and Paul Bosvelt while in between Jaap Stam lent him a hand by shooting wildly over the bar. Italy's captain, Paolo Maldini, caused his countrymen a moment or two of angst by missing one but as it turned out the cheeky check and chip from Francesco Totti which sent Edwin van der Sar the wrong way proved sufficient to win the lottery 3-1. </p> <p>That Italy had managed to take the game to penalties was a heroes' tale in itself. Reduced to 10 men following the dismissal of Gianluca Zambrotta for a second bookable foul just past the half-hour they defended with all the discipline, organisation and composure which have for so long been the hallmarks of Italian football. </p> <p>Alessandro Nesta's role in tracking down Patrick Kluivert with the single-mindedness of a Mountie became one of the outstanding performances of Euro 2000, with Fabio Cannavaro not far behind him. The Dutch might pass the ball to perdition but seldom were they allowed to find the routes through the middle which against Yugoslavia in the quarter-finals might have been motorways but which yesterday became culs-de-sac. </p> <p>That Holland should miss three of their penalties at the end of the match was scarcely surprising since they had failed to score from two awarded them during it. First Frank de Boer saw one saved, then Kluivert hit a post, as Dennis Bergkamp had done from open play early in the match. </p> <p>Sensing there was no future in taking on Holland in an open game, Italy always in tended to defend in depth and look for opportunities to score on the break. The art of playing against Italian sides when they are in this kind of grudging mood is to strike before the concrete sets. Once Italy were reduced to 10 players extra-time and penalties became almost inevitable. </p> <p>The moment which might have given the Dutch a half-time lead followed one of the few occasions when Bergkamp, who after another fitful performance gave way to Clarence Seedorf for extra-time, decided to take on an Italian defender, in this case Mark Iuliano. A drop of the shoulder and Bergkamp was through, though, only to see his shot rebound from the far post after it had beaten Toldo. </p> <p>Yet exquisite though some of the touches from Kluivert and Bergkamp might be they had rarely produced a significant threat, and when Kluivert did flick the ball over Nesta's head at the end of the half to set himself up for a shot the result was weak and off target. </p> <p>In the first half Italy's most critical period followed Zambrotta's dismissal after 33 min utes. He had to go, no argument about that, for having been booked for fouling Boudewijn Zenden on the quarter-hour he now took the winger's legs away after being beaten on the turn. </p> <p>Four minutes later, as Kluivert met a centre from Marc Overmars and prepared to turn, he was hampered by a tug from Nesta and Italian protests at the penalty which followed were more routine than realistic. In any case De Boer's kick was struck at a saveable height and duly kept out by a diving Toldo. </p> <p>The loss of Zambrotta was never going to be much of an advantage for Holland since they now found themselves having to break down an eight-man defence once Italy had switched to 4-4-1, with Filippo Inzaghi left up front and Alessandro del Piero tucked into the vacancy on the right side of their midfield. The Dutch might attack in waves but, like the incoming tide, it was only every seventh roller that really threatened. </p> <p>The second Dutch penalty came two minutes past the hour after Edgar Davids, bursting on to a ball from Zenden, was brought down by Iuliano just inside the area. Kluivert's kick was perfect in every way except one: after sending Toldo the wrong way it rebounded from the foot of the left-hand post. </p> <p>Italy could hardly be blamed for believing that their fortunes had received a papal blessing. Everywhere that Kluivert went Nesta was sure to go. </p> <p>Yet twice Marco Delvecchio, who had replaced Inzaghi after 66 minutes, could have snatched a goal for Italy. In the 90th minute he shot wide and in the 100th, with the Dutch defence caught upfield, he failed to beat Van der Sar. </p> <p>That was the nearest either side came to a golden goal. For the Dutch the rest was leaden. Now Zinedine Zidane will attempt to succeed where Bergkamp failed. Much of Holland will be behind him.</p>",
