      "body": "<p>There has been talk among Middlesbrough fans for some time about the perceived inadequacies of Bryan Robson's coaching staff, particularly the former Old Trafford pairing of Gordon McQueen and Viv Anderson. </p> <p>Striding out of a pub in Middlesbrough half-an-hour before Saturday's match with Bradford came three of Teesside's finest - burly blokes who spoke in the loud, deep, rumbling tones of cement mixers. </p> <p>One expressed the desire for defeat followed by Robson's departure. \"You say that,\" his mate responded, \"but what if he goes and they put Anderson and McQueen in charge?\" </p> <p>\"I'll go up the Transporter Bridge and jump off,\" came the swift response. </p> <p>\"You'll have to join the queue,\" the third member of the trio said. </p> <p>\"Hey, I tell you what,\" the first man replied, brightening, \"McQueen and Anderson get the job, we'll bomb over to the Trannie, charge \u00a31 entrance and we'll have our season-ticket money back in five minutes.\" </p> <p>Unhappily for this triumvirate, their brilliant entrepreneurial scheme was scotched by a combination of a late Paul Ince equaliser and the rumours of the impending arrival of the coaching guru Terry Venables. </p> <p>Admittedly, on a rain-swept Cleveland Saturday that had passed from dawn to dusk without anything so pretentious as morning and afternoon in between, the prospect of the irredeemably West End Venables making the trek north seemed an unlikely one.

      "bodyText": "There has been talk among Middlesbrough fans for some time about the perceived inadequacies of Bryan Robson's coaching staff, particularly the former Old Trafford pairing of Gordon McQueen and Viv Anderson. Striding out of a pub in Middlesbrough half-an-hour before Saturday's match with Bradford came three of Teesside's finest - burly blokes who spoke in the loud, deep, rumbling tones of cement mixers. One expressed the desire for defeat followed by Robson's departure. \"You say that,\" his mate responded, \"but what if he goes and they put Anderson and McQueen in charge?\" \"I'll go up the Transporter Bridge and jump off,\" came the swift response. \"You'll have to join the queue,\" the third member of the trio said. \"Hey, I tell you what,\" the first man replied, brightening, \"McQueen and Anderson get the job, we'll bomb over to the Trannie, charge \u00a31 entrance and we'll have our season-ticket money back in five minutes.\" Unhappily for this triumvirate, their brilliant entrepreneurial scheme was scotched by a combination of a late Paul Ince equaliser and the rumours of the impending arrival of the coaching guru Terry Venables. Admittedly, on a rain-swept Cleveland Saturday that had passed from dawn to dusk without anything so pretentious as morning and afternoon in between, the prospect of the irredeemably West End Venables making the trek north seemed an unlikely one. There is a precedent, however - Malcom Allison. In October 1982 when the Dartford-born Allison took charge at Ayresome Park he was pretty much the apotheosis of cockney swank. Fedora hats, big cigars, champagne and snaps of him wallowing in the communal baths at Selhurst Park with the Crystal Palace team and soft-porn star Fiona Richmond had established Big Mal as an internationally renowned flash wideboy. El Tel, a Palace player at the time of the Richmond incident (he sensibly ducked out of that particular photo opportunity), looks thin and etiolated when set beside him. In an interview in the Middlesbrough Supporters South newsletter last year Allison revealed that it was he who suggested to Venables that he take on Bryan Robson as part of the England coaching staff, a piece of matchmaking that did much to fuel the weekend rumours. Eighteen years ago the arrival of Allison, who had recently won the Portuguese double with Sporting Lisbon, caused a greater stir in Middlesbrough than that of Venables would today. Back then the club was in even greater difficulties.

      "body": "<p>The government's new white paper on the countryside is full of good intentions about reinvigorating the rural economy. There will be measures to provide affordable housing, develop better public transport and encourage commercial development and diversification. That's all fine, but it is built on a flawed premise: that the needs of country folk are somehow different from those of townies. They aren't. </p> <p>Of course, there is a need for affordable housing: ask anyone in Middle Wallop, or in Bermondsey. Naturally, the countryside needs better public transport - so how was it this morning on the Tube? And it goes without saying that new jobs must be created: anyone in Sunderland or Paisley knows that. </p> <p>There is something essentially condescending about the government assumption that the rural lives are any different from urban ones. And even if they were, how could a set of new measures be applied evenly to the Lincolnshire Wolds, the Somerset Levels, the Romney Marshes, and the Cumbrian hills? When it comes to regional variations, one size most definitely does not fit all. </p> <p>The very concept of \"countryside\" is blurred by sentiment. We like to think that our landscapes are as old as time, and that human encroachment is at best a necessary evil. That's rubbish. Virtually every square inch of our island has been moulded and shaped by us. We made the fields, drained the meadows, sent our sheep to graze the hills, diverted the rivers and built the walls. The hedgerows being ripped out, to universal lamentation, mark the historically recent enclosure of old common lands - one of the most dramatic human assaults on the landscape. </p> <p>Of course, the countryside is changing fast. It always has. A century ago or more, Flora Thompson wrote about the fast-vanishing lifestyle of rural north Oxfordshire, in Lark Rise. Scarcely a generation later Laurie Lee wrote about about the same thing happening in Gloucestershire, in Cider With Rosie. Their worlds were utterly different from each other. Now, again, we have the sentimentalists droning on about the pace of change, and the irreversible damage being done to our green and pleasant heritage. </p> <p>The very people who are most garrulous about rural problems are those who contribute to them. They are the weekenders, the second home-owners, the four-wheel drivers and the \"green-welly\" class in general. And the answers they have come up with, exactly reflect their own interests.</p> <p>The white paper talks of relaxing the planning regime - already in tatters - to encourage the conversion of farm buildings, for example, into high-tech offices.

      "bodyText": "The government's new white paper on the countryside is full of good intentions about reinvigorating the rural economy. There will be measures to provide affordable housing, develop better public transport and encourage commercial development and diversification. That's all fine, but it is built on a flawed premise: that the needs of country folk are somehow different from those of townies. They aren't. Of course, there is a need for affordable housing: ask anyone in Middle Wallop, or in Bermondsey. Naturally, the countryside needs better public transport - so how was it this morning on the Tube? And it goes without saying that new jobs must be created: anyone in Sunderland or Paisley knows that. There is something essentially condescending about the government assumption that the rural lives are any different from urban ones. And even if they were, how could a set of new measures be applied evenly to the Lincolnshire Wolds, the Somerset Levels, the Romney Marshes, and the Cumbrian hills? When it comes to regional variations, one size most definitely does not fit all. The very concept of \"countryside\" is blurred by sentiment. We like to think that our landscapes are as old as time, and that human encroachment is at best a necessary evil. That's rubbish. Virtually every square inch of our island has been moulded and shaped by us. We made the fields, drained the meadows, sent our sheep to graze the hills, diverted the rivers and built the walls. The hedgerows being ripped out, to universal lamentation, mark the historically recent enclosure of old common lands - one of the most dramatic human assaults on the landscape. Of course, the countryside is changing fast. It always has. A century ago or more, Flora Thompson wrote about the fast-vanishing lifestyle of rural north Oxfordshire, in Lark Rise. Scarcely a generation later Laurie Lee wrote about about the same thing happening in Gloucestershire, in Cider With Rosie. Their worlds were utterly different from each other. Now, again, we have the sentimentalists droning on about the pace of change, and the irreversible damage being done to our green and pleasant heritage. The very people who are most garrulous about rural problems are those who contribute to them. They are the weekenders, the second home-owners, the four-wheel drivers and the \"green-welly\" class in general. And the answers they have come up with, exactly reflect their own interests. The white paper talks of relaxing the planning regime - already in tatters - to encourage the conversion of farm buildings, for example, into high-tech offices. What a boon that will be for the Jeremies and Fionas who want to move out of the city and work from home. There is also talk of reviving the fortunes of old market towns, many of which have been blighted by the closure of shops and pubs and other businesses. An excellent idea, but how exactly is it to be done? New rural bus services would be grand, but why exactly would people come into a market town, if there is no market? Nothing in the white paper addresses the fundamentals of rural decline, which are more or less exactly the same as those of urban decline: to take an obvious example, the remorseless grip of the giant supermarket companies on the consumer economy. They drive small traders out of business, force down farm prices, and clog the national road network with their juggernauts. A community bus service is unlikely to make much of a dent in their monopolistic ambition, except by delivering even more customers to the out-of-town Asdawaytescobury's.",

Schools believe there is no appeal against Ofsted judgments.But if Crown Woods wins, others could challenge the monopolists. </p> <p>A teacher wrote to me recently asking if I could explain her inspection feedback. Though fully bilingual in both English and Ofsted, I was baffled. One inspector described a lesson as being \"on the sound side of satisfactory\". Later in the week a different inspector summarised a session as \"on the satisfactory side of sound\". Another teacher, with 25 years' teaching experience, told me that her feedback stated, \"Your lessons are generally good and never less than sound\". A quarter of a century in a nutshell. </p> <p>What on earth do words such as \"sound\" and \"satisfactory\" do to improve someone's performance? As a researcher and teacher trainer, I watch dozens of lessons in primary and secondary schools. Ofsted-speak never features. Nor does it figure in any aspect of daily life: \"These frozen peas are generally sound\"; \"Beethoven's Fifth Symphony is well above the national average\"; \"This car needs to go into special measures\". I think not. </p> <p>Such episodes from Ofsted inspections explain exactly what is wrong with the empire over which Woodhead presided. Set up so it could be sustained by armies of private profit-making firms, it had to be formulaic. All of them would, in theory, apply the same dreary procedures. The many good inspectors have tried to humanise the process, often apologising in advance for turning into the speaking clock at the final debriefing. </p> <p>But why should they have to do this? Teaching is supposed to be a creative activity, carried out by professional people, not by robots. It is not surprising that they see such formulae, detached from intelligent dialogue and advice, as insensitive and professionally demeaning. </p> <p>The saddest feature about Ofsted during the last six years has been its low credibility. Few people working in education feel they can take its pronouncements seriously. Too many of them seemed to reflect Woodhead's own prejudices. What is often a mixed picture in research studies, like the efficacy of \"traditional\" teaching, was presented as much more certain in his pronouncements. The many drafts of the report on Birmingham local education authority showed inconsistencies. In one section it would say there were real improvements, not mere rhetoric, while in a later one it would attack rhetoric. </p> <p>There are exceptions. He drew attention to the lower achievement of boys before it became a fashionable topic. This is precisely what a chief inspector should do. He talked, quite rightly, about schools that were failing their pupils. This should certainly not be a taboo subject, but nor should it be used to flagellate the mass of teachers. </p> <p>Of course schools gain something from inspection. People who say they learned nothing at all are either arrogant or unwilling to listen. The question is: would head governors, given a choice, pay such a substantial sum of money for a limited product and a high degree of stress? </p> <p>Inspection is far too important to be done mechanically. Reform of Ofsted is long overdue. The departure of Woodhead, and other senior people close to retirement, offers an opportunity to fashion something that suits the needs of 21st-century schools better than the current 19th-century model of scourging. </p> <p>First, politicians must not panic and enmesh the next chief inspector in a strait-jacket of committees and ministerial approval. There were good reasons why, for most of two centuries, it was the monarch's inspectorate. We need an independentservice, where the chief inspector is free to praise and criticise, provided judgment is based on evidence. </p> <p>Second, there should be a combined local and national inspection service, bringing together the objectivity and overview of national inspectors with the local knowledge of those in the region. There could thus be proper follow-up of reports to make sure that action followed, rather than relief or inertia. </p> <p>Third, schools that are succeeding should be left in peace for longer, with interim mini-inspections to make sure all is well and the option to mount a full-scale inspection if there is just cause. </p> <p>Fourth, the dictionary of Ofstedspeak should be buried at the foot of a deep mine and left to rot, so that normal intelligent dialogue could take place when schools are inspected. </p> <p>When the retiring chief inspector enters the House of Lords, the myths will resurface. Apparently he drove up standards (inspected schools actually improved more slowly than non-inspected schools). He fought a lone battle (no one else in education wanted to improve things?). He managed a huge inspection programme (senior inspectors Mike Tomlinson, Anthea Millett and Jim Rose ran their socks off). The best thing about Woodhead's departure is that there is no \"ism\": \"Woodheadism\" simply does not exist. A new era can begin. </p> <p>I think Tomlinson will do a good job and restore credibility as chief inspector. His remark about not giving \"a monkey's toss about teachers\" was unfortunate, but in the same breath he said children should come first - not a bad sentiment.

An excellent idea, but how exactly is it to be done? New rural bus services would be grand, but why exactly would people come into a market town, if there is no market?</p> <p>Nothing in the white paper addresses the fundamentals of rural decline, which are more or less exactly the same as those of urban decline: to take an obvious example, the remorseless grip of the giant supermarket companies on the consumer economy. They drive small traders out of business, force down farm prices, and clog the national road network with their juggernauts. A community bus service is unlikely to make much of a dent in their monopolistic ambition, except by delivering even more customers to the out-of-town Asdawaytescobury's.</p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br><a <a href=\"  http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/country/article/0,2763,404113,00.html  \">Prescott unveils rural white paper</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/country/article/0,2763,404115,00.html\">Key points of the white paper</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/country/article/0,2763,404075,00.html\">Comment by Michael White</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/country\">Special report: countryside in crisis<br><br></a><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/story/0,3604,403906,00.html\">28 November: The Prescott empire</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4092333,00.html\">17 November: New powers to halt flight from the cities</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4090878,00.html\">15 November: All in the same boat</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.greenchannel.com/cpre\" target=\"_new\">Council for the Protection of Rural England</a><br><a href=\"http://www.acreciro.demon.co.uk\" target=\"_new\">Action with Communities in Rural England</a><br><a href=\"http://www.ruralnet.org.uk\" target=\"_new\">Rural Net</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.countryside-alliance.org/country/countryside.htm\" target=\"_new\">Countryside Alliance</a><br><a href=\"http://www.ivu.org/ape/talks/fairfax/fairfax.htm\" target=\"_new\">Countryside Protection Group</a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.countryside.gov.uk/\" target=\"_new\">The Countryside Agency</a><br><a href=\"http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/\" target=\"_new\">English Heritage</a><br><a href=\"http://www.english-nature.org.uk/\" target=\"_new\">English Nature</a><br><a href=\"http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/\" target=\"_new\">The environment agency</a><br><a href=\"http://www.cla.org.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Country Landowners' Association</a><br><a href=\"http://www.foe.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Friends of the Earth</a><br></p>",

There is also talk of reviving the fortunes of old market towns, many of which have been blighted by the closure of shops and pubs and other businesses. An excellent idea, but how exactly is it to be done? New rural bus services would be grand, but why exactly would people come into a market town, if there is no market? Nothing in the white paper addresses the fundamentals of rural decline, which are more or less exactly the same as those of urban decline: to take an obvious example, the remorseless grip of the giant supermarket companies on the consumer economy. They drive small traders out of business, force down farm prices, and clog the national road network with their juggernauts. A community bus service is unlikely to make much of a dent in their monopolistic ambition, except by delivering even more customers to the out-of-town Asdawaytescobury's.

      "bodyText": "George W Bush sought to tighten his grip on the presidency today by moving key operatives to Washington and seeking private financing for what he believes will be his transition to power. As the Democrats continued to make court challenges against the certification of Mr Bush as winner of Florida's contested presidential balloting, the Texas governor was pressing ahead with plans to form a new government. Meanwhile, the vice president, Al Gore, is contunuing his attempts to rally a sceptical public behind an unprecedented legal challenge to Mr Bush's pivotal victory in Florida, which was controversially declared on Sunday. Mr Gore claims ballots have not been fully counted and that \"ignoring votes means ignoring democracy itself.\" Today, the Democrat vice-presidential running mate, Joseph Lieberman, made the rounds on this morning's television programmes, fighting for the initiative in the PR battle following Mr Gore's televised address last night. But public opinion polls point to an uphill climb for the vice president. A CNN-USA Today-Gallup survey, released just before Mr Gore spoke, showed 56% of those polled believe the vice president should concede, and 38% believed he should not. Mr Bush's vice presidential running mate, Dick Cheney, who is overseeing transition planning, said: \"We can move fairly rapidly in a couple of areas, but he has to decide the timing.\" He added there was a \"good possibility\" that a Bush cabinet would include some Democrats, although overall the Republicans plan to take of the 3,000 top positions from them. Mr Cheney said: \"The governor has given me instructions to look in those areas \u0085 we clearly will.\" However, while Mr Bush wants the keys to the transition office, the general services administration in Washington is refusing to open it or release the allotted $5.3m for the next president-elect until the contest is unequivocally settled. Mr Cheney said: \"This is regrettable, because we believe the government has an obligation to honour the certified results of the election. Despite the decision, we feel it is our obligation to the American people to honour their votes by moving forward and assembling the administration that they've chosen in this election.\" Mr Cheney said Mr Bush was reaching out to people with experience, including some from his father's and Ronald Reagan's administrations, but he added: \"We're also going to want new talent. We're going to want to emphasise diversity. We're going to want a broad cabinet.\" There has been no letup in the legal skirmishing between the two sides. Mr Bush's legal team had written arguments to submit to the US supreme court in Washington in support of the governor's lawsuit challenging the validity of manual recounts conducted in Florida. At the same time, members of Mr Gore's legal team said they were hoping to provide Mr Bush's lawyers with their evidence and witness lists by tomorrow in their state court challenge to the Texas governor's 537-vote victory in Florida. Mr Gore's challenge to the results in Palm Beach, Nassau and Miami-Dade counties is before circuit judge N Sanders Sauls, a jurist known for swift action. The candidate who has the support of the state's electors before the December 12 deadline stands to become the 43rd president, since without Florida, neither can command a 270-vote electoral college majority.

      "bodyText": "A sharp increase in the number of Little Englanders who do not identify themselves as British and tend towards racist and xenophobic views is disclosed today by the National Centre for Social Research in its annual survey of social attitudes. As power devolved to Scotland and Wales over the first two years of Tony Blair's government, the proportion of English people saying they owed allegiance to England, not Britain, grew from 7% to 17%. The researchers discovered no evidence of resentment in England about power passing to the Scottish parliament and Welsh assembly, but the figures suggested that 6m adults in England no longer subscribed to a British national identity. More than a third of this group (37%) freely admitted to being racially prejudiced, compared with 17% of those who continued to assert their Britishness. They were also much more likely to think that immigrants take jobs away from people who were born in Britain (70%), that it was \"bad\" that people from ethnic minorities were getting ahead (26%), and that attempts to give equal opportunities to blacks and Asians in Britain had \"gone too far\" (46%). The Little Englanders were also more likely to say it mattered a great deal to being English that people were white and born in England, with English parents. Nearly threequarters (73%) wanted to keep the pound as Britain's only currency and 22% thought Britain should quit the EU altogether - a much more strongly Eurosceptic stance than among those acknowledging British nationhood. The survey by John Curtice, of Strathclyde University, and Anthony Heath, of Oxford University, concluded: \"We have found that those who feel English are indeed different from those who feel British, being consistently more inclined to want to shut out the outside world. Indeed 'Little Englanders' appear to be alive and well, if not yet very thick on the ground.\" By contrast 6% of those who described their ethnic origin as black and 7% of those who said they were Asian classified themselves as English, not British. More than a third said they were British, not English. The survey found a quarter of people living in England thought Scotland should become completely independent, but the most common response to Scotland's status was indifference. More than half would be \"neither pleased nor sorry\" if Scotland were to become completely independent. A fifth of English people wanted independence for Wales, either inside or outside the EU. And a majority (54%) thought Northern Ireland's long-term interests would be with the rest of Ireland rather than as part of Britain. But these reformist views did not lead to any great appetite for devolution within England, where 15% favoured regional assemblies and 18% wanted an English parliament. \"This is probably why the somewhat muted attempts by the Conservative party to identify itself as the party of English interests have met with an even more muted response,\" the study said. One reason why English nationalism might struggle to assert itself was a lack of potent symbols belonging to exclusively England after centuries of intertwined British culture. More than half thought fox hunting and Guy Fawkes night were English rather than British institutions. Paradoxically, a third thought the same about the Houses of Parliament, the centre of the British democratic state.

Well-wishers demonstrating outside the tribunal waved placards reading \"Ethnic cleansing at the Law Society\". Om Prakash Sharma, president of the National Council of Hindu Temples, said: \"The unjust, racist and sexist excesses of the Law Society need to be challenged\".</p> <p>The saga has proved highly expensive and embarrassing for the body which regulates and represents the 80,000 solicitors in England and Wales. \"I don't think there will be much change from \u00a32m by the time the tribunal finishes,\" said one member of the society's 75-strong council.</p> <p>Witnesses for the Law Society include two district judges. Ms Bahl, who is expected to give evidence today, was in line last summer to become the first Asian solicitor and first woman to head the 175-year-old organisation, but was forced to resign in March after findings that she had bullied and harassed five staff members.</p> <p>An inquiry headed by Lord Griffiths, a former law lord, found all the allegations could be proved. He said her behaviour had been \"at times demeaning and humiliating and at other times offensively ag gressive.\" One victim underwent counselling for stress.</p> <p>Ms Bahl, a former chairwoman of the Equal Opportunities Commission, is not challenging the Griffiths inquiry, although she does not accept its findings and denies that her behaviour amounted to bullying.</p> <p>Her claims centre on the way the society dealt with complaints against her and her exclusion so quickly in the inquiry's aftermath.</p> <p>She alleges that the way the society dealt with the bullying allegations was in breach of its own dignity at work policy. She claims the way the complaints were made public breached her right to privacy, and accuses the society of failing to give her a right of appeal against Lord Griffiths' findings. Not giving her sufficient time to answer the allegations breached natural justice and her right to a fair hearing, she argues.</p> <p>Robin Allen, Ms Bahl's QC, told the tribunal: \"The conclusion she bullied is something which she very much disagrees with. The applicant does not accept she was a bully, she doesn't accept the conclusions reached by Lord Griffiths.\"</p> <p>Ms Bahl alleges that after she announced she was launching a sex and race discrimination claim against the society, she was victimised and then treated in such a way that she was entitled to resign and claim compensation for unfair dismissal.</p> <p>A few days after the Griffiths report the council voted in her absence to suspend her. In preparation for a special general meeting of the whole profession to decide whether to expel her, copies of the Griffiths report were sent to all 80,000 solicitors. Before the meeting could be held, she resigned.</p> <p>The tribunal hearing, adjourned yesterday after legal argument, resumes today.</p>",

Her supporters, including the Society of Black Lawyers, claim the case exposes institutional discrimination in the legal profession. Well-wishers demonstrating outside the tribunal waved placards reading \"Ethnic cleansing at the Law Society\". Om Prakash Sharma, president of the National Council of Hindu Temples, said: \"The unjust, racist and sexist excesses of the Law Society need to be challenged\". The saga has proved highly expensive and embarrassing for the body which regulates and represents the 80,000 solicitors in England and Wales. \"I don't think there will be much change from \u00a32m by the time the tribunal finishes,\" said one member of the society's 75-strong council. Witnesses for the Law Society include two district judges. Ms Bahl, who is expected to give evidence today, was in line last summer to become the first Asian solicitor and first woman to head the 175-year-old organisation, but was forced to resign in March after findings that she had bullied and harassed five staff members. An inquiry headed by Lord Griffiths, a former law lord, found all the allegations could be proved. He said her behaviour had been \"at times demeaning and humiliating and at other times offensively ag gressive.\" One victim underwent counselling for stress. Ms Bahl, a former chairwoman of the Equal Opportunities Commission, is not challenging the Griffiths inquiry, although she does not accept its findings and denies that her behaviour amounted to bullying. Her claims centre on the way the society dealt with complaints against her and her exclusion so quickly in the inquiry's aftermath. She alleges that the way the society dealt with the bullying allegations was in breach of its own dignity at work policy. She claims the way the complaints were made public breached her right to privacy, and accuses the society of failing to give her a right of appeal against Lord Griffiths' findings. Not giving her sufficient time to answer the allegations breached natural justice and her right to a fair hearing, she argues. Robin Allen, Ms Bahl's QC, told the tribunal: \"The conclusion she bullied is something which she very much disagrees with. The applicant does not accept she was a bully, she doesn't accept the conclusions reached by Lord Griffiths.\" Ms Bahl alleges that after she announced she was launching a sex and race discrimination claim against the society, she was victimised and then treated in such a way that she was entitled to resign and claim compensation for unfair dismissal. A few days after the Griffiths report the council voted in her absence to suspend her. In preparation for a special general meeting of the whole profession to decide whether to expel her, copies of the Griffiths report were sent to all 80,000 solicitors. Before the meeting could be held, she resigned. The tribunal hearing, adjourned yesterday after legal argument, resumes today.",

The US Federal Trade Commission is threatening to scupper the deal over concerns that AOL would offer its internet service through Time Warner's cable network, locking out competitors. Regulators have prepared a court action to block the merger, but are waiting for further concessions from both parties. The FTC was due to make a ruling yesterday, but believes there is still time to save the deal. Time Warner went some way to dealing with regulatory concerns last week, when it allowed internet company EarthLink Network to use its cable lines. However, the FTC wants AOL and Time Warner to sign up two more firms if the merger is approved. If the FTC agrees to the deal, which was cleared by EU regulators last month, it must then be passed by the Federal Communications Commission. The merger has met with far greater opposition in the US owing to AOL's dominant position in the internet market and Time Warner's extensive cable network. The \u00a312bn joint venture between UK music group EMI and Time Warner subsidiary Warner Music broke down earlier this year because EU regulators feared AOL would use it to dominate the market for music downloads over the web. The prolonged wrangling over the world's largest media merger has damaged both parties' share prices and cut the value of the deal from \u00a3115bn to \u00a370bn since January.",

It's amazing what \u00a318m can do for a man's disposition, an infection Song appears to have caught too. \"I played four times for Liverpool this season, and I certainly don't think it didn't work out there\", he said. \"West Ham's squad is as good.

It's a growing audience, it's a great franchise and we are keen to consolidate and standardise our relationship.\" 5 Live's new three-year deal will see the station increase its coverage of live matches from 120 to 180 matches per season. The BBC station will continue to be the only national radio outlet for full live Premier League action. The new deal takes effect from August 2001.",

He said ministers would act to improve services; tackle poverty; help the rural economy; protect the countryside and wildlife and give more choice to local people. Mr Prescott told MPs in a Commons statement that the government would invest a further \u00a3192m over the next three years on rural transport on top of an existing investment of \u00a3170m. He said concern about speeding traffic would be met by allowing local communities to \"make villages and rural roads safer by reducing speed limits and investing more in traffic calming\". A further \u00a31bn over the next ten years would be spent on rural bypasses. Mr Prescott also announced a doubling of the existing Housing Corporation programme to see 3,000 \"affordable homes a year in small rural settlements and a total of 9,000 homes a year across all rural districts\". There would also be a new starter homes initiative to help key workers buy their homes in areas of high prices and high demand, said Mr Prescott. Councils in England would also be given the same discretion as those in Wales to end the 50% discount on council tax for second homes to allow the surplus to be spent on providing affordable homes for local people, Mr Prescott said.

      "body": "<p>Tuesday: Four days from now is my birthday, and although (apart from a middle ear infection, otitis media, in the right ear) my general health is no worse than usual, at this time of year it is a struggle to keep my thoughts off death and decay. </p> <p>Wednesday: On Saturday I reach 37, the official start of middle age, as I point out to my wife over what passes here for breakfast (three mouldy grapes and a glass of slightly rancid grapefruit juice: sometimes I wonder what Ivan Denisovitch found so bleak about his labour camp). \"Is that what you really think?\" asks Rebecca. \"Well it certainly was 10 seconds ago when I last spoke on the point. But perhaps I've changed my mind.\" A fermenting muscat splatters into my left ear, filling it with rancid juice, and I take this as a sign that the debate has reached a natural hiatus. </p> <p>Thursday: My mind is diverted when a friend calls for advice. For four years, he says, he has had stomach pain and heartburn recurring every few months, and he is in a state about an appointment in Harley Street later today. I explain that you can't have anything nasty in that region for long without suffering weight loss, rectal bleeding, altered blood and, after four years, rigor mortis and decomposition. My diagnosis is an ulcer or one of those hard-to-diagnose recurrent bacterial infections. He sounds relieved and grateful, although when I ask to see his medical notes the line goes dead. </p> <p>Friday: My friend calls to say that a latex-gloved examination and an ultrasound were clear, a blood test has been taken, and that the specialist suspects either a \"pseudo ulcer\" or one of those bacterial infections that are so tough to diagnose. \"What's a pseudo-ulcer?\" asks Rebecca when I boast about it. \"It's an ulcer that goes to modern art shows and whines about finding the artist's work 'a little jejune',\" I say. \"So you've no idea at all,\" says Rebecca. </p> <p>Saturday: In the Bayswater Turkish baths, where I spend my birthday morning, the spirits lift. I may be plump and balding, but I still have some hair and am not as grotesquely fat as I have been. In this heavy steam I could still pass for 35, I am reflecting, when a man with whom I often exchange grunted hellos asks how I am. </p> <p>\"Oh,\" I hear myself reply, \"mustn't grumble.\" He nods morosely. \"Yes,\" he says, \"at our age you can't expect perfect health, can you?\" Eventually, I recover the power of speech. \"If you don't mind my asking,\" I say, \"how old are you?\" \"I'm 74,\" he replies, sighing sadly. </p> <p>Sunday: I awake in the midst of what was an untroubled night, and am baffled when a run through the usual check-list for wakingness yields nothing. No nightmare and no drink-induced dehydration, while Rebecca has not yet confiscated my third of the duvet. And then it hits me. I have been awoken at 3.47 am by the need to void my bladder. My cousin, who is 40 next May, warned me of this. And now it's happened. At 37 and one day, I can no longer make it through the night. </p> <p>Monday: The urinary earthquake is followed by an ocular aftershock. Famously, shortsightedness can reverse itself in middle age, I remember, when in the sitting room I am struck by the clearest vision of the magnolia in the front garden ... a tree I haven't seen through this window for years. I am about to inform Rebecca of the miracle when a man enters the kitchen with a ladder and a sponge. </p> <p>\"This is Peter,\" she says, but very, very faintly. \"He's here to cream the widows.\" I ask her to explain (Rebecca isn't a widow yet; and if she was, she'd hardly have inherited anything from me worth creaming off), but I cannot make out a word of the reply. So this is the third leg of the inevitable three in which calamity presents itself: first the dodgy bladder, then the restored sight, now the deafness. </p> <p>How long now, I wonder before the short term memory goes and I start repeating myself? And how much longer before I can't remember as well as I used to, and start saying everything twice? Not long enough. Not nearly long enough.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Tuesday: Four days from now is my birthday, and although (apart from a middle ear infection, otitis media, in the right ear) my general health is no worse than usual, at this time of year it is a struggle to keep my thoughts off death and decay. Wednesday: On Saturday I reach 37, the official start of middle age, as I point out to my wife over what passes here for breakfast (three mouldy grapes and a glass of slightly rancid grapefruit juice: sometimes I wonder what Ivan Denisovitch found so bleak about his labour camp). \"Is that what you really think?\" asks Rebecca. \"Well it certainly was 10 seconds ago when I last spoke on the point. But perhaps I've changed my mind.\" A fermenting muscat splatters into my left ear, filling it with rancid juice, and I take this as a sign that the debate has reached a natural hiatus. Thursday: My mind is diverted when a friend calls for advice. For four years, he says, he has had stomach pain and heartburn recurring every few months, and he is in a state about an appointment in Harley Street later today. I explain that you can't have anything nasty in that region for long without suffering weight loss, rectal bleeding, altered blood and, after four years, rigor mortis and decomposition. My diagnosis is an ulcer or one of those hard-to-diagnose recurrent bacterial infections. He sounds relieved and grateful, although when I ask to see his medical notes the line goes dead. Friday: My friend calls to say that a latex-gloved examination and an ultrasound were clear, a blood test has been taken, and that the specialist suspects either a \"pseudo ulcer\" or one of those bacterial infections that are so tough to diagnose. \"What's a pseudo-ulcer?\" asks Rebecca when I boast about it. \"It's an ulcer that goes to modern art shows and whines about finding the artist's work 'a little jejune',\" I say. \"So you've no idea at all,\" says Rebecca. Saturday: In the Bayswater Turkish baths, where I spend my birthday morning, the spirits lift. I may be plump and balding, but I still have some hair and am not as grotesquely fat as I have been. In this heavy steam I could still pass for 35, I am reflecting, when a man with whom I often exchange grunted hellos asks how I am. \"Oh,\" I hear myself reply, \"mustn't grumble.\" He nods morosely. \"Yes,\" he says, \"at our age you can't expect perfect health, can you?\" Eventually, I recover the power of speech. \"If you don't mind my asking,\" I say, \"how old are you?\" \"I'm 74,\" he replies, sighing sadly. Sunday: I awake in the midst of what was an untroubled night, and am baffled when a run through the usual check-list for wakingness yields nothing. No nightmare and no drink-induced dehydration, while Rebecca has not yet confiscated my third of the duvet. And then it hits me. I have been awoken at 3.47 am by the need to void my bladder. My cousin, who is 40 next May, warned me of this. And now it's happened. At 37 and one day, I can no longer make it through the night. Monday: The urinary earthquake is followed by an ocular aftershock. Famously, shortsightedness can reverse itself in middle age, I remember, when in the sitting room I am struck by the clearest vision of the magnolia in the front garden ... a tree I haven't seen through this window for years. I am about to inform Rebecca of the miracle when a man enters the kitchen with a ladder and a sponge. \"This is Peter,\" she says, but very, very faintly. \"He's here to cream the widows.\" I ask her to explain (Rebecca isn't a widow yet; and if she was, she'd hardly have inherited anything from me worth creaming off), but I cannot make out a word of the reply. So this is the third leg of the inevitable three in which calamity presents itself: first the dodgy bladder, then the restored sight, now the deafness. How long now, I wonder before the short term memory goes and I start repeating myself? And how much longer before I can't remember as well as I used to, and start saying everything twice? Not long enough. Not nearly long enough.",

      "body": "<p>\"P'don? What did you say?\" was the soundtrack to my childhood, usually followed by a reponse of: \"Cloth-ears!\" From the age of two I was plagued with ear infections. Four, five, six times a year I'd complain of pain at school. After being sat down with my ear pressed against a warm radiator for the afternoon, I'd be marched to the doctor for yet another course of antibiotics. </p> <p>Continually diagnosed as having a \"weak ear\", I'd grown used to the pain and deafness, never questioning why I was continually affected. I remember, aged eight, returning from playing Oliver in the school play (not a dry eye in the house) and rapidly falling ill with yet another infection. Packed quickly off to bed, I woke the next morning with what can only be described as a three-inch, blood-and-wax worm attaching my ear to the pillow. More antiobiotics for Cloth-ears. These infections continued throughout my adolesence, and by my early 20s they had become more occasional but much more severe. </p> <p>One or two painful infections every two years became the norm, then, at 25, they stopped. An untroubled couple of years passed, until last April. Almost excited at the prospect of a week in bed, I went to my doctor for the quickest consultation I have ever had. I took the prescribed antibiotics but didn't get any better. </p> <p>This had never happened before, so I went to see another doctor to ask for a different antibiotic. After a little condescension he prescribed a new course. During this second week, I would wake every morning with dried pus and blood caked to the outside of my ear. </p> <p>Worried, and averse to shelling out for pills that did nothing, I returned to the original doctor. He took one look and referred me to the emergency ward of London's ear, nose and throat hospital. Several painful consultations later, where a microscopic vacuum cleaner was used to break off and suck out all the festering debris, I was diagnosed with cholosteotoma - apparently I'd had it for years. </p> <p>Cholosteotoma is a creeping, corroding disease which eats away the mastoid bone around the ear and anything else, including the three hearing bones, the ear-drum and, most dangerously, the lining of the brain, causing increased susceptibility to infections such as meningitis. </p> <p>The problem is that the disease can start in any part of the ear and thus cannot always be detected early on. It is only revealed once the debris is visible in the middle ear, which means its extent cannot be determined without an operation. You can only hope that visible debris is the start of the cholosteotoma and not its last push. </p> <p>The purpose of the operation is to cut away all infected areas, save the ear from further corrosion, and prevent the lining of the brain being exposed. It was this very op, according to new evidence released in last week's Lancet, which Oscar Wilde underwent, in a hotel bedroom in Paris, seven weeks before his death in November 1900. The surgery failed to save him, and may even have hastened his death. </p> <p>So I was given a date for early October - as chance would have it, almost exactly 100 years after Oscar's op. Now totally deaf in the affected ear, I went back to work. Optimistically, this meant that the debris in the middle ear was preventing sound getting in. Pessimistically, it meant that the hearing bones had already been consumed by the disease. </p> <p>Socialising became a bizarre experience - in pubs the background noise was deafening in the good ear, while conversation two feet away was inaudible. This feeling of having my head \"bubble-wrapped\" led me to assume that I was far more drunk than two pints could possibly make me. Also, not being able to catch what was being said prior to outbursts of laughter can lead to strange, paranoid assumptions if you're sick and tired of asking people to repeat themselves. </p> <p>As the operation date approached, those close to me became increasingly worried, while I adopted an attitude of, \"well, it needs to be done, it's usually not life-threatening, it's a routine procedure\". I went into hospital, becoming more and more nervous with each meal. </p> <p>I came round at 12pm the day after the procedure, with the left side of my face swollen and a tight ban dage wrapped around my head. Thick red blood was all over my pillow, and still leaking out of my ear sporadically. After a few hours of recovery, the surgeon visited with the post-match analysis. The operation had been a success, but the extent of the disease had been severe. </p> <p>First, two of the three hearing bones had been so corroded that their remains had been removed. Second, the lining of the brain was already exposed, necessitating a graft of healthy mastoid bone to plug the gap. Third, the operation, which normally takes one hour, had taken three and a half. The ear canal had been filled with surgical packing to aid healing from the inside out, and I'd only discover the extent of the deafness when it was removed three weeks later. </p> <p>During those anxious three weeks in bed, I encountered some strange side effects. I had been told that two important nerves run over or near the eardrum. Severing the first would cause one side of the face to droop permanently, which thankfully did not happen. </p> <p>However, the second had to be severed, which caused a loss of taste and feeling down one side of my tongue, meaning that chips, or anything else cooked in fat, actually felt like raw lard; a most unpleasant sensation. And I've lost half a stone. </p> <p>Chewing caused nasty headaches, but they diminished as the ear healed. The blood eventually stopped discharging and I began to sleep all through the night. Then, on Hallowe'en, I returned to hospital to have the packing removed. </p> <p>I had been warned to take my strongest painkiller beforehand, as it was going to be agony. I had feared this moment; excrutiating pain followed by possible deafness. As things turned out, the warm and sloppy removal of the packing was disturbingly pleasurable. </p> <p>Then I sat up, put my hand over my good ear, and realised the extent of my hearing loss. It felt like I had my hand over both ears: vague and muffled sounds trying to get in, but no hearing bones to help them onto the eardrum. </p> <p>A later operation to insert plastic hearing bones could help, but this promises no more than a 20% hearing increase. And all that pain and recovery to make the muffled sounds slightly less muffled does not appeal. </p> <p>Of course the operation was necessary, but the permanent loss of hearing will take some getting used to. After all the attention and worry, I feel a bit like a kid again. Or maybe that's because I'm back to saying, \"P'don? What did you say?\"</p>",

And what can you do to defend yourself from my poisonous mitts? </p> <p>Firstly, antibiotic resistant infections (the nasty ones I give you in hospital) are something we all share responsibility for. Every time you bully your GP into giving amoxycillin syrup to your children for their viral earache (or rather, every time the GP gives in just to get rid of you) you are contributing to the pool of resistant infections in the community. </p> <p>Every time you stop taking antibiotics before the course is finished, just because your symptoms have cleared up, you allow all the remaining bacteria in your body (the ones that were most resistant to the drug) to live on to fight another day, with someone else's immune system. </p> <p>Farmers, who, like doctors, alternate between saint and sinner in the popular press, routinely use animal feed containing low levels of antibiotics, because (and no one knows how) they increase the body mass of livestock by a lucrative 10%. In some parts of the world, farmers even use antibiotic spray to reduce the rate of bacterial infections on their crops. </p> <p>Bacteria are clever little things. Once one of them has evolved a trick to make it resistant to antibiotics, it tells all its friends, by sharing little blobs of DNA around so that the others can make copies and share in the secret. The more we use antibiotics, the more we send them into battle, the more chance bacteria have to see what we've got, and to develop new tricks for resistance. </p> <p>So now I've got that off my chest, how does it get me off the hook with not washing my hands in hospital? Of course it doesn't. But there are things that could be done to make things easier for doctors and nurses. </p> <p>Firstly, I don't see little pots of moisturising cream being handed out on morning ward rounds. There is a little patch of skin on my left hand which has been red, cracked and dry ever since I began working. There are (ahem) marginally more expensive brands of hospital handwashing product that come with moisturiser already in them. </p> <p>There are also (more expensive) alcohol-based handwashing solutions which take 10 seconds, rather than 90, to use. The infection control guidelines in my last hospital stated that these should be at the foot of the bed of every patient who was a high risk for infection: the ward managers, who run their own budgets like the ward was a franchise, have their own ideas. </p> <p>But smaller initiatives like these make much more of a difference to whether or not we give you nasty infections in hospital than punitive measures or nagging posters, because there are serious workforce implications to washing your hands. </p> <p>Studies have shown that if nurses on intensive care washed their hands every time it was appropriate, it would take up a fifth of their working day. I already work an unholy number of hours a week, much of it unpaid overtime, so do I add handwashing to my list of things worth ruining my social life for? </p> <p>Where is the initiative to increase staffing levels by 20% to fund our way out of this scourge of unwashed hands? Where is the evidence to demonstrate that the problem warrants that expenditure? Should I wash my hands after I shake a patient's hand? After I place a concerned hand on their relative's shoulder? </p> <p>And it's not just hands. There are numerous \"humourous\" articles in the Christmas editions of medical journals about the disgusting bacteria that reside on the white coat sleeves of junior doctors. My hospital laundry is only open four hours a day. And what about my stethoscope? </p> <p>So all of this fuss about handwashing guidelines and dirty hospitals (more cleaners, please) was a missed opportunity to promote real initiatives. Which is all very well, but you want to know how to stay alive once you find yourself trapped in my apparently filthy hospital. </p> <p>The first thing to remember is to get out as soon as you can. I fight a never-ending battle with certain social workers who give old people stuck in hospital a low priority for services in the community, because they labour under the mistaken impression that hospital is a safe place to be if you're medically stable. Of course it's not. </p> <p>Old people - or rather, people who are run down and weak - are vulnerable wherever they are. You won't catch me going down with one of those nasty infections I carry around under my fingernails: sometimes I don't even wash my hands before I go to the hospital sandwich bar. You could inject me with 10ml of pus from their festering bed-sores and I'd still be back for more. If you're in hospital and there is any chance you could get home, you should be campaigning tirelessly for your release. </p> <p>But what if you're stuck? The first thing to remember is that just because someone's in hospital, it doesn't mean that all responsibility for their existence is passed over to the state. If your elderly mother needs food to keep her strength up, then the best I can honestly suggest is that you bring her some, because all the jokes about hospital food are true (a prison meal is said to cost 50% more than a hospital one). </p> <p>If you think someone has been given a catheter for convenience's sake, ask the doctors about it. It's a route of entry for bacteria, and the same goes for cannulae, and both can sometimes get overlooked. </p> <p>And if you think that the state of hygiene of a patient or a part of the ward really is poor, then mention it to someone, tactfully, referring to specific events and choosing your target - a doctor, a friendly nurse - or even write to the infection control team.

So-called \"rural proofing\" measures expected in the rural white paper could mean new legislation being tested against a checklist of rural concerns before it hits the statute book. Ministers may have to ensure that changes in policy do not cut people living in sparsely populated areas off from essential services. They may also be forced to consider the effect that cutbacks would have on rural communities. The Local Government Association (LGA) has been pushing for such measures to be included in the paper, and policy officer Crispin Moore believes it has been successful. \"We are expecting to see some rural proofing measures,\" he says. The white paper is a high-profile attempt by Labour to counter claims from groups such as the Countryside Alliance that the government does not understand the problems faced by rural communities. It will introduce a focus on the social problems faced by rural communities, moving away from the traditional emphasis that rural policy has placed on agriculture. As part of this shift, ministers are expected to set out a range of proposals to strengthen the role of parish and town councils as the tier of government closest to rural people. Ministers are keen to lay to rest accusations by the media and the Conservative party that they want to abolish parishes and replace with them with area committees set up by councils. The government has always hotly denied the allegations. Sources familiar with negotiations over the white paper expect it to suggest extra funding for parishes as well as closer joint-working with district councils, including more devolution of district responsibilities to the parish level. Parishes may, however, have to prove that they are open, accountable and democratic before they can benefit from these proposals. John Findlay, chief executive of the parish lobbying group, the National Association of Local Councils, said: \"We welcome what the government is planning to do.

      "body": "<p>Scotland's parliament could decide to introduce free personal care for the elderly and chronically ill, following a unanimous committee recommendation today.</p> <p>The health and community care committee, which scrutinises the Scottish executive, today agreed that the recommendations of Sir Stewart Sutherland's royal commission on long-term care should be implemented, at an estimated extra cost of \u00a3110m.</p> <p>The decision will put extra pressure on first minister Henry McLeish and flies in the face of the message from Whitehall. The UK government has decided that personal care, in residential units or people's own homes in England, should be means-tested. Only nursing care will be free of charge. Ministers would be unhappy with free personal care in Scotland, which would lead in effect to a two-tier system in Britain.</p> <p>The committee's report calls for fairness and equality in service delivery, and an end to means-testing. Committee convenor Margaret Smith said: \"A civilised society is judged upon how well it looks after its most vulnerable citizens and it is clear that many of Scotland's most vulnerable people are not getting the support services they need or deserve.</p> <p>\"Throughout our 10-month inquiry, the overwhelming message we received from stakeholders in community care was that personal care services should be free at the point of use. While we recognise that such a commitment could have an effect on other aspects of community care spending, we received strong indications that this is an important issue of principle for the people of Scotland.\"</p> <p>The committee report said that community care for older people and those with learning disabilities or mental health problems needs to draw on evidence-based good practice. It also called for a commitment to raising NHS and local authority expenditure on community care services in real terms.</p> <p>The Scottish Executive welcomed the health and community care committee's report.

      "bodyText": "Scotland's parliament could decide to introduce free personal care for the elderly and chronically ill, following a unanimous committee recommendation today. The health and community care committee, which scrutinises the Scottish executive, today agreed that the recommendations of Sir Stewart Sutherland's royal commission on long-term care should be implemented, at an estimated extra cost of \u00a3110m. The decision will put extra pressure on first minister Henry McLeish and flies in the face of the message from Whitehall. The UK government has decided that personal care, in residential units or people's own homes in England, should be means-tested. Only nursing care will be free of charge. Ministers would be unhappy with free personal care in Scotland, which would lead in effect to a two-tier system in Britain. The committee's report calls for fairness and equality in service delivery, and an end to means-testing. Committee convenor Margaret Smith said: \"A civilised society is judged upon how well it looks after its most vulnerable citizens and it is clear that many of Scotland's most vulnerable people are not getting the support services they need or deserve. \"Throughout our 10-month inquiry, the overwhelming message we received from stakeholders in community care was that personal care services should be free at the point of use. While we recognise that such a commitment could have an effect on other aspects of community care spending, we received strong indications that this is an important issue of principle for the people of Scotland.\" The committee report said that community care for older people and those with learning disabilities or mental health problems needs to draw on evidence-based good practice. It also called for a commitment to raising NHS and local authority expenditure on community care services in real terms. The Scottish Executive welcomed the health and community care committee's report. A spokesperson said: \"We have made community care a priority in our policies and in our spending. We are now taking forward a range of measures which will benefit tens of thousands of old and vulnerable people. \"We are pleased that community care - an important and sometimes complex area of provision - is now high on the political agenda. We will examine the report in detail and respond fully in due course.\" The executive has eight weeks to respond to the committee's report.

      "body": "<p>Friday, December 1 is World Aids Day. In many countries people will be wearing red ribbons to show their support for those with the disease. As many as 34.4 million people on the planet are infected with HIV (human immunodeficiency virus). Twenty-four million of them live in Africa, where two million are dying from it every year. </p> <p> <strong> What is Aids?</strong> </p> <p> Aids, or Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome, is a devastating and incurable condition which is carried by HIV in body fluids such as blood, semen (a man's reproductive fluid) or mother's milk. It spreads mainly through people having sexual relations but women with HIV can give it to babies during pregnancy and birth and through breastfeeding them. </p> <p>The virus attacks the body's natural defences - the immune system. People can have HIV for several years without knowing it, but in many cases eventually their protection cells stop working and they develop other illnesses which are fatal. From the time someone is infected with HIV it is possible to pass it on to somebody else. One of the many reasons why Aids has hit developing countries so hard is because often they do not have the equipment or systems needed to test people for the disease. People remain unaware that they are infectious and so put others they have sex with at risk. </p> <p> <strong> How did it originate?</strong> </p> <p> No one knows. It is similar to viruses that affect monkeys and apes. One idea is that HIV first got into humans in Africa when someone killed an infected chimpanzee and its blood went into an open wound on the hunter's body. It has also been linked to a Polio vaccine that was developed using chimpanzees. </p> <p><strong> What makes it particularly bad in Africa?</strong><br> </p> <p> There are drugs that can delay HIV developing into Aids and there are others that can stop the virus passing from mothers to their children in breast milk. However, the companies in America and Europe that make these drugs charge a lot for them. Even when they reduce the price of their products they are still too costly for ordinary Africans. </p> <p>Education is essential. But safe-sex messages about using condoms have been slow to reach people in African countries, where some leaders have not done enough to fight ignorance and superstition about the disease. Traditional attitudes to sex do not help either - many men refuse to use condoms and African women often have little or no say in the matter. </p> <p>There have been many wars in Africa's recent history, and the armies fighting them may have spread Aids. The continent's poverty has also assisted the spread of Aids by forcing women into prostitution or weakening people through other illnesses and poor diet. </p> <p><strong> What impact is Aids having?</strong><br> </p> <p> Usually it is the young and the old who are at risk of disease, but Aids has been killing people in their 30s and 40s when they have families to support. There are over 13m Aids orphans in Africa. They are growing up neglected and uneducated. Many African countries are getting poorer as improvements in agriculture and industry made over the last 20 years are wiped out. One of Africa's greatest resources is its people and they are dying. A third of people in Botswana aged 15-49 are HIV positive. </p> <p> <strong> What should be done to help?</strong> </p> <p> Western countries are finally realising the threat that Aids represents to peace and stability in Africa. Their governments and charities are funding education and health work. African countries want to be given the right to make the HIV drugs for themselves at prices they can better afford, but the big drugs companies are unwilling to allow this. Campaigners also say it is a scandal that African countries are paying over $15bn a year to Western countries because of huge bank debts built up in the past. They think the richer nations can afford to cancel the $230bn they are owed. </p> <p> <strong> Is it all bad news?</strong> </p> <p> The red ribbon worn on World Aids Day is meant to be a sign of hope.

      "body": "<p>Today's British Social Attitudes (BSA) report complements yesterday's from the Fabian Society in what they say about our attitudes towards tax. Spending wins over tax cuts by a large margin among both Tory and Labour supporters. (The table on the right is based on an August ICM poll; people were asked about spending v tax cuts, given that over the next few years government is going to have enough money to do either.) There is also a body of opinion out there in favour of redistributing income to the poor, even at the expense of tax rises. </p> <p>Despite Thatcherism, it seems, social justice still conditions the response of a lot of people. According to the BSA, the middle class is pretty evenly split on the case for redistribution; the working class is two to one in favour. But progressives should not cheer too quickly. Fiscal ignorance abounds. People think the UK is more heavily taxed than other European countries - it is not. Some core attitudes are firmly regressive. Half the population, at least, opposes inheritance tax. A clear majority (58%) think income tax is \"too high\" and three-quarters say they are paying too much tax on petrol and in VAT. </p> <p>There is a problem with these findings. Each year the BSA throws up fascinating observations - men became less tolerant of extramarital sex in the 1990s while becoming markedly more liberal about gay sex. But what people tell pollsters has no straightforward relationship to the way they outwardly behave, for example when they come to vote or when they buy rightwing newspapers. </p> <p>The Fabians, admirably rationalist, think people would back more taxes at the ballot box if they were convinced the money went on good causes and was not \"wasted\". People are disconnected from government and think it unlikely extra tax would improve public services. The way forward, the Fabians say, is to make the whole business of levying tax and public spending much more transparent. A new independent watchdog should provide citizens with more information. </p> <p>Perhaps people would be happier if they could guarantee their tax went to those universal favourites health and education. According to the BSA study, admittedly based on last year's data, roads and transport are much less favoured. </p> <p>The other qualification to Fabian optimism is whether people trust government to do anything, especially spend well and wisely. Confidence in the state is diminishing here as in other western countries, which implies future support for higher taxes is going to be hard to muster. </p> <p>The public is picky about who it thinks deserves to benefit from tax-derived spending. Successive BSA reports, going back to the period of Thatcherite triumphalism, have found a majority of people do favour welfare state solutions to social problems, including extensive redistribution of income to the less well off. But they have distinct views about who they think worthy of any extra state assistance. Those who care for disabled relatives and people with disabilities themselves score highest, especially among women. The unemployed and single mothers are at the bottom of the list, even among women. Working-class people - those in households where a breadwinner does a manual job - favour redistribution of income in principle, but are not at all sympathetic to the claims of the very poor as beneficiaries. A transparent tax system that better reflected the public will could look a lot meaner than the social security system we have. </p> <p>Labour may take heart from the consistent finding that people are not against helping the unemployed with training and back-to-work schemes, such as the New Deal. Similarly Louise Casey, the homelessness tsar, is going with the grain of public opinion in her wish to help beggars with practical schemes for training and support rather than cash handouts. </p> <p>Geoff Evans, the Nuffield College, Oxford, sociologist who contributed a chapter to this year's BSA on differences in attitudes across the social classes, concludes that both Labour and the Tories have a problem with their \"heartlands\" (as for working-class supporters of the Liberal Democrats, they turn out to be neither liberal nor democratic). </p> <p>Labour's working-class base is to the left of official party policy on such issues as redistribution of income and progressive taxation. But the same supporters are noticeably to the right of Labour on crime and punishment and attitudes towards sexual and racial minorities. As for Europe, three-quarters of Labour's working- class support holds identifiably \"rightwing\" views. Labour has, of course, long been aware of the split. Since 1997 it has been Jack Straw's task to follow an illiberal line at the Home Office while (mildly) progressive policies have been followed by his colleagues in social security and the Treasury. The Tories are split, too. Their middle-class supporters are relatively benign on equal opportunities for blacks and Asians while their working-class support is vehemently opposed. </p> <p>A political party system that mirrored public opinion would look something like this. The \"left\" party would tax and spend more, be hostile to the euro, pro hanging, but relatively liberal on race. The right party would be even harsher than William Hague on crime and punishment but keen on higher public spending. For all the accusations of populism levelled at Mr Hague, he seems incapable of repositioning his party on the terrain of spending and redistribution despite - on this evidence - the votes to be won there. He has a problem with Europe, too, since lower-class Tories are significantly more Eurosceptic than middle-class adherents, who might be turned off by hard-line anti-Europe policies. </p> <p>If, meanwhile, there were a party based on the putative views of Guardian readers it would find itself pretty isolated from the mainstream of opinion, small in number but very progressive on tax and spend. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Today's British Social Attitudes (BSA) report complements yesterday's from the Fabian Society in what they say about our attitudes towards tax. Spending wins over tax cuts by a large margin among both Tory and Labour supporters. (The table on the right is based on an August ICM poll; people were asked about spending v tax cuts, given that over the next few years government is going to have enough money to do either.) There is also a body of opinion out there in favour of redistributing income to the poor, even at the expense of tax rises. Despite Thatcherism, it seems, social justice still conditions the response of a lot of people. According to the BSA, the middle class is pretty evenly split on the case for redistribution; the working class is two to one in favour. But progressives should not cheer too quickly. Fiscal ignorance abounds. People think the UK is more heavily taxed than other European countries - it is not. Some core attitudes are firmly regressive. Half the population, at least, opposes inheritance tax. A clear majority (58%) think income tax is \"too high\" and three-quarters say they are paying too much tax on petrol and in VAT. There is a problem with these findings. Each year the BSA throws up fascinating observations - men became less tolerant of extramarital sex in the 1990s while becoming markedly more liberal about gay sex. But what people tell pollsters has no straightforward relationship to the way they outwardly behave, for example when they come to vote or when they buy rightwing newspapers. The Fabians, admirably rationalist, think people would back more taxes at the ballot box if they were convinced the money went on good causes and was not \"wasted\". People are disconnected from government and think it unlikely extra tax would improve public services. The way forward, the Fabians say, is to make the whole business of levying tax and public spending much more transparent. A new independent watchdog should provide citizens with more information. Perhaps people would be happier if they could guarantee their tax went to those universal favourites health and education. According to the BSA study, admittedly based on last year's data, roads and transport are much less favoured. The other qualification to Fabian optimism is whether people trust government to do anything, especially spend well and wisely. Confidence in the state is diminishing here as in other western countries, which implies future support for higher taxes is going to be hard to muster. The public is picky about who it thinks deserves to benefit from tax-derived spending. Successive BSA reports, going back to the period of Thatcherite triumphalism, have found a majority of people do favour welfare state solutions to social problems, including extensive redistribution of income to the less well off. But they have distinct views about who they think worthy of any extra state assistance. Those who care for disabled relatives and people with disabilities themselves score highest, especially among women. The unemployed and single mothers are at the bottom of the list, even among women. Working-class people - those in households where a breadwinner does a manual job - favour redistribution of income in principle, but are not at all sympathetic to the claims of the very poor as beneficiaries. A transparent tax system that better reflected the public will could look a lot meaner than the social security system we have. Labour may take heart from the consistent finding that people are not against helping the unemployed with training and back-to-work schemes, such as the New Deal. Similarly Louise Casey, the homelessness tsar, is going with the grain of public opinion in her wish to help beggars with practical schemes for training and support rather than cash handouts. Geoff Evans, the Nuffield College, Oxford, sociologist who contributed a chapter to this year's BSA on differences in attitudes across the social classes, concludes that both Labour and the Tories have a problem with their \"heartlands\" (as for working-class supporters of the Liberal Democrats, they turn out to be neither liberal nor democratic). Labour's working-class base is to the left of official party policy on such issues as redistribution of income and progressive taxation. But the same supporters are noticeably to the right of Labour on crime and punishment and attitudes towards sexual and racial minorities. As for Europe, three-quarters of Labour's working- class support holds identifiably \"rightwing\" views. Labour has, of course, long been aware of the split. Since 1997 it has been Jack Straw's task to follow an illiberal line at the Home Office while (mildly) progressive policies have been followed by his colleagues in social security and the Treasury. The Tories are split, too. Their middle-class supporters are relatively benign on equal opportunities for blacks and Asians while their working-class support is vehemently opposed. A political party system that mirrored public opinion would look something like this. The \"left\" party would tax and spend more, be hostile to the euro, pro hanging, but relatively liberal on race. The right party would be even harsher than William Hague on crime and punishment but keen on higher public spending. For all the accusations of populism levelled at Mr Hague, he seems incapable of repositioning his party on the terrain of spending and redistribution despite - on this evidence - the votes to be won there. He has a problem with Europe, too, since lower-class Tories are significantly more Eurosceptic than middle-class adherents, who might be turned off by hard-line anti-Europe policies. If, meanwhile, there were a party based on the putative views of Guardian readers it would find itself pretty isolated from the mainstream of opinion, small in number but very progressive on tax and spend.",

Society Guardian's recent Power 90 poll ranked Ms Hancock as the 14th most influential person in the NHS.</p> <p>But trying to get anyone to admit they covet the post is tricky. Jane Salvage, director of nursing for publishing company Emap, and ex-nursing officer for the World Health Organization, is one of the few who will openly admit hankering after what she calls the top job in nursing.</p> <p>'It's a great job.

      "bodyText": "The most powerful position in nursing - and one of the most influential jobs in the NHS - will be advertised in the next few days as the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) seeks a replacement for its general secretary Christine Hancock. After almost 12 years at the helm of the RCN, the most famous nurse in the country - after Charlie and Duffy from Casualty - is leaving next June to take up a less demanding role as president of the International Council of Nurses. Her successor - who is expected to be unveiled in January next year - will inherit not only a \u00a390,000 plus salary but one of the most high profile trade union jobs around. Society Guardian's recent Power 90 poll ranked Ms Hancock as the 14th most influential person in the NHS. But trying to get anyone to admit they covet the post is tricky. Jane Salvage, director of nursing for publishing company Emap, and ex-nursing officer for the World Health Organization, is one of the few who will openly admit hankering after what she calls the top job in nursing. 'It's a great job. We're at a very interesting point in nursing's development and in the politics of the NHS and one of the reasons the job is so desirable and interesting is that in terms of the government's agenda you do have power to make sure that nursing makes its proper contribution.' But those who regard the RCN as an essentially conservative organisation wonder whether the independently minded Salvage - who last year tried and failed to get the job of chief nurse for England - would get past the initial weeding out process. Although she is well-known among nurses - she writes a regular column for Nursing Times - neither she, nor any candidate, can appeal to the membership because the general secretary's post is appointed by an RCN council committee rather than election. Ray Rowden, health policy analyst and a frequent thorn in the college's side, says he is not going for the job, despite recently standing unsuccessfully for the elected post of RCN president. He thinks the choice likely to be a current RCN official - such as Tom Bolger, the deputy general secretary, or Alison Kitson, director of the RCN institute (the college's educational and professional development arm). 'They're not going to go for anyone radical or exciting. I think it's going to be more of the same,' he says. Mr Bolger is strongly fancied for the top job because he has been Hancock's deputy for 10 years and knows the RCN and its workings inside out. His gender could be a drawback in a woman-dominated profession, however, even though Ms Hancock's predecessor was a man, Trevor Clay. Mr Bolger admits that he would consider the post - once he has seen the advertisement. The leather-trousered, spiky-haired Ms Kitson would certainly \"shock matron\" according to some commentators. Others question whether she has the \"common touch\" that would endear herself to members. Pippa Gough, head of the RCN's policy unit is seen as another possible candidate. But Gough, like Kitson, is regarded by many as more of a policy wonk than a dyed-in-the-wool trade unionist. Mike Hayward, an RCN steward in Portsmouth and frequent critic of the RCN hierarchy, believes that the post will go to Bolder, Gough or Kitson, even though none, in his opinion, fit the bill. 'What we need is a leader with a good trades union background because, after all, that's what people pay their pound, shilling and pence for.' A senior figure in the college says that so far just three people have informally indicated they will stand: Bolger, Kitson and Salvage. The past three general secretaries - Hancock, Clay, and Catherine Hall - were outsiders, which could be good news for Salvage.",

Several of the PML's senior leaders including Gen Zia's son, Ijaz ul-Haq, are infuriated by Mrs Sharif's sudden influence and the idea of an allegiance with Mrs Bhutto.

But it may be that Nawaz Sharif has gone too far in approving this alliance. \"It is an open question whether Nawaz voters and supporters will ditch him for this heretical conduct, but his political standing, and by that token the political rating of his faction, will suffer,\" said The News, a leading English language newspaper. 300 party dissidents, who opposed the alliance, stormed the party's Islamabad headquarters last week, tearing down and burning pictures of Nawaz Sharif. Mr Sharif's supporters noted that the police stood by and allowed the riot to continue, perhaps in the hope of derailing the cross-party alliance against the military. Last weekend another group of dissidents climbed on to the roof of the party office in Lahore and posed for cameras with their pistols, shotguns and Kalashnikov rifles, a blatant and unpunished defiance of the government's new curb on weapons.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>'This close up? Oh God... Really?\" With just the hint of a grimace, John Waters is having his photo taken. There's a whir as the lens zooms right into his face. He shuffles in his seat, makes sure that familiar half-smirk is in position, and stares obligingly at the camera, back straight, hands in lap. \"Oh God... I'm going to look like Lillian Gish on her deathbed.\" </p> <p>But he does as he's asked and he smirks while he's doing it. Because that's what John Waters would do. Naughty, kitschy, cuddly Uncle John, everyone's favourite dirty-minded, camply dapper film-maker and raconteur, turned out just-so with his dinky pencil moustache and neat little green suede sneakers. </p> <p>It's a willingness to accommodate somewhere between arch-professionalism and the plain good manners of an Eisenhower-era mother's boy. Uncle John, the 54-year-old clean-living, sleaze-fixated charmer who gladly transformed himself into a family-friendly cartoon character (literally so when he took a guest spot on The Simpsons). </p> <p>Except there's always been a side to Uncle John that wasn't quite so accessible. The side that collects the bad art of serial killer John Wayne Gacy; the side with an antique electric chair in his Baltimore living room; the side, in short, forever slightly at odds with the lovable schlock-hound of public image. </p> <p>And it's that side - furtive, gothic, more than faintly morbid - lurking in the background of his film industry romp Cecil B Demented, wherein a zealous young director and his band of deranged cinephiles embark on a kamikaze mission to kidnap an ageing, ill-tempered former starlet (played by Melanie Griffith) and destroy Hollywood. </p> <p>Sweet-natured though the results may be, there's still a fierce bristle to Cecil's Tinseltown-baiting polemics: the kind of trashy confrontationalism many assumed lost during Waters's lengthy transition from the squalor of 1972's Pink Flamingos to the polished feelgood of 1998's Pecker. </p> <p>Amid Cecil's retro air of Year Zero radicalism, there's a welcome reminder that, while its director may be one of the few film-makers who can talk with genuine ardour about ultrasuede, he's definitely the only one who would present his crew with Baader-Meinhof member Astrid Proll's photographic collection Pictures on the Run as a thank-you gift. </p> <p>\"Oh, they loved that,\" he beams. \"But the Weathermen were actually my favourite terrorists. I mean, I liked Baader-Meinhof, and the Red Brigades too. But the Weathermen were really the biggest influence on the film, because that's who I remember growing up.\" </p> <p>He leans in conspiratorially. \"Did you know Bernadine Dohrn [leading light of the Weathermen] runs a day-care centre? There's a great book called Sixties Radicals Then and Now, and it's so depressing, because they all run day-care centres. Can you imagine taking your kid there? 'OK children, remember - question authority!'\" </p> <p>Yet, even coming from as taboo-busting a figure as Waters, opening a movie with a glitzy premiere being assailed with AK-47s isn't likely to win many friends in Beverly Hills. After all, ever since Charles Manson's acolytes ran amok at Roman Polanski's LA home (their number including the director's now-reformed friend Tex Watson), violence against its own has remained strictly verboten for the US film business. </p> <p>Beneath the moustache, his top lip curls in amusement. \"Oh, but I hate real violence. I can't even watch... what's it called? When Animals Attack? Right. But fake violence I love. And the whole idea was that if cinema-going were ever political, and people killed for their movies, then this is how it would happen.\" </p> <p>There he goes again: the same old walking contradiction. Uncle John, who winces at cheesy TV shows, but gleefully mows down the (fictional) producers of (equally fictional) Forrest Gump sequel Gump Again. Mention their real-life counterparts and he barely stifles a sneer. \"They won an Oscar and made a billion dollars. What have they got to be mad about?\" </p> <p>Mention Melanie Griffith, however, and he's tact personified, batting your cynicism right back at you. John, you must know people will see something pointed in casting the famously erratic Griffith as a tantrum-throwing has-been? \"Well, we've all heard the stories. But I can tell you that if she was anything like that, she would never have got through a 31-day shoot in Baltimore.\" And, really, he sounds like he means it, the defence of his leading lady taking in flamboyant self-parody (\"I liked her immediately - we met at Pia Zadora's birthday party\"). </p> <p>He crosses his legs, uncrosses them, then crosses them again. \"The thing is, if you have any kind of image, you make fun of it. That's how you destroy it. That goes for Melanie, and for me too. Cecil B Demented is as much a joke at my expense, because it's about the fact that you can't shock people any more. Everyone's hip now. No one rises to the bait.\" He throws his hands up in despair. \"There's nothing left but snuff!\" </p> <p>He's got a point. When, as he says, \"everyone gets the joke\", and the likes of the Farrelly brothers have taken your hard-won niche and hawked it to the multiplex, what's a bad-taste veteran to do but reminisce? So, with Cecil, that's what Waters does. With its fond portrayal of the no-budget cause, that - minus the guns - is his own career up on screen. Nostalgia is everywhere. </p> <p>Even the film's battlegrounds - two exploitation cinemas, one catering for karate flicks, the other for porn - are anachronisms. \"Oh, those days are gone. Hollywood makes the action movies now, and porn cinemas are for people who like public sex, and since Aids you don't see many of them. No, it's gone. Over.\" </p> <p>But does he honestly miss it? \"Well, sometimes I miss that kind of insanity. I don't necessarily miss being poor. What I do think is sad is that everything is controversial now. I remember sitting through [1960s art movie] I Am Curious Blue, just because I thought maybe I could see full-frontal female nudity. Which, in itself, was the last thing I wanted to see. </p> <p>\"But everything's edgy now. I mean, that's the joke of this movie. Everyone wants\" - he's smirking like a trooper now - \"'edge credentials.' Now even the most outrageous movie is applauded. Back then, people hated them.\" </p> <p>Indeed, through Cecil's mad-eyed idealism, you sense Waters's own distaste for the whole slick machinery of modern film-making, the unholy tag-team of PR cheerleaders and entertainment media. In a script full of razor-sharp gags, one of the best comes on the set of Gump Again, as a heavily-armed Cecil turns to a cowering journalist and screams \"No more free food for you... hack!\" </p> <p>He leans in again. \"You know, someone actually ended a relationship with me on that basis.\" Really? \"Hm-hm. They said being with me was like always eating someone else's free food.\" I tell him that's one of the saddest things I've ever heard him say, and he can't stop laughing. \"Oh, but it's a great line, isn't it? What can you say to that? You're right, you know? Let's end it.\" </p> <p>And then he's off, away from real life, onto safer ground: which movie star will first have sex on camera (\"It's got to be Angelina Jolie\"), and the vagaries of amateur porn. \"You know those videos of people caught fucking on CCTV? They're incredibly popular. Bizarrely so. And I was talking to someone who produces them, and I said, 'Well, how come you don't get sued the entire time?' And he said, 'Oh, they're all very professional, they sign release forms.' So now, if you're a night watchman and you're found banging a cardboard box, you just sign your release form and take your money. Isn't that amazing?\" </p> <p>Waters waits dutifully for the flashbulb, then picks up where he left off. If there's one thing he loves, he says, it's flying business-class. \"I don't feel guilty about that. I didn't fly first-class till I was in my 40s. Although I do miss it. You know why?\" Another picture; another silence. \"Because the cute people are always in economy.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Cecil B Demented is released on December 8.</p>",

The 30 people set off from London's St Pancras station at 10pm last night on what should have been a simple journey of less than three hours. But a power failure on the line south of Bedford left them marooned on board the Midland Mainline operated train for four hours, before it finally moving as far as Kettering station. The bleary-eyed passengers were eventually taken by bus - which took another two hours - to Nottingham, where they arrived at 7am today, nine hours after setting off.

Midland Mainline spokesman Kevin Johnson said: \"Two trains travelling into London and the one heading to Nottingham were stuck when the power failure left signals out of order for hours. \"By the time the fault was fixed the line near Kettering had been closed for essential track replacement work so the quickest way to get them home was by bus. \"We are really sorry that anybody travelling with us is experiencing extended journey times, but clearly this is too much.\" All those on board will now be offered compensation for being delayed.

And yet many of us subject ourselves to it at regular intervals. So it's important to spare a thought for any younger members of the family, for whom this may be a wholly new (and equally traumatic) experience. Here are just a few of the many children's books which choose moving house as their theme, or simply their backdrop. </p> <p><strong> The Barn (Gary Crew, illustrated by Tom Jellett, Franklin Watts, \u00a33.99, 9-13 yrs)</strong> Carter Lawrance is not happy. His parents have bought a farm and the boy reluctantly leaves the cool city. Things get interesting when he finds a swamp with incredible insects. Close to the swamp there is a mysterious barn and Carter finds some prehistoric worms, but the most terrifying creatures are still to come! This short novel is part of the After Dark Series. It is craftily written, with suspense and a pinch of humour. Published in Australia in 1995, this is the first (1999) UK edition. </p> <p><strong> Mrs Bilberry's New House (Emma Chichester Clark, Mammoth, \u00a34.99, age 3-6 yrs)</strong> This tale holds a slightly different message. Mrs Bilberry is exceptionally happy, living in a little yellow house with all her pets, although she can't help being inquisitive about what it would be like to live on the other side of the mountain. So she sets off round the mountain - only to find a rather familiar little yellow house. </p> <p><strong> Foxdown Wood (Beth Webb, Lion Publishing, \u00a33.99, 9-13 yrs)</strong> A girl is deeply resentful of her mother for separating from her father and taking her to live in a run-down cottage. Then she becomes embroiled in a battle to save the local wood from property-developers in this time-travelling adventure story. </p> <p><strong> Don't Open Your Eyes (Ann Hallam, Dolphin, \u00a34.99, 12+ yrs)</strong> introduces Diesel and her parents, for whom 57, Linden Grove appears to be a dream house. Until, that is, the dream turns to a nightmare, as strange night-time noises from the neighbours draw Diesel into a dark mystery. </p> <p><strong> A New Home for Tiger (Joan Stimson, illus. Meg Rutherford, Scholastic, \u00a3 4.99, age 3-6 yrs)</strong> Tiger and his mother move house but Tiger is not sure he likes his unfamiliar new surroundings. He decides to head back to his old home, and in doing so recognises the true meaning of home. A colourful picture book. </p> <p><strong> Moving (by Michael Rosen, illustrated by Sophy Williams, Puffin, \u00a34.99, 6+ yrs)</strong> This is an unusual and striking book. The family is moving house and cat is moving with them. This is the story of the move from the cat's point of view. It conveys a sense of the secret life of cats and has exceptional illustrations. </p> <p><strong> Penny and Pup (Linda Jennings, Illustrated by Jane Chapman, Magi, \u00a34.99, 3-7 yrs)</strong> When Penny the dog moves house she feels lonely, so her family give her a toy pup to keep her company. Pup goes everywhere with Penny, so Penny doesn't feel the need to make any new friends. But one day Penny loses Pup. A touching story about friendship, with bold, vibrant illustrations. </p> <p>\u0095 For more independent advice books for all ages and on all themes, order Book Trust's 100 Best Books (\u00a33) by calling 020-8516 2993, or visit the Book Trust website at: <a href=\"http://www.booktrust.org.uk\">www.booktrust.org.uk</a> </p>",

      "bodyText": "Rigobert Song has insisted he does not want to be compared to Rio Ferdinand after completing his \u00a32.5m move from Liverpool to West Ham today. The Cameroon international is likely to fill Ferdinand's role in central defence, but insists he is a different type of player. \"You can't compare us,\" he claimed. \"I am different from Rio but I will offer the same hard work and desire to improve. I will be bringing my own experience and character to the club.\" Song, 24, also denied that his move to Upton Park was a backward step, claiming: \"The squad is as good. You could say West Ham are more ambitious because they want to improve. Liverpool are a big club - but so are West Ham.\" And Song, who signed for Liverpool two seasons ago from Italian club Salernitana, said he had no hard feelings at his lack of recent action at Anfield. \"You have to respect the wishes of the manager and his team selection,\" he said. \"He brought players in, but I still played four times for Liverpool this season, and I certainly don't think it didn't work out there.\"",

And they are actually green - unlike most grass elsewhere in Beijing where regular watering is discouraged because of a chronic shortage.</p> <p>Beijing's water crisis is going from bad to worse. Last year, the water table was lowered by more than two metres and the underwater reserve shrank by 1.5bn cubic metres. Rainfall in the first half of this year was 39% less than average.</p> <p>If Beijing needs any extra stimulus to take water seriously, it is the need to back up its bid to host the 2008 Olympics by looking green. Water conservation is an important part of the city's \"Green Olympics\" campaign, which also focuses on reducing atmospheric pollution, tackling factory waste and \"greenifying\" the environment.</p> <p>The irony is that planting more trees and restoring grass - much of it ripped out in the Maoist decades - means a higher demand for water. Most greenery is kept alive by flood irrigation, with water channelled into miniature moats and ditches. The city is now shifting more than a million square meters green space to less wasteful spray irrigation.</p> <p>No one hides the seriousness of the problem now. When Beijing was first built by the Ming emperors, says the latest edition of Beijing Review, it had enormous water resources, with lakes and springs which made it a city of gardens. Today, it has become \"one of the driest cities in northern China due to drought\".</p> <p>The Miyun reservoir, built in the late 1950s with Chairman Mao himself wielding a symbolic spade, may dry up within two or three years if last year's drought reoccurs. Another important reservoir, the Guangting, can no longer supply the city because of heavy pollution in its upper reaches.</p> <p>The immediate causes of the crisis are familiar ones. Beijing's population officially stands at 12m, but is swollen by at least 2m migrant workers. Improved living standards for the majority have increased the number of washing machines, flush toilets and other water-greedy appliances. There is massive wastage from poorly maintained mains while few people have enough social consciousness to turn off dripping taps in homes and on street standpipes. Water is virtually free: car washers and public baths have no incentive to limit their use.</p> <p>Beijing's city government has started a water-saving campaign, backed by new restrictions. It is phasing in a \"quota system\" - a euphemism for scheduled cuts - which the privileged capital dwellers have largely avoided so far. Prices for tap water supply and sewage disposal have already risen though so far only marginally: the government is only too aware that a rapid price hike could provoke unrest. New reservoirs and more effective sewage plants are now being planned.</p> <p>The water crisis is even worse outside Beijing. The state planning development commission has called for price reform throughout China where more than 400 out of 668 cities suffer chronic shortages. Peasant communities in some areas have waged war on their neighbours in disputes over water sharing.</p> <p>The underlying causes are agricultural overuse, deforestation, and excessive reclamation of flood plains. This results in the paradoxical combination of worse floods and worse droughts as the land's water retention capacity diminishes. China's deserts are growing by 2,460sq km annually.</p> <p>A plan to alleviate northern China's water poverty by diverting water from the Yangtze northwards - by one or more of three proposed routes - is likely to receive final approval soon. But this is no longer regarded as a save-all solution. \"In the end,\" said the China Daily last week, \"it is a redistribution of the same amount of water. The north will get more, but the south less.\"</p> <p>A new survey published in Outlook, a magazine close to the administration of premier Zhu Rongji, warns that shortages of water, petroleum and grain are the biggest bottlenecks to future economic development. China is one of the world's 13 poorest nations in per capita water reserves.</p> <p>Yet it is good news for hundreds of millions of Chinese accustomed to water rationing - in some cases only a few hours every other day - that the crisis has hit the capital so severely. China's leaders are becoming aware that the most serious threat to their rule may not be a desire for working democracy but a growing thirst for drinkable water.</p> <p><b>Email</b><br> <a href=\"mailto:john.gittings@theguardian.com\">john.gittings@theguardian.com</a></p> <p><b>Related special reports</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Tiananmen/0,2759,193066,00.html\">Tiananmen: 10 years on</a></p> <p><b>Other articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.searchunlimited.co.uk/search97cgi/s97networkr_cgi?QueryText=%28john+gittings%29AND+%28VdkPublicationDate+%3E%3D+01%2DSep%2D1998%29&amp;ResultColSize=2000&amp;ResultTemplate=ArchiveFull%2Ehts&amp;Collection=archive&amp;SortSpec=score+Desc&amp;Query=john+gittings&amp;ResultStart=1&amp;ResultCount=10&amp;ResultMaxDocs=1000&amp;Dtv=\">More articles by John Gittings</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.chinadevelopmentbrief.com/\" target=\"_new\">China Briefing</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.china.org.cn/\" target=\"_new\">Chinese government</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.peopledaily.com.cn/english/\" target=\"_new\">People's Daily</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.sinopolis.com/\" target=\"_new\">Sinopolis.com</a><br> <a href=\"http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/cntoc.html\" target=\"_new\">US library of Congress country study: China</a><br> <a href=\"http://202.84.17.11/english/index.htm\" target=\"_new\">Xinhua news agency</a><br><a href=\"http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/\" target=\"new\">China Daily</a></p>",

This results in the paradoxical combination of worse floods and worse droughts as the land's water retention capacity diminishes. China's deserts are growing by 2,460sq km annually. A plan to alleviate northern China's water poverty by diverting water from the Yangtze northwards - by one or more of three proposed routes - is likely to receive final approval soon. But this is no longer regarded as a save-all solution. \"In the end,\" said the China Daily last week, \"it is a redistribution of the same amount of water. The north will get more, but the south less.\" A new survey published in Outlook, a magazine close to the administration of premier Zhu Rongji, warns that shortages of water, petroleum and grain are the biggest bottlenecks to future economic development. China is one of the world's 13 poorest nations in per capita water reserves. Yet it is good news for hundreds of millions of Chinese accustomed to water rationing - in some cases only a few hours every other day - that the crisis has hit the capital so severely. China's leaders are becoming aware that the most serious threat to their rule may not be a desire for working democracy but a growing thirst for drinkable water.

ReplayTV chief executive Kim LeMasters, former president of CBS, was among the casualties of the company's change of direction.

      "trailText": "<p>Terry Venables was always going to be linked with Middlesbrough, but when reality bites, Venables' love of business looks likely to win over his love of coaching.</p>",
      "byline": "Martin Thorpe",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It used to be Tommy Docherty. Later it was Ron Atkinson. These were always the first names in the frame whenever a major managerial vacancy arose, put there with a knee-jerk scribble of the bookies' pen and little thought for the reality. </p> <p> Now it is Terry Venables. Whenever a recent shortlist has been drawn up, from Blackburn Rovers to Fulham to Chelsea to England, El Tel's has been the first name on the bookmakers' team-sheet, and also on those compiled by his media allies. Now Venables is in the frame again, hardly a gilt-edged one but enticing enough, and more than a figment of the bookmakers' imagination. </p> <p> This is a real offer, a big job and one that Venables could do. And the problem is that he is thinking of turning it down. If he does, it is hard to see him ever again returning to club management. At 57 time is running out - and, it seems, enthusiasm. </p> <p> Middlesbrough's offer to Venables is basically to take charge of the first team and steer them away from relegation while taking the current manager Bryan Robson under his wing in the hope that he can teach young \"Pop\" a few tricks of the trade - managerial tricks, of course, not business tricks. </p> <p> Having worked together during England's relatively suc cessful Euro 96 campaign, the idea seems sound. If Venables cannot see fit to take this on, he should surely be eliminated from all further inquiries. The time has come to put up or shut up. </p> <p> Despite the saying that you should always stick to what you do best, Venables has always fancied himself as much as a businessman as a coach, whether it be marketing women's wigs, writing novels, inventing television de tectives, owning night-clubs or football clubs. </p> <p> And, despite a well-publicised brush with the Department of Trade and Industry in 1998, when he was banned from being a company director for seven years, that fascination for non-coaching activities remains as strong as ever and looks likely to thwart Middlesbrough's plan to bring this Messiah into the life of Bryan. </p> <p> Venables is spending much time and money in Spain trying to set up a hotel complex for use by teams needing warm-weather training, along the lines of the La Manga sports complex. He also hopes to set up an academy in Spain where promising young players from around the world would come to develop their skills. </p> <p> Although attracted to the idea of becoming Robson's guardian angel, Venables feels he cannot give a full-time commitment to a club over 200 miles away from his London stomping ground, while also getting the Spanish project off the ground. </p> <p> He has other commitments: football schools in England which he is also trying to establish in the United States; a column in the News of the World, a Saturday lunch-time spot on Virgin Radio and a contract as regular expert on ITV's Champions League coverage. </p> <p> It is the itinerary of someone who looks to have long ago given up on ever getting the right call from the right club. After none too impressive stints at Portsmouth and Crystal Palace his reputation was no doubt higher in the minds of the bookies and his media allies than it was in the minds of the men who count: club directors.

      "bodyText": "It used to be Tommy Docherty. Later it was Ron Atkinson. These were always the first names in the frame whenever a major managerial vacancy arose, put there with a knee-jerk scribble of the bookies' pen and little thought for the reality. Now it is Terry Venables. Whenever a recent shortlist has been drawn up, from Blackburn Rovers to Fulham to Chelsea to England, El Tel's has been the first name on the bookmakers' team-sheet, and also on those compiled by his media allies. Now Venables is in the frame again, hardly a gilt-edged one but enticing enough, and more than a figment of the bookmakers' imagination. This is a real offer, a big job and one that Venables could do. And the problem is that he is thinking of turning it down. If he does, it is hard to see him ever again returning to club management. At 57 time is running out - and, it seems, enthusiasm. Middlesbrough's offer to Venables is basically to take charge of the first team and steer them away from relegation while taking the current manager Bryan Robson under his wing in the hope that he can teach young \"Pop\" a few tricks of the trade - managerial tricks, of course, not business tricks. Having worked together during England's relatively suc cessful Euro 96 campaign, the idea seems sound. If Venables cannot see fit to take this on, he should surely be eliminated from all further inquiries. The time has come to put up or shut up. Despite the saying that you should always stick to what you do best, Venables has always fancied himself as much as a businessman as a coach, whether it be marketing women's wigs, writing novels, inventing television de tectives, owning night-clubs or football clubs. And, despite a well-publicised brush with the Department of Trade and Industry in 1998, when he was banned from being a company director for seven years, that fascination for non-coaching activities remains as strong as ever and looks likely to thwart Middlesbrough's plan to bring this Messiah into the life of Bryan. Venables is spending much time and money in Spain trying to set up a hotel complex for use by teams needing warm-weather training, along the lines of the La Manga sports complex. He also hopes to set up an academy in Spain where promising young players from around the world would come to develop their skills. Although attracted to the idea of becoming Robson's guardian angel, Venables feels he cannot give a full-time commitment to a club over 200 miles away from his London stomping ground, while also getting the Spanish project off the ground. He has other commitments: football schools in England which he is also trying to establish in the United States; a column in the News of the World, a Saturday lunch-time spot on Virgin Radio and a contract as regular expert on ITV's Champions League coverage. It is the itinerary of someone who looks to have long ago given up on ever getting the right call from the right club. After none too impressive stints at Portsmouth and Crystal Palace his reputation was no doubt higher in the minds of the bookies and his media allies than it was in the minds of the men who count: club directors. He fancied the England job again but there he was thwarted by his past. And it is the possible resurrecting of that past that could also prove a viable reason to stay out of the limelight by turning down Middlesbrough's offer. Eddie Ashby is Venables's former financial adviser and personal assistant who worked for several of his companies even though, as an undischarged bankrupt, he should not have held managerial positions. In 1997 Ashby was jailed for violating bankruptcy laws and, angered by the way he felt Venables subsequently treated him, he has not spoken to his former partner since. On his release from jail Ashby began talks to publish his side of the story in which he looks set to reveal more about Venables's activities while in charge at Tottenham, England and Portsmouth. The book is due out soon. But, whatever the reason, Venables's love of business looks finally to have grown deeper than his affection for football management. El Tel appears happy with that.

Meanwhile, children upset by their classmates' intimidating behaviour were leaving. </p> <p>Now, the school has been transformed. \"It is a place where the pupils respect property, their teachers, and each other,\" says deputy head Kathryn Palmer. </p> <p>What makes this improvement particularly remarkable is that the main responsibility for it lies with the children. Highfield Junior offers a vision of how far a commitment to student-centred discipline can carry a school. Under the headship of Lorna Farrington - now a leading educational consultant - Highfield trail-blazed many of the peer-support systems that are now catching on widely across the UK. </p> <p>\"The school was not a safe place,\" says Farrington. \"Despite working flat out we were making little headway. Our thinking was wrong. We spent our time forever intervening and telling children what they should be doing. We were ignoring that they were the greatest asset we had in trying to improve things.\" </p> <p>The central mechanism for change at Highfield became class circle time, familiar enough as a structure for general discussion or topic work in primary schools, but now made into a forum where children could bring up the problems they were having with one another and work to find solutions. \"The secret was to concentrate on the behaviour and not the person,\" explained Farrington. \"We explicitly educated the children to become responsible and gentle in their dealings with one another.\" </p> <p>This meant that when, for example, a child's aggressive behaviour was raised, the circle would discuss, in general, ways of asking to join in with others' play that didn't involve thumping people. If a problem persisted, then the child in question could nominate up to three \"guardian angels\" - fellow pupils whose help could be sought if difficulties arose. </p> <p>Another innovation was the creation of \"playground peacemakers\". Children became trained mediators, offering support to those involved in break-time bust-ups. \"They were taught the value of giving those in conflict the chance to think up ways for themselves of solving their arguments,\" said Farrington. </p> <p>Meanwhile circle time continued to evolve. One successful development saw the children interviewing prospective teachers - including the new head needed when Lorna Farrington left to promote the Highfield model nationally. \"With everyone's agreement we filmed these sessions,\" said Palmer. \"They were very revealing - some talked to the children as though they were aliens. One head decided he couldn't do it.\" </p> <p>Farrington. says: \"It is about giving children choices in their dealings with one another. We love instructing children to go off and make friends without thinking of the hundreds of skills that that entails. There is no such thing as a bully or bullying. They are meaningless words and do nothing to tackle the problems children face managing their relationships. That is where the effort needs to be concentrated.\" </p> <p>\"We do not claim to have all the answers,\" says Palmer. \"But the benefits to the school have been enormous, with much of the petty conflict that used to clog up the day being resolved without teachers having to intervene. </p> <p>But schools attempting to solve disruptive and antisocial behaviour by establishing peer-support schemes must often overcome opposition from both teachers and students before the full benefits can be felt. Writing in a forthcoming edition of The New Therapist magazine, Professor Helen Cowie of the School of Psychology and Medicine at the University of Surrey, Roehampton, identifies a variety of constraints. </p> <p>\"Teachers are sometimes hostile about handing over responsibility for aspects of discipline,\" explains Cowie. \"Then some schemes must cope with pupils sabotaging them by inventing problems and making hoax demands. Also, those participating can encounter a range of negative responses.\" Cowie identifies how macho attitudes can act as a barrier to boys getting involved. </p> <p>\"Without everyone's backing such schemes cannot succeed,\" says Sally-Anne Wilsher, the head of sixth form at Wanstead High - one of five London secondary schools funded by The Mental Health Foundation to set up peer-support mechanisms. \"What's needed is a culture of care in which they can grow,\" she adds. This is a view shared by Cowie who recognises that \"some school environments can be so aggressive that the work of peer supporters is ineffective.\" </p> <p>Getting parents on-side is particularly important: \"Some are understandably intolerant of such things as bullying - they want six dead bodies hanging from the yard-arm,\" says Steve Baker, head of Lipson Community College in Plymouth. \"But once they see how effective good peer support can be, such hot-blooded attitudes do cool.\" </p> <p>Children leaving Highfield are lucky having Lipson to go to, as it is a secondary environment in which the same student involvement ethos applies. A common misgiving of primary teachers committed to peer support is the possibility their pupils will be disillusioned when they move on. </p> <p>At Lipson, circle time continues in every year group and older pupils offer the younger ones a wide range of peer mentoring and befriending. \"It is the little 'uns coming from a whole variety of primary schools that are the biggest problem,\" says sixth-former Adam Hodges. \"They often arrive with no idea of conflict resolution.\" </p> <p>The other great benefit of peer support at Highfield has been the boost it gives children's confidence and communication skills. Ten-year-old Helen Naylor is a veteran of the system: \"Before, I didn't want to go to school - if you had problems you had to be violent or keep them to yourself. Now it's different - things get sorted out.\" Her proudest moment was successfully resolving an argument between two girls. \"They were being horrible. I asked if they wanted me to do mediation. They did and afterwards became best friends.

      "bodyText": "\u00c0 quelques pas du mus\u00e9e du Louvre \u00e0 Paris, une cr\u00e9ation artistique qui ne passe pas inaper\u00e7ue a \u00e9t\u00e9 inaugur\u00e9e le 30 octobre. Sur la place Colette, dans un cadre architectural autrement tr\u00e8s classique, l'entr\u00e9e du m\u00e9tro Palais-Royal a \u00e9t\u00e9 re-look\u00e9e par l'artiste Jean-Michel Othoniel. Son Kiosque des Noctambules est fait de m\u00e9tal et de grosses perles de verre color\u00e9 : sur six poteaux, deux coupoles, l'une couleur de soleil et l'autre de lune. Prendre le m\u00e9tro ici n'est plus la m\u00eame exp\u00e9rience. Une nouveaut\u00e9, certes, mais qu'en pensent les Parisiens ? J'ai demand\u00e9 l'avis de quatre \u00e9tudiants en histoire de l'art que j'ai rencontr\u00e9s devant la bouche de m\u00e9tro. Qu'en penses-tu ? C\u00e9line: Je trouve \u00e7a original. Finalement, c'est dans la continuit\u00e9 de ce qu'a fait Guimard mais un si\u00e8cle apr\u00e8s. C'est plut\u00f4t marrant. Christophe: C'est de l'art d\u00e9g\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9, une nullit\u00e9 absolue. C'est plut\u00f4t insultant, une insulte \u00e0 l'architecture classique. J'esp\u00e8re qu'il y aura bient\u00f4t beaucoup de tags et que les chiens pisseront dessus. St\u00e9phanie: D\u00e9j\u00e0, je pense que c'est bien, un renouvellement de l'art dans la ville. Le verre est tr\u00e8s beau. Je ne sais pas ce que \u00e7a donne dans la nuit mais illumin\u00e9, \u00e7a doit tre tr\u00e8s impressionnant. Je trouve que \u00e7a va tr\u00e8s bien dans ce quartier mais je ne l'imaginerais pas \u00e0 Barb\u00e8s, par exemple. Ruth: C'est tr\u00e8s beau, toute cette couleur. J'aime bien, mais comme j'\u00e9tudie l'histoire de l'art, j'ai l'habitude de voir des choses comme \u00e7a tout le temps. \u00c7a ne me choque pas. Imposer l'art aux gens et \u00e0 la ville, est-ce une bonne chose? C\u00e9line: Oui. Mais je ne sais pas si c'est vraiment imposer, c'est plut\u00f4t proposer. Christophe: C'est pas de l'art, c'est une d\u00e9coration. Il n'y a rien de nouveau. C'est un choix politique nul, de l'art officiel. C'est le minist\u00e8re qui a impos\u00e9 \u00e7a, c'est de l'art technocratique. \u00c7a n'a aucun int\u00e9r\u00eat. Paris, c'est d\u00e9j\u00e0 de l'art en soi. St\u00e9phanie: La ville doit encourager l'art contemporain et pas seulement pr\u00e9server l'art du pass\u00e9, l'art nouveau, les bouches de m\u00e9tro anciennes. L'art est partout, m me si c'est pas toujours construit ni adapt\u00e9, ni catalogu\u00e9 comme de l'art. On peut trouver de l'art dans les \u00e9gouts, dans les catacombes, au Louvre. Ruth: Je suis belge et j'\u00e9tudie ici \u00e0 Paris. En Belgique, il y avait une expo tr\u00e8s importante et c'\u00e9tait aussi mettre de l'art partout dans la ville. Tu ne pouvais vraiment pas l'\u00e9viter. Chaque fois que tu te promenais, tu voyais un objet d'art et je trouve \u00e7a tr\u00e8s bien que l'art se rapproche des gens. Comment te sens-tu quand tu passes par cette bouche de m\u00e9tro? C\u00e9line: Plut\u00f4t de bonne humeur. \u00c7a me pla\u00eet beaucoup. Christophe: Ni bien, ni mal, \u00e7a ne provoque rien en moi, sinon un peu de col\u00e8re parce que je sais comment \u00e7a a \u00e9t\u00e9 fait. C'est une imposture, de l'art minist\u00e9riel. Il y a une volont\u00e9 d'originalit\u00e9 exacerb\u00e9e alors que c'est nul. Ce qui est dommage, c'est que les touristes un peu cons s'extasient devant \u00e7a alors qu'il y a la Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise et le Louvre \u00e0 c\u00f4t\u00e9. As-tu reconnu le soleil et la lune? C\u00e9line: Oui, c'est vrai, les couleurs chaudes pour le soleil, les couleurs froides pour la lune. Christophe: Ah oui, formidable comme symbole. M\u00ea me un peu \u00e9sot\u00e9rique. St\u00e9phanie: La lune a l'air plus grande que le soleil, il y a des personnages dessus. Mais chacun son interpr\u00e9tation de l'art. Il y a s\u00fbrement des gens qui vont voir deux coupoles kitsch et c'est tout. Quel est l'avenir de l'art dans la rue? Christophe: Avant, il y avait une bouche de m\u00e9tro en cuivre vert, Belle \u00c9poque. C'\u00e9tait assez joli. Ils auraient pu penser \u00e0 quelque chose d'un peu harmonieux avec l'ensemble. C'est pas que ce soit laid en soi, mais \u00e7a n'a rien \u00e0 faire l\u00e0. C'est une volont\u00e9 de m\u00e9lange qui est absurde. Ruth: Je pense que dans les villes comme Berlin, ils vont beaucoup plus vers cette pouss\u00e9e de l'art. \u00c0 Paris, \u00e7a a l'air d'\u00eatre le d\u00e9but. J'esp\u00e8re que \u00e7a va continuer.

      "body": "<p>To realise that Malcolm Bradbury, who died yesterday, was 68 years old, is strangely to be reminded how vividly his name is associated with youth. Although his most recently published novel, To the Hermitage, has (ominously, it now seems) an elegiac feel about its concern for reputation and achievement, much of his previous writing is pre-occupied with people at the start of their lives. The main characters of The History Man (1975) may have been adults, but their audience - and in a sense, their stimuli - were their charges: the undergraduates and postgraduates who would be the building blocks of post-war Britain. </p> <p>Malcolm had a kind of genius for seeing things in such terms. In the same way that his fiction is engrossed by the evidence of evolution, his critical writing is brilliantly alive to ideas of progress and change. And it was written in a sympathetic, complementary style: where the fiction fizzes with comic possibilities, the critical prose is measured, highly organised and - though never dull - always methodical. The two together give the impression of a man whose gifts were in perfect balance. </p> <p>And, of course, there was another gift: the gift of teaching. His arrival at the University of East Anglia, where he was appointed professor of American literature in 1970, marked the beginning of something exceptional. In those days, creative writing courses were generally sneered at by the general public (and by many academics, too), who preferred to think that good writing, if it happened at all, was likely to be produced by lonely individuals starving in attics. The MA course that Malcolm set up with Angus Wilson did more to challenge such prejudices than anything else - and now might be said to have destroyed them altogether. </p> <p>When I took over the running of the course from Malcolm on his retirement five years ago, I was in no doubt that it was - and should, in a sense, remain - \"his\". It was his foundation, and although I was bound to adapt it in certain ways, the core values that he had shaped were unquestionably good and true. He had delighted in the success of former students such as Ian McEwan (the first person to sign up) and Kazuo Ishiguro, and had appreciated that the reputation of the course depended on such conspicuous figures. </p> <p>But he had also encouraged the idea that the course could be evaluated by other means - by helping people to discover themselves in ways which might not take them on to a world of bright lights, but would make them better at whatever else they did. Better readers, better teachers, better at being decent people. </p> <p>Why? Because he himself was a person of unusually broad humanity: compassionate in his politics, generous with his time and attention, courteous in his habits, by turns amusing and grave in his talk, and expansive in his interests. Although he is associated with a particular place, his work and his sympathies depended greatly on his experience of travel. </p> <p>His legacy is highly significant and substantial. At a time when the study of literature within universities was undergoing a huge rethink (the expansion of the institutions themselves, the challenge to \"new criticism\", the arrival of critical theory), he positioned himself at the heart of all the important debates. As a novelist he was at once satirical and engaged; as a critic he was adept at fielding new ideas and expert in elucidating them; and as a teacher, he was a pioneer. </p> <p>When Malcolm left UEA he behaved impeccably, stepping back from the course and keeping a fatherly watch from afar. He never interfered, never offered unwanted advice, and was always encouraging. I felt, in our conversations about \"how things were going\" - as I suppose his students must have done - at once defended and set free. </p> <p>Like others, I had hoped that his retirement would be a great deal longer, and allow a great deal more time for the books, TV adaptations and lectures that a full-time job had kept him from writing. Yesterday's news is utterly dismal. He had already given so much, yet had so much more in him to give. </p> <p><strong>'There was a liberating feeling'</strong><br><strong>Kazuo Ishiguro</strong></p> <p>Malcolm Bradbury was a gentle, respectful teacher of creative writing. These qualities showed not just in his manner when discussing the work of students, but in the way his course was structured. No prescribed work, no exercises, no set lines, acres of time. He believed in the seminar format. Perhaps this was because, as a shy man, he wasn't comfortable with one-to-one sessions; more likely, he felt the seminar would prevent unbalanced responses to a person's work. </p> <p>He always discouraged dogmatic stances; the emphasis was always the diversity of what constituted good writing. There was a liberating feeling that you could turn up with almost any kind of writing - an intense Joycean monologue, a gritty slice of northern realism, a piece of soft porn - and he would insist the group look at it with seriousness and evaluate it on its own terms. </p> <p>Two things he used to say in those groups have remained with me over the years. \"Never assume that English is the only language,\" he muttered one afternoon, lighting his pipe. And perhaps, most important of all, his gently asserted refrain, that a person could only become a \"real\" writer by \"discovering his or her own voice\". </p> <p>He never took the easy way out by falsely flattering writers. But he was generous as a tutor, and, unsurprisingly, generous in the wider world as a critic. Perhaps he did do hatchet jobs, but in the 20 years since I ceased to be his student, I never came across any. </p> <p>I remember once finding him at a party in the mid-80s, extremely despondent after reading a scathing Martin Amis review of his Rates of Exchange. But then 10 years later, when following the publication of Amis's The Information, it seemed to be open season for attacking Martin, I noticed a glowing review in the Times - penned by Malcolm.

The face has a vague familiarity; Howard recalls that this depressed-looking figure is a lecturer in the English department, a man who, 10 years earlier, had produced two tolerably well known and acceptably reviewed novels, filled, as novels then were, with moral scruple and concern.</p> <p>\"Since then there has been silence, as if, under the pressure of contemporary change, there was no more moral scruple and concern, no new substance to be spun. The man alone persists; he passes nervously through the campus, he teaches, sadly, he avoids strangers.\"</p> <p>In these words, Sir Malcolm Bradbury, who has died aged 68, made his own Hitchcockian, though uncharacteristically reclusive, appearance in The History Man, his greatest and most influential novel. His death marks the close of half a century of academic and literary history, of which he was par excellence the chronicler.</p> <p>Malcolm Bradbury was born in Sheffield, the son of Arthur Bradbury, a railway worker, and his wife Doris, and grew up in Nottingham, where he attended West Bridgford grammar school. He took a first-class degree in English at the then fairly new University of Leicester, and did postgraduate work at Queen Mary College, London, at Manchester and in the United States, before taking up his first full-time appointment in 1959, in the adult education department at Hull University.</p> <p>In 1961, he moved to the English department of Birmingham University, where he met another recently- appointed lecturer, David Lodge, with whom he was to form a long and close friendship and amiable rivalry. In 1965, he joined the new University of East Anglia, and, in 1970, became professor of American studies; he was to remain in Norwich for the rest of his life.</p> <p>Bradbury was a prolific writer - as an academic critic, as a novelist and humorist, and for television, a medium which increasingly fascinated him. His many critical works included The Modern American Novel (1983), No, Not Bloomsbury and The Modern World: Ten Great Writers (both 1987), From Puritanism To Postmodernism: A History Of American Literature (with Richard Ruland, 1991) and Dangerous Pilgrimages (1995).</p> <p>He also edited The Penguin Book Of Modern British Short Stories (1987) and The Atlas of Literature (1996), to which he was also a major contributor over an astonishingly wide range of topics. His original television dramas included the two four-part series, The Gravy Train (1990) and The Gravy Train Goes East (1991), both sharp and uncomfortably accurate satires on the politics of the European Community, as well as Cuts (1996), which contrasted the visible consumption of television companies with the starvation of universities in an age of sado-monetarism.</p> <p>Apart from his original scripts, he adapted a wide range of books for television, ranging from Tom Sharpe's Porterhouse Blue and Kingsley Amis's The Green Man to Stella Gibbons's Cold Comfort Farm and the Dalziel and Pascoe novels of Reginald Hill. It is a matter of regret that his adaptation of William Cooper's Tales From Provincial Life, a novel with which he had particularly close affinities, has not yet reached the television screen.</p> <p>Bradbury, however, made no secret of the fact that fiction, and in particular the novel, was his true love. \"Like most comic novelists, I take the novel extremely seriously,\" he said. \"It is the best of all forms - open and personal, intelligent and inquiring. I value it for its scepticism, its irony and its play.\" His first novel, Eating People Is Wrong, which picked up the baton from Kingsley Amis's Lucky Jim, appeared in 1959 and was an instant success - though it owed more to American writers like Trilling and Bellow than to Amis.</p> <p>From then on, his novels appeared at the rate of roughly one a decade, with Stepping Westward (1965), The History Man (1975), Rates Of Exchange (1982), Dr Criminale (1992) and To the Hermitage (2000), based on Diderot's visit to the court of Catherine the Great, a brilliant departure from the form which he had made so much his own.</p> <p>In almost all of Bradbury's novels, the most frequently recurring theme is that of the slightly naive, liberal innocent, usually an academic, hilariously abroad in an unfamiliar, and occasionally slightly threatening, context, a theme which developed naturally from his frequent foreign travels, often under the auspices of the British Council. In Rates Of Exchange, the imaginary Slakan language was largely invented over several years by the combined contributions of the polyglot participants of the council's annual Cambridge seminar of contemporary writing, of which Bradbury was the founder and, for many years, chairman.</p> <p>Of all his novels, however, it was The History Man by which he will be most lastingly remembered, and which indeed was one of the outstanding novels of its decade. It charts the successful career of the manipulative and promiscuous radical sociologist, Howard Kirk, at the new University of Watermouth (which bears more than a passing resemblance to East Anglia), and satirises savagely his substitution of \"trends for morals and commitments\".</p> <p>Kirk moves through the university like a Marxist Iago, wrecking careers, corrupting innocence and generally subverting stability in the name of history. \"I know how your aggression operates,\" one of his more perceptive colleagues tells him. \"If you wanted someone through a window, you wouldn't push him yourself. You'd get someone else to do it. Or persuade the man he should do it himself, in his own best interests.\"</p> <p>All Bradbury's novels, for all their surface wit and comedy, have serious moral and philosophical subtexts; in The History Man the wit is darker, the satire more biting, the atmosphere more menacing and the conclusion more hopeless. Bradbury was always fascinated by the experimental fictive techniques of contemporary American novelists, and The History Man shows a marked development in his own writing in its unvaried use of a present tense, which reports without comment or analysis the speech and actions of the characters. The technique adds menace to the atmosphere of alienation and moral nihilism.</p> <p>Bradbury's contribution to the literary life of his time was as extraordinary as his prolific output, and deserves equal notice. He will be properly remembered for his part, with Angus Wilson, in founding in 1970 - and, for many years, teaching - the creative writing programme at East Anglia. At the time the only MA of standing in the subject in Britain, and today, in spite of many imitators, still the most distinguished - not least in the number of distinguished writers it can claim as graduates - it did much to allay the suspicions of such courses.</p> <p>His generosity to all literary ventures he regarded as worthy was remarkable, and his inability to reject appeals for help was a severe trial to his agent. The list of organisations to which he was prepared to give precious time was impressive, and included the Booker Prize management committee, the British Association for American Studies, the SDP arts policy committee, the Eastern Arts Association, the King's Lynn literary festival and the Norwich festival.</p> <p>To few, however, did Bradbury give as much time and attention as he did to the affairs of the British Council, of whose literary work, at one time very much under threat of abolition, he was an invaluable supporter. Apart from serving as a foundation member of its literary advisory committee, he was single-handedly responsible for transforming its contemporary writing seminar, the chairmanship of which he took over in 1976, from a rather routine English studies event into one which brought together writers, translators, journalists, publishers and academics from all over the world to meet British writers, many of whom found foreign translators and publishers at it.</p> <p>The seminar took place during an annual fortnight in a Cambridge college, and was conducted, in sympathy with his own love of parties, in appropriately carnival conditions. After relinquishing the chairmanship to Christopher Bigsby in 1984, Bradbury continued to revisit the seminar every year to give readings, his visits invariably providing an occasion for a party of Bradburyesque proportions.</p> <p>His tours overseas for the council, many of which reappeared transmogrified in his novels, were invariably marked by unscheduled revelry, as well as by serious literary discussions. After retirement in 1995, he found a new platform, and a new source of conviviality, as a guest lecturer on Swan Hellenic cruises.</p> <p>When the British Council's literature department decided to produce an annual anthology of the most recent British writing it could use to publicise new young writers abroad, it was natural for it to look first to Malcolm Bradbury for help and encouragement, and as an editor of the first two volumes (1992 and 1993). This was a time when the publication of an anthology launched under the council's auspices was hardly calculated to produce favour- able reviews, however illustrious the editor.</p> <p>It was largely due to his support that New Writing (named, at his suggestion, in honour of John Lehmann's earlier venture) survived a difficult birth, and went on to become one of the few refuges for the short story in the 1990s. Many of his own creative writing graduates first published in the series.</p> <p>If he was preeminently a gregarious man, happiest in the social context of conferences, seminars and meetings, and generous with his friendship, Bradbury was even more markedly a devoted family man. In 1959, he married Elizabeth Salt, who was, throughout his life, the greatest single source of happiness and support to him, and by whom he had two sons. He was appointed CBE in 1991, for services to literature, and was knighted in 2000.</p> <p>Literary London is much the poorer for the loss of its own History Man, and of a voice unequalled for its humanity and wit.</p> <p>\u0095 Malcolm Stanley Bradbury, writer and teacher, born September 7 1932; died November 27 2000</p>",

At Meldreth, the programme is tailored to meet the needs of the pupils.\"</p> <p>Ivy Bank High School in Burnley won the secondary award, which Doran will present today during the school's special assembly held to mark World Aids Day. Richard Burbery, head of PSHE at the school, ensures that sex education is broadly balanced and well integrated. All pupils at key stage 3 undertake an hour's sex education a week, and all teachers attend training.</p> <p>One of the judging criteria for the award is evidence of a commitment to challenging sexism, racism and homophobia, and Burbery says this is important. \"We start by turning the tables, getting the pupils to question the reasons behind prejudices. This leads into group discussions, throwing up views that may need to be challenged. From there we're able to introduce role play, videos, quizzes or written work to get the pupils to really empathise with the targets of such prejudice,\" Burbery says.</p> <p>Involvement is a high priority at Ivy Bank. Recently, the school held an evening specifically for parents to explain the sex education programme.</p> <p>And Burbery is always seeking to improve provision. One idea is to trail single-sex groups at the top end of the school, which could be beneficial in discussing such issues as contraception, especially with boys, who tend to \"switch off\", Burbery says.</p> <p>Local greengrocers had best stock up on those courgettes.</p> <p>The FPA will be providing guidance for teachers in the near future.

Meldreth Manor won the special education award because of the positive approach taken to teaching sex education to pupils with a range of learning and physical difficulties. \"There's a tendency with some schools of this nature to view sex education as simply about guarding pupils against the dangers of abuse. At Meldreth, the programme is tailored to meet the needs of the pupils.\" Ivy Bank High School in Burnley won the secondary award, which Doran will present today during the school's special assembly held to mark World Aids Day. Richard Burbery, head of PSHE at the school, ensures that sex education is broadly balanced and well integrated. All pupils at key stage 3 undertake an hour's sex education a week, and all teachers attend training. One of the judging criteria for the award is evidence of a commitment to challenging sexism, racism and homophobia, and Burbery says this is important. \"We start by turning the tables, getting the pupils to question the reasons behind prejudices. This leads into group discussions, throwing up views that may need to be challenged. From there we're able to introduce role play, videos, quizzes or written work to get the pupils to really empathise with the targets of such prejudice,\" Burbery says. Involvement is a high priority at Ivy Bank. Recently, the school held an evening specifically for parents to explain the sex education programme. And Burbery is always seeking to improve provision. One idea is to trail single-sex groups at the top end of the school, which could be beneficial in discussing such issues as contraception, especially with boys, who tend to \"switch off\", Burbery says. Local greengrocers had best stock up on those courgettes. The FPA will be providing guidance for teachers in the near future. Visit www.fpa.org.uk or call 0845 310 1334. See First Edition, page 54",

However, the Treasury dismissed suggestions that as much as half of all income tax should be earmarked for an NHS tax. The health secretary, Alan Milburn, is also no longer an anthusiast. </p> <p>Research published at the weekend by the independent taxation commission, established by the leftwing think tank Fabian Society, shows that government anxiety over income tax has forced it to place an excessive emphasis on indirect taxes such as VAT. </p> <p>The inquiry proposes an NHS tax explicitly funded from general tax, building on tax duties earmarked for health and congestion charges for transport. A member of the commission, Julian Le Grand, said an earmarked NHS tax would make both the public and the electorate accountable for the state of the NHS. He added it would allow other public services to be better funded since at present the NHS is taking up more and more of the tax take. </p> <p>The inquiry criticises the Labour government for failing to challenge the prevailing orthodoxy that taxation is in itself illegitimate. It says taxes are never going to be popular, but accuses Labour \"of acting as if proposals to raise taxes cannot win votes\". The inquiry also says that the\"prevailing political orthodoxy\" on tax means the poor are paying proportionately more than the rich in tax. </p> <p>Between 1978 and 1998-99, the richest fifth have seen their share of the nation's post-tax income rise from 36% to 45%. This is partly due to successive cuts in income tax - now only 26% of total tax revenues - and the increasing importance of indirect tax. </p> <p>The bottom fifth of the income distribution pay around 28% of their gross income in indirect taxes, such as VAT or petrol duties, compared to only 12% of the top fifth. </p> <p>The injustice is only removed when the distributional impact of public spending is also taken into account. Around half of the gross income of the bottom 40% of the income distribution comes from the state. </p> <p>Apart from the earmarked NHS tax, the report calls for a 50% top rate of tax applied to taxable incomes of more than \u00a3100,000 a year, a proposal rejected by Tony Blair and the chancellor, Gordon Brown, be fore the last election. The higher rate tax would raise \u00a32.9bn and affect 200,000. The money would finance an increase in the personal allowance by \u00a3250 and an increase in the threshold for the 40% rate to \u00a330,000 taxable income from the present \u00a328,400. </p> <p>The commission also proposes that the rich pay higher council tax, a flat rate personal allowance and realignment of the national insurance upper earnings limit with the higher rate of tax. </p> <p>Polls commisioned by the Inquiry found that 80% would prefer extra public spending to tax cuts. Asked separately whether they would like a 1p increase in unspecified public spending, 40% said yes. Asked if they would like the money devoted to the NHS, 80% said yes and asked if they would like the money go to education, 68% replied positively. </p> <p>Labour strategists have been wary of such poll findings, arguing that they are not borne out in the polling on election day. The strategists point to separate poll findings published by the inquiry suggesting voters believe taxes are too high, and do not support an inheritance tax. But the commission argues that most people suffer a deep sense of disconnection from the taxes they pay and the public services which these finance. </p> <p>The Treasury, and a minority of the Fabian Society inquiry rteam members, oppose earmarked taxes on the grounds that they reduce the flexibility flexibility within the tax system. Opponents also fear that if the NHS tax revenues are registered separately - either through pay slips or by separate taxes linked to specific revenue stream - then other taxes for less popular services will become more difficult to raise. </p> <p>The inquiry suggests the current state of public revenues are good enough not to require short term tax rises. But it points out that public spending as a proportion of GDP - 40.5% - will be lower at the end of the period 2001-4 than when the Conservatives left office in 1996-7. </p> <p>It also points out that the proportion of national income taken in taxes in the UK is 6% lower than the EU average. Only Ireland and Spain have lower overall tax rates. </p> <p>The inquiry, chaired by Lord Plant of Highfield, who was responsible for an earlier influential Labour party report on electoral systems, suggests that confidence in public spending has also been undermined by the way in which the government publishes self-congratulatory annual reports on its own activities. </p> <p>The commission suggests that such reports are worthless in an age when government is not trusted.

Robin Allen, Ms Bahl's QC, told the tribunal: \"The conclusion she bullied is something which she very much disagrees with. The applicant does not accept she was a bully, she doesn't accept the conclusions reached by Lord Griffiths.\" Ms Bahl alleges that after she announced she was launching a sex and race discrimination claim against the society, she was victimised and then treated in such a way that she was entitled to resign and claim compensation for unfair dismissal. A few days after the Griffiths report the council voted in her absence to suspend her. In preparation for a special general meeting of the whole profession to decide whether to expel her, copies of the Griffiths report were sent to all 80,000 solicitors. Before the meeting could be held, she resigned. The tribunal hearing, adjourned yesterday after legal argument, resumes today.",

      "bodyText": "A sharp increase in the number of Little Englanders who do not identify themselves as British and tend towards racist and xenophobic views is disclosed today by the National Centre for Social Research in its annual survey of social attitudes. As power devolved to Scotland and Wales over the first two years of Tony Blair's government, the proportion of English people saying they owed allegiance to England, not Britain, grew from 7% to 17%. The researchers discovered no evidence of resentment in England about power passing to the Scottish parliament and Welsh assembly, but the figures suggested that 6m adults in England no longer subscribed to a British national identity. More than a third of this group (37%) freely admitted to being racially prejudiced, compared with 17% of those who continued to assert their Britishness. They were also much more likely to think that immigrants take jobs away from people who were born in Britain (70%), that it was \"bad\" that people from ethnic minorities were getting ahead (26%), and that attempts to give equal opportunities to blacks and Asians in Britain had \"gone too far\" (46%). The Little Englanders were also more likely to say it mattered a great deal to being English that people were white and born in England, with English parents. Nearly threequarters (73%) wanted to keep the pound as Britain's only currency and 22% thought Britain should quit the EU altogether - a much more strongly Eurosceptic stance than among those acknowledging British nationhood. The survey by John Curtice, of Strathclyde University, and Anthony Heath, of Oxford University, concluded: \"We have found that those who feel English are indeed different from those who feel British, being consistently more inclined to want to shut out the outside world.

More than half would be \"neither pleased nor sorry\" if Scotland were to become completely independent. A fifth of English people wanted independence for Wales, either inside or outside the EU. And a majority (54%) thought Northern Ireland's long-term interests would be with the rest of Ireland rather than as part of Britain. But these reformist views did not lead to any great appetite for devolution within England, where 15% favoured regional assemblies and 18% wanted an English parliament. \"This is probably why the somewhat muted attempts by the Conservative party to identify itself as the party of English interests have met with an even more muted response,\" the study said. One reason why English nationalism might struggle to assert itself was a lack of potent symbols belonging to exclusively England after centuries of intertwined British culture. More than half thought fox hunting and Guy Fawkes night were English rather than British institutions. Paradoxically, a third thought the same about the Houses of Parliament, the centre of the British democratic state. The survey, based on more than 3,000 interviews with a representative random sample of people in England, Scotland and Wales, was the 17th in the British social attitudes series.",

The move is part of an attempt by owner Seagram to appeal to a younger drinker in an increasingly difficult whisky market. The company has already launched an advertising campaign and has revamped sister brand Chivas Regal 12 in a bid to make the whisky trendier. Chivas Regal is a premium blended Scotch whisky whose main competitor is Johnny Walker, owned by UDV. Seagram launched the 18-year-old version, Chivas Regal 18, three years ago in the US and it has since been introduced in Japan and Latin America. It is now gearing up for a Europe-wide launch. The whisky market has been declining in recent years as young consumers gravitate towards white spirits such as vodka and tequila. The difficulty for whisky manufacturers is how to attract younger drinkers without alienating their core market. The new design, created by brand consultancy Identica, will aim to give the 18-year-old whisky a more sophisticated look. Seagram Scotch Whiskies marketing manager Gustavo Clauss said: \"Chivas Regal 18's new design captures the distinctive qualities of Chivas Regal, while informing the customer of the rare and special status of this premium whisky. \"By adding to the brand's aura of quality and heritage, we are seeking to build on the success of Chivas Regal and reinforce the brand's position as the perfect gift for the sophisticated whisky drinker.\" Seagram is trying to sell all its drinks brands to concentrate on its entertainment businesses.",

      "body": "<p>A senior Israeli general waged a lonely battle yesterday to erase the stain that is the emblem of the Palestinian intifada: the terrified 12-year-old boy shot dead in his father's arms.</p> <p>At a Tel Aviv press conference, Major-General Yom-Tov Samia, the commander of Israeli forces in Gaza, where Mohammed al-Durreh was killed on September 30, released the results of an investigation that purports to clear his soldiers of the boy's death.</p> <p>\"A comprehensive investigation conducted in the last weeks casts serious doubts that the boy was hit by Israel defence forces' fire,\" his report said. \"It is quite plausible that the boy was hit by Palestinian bullets.\"</p> <p>Even in Israeli army circles, the investigation has become controversial, disowned by the chief of staff and criticised by MPs for compounding the army's biggest public relations disaster of recent months.</p> <p>None of the more than 280 killed in the past two months has haunted Israel as deeply as Mohammed al-Durreh. His killing, opposite an army post at Netzarim junction, was captured in horrifying detail by a television cameraman, the most damning piece of evidence for charges by interna tional human rights organisations that Israeli soldiers have killed children and used excessive force against Palestinian protesters.</p> <p>The death also became the engine of the protests, which have given way in recent weeks to well-planned guerrilla attacks on Israeli soldiers and Jewish settlers in the West Bank and Gaza.</p> <p>Yesterday, the start of Ramadan, brought no respite.

      "bodyText": "A senior Israeli general waged a lonely battle yesterday to erase the stain that is the emblem of the Palestinian intifada: the terrified 12-year-old boy shot dead in his father's arms. At a Tel Aviv press conference, Major-General Yom-Tov Samia, the commander of Israeli forces in Gaza, where Mohammed al-Durreh was killed on September 30, released the results of an investigation that purports to clear his soldiers of the boy's death. \"A comprehensive investigation conducted in the last weeks casts serious doubts that the boy was hit by Israel defence forces' fire,\" his report said. \"It is quite plausible that the boy was hit by Palestinian bullets.\" Even in Israeli army circles, the investigation has become controversial, disowned by the chief of staff and criticised by MPs for compounding the army's biggest public relations disaster of recent months. None of the more than 280 killed in the past two months has haunted Israel as deeply as Mohammed al-Durreh. His killing, opposite an army post at Netzarim junction, was captured in horrifying detail by a television cameraman, the most damning piece of evidence for charges by interna tional human rights organisations that Israeli soldiers have killed children and used excessive force against Palestinian protesters. The death also became the engine of the protests, which have given way in recent weeks to well-planned guerrilla attacks on Israeli soldiers and Jewish settlers in the West Bank and Gaza. Yesterday, the start of Ramadan, brought no respite. Israeli officials expect the violence to rise during the Muslim holy month. Despite the weekend's meetings between Israeli and Palestinian security officials, there were bursts of gunfire near the city of Bethlehem last night, and continued recrimination over the death of five Palestinian men near Qalqilya. Israel accused the men of plotting attacks on settlers; the Palestinians said they were killed in cold blood. Millions of television viewers watched Mohammed al-Durreh's final moments. Although the Israeli army apologised days later, and admitted that its soldiers probably killed the boy, Gen Samia argued yesterday that it, and television viewers, all came to the same, wrong conclusion: that his men fired the fatal bullets. Gen Samia's investigation makes no pretence at being thorough or impartial. He called it a \"moral exercise\", intended to show that \"we are not the army that kills kids just like that\". He went on: \"A picture was presented that turned things upside down, as if the Palestinians were the good guys and we were the violent ones.\" But Gen Samia's investigation is arguably fatally flawed, since it was conducted under his direct supervision, even though, as Gaza commander, he is the man ultimately responsible for the boy's death. He also admitted yesterday that the Israeli army \"unintentionally destroyed\" crucial evidence from the scene by razing the bullet-scarred concrete water butt and cinderblock wall where father and son vainly sought shelter. His investigation made no use of the medical records for Mohammed, who was treated at Shifa hospital in Gaza, or his father, Jamal, who survived after being hit by eight bullets. There was no postmortem examination. It did not interview the Palestinian cameraman who recorded the death for French television. According to Charles Ender lin, the Israeli bureau chief for France 2 TV, it took more than three weeks for investigators to pick up a copy of the video cassette. The army built its case on an elaborate re-enactment of the boy's death, for which the cinderblock wall rebuilt, and on analysis of the angle of gunfire, based on frozen images from the footage of Mohammed's death. It also suggests that Jamal al-Durreh was a suspected collaborator, whose death could have been sought by the Palestinians, and blames the father and other locals for failing to rescue the boy. The general said the bullet holes in the wall suggested that father and son were out of range of most of the soldiers firing from the Israeli bunker, and that it was \"plausible\" that they were shot by Palestinian gunmen firing from the side.",

      "body": "<p>Gerard Donaghey was dressed in his weekend gear: a pair of tight Wrangler jeans, size 34 waist, 29 leg, and a matching denim jacket, a blue shirt and a blue jumper. He was 17 and had got his first job as a storeman in the Carling brewery in Londonderry. He liked keeping himself smart.</p> <p>He sent his elder sister, Mary, a letter from prison asking her to buy the Wranglers out of his credit union savings. He had been released five weeks before Bloody Sunday, having served a six-month sentence for throwing stones at British soldiers - the mandatory term for the offence. And he had joined the Fianna, the young IRA.</p> <p>Donaghey said he would have his rice pudding when he got back from the anti-internment march. He left the flat carrying his roll-up tobacco and lighter in his hand. His Wranglers were too tight to get anything into his pockets - even small change.</p> <p>The city coroner would remark afterwards that the autopsies showed that most of the 13 bodies had soup and potatoes in their stomachs. Sunday lunch was important in the Londonderry ghetto of the Bogside. Afterwards the women who spent most of the week working in the shirt factories and producing between six and 10 children went to the cemetery to get away from their kids and have a cigarette in peace.</p> <p>It was January 1972, the year Nixon faced Watergate and Mark Spitz won seven golds at the Munich Olympics. Twenty-nine years later, a \u00a310m public inquiry into what happened will hear for the first time this week from the families of the dead and wounded. Their words will be recorded by stenographers using the computer software developed during the OJ Simpson trial.</p> <p>Over the next year, three judges from Britain, Australia and Canada will preside over the presentation of 1,500 statements from the families of the victims, clergymen, soldiers, journalists and photographers. Already, the opening testimony of the Bloody Sunday tribunal is the longest in British legal history, lasting for 38 days and going on for one and a quarter million words.</p> <p>About the same time that Donaghey was leaving the flat, Private 027 was pacing about the cement covered yard of the Protestant church on William Street. He was a radio operator with 1 Para, of the Parachute Regiment. Brutalised by Belfast and Aden, the Parachute Regiment provided the shock troops of the British army. They were brought in from Belfast specially for the Bloody Sunday march.</p> <p>This is the story of the Paratrooper and the Rioter: a snippet of the 70,000 pages of evidence submitted to the inquiry. Two men, one 17, one 19, whose paths almost crossed one January Sunday in a place in and around Glenfada Park North.</p> <p>Today Glenfada Park is surrounded on three sides by murky puddles and maisonettes with cracked windowpanes and peeling paint. On a nearby wall a giant mural of an IRA hunger striker shows him watched over by the long suffering Mother Ireland. Except for the video rental shop on the corner and a bullet hole in one wall the size of a small orange, it looks much as it did when Donaghey ran through it trying to escape from Private 027 and his unit.</p> <p>Private 027 had been with the paratroopers in Belfast for six months. Their most dangerous enemies were the IRA snipers. \"We were under sustained stress, playing mind games with an ephemeral enemy. Living in that environment gave rise to the expression 'Going ape'. Another term used was 'beasting', when pent-up tensions were released ... The prospect of going to Derry was regarded with some relish. There was the anticipation that we were about to be given the opportunity to confront the enemy,\" he said.</p> <p>Except that the enemy - the IRA - had promised the organisers they would take the weapons out of the area for the march. At least one IRA man, however, did fire at least one shot at soldiers. The Guardian's Simon Winchester, who was there, wrote afterwards: \"Most of us believed there had been one shot fired around 4pm.\" He also said the paratroopers came under machine gun fire after they started firing at the crowd.</p> <p>British government officials had considered other ways of dealing with the young men like Donaghey who offended the sensibilities of the army and Protestant businessmen by declaring their ghetto \"Free Derry\". The no-go area was creeping street by street into the city centre. Another day, and the rubble barricade separating \"Free Derry\" from the army-controlled centre of town moved a couple of yards closer. A secret foreign office memo written by Adrian Thorpe, then 29 and now the British ambassador in Mexico, had included other observations on how to deal with Londonderry's troublesome Catholics: \"Have always been in favour of encouraging the no-go areas to rot from within. There is no reason why we should not encourage the breakdown of essential services and the spread of disease etc.\"</p> <p>The new military commander in Northern Ireland, Major General Robert Ford, recommended another strategy in a private memo to his commander, General Tuzo: \"I am coming to the conclusion that the minimum force necessary to achieve the restoration of law and order is to shoot selected ringleaders.\"</p> <p>Even that had fallen short of the demands of the Protestant businessmen in the town who met with Ford two weeks before the march, asking him to clear the Rossville flats at the heart of the no-go area where 5,000 people lived. \"They also wanted curfews and shooting on sight,\" according to a confidential memo to Tuzo, written just before 1 Para was ordered from Belfast to Londonderry.</p> <p>When Private 027 left the army, he took a cardboard box with him full of mementos and notes of his two years with the paratroopers. It included his diary of Bloody Sunday.</p> <p>\"We had blackened faces. We knew we were going through the rubble barricade, which was drawn back for us. I remember the intense feeling of adrenalin as we were swept along with events ... I do not think that anyone with any level of authority knew exactly what we were going to do after that. I think it was pretty clear that we were there for a special occasion ... 1 Para was the 'Rot tweiler' of the British army - as a unit is one of a range of tools for those in authority to choose from. If misapplied or directed either by senior commander or politicians, then that is where the responsibility must lay.\"</p> <p>Donaghey, like most of Londonderry in 1972, went from school to the barricades to stone soldiers. In the Guild Hall in Londonderry today there are people - even among the legal teams and journalists - who were probably throwing stones that day. Catholics couldn't vote because many were too poor to own their own house and pay rates; a corrupt city council gerrymandered in favour of the Protestant population.</p> <p>Civil rights were on the agenda in Londonderry just like everywhere else. Internment without trial polarised the British-backed Protestant ruling class and the rowdy, increasingly dangerous Catholics. Hundreds of young men were joining the Fianna - though Donaghey was the only one of the dead with any military links.</p> <p>After Bloody Sunday, more than 270 people died in the worst single year of the troubles. A month after Bloody Sunday the official IRA, in what they said was a revenge attack, blew up a priest, a gardener and five cleaning women at the officers' mess of the 16th Parachute Regiment in Aldershot: women not unlike the Londonderry mothers and sisters who escaped to the cemetery on Sunday afternoons for a break from their children.</p> <p>While Donaghey, the storeman, was waiting to be called up for the great fight for Irish freedom, he was seeing a girl called Hester, who was a Protestant. He was planning to propose to her.</p> <p>Private 027 had no Hesters in his life. Belfast was a dangerous place for British soldiers. They were confined to base, sealed into a surreal and violent macho world with its own rites of passage. \"Soon after arriving in Belfast, I received a beating from an individual who lived in a world I can't comprehend. He had all the attributes of a para: efficient soldier, excellent shot, and a top recruit.</p> <p>\"One day he took a sub-machine gun from the barracks and tried to rob a post office in Belfast. He was given five years and was dishonourably discharged.\" There were others that Private 027 remembers: a corporal called 036 who shot a Chinese waiter after a fight over the bill - and was considered a hero.</p> <p>Private 027 recalled a discussion from before 1 Para left their army base for Londonderry: \"I have a clear memory in my section of seven or eight of us being in barracks in our denims and T-shirts. Our platoon lieutenant came in. I don't remember all that was said at that meeting, but I remember it revolving around the possibility of getting 'some kills' the following day.\"</p> <p>The highly paid, high profile barristers appearing in the Guildhall to represent the families of the dead are attempting to prove that the decision to send 1 Para into Londonderry was approved at the highest political level, that it went as far as the then British prime minister, Edward Heath. They insist that there would be no record of such a dramatic change in policy but claim that the architect, Maj Gen Ford, could not have sent his soldiers in on such a controversial mission without high level approval. Heath says he never saw any such memo and will come to the tribunal next year to testify.</p> <p>On paper, hints that the army was about to resort to illegal means to subdue Londonderry made it as far as the high-level joint security committee. Its members included army and police chiefs and Heath's security adviser, who were told: \"Following a meeting of local businessmen, certain measures were in mind with a view to putting down the troublesome hooligan element there. It may be very difficult to solve within the law.\"</p> <p>Private 027 doesn't read or write memos, but he was there when Ford cheered his men into the Bogside: \"Go paras, go go go!\"</p> <p>\"I ran along the right-hand side of Rossville Street hunched over in anticipation of incoming fire,\" said Private 027. \"I have no recollection now of any shots striking the road in front of me, but there may have been ... As one of my section reached the pavement ... he went down in a kneeling position, raised his rifle to his shoulder and without pause or hesitation commenced firing towards the centre of the crowd ... Within seconds other soldiers came on the scene, some kneeling, some standing, joining in the firing ... two people at the centre of the barricade that had been facing us fell within seconds of each other.</p> <p>\"One chap, I think he was a full colonel, ran up beside me pushing his way between two other soldiers who were firing, so that he could commence firing himself. He indicated to me that he thought what was happening was great. He was exuberant. I was as keen to find a target as anyone, but I did not see anyone with a weapon or an explosive device.</p> <p>\"I lowered my weapon and looked at the guys firing. I have a clear memory of consciously thinking: what are they firing at? - and feeling some inadequacy. What was I not seeing that I ought to be seeing ... I had the distinct impression that this was a case of some soldiers realising this was their opportunity to fire their weapons and they didn't want to miss the chance.</p> <p>\"I received a ceasefire order over the radio from Major Looden. I clearly recall him shouting, 'cease fire, cease fire'. I shouted out the order several times and moved from my position to the soldiers near me and tapped some men on the shoulder and shouted the order.\"</p> <p>At least nine people had already been shot dead and a dozen injured by the time Donaghey ran into the grimy complex of maisonettes known as Glenfada Park North with dozens of others - all trying to escape the paratroopers.</p> <p>After the ceasefire, Private 027's statement to the tribunal said the paratroopers kept killing. \"As far as I am concerned, what occurred after the ceasefire was initiated by Lance Corporal F and Soldier G, who had a preconceived notion of what they were going to do that day. I thought it was their aggressive positive actions that incited a few other loonies to join in.\" The soldiers insist they found themselves at the centre of an IRA ambush.</p> <p>\"As I came on the scene there was at least one body down,\" Private 027 continued. \"I saw a crowd of about 40 shocked and terrified people ... trying to get away. Some were frozen in a static huddle. I saw no civilians with weapons, no threatening gestures. I have an image of watching men about 10 metres away from me carrying the bodies away.</p> <p>\"I remember that the man in the pale grey guit was the last to be removed. I watched men in donkey jackets and flat caps who were very close to me, pick up the body and walk away. I remember wondering if I was supposed to be shooting these people.\"</p> <p>Nine people were shot in Glenfada Park after the ceasefire. Four of them died there.</p> <p>Donaghey was carried three doors away into the house of Raymond Rogan, chairman of the Bogside tennis association. Donaghey had been shot in the abdomen and was bleeding to death. Rogan tried to drive him to hospital but the car was stopped by soldiers.</p> <p>He explained that Donaghey was wounded and needed to get to hospital. \"Let the bastard die,\" said the soldier. A nurse approached and asked if she could help and the soldier, in his own admission, said: \"'Fuck off Florence, this one is shitted.' I do not know if he was actually dead but he looked like he was.\"</p> <p>The soldiers on the barricade then forced Rogan out, commandeered his car with the dying Donaghey inside and took him to a military headquarters, and from there to a detention centre. When his brother-in-law was called to pick up the body, four nailbombs, each roughly the size of half a brick, were lodged in the pockets of the jeans - the same Wranglers that couldn't take a pack of roll-ups.</p> <p>Rogan said: \"If Gerard Donaghey had bombs on him I would never have taken him in the house. It is one thing being helpful trying to save someone's life - it is another thing to put other people at risk, especially family. No way would I have brought him in.\"</p> <p>Another neighbour, Leo Young, who helped carry Donaghey out, said when he was shown police photographs of his dead body with nailbombs in the pockets: \"When I saw the photograph marked 'two', I simply could not believe it. I saw his body lying in the house. I helped to carry him to the car and I sat in the car with him for 10 minutes ... I was at his head looking down at his body. There is no way I could have missed the nailbombs shown in photograph two.\"</p> <p>Private 027 spent the night after Bloody Sunday on a factory floor and early the next morning, back in Belfast, all hell was breaking loose. The army were accused of excessive force and killing civilians - but a damage limitation exercise was under way as soon as the firing stopped.</p> <p>\"Afterwards the mood in the back of the Pig [armoured car] was not so much euphoria as release of tension. There was almost a silence and a sort of feeling - Bloody hell, what happened there ... there was already a recognition that there was a problem that had to be explained away ... The whole point of the conversation was to sort out our stories and alibis prior to the ammunition check ... There was some serious thinking going on by people wanting to cover their arses ... The line the army took, that was passed down from our superiors, was that a number of the killed had been han dling weapons ... and there was strong evidence of weapons being found on a body and that weapons had disappeared.\"</p> <p>Private 027 remembers being called in for a briefing with the army lawyers before he went in to give his evidence. \"A couple of days later I was flown in a Sioux helicopter to Coleraine ... I was called into a meeting with a lawyer. The lawyer and I sat either side of the desk and he wrote the statement as I spoke.</p> <p>\"I described shooting from the small wall by Kells Walk towards the centre of the crowd behind the rubble barricade. The lawyer stood up and expressed surprise and said something like: 'We can't have that, can we private? That makes it sound like shots were being fired into the crowd.' I was very surprised.\"</p>",

He had all the attributes of a para: efficient soldier, excellent shot, and a top recruit. \"One day he took a sub-machine gun from the barracks and tried to rob a post office in Belfast. He was given five years and was dishonourably discharged.\" There were others that Private 027 remembers: a corporal called 036 who shot a Chinese waiter after a fight over the bill - and was considered a hero. Private 027 recalled a discussion from before 1 Para left their army base for Londonderry: \"I have a clear memory in my section of seven or eight of us being in barracks in our denims and T-shirts. Our platoon lieutenant came in. I don't remember all that was said at that meeting, but I remember it revolving around the possibility of getting 'some kills' the following day.\" The highly paid, high profile barristers appearing in the Guildhall to represent the families of the dead are attempting to prove that the decision to send 1 Para into Londonderry was approved at the highest political level, that it went as far as the then British prime minister, Edward Heath. They insist that there would be no record of such a dramatic change in policy but claim that the architect, Maj Gen Ford, could not have sent his soldiers in on such a controversial mission without high level approval. Heath says he never saw any such memo and will come to the tribunal next year to testify. On paper, hints that the army was about to resort to illegal means to subdue Londonderry made it as far as the high-level joint security committee. Its members included army and police chiefs and Heath's security adviser, who were told: \"Following a meeting of local businessmen, certain measures were in mind with a view to putting down the troublesome hooligan element there. It may be very difficult to solve within the law.\" Private 027 doesn't read or write memos, but he was there when Ford cheered his men into the Bogside: \"Go paras, go go go!\" \"I ran along the right-hand side of Rossville Street hunched over in anticipation of incoming fire,\" said Private 027. \"I have no recollection now of any shots striking the road in front of me, but there may have been ... As one of my section reached the pavement ... he went down in a kneeling position, raised his rifle to his shoulder and without pause or hesitation commenced firing towards the centre of the crowd ... Within seconds other soldiers came on the scene, some kneeling, some standing, joining in the firing ... two people at the centre of the barricade that had been facing us fell within seconds of each other. \"One chap, I think he was a full colonel, ran up beside me pushing his way between two other soldiers who were firing, so that he could commence firing himself. He indicated to me that he thought what was happening was great. He was exuberant. I was as keen to find a target as anyone, but I did not see anyone with a weapon or an explosive device. \"I lowered my weapon and looked at the guys firing. I have a clear memory of consciously thinking: what are they firing at? - and feeling some inadequacy. What was I not seeing that I ought to be seeing ... I had the distinct impression that this was a case of some soldiers realising this was their opportunity to fire their weapons and they didn't want to miss the chance. \"I received a ceasefire order over the radio from Major Looden. I clearly recall him shouting, 'cease fire, cease fire'. I shouted out the order several times and moved from my position to the soldiers near me and tapped some men on the shoulder and shouted the order.\" At least nine people had already been shot dead and a dozen injured by the time Donaghey ran into the grimy complex of maisonettes known as Glenfada Park North with dozens of others - all trying to escape the paratroopers. After the ceasefire, Private 027's statement to the tribunal said the paratroopers kept killing. \"As far as I am concerned, what occurred after the ceasefire was initiated by Lance Corporal F and Soldier G, who had a preconceived notion of what they were going to do that day. I thought it was their aggressive positive actions that incited a few other loonies to join in.\" The soldiers insist they found themselves at the centre of an IRA ambush. \"As I came on the scene there was at least one body down,\" Private 027 continued. \"I saw a crowd of about 40 shocked and terrified people ... trying to get away. Some were frozen in a static huddle. I saw no civilians with weapons, no threatening gestures. I have an image of watching men about 10 metres away from me carrying the bodies away. \"I remember that the man in the pale grey guit was the last to be removed. I watched men in donkey jackets and flat caps who were very close to me, pick up the body and walk away. I remember wondering if I was supposed to be shooting these people.\" Nine people were shot in Glenfada Park after the ceasefire. Four of them died there. Donaghey was carried three doors away into the house of Raymond Rogan, chairman of the Bogside tennis association. Donaghey had been shot in the abdomen and was bleeding to death. Rogan tried to drive him to hospital but the car was stopped by soldiers. He explained that Donaghey was wounded and needed to get to hospital. \"Let the bastard die,\" said the soldier. A nurse approached and asked if she could help and the soldier, in his own admission, said: \"'Fuck off Florence, this one is shitted.' I do not know if he was actually dead but he looked like he was.\" The soldiers on the barricade then forced Rogan out, commandeered his car with the dying Donaghey inside and took him to a military headquarters, and from there to a detention centre. When his brother-in-law was called to pick up the body, four nailbombs, each roughly the size of half a brick, were lodged in the pockets of the jeans - the same Wranglers that couldn't take a pack of roll-ups. Rogan said: \"If Gerard Donaghey had bombs on him I would never have taken him in the house. It is one thing being helpful trying to save someone's life - it is another thing to put other people at risk, especially family. No way would I have brought him in.\" Another neighbour, Leo Young, who helped carry Donaghey out, said when he was shown police photographs of his dead body with nailbombs in the pockets: \"When I saw the photograph marked 'two', I simply could not believe it. I saw his body lying in the house. I helped to carry him to the car and I sat in the car with him for 10 minutes ... I was at his head looking down at his body. There is no way I could have missed the nailbombs shown in photograph two.\" Private 027 spent the night after Bloody Sunday on a factory floor and early the next morning, back in Belfast, all hell was breaking loose. The army were accused of excessive force and killing civilians - but a damage limitation exercise was under way as soon as the firing stopped. \"Afterwards the mood in the back of the Pig [armoured car] was not so much euphoria as release of tension. There was almost a silence and a sort of feeling - Bloody hell, what happened there ... there was already a recognition that there was a problem that had to be explained away ... The whole point of the conversation was to sort out our stories and alibis prior to the ammunition check ... There was some serious thinking going on by people wanting to cover their arses ... The line the army took, that was passed down from our superiors, was that a number of the killed had been han dling weapons ... and there was strong evidence of weapons being found on a body and that weapons had disappeared.\" Private 027 remembers being called in for a briefing with the army lawyers before he went in to give his evidence. \"A couple of days later I was flown in a Sioux helicopter to Coleraine ... I was called into a meeting with a lawyer. The lawyer and I sat either side of the desk and he wrote the statement as I spoke. \"I described shooting from the small wall by Kells Walk towards the centre of the crowd behind the rubble barricade. The lawyer stood up and expressed surprise and said something like: 'We can't have that, can we private? That makes it sound like shots were being fired into the crowd.' I was very surprised.\"",

      "bodyText": "The government last night faced a stinging defeat at the hands of the Lords - its 37th in the parliamentary session - as ministers struggled to rescue as much of their legislative programme as possible before the end of the longest session in recent history. As ministers steeled themselves for an anticipated showdown over the controversial sell-off of the national air traffic control system (Nats), Tory and Lib Dem peers voted by 199 to 136, a majority of 63, to demand tax relief to political parties for donations of up to \u00a3500 during a debate on a separate bill. The government will try to reverse this in the Commons tomorrow if the political parties, elections and referendums bill is to become law as planned by the end of this week. Peers have appeared increasingly assertive in recent weeks, inflicting defeats on issues as diverse as lowering the gay age of consent, the disqualifications bill and the transport bill. As peers limbered up for a fight last night over the part-privatisation of Nats, the constitutional dispute highlighted by their rebellions looked set to widen today when Lady Jay, leader of the Lords and the shadow leader, Lord Strathclyde, clash over the next stage of reforms of the second chamber. The two sides are due to meet to discuss for the third time terms of reference of the proposed joint committee of both houses which will consider the next stage of Lords reforms. Lord Strathclyde is insisting that a reformed second chamber should have a large elected element with full powers to act as a check on the Commons. Lady Jay is insisting that the committee should look only at \"parliamentary aspects\" of a reformed second chamber, and focus on the relative powers of the Commons and Lords, especially the power of the Lords to block legislation.

      "bodyText": "Forensic tests on the battered remains of a lunchbox and lifejacket will show whether a diver has become the fourth victim of a shark attack in less than three months off the coast of Australia. Danny Thorpe, 47, an abalone fisherman, was last seen clinging to his capsized boat a week ago by his fellow diver Howard Rodd, who survived by swimming 15 miles to the shore clinging to the lid of an ice-box, then walked another nine miles through mangroves to find help. Mr Rodd said his friend's fear of sharks kept him clinging to the boat, which overturned in stormy seas off Ceduna, south Australia. His body has not yet been recovered, although wreckage from the boat has been salvaged for forensic examination. \"We expect the experts will be able to tell us exactly what caused the tears to the lifejacket and what took the huge chunk out of the side of the lunchbox,\" a police spokesman said yesterday. Mr Thorpe went missing near where two surfers were killed by shark attacks in late September. Three weeks ago a middle-aged swimmer was killed by a great white shark in waist-deep water off a beach at Perth, in Western Australia.

At a tearful press conference, Mr Rodd spoke of his regret at leaving his friend to swim for help. \"I stayed with him and we sat on the boat for hours and hours, but the trouble was we were blowing offshore.\" He said his friend clung to the boat and refused to put on a wetsuit because of the belief that they encouraged shark attacks by making people resemble seals in the water.

Itchy chops up his head and then puts a stick of dynamite into his skull which explodes. After watching this, Lisa and Bart sit back, laughing uproariously: children aged 8 and 10, whose favourite TV show is one in which a mouse does things to a cat that even Jerry in his most vengeful mood would not contemplate. It's a homage that works by taking Tom and Jerry to its logical conclusion. </p> <p>Shouldn't we worry about this terrible impact of cartoon violence on children? Itchy and Scratchy laughs at the very question. It speaks up for all those children who watched the raw, violent Tom and Jerry but were not corrupted.

Rumours that, with a TV career in mind, he is considering further surgery to uncross his eyes, are unconfirmed. \u0095 An audacious sting ends unluckily in Richmond, Surrey, where a 32-year-old swapped a \u00a355 price tag on pair of jeans in the Dickins and Jones store with one for \u00a332. All went well when he paid the lower price, but his mistake was in then leaving behind both the jeans (for collection later the same day) and his real name and address. Following the resulting appearance before the beak, a fine and costs have boosted the cost of the denims to \u00a3182. diary@theguardian.com",

This estimate would give the company a total price tag of about \u00a335.7m. </p> <p>The company employs 540 staff at 21 stores areound the country, including the Toy Stack chain. </p> <p>In June, the company briefly entered into takeover talks with Charterhouse Development Capital, with discussions understood to be pitched around a sale at the 170p a share. News that these talks had broken down caused Hamleys' shares to plummet. </p> <p>The company has also had to weather four profit warnings in the past two years, though this autumn it announced a slim profit of \u00a39,000 for the 26 weeks to September 23. </p> <p>This was despite largely flat sales during a slow period in the toy market. </p> <p>Sales had also been hit by the fuel crisis, a reduction in tourist numbers this summer and disruptive refurbishment at the flagship Regent Street store, where escalators were out of service for five weeks. </p> <p>The toy company said it had managed to turn around losses of \u00a32.6m incurred in the same period the previous year. This had been done by improving margins and cutting costs. </p> <p>At the time, Mr Burke hinted that the company, which floated in 1994, may not be best suited to the hazards of the stockmarket. </p> <p>\"We have already had to think about what we would do if there was a bid for the company and to consider whether it belongs on the stockmarket,\" he told the Sunday Telegraph. \"Small companies need a good reason to be on the stockmarket. Yes, there's status and kudos, but there has to be more than that. </p> <p>\"If it needs to raise capital, or the proprietors need to dispose of shares or it needs to issue paper for a takeover, then fine. But if there is none of the above there has to be a question mark.\" </p> <p>Yesterday Mr Burke said he was quietly optimistic about achieving reasonable takings during the Christmas period. But he added: \"It will be hard work.\" </p> <p>Mr Ratner of Seymour Pierce said the crucial holiday season was likely to be \"OK, though not wonderful\" across the sector thanks, in part, to Christmas Eve falling on a Sunday. </p> <p>The shares last night closed 12p up at 143.5p.</p>",

Richard Ratner, of broker Seymour Pierce, suggested that news of the sale might have been leaked to provoke interest. \"I think Close Brothers have had this for the last couple of months and in our view it has been leaked to try and find a buyer,\" he said. The likely price per share would be around 170p and not the rumoured \u00a32, he added. This estimate would give the company a total price tag of about \u00a335.7m. The company employs 540 staff at 21 stores areound the country, including the Toy Stack chain. In June, the company briefly entered into takeover talks with Charterhouse Development Capital, with discussions understood to be pitched around a sale at the 170p a share. News that these talks had broken down caused Hamleys' shares to plummet. The company has also had to weather four profit warnings in the past two years, though this autumn it announced a slim profit of \u00a39,000 for the 26 weeks to September 23. This was despite largely flat sales during a slow period in the toy market. Sales had also been hit by the fuel crisis, a reduction in tourist numbers this summer and disruptive refurbishment at the flagship Regent Street store, where escalators were out of service for five weeks. The toy company said it had managed to turn around losses of \u00a32.6m incurred in the same period the previous year. This had been done by improving margins and cutting costs. At the time, Mr Burke hinted that the company, which floated in 1994, may not be best suited to the hazards of the stockmarket. \"We have already had to think about what we would do if there was a bid for the company and to consider whether it belongs on the stockmarket,\" he told the Sunday Telegraph. \"Small companies need a good reason to be on the stockmarket. Yes, there's status and kudos, but there has to be more than that. \"If it needs to raise capital, or the proprietors need to dispose of shares or it needs to issue paper for a takeover, then fine. But if there is none of the above there has to be a question mark.\" Yesterday Mr Burke said he was quietly optimistic about achieving reasonable takings during the Christmas period. But he added: \"It will be hard work.\" Mr Ratner of Seymour Pierce said the crucial holiday season was likely to be \"OK, though not wonderful\" across the sector thanks, in part, to Christmas Eve falling on a Sunday. The shares last night closed 12p up at 143.5p.",

      "body": "<p>The nuclear industry yesterday received a vote of no confidence when AEA Technology, a safety adviser to BNFL and the Ministry of Defence, announced plans to bale out of decommissioning and radioactive waste disposal. </p> <p>AEA, the former commercial arm of UK atomic energy authority will sell off most of its nuclear interests to concentrate on rail and environmental projects in a move which has alarmed green campaigners. </p> <p>The company earned \u00a370m through sales in the first half of this year, but its chairman Sir Anthony Cleaver said: \"Nuclear is a mature market and we do not see opportunities for significant growth as we do elsewhere. It is not a vote of no confidence, it is just a realistic response to what has been happening over the last few years.\" </p> <p>Negotiations with potential buyers have started. The first sales could be completed within six months, but other parts of the business could take up to three years because of regulatory sensitivities. Companies such as BNFL, ABB of Switzerland and Siemens of Germany are thought to be likely bidders. </p> <p>Environmental organisations said the move showed once again the dangerous legacy of the nuclear industry, which had been built up without adequate thought given to the winding down process. </p> <p>Dr Helen Wallace, a Greenpeace scientist who specialises in the nuclear industry, said: \"This leaves a question mark over who is going to be looking after the waste that currently exists and needs constant monitoring.\" </p> <p>Other experts said they were surprised at AEA's decision, when the position of nuclear contractors was improving owing to to increased pressure on governments to clean up faster. </p> <p>AEA has struggled since privatisation four years ago to make its mark as a fully commercial concern partly because of the decrease in volume of the government contracts originally committed to the company. </p> <p>Last month the group issued a profits warning, and yesterday it announced pre-tax profits on ordinary activities of \u00a32.7m, down from \u00a38.9m. Operating profits slumped from \u00a311.8m to \u00a31.4m. Group turnover was constant at \u00a3171.9m compared to \u00a3171.3m, while the dividend remained unchanged at 3.8p.

      "bodyText": "The nuclear industry yesterday received a vote of no confidence when AEA Technology, a safety adviser to BNFL and the Ministry of Defence, announced plans to bale out of decommissioning and radioactive waste disposal. AEA, the former commercial arm of UK atomic energy authority will sell off most of its nuclear interests to concentrate on rail and environmental projects in a move which has alarmed green campaigners. The company earned \u00a370m through sales in the first half of this year, but its chairman Sir Anthony Cleaver said: \"Nuclear is a mature market and we do not see opportunities for significant growth as we do elsewhere. It is not a vote of no confidence, it is just a realistic response to what has been happening over the last few years.\" Negotiations with potential buyers have started. The first sales could be completed within six months, but other parts of the business could take up to three years because of regulatory sensitivities. Companies such as BNFL, ABB of Switzerland and Siemens of Germany are thought to be likely bidders. Environmental organisations said the move showed once again the dangerous legacy of the nuclear industry, which had been built up without adequate thought given to the winding down process. Dr Helen Wallace, a Greenpeace scientist who specialises in the nuclear industry, said: \"This leaves a question mark over who is going to be looking after the waste that currently exists and needs constant monitoring.\" Other experts said they were surprised at AEA's decision, when the position of nuclear contractors was improving owing to to increased pressure on governments to clean up faster. AEA has struggled since privatisation four years ago to make its mark as a fully commercial concern partly because of the decrease in volume of the government contracts originally committed to the company. Last month the group issued a profits warning, and yesterday it announced pre-tax profits on ordinary activities of \u00a32.7m, down from \u00a38.9m. Operating profits slumped from \u00a311.8m to \u00a31.4m. Group turnover was constant at \u00a3171.9m compared to \u00a3171.3m, while the dividend remained unchanged at 3.8p. Shares in AEA, which hit a \u00a310 peak in 1998, last night ended the day down 6.5p to 334.5p, close to where they started in 1996. Analysts said that moving from a slow growth area such as nuclear waste to faster moving areas such as rail made sense. But they added that AEA shares would continue to stagger along at low levels until there were firm signs of the asset sales being completed. The disposal programme will go hand in hand with measures to improve shareholder value, including the possible flotation of its intellectual property business, the search for joint ventures in its engineering software operation and the strengthening of its management team. Costs are also to be cut, through more job losses. Some 50 mainly senior managers left AEA in the first half of the year, costing the company \u00a31.9m in redundancy pay-offs. The engineering software division recorded an operating loss of \u00a31.9m. By contrast rail profits have been booming particularly in Britain.",

Speaking at a conference, Drugs: an international dialogue, Mr Hellawell said that the collusion of financial institutions and countries that allow anonymous bank accounts with the drugs trade was a major obstacle to tackling the spread of narcotics. \"Rather than just seeing dawn raids on dealers and users of drugs, I would like to see dawn raids on a series of banks, travel agents and bureaux de change that front and launder this drug money,\" he told delegates. Mr Hellawell said that the issue of laundering and financial support for the trade had only been \"played with\" and that it needed to be pushed to the top of the political agenda. The collusion, either knowingly or otherwise, of financial institutions in the drug trade was seen as a major obstacle to tackling drug trafficking. Countries that allowed people to open bank accounts identified only by number offered crucial anonymity to the drug trafficker, Mr Hellawell said. Such countries include Costa Rica and Switzerland. \"The first thing to do is to persuade countries and states that have these banking systems to adapt into conventions. \"Of course, if these states are in Europe but don't want to join the EU then it is hard to make sanctions work,\" he said in a veiled reference to Switzerland. Often travel companies are established as fronts for laundering drug money, and exchanging it for other currencies is a way of cleaning cash. In the UK, all regulated deposit-taking organisations - there are 554 - ranging from high street and private banks to solicitors, accountants and insurance companies, are obliged to disclose suspicious transactions to the National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS). There is concern within NCIS, however, that 49% of all suspicious deals are reported by the four high street banks.",

The admission by Mike Grant, chief executive of the Shadow Strategic Rail Authority, astounded MPs on the Commons public accounts committee who were yesterday hearing evidence on action to improve train services. The 94% figure was the rail companies' punctuality target before the Hatfield train crash. Mr Grant - who is also director of passenger rail franchising - told MPs that he would be giving some of the train companies bidding for new franchises their entire new operating period to get their services back to normal. But two operators - Chiltern railways, which has won a 20-year contract to run services out of Marylebone station to Aylesbury, Banbury and Birmingham, and Go-Via, which has a 20-year deal to run services from Victoria to Brighton and the south coast - had been required to reach this target within, respectively, four and 10 years, Mr Grant pointed out. The latter company recently took over from Connex South Central which is losing its contract because services were running so late. Mr Grant explained to an incredulous David Davis, the Tory chairman of the committee: \"The huge investment in infrastructure that is required over the next few years will mean that it will take a considerable time to return services to the original standards of punctuality -which is why we are allowing this to extend to the period of the new contracts.\" Mr Grant did, however, indicate that the new authority was going to sharpen the rules regarding trains that were very late. He said the present rule that allows trains to run up to an hour late before anyone can claim compensation was going to be revised. He also indicated that talks with one inter-city operator, Great Western, which runs services between London and Penzance and Bristol and South Wales, would include asking the firm to pay compensation when trains were running 30 minutes late. One MP, Alan Williams,who represents Swansea West, described the strategic rail authority as \"a joke.\" \"What exactly are you responsible for?\" he asked. Mr Grant replied that the authority was responsible for rail franchises, who owned the railways, and the agenda for the future. He admitted, however, that it was not looking at scrapping the existing privatised system if it did not work. He did concede that if rail directors faced corporate man-slaughter charges, this might change attitudes to running the railways.",

They were killed when the avalanche struck as the party of Venture Scout leaders began a winter survival training course.</p> <p>The group went out at 9am but were hit by an avalanche an hour later.

I did attempt to excavate with my fingers, but this was not even a remote possibility.\"</p> <p>Mr Wild said that the next thing he remembered was hearing voices of rescuers. He began shouting and was quickly dug out.</p> <p>He said he estimated the avalanche had happened at around 10.30am and he was dug out at around 1.30am the following day, leaving him buried for 15 hours.</p> <p>He was taken to Belford hospital in Fort William where he was treated for frost nip to the fingers and possible kidney damage before being discharged on December 31.</p> <p>Asked by procurator fiscal Derek Buchanan if he would do anything differently should a similar situation arise again, he replied: \"No.\"</p> <p>Mr Wild, who qualified as a mountain guide in 1992 and four years later founded his own mountaineering company, said he thought the avalanche could have been triggered by the considerable rise in temperature, from minus 2C at 7.45am to 2C around two hours later.\"</p> <p>The hearing continues.</p>",

The tragedy, on the 1,220 metre (4,000ft) mountain in the Ben Nevis range in December 1998, caused the deaths of Emma Ray, 29, and her boyfriend Paul Hopkins, 28, both from Wilmington, Kent, and Matthew Lewis, 28, and Ian Edwards, 30, both from Dartford, Kent. They were killed when the avalanche struck as the party of Venture Scout leaders began a winter survival training course. The group went out at 9am but were hit by an avalanche an hour later. Mr Wild, of Fort William, and two other climbers, survived after spending 16 hours buried under a wall of snow before being dug out by rescuers. The survivors, Stephen Newton, 24, and his girlfriend Sarah Finch, 25, dug small air holes in the snow, enabling them to breathe. Mr Wild later told the inquiry at Fort William sheriff court that he had visited the area where the avalanche occurred half a dozen times previously, when the risk had been graded category three or four, to carry out similar training, and had not had any problems. On this particular occasion, he assessed the snow conditions on the slope, he said. \"The conclusion I came to was there was no avalanche risk in that immediate area.\" Mr Wild said he started to instruct the group on how to use an ice axe and when it came to the stage where he wanted them to slide down the slope and stop themselves with their ice axes, he climbed a little further up to check the conditions again before trying the technique himself first. He told the hearing he slid about five or 10 metres and when he came to a stop he was aware of a thin layer of snow coming down and covering his boots. Mr Wild said he was then swept away before finding himself buried face down in the snow, unable to move. \"I shouted, but had no response and quickly remembered that sound doesn't travel very quickly through snow. I was not in a position to move. \"The most movement I could make was to scrape with my fingers. I did attempt to excavate with my fingers, but this was not even a remote possibility.\" Mr Wild said that the next thing he remembered was hearing voices of rescuers. He began shouting and was quickly dug out. He said he estimated the avalanche had happened at around 10.30am and he was dug out at around 1.30am the following day, leaving him buried for 15 hours. He was taken to Belford hospital in Fort William where he was treated for frost nip to the fingers and possible kidney damage before being discharged on December 31. Asked by procurator fiscal Derek Buchanan if he would do anything differently should a similar situation arise again, he replied: \"No.\" Mr Wild, who qualified as a mountain guide in 1992 and four years later founded his own mountaineering company, said he thought the avalanche could have been triggered by the considerable rise in temperature, from minus 2C at 7.45am to 2C around two hours later.\" The hearing continues.",

Surrey police confirmed they would not pursue the complaint made against the Simply Red star, who was arrested on Sunday after a woman told police he had sexually attacked her. The singer, 40, who has connections with the Labour party and has been involved in several government think-tanks, had denied the claim. A police spokesman said yesterday: \"Following the recent arrest of a 40-year-old man in connection with allegations of rape, following an investigation by Surrey police, it has been decided that this matter will not be subject to further police investigation.\" Hucknall is the second high profile celebrity in a month to have been questioned by Surrey police in connection with an alleged sex attack. Former Jam singer, Paul Weller, was arrested in October in connection with a rape alleged to have taken place in Farnham, Surrey, four years ago. The star, 42, who was later freed without charge, expressed anger at the publicity given to his arrest and called for more protection to be given to those accused of such crimes. He claimed that his reputation had been tarnished even though there was no substance to the allegation, and branded the legal system, in which only the alleged victim in a rape case is guaranteed anonymity, \"grossly unfair\".

      "bodyText": "Three Germans arrested for the alleged racist killing of a six-year-old boy in 1997 have been released after a key witness made contradictory statements and failed to recognise two suspects in photographs. A Dresden prosecutor, Hans Strobl, said the third suspect had a solid alibi. The 15-year-old witness said the victim's family told him the suspects' names and gave him money, Mr Strobl said. The suspects - two men and a woman aged 20 to 25 - were arrested last week in connection with the death of Joseph Kantelberg-Abdulla, who had an Iraqi father and a German mother. In 1998 the police concluded that his death was an accident, but they are now examining if mistakes were made. Politicians were shocked by published extracts of witness statements collected by the family, who claim that Joseph was tortured, drugged and beaten by 50 neo-Nazis, who then threw him into a pool in Sebnitz, eastern Germany. Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der showed solidarity and met the boy's mother in Berlin. Prosecutors said they had no evidence that the three are involved in east Germany's burgeoning far-right movement. Residents of Sebnitz have cast doubt on the neo-Nazi claim. \"In their despair and grief, the family probably blurred the borders of reality,\" the mayor, Mike Ruckh, said.",

In paintings by Titian, Correggio and Giorgione, and even in lost masterpieces by Leonardo da Vinci and Michel-Angelo, women have sex with a swan, a bull, and a shower of gold. The god Jupiter, who takes on these forms in the stories by Ovid that they illustrated, also snatched the boy Ganymede (in the guise of an eagle, naturally) and Renaissance painters loved to paint that, too. </p> <p>So we should not be surprised by recent headlines in the Italian press hailing \"the topless Gioconda\", a nude pastiche of Leonardo's Mona Lisa that art historians now claim was copied from an original by the Florentine master himself. </p> <p>The painting known as Monna Vanna, painted by Leonardo's pupil Andrea Salai in 1515, has the Mona Lisa's smile, but she's naked, displaying her breasts. American art historian David Brown, curator of Italian Renaissance painting at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, argues that Leonardo painted a lost saucy parody of the Mona Lisa for his patron Giuliano de Medici, and that the Salai is a copy. </p> <p>The erotic possibilities of the Mona Lisa have long been recognised as part of her fascination: just what is she smiling about? Whether or not Salai's Monna Vanna is directly inspired by Leonardo, it is another illustration of the central place of eroticism in early 16th-century painting. It was then that oil paintings started to be regularly commissioned for private pleasure. Leonardo's Leda and the Swan, destroyed possibly because of its indecency but known through copies, and perhaps his lost original for the Monna Vanna, are among the first examples. </p> <p>What was it Renaissance viewers enjoyed about paintings that made them want to hang them at home? Was it the perfection of the perspective, the detail of nature? Perhaps. But maybe it was the sex. </p> <p>When oil paint started to be used in the 15th century, it was an unprecedented technology for portraying flesh: it allowed bodies to be depicted as if they were present and graspable by the viewer. One thing it gave painters was the power to arouse. </p> <p>Giorgione's Sleeping Venus (c1509) is not in the least spiritual: she's naked, asleep. She's painted with lingering sensuality. Correggio's Jupiter and Io (c1532) is outrageous: the naked nymph, with her bottom to us, is being groped by the god in the form of a cloud. Correggio imagines the impossible copulation with perverse detail: the soft, blue-grey cloud wraps itself around Io's hard, white flesh. </p> <p>Eroticism is not incidental to these paintings. It shapes style as well as content. These are some of the first paintings in which paint itself, the sensuous experience of oils, is celebrated: they are paintings that break free from religious and other functions to declare themselves as hedonist visual objects. And the pleasure of paint is explicitly tied to other kinds of pleasure. Nowhere is this more evident than in Titian's mythological paintings, which were so popular that some of them exist in multiple versions made by the artist and his studio in response to demand: about 30 contemporary painted or engraved copies of his Venus and Adonis were made. </p> <p>In 1837 the Duke of Cumberland gave five paintings to the new National Gallery in London but said they were unsuitable for public view. The museum agreed, keeping them away from the eyes of the crowd throughout the 19th century, in the privacy of the director's office. The paintings, including a copy of Michelangelo's lost Leda and the Swan (c1529), were not even acknowledged in the gallery's catalogue until 1929. </p> <p>In the 20th century, however, Renaissance art was often studied precisely as a humanist sanctuary from the obscenity of modern art: paintings of Venus were seen as neoplatonic allegories.

      "body": "<p>Marathon negotiations are enough to try anyone's stamina. When they drag on all night, fatigue is inevitable and tempers fray. Irrespective of gender, the attention span of even the most eager participant is bound to shorten. Sometimes, sheer exhaustion all round produces agreement; sometimes it merely prolongs deadlock and stimulates the blame game.</p> <p>The breakdown of the world climate change conference in the Hague has produced a sexist version of the blame game that should have been binned long ago - but alas, has not. When John Prescott, hardly the most disciplined of politicians, stormed out of the ministerial summit on Sunday morning, the inquest began almost immediately.</p> <p>But it occurred to no one to suggest that it was Prescott's sex, his attributes as the male of the species, that must be held responsible for lack of insight into the compromises required to secure agreement on cuts in greenhouse gases.</p> <p>For his part, Prescott had no problem in identifying the guilty party: it was easier to put the blame for breakdown on a woman's shortcomings than to analyse the real factors, in particular American reluctance to make any real sacrifices with emission targets. Never mind that Dominique Voynet was negotiating on behalf of the European Union, or that she had the backing of the French cabinet.</p> <p>According to our deputy prime minister, the talks broke down because \"she was exhausted and tired\" and was unable to understand the finer points of the compromise that the US, with Britain's backing, was prepared to make. She was a woman and an easy target.</p> <p>Understandably, Voynet believes the conference has introduced her to an extreme example of male chauvinism. In this case, two forceful characters have had a very public clash.</p> <p>But of course this is not a one-off occurrence. Negotiations, almost by definition, are nerve-racking. Opposites have to be reconciled. Men, almost always in the preponderance, prefer the locker-room atmosphere and find women an intrusion when the negotiating becomes tough.</p> <p>Of course there are exceptions, where men are prepared to recognise that women bring an extra element of patience and of insight, perhaps even of flattery and personal appeal, which can produce accord. But when negotiation goes wrong, such attributes count for nothing.</p> <p>There is an old Jewish definition of anti-semitism: \"When you ask who is guilty, name the Jew.\" The same, as often as not, is applied to women negotiators, when no agreement can be reached. Blame the woman, or flatter the woman, but whichever way, assume that women are somehow different in a negotiation and at best are unreliable.</p> <p>In the foreign policy arena, senior women are still few and far between. Margaret Thatcher, of course, was always sui generis. But it is worth remembering that she became known for her \"handbag\" diplomacy - has any man ever become known for his \"briefcase\" diplomacy?</p> <p>And there were some European leaders who were firmly convinced she became a little more pliable if they sent her flowers before a major negotiation.

      "bodyText": "Marathon negotiations are enough to try anyone's stamina. When they drag on all night, fatigue is inevitable and tempers fray. Irrespective of gender, the attention span of even the most eager participant is bound to shorten. Sometimes, sheer exhaustion all round produces agreement; sometimes it merely prolongs deadlock and stimulates the blame game. The breakdown of the world climate change conference in the Hague has produced a sexist version of the blame game that should have been binned long ago - but alas, has not. When John Prescott, hardly the most disciplined of politicians, stormed out of the ministerial summit on Sunday morning, the inquest began almost immediately. But it occurred to no one to suggest that it was Prescott's sex, his attributes as the male of the species, that must be held responsible for lack of insight into the compromises required to secure agreement on cuts in greenhouse gases. For his part, Prescott had no problem in identifying the guilty party: it was easier to put the blame for breakdown on a woman's shortcomings than to analyse the real factors, in particular American reluctance to make any real sacrifices with emission targets. Never mind that Dominique Voynet was negotiating on behalf of the European Union, or that she had the backing of the French cabinet. According to our deputy prime minister, the talks broke down because \"she was exhausted and tired\" and was unable to understand the finer points of the compromise that the US, with Britain's backing, was prepared to make. She was a woman and an easy target. Understandably, Voynet believes the conference has introduced her to an extreme example of male chauvinism. In this case, two forceful characters have had a very public clash. But of course this is not a one-off occurrence. Negotiations, almost by definition, are nerve-racking. Opposites have to be reconciled. Men, almost always in the preponderance, prefer the locker-room atmosphere and find women an intrusion when the negotiating becomes tough. Of course there are exceptions, where men are prepared to recognise that women bring an extra element of patience and of insight, perhaps even of flattery and personal appeal, which can produce accord. But when negotiation goes wrong, such attributes count for nothing. There is an old Jewish definition of anti-semitism: \"When you ask who is guilty, name the Jew.\" The same, as often as not, is applied to women negotiators, when no agreement can be reached. Blame the woman, or flatter the woman, but whichever way, assume that women are somehow different in a negotiation and at best are unreliable. In the foreign policy arena, senior women are still few and far between. Margaret Thatcher, of course, was always sui generis. But it is worth remembering that she became known for her \"handbag\" diplomacy - has any man ever become known for his \"briefcase\" diplomacy? And there were some European leaders who were firmly convinced she became a little more pliable if they sent her flowers before a major negotiation. President Mitterrand went in for red roses. The Italians thought yellow blooms went down even better. Israel's Golda Meir was another woman prime minister who provoked strong feelings in her negotiating partners. Her most famous clash was with Austria's chancellor Bruno Kreisky in 1973, after he had given in to the demands of Arab terrorists and closed down the Schoenau reception camp for Soviet Jews. Meir flew to Vienna on a wave of worldwide protest to castigate Kreisky. He later claimed the meeting was so stormy that she would not even accept a glass of water. The Israelis said this was untrue.

The claim came as the White House prepared to tell a UN conference in New York that the US would only sign the treaty to create the court if it was given guarantees that no American would ever be put on trial before it. As recently as August the Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, opposed the US position, telling Washington that its objections were \"misplaced\" and that the treaty would not expose US military or civilians to vexatious prosecutions, as the White House and Republican congressional leaders believe. Britain denies that it has weakened its approach, but human rights activists claim that it tried to block an effort by the EU to take a firm common stand this week against continuing US demands for exemption. At an intergovernmental EU meeting in Paris on October 31, the British delegate Elizabeth Wilmshurst, who is Mr Cook's deputy legal adviser, opposed parts of a plan for European countries to unite in opposition to Washington's demand for Americans to be exempted. The demand is among the key issues under discussion at the UN preparatory commission meeting on the international court, which began yesterday. Campaigners say that a strong common position by EU members is crucial to resisting US efforts to secure an exemption. \"A weak position by the EU will undermine the efforts of other countries to stand up to the US,\" Richard Dicker, of Human Rights Watch, said. \"Britain is playing a dangerous game which puts the effectiveness and credibility of the court at risk.\" British sources agree that Ms Wilmshurst successfully objected to part of a \"lobbying note\" drafted by France for presentation to the US.

However, the Treasury dismissed suggestions that as much as half of all income tax should be earmarked for an NHS tax. The health secretary, Alan Milburn, is also no longer an anthusiast.</p> <p>Research published at the weekend by the independent taxation commission, established by the leftwing think tank Fabian Society, shows that government anxiety over income tax has forced it to place an excessive emphasis on indirect taxes such as VAT.</p> <p>The inquiry proposes an NHS tax explicitly funded from general tax, building on tax duties earmarked for health and congestion charges for transport. A member of the commission, Julian Le Grand, said an earmarked NHS tax would make both the public and the electorate accountable for the state of the NHS. He added it would allow other public services to be better funded since at present the NHS is taking up more and more of the tax take.</p> <p>The inquiry criticises the Labour government for failing to challenge the prevailing orthodoxy that taxation is in itself illegitimate. It says taxes are never going to be popular, but accuses Labour \"of acting as if proposals to raise taxes cannot win votes\". The inquiry also says that the\"prevailing political orthodoxy\" on tax means the poor are paying proportionately more than the rich in tax.</p> <p>Between 1978 and 1998-99, the richest fifth have seen their share of the nation's post-tax income rise from 36% to 45%. This is partly due to successive cuts in income tax - now only 26% of total tax revenues - and the increasing importance of indirect tax.</p> <p>The bottom fifth of the income distribution pay around 28% of their gross income in indirect taxes, such as VAT or petrol duties, compared to only 12% of the top fifth.</p> <p>The injustice is only removed when the distributional impact of public spending is also taken into account. Around half of the gross income of the bottom 40% of the income distribution comes from the state.</p> <p>Apart from the earmarked NHS tax, the report calls for a 50% top rate of tax applied to taxable incomes of more than \u00a3100,000 a year, a proposal rejected by Tony Blair and the chancellor, Gordon Brown, be fore the last election. The higher rate tax would raise \u00a32.9bn and affect 200,000. The money would finance an increase in the personal allowance by \u00a3250 and an increase in the threshold for the 40% rate to \u00a330,000 taxable income from the present \u00a328,400.</p> <p>The commission also proposes that the rich pay higher council tax, a flat rate personal allowance and realignment of the national insurance upper earnings limit with the higher rate of tax.</p> <p>Polls commisioned by the Inquiry found that 80% would prefer extra public spending to tax cuts. Asked separately whether they would like a 1p increase in unspecified public spending, 40% said yes. Asked if they would like the money devoted to the NHS, 80% said yes and asked if they would like the money go to education, 68% replied positively.</p> <p>Labour strategists have been wary of such poll findings, arguing that they are not borne out in the polling on election day. The strategists point to separate poll findings published by the inquiry suggesting voters believe taxes are too high, and do not support an inheritance tax. But the commission argues that most people suffer a deep sense of disconnection from the taxes they pay and the public services which these finance.</p> <p>The Treasury, and a minority of the Fabian Society inquiry rteam members, oppose earmarked taxes on the grounds that they reduce the flexibility flexibility within the tax system. Opponents also fear that if the NHS tax revenues are registered separately - either through pay slips or by separate taxes linked to specific revenue stream - then other taxes for less popular services will become more difficult to raise.</p> <p>The inquiry suggests the current state of public revenues are good enough not to require short term tax rises. But it points out that public spending as a proportion of GDP - 40.5% - will be lower at the end of the period 2001-4 than when the Conservatives left office in 1996-7.</p> <p>It also points out that the proportion of national income taken in taxes in the UK is 6% lower than the EU average. Only Ireland and Spain have lower overall tax rates.</p> <p>The inquiry, chaired by Lord Plant of Highfield, who was responsible for an earlier influential Labour party report on electoral systems, suggests that confidence in public spending has also been undermined by the way in which the government publishes self-congratulatory annual reports on its own activities.</p> <p>The commission suggests that such reports are worthless in an age when government is not trusted. It concludes: \"The very fact that these annual reports are evaluations of government by government undermine their credibility. They could be paragons of self-criticism, and they would still be regarded as suspect by the media and the public.\"</p> <p>It proposes an independent office for public accountability, expanding the roles of the present national audit office and audit commission. It also suggests a royal commission on taxation to provide impartial evidence on how possible new or reformed taxes would work, and whether they would meet government objectives.</p>",

Between 1978 and 1998-99, the richest fifth have seen their share of the nation's post-tax income rise from 36% to 45%. This is partly due to successive cuts in income tax - now only 26% of total tax revenues - and the increasing importance of indirect tax. The bottom fifth of the income distribution pay around 28% of their gross income in indirect taxes, such as VAT or petrol duties, compared to only 12% of the top fifth. The injustice is only removed when the distributional impact of public spending is also taken into account. Around half of the gross income of the bottom 40% of the income distribution comes from the state. Apart from the earmarked NHS tax, the report calls for a 50% top rate of tax applied to taxable incomes of more than \u00a3100,000 a year, a proposal rejected by Tony Blair and the chancellor, Gordon Brown, be fore the last election. The higher rate tax would raise \u00a32.9bn and affect 200,000. The money would finance an increase in the personal allowance by \u00a3250 and an increase in the threshold for the 40% rate to \u00a330,000 taxable income from the present \u00a328,400. The commission also proposes that the rich pay higher council tax, a flat rate personal allowance and realignment of the national insurance upper earnings limit with the higher rate of tax. Polls commisioned by the Inquiry found that 80% would prefer extra public spending to tax cuts. Asked separately whether they would like a 1p increase in unspecified public spending, 40% said yes. Asked if they would like the money devoted to the NHS, 80% said yes and asked if they would like the money go to education, 68% replied positively. Labour strategists have been wary of such poll findings, arguing that they are not borne out in the polling on election day. The strategists point to separate poll findings published by the inquiry suggesting voters believe taxes are too high, and do not support an inheritance tax. But the commission argues that most people suffer a deep sense of disconnection from the taxes they pay and the public services which these finance. The Treasury, and a minority of the Fabian Society inquiry rteam members, oppose earmarked taxes on the grounds that they reduce the flexibility flexibility within the tax system. Opponents also fear that if the NHS tax revenues are registered separately - either through pay slips or by separate taxes linked to specific revenue stream - then other taxes for less popular services will become more difficult to raise. The inquiry suggests the current state of public revenues are good enough not to require short term tax rises. But it points out that public spending as a proportion of GDP - 40.5% - will be lower at the end of the period 2001-4 than when the Conservatives left office in 1996-7. It also points out that the proportion of national income taken in taxes in the UK is 6% lower than the EU average. Only Ireland and Spain have lower overall tax rates. The inquiry, chaired by Lord Plant of Highfield, who was responsible for an earlier influential Labour party report on electoral systems, suggests that confidence in public spending has also been undermined by the way in which the government publishes self-congratulatory annual reports on its own activities. The commission suggests that such reports are worthless in an age when government is not trusted. It concludes: \"The very fact that these annual reports are evaluations of government by government undermine their credibility. They could be paragons of self-criticism, and they would still be regarded as suspect by the media and the public.\" It proposes an independent office for public accountability, expanding the roles of the present national audit office and audit commission. It also suggests a royal commission on taxation to provide impartial evidence on how possible new or reformed taxes would work, and whether they would meet government objectives.",

      "body": "<p>More than half of Britain's adult population will be using the internet regularly within six months, according to a report released today. </p> <p>The report, Embracing Technology, produced by online bank Egg and research company Mori, says that around 15m people now have internet access at home and forecasts this will increase to 23m by mid-2001. \"We are on the verge of a fundamental shift in attitude to technology and the way that it affects life in the UK,\" said Egg chief executive Mike Harris. </p> <p>\"By mid-2001 more than 23m people in the UK will be online. Nearly one in three say they would vote via the internet in the next general election. </p> <p>\"While currently only 7% of the population depend on technology for buying goods and only 8% for banking, Mori's findings show this is set to change. </p> <p>In the next four to five years about 12m (30%) say they would feel comfortable banking on the net and a similar number can envisage themselves buying a mortgage or insurance online. </p> <p>People's dependence on new technology products is also growing. The report says 14m people believe they cannot live without their mobile phone, 28% feel they are dependent on new technology for keeping in touch with people and gathering information. </p> <p>Within four to five years about 10m people will depend on new technology for shopping and 14m for banking. </p> <p>Some 53% of those surveyed said they were dependent on their PCs. </p> <p>And although 60% of users say they are not dependent on the internet, 55% not dependent on digital TV and 53% are not hooked on email, this could change quickly. </p> <p>Robert Worcester, chairman of Mori said: \"Once we've acquired the mobile or the digital TV, and become comfortable with them, we find that we end up using them for all sorts of extra useful things that we didn't originally anticipate. And over time this greater breadth of use leads to dependency.\" </p> <p>There are restrictions, though. The report says that new technology is central to British life, but there are still 29m adults who do not use a PC and 9m say they never will. Nearly 18m people have a PC or laptop for personal use, but as many as 61% of them use it just for word processing. </p> <p>But, according to Mr Harris, the future is looking good for internet companies. </p> <p>On average, internet users spend nearly four hours a week accessing the internet at home. </p> <p>The report, which surveyed over 2,000 people around the country, will be updated every year to keep track of the changing trends, Mr Harris said.</p>",

The report, Embracing Technology, produced by online bank Egg and research company Mori, says that around 15m people now have internet access at home and forecasts this will increase to 23m by mid-2001. \"We are on the verge of a fundamental shift in attitude to technology and the way that it affects life in the UK,\" said Egg chief executive Mike Harris. \"By mid-2001 more than 23m people in the UK will be online. Nearly one in three say they would vote via the internet in the next general election. \"While currently only 7% of the population depend on technology for buying goods and only 8% for banking, Mori's findings show this is set to change. In the next four to five years about 12m (30%) say they would feel comfortable banking on the net and a similar number can envisage themselves buying a mortgage or insurance online. People's dependence on new technology products is also growing. The report says 14m people believe they cannot live without their mobile phone, 28% feel they are dependent on new technology for keeping in touch with people and gathering information. Within four to five years about 10m people will depend on new technology for shopping and 14m for banking. Some 53% of those surveyed said they were dependent on their PCs. And although 60% of users say they are not dependent on the internet, 55% not dependent on digital TV and 53% are not hooked on email, this could change quickly. Robert Worcester, chairman of Mori said: \"Once we've acquired the mobile or the digital TV, and become comfortable with them, we find that we end up using them for all sorts of extra useful things that we didn't originally anticipate. And over time this greater breadth of use leads to dependency.\" There are restrictions, though. The report says that new technology is central to British life, but there are still 29m adults who do not use a PC and 9m say they never will. Nearly 18m people have a PC or laptop for personal use, but as many as 61% of them use it just for word processing. But, according to Mr Harris, the future is looking good for internet companies. On average, internet users spend nearly four hours a week accessing the internet at home. The report, which surveyed over 2,000 people around the country, will be updated every year to keep track of the changing trends, Mr Harris said.",

      "body": "<p>Until this week most of Augustus Tarosi's customers were Muslims. They drank beer openly at his roadside bar, unfazed by the growing clamour for religious law in Kano city, northern Nigeria. But now the Muslims stay away and it is only a matter of time before the Caris Tavern disappears too.</p> <p>At the weekend Kano became the latest and most volatile Nigerian state to impose full sharia law, including flogging for drinking alcohol and amputation and death for worse offences.</p> <p>Mr Tarosi, a Christian, said his Muslim customers drank openly because no one was offended. \"But we are all scared now and we only say what we think among ourselves.\"</p> <p>\"They tell me to be careful, to go and stay in the army barracks where I will be protected. But this is my business, the source of my living to feed my family, and I must think of what else to do.</p> <p>\"If we stay open it will be very dangerous. Before the law takes its course the hooligans will take advantage to loot our property.\"</p> <p>Kano is the most populous and wealthiest state in northern Nigeria. It also has the biggest Christian population, mostly traders from the south, and a long history of bloody, religious clashes, often provoked by minor disputes. Thousands have died in rioting over such issues as Christians evangelising inside the old Muslim city walls.</p> <p>Almost miraculously, that has not happened with the introduction of sharia. No one has died. But they are mindful of the hundreds killed earlier this year in Kaduna state in violence provoked by the mere proposal to introduce Islamic law.</p> <p>A milder form of sharia, mostly confined to the civil courts for those who wanted it, has long been practised in Kano. The new laws are harsher and compulsory. They bar alcohol, sex outside marriage and women working in many jobs. Public transport and schools will soon be sexually segregated.</p> <p>Old punishments - stoning for adultery and amputation for theft - which were scrapped under British rule, have been reinstated.</p> <p>Theoretically Islamic law will not apply to Christians, but few believe that, and thousands of outsiders have already left the largely non-Muslim Sabon Gari district of the city, which is a regular target for religious fanatics.</p> <p>Businessmen have sent their wives and children to their homes in the south. Some shops are already boarded up and abandoned.</p> <p>The pressure for full sharia came not from Kano's religious or political establishment but from the street. The state governor, Rabiu Kwankwaso, resisted for months, until he was vilified by the very citizens who elected.</p> <p>\"If you are a politician you can't ignore the appeal,\" said one of Kano's leading Islamic scholars, Suliman Kumo. \"The governor of Kano tried his best to sideline the issue . . . but he realised he had no alternative but to make a declaration in favour of sharia.</p> <p>\"For some incomprehensible reason the sharia issue has become so emotional and the one issue that has united people in northern Nigeria. I've never seen a single issue do this in Nigeria. Partly it's rebellion against a non-functioning system.\"</p> <p>There is little doubt that many ordinary Nigerians embrace Islamic law as an act of desperation rather than a religious value system. Islamic intellectuals may talk of sharia as a rulebook for life, but it is sold to many ordinary Muslims as a solution after so many failed alternatives - democracy, military rule and now the reign of President Olusegun Obasanjo.</p> <p>The principal selling point amounts to a holy war on the corruption that is frequently blamed as the source of most of Nigeria's woes.</p> <p>\"There used to be very little corruption as we know it today,\" said the president of the supreme council for sharia, Ibrahim Datti Ahmad.</p> <p>\"This part of the country was peaceful and law abiding. Now, like the southern part of the country, we have violent crimes, armed robbery, arson, hired killings, corruption, especially the misappropriation of public funds in an open and shameless manner. We have a few years of this British common law and centuries of the other, so we are able to compare the two systems and see which is better for us.\"</p> <p>Mr Ahmad predicts that even southern Nigerian states will see the benefits of sharia and embrace it.</p> <p>But Christians warily eye what has happened in those areas where Islamic law has already been introduced.</p> <p>The governor of Zamfara, the first state to adopt sharia, says he draws no distinction between Muslims and Christians. Among sentences passed by the Islamic courts there in recent months are the amputation of a man's leg for stealing a bicycle and an arm for stealing a cow. In August two motorbike-taxi drivers were lashed for carrying female passengers. The most controversial sentence was 180 lashes imposed on a pregnant unmarried girl. She will be publicly flogged 40 days after the baby is delivered.</p> <p>In Kano, city employees in one district have been warned that they will be fined a day's pay every time they miss prayers.</p> <p>The sharia question has divided Nigeria as no other has since the civil war 30 years ago, and provided one of the biggest challenges to President Obasanjo's leadership.</p> <p>Some have called Islamic law a time bomb waiting to tear Nigerian apart. Certainly it has exacerbated the long-simmering tension between the north and south.</p> <p>If there is one thing its supporters and critics agree on, it is that President Obasanjo's handling of the issue has been disastrous.At first he refused to interfere, saying that he believed the movement would simply fizzle out.</p> <p>When the clamour for sharia continued to grow, he won a pledge from northern state governors not to implement it in full. But their promises proved empty. Many were too weak to stop the bandwagon, and those who had the authority to stop it derived that power from supporting sharia.</p> <p>Mr Obasanjo's belated attempts to quell the crisis earned him the further opprobrium of the north, which suddenly made much of his being a born-again Christian.</p> <p>Now he seems powerless to stop a movement he says is a distraction from Nigeria's real problems, though it could well prove bigger than any of them.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Until this week most of Augustus Tarosi's customers were Muslims. They drank beer openly at his roadside bar, unfazed by the growing clamour for religious law in Kano city, northern Nigeria. But now the Muslims stay away and it is only a matter of time before the Caris Tavern disappears too. At the weekend Kano became the latest and most volatile Nigerian state to impose full sharia law, including flogging for drinking alcohol and amputation and death for worse offences. Mr Tarosi, a Christian, said his Muslim customers drank openly because no one was offended. \"But we are all scared now and we only say what we think among ourselves.\" \"They tell me to be careful, to go and stay in the army barracks where I will be protected. But this is my business, the source of my living to feed my family, and I must think of what else to do. \"If we stay open it will be very dangerous. Before the law takes its course the hooligans will take advantage to loot our property.\" Kano is the most populous and wealthiest state in northern Nigeria. It also has the biggest Christian population, mostly traders from the south, and a long history of bloody, religious clashes, often provoked by minor disputes. Thousands have died in rioting over such issues as Christians evangelising inside the old Muslim city walls. Almost miraculously, that has not happened with the introduction of sharia. No one has died. But they are mindful of the hundreds killed earlier this year in Kaduna state in violence provoked by the mere proposal to introduce Islamic law. A milder form of sharia, mostly confined to the civil courts for those who wanted it, has long been practised in Kano. The new laws are harsher and compulsory. They bar alcohol, sex outside marriage and women working in many jobs. Public transport and schools will soon be sexually segregated. Old punishments - stoning for adultery and amputation for theft - which were scrapped under British rule, have been reinstated. Theoretically Islamic law will not apply to Christians, but few believe that, and thousands of outsiders have already left the largely non-Muslim Sabon Gari district of the city, which is a regular target for religious fanatics. Businessmen have sent their wives and children to their homes in the south. Some shops are already boarded up and abandoned. The pressure for full sharia came not from Kano's religious or political establishment but from the street. The state governor, Rabiu Kwankwaso, resisted for months, until he was vilified by the very citizens who elected. \"If you are a politician you can't ignore the appeal,\" said one of Kano's leading Islamic scholars, Suliman Kumo. \"The governor of Kano tried his best to sideline the issue . . . but he realised he had no alternative but to make a declaration in favour of sharia. \"For some incomprehensible reason the sharia issue has become so emotional and the one issue that has united people in northern Nigeria. I've never seen a single issue do this in Nigeria. Partly it's rebellion against a non-functioning system.\" There is little doubt that many ordinary Nigerians embrace Islamic law as an act of desperation rather than a religious value system. Islamic intellectuals may talk of sharia as a rulebook for life, but it is sold to many ordinary Muslims as a solution after so many failed alternatives - democracy, military rule and now the reign of President Olusegun Obasanjo. The principal selling point amounts to a holy war on the corruption that is frequently blamed as the source of most of Nigeria's woes. \"There used to be very little corruption as we know it today,\" said the president of the supreme council for sharia, Ibrahim Datti Ahmad. \"This part of the country was peaceful and law abiding. Now, like the southern part of the country, we have violent crimes, armed robbery, arson, hired killings, corruption, especially the misappropriation of public funds in an open and shameless manner. We have a few years of this British common law and centuries of the other, so we are able to compare the two systems and see which is better for us.\" Mr Ahmad predicts that even southern Nigerian states will see the benefits of sharia and embrace it. But Christians warily eye what has happened in those areas where Islamic law has already been introduced. The governor of Zamfara, the first state to adopt sharia, says he draws no distinction between Muslims and Christians. Among sentences passed by the Islamic courts there in recent months are the amputation of a man's leg for stealing a bicycle and an arm for stealing a cow. In August two motorbike-taxi drivers were lashed for carrying female passengers. The most controversial sentence was 180 lashes imposed on a pregnant unmarried girl. She will be publicly flogged 40 days after the baby is delivered. In Kano, city employees in one district have been warned that they will be fined a day's pay every time they miss prayers. The sharia question has divided Nigeria as no other has since the civil war 30 years ago, and provided one of the biggest challenges to President Obasanjo's leadership. Some have called Islamic law a time bomb waiting to tear Nigerian apart. Certainly it has exacerbated the long-simmering tension between the north and south. If there is one thing its supporters and critics agree on, it is that President Obasanjo's handling of the issue has been disastrous.At first he refused to interfere, saying that he believed the movement would simply fizzle out. When the clamour for sharia continued to grow, he won a pledge from northern state governors not to implement it in full. But their promises proved empty. Many were too weak to stop the bandwagon, and those who had the authority to stop it derived that power from supporting sharia. Mr Obasanjo's belated attempts to quell the crisis earned him the further opprobrium of the north, which suddenly made much of his being a born-again Christian. Now he seems powerless to stop a movement he says is a distraction from Nigeria's real problems, though it could well prove bigger than any of them.",

Most of them died in a stampede prompted by a fire in the Chowdhury Knitwear Garments factory, in Shibpur, south-east of Dhaka. Nearly 100 people are being treated in hospital and more deaths are expected. The Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association's failure to protect the 1.2m workers, mostly women, who form the backbone of the industry, is causing growing anger. About 300 have died since 1990, mainly in fires. People are asking how many more must die before something is done. The repetition of the statements customarily issued in the wake of such accidents has intensified the public shock and anger at the government and factory bosses. The prime minister, Sheikh Hasina, expressed her shock and sympathy at the incident and ordered an investigation. She also promised that those to blame for the deaths would be punished. The leaders of the association once again vowed to improve safety measures in the factories. But independent observers believe that nothing will be done. They predict that factory staff, though fearful, will once again go back to work, the inquiry report will never see the light of the day, and people will forget the tragedy, as they have forgotten others. \"You must understand that the victims are not only poor, but they're women. And who cares for them?\" said Khushi Kabir, an activist for women's rights. Most Bangladeshi garment factories are housed in rented buildings not designed for such use. Few factories have an alarm system and the fire extinguishers rarely work. Staircases are invariably narrow, gates remain locked during working hours, and most factories lack emergency exits. As a result, in an emergency - especially a fire - the workers often find themselves trapped, leading them to join potentially fatal stampedes or jump from the windows. On Saturday, when fire broke out in the Chowdhury factory, most of the victims died in a stampede which began when firefighters cut open the locked gates. If the gates could have been opened quickly then lives would have been saved, a fire brigade official said. The factory management reportedly locked the gates in an effort to prevent its workers disrupting production by going outside for fresh air. The factory owner, Sagar Chowdhury, said the fire was caused by a short circuit.",

      "body": "<p>It's a mystery, one City analyst observed last week as the latest trade figures were published. While manufacturers complain loudly that sterling's overvaluation against the euro is pricing them out of European markets, the data tells a different story. </p> <p>In fact it tells two stories, one about Britain's trade with the European Union - where the trade deficit has almost closed - and another about trade with the rest of the world, which is collapsing, sending the deficit to record levels. </p> <p>The most recent figures from the office for national statistics show that exports to the European Union are increasing at a healthy rate and Britain's trade deficit with the EU is almost in balance. The deficit with the EU over the three months to October stood at \u00a3178m, the smallest shortfall since the second quarter of 1991. Britain posted a trade surplus with the 11 members of the eurozone in October, for the second month in a row. </p> <p>The picture for trade with the rest of the world is much grimmer. Over the past three months, imports have grown three times as fast as exports and the non-EU trade deficit has widened to a record \u00a37.5bn. The trade figures can be erratic - a large import such as the cruise ship Aurora distorts the trade figures for several months because it will appear in the monthly trade figures with the EU and aggregated world figures, and again in the quarterly figures. </p> <p>The picture emerging, however, is consistent - but puzzling. Sterling has been trading at more than \u20ac1.55 - the equivalent of more than DM3 - for a nearly a year. That surely must be making it hard to sell British goods in Europe. On the other side of the picture, since February sterling has fallen sharply against the dollar. That ought to be making British goods more attractive in these markets. </p> <p>So why does the opposite appear to be happening? City analysts offer several explanations. First, changes in the currency are more important than its absolute level. Sterling made most of its gains against European currencies in late 1996 and in the first half of 1997, a climb which took it from DM2.20 to DM3 within the space of eight months. It started climbing again at the start of 1999 and peaked at DM3.40, but the ascent was less rapid. This year, it has swung around in a range of DM3.10-3.40. </p> <p>The period of gravity-defying ascent is when many manufacturers give up and decide that exporting in the face of such uncertainty is a mug's game. Once the currency stabilises, firms that have survived have an incentive to stick it out. </p> <p>Kate Barker, chief economic adviser to the Confederation of British Industry, says that in today's more competitive environment firms hang on to markets at all costs. \"People used to be more willing to give up markets. Now they are reluctant to unless they absolutely have to,\" she says. Often that means slashing profit margins on exports to Europe to paper thin levels, hoping that other markets or home sales can keep the business afloat. </p> <p>But the high exchange rate is changing the face of British manufacturing.

      "bodyText": "It's a mystery, one City analyst observed last week as the latest trade figures were published. While manufacturers complain loudly that sterling's overvaluation against the euro is pricing them out of European markets, the data tells a different story. In fact it tells two stories, one about Britain's trade with the European Union - where the trade deficit has almost closed - and another about trade with the rest of the world, which is collapsing, sending the deficit to record levels. The most recent figures from the office for national statistics show that exports to the European Union are increasing at a healthy rate and Britain's trade deficit with the EU is almost in balance. The deficit with the EU over the three months to October stood at \u00a3178m, the smallest shortfall since the second quarter of 1991. Britain posted a trade surplus with the 11 members of the eurozone in October, for the second month in a row. The picture for trade with the rest of the world is much grimmer. Over the past three months, imports have grown three times as fast as exports and the non-EU trade deficit has widened to a record \u00a37.5bn. The trade figures can be erratic - a large import such as the cruise ship Aurora distorts the trade figures for several months because it will appear in the monthly trade figures with the EU and aggregated world figures, and again in the quarterly figures. The picture emerging, however, is consistent - but puzzling. Sterling has been trading at more than \u20ac1.55 - the equivalent of more than DM3 - for a nearly a year. That surely must be making it hard to sell British goods in Europe. On the other side of the picture, since February sterling has fallen sharply against the dollar. That ought to be making British goods more attractive in these markets. So why does the opposite appear to be happening? City analysts offer several explanations. First, changes in the currency are more important than its absolute level. Sterling made most of its gains against European currencies in late 1996 and in the first half of 1997, a climb which took it from DM2.20 to DM3 within the space of eight months. It started climbing again at the start of 1999 and peaked at DM3.40, but the ascent was less rapid. This year, it has swung around in a range of DM3.10-3.40. The period of gravity-defying ascent is when many manufacturers give up and decide that exporting in the face of such uncertainty is a mug's game. Once the currency stabilises, firms that have survived have an incentive to stick it out. Kate Barker, chief economic adviser to the Confederation of British Industry, says that in today's more competitive environment firms hang on to markets at all costs. \"People used to be more willing to give up markets. Now they are reluctant to unless they absolutely have to,\" she says. Often that means slashing profit margins on exports to Europe to paper thin levels, hoping that other markets or home sales can keep the business afloat. But the high exchange rate is changing the face of British manufacturing. Low valued-added areas such as metal bashing and basic chemicals are shrinking, as firms go out of business or shift to more profitable lines, while hi-tech sectors such as pharmaceuticals and IT are growing rapidly. High value-added firms have less problem surviving the high exchange rate be cause they compete less on price. \"The new economy bits of manufacturing are doing well,\" says Robert Barrie, UK economist with Credit Suisse First Boston. \"Whereas the car industry and other areas where there is structural change going on are doing less well.\" Mr Barrie says trade patterns are usually dictated by the speed at which different economies are growing rather than movements in exchange rates. Economic growth in 11 members of the eurozone has outstripped UK growth in every quarter since the start of 1999, and as result the continent is sucking in imports from Britain, narrowing the deficit with Europe. Growth in many other parts of the world economy is slowing however, bring about a collapse in demand for British goods. Britain's problems with trade outside the EU began during the Asian crisis in late 1997, according to Geoffrey Dicks, UK economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland.

When they had recovered sufficiently from the damage wrought by crisis and were able to start exporting again, their goods were extremely cheap. \"A big hole opened up [in non-EU trade] at the time of the Asian crisis,\" says Mr Dicks. \"We are still seeing an enormous volume of imports from these countries. They are swamping the world.\" At the same time, after making a rapid recovery initially following the crisis, these countries' economies are starting to slow down, making it harder for British firms to sell goods in their markets. The real worry is what happens next. Partly as a result of the record expansion of the US economy, world growth this year has been its strongest for more than 10 years.

European growth is already easing, which may make it harder for British firms to keep a foothold on the continent. \"But the fun starts if the US economy really does slow down,\" says Mr Dicks. \"Can the world live without the US acting as the consumer of first resort?\"",

I dressed up.' </p> <p>\"Did you go on the bus?\" </p> <p>That was the point at which the party-goer's eyes twinkled. He decided he would take the risk and take the trouble and tell all. He would share his pantomime. </p> <p>He was Oberon, King of the Fairies. His tights were grey. His jacket was a precise amount too small, beaded and flamboyant. \"Feminine,\" he said. </p> <p>His face was painted gold. He wore his crown with a kingly tilt. </p> <p>Titania was hard by, and they set off together in state in the back of a taxi. Now Oberon and Titania speak Spanish at home as Titania is not so comfortable in English. This meant that when the taxi got lost, as Oberon told me, \"very near\" - a few streets away \"from the party\", it was Oberon who ventured into the corner shop to ask the way. \"You know how it is in the city,\" Oberon went on, \"nobody knows anything.\" And he left the corner shop in some irritation, with no more information than when he had entered it. Oberon headed straight for Titiania and the taxi preparing to express his frustration. </p> <p>However, Oberon's eyes are not good and in the darkness they are less than not good. Yet even he could see the widening eyes of the horrified couple among which he had sat himself to exclaim at the corner shop's unhelpfulness. And when he heard muffled shouts from Titania somewhere outside in the distance - he realised he had got into the wrong car. </p> <p>Oberon made his apologies and left. </p> <p>Perhaps elsewhere in our city on this Monday morning somebody else is telling the story of their weekend: \"Would you believe it? Just outside the corner shop ... a mad man ... dressed as a fairy ... flung himself ... into our car!' </p> <p>Oberon was asked to tell the story twice when he and Titania finally arrived at the party. He was asked to tell it again in our staffroom, too. It is with his permission that I tell it here. We found one person who was not sure that it was funny. It was sad. The decadence of dressing up and fancy dress and fairies was overwhelming. More Oblomov than Oberon. </p> <p>Certainly further education is not the natural habitat of dressing up and fancy dress and fairies - but that was all part of the incongruity that lit up our Monday morning.</p>",

Did you?\" \"Yes ... in fact I went to a party on Saturday - a fancy dress party. I dressed up.' \"Did you go on the bus?\" That was the point at which the party-goer's eyes twinkled. He decided he would take the risk and take the trouble and tell all. He would share his pantomime. He was Oberon, King of the Fairies. His tights were grey. His jacket was a precise amount too small, beaded and flamboyant. \"Feminine,\" he said. His face was painted gold. He wore his crown with a kingly tilt. Titania was hard by, and they set off together in state in the back of a taxi. Now Oberon and Titania speak Spanish at home as Titania is not so comfortable in English. This meant that when the taxi got lost, as Oberon told me, \"very near\" - a few streets away \"from the party\", it was Oberon who ventured into the corner shop to ask the way. \"You know how it is in the city,\" Oberon went on, \"nobody knows anything.\" And he left the corner shop in some irritation, with no more information than when he had entered it. Oberon headed straight for Titiania and the taxi preparing to express his frustration. However, Oberon's eyes are not good and in the darkness they are less than not good. Yet even he could see the widening eyes of the horrified couple among which he had sat himself to exclaim at the corner shop's unhelpfulness. And when he heard muffled shouts from Titania somewhere outside in the distance - he realised he had got into the wrong car. Oberon made his apologies and left. Perhaps elsewhere in our city on this Monday morning somebody else is telling the story of their weekend: \"Would you believe it? Just outside the corner shop ... a mad man ... dressed as a fairy ... flung himself ... into our car!' Oberon was asked to tell the story twice when he and Titania finally arrived at the party. He was asked to tell it again in our staffroom, too. It is with his permission that I tell it here. We found one person who was not sure that it was funny. It was sad. The decadence of dressing up and fancy dress and fairies was overwhelming. More Oblomov than Oberon. Certainly further education is not the natural habitat of dressing up and fancy dress and fairies - but that was all part of the incongruity that lit up our Monday morning.",

This year, starting on November 29, Bedford College is running a series of four three-hour evening classes to help with the Christmas catering.

Government is proposing that colleges should lose powers to select and brief accountants in the wake of the recent debacle at Halton college, which overclaimed \u00a314m. </p> <p>College managements have reacted angrily to what they see as a radical attack on their autonomy.

      "bodyText": "Colleges are consulting lawyers over plans to strip them of the right to appoint their own auditors. Government is proposing that colleges should lose powers to select and brief accountants in the wake of the recent debacle at Halton college, which overclaimed \u00a314m. College managements have reacted angrily to what they see as a radical attack on their autonomy. They had until yesterday to respond to proposals that the Further Education Funding Council and its successor the Learning and Skills Council will in future appoint the auditors. Weak auditing procedures were highlighted in a scorching report by the Commons Public Accounts Committee on Halton college last year \"... the failings at Halton arose through a combination of a strong-willed principal, a weak audit process and a governing body that was not on top of the situation ...\" the committee concluded. Baroness Blackstone, the further education minister, announced in April that auditing procedures in colleges would be tightened up. The funding council sent colleges a circular in October stating that it \"was required to take over responsibility\" for the external audit of the individualised student records (ISRs) which institutions submit three times a year. The circular outlined two options: that the funding council, and by ex tension its successor, the Learning and Skills Council, appoint auditors for the ISRs, or that they appoint auditors to scrutinise ISRs and colleges' end-of-year funding claims. These claims, filed in the autumn following each college year, cover about a third of the cash they receive from government. If colleges are found to have been over optimistic in their applications for funds and not recruited the student numbers they predicted, they have to repay the overclaim. A spokesman for the funding council said that the consultation was about how the government's instructions were to be carried out, not whether they would be. That, so far as he understood, was not up for debate. Following advice on the situation from a leading accountancy firm, colleges are seeking an opinion from lawyers on the issue and the conduct of the consultation exercise. According to the Association of Colleges, the FEFC and LSC are not following government orders on the transfer of audit powers over the final funding claims but acting off their own bats. David Gibson, the association's chief executive, said: \"Whilst appreciating that it's only a consultation exercise at this moment there hasn't been time for colleges to consult their governors before responding, and a large number of colleges have expressed the gravest of concerns.\" Joanna Tait, principal of Bishop Auckland college, said: \"I think there is a conflict of interest if the body providing the funds becomes involved in checking the spending of the money.\" The proposals attack the heart of a college corporation's autonomy and independence - reaffirmed in the Learning and Skills Act, linked to the principle that its governors are to be held accountable for negligent error. \"If they are to be held accountable then they must also be entrusted with the responsibility which goes with it,\" she said.

      "body": "<p>The University of Oxford is one of Britain's great institutions. It commands affection and respect across the world. Yet today there is also a sense of malaise, both inside and outside the university: a belief that Oxford finds it difficult to adapt to changing educational and social needs, a fear that it can no longer maintain its pre-eminence. There is real cause for this disquiet, but the university seems unable even to address the question. </p> <p>It is not easy to describe Oxford's governance structure. This difficulty is not just my own. Management consultants Coopers &amp; Lybrand, reporting on Oxford's governance in 1996, noted that \"in one of our meetings, the expression of bewilderment by one person was explained by others as being due to the fact that he had been in Oxford for only seven years.\" </p> <p>The university has no structures of authority, responsibility and accountability, and many of its officers and members have no concept of such structures. The system is a morass of committees with ill-defined and often overlapping jurisdictions. </p> <p>The consequence of this miasma is not only the waste of time and paper. It is the absence of any means of resolving contentious issues in a consistent way. Or often at all. As Coopers &amp; Lybrand observed, \"in many cases, university decisions are not specifically made at all, they just emerge\". </p> <p> The source of ultimate authority at the university is Congregation: the \"parliament\" of all the Oxford faculty, some 3,000 in number. The impracticality of Congregation as a forum for decision-making is so clear that I came to learn that the words \"this might have to go to a Congregation\" became a powerful argument against a proposal. </p> <p>Quality control requires clarity and firmness. The lack of either is potentially disastrous for an institution with aspirations to high standards. For example, I was involved in an assessment of a probationary Oxford lecturer. The case was clear. The individual had poor teaching evaluations and a thin research record: an external assessor from a redbrick university affirmed that the person concerned would not qualify for tenure at his own institution. Both Oxford and the individual concerned would have been better off if the lecturer had been transferred to a less exalted university. This could easily have been arranged. </p> <p>But Oxford is full of kind and well-meaning people, so non-renewal would not have been contentious. I learned that a decision not to renew the contract, even if agreed by all the senior academic staff at the business school, would have to go first before a committee of 16 people (several more junior than the individual concerned) and then on to a still larger committee. That committee would contain nobody with any knowledge of the subject or of a business education, but might well overturn the original recommendation: it would certainly scrutinise procedure in minute detail and seek common ground between conflicting positions. It was apparent that non-renewal was simply impractical. </p> <p>Thus the university proceeds by a mixture of general inertia and random initiatives. The business school was the largest of recent initiatives. When I became director in 1996, it was clear to me that the first priorities were to establish a development strategy; to identify the early steps needed to implement that strategy, and to put forward proposals for the operational management of the school to the university. The preparation of a strategy went well. I held enthusiastic meetings with colleagues. We spent a day with all our management faculty formulating a strategy document. The paper runs to 50 pages, defines the immense potential of a business school in Oxford, and I remain proud of it. My hope was that we could discuss this strategy with the university and then begin the implementation of an agreed plan. </p> <p>At this point, the process ran into the ground. The university had no mechanism for proceeding with such discussions. I was advised that I had to turn the document into specific proposals which would then be considered by diverse relevant committees. But a plan to establish a new institution rests on interlinked initiatives. You cannot discuss courses, staffing and building independently of each other, even if there were different committees for all these things. </p> <p>We encountered the same incapacity to reach a conclusion in relation to salaries and recruitment. It is not possible to attract an internationally distinguished business school faculty if a newly appointed lecturer is paid less than \u00a320,000 and the standard professional salary is around \u00a340,000. (Would you listen to a lecture on corporate finance or option pricing from someone earning less than a receptionist at an investment bank?) But Oxford, like other universities, cannot afford to pay all its staff at the rate necessary to attract capable business-school teachers. Although I spent many, many hours at meetings discussing salaries, this fundamental issue was never discussed. Most time was devoted to the search for ambiguity - could we establish a formula which actually paid people more while appearing not to do so? In the end, this approach offered no real answer: when it comes down to it, people are either paid more or they are not. </p> <p>It is difficult - or impossible - for people outside Oxford, used to normal management processes, to deal with those who hold executive titles but who do not have executive functions. Outsiders expect to negotiate agreements with responsible officers on the basis that the results of such negotiation will be honoured. But this expectation cannot be satisfied because the individuals who conduct the negotiations lack appropriate authority. This situation was a source of incomprehension and eventually of frustration to Wafic Said, who spent five years trying to persuade the university to accept his \u00a320m gift. </p> <p>With my colleagues, I sought to establish a governance structure that would enable the business school, at least, to make decisions. We put forward proposals under which an executive committee of the school would have reported on operational matters to a board made up of senior members of the university plus experienced outside business people, and on academic matters to a university committee. This corresponds, more or less, to the way leading academic institutions around the world are run. </p> <p>I was not successful even in securing serious discussion of these suggestions. The clarity of responsibility I sought was not the Oxford way, and by diluting the role of university committees it was feared that the business school would undermine Oxford's ostensible democracy. At this point I finally understood that creating an institution within Oxford which could compete with major international business schools was impossible. </p> <p>How can an institution that is so badly run have been successful for so long? The answer runs, I believe, as follows. The art of managing a successful academic community involves balancing the need for pluralism and individual intellectual freedom with a shared commitment to the values and success of the institution. The decentralised collegiate structure of' Oxford, combined with its inchoate committee processes, sustained that balance for many years. But this achievement depended on a high degree of social homogeneity among the members of the university, a relatively slow-moving environment and little external pressure. Faced with internal heterogeneity, much greater outside pressure and a rapid pace of change, this structure has ceased to work. </p> <p>For activities which are well established and reasonably successful - and this is true of most of what Oxford does - the paralysis of decision-making and an absence of capacity to devise policy or strategy result in slow decline, but not immediate disaster. Oxford is not collapsing, simply sliding gradually into mediocrity. We can argue about the significance of published league tables, but there is no doubt that Oxford is losing its pre-eminence among British academic institutions, and that these in turn are falling increasingly behind the top US schools. While the power of the Oxford brand is still extraordinary, and the quality of the best students, teaching and research remains outstanding, an increasing amount of activity is mediocre and amateur. </p> <p>There is a widespread perception within Oxford itself that the governance structure is in need of reform: there has even been a recent committee of inquiry, led by a former vice-chancellor, although its results were of little consequence. But the capacity to generate reform internally is limited by a lack of understanding of the nature of the problems. </p> <p>These problems were well identified by the Coopers &amp; Lybrand report (prepared as part of the background to the committee of inquiry). But Coopers' comments - although made with obvious respect for the institution - were brushed aside. There are those who think that any criticism of Oxford's procedures - even from its own consultants or members - must be the product of misunderstanding or malice. </p> <p>As Coopers &amp; Lybrand emphasised, the search for participatory democracy is doomed. It is not only that an organisation of the size and complexity of Oxford cannot be run by an assembly of 3,000 people, important though that point is. It is also that, even if they could do it, they should not. Any reader of John Bayley's admirable Iris and the Friends will recognise that the characters described are people who should be left free to develop the products of their extraordinary talents, while others, with fewer gifts but more relevant experience worry about the level of student fees, the design of the reception area in the business school, and the salary paid to a computing assistant. </p> <p> The inability to understand that democracy does not preclude delegation and expertise is general. The construction of a business school is a \u00a330m task and it was obvious to me that we needed a project manager who could answer the questions raised by the architects and engineers - questions, for example, about the ventilation system or the materials to be used. I was refused permission to hire such a person. I was told that in Oxford the way to deal with such issues was to appoint - of course - a committee of academics. Hiring someone would also cost money, while the time of academics, who should have been doing teaching and research, was assumed to be free. </p> <p>This problem went deep. All the support functions of the university -from accounting to fundraising to marketing - are underpaid and under-resourced. Professional skills are not valued, nor the individuals who have them. </p> <p>As a result, the university fails to take advantage of the talents and often extraordinary commitment of its non-academic staff, who in turn feel demoralised and fearful of any show of initiative. The notion that effective management and free intellectual inquiry are incompatible derives from the belief that if you give people authority to fix Iris Murdoch's bookshelves they will start telling her what to write. This fear should not be discounted completely - there are people like that - but there are also ample means of safeguarding against them. The ideal of a community of scholars is well worth preserving, but we should be clearer about what it does and what it does not mean. </p> <p>The most vibrant academic institutions - like Harvard and Stanford today, or Oxford in its glory days - are those which give scholars the financial and practical freedom to pursue the goals of scholarship. In a modern world, this is achievable, as at Harvard and Stanford, only through effective professional management of the institution. </p> <p> John Kay resigned as director of the Said Business School during its construction. </p> <p>\u0095 Next week: Anthony Hopwood, John Kay's successor, replies</p> <p><strong>The background</strong><br></p> <p> A \u00a320m donation from Wafic Said, the Saudi businessman, was welcomed as the most generous donation to Oxford in half a century but it took the university five years to accept the concept of his business school. </p> <p>Then in 1996 followed a bitter row over the plan to site the school on a sports field in the centre of the city amidst the historic colleges. This ended in an embarrassing defeat for Said by Congregation, the university \"parliament\".

There, said it. </p> <p>My rough calculations suggest vice-chancellors' salaries at our top institutions ought to be doubled, and those at middle-ranking universities raised by about 20-30%. This would improve the flow of talented candidates willing to do what has become a tough and unattractive job. </p> <p>Before the letters come rolling in from Dr Aggrieved of Dreamworld, let's look at the evidence. First, we know the average chief executive of a reasonably sized British company earns about \u00a3700,000 a year. The job of a vice-chancellor is fairly close in kind to this. It would not make sense to pay as much as in the private commercial sector. </p> <p>Such bosses often run larger organisations, have more job uncertainty than is true of vice-chancellors, and usually have to have more managerial talent (no offence to anyone) than is necessary for university heads. Yet this broad comparison makes it clear that Britain's universities are wildly out of line with what has become a normal executive-level wage packet. </p> <p>\"Ahh,\" comes the muffled shriek from the prostrate gentleman at the back of the common room, \"but these British executives are greatly over-paid, so Victor Vain, our vice-chancellor, does not deserve any more largesse.\" Well, feel free to complain about the price of apples, too. But if you want tasty ones, they cost. And the same goes for professors. </p> <p>Second, US college presidents get more than \u00a3300,000 a year in the top universities. The US market makes a natural and efficient (not to say probably prescient) standard of comparison. It is a fairly free market, so we can use it to estimate what practical sense might look like here. The US is nearly 50% richer, as a nation, than we are. We have to adjust down for that. Hence, if its top university people make around \u00a3300,000, the right price for ours would be about \u00a3200,000. </p> <p>Third, there is a shortage of qualified vice-chancellors in Britain. Nobody is sure why this has happened, but an economist might conclude that the job has got worse. When life gets nastier, pay gets tastier. </p> <p>Fourth, sharp evidence from all over the western world suggests wage inequality is rising through time. Our universities cannot close their eyes and say they refuse to adapt. If they try, market pressures will punish them. </p> <p>The question as to why wage dispersion is rising is debated in the seminars in which I spend my life. A good bet is that, in the case of managers, the outside world has become more important. We live in a global marketplace, and all that. This means you need a good vice-chancellor even more now because one mistake could see your university shut down in 2025 because of competition from an e-university in Texas, or the like. </p> <p>Fifth, the system for paying vice-chancellors has led to an inefficiently flat wage structure across different types of university. The bosses of our largest universities are paid no more, and occasionally less, than those of our smaller universities. This is daft. </p> <p>There are arguments on the other side. Fairness is a word that may be on your lips. But analysing it is hard. On one hand, it's right that human beings prosper if they are in a world where inequities are not too great. It's palpably unjust that those born with lucky gifts should reap more riches than those born with handicaps. But on the other, the green-eyed monster is best resisted.

      "body": "<p>No sooner have I survived my first meeting of the governing body than another sheaf of photocopied paperwork from the school office lands on my doormat. Since I had put up my hand for the curriculum development committee, this bundle contains a copy of the school development plan (SDP): a thick document of aims, targets and assessments for every subject. </p> <p>I put this at least to one side, because an accompanying notice advises me that the curriculum development meeting is not for another fortnight. More urgent is the invitation to a workshop for governors on performance management training (yes, yes: PMT). </p> <p>Since the school seems generally to make the assumption that most parents and certainly anyone prepared to be a governor cannot possibly have a life (or even paid employment that might exert some prior claim), two days is the standard notice period for most events. So it is with the PMT workshop: with a sigh, 5pm the day after the morrow goes in my diary. </p> <p>When I arrive, dripping wet and in a mood nearly as foul as the weather, it proves, as ever, impossible to get a reply on the entryphone. Fortunately, school security is compromised by a passing cleaner and I make my way up to the staff room. A handful of fellow parent and partnership governors have made it already; I am greeted by a tall, floppy-haired man with pale eyes and a short reddish beard. He looks strikingly like Boris Becker, except that when he speaks it is in a modified northern accent. He bids me hello and introduces himself as \"Jeff\", invites me to sit in the semi-circle of chairs he has arranged around an overhead projector. </p> <p>\"Hello, my name is Jeff Mayhew, and I am an instructor with Rebus, a human resources services company in education. My job today is to take you through the concept of performance management and how it is intended to work in the context of your school.\" </p> <p>He has this spiel down pat. I find myself switching off and wondering instead how someone like him ends up doing presentations for an outfit like Rebus. The possible biographical narratives seem a lot more interesting than the bullet-point paragraphs he has just illuminated on the projector. </p> <p>Perhaps this is a day-job for an aspiring actor. I like this: Jeff dreams of playing Hamlet, but today he is soliloquising about new initiatives in pay structures. </p> <p>\"So do you all know what threshold payments are?\" Jeff breaks the spell of my daydream by going into the interrogative. </p> <p>\"Well, you may have read earlier this year that David Blunkett decreed that teachers who had served a certain number of years were to receive a threshold payment, a lump sum of \u00a32,000. The teachers' unions succeeded in holding up its introduction in the courts, so the DfEE had to delay implementation. But it is now about to come in. By the beginning of next year, you - the school governors - will be required to have held a performance review of your head-teacher and set his or her salary accordingly,\" explains Jeff, scrupulously skirting around the political issues. </p> <p>It all sounds complicated and contentious: clearly, performance management is intended to shoe-horn into this vast public service leviathan a private-sector ethos of competitiveness and reward, introducing pay differentials and abolishing automatic length-of-service salary increments. But, as Jeff explains confidingly, much of what performance management replaces is similar to the existing system of teacher appraisal. The difference is that automatic pay increments for length of service have been abolished, which has upset the teachers' unions. But the good news is that the ceiling on teachers' earnings has also been removed, so that senior teachers can go on working the classroom without having, as in the past, to move into management in order to boost their salary. Fortunately for we governors, though, we have only to decide the salary of the head-teacher. Mr Richardson is answerable for the potentially divisive task of assessing the rest of the teaching staff. </p> <p>Jeff has established a rapport with his audience. At the end, I swear, if there were about three more people in the room, he would have got a round of applause. Perhaps Jeff shouldn't stick to the day-job.</p>",

      "bodyText": "No sooner have I survived my first meeting of the governing body than another sheaf of photocopied paperwork from the school office lands on my doormat. Since I had put up my hand for the curriculum development committee, this bundle contains a copy of the school development plan (SDP): a thick document of aims, targets and assessments for every subject. I put this at least to one side, because an accompanying notice advises me that the curriculum development meeting is not for another fortnight. More urgent is the invitation to a workshop for governors on performance management training (yes, yes: PMT). Since the school seems generally to make the assumption that most parents and certainly anyone prepared to be a governor cannot possibly have a life (or even paid employment that might exert some prior claim), two days is the standard notice period for most events. So it is with the PMT workshop: with a sigh, 5pm the day after the morrow goes in my diary. When I arrive, dripping wet and in a mood nearly as foul as the weather, it proves, as ever, impossible to get a reply on the entryphone. Fortunately, school security is compromised by a passing cleaner and I make my way up to the staff room. A handful of fellow parent and partnership governors have made it already; I am greeted by a tall, floppy-haired man with pale eyes and a short reddish beard. He looks strikingly like Boris Becker, except that when he speaks it is in a modified northern accent. He bids me hello and introduces himself as \"Jeff\", invites me to sit in the semi-circle of chairs he has arranged around an overhead projector. \"Hello, my name is Jeff Mayhew, and I am an instructor with Rebus, a human resources services company in education. My job today is to take you through the concept of performance management and how it is intended to work in the context of your school.\" He has this spiel down pat. I find myself switching off and wondering instead how someone like him ends up doing presentations for an outfit like Rebus. The possible biographical narratives seem a lot more interesting than the bullet-point paragraphs he has just illuminated on the projector. Perhaps this is a day-job for an aspiring actor. I like this: Jeff dreams of playing Hamlet, but today he is soliloquising about new initiatives in pay structures. \"So do you all know what threshold payments are?\" Jeff breaks the spell of my daydream by going into the interrogative. \"Well, you may have read earlier this year that David Blunkett decreed that teachers who had served a certain number of years were to receive a threshold payment, a lump sum of \u00a32,000. The teachers' unions succeeded in holding up its introduction in the courts, so the DfEE had to delay implementation. But it is now about to come in. By the beginning of next year, you - the school governors - will be required to have held a performance review of your head-teacher and set his or her salary accordingly,\" explains Jeff, scrupulously skirting around the political issues. It all sounds complicated and contentious: clearly, performance management is intended to shoe-horn into this vast public service leviathan a private-sector ethos of competitiveness and reward, introducing pay differentials and abolishing automatic length-of-service salary increments. But, as Jeff explains confidingly, much of what performance management replaces is similar to the existing system of teacher appraisal. The difference is that automatic pay increments for length of service have been abolished, which has upset the teachers' unions. But the good news is that the ceiling on teachers' earnings has also been removed, so that senior teachers can go on working the classroom without having, as in the past, to move into management in order to boost their salary. Fortunately for we governors, though, we have only to decide the salary of the head-teacher. Mr Richardson is answerable for the potentially divisive task of assessing the rest of the teaching staff. Jeff has established a rapport with his audience. At the end, I swear, if there were about three more people in the room, he would have got a round of applause. Perhaps Jeff shouldn't stick to the day-job.",

      "bodyText": "The government made a dramatic late concession last night after suffering a second defeat in the Lords over its plans to part-privatise the national air traffic control service (Nats). In an effort to ensure the crucial transport bill - with its plans to revive the railways - is pushed through by the end of the parliamentary ses sion this week ministers offered to delay the controversial sale for three months. The compromise came after Labour rebels joined Lib Dem and Tory peers to vote 132 to 125 for a Tory amendment for the sell-off to be deferred until after the general election, widely expected for May 3. The vote means the bill will have to be rushed back to the Commons again, where ministers will today insert a new amendment proposing the bill be made law at the end of this week, but the Nats sale be postponed until the end of February. Should the amendment not be accepted by peers, there still remains a risk the whole bill could be lost. Last night the transport minister, Lord MacDonald, said the measure was being \"brought forward in a spirit of compromise\" to enable more time to allay the fears of opponents of the sale. He blamed the 100 remaining \"hereditary peers\" for the defeat. \"The role is as a revising chamber: what it should not do is to try and frustrate the House of Commons,\" he told BBC 2's Newsnight. As peers reflected backbench disquiet in the Commons over the sell-off, however, Lord Stoddart of Swindon - one of three Labour rebels who spoke against the government - stressed he was opposing the plans \"with great regret\" to ensure \"this house isn't going to be a rubber stamp: it is going to give advice to the House of Commons\". Pointing out that the part-privatisation ran contrary to Labour's pre-election pledge, he added: \"It's a strange thing to ask Labour peers to do, at this point in time, the exact opposite of what we were told before the election that we should do. Some of us do have brains. \"I have been in the Labour party for 54 years, and I joined it because I believed that public ownership had a place in our economy, particularly where public safety was involved.\" Last night's air traffic control defeat followed another at the hands of the Lords earlier in the evening, when Tory and Lib Dem peers voted by 199 to 136, a majority of 63, to demand tax relief to political parties for donations of up to \u00a3500. The government will try to reverse this in the Commons tomorrow if the political parties, elections and referendums bill is to become law as planned by the end of this week. The constitutional dispute looked set to widen today when Lady Jay, leader of the Lords and the shadow leader, Lord Strathclyde, meet to discuss for the third time the terms of reference of the proposed joint committee of both houses which will consider the next stage of Lords reforms. Lord Strathclyde is insisting that a reformed second chamber should have a large elected element with full powers to act as a check on the Commons. Lady Jay is insisting that the committee should look only at \"parliamentary aspects\" of a reformed second chamber, and focus on the relative powers of the Commons and Lords, especially the power of the Lords to block legislation. The Conservatives believe the joint committee should also discuss the method of election of the second chamber. The Tories now favour a heavily elected second chamber with as much as 50% elected.

      "body": "<p>\"But I've never baked a cake in my life,\" I blurted out defensively. The chair of my children's school Parent Teacher Association fixed me with the determination that is the first requirement of any PTA chair. \"You don't need to bake cakes,\" she said. \"You work at home, don't you? You can write letters, make phone calls. Approach local companies for sponsorship, get gift vouchers for the fete.\" </p> <p>And so I became the secretary of the PTA. I'm not the most dedicated member, but I turn up, write letters when I'm asked to and send out the committee minutes (eventually). That's the name of the game with the PTA: you do what you can. And you know it makes a difference. </p> <p>In fact, PTAs in these days of tightened purse-strings are making more of a difference than ever. They refurbish classrooms and paint corridors: they organise the staging of the school play and overhaul the playground. They buy books and computers, pay for outings and fun days and make the mince pies for after the carol concert. Hardly a corner of school life, in fact, goes untouched by the PTA. </p> <p>And that's not all. According to Margaret Morrissey of the National Confederation of Parent Teacher Associations, the role of the PTA is expanding. \"They were first set up in the fifties to raise money for schools, and to give parents and teachers a chance to work together, and of course these elements remain crucial,\" she says. \"But what we're finding now is that, through the PTA, parents are demanding a bigger role - they're telling schools, we've raised all this money for you, and now we'll decide how we want to spend it. So you get PTAs that invite teachers along to give presentations about their work, and you get PTA members who are extremely closely involved in the whole planning and carrying out of projects.\" </p> <p>There's also, she says, a changing role for the PTA as a forum for parents' concerns. \"You get schools where this isn't happening- where the school would rather not have a PTA than have a PTA that tells it ... how it wants the school to change. But other, more open, schools are embracing this role for the PTA - with more parents working, it can be difficult if they're not at the school gates every day but want to be involved. For them, the chance to team up with other parents and to share worries and concerns can be a useful one.\" </p> <p>The nature of PTA fundraising is changing too - radically. More and more of us are phone-bashers and letter-writers. Because the more clued-up PTAs have realised that you can treble your income if you put your resources into chasing a grant or sponsorship. </p> <p>The first rule to bear in mind is that you need to know your market and plan something that will work given the kind of school you are. After that, it's all a question of how much you need to raise ... </p> <p><strong> \u00a3200 - \u00a3500</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Quiz nights </strong> are a good fundraiser in this price bracket - especially if you've got parents who are up for getting in a babysitter and having a night out. Charge for tickets, and have extra pay-as-you-play games on the night. The biggest headache is working out the questions in advance - but according to Judith Centofanti, chair of the Holy Ghost School PTA in Balham in south London, this needn't be too much of a challenge. \"It's quite an enjoyable task really,\" she says. The only other things you need to organise, apart from the use of the school hall, are food and drink on the night, and a prize for the winning team - and this can be a token rather than an expensive item. Another big plus is you really can involve the teachers - absolutely insist there's a teachers' team. Llynis Griffin, outgoing chair of the PTA at John Beddoes comprehensive school in Presteigne, Powys, says secondary schools such as hers even include pupil teams on quiz night. </p> <p> <strong> Raffle </strong> a big prize makes for a successful raffle, so get something special that's donated in return for publicity. Maybe a local cycle shop would donate a racing bike, or a toy shop might give a garden play house. If they won't donate, find someone who'll supply a prize at cost price in return for publicity. </p> <p> <strong> Car boot sale </strong> if yours is a small school, try a table-top sale instead - same principle, but in the school hall and sellers hire tables at \u00a35-\u00a310 each. </p> <p> <strong> Jar jamboree </strong> ask every family to fill an empty jam jar with something to sell - it could be sweets, herbs from the garden, home-made jam, bath salts - anything legal. Then sell the jars for \u00a31 or \u00a31.50 at a playground stall. </p> <p><strong> \u00a3500 - \u00a31,000</strong><br> </p> <p> An easy one in this category is a <strong> job week. </strong> Run it over half-term, and simply send children home with a letter and form asking parents to donate a suggested amount (eg 20p or 50p) for household tasks such as cleaning the car, making their own bed etc. Job week is usually welcomed by parents because it encourages the kids to take a bit of the strain, and though the individual amounts raised per child aren't great, it really does add up, even in a small school. </p> <p>Other ideas: a <strong> concert or talent show </strong>. \"Any kind of show in which as many of the children as possible are performing is a good idea - it's guaranteed to get the parents along,\" says Llynis Griffin. A <strong> promises auction </strong> - encourage parents with time, rather than money, to donate (eg a night's babysitting; a taxi service to and from a local restaurant for the evening), and parents with money, rather than time, to buy. </p> <p><strong> \u00a31,000 - \u00a35,000</strong><br> </p> <p> A <strong> sponsored bounce </strong> is a relatively painless way to raise \u00a32,000 or more. Hire a bouncy castle, or even a large trampoline, for a schoolday. Get teachers to bring their classes along and get the children to take turns bouncing - count how many bounces they do in a minute. Sponsor forms, and permission forms, will have already gone out to parents - and the cash just comes rolling in. </p> <p>A <strong> 100 club </strong> (or a 200 club or even a 500 club if you're a big school). This is a lottery - parents buy a number and pay a set amount for it by standing order. There's a monthly draw with a cash prize, and the rest is profit. </p> <p><strong> \u00a35,000 - \u00a310,000</strong><br> </p> <p> Many schools manage to raise several thousand pounds each year through their big, setpiece event such as a <strong> summer fete </strong> or <strong> Christmas bazaar</strong>. These events are, make no mistake, the hardest money the PTA makes. \"You usually get a lot of people who will run a one-off thing like a stall or make the teas for an hour or whatever, and you need to have a big list of those people and to be prepared to call on them,\" says Delia Perry, chair for two years of the Honeywell Junior and Infant School PTA in Battersea in south London. </p> <p>Most fetes and bazaars have a programme on which local companies can pay to advertise: but have you thought of getting sponsorship from larger companies to increase your takings? If you live in an area with a buoyant housing market, sound out estate agents: some will pay to supply balloons or awnings at the entrance, and to give out their publicity material. Some London schools have raised hundreds of pounds by getting 10-15 or more parents to agree to have the sponsor estate agent's board outside their house for the week of the fete - the board advertises the fete or says the agent \"supports the fundraising work of such-and-such a school\". When you're getting sponsors, think in terms of companies that will be looking to 30-something parents to buy their product. </p> <p><strong> \u00a310,000 - \u00a350,000</strong><br> </p> <p> If you need this kind of money, think <strong> grants. </strong> The world can be your oyster - parents at Heathbrook School in south London raised \u00a340,000 in just three months this year thanks to funds from bodies such as Walcot Endowed Charity, Sir Walter St John's Educational Charity and Bridge House Estates Trust Fund. The money has been used to overhaul the playground. The local council - in this case Lambeth - also boosted the funds by agreeing to match any money raised, again after an approach from the PTA. </p> <p>\"In approaching charities for funds our starting point was to put together a brochure about the school and the project we were trying to raise funds for,\" says Wendy Chandler, one of four key parents who worked to raise the money. \"That really helped - it showed we were professional and that we were serious.\" Don't think you can't raise this sort of money if you're a small school - with around 350 pupils Heathbrook, a primary, is medium-sized and, says Chandler, size isn't important when it comes to fundraising. </p> <p>\"What matters is good communication between the school and the PTA, feeling everyone is pulling together and having a core group of parents prepared to take on the project and put the work in.\" Finding the right charity to give your school a grant is the biggest headache. \"Which costs charities are able to help schools with is a huge grey area,\" says Jo Habib of the organisation Funder Finder. \"Some take a strong line and feel provision of basic educational facilities is a state responsibility, but others will be open to looking at funding anything that's more than the books and pens.\" Find a charity that could help you using the FunderFinder software - it's too pricey to buy, but if you call FunderFinder on 0113 2433008 they'll point you in the direction of a library or organisation near you that has it. The website at <a href=\"http://www.funderfinder.org.uk\">www.funderfinder.org.uk</a> has information you can download (in the Apply Yourselves package), which gives hints on how to write to trusts and what they're going to need to know about your project. </p> <p>Chandler's advice is that, even before you start looking for a fund-giver, there are certain things you need to check out about your PTA. </p> <p>To qualify for any grant, she says, you'll almost certainly need to be a registered charity, with a bank account and a constitution. Next step is to look carefully at a fund-giver's criteria before applying. </p> <p>\"You've got to fit what they're looking for, so do phone the administrator and talk it through. You'll find these people are quite approachable - what they're there for is to dish out funds, so they want to help all they can. </p> <p>\"Sometimes you need to be quite resourceful - a charity might not fund the buying of educational equipment per se, for example, but would fund an environmental project. Because our money was for a playground, we would then stress the environmental aspects - for other charities, we stressed the educational value or the fact that the children were involved in deciding what play equipment we bought.\" </p> <p>Some of the forms Chandler and her PTA colleagues filled in took two days to complete, but not all grant-givers require as much paperwork. The Save and Prosper Educational Trust, which donates around \u00a31m a year in grants of between \u00a3100 and \u00a310,000, requires simply an initial letter. \"It's really very simple, and we deliberately keep it like that so no one is put off applying,\" says the trust's administrator, Sharon Gormer. \"The letters are reviewed regularly and our trust director visits organisations we think we might be able to help.\" </p> <p>Like Chandler, she stresses the importance of tailoring an approach. \"We can't fund building work, but we can fund equipment. So if someone wrote asking us to help pay for a new library, we'd have to say no, but if they wrote asking for help with buying the furniture inside, we might be able to say yes.\" </p> <p>Chandler's advice is to find out what other projects a funder has given grants for, and possibly to speak to other PTAs that have been successful for tips. \"Another thing is, don't try to do too much on your own. You're going to do best if you can work in a team - it is very time-consuming work, and it does sometimes seem a bit daunting. But it is possible - and we'd never have believed when we started out at Easter that we'd be putting together our new playground over the summer.\" </p> <p>But it doesn't end with the go-ahead from the charity, of course: once the project is under way, the funding body will need to see carefully kept accounts including receipts for everything bought. You may also have to show the charity's representative around for one or more site visits.</p>",

      "bodyText": "\"But I've never baked a cake in my life,\" I blurted out defensively. The chair of my children's school Parent Teacher Association fixed me with the determination that is the first requirement of any PTA chair. \"You don't need to bake cakes,\" she said. \"You work at home, don't you? You can write letters, make phone calls. Approach local companies for sponsorship, get gift vouchers for the fete.\" And so I became the secretary of the PTA. I'm not the most dedicated member, but I turn up, write letters when I'm asked to and send out the committee minutes (eventually). That's the name of the game with the PTA: you do what you can. And you know it makes a difference. In fact, PTAs in these days of tightened purse-strings are making more of a difference than ever. They refurbish classrooms and paint corridors: they organise the staging of the school play and overhaul the playground. They buy books and computers, pay for outings and fun days and make the mince pies for after the carol concert. Hardly a corner of school life, in fact, goes untouched by the PTA. And that's not all. According to Margaret Morrissey of the National Confederation of Parent Teacher Associations, the role of the PTA is expanding. \"They were first set up in the fifties to raise money for schools, and to give parents and teachers a chance to work together, and of course these elements remain crucial,\" she says. \"But what we're finding now is that, through the PTA, parents are demanding a bigger role - they're telling schools, we've raised all this money for you, and now we'll decide how we want to spend it. So you get PTAs that invite teachers along to give presentations about their work, and you get PTA members who are extremely closely involved in the whole planning and carrying out of projects.\" There's also, she says, a changing role for the PTA as a forum for parents' concerns. \"You get schools where this isn't happening- where the school would rather not have a PTA than have a PTA that tells it ... how it wants the school to change. But other, more open, schools are embracing this role for the PTA - with more parents working, it can be difficult if they're not at the school gates every day but want to be involved. For them, the chance to team up with other parents and to share worries and concerns can be a useful one.\" The nature of PTA fundraising is changing too - radically. More and more of us are phone-bashers and letter-writers. Because the more clued-up PTAs have realised that you can treble your income if you put your resources into chasing a grant or sponsorship. The first rule to bear in mind is that you need to know your market and plan something that will work given the kind of school you are. After that, it's all a question of how much you need to raise ... \u00a3200 - \u00a3500 Quiz nights are a good fundraiser in this price bracket - especially if you've got parents who are up for getting in a babysitter and having a night out. Charge for tickets, and have extra pay-as-you-play games on the night. The biggest headache is working out the questions in advance - but according to Judith Centofanti, chair of the Holy Ghost School PTA in Balham in south London, this needn't be too much of a challenge. \"It's quite an enjoyable task really,\" she says. The only other things you need to organise, apart from the use of the school hall, are food and drink on the night, and a prize for the winning team - and this can be a token rather than an expensive item. Another big plus is you really can involve the teachers - absolutely insist there's a teachers' team. Llynis Griffin, outgoing chair of the PTA at John Beddoes comprehensive school in Presteigne, Powys, says secondary schools such as hers even include pupil teams on quiz night. Raffle a big prize makes for a successful raffle, so get something special that's donated in return for publicity. Maybe a local cycle shop would donate a racing bike, or a toy shop might give a garden play house. If they won't donate, find someone who'll supply a prize at cost price in return for publicity. Car boot sale if yours is a small school, try a table-top sale instead - same principle, but in the school hall and sellers hire tables at \u00a35-\u00a310 each. Jar jamboree ask every family to fill an empty jam jar with something to sell - it could be sweets, herbs from the garden, home-made jam, bath salts - anything legal. Then sell the jars for \u00a31 or \u00a31.50 at a playground stall. \u00a3500 - \u00a31,000 An easy one in this category is a job week. Run it over half-term, and simply send children home with a letter and form asking parents to donate a suggested amount (eg 20p or 50p) for household tasks such as cleaning the car, making their own bed etc. Job week is usually welcomed by parents because it encourages the kids to take a bit of the strain, and though the individual amounts raised per child aren't great, it really does add up, even in a small school. Other ideas: a concert or talent show . \"Any kind of show in which as many of the children as possible are performing is a good idea - it's guaranteed to get the parents along,\" says Llynis Griffin. A promises auction - encourage parents with time, rather than money, to donate (eg a night's babysitting; a taxi service to and from a local restaurant for the evening), and parents with money, rather than time, to buy. \u00a31,000 - \u00a35,000 A sponsored bounce is a relatively painless way to raise \u00a32,000 or more. Hire a bouncy castle, or even a large trampoline, for a schoolday. Get teachers to bring their classes along and get the children to take turns bouncing - count how many bounces they do in a minute. Sponsor forms, and permission forms, will have already gone out to parents - and the cash just comes rolling in. A 100 club (or a 200 club or even a 500 club if you're a big school). This is a lottery - parents buy a number and pay a set amount for it by standing order. There's a monthly draw with a cash prize, and the rest is profit. \u00a35,000 - \u00a310,000 Many schools manage to raise several thousand pounds each year through their big, setpiece event such as a summer fete or Christmas bazaar. These events are, make no mistake, the hardest money the PTA makes. \"You usually get a lot of people who will run a one-off thing like a stall or make the teas for an hour or whatever, and you need to have a big list of those people and to be prepared to call on them,\" says Delia Perry, chair for two years of the Honeywell Junior and Infant School PTA in Battersea in south London. Most fetes and bazaars have a programme on which local companies can pay to advertise: but have you thought of getting sponsorship from larger companies to increase your takings? If you live in an area with a buoyant housing market, sound out estate agents: some will pay to supply balloons or awnings at the entrance, and to give out their publicity material. Some London schools have raised hundreds of pounds by getting 10-15 or more parents to agree to have the sponsor estate agent's board outside their house for the week of the fete - the board advertises the fete or says the agent \"supports the fundraising work of such-and-such a school\". When you're getting sponsors, think in terms of companies that will be looking to 30-something parents to buy their product. \u00a310,000 - \u00a350,000 If you need this kind of money, think grants. The world can be your oyster - parents at Heathbrook School in south London raised \u00a340,000 in just three months this year thanks to funds from bodies such as Walcot Endowed Charity, Sir Walter St John's Educational Charity and Bridge House Estates Trust Fund. The money has been used to overhaul the playground. The local council - in this case Lambeth - also boosted the funds by agreeing to match any money raised, again after an approach from the PTA. \"In approaching charities for funds our starting point was to put together a brochure about the school and the project we were trying to raise funds for,\" says Wendy Chandler, one of four key parents who worked to raise the money. \"That really helped - it showed we were professional and that we were serious.\" Don't think you can't raise this sort of money if you're a small school - with around 350 pupils Heathbrook, a primary, is medium-sized and, says Chandler, size isn't important when it comes to fundraising. \"What matters is good communication between the school and the PTA, feeling everyone is pulling together and having a core group of parents prepared to take on the project and put the work in.\" Finding the right charity to give your school a grant is the biggest headache. \"Which costs charities are able to help schools with is a huge grey area,\" says Jo Habib of the organisation Funder Finder. \"Some take a strong line and feel provision of basic educational facilities is a state responsibility, but others will be open to looking at funding anything that's more than the books and pens.\" Find a charity that could help you using the FunderFinder software - it's too pricey to buy, but if you call FunderFinder on 0113 2433008 they'll point you in the direction of a library or organisation near you that has it. The website at www.funderfinder.org.uk has information you can download (in the Apply Yourselves package), which gives hints on how to write to trusts and what they're going to need to know about your project. Chandler's advice is that, even before you start looking for a fund-giver, there are certain things you need to check out about your PTA. To qualify for any grant, she says, you'll almost certainly need to be a registered charity, with a bank account and a constitution. Next step is to look carefully at a fund-giver's criteria before applying. \"You've got to fit what they're looking for, so do phone the administrator and talk it through. You'll find these people are quite approachable - what they're there for is to dish out funds, so they want to help all they can. \"Sometimes you need to be quite resourceful - a charity might not fund the buying of educational equipment per se, for example, but would fund an environmental project. Because our money was for a playground, we would then stress the environmental aspects - for other charities, we stressed the educational value or the fact that the children were involved in deciding what play equipment we bought.\" Some of the forms Chandler and her PTA colleagues filled in took two days to complete, but not all grant-givers require as much paperwork. The Save and Prosper Educational Trust, which donates around \u00a31m a year in grants of between \u00a3100 and \u00a310,000, requires simply an initial letter. \"It's really very simple, and we deliberately keep it like that so no one is put off applying,\" says the trust's administrator, Sharon Gormer. \"The letters are reviewed regularly and our trust director visits organisations we think we might be able to help.\" Like Chandler, she stresses the importance of tailoring an approach. \"We can't fund building work, but we can fund equipment. So if someone wrote asking us to help pay for a new library, we'd have to say no, but if they wrote asking for help with buying the furniture inside, we might be able to say yes.\" Chandler's advice is to find out what other projects a funder has given grants for, and possibly to speak to other PTAs that have been successful for tips. \"Another thing is, don't try to do too much on your own. You're going to do best if you can work in a team - it is very time-consuming work, and it does sometimes seem a bit daunting. But it is possible - and we'd never have believed when we started out at Easter that we'd be putting together our new playground over the summer.\" But it doesn't end with the go-ahead from the charity, of course: once the project is under way, the funding body will need to see carefully kept accounts including receipts for everything bought. You may also have to show the charity's representative around for one or more site visits.",

But changing the voting weights of governments, reducing the 20-strong commission, and abolishing vetoes are all proving extremely difficult. Such issues fundamentally concern how much power individual governments have in EU policy making and how much political clout should be kept in the national capitals. On vote re-weighting, the central issue is giving Germany, with 82m people, more votes than France, Britain and Italy, which all have about 59m. All four currently have 10 votes. Mr Blair can count on the support of Ireland, Luxembourg and probably Sweden on tax. But with so much at stake, and under the principle that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, the summit may go down to the wire. At a meeting of finance ministers in Brussels, Mr Brown said that a deal reached yesterday on the withholding tax issue was a vindication of Britain's long-haul negotiating tactics and British engagement in the EU. At the commission, Mr Barnier signalled trouble ahead on the charter of fundamental rights, which Eurosceptics regard as an embryonic EU constitution. He said the fact that it was more or less agreed that the document would be a political declaration and not legally binding would not stop the commission pressing later for the charter to be given full legislative weight. In a memorable, if unfortunate, comment Keith Vaz, the Foreign Office minister for Europe, quipped that the charter would have no more significance than a copy of the Beano. Yesterday Mr Vaz was back on the offensive as the political temperature rose. \"The usual suspects are now asserting that Nice will lead to nothing other than the end of the UK as a viable nation state, and that other heads of government are bent on creating a federal superstate,\" he said. \"Nothing could be further from the truth.\" The issues at Nice were left over from the Amsterdam treaty of 1997, precisely because they were so difficult to agree.

      "body": "<p>Leonard Selby, the protagonist of Christopher Nolan's superb new film Memento, is an alienated individual with no short-term memory who sets out to avenge his wife's murder. In order to keep a record of clues he would otherwise forget, Lenny has \"the facts\" tattooed on his chest, arms and legs. His body becomes a walking notepad, a constant reminder of his raison d' tre.</p> <p>As a commentary on the contemporary human condition, Memento is pertinent. Tattoos have never been so popular; in the US, an estimated one in seven people, or 39m Americans, have at least one. Here in Europe, tattoo parlours are flourishing as an ever-increasing number of young people go under the needle. Many are merely imitating their favourite stars. Indeed, it's probably easier to name the celebrities who don't have tattoos these days.</p> <p>In the UK, Robbie Williams leads the high-profile body-art gang, with a Maori design on his left arm, a lion's head above the motto Born To Be Mild on the right, and a Celtic cross on one thigh. In tribute to wife Sadie Frost, Jude Law has a line from a Beatles song along his forearm: \"You came along to turn on everyone Sexy Sadie.\"</p> <p>At least four Spice Girls had themselves inked at LA's Sunset Strip tattoo parlour (Emma Bunton will live to regret having \"Baby\" emblazoned on her ass, believe me), while even professional virgin Britney Spears has an angel on her back and is rumoured to have had another, \"more intimate\" tattoo. And then, of course, there is David Beckham, whose tattoos are front-page news.</p> <p>Over the centuries, tattoos have been marks of royalty, symbols of religious devotion, decorations for bravery, sexual lures and pledges of love. They have indicated membership of elites and gangs, and have served purposes varying from spiritual protection to the punishment of convicts and outcasts.</p> <p>In this materialist age, however, tattoos have become a kind of self-branding. In a world in which we construct our identities through the products we consume, tattoos are like logos; graphic reminders of who we think we are and what we believe we are doing.

      "bodyText": "Leonard Selby, the protagonist of Christopher Nolan's superb new film Memento, is an alienated individual with no short-term memory who sets out to avenge his wife's murder. In order to keep a record of clues he would otherwise forget, Lenny has \"the facts\" tattooed on his chest, arms and legs. His body becomes a walking notepad, a constant reminder of his raison d' tre. As a commentary on the contemporary human condition, Memento is pertinent. Tattoos have never been so popular; in the US, an estimated one in seven people, or 39m Americans, have at least one. Here in Europe, tattoo parlours are flourishing as an ever-increasing number of young people go under the needle. Many are merely imitating their favourite stars. Indeed, it's probably easier to name the celebrities who don't have tattoos these days. In the UK, Robbie Williams leads the high-profile body-art gang, with a Maori design on his left arm, a lion's head above the motto Born To Be Mild on the right, and a Celtic cross on one thigh. In tribute to wife Sadie Frost, Jude Law has a line from a Beatles song along his forearm: \"You came along to turn on everyone Sexy Sadie.\" At least four Spice Girls had themselves inked at LA's Sunset Strip tattoo parlour (Emma Bunton will live to regret having \"Baby\" emblazoned on her ass, believe me), while even professional virgin Britney Spears has an angel on her back and is rumoured to have had another, \"more intimate\" tattoo. And then, of course, there is David Beckham, whose tattoos are front-page news. Over the centuries, tattoos have been marks of royalty, symbols of religious devotion, decorations for bravery, sexual lures and pledges of love. They have indicated membership of elites and gangs, and have served purposes varying from spiritual protection to the punishment of convicts and outcasts. In this materialist age, however, tattoos have become a kind of self-branding. In a world in which we construct our identities through the products we consume, tattoos are like logos; graphic reminders of who we think we are and what we believe we are doing. In short, how we like to see ourselves. The \"casuals\" of the mid-80s took this behaviour to its logical extreme, by having Fred Perry, Fila and Lacoste logos tattooed on their chests, under the actual logo on their polo shirts. They wanted to identify themselves completely with what they saw as the unimpeachable coolness of such brands. Likewise, identification with an iconic image explains why Maradona has Che Guevara tattooed on one shoulder and Eric Cantona has a native American warrior-chief inked over his heart: both footballers see themselves as noble but rebellious anti-authoritarians, determined to overthrow the oppressor. David Beckham, however, is a different kind of footballer with very different tattoos. Across his lower back is his son's name; his second, across both shoulders and down his spine, is a guardian angel. And now, to much media consternation, along the inside of his forearm is his wife Victoria's name - in Hindi script. Beckham explained he and his wife had discussed the idea and \"agreed it would look a bit tacky if I just had 'Victoria' in English.\" Once again, he's right on the money. Hindi script has an air of eastern mystery to most westerners, who associate anything Indian with some vague, New Age spirituality. Being both ethnic and mystic, it scores highly on the fashion register. But Beckham's canny choice goes beyond the vagaries of style. In choosing Hindi, the Manchester United midfielder and England captain is distancing himself from the nationalist thugs who insult his wife and child when he plays for his country. Think about it: he's sticking two fingers up to every Union Jack-waving moron in the land. Perhaps even smarter, this latest tattoo is insured against Vine Leaf Syndrome, the tattooist's traditional solution when a former lover's name becomes an awkward reminder of an imperfect past: cover it up or rework it with some thick, tattooed vine leaves.

      "bodyText": "A lawyer acting for soldiers who fired at civil rights marchers during Bloody Sunday in Derry said yesterday he accepted that none of the 13 killed and 14 injured was armed. The statement, by Edwin Glasgow QC, contradicts the findings of the 1972 inquiry into the shootings, when the then lord chief justice, Lord Widgery, concluded there was \"strong evidence\" that some of those killed or injured had been firing weapons or handling bombs. Mr Glasgow was opening the case for 440 soldiers, who, he said, ranged from \"teenage recruits to senior high ranking officers\". Their involvement ranged from those \"in the frontline, who fired live rounds which undoubtedly killed, to those who really did little more than observe some peripheral activity\". Mr Glasgow told the inquiry into the events of January 30 1972: \"We will not contend ... that those individuals who have been identified were armed with lethal weapons. It follows, as has rightly been accepted for a long time, that innocent people were killed on Bloody Sunday\". His acceptance that none of those fired at by the soldiers was armed is at odds with claims made by lawyers representing other soldiers who link two identified casualties - Gerald Donaghey, who was killed, and Joseph Friel, who was injured - with weapons allegedly used on the day. Asked by Mr Justice Toohey about the case of Gerald Donaghey - his body was photographed with nail bombs in the pocket, which his family insists were planted - Mr Glasgow said the teenager was no different from anyone else on the list of dead and wounded. \"I accept without hesitation or reservation that for an innocent person to lose his life, even one, or for his life to be lost to his family and to his community in horrifying circumstances is one of the greatest tragedies that can occur.\" However, he added: \"For an innocent person, even one, to be accused of murder or of conspiracy to murder, where what he was doing or attempting to do was nothing more or less than his duty in those same horrific circumstances, is almost equally abhorrent.\" He described what the soldiers did as a \"reaction to mob violence and sustained and physical serious attacks\".

Mr Glasgow also claimed there were 34 more casualties who were never publicly acknowledged. These, he suggested, included gunmen and bombers attacking the soldiers. The inquiry has not found any evidence of unaccounted for casualties. Earlier, Mr Glasgow accused Martin McGuinness, Mid Ulster MP and Northern Ireland's education minister, of not having the \"courage, integrity or respect\" to cooperate with the inquiry. He said the process of handing information to the inquiry had so far been \"wholly and exceptionally\" one-sided, with no statements from the leading republicans of that era, including Mr McGuinness. Mr McGuinness issued a statement later saying Mr Glasgow's words were an attempt to deflect attention away from the weight of evidence that continued to be presented indicting the soldiers who opened fire on Bloody Sunday. Mr McGuinness said he had had meetings with his solicitor to determine the most adequate way of presenting his evidence. \"When that is decided I will inform the families.\" Last week, the inquiry, chaired by Lord Saville, threatened to subpoena Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist party, for refusing to cooperate with it.",

For decades the Soviet authorities insisted that Wallenberg had died of a heart attack in 1947 in a Soviet prison, but speculation about his fate grew into a full-blown mystery as gulag inmates surfaced to report sightings of the Swede in Siberia into the 1950s. Sweden has been pressing Moscow for decades for a proper investigation of the Wallenberg mystery and a joint Russian-Swedish commission was eventually established in 1997, the same year that Sergei Stepashin, Mr Putin's predecessor as prime minister and then justice minister, said that Wallenberg had probably been murdered by the NKVD. Mr Yakovlev was the key aide to Mikhail Gorbachev in the late 1980s who masterminded and promoted the policy of glasnost or openness and media freedom which did much to prise open the secrets of the Great Terror and overturn the cover-ups of history.

As the Texas governor began ostentatiously building a new Republican administration, Mr Gore was fighting on three fronts: challenging the election result in the Florida courts, rallying the Democratic party and taking his case to the public in a prime-time TV broadcast. The odds against Mr Gore remained long. But the vice-president kept hammering home his belief that every vote cast in Florida on November 7 should be counted before the presidency is awarded. His camp believes that in the three counties at issue the Democrats have been denied a net gain of more than 1,100 uncounted votes in Palm Beach and 750 in Miami-Dade, and that Mr Bush was wrongly credited with 51 votes in Nassau as part of his overall 537 majority. If this is right, the uncounted votes would be more than enough to hand Florida, and the White House, to Mr Gore. \"What we're talking about involves many thousands of votes that have never been counted at all,\" he said in a televised phone conversation with his party's congressional leaders Tom Daschle and Dick Gephardt yesterday. The two leaders went to Florida to head a show of unity for Mr Gore. But in the meantime Andy Card, whom Mr Bush has named as his putative White House chief-of-staff, was pumping out the Republicans' message about their man: \"He's getting ready to be a great president.\" Clay Johnson, Mr Bush's Texas chief of staff, was named as executive director of the transition team, and Ari Fleischer as press spokesman. To add to the appearance of momentum, the senate majority leader, Trent Lott, told committee chairmen to convene their members on January 4 to begin confirmation hearings on Bush cabinet nominees. But the 80,000 square feet of government offices set aside in central Washington for the transition team stayed locked. Federal officials from the General Services Agency said that the law required them to withhold the keys while the election outcome was in doubt. The Republican vice-presidential nominee, Dick Cheney, said he was \"disappointed\" at this. The Bush campaign, he announced, would set up offices in Washington funded from private contributions. \"We feel it is our obligation to the American people to honour their votes by moving forward and assembling the administration they've chosen,\" he said.

      "bodyText": "Israeli troops are making increasing use of live ammunition against Palestinian protesters, according to an internal United Nations report obtained by the Guardian. Live fire now exceeds rubber-coated steel bullets, it says, and this has driven up casualties during the past two months of communal conflict in Israel and the Palestinian territories. The finding has emerged from a study of Palestinian deaths and injuries by the policy unit of the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA). It has charted a steady rise in injuries from live fire since October 1, three days after the start of the Palestinian uprising, and a parallel decline in the use of rubber-coated bullets. Since November 15 - the anniversary of a symbolic declaration of Palestinian independence which saw 10 Arabs shot dead by Israeli forces in the West Bank and Gaza - the use of live fire has exceeded rubber bullets. Last week, 70%-80% of all Palestinian injuries were caused by live bullets, the report says. The study's other findings are in line with reports from international human rights organisations which document Israeli troops targetting the head and upper body, a policy blamed for the casualty figures: more than 280 dead in two months, and nearly 9,000 injured, almost all Palestinian. The UNRWA report, which is based on statistics provided by the Palestinian Red Crescent Society, also notes the many children among the dead - 28% aged below 16. The graph also indicates that on several days there was no use of rubber bullets before a resort to live ammunition. Last week, the journalist Amira Hass published a chilling account of a day in the life of an Israeli sharpshooter in the Ha'aretz newspaper. The high velocity bullets used by the Israeli snipers break up inside the body. \"Every day before we go out they define the principles for opening fire,\" the sniper told Ha'aretz. \"This also changes from place to place.\" Commanders loosened restrictions after a Palestinian mob hacked and burned two Israeli reservists to death in Ramallah on October 12, the man said. \"After the lynch, for example, the orders for opening fire were far more lenient than they had been the day before.\" The unnamed sniper added: \"Every time, after there is a serious incident, it's political, you can feel it.\" But he also said that commanders often held back trigger-happy conscripts, and were terrified of shooting children after the outpouring of condemnation of the killing of Mohammed al-Durreh, a Gaza boy shot dead in his father's arms in front of TV cameras. \"You don't shoot at a child who is 12 or younger,\" he told Ha'aretz. \"Twelve and up is allowed. He is not a child any more, he is already after his bar mitzvah.\" The UN made its findings available on the day when George Mitchell, a former US senator who was a key mediator in the Northern Ireland accord, formally started work on a fact-finding commission looking into the violence. He is to submit his report in March. The UN human rights chief, Mary Robinson, yesterday spoke out in favour of an international monitoring body for the region - a demand Israel categorically rejects. \"The thrust of the [UNRWA] report is urgently calling international attention to the bleak human rights situation in occupied territories,\" Ms Robinson said in Geneva yesterday. She called for \"measures to be taken to reduce the terrible violence\". Israeli army officials argue that soldiers have been forced to use live fire by Arab gunmen who hide among crowds of civilians and children. Earlier this month, an army legal expert, Colonel Daniel Reisner, said: \"The current situation has more of a semblance of war than of peace,\" and \"as a result, we are also applying the principles applicable to warfare.\" According to him, the main change of strategy has been to target and assassinate men Israel accuses of leading militias that have attacked its soldiers and settlers.",

      "bodyText": "It was meant as a very public statement of love and affection. But last night David Beckham was left with a face as red as his Manchester United shirt after it emerged that a tattoo on his arm bearing his wife Victoria's name in Hindi has been misspelt. The letter H was incorrectly included, leaving his wife's name reading as VIHCTORIA. Hindi experts in Britain spotted the mistake yesterday after Beckham was photographed wearing a T-shirt showing off the misspelt tattoo, done in Hindi because he liked the look of the language. Padmesh Gupta, president of the United Kingdom Hindi committee and editor of Purvai, a Hindi language magazine said: \"Whoever wrote this tattoo is clearly not a Hindi expert. There is no H in Victoria when it is written in Hindi.\" A spokesman for the Hindi department at the Indian High Commission in central London said: \"Victoria is a name that we are used to writing in Hindi because of Queen Victoria. I can assure you that there is no H in Victoria. \"But the tattoo is quite artistic and it is good that Hindi is getting this sort of publicity.\" Beckham's agents appeared bemused yesterday over the spelling and the word Hindi itself. A spokeswoman for Outside Organisation, which looks after Beckham's non-footballing interests, said with authority: \"You have to understand that there is a difference between Hindi and Hindu. The tattoo has been checked by a Hindu expert. It's not as if David Beckham just walked into a tattoo parlour and got it done. It was carefully designed.\" When told that Hindi is a language and Hindu a religion, the spokeswoman insisted: \"We know the tattoo is spelt correctly.\" A spokeswoman for SFX, which looks after Beckham's football interests, said: \"Oh dear, I'll have to tell David there's a mistake on his arm next time he telephones in.\"",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>There's a screen at the end of a corridor built through one of the ICA's upper galleries. On it, a couple of girls are hanging around in a room filled with a pop band's gear, a foldaway bed, and a coffeepot on a stove. They wander in and out of frame, in and out of focus. Bored, they bounce a volleyball around, and occasionally one of them leaves the room for a minute. </p> <p>Christ, this is dull, I think - typical ICA balls-achingly boring stuff. My mind wanders: oh dear, oh dearie me, the critic's lot. One of the girls is just sitting there, mouth open, immobile. Bounce, bounce, bounce goes the ball. The sound quality's good - that's one thing you can say. And the door opening and closing, it could almost be in the next room. And is it me, or do I smell coffee? Hang on - it is in the next room: this is live, and happening just over the wall from where I'm leaning. </p> <p>The camera is slowly zooming in and out, focusing on a life-size head stuck to the wall. Now the head fills the screen. It looks like a slightly inane, blue-eyed, dyed-blonde Dutchman - a football star maybe, or a Netherlandish Jean-Paul Gaultier lookalike. Definitely a denizen of one of those Amsterdam dope bars. Here he comes again. </p> <p>The girls next door, it turns out, are students from Central St Martins art college in London, co-opted into this stultifying drama. I guess their servitude in this installation, Sliding Room, isn't much different from being in college - hanging around all day in a little studio cubicle, waiting not for Godot, but for a tutor who never comes, and who probably wouldn't be worth talking to if he did. </p> <p>One begins to think of all this in terms of a behavioural experiment, except for that damned head stuck to the wall. His slack-mouthed, blank countenance mimics the boredom of the scene. He, too, appears mesmerised by the dullness of it. Why, you ask, why? </p> <p>Welcome to the world according to Dutch artist Aernout Mik. It is a place where people hang around doing odd things, or almost nothing at all, for a very long time, and in what we might call challenging circumstances. I first saw Mik's work - and was confused, amused and alarmed at it - in the Dutch pavilion at the Venice Biennale five years ago. </p> <p>In one video, a bunch of pugnacious old guys were milling about, having a senior citizens' punch-up in a kitchen. In another, a sullen group lounged around in a white space, connected to fat hosepipes that gurgled and spouted and leaked blue goo through their clothing. They had an air of normality, unperturbed by their situation. </p> <p>Mik's 3 Crowds, an exhibition of three works (two of which have been specially made for the space), is the first decent exhibition of new work at the ICA for a very long time. A second two-screen video, Pi\u00f1ata, shows a white room where a group of middle-aged people are smashing things up. </p> <p>There's soil on the floor, and they're hacking away at a lot of chunky, pink-painted polystyrene blocks. The task is endless, as more blocks get hurled on-screen whenever it looks like their job might be done. A lot of chairs need smashing to bits, too, and a couple of people are wrenching a perfectly serviceable baby-buggy apart with their bare hands. A man with his shirt off, a sort of amateur Hercules, wields the back of a dining-room chair, going at the polystyrene chunks like a biblical hero with an ass's jaw as his only weapon. </p> <p>The women, on the other hand, are more diligent and concentrated, hacking those chunks of plastic down into little chips. Then a whole lot of earth falls from above, in a great whooshing cloud of dust, as though someone had just emptied a giant bag of garden peat into the room. No one seems to notice. Their labour is never done. Bring on more chairs. </p> <p>A work called Lumber fills the downstairs gallery. You walk in through a chest-high corridor, to a central space where an array of screens show disconnected views of a crowd, outdoors in the mud. Mats on the floor encourage you to sit, as though among them. Along the way, one passes a rubber disc set flush with the wall. Connected to an air pump, it flexes in and out, as though the wall itself were breathing. I don't know what this means. It must mean something. </p> <p>The people lounge about on besmirched blankets, on bits of polythene and on opened-up cardboard boxes. Some have thought to bring inflatable mattresses. Here's a yellow beach parasol, wearing a tide-line of mud. Bright colours - a gaudy poncho, a red blanket - make this brown and grey world look worse. </p> <p>The sun comes out, more as an insult than as a promise, because it soon goes in again. It is coming on to rain now. The cameras scan the crowds, the little groups on their mud allotments. Everything is caked in mud, clogged in mud, slowly sinking into the mire. Feet squelch past, through the rubbish and scummy puddles. Someone in a wheelchair churns slowly by. </p> <p>You have to be really keen, drunk or stoned to stay here: it is like a pop festival on the Somme. A truly horrible scene, this Europe after the rain. The camera lingers. There's a baby-stroller; here's a couple of sorry-looking dogs, making the best of it. Some of the people are trying to sunbathe or to sleep, and to ignore their circumstances. Others are sitting up, clapping to an unseen band playing on a stage miles away. We neither see the band nor hear it: the footage is silent. In fact, these bog people are the main attraction. </p> <p>You come out feeling queasy, a bit sea-sick, after spending time among them. It could be the sway and pitch of the camera, the disjointedness of the multiple projections. But what eventually strikes you, staring at your on-screen fellows, is the peculiarity of their movements. They appear at times almost to levitate, or to lift themselves up from their blankets with an unnatural slowness, and without seeming to prop themselves up. It is as if the mud, instead of sucking them down, were rejecting them. At first you don't notice this. Only later did I learn that there were people hidden in holes under the mud, pushing upwards from below. And that the footage was not shot at some Dutch popfest, but staged by Mik. </p> <p>What we have been watching are exercises in entropy - worlds running out of energy, things breaking down, returning to the earth. It strikes me that this is a very Low Countries obsession: think of the work of Belgian sculptor Thierry de Cordier, or the early, mud-coloured, big-booted works of Van Gogh. </p> <p>I recall the earthiness of Beuys, born in the north German flatlands near the Dutch border; and of Dutch sculptor Mark Manders, his root-like figures, attenuated, parsnip-like golems. Yet placing Mik's work is not so easy. He uses video, a projected record of a performance in a constructed space, but the place where you watch it is also staged - another set. His work can be read as a meditation on sculpture - on mass, form, liquidity, inertia, the interaction of people and things. </p> <p>It is also intensely choreographed. Unlike, say, American artist Anne Hamilton and the performers in her tableaux, Mik does not treat people as living props, or merely as bodies. There's a psychology at work here. His works remind me, too, of the sculptural situations and routines in Pina Bausch's dance works: her use of the stage as more than a container, and of objects as more than things. </p> <p>Mik re-invigorates the different media his work touches. Best of all, leaving the ICA, you begin to see the world his way, something that only good art does. Leave a Rembrandt show (and there's another Dutch artist whose work meditates on entropy - on bodies, time, earth and death) and everyone has Rembrandt wrinkles. </p> <p>After Mik, the shoppers on Piccadilly walk in slow time, picking at inexplicable presentations of rags in stagey clothes shops, maundering about in that weird shopping light, blundering and transfixed, at once mesmerised and lost. They wander in and out, going nowhere. Entropy and rain are in the air, and the whole world feels like an installation. </p> <p>\u0095 Aernout Mik: 3 Crowds is at the Institute of Contemporary Arts, London SW1 (020-7930 3647), until January 7.</p>",

His works remind me, too, of the sculptural situations and routines in Pina Bausch's dance works: her use of the stage as more than a container, and of objects as more than things. Mik re-invigorates the different media his work touches. Best of all, leaving the ICA, you begin to see the world his way, something that only good art does. Leave a Rembrandt show (and there's another Dutch artist whose work meditates on entropy - on bodies, time, earth and death) and everyone has Rembrandt wrinkles. After Mik, the shoppers on Piccadilly walk in slow time, picking at inexplicable presentations of rags in stagey clothes shops, maundering about in that weird shopping light, blundering and transfixed, at once mesmerised and lost. They wander in and out, going nowhere. Entropy and rain are in the air, and the whole world feels like an installation. \u0095 Aernout Mik: 3 Crowds is at the Institute of Contemporary Arts, London SW1 (020-7930 3647), until January 7.",

In letters to Nato secretar,y general, George Robertson and the UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, Mr Kostunica pressed for \"concrete deeds, not supportive words\", saying that Serbia was sticking to its side of a security bargain for the zone which had tied its hands. The Albanian guerrilla group's commander, Shefqet Musliu, appeared in defiant mood, despite the increase in Yugoslav troops in the region and news that the Serbian ceasefire had been extended until Friday. Speaking from his headquarters in Dobrosin, half a mile from the boundary with Kosovo, he said he did not have faith in the Serbs keeping their word. \"We are happy to keep the ceasefire but, as we all know from Kosovo, lots of KLA fighters were betrayed in ceasefires,\" he said. \"We are keeping our eyes open and we are in our positions, and I say that if a Serb even gets with in 200 to 300 metres we will open fire.\" He spoke in an office, alongside two of his deputies.

The statement contradicted the traditional Soviet line on Wallenberg, who helped thousands of Jews flee the Holocaust and disappeared in 1945 in Budapest after Soviet troops arrested him. In 1957 the Soviets said they had a doctor's note from 1947 showing that Wallenberg had died of a heart attack that year at the age of 34 in the Lubyanka, headquarters of the NKVD secret police. A Russian-Swedish committee has been set up to investigate what exactly happened to Wallenberg after his arrest. \"Now we have no doubts he was shot in the Lubyanka,\" Interfax quoted Alexander Yakovlev, head of the Presidential Commission on the Rehabilitation of Victims of Political Repression, as saying. He said he expected the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, to issue a decree rehabilitating Wallenberg. \"[The decree will say that] Wallenberg was a victim of Stalin's repression.\" Mr Yakovlev said that some of Wallenberg's possessions had been handed over to Swedish officials.

      "bodyText": "Cammell Laird workers yesterday launched the 26,000-ton midsection of the Italian cruise ship Costa Classica on the Mersey from the company's Birkenhead yard. But the 45-metre section will stay in Cammell's wet basin until resolution of a legal dispute between the company and the ship's owner, Costa Crociere, over the \u00a351m contract. The Italians last week forced the captain of the Costa Classica to turn around off the coast of Spain and head home for Genoa, claiming that the British yard had breached its contract through substantial delays and failing to complete the top decks of the section. Cammell, which rejects the Italian cruise line's claim for arbitration, is to hold talks with union officials later this week about the possibility of hundreds of lay-offs among the 1,000-strong workforce. The AEEU union, which has accused the Italians of \"commercial piracy\", said it sided with Cammell and would do all it could to help resolve the unwarranted dispute.",

Old Lady under fire from Unifi The Bank of England is being sued over the sacking of six staff who refused to sign \"inferior\" contracts.

      "body": "<p>Al Gore launched a three-pronged legal challenge in Tallahassee yesterday to the election results certified in Florida on Sunday night, which gave victory in the presidential race to his Republican rival, George W Bush.</p> <p>The thrust of his argument is that many votes have still not been counted properly and that more than 10,000 votes have not been counted at all.</p> <p>Effectively, the challenges are as follows:</p> <p>\u0095In Miami-Dade county the Gore team seeks the completion of the manual recount which was stopped, in the words of the legal summary of the action, \"after a mob intimidated the canvassing board to reverse a decision - made just hours earlier - to complete the count\".</p> <p>This is a reference to Republican supporters who protested noisily in the counting building and, say the Democrats, affected the canvassing board's judgment.</p> <p>There are also about 10,000 ballots that were not counted because the machine in Miami-Dade could not read them. The action seeks to have these votes counted. In addition, the suit seeks to include at least the 368 votes that were counted in a partial recount which showed a net gain for Mr Gore of 156 votes. <br></p> <p>\u0095 In Nassau county the canvassing board rejected a machine recount which gave an extra 51 votes to Mr Gore. He is now seeking to have those votes included. <br> \u0095 In Palm Beach county the Gore team seeks a judicial review of the ballots because it does not believe that the canvassing board \"determined the voter's intent\".</p> <p>The Democrats suggest that up to 2,000 ballots were improperly rejected by the board, and say that they could give Mr Gore a net gain of between 300 and 600 votes. Hundreds of indented ballots were not counted, they allege. They will also challenge the decision by the Florida secretary of state, Katherine Harris, not to allow the hand recount votes.</p> <p>At the heart of the action, as Democrat lawyers explained at the weekend, is a belief that many votes that were intended for the vice-president have still not been counted.</p> <p>Once Miami-Dade decided not to continue hand-counting, Mr Gore's team knew that it would have an uphill battle.

      "bodyText": "Al Gore launched a three-pronged legal challenge in Tallahassee yesterday to the election results certified in Florida on Sunday night, which gave victory in the presidential race to his Republican rival, George W Bush. The thrust of his argument is that many votes have still not been counted properly and that more than 10,000 votes have not been counted at all. Effectively, the challenges are as follows: \u0095In Miami-Dade county the Gore team seeks the completion of the manual recount which was stopped, in the words of the legal summary of the action, \"after a mob intimidated the canvassing board to reverse a decision - made just hours earlier - to complete the count\". This is a reference to Republican supporters who protested noisily in the counting building and, say the Democrats, affected the canvassing board's judgment. There are also about 10,000 ballots that were not counted because the machine in Miami-Dade could not read them. The action seeks to have these votes counted. In addition, the suit seeks to include at least the 368 votes that were counted in a partial recount which showed a net gain for Mr Gore of 156 votes. \u0095 In Nassau county the canvassing board rejected a machine recount which gave an extra 51 votes to Mr Gore. He is now seeking to have those votes included. \u0095 In Palm Beach county the Gore team seeks a judicial review of the ballots because it does not believe that the canvassing board \"determined the voter's intent\". The Democrats suggest that up to 2,000 ballots were improperly rejected by the board, and say that they could give Mr Gore a net gain of between 300 and 600 votes. Hundreds of indented ballots were not counted, they allege. They will also challenge the decision by the Florida secretary of state, Katherine Harris, not to allow the hand recount votes. At the heart of the action, as Democrat lawyers explained at the weekend, is a belief that many votes that were intended for the vice-president have still not been counted. Once Miami-Dade decided not to continue hand-counting, Mr Gore's team knew that it would have an uphill battle. The team decided at that stage that it would pursue the legal challenges and has tried to prepare the US public for this. The complaint has been filed in Leon county circuit court. The plaintiffs are listed as Al Gore, Joe Lieberman, Mr Gore's running mate, and the Florida Democratic party. The defendants are the canvassing boards of Miami-Dade, Nassau and Palm Beach, George W Bush, his running mate, Dick Cheney, and Katherine Harris. A separate legal action was launched by voters in Seminole county, where Republican officials had filled in the identification numbers missing on 4,700 absentee ballots. If the ID numbers had been missing, the votes would have been discarded. Individual voters have filed suit alleging that this is illegal. According to a Gore spokesman, the vice-president's team will not join this action, even though most of the votes that would be dismissed would be Republican. It is felt in the Gore camp that, since the Democrats are arguing that every intended vote should count, it would be hypocritical to challenge on a technicality votes that were clearly stated. However, a strict legal ruling could still throw out the votes, putting Mr Gore ahead. The case was transferred yesterday to the state court in Tallahassee which is handling other challenges, a court official said. The Bush team is continuing with a US supreme court case due to be heard on Friday. This will seek to rule out all hand recounts that have taken place, thus confirming a Bush victory. Defeat for Mr Bush here would have a damaging effect on his credibility but might not affect the result.",

      "bodyText": "As the Gore campaign went to court yesterday in an attempt to overturn George W Bush's victory certification in Florida, it faced a parallel and equally important battle for public opinion on a playing field which was tilting increasingly against the vice-president. Senior Democrats insisted that Sunday night's formal certification by Katherine Harris, Florida's Republican secretary of state, did not cement Governor Bush's status as president-elect. But most analysts agreed that the Gore team faced the tough task of warding off a sense of inevitability gathering around the idea of a Bush administration. A snap poll conducted by ABC News and the Washington Post found that 60% of those asked thought Mr Gore should stand down, including 26% of his own supporters. As sports analogies abounded, even Democrats were conceding that it was one thing to argue with the umpire but quite another to carry on quarrelling once the umpire had passed judgment. Meanwhile the Bush camp was striving to deepen the sense of finality underlying Ms Harris's pronouncement without appearing too presumptious. For the first time since the vote, campaign officials talked openly about preparations for the White House, although they avoided using the phrase \"president-elect\". Despite this note of caution, Democratic party support for the vice-president's legal efforts appears to have been galvanised by Republican behaviour. Orchestrated raucous protests in Miami-Dade county were described by one Democrat official as \"brownshirt tactics\". Even before Mr Bush made his television appearance, Mr Gore's staff telephoned executives of television networks and major newspapers urging them to avoid portraying Mr Bush as the country's 43rd president-in-waiting. Their effort succeeded, for headline writers largely avoided annointing Mr Bush as the winner, focusing instead on Friday's supreme court hearing on the election as the next critical bout in a continuing struggle. Time and Newsweek portrayed both candidates on their covers, albeit with Mr Bush in the foreground and the vice-president peering over his shoulder. Opinion articles in the principal newspapers reflected the uphill task now facing Mr Gore. While pro-Republican columnists roundly condemned the vice-president, normally staunch Democrats offered only tepid defences. Ironically, the Bush campaign team's decision last week to appeal to the supreme court may buy the Gore camp a few more days of public patience, while the vice-president's lawyers scramble for votes in the Florida counties. \"He had better find a court somewhere that will allow those votes ... to be counted pretty quickly,\" Bob Herbert, a liberal commentator for the New York Times, warned. \"Because time is running out for Mr Gore.\"",

The consultant is suffering from brain damage and was found unfit to plead by a previous jury. The hearing is a \"finding of fact\" trial, a relatively unusual legal process to decide, in the absence of a plea, whether he committed the four rapes and 15 indecent assaults that have been alleged.

      "body": "<p>Sven-Goran Eriksson may take up his post as England manager as early as next week, if Lazio's run of bad form continues. </p> <p> Despite public backing from Lazio's president Sergio Cragnotti, sources close to the club suggest that if Lazio lose to Leeds in the Stadio Olimpico on Tuesday night, Eriksson's career with the club will be over. Even a draw may not be enough to save him. </p> <p> Having lost 1-0 away to Anderlecht on Wednesday, Lazio were beaten 2-0 at Parma in Serie A on Sunday, prompting fans on the Curva Nord to hold up a banner reading \"Eriksson Go\". Sunday's defeat was the team's fourth of the season, adding to the pressures that Eriksson brought on himself by pledging his future allegiance elsewhere. </p> <p> The Swede defended himself with his usual dignity on Sunday night. \"I've never thought of resigning and I'm not going to,\" he said. \"Lazio's problems are elsewhere. I'm not the problem and that banner from the fans leaves me indifferent.\" </p> <p> Cragnotti added that the banner was the work of \"unstable fans who are incorrigible\". </p> <p> The fact that Leeds could hold Eriksson's future in their hands is an irony. The Leeds chairman Peter Ridsdale was on the FA's head-hunting panel that chose Eriksson for the England job. Now, he could be instrumental in getting his man here early. That would certainly end the speculation about what is going to happen for England's friendly with Spain at Villa Park in February. </p> <p> It was originally intended that the Swede would see out his contract with the Roman club before taking up his post as England manager in June. </p> <p> Should Lazio terminate Eriksson's contract they would have a ready-made caretaker replacement in their former coach Dino Zoff, who resigned as national team manager following Euro 2000 after he was criticised by the Milan president Silvio Berlusconi and returned to Lazio in an administrative role. </p> <p> Roberto Mancini, the 35-year-old former Sampdoria and Italy striker who is being groomed by Eriksson to be his successor, may not be thought of as quite ready for the top job, having only recently retired from playing. Alternative targets, such as Marcello Lippi, recently fired as Internazionale coach, and Alberto Zaccheroni, under pressure at Milan, may not be as readily available. </p> <p> Yesterday the FA played down reports that Peter Taylor would refuse to take charge of the England team for the game against Spain if Eriksson picked the team in preparation for the World Cup qualifiers against Finland and Albania in March. </p> <p> Taylor was reported as saying at the weekend: \"If I have the title of team manager for that game I would have to have the main input into the team. I will have to have a word about it if that is the plan.\" </p> <p> Taylor is due in Italy this week to meet Eriksson for the first time and discuss strategy for the match. Eriksson's right-hand man, Tord Grip, who has been monitoring England's players in the Premiership, will also be present. </p> <p> The FA remains confident that some time this week it will be able to confirm that Taylor and Manchester United's No2 Steve McClaren will take charge of the England side for the game against Spain. The pair led England in their last match, a 1-0 friendly defeat by Italy in Turin.</p> <p>\u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

      "bodyText": "Sven-Goran Eriksson may take up his post as England manager as early as next week, if Lazio's run of bad form continues. Despite public backing from Lazio's president Sergio Cragnotti, sources close to the club suggest that if Lazio lose to Leeds in the Stadio Olimpico on Tuesday night, Eriksson's career with the club will be over. Even a draw may not be enough to save him. Having lost 1-0 away to Anderlecht on Wednesday, Lazio were beaten 2-0 at Parma in Serie A on Sunday, prompting fans on the Curva Nord to hold up a banner reading \"Eriksson Go\". Sunday's defeat was the team's fourth of the season, adding to the pressures that Eriksson brought on himself by pledging his future allegiance elsewhere. The Swede defended himself with his usual dignity on Sunday night. \"I've never thought of resigning and I'm not going to,\" he said. \"Lazio's problems are elsewhere. I'm not the problem and that banner from the fans leaves me indifferent.\" Cragnotti added that the banner was the work of \"unstable fans who are incorrigible\". The fact that Leeds could hold Eriksson's future in their hands is an irony. The Leeds chairman Peter Ridsdale was on the FA's head-hunting panel that chose Eriksson for the England job. Now, he could be instrumental in getting his man here early. That would certainly end the speculation about what is going to happen for England's friendly with Spain at Villa Park in February. It was originally intended that the Swede would see out his contract with the Roman club before taking up his post as England manager in June. Should Lazio terminate Eriksson's contract they would have a ready-made caretaker replacement in their former coach Dino Zoff, who resigned as national team manager following Euro 2000 after he was criticised by the Milan president Silvio Berlusconi and returned to Lazio in an administrative role. Roberto Mancini, the 35-year-old former Sampdoria and Italy striker who is being groomed by Eriksson to be his successor, may not be thought of as quite ready for the top job, having only recently retired from playing. Alternative targets, such as Marcello Lippi, recently fired as Internazionale coach, and Alberto Zaccheroni, under pressure at Milan, may not be as readily available. Yesterday the FA played down reports that Peter Taylor would refuse to take charge of the England team for the game against Spain if Eriksson picked the team in preparation for the World Cup qualifiers against Finland and Albania in March. Taylor was reported as saying at the weekend: \"If I have the title of team manager for that game I would have to have the main input into the team. I will have to have a word about it if that is the plan.\" Taylor is due in Italy this week to meet Eriksson for the first time and discuss strategy for the match. Eriksson's right-hand man, Tord Grip, who has been monitoring England's players in the Premiership, will also be present. The FA remains confident that some time this week it will be able to confirm that Taylor and Manchester United's No2 Steve McClaren will take charge of the England side for the game against Spain. The pair led England in their last match, a 1-0 friendly defeat by Italy in Turin. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.

So we have to be content to watch him shake a leg and strike a pose instead. </p> <p>Workman, with his waistcoat and flowery necktie, is a strange combination of wild-west hustler and Oscar Wilde, his gait and movements those of a dandy, his voice by turns Tim Buckley and David Bowie. And his in-between-songs patter has the deferential crowd wondering whether to be charmed or simply amused. </p> <p>\"I brought my guitar in on a camel,\" Workman announces in one of his surreal diatribes, to scattered giggles and an awkward silence as the worthy ponder his words for hidden meaning. \"You mean you've got the hump with it?\" a brave soul asks. With his target in sight, Workman raises an eyebrow. \"Hey, I guess we could put the spotlight around.\" </p> <p>Not that that's likely. It's clear he's out to grab and maintain our attention, even though he sings with his eyes tightly shut. Stop Joking Around is a blues number from the debut album For Him and the Girls that showcases Workman's voice as it glides one moment, screams the next, in a fit of vocal gymnastics that would send Mariah Carey crying back to her singing teacher. But rather than trilling for trilling's sake, Workman uses his amazing range as a tool to complement the raw sounds of his guitar, his odd little noises enhancing the chords. With each screech and squeak, he moves his body, like a doll that cries when you press its stomach. There's a fey flick of the wrist as he reaches a high note, while a controlled kick marks a pause in the proceedings, before the intricate guitar parts start again. Wiping the sweat away from his eyes becomes a protracted, graceful interlude. </p> <p>It's a charismatic and endearing performance, but one that detracts from the simple loveliness of the songs. Workman doesn't seem to be able to decide whether or not he wants to be a stylish mime artist or a lovelorn musician, and in trying to be both he leaves us confused, his eccentricity unique but uncomfortable. </p> <p>When he stops putting on a show and gets down to singing, it's easy to get lost in the moment, as Workman's passion and attachment for his songs shines blindingly from him. Safe and Sound, with its romantic intentions and waltzy rhythm, is warm and poetic, while Don't Be Crushed is the perfect airport goodbye to the one you love. </p> <p>As Workman holds a pitch-perfect high note for an inordinately long time, I start to fear for the glass in my hand and feel thankful he didn't break into a Fred Astaire dance routine after all. </p> <p>\u0095 Further performances at the 12 Bar Club, London WC2 (020-7916 6989), on Thursday and December 7. </p>",

Faced with such apparently incompatible elements, Weir's solution has been to disregard the distinction between eastern and western instruments, and to fashion an economically-scaled tone-poem through which Naidu extemporises her story like an extended, verbal cadenza. This is intoxicating stuff, especially when offered intimately beneath atmospheric lighting and a beautiful, burnished, applique canopy created by local schoolchildren. The programme is also something of a personal triumph for Birmingham Contemporary Music Group's cellist, Ulrich Heinen, whose detuning and dexterous technique emulates the glides and drone of the surbahar. Heinen's cross-continental virtuosity is employed to best advantage in the opening item, a mesmerising raga by Imrat Kahn, notated for solo cello and tabla. A sublime assimilation of the best of east and west. \u0095 At the Dean Close School, Cheltenham (01242 227979), on Thursday, the Richard Attenborough Centre, Leicester (0116 252 2455), on Saturday, then touring.",
