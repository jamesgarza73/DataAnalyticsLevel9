According to the Institute of Personnel and Development, up to a third of sick days in the UK have nothing to do with genuine ill health. The IPD found that the most common reasons for staying at home were minor complaints such as colds and headaches - although non-manual workers most often stayed off with stress and back pain. The IPD report says sickness absence costs about \u00a3500 per employee per year, a total of \u00a313bn annually. </p> <p> \u0095 <strong>Congratulations</strong> </p> <p>Congratulations to Anna March, 22, named international college-leaver of the year by secretarial recruiter Angela Mortimer at the company's 10th annual conference. March, who studied at Brookside secretarial college in Cambridge, will soon start work as a development assistant at Cambridge's Fitzwilliam college. </p> <p> \u0095<strong>Brainwaves on the beach</strong> </p> <p>New research has concluded that we are at our most creative when on vacation. Holiday firm Thomson has launched a competition to find the most creative \"beach brainwaves\", and one of its holidays is up for grabs. So if you have had any revelations while off work - such as deciding to write that novel, or set up in business on your own - describe them in 200 words, saying where and when you had the idea and how the holiday influenced you. Send your name, age, address and daytime number to Anna Shackleton, Thomson Beach Holiday Brainwaves, Band &amp; Brown Communications, 57a Jamestown Road, Camden, London NW1 7DB, by June 20 2000. </p> <p>\u0095 <strong>Join the dot.coms</strong> </p> <p>What makes some dot.com companies so extraordinarily successful? E-Business Start-up, a new book from Kogan Page, aims to guide the way to your own e-commerce millions. Author Philip Treleaven, professor of computing at University College London, says anyone can become a hi-tech entrepreneur. All you need is a winning idea, total commitment and astute business sense. Copies cost \u00a325 from Kogan Page, tel: 01903 828800. </p> <p> \u0095<strong>Time is Money</strong></p> <p>Mixed news from employment services firm Reed. The continuing recruitment shortage, the company believes, is likely to see secretarial salaries rising more quickly than anticipated. But support staff are having to work ever longer hours to earn them. A Reed survey has found that more than 40% of secretaries work in excess of nine hours a day, while 7% of those in finance companies put in more than 11 hours. Fine if you get decent overtime, but only one in 15 firms offers overtime payments to all staff.</p>",

According to the Institute of Personnel and Development, up to a third of sick days in the UK have nothing to do with genuine ill health. The IPD found that the most common reasons for staying at home were minor complaints such as colds and headaches - although non-manual workers most often stayed off with stress and back pain. The IPD report says sickness absence costs about \u00a3500 per employee per year, a total of \u00a313bn annually. \u0095 Congratulations Congratulations to Anna March, 22, named international college-leaver of the year by secretarial recruiter Angela Mortimer at the company's 10th annual conference. March, who studied at Brookside secretarial college in Cambridge, will soon start work as a development assistant at Cambridge's Fitzwilliam college. \u0095Brainwaves on the beach New research has concluded that we are at our most creative when on vacation. Holiday firm Thomson has launched a competition to find the most creative \"beach brainwaves\", and one of its holidays is up for grabs. So if you have had any revelations while off work - such as deciding to write that novel, or set up in business on your own - describe them in 200 words, saying where and when you had the idea and how the holiday influenced you. Send your name, age, address and daytime number to Anna Shackleton, Thomson Beach Holiday Brainwaves, Band &amp; Brown Communications, 57a Jamestown Road, Camden, London NW1 7DB, by June 20 2000. \u0095 Join the dot.coms What makes some dot.com companies so extraordinarily successful? E-Business Start-up, a new book from Kogan Page, aims to guide the way to your own e-commerce millions. Author Philip Treleaven, professor of computing at University College London, says anyone can become a hi-tech entrepreneur. All you need is a winning idea, total commitment and astute business sense. Copies cost \u00a325 from Kogan Page, tel: 01903 828800. \u0095Time is Money Mixed news from employment services firm Reed. The continuing recruitment shortage, the company believes, is likely to see secretarial salaries rising more quickly than anticipated. But support staff are having to work ever longer hours to earn them. A Reed survey has found that more than 40% of secretaries work in excess of nine hours a day, while 7% of those in finance companies put in more than 11 hours. Fine if you get decent overtime, but only one in 15 firms offers overtime payments to all staff.",

With a big client such as MaxMara, which has five sub-brands in the store, I would always go. With a smaller client, the buyer would do the meeting.

I trust their instincts and creativity. They have a budget, and how they spend it is up to them, but I do sign them off, so I keep tabs on what is going on. We also have strategy meetings that buyers and shopfloor managers attend and I try to ensure everyone has a voice. We discuss what's good, what isn't, and what's to be done.\" </p> <p>Out of that meeting Ross forms an action plan and makes sure that everyone is clear on what points they have to action. \"Clarity is essential. We also have weekly meetings when I communicate any action points that need seeing to, and when the buyers can bring up any concerns.

There will be a strong element of comfort eating about this fare; choccie digestives or oatmeal creams will be favourite and there will often be outbreaks of minor scuffles among staff when the last one is consumed. This company is into instant gratification and is childlike in its pursuit of it. Comfort is the key theme here and any sense of style is almost totally absent. Converse in childlike tones, using phrases like 'ickle problem' and 'weeny spot of overtime'. Pin pics of pets around your PC. Wear cardigans and plaits. </p>",

To impress here you will need to display loyalty and thoroughness. Wear anything in navy or grey, especially from M&amp;S. The status freak Where you spot foil-wrapped or chocolate-coated you will know you are in the embrace of a status-conscious company. Indulge in massive name-dropping sessions on a regular basis and market yourself aggressively and unashamedly. Carry designer bags, preferably Prada. Fruity-tootie Fresh fruit on offer implies the health-conscious slave-master. Low-calorie snacks mean a leaner, meaner fighting workforce with no room for the lard-arsed work shy. This company is trendy and in-your-face. Be seen running up the stairs rather than using the lift, or removing cycle clips each morning in reception. Dress in Gap or Nike. Carry a bottle of designer water at all times. Straight in the vein Some companies bypass all social niceties when offering grub and proffer their biscuits straight from the packet they came in. There will be a strong element of comfort eating about this fare; choccie digestives or oatmeal creams will be favourite and there will often be outbreaks of minor scuffles among staff when the last one is consumed. This company is into instant gratification and is childlike in its pursuit of it. Comfort is the key theme here and any sense of style is almost totally absent. Converse in childlike tones, using phrases like 'ickle problem' and 'weeny spot of overtime'. Pin pics of pets around your PC. Wear cardigans and plaits.",

Not all this technology will be with us in five years. But it will be here soon, with a huge range of similar advances. And according to the Institute of Personnel and Development, it is the roles of secretarial and support staff that are likely to be most affected by technology's great leaps forward. </p> <p>\"Already, IT has changed the secretary's day-to-day life beyond recog nition,\" says Angela Baron, policy adviser to the IPD. Five years ago, she says, many a career secretary had no more computer skills than basic Word for Windows. Today, however, proficiency in Powerpoint, Excel and Access is a must. Often it's just a starting point. </p> <p>According to recruitment consultants Office Angels, the biggest concern for today's PAs is just how much technological know-how is required in the millennial office. \"It's a very grey area,\" admits director of corporate communications, Paul Jacobs. \"Companies are upgrading their technology at hugely varying speeds. Some offer training and some don't. Some use around 2% of the potential of their software, others use more like 50%. Secretaries are, not surprisingly, in a state of confusion.\" </p> <p>Wouldn't it would be nice to have a standard training programme and measurement of computer proficiency? Enter the European Computer Driving Licence (ECDL). This slick little \"passport\" - incorporating collectable stamps declaring your skills in a variety of technological competencies - is set to be the qualification for tomorrow's support staff, according to Pati Gram, training consultant at Kelly Training. \"It's becoming so widely recognised in other countries that it is set to change its name to the International Computer Driving Licence,\" she says. </p> <p>So how does it work? \"It's administered in each country by the primary computer organisation for maintaining standards, and you have three years to complete it,\" says Gram, who believes it may take the place of the two main technological qualifications, Clait and NVQ. \"It has seven main modules, which you can do separately either online or by tutorials at your own pace. Each has an exam and once you have passed them all, any re-cruiter will know you can deal with the future.\" </p> <p>Sanne Bauer, a 20-year-old secretary at Kelly Services' East Grinstead branch, has just passed a module. \"It's a myth that my generation is the computer generation,\" she laughs. \"All the guys hogged the computers at school so I never had any IT training. A lot of employers know this is the case, and that when you say, 'I've got experience of computers,' that could mean anything. This qualification is the perfect solution.\" </p> <p>If you want to be fully equipped for the technological revolution, however, recruitment consultancy Angela Mortimer plc argues you'll also need knowledge of mobile computers - notably \"PDAs\". Personal digital assistants are those sexy personal organisers that you see people showing off on the tube. While they can manage only a fraction of the things a desktop can do, they will still find you a phone number, book an appointment and give you a list of the day's jobs in an instant. They'll also send emails, allow you to download from the internet and set an alarm for that unmissable afternoon meeting. If there's another PDA owner at that meeting, you can beam them information using the infrared service (but beware of beaming abusive messages - the speaker may have a PDA of his own tucked in his pocket.) </p> <p>\"The important factor for secretaries is that you can synchronise all the information from the PDA directly onto the PC,\" explains Janet Alkama, Angela Mortimer's own personal PA. \"That means that even if you don't have one, your boss's PDA will make a huge difference to your role. If, for instance, she makes any amendments to her diary or phone book, she simply hot-syncs it to my PC and so I have a constantly updated version of her movements and contacts.\" The good news is that PDAs are getting cheaper by the month; even better perhaps, formal training is unnecessary. </p> <p>The next step up the technological ladder is the hand-held computer. Not so long ago, these were pocket devices with a keyboard so tiny a leprechaun would have trouble using it. Nowadays they are more like laptops, with many of the same programmes. You may also want to get your head round the WAP phone (a mobile phone with internet access), intranet systems (internal internet systems), digital dictation machines (you talk, they type), digital language converters, and on-line recruitment. </p> <p>\"Support staff have every reason to be excited,\" says Charles Walker of Blue Arrow recruitment services. \"Their role is clearly set to overlap with that of IT staff. In a decade, they'll have an unrivalled range of transferable and up-to-the-minute skills. They'll also have an increasingly high chance of moving across into a purely IT role - something unheard of a couple of years ago.\" </p> <p>But not everyone sees this as a good thing. \"Particularly in smaller companies, there's a good chance that you'll be the only person in the office to have attended an IT course and you might wind up being the IT trouble-shooter without getting paid to be one,\" warns Angela Baron. \"The line between IT staff and support staff may be getting blurred, but the difference in salary certainly isn't.\" </p> <p>And some find the technological stampede itself a little worrying. Dr Mark Brosnan, principal lecturer in psychology at the University of Greenwich, believes that while technology was brought in to make our lives easier, the opposite is happening. \"The job of the office worker who deals with technology is now proven to be one of the most stressful,\" he says. \"There are more things to go wrong, there is more paper rather than less, there is more to do because everything works faster. It's a nightmare.\" </p> <p>It's bad enough, he says, that most of us now have mini-offices at our homes, \"but at least the journey home used to be sacred. Now, with mobile phones and hand held computers, even that time will be expected to be spent working.\" </p> <p>\"I wonder if the role of the secretary will disappear altogether,\" says Sue Andrews, an office administrator at Tesco. \"All these new gadgets advertise themselves as taking over the jobs secretaries and PAs do - perhaps the human versions will become obsolete.\" </p> <p>Certainly much of the new technology could make life easier for many PAs.

Boo's founders insisted at the weekend that the business was beginning to turn around and that it would have succeeded if it had secured the extra investment they wanted. But shareholders are unlikely to recover any of the $120m they sank into the company.",

Anticipating consumer choice is the philosopher's stone of modern business. Get it right and you can turn a base product not exactly into gold, but into a market-leader which is, of course, in the end much the same thing. It is a compelling subject. </p> <p>Malcolm Gladwell's visual metaphor of tipping summons up images of the quantitative graphics used on flipcharts in dire marketing seminars with striplights and plastic cups. It describes that moment in the life of a product, a fashion or an opinion when it ceases to be a minority taste or an unappreciated commercial novelty and, to borrow an expression from an earlier phase of business history, acquires enough critical mass to interest, persuade or infect the majority. </p> <p>'Infect' is not inappropriate: epidemiology, or the study of how diseases spread, has a surprising amount in common with, say, colour forecasting, record-plugging and product planning. </p> <p>If you can understand the dynamics of, say, sexually transmitted diseases (and Gladwell includes a chapter which, perhaps, tells us more than we actually want to know about syphilis in Baltimore), then you have a mathematical and behavioural model about how the activities of a minority can soon influence the rest of us. That is the demand side. From the supply side, the question of anticipating popular desire was handled differently by Harley Earl, chief wizard in the den of kitsch that was General Motors in the Fifties: he told his designers to go as far as they could, then pull back some. That way you lead the public, but not by too much. So we got the two-tone paint and the tail-fin. </p> <p>No one seems certain if the consumer is innately conservative or adventurous. Using material and methods from diffusion studies, Gladwell soon fascinates the reader. Word-of-mouth seems to be the way it always starts: that was how the Volkswagen Beetle, greeted derisively by the US auto industry, took off with the American public in the Fifties. </p> <p>It was the same with an all but dead brand called Hush Puppies in the Nineties. Taken up by a vocal and visible clique (called 'connectors' by Gladwell) a moribund brand became a must-have. Skoda is going through the same process right now. </p> <p>The psychologist Stanley Milgram attempted to understand these mechanisms. In the late Sixties he asked people in Omaha, Nebraska, to send a package to a stockbroker in Sharon, Massachusetts, via the closest intermediary they knew. When the results came through, there were usually no more than seven steps involved in a transcontinental journey from hayseed to preppy. </p> <p>This research gave rise to the expression six degrees of separation which is about as close as most people are. The Tipping Point is full of such interesting stuff. For instance, recent research shows that in the networking cauldron of Hollywood, Elliott Gould was the most connected actor, being only 2.63681 removes from almost anyone else. If you want a market-leading product, get Elliott Gould to endorse your dog food or pantyliner. </p> <p>The locus classicus of how ideas develop in the group mind was Bruce Ryan's and Neal Gross's study of the distribution of hybrid seed corn in Greene County, Iowa, in 1928. This gave us the memorable expression 'early adopters'. The Tipping Point, one senses, is also seeking a methodology and vocabulary that will stick, thus it has some irritating tics, including constant repetition of the tipping or tipped coinage. Gladwell is intelligent, articulate, well-informed and thought-provoking, but in fact and spirit The Tipping Point is really only a long article (which is exactly as it first appeared in the New Yorker). As journalism in hard covers, this book has an ephemeral feel and I doubt it will become a classic, although it's noteworthy that 'tipping point' is already appearing in US newspaper headlines. </p> <p>In the end, it seems persuasion is an art not a science, rather like taste itself. Nietzsche said all life is a question of taste and life is ultimately humane and anarchic: no amount of computer-modelled diffusion studies could have predicted the astonishing ironic revival of, say, Kangol headgear. While it is true that all global phenomena begin with the approval of an enthusiastic minority, it is equally true that there are very many enthusiastic minorities who are still mumbling to themselves.</p>",

It describes that moment in the life of a product, a fashion or an opinion when it ceases to be a minority taste or an unappreciated commercial novelty and, to borrow an expression from an earlier phase of business history, acquires enough critical mass to interest, persuade or infect the majority. 'Infect' is not inappropriate: epidemiology, or the study of how diseases spread, has a surprising amount in common with, say, colour forecasting, record-plugging and product planning. If you can understand the dynamics of, say, sexually transmitted diseases (and Gladwell includes a chapter which, perhaps, tells us more than we actually want to know about syphilis in Baltimore), then you have a mathematical and behavioural model about how the activities of a minority can soon influence the rest of us. That is the demand side. From the supply side, the question of anticipating popular desire was handled differently by Harley Earl, chief wizard in the den of kitsch that was General Motors in the Fifties: he told his designers to go as far as they could, then pull back some. That way you lead the public, but not by too much. So we got the two-tone paint and the tail-fin. No one seems certain if the consumer is innately conservative or adventurous. Using material and methods from diffusion studies, Gladwell soon fascinates the reader. Word-of-mouth seems to be the way it always starts: that was how the Volkswagen Beetle, greeted derisively by the US auto industry, took off with the American public in the Fifties. It was the same with an all but dead brand called Hush Puppies in the Nineties. Taken up by a vocal and visible clique (called 'connectors' by Gladwell) a moribund brand became a must-have. Skoda is going through the same process right now. The psychologist Stanley Milgram attempted to understand these mechanisms. In the late Sixties he asked people in Omaha, Nebraska, to send a package to a stockbroker in Sharon, Massachusetts, via the closest intermediary they knew. When the results came through, there were usually no more than seven steps involved in a transcontinental journey from hayseed to preppy. This research gave rise to the expression six degrees of separation which is about as close as most people are. The Tipping Point is full of such interesting stuff. For instance, recent research shows that in the networking cauldron of Hollywood, Elliott Gould was the most connected actor, being only 2.63681 removes from almost anyone else. If you want a market-leading product, get Elliott Gould to endorse your dog food or pantyliner. The locus classicus of how ideas develop in the group mind was Bruce Ryan's and Neal Gross's study of the distribution of hybrid seed corn in Greene County, Iowa, in 1928. This gave us the memorable expression 'early adopters'. The Tipping Point, one senses, is also seeking a methodology and vocabulary that will stick, thus it has some irritating tics, including constant repetition of the tipping or tipped coinage. Gladwell is intelligent, articulate, well-informed and thought-provoking, but in fact and spirit The Tipping Point is really only a long article (which is exactly as it first appeared in the New Yorker). As journalism in hard covers, this book has an ephemeral feel and I doubt it will become a classic, although it's noteworthy that 'tipping point' is already appearing in US newspaper headlines. In the end, it seems persuasion is an art not a science, rather like taste itself. Nietzsche said all life is a question of taste and life is ultimately humane and anarchic: no amount of computer-modelled diffusion studies could have predicted the astonishing ironic revival of, say, Kangol headgear. While it is true that all global phenomena begin with the approval of an enthusiastic minority, it is equally true that there are very many enthusiastic minorities who are still mumbling to themselves.",

The gallery was inserted into Giles Gilbert Scott's Bankside power station, completed in 1963. The making of the Ca' d'Oro was muddled by the obsessive interference of its owner, the tycoon Marino Contarini. The Tate Modern project was obfuscated by frequent differences of opinion and style between patrons, architects and builders. </p> <p>And just as the story of the opulent Ca' d'Oro encapsulates the condition of Venice in the fifteenth century, so the saga of Tate Modern properly symbolises the conversion of late twentieth-century Britain from splendid insular complacency to aspirant multiculturalism. Karl Sabbagh, who is primarily a television director, has been associated with the project since 1994 and he describes it with an exhausting kind of pride. Well he might, for it is an exhausting history.</p> <p>From start to finish, nothing was easy, hardly anything unanimous. There were objections to the very idea of converting a power station into a gallery of modern art, instead of building a new one. There were criticisms of the choice of architects, the then little-known Swiss firm Herzog and de Meuron. There were the usual environmental concerns, the inevitable tussles of personality, the perennial worries about raising money or satisfying benefactors, arguments about colour, materials, the shape of doors or the size of staircases. Sabbagh ably tells it all, barring no holds and occasionally taking a chance, I nervously thought, on libel. </p> <p>The work took six years. Many of its activists came and went in the course of it, and that handy old American acronym - snafu - constantly entered my mind as I read the book. Now they find unacceptable levels of asbestos in the original structure. Now a supply factory burns to the ground. A hoist fails to work, a lift door won't open. Steel comes late. A pump doesn't turn up. A crane breaks down. The approach to the connecting bridge over the river clashes with plans for the landscaping of the museum. </p> <p>Harry Gugger, one of the architectural partners, complains about the 'terrible' quality of the workmanship, and says it would all be different in Switzerland. Somebody from the Tate talks about 'an incredible sense of a \"wow\" factor'. Someone from a construction company remarks coolly of his clients that 'they come from this arts background'. </p> <p>But all comes more or less right in the end. This is called 'muddling through', as poor Gugger doubtless came to realise. The building was even finished on time and would have made a better millennial monument, to my mind, than the tiresome Dome downstream. Concerned though the Tate people sometimes seem to be, like our political leaders, with the dismissal of everything old, familiar or traditional, the new building is an honourable blend of past and future, industrial and artistic, the powerful and the sensitive, symbolically more proper than any new building Rogers or Foster might have proposed. </p> <p>The hero of the epic is the Tate itself, its staff and, above all, its director, Sir Nicholas Serota.

Lord Northcliffe's biographers have always invited us to choose. The virtue of J. Lee Thompson's studious contribution to Harmsworthiana is that, at least implicitly, he recognises that there are no simple choices. The first great press baron of the modern age may have been gripped by monstrous delusions as his life ended in madness, but he was also a newspaper genius. </p> <p>The facts tell their own cool story. Here's Alfred Harmsworth, first son of an affably unsuccessful barrister, looking for a career. He leaves school at 16 and scratches a freelance living from the Hampstead and Highgate Express. No silver spoons. At 20 (in 1885), he's editor of Bicycling News. Two years on, he's invented his first mass market magazine, Answers, and the road to glory opens before him. A magazine empire floated at 28; the London Evening News bought at 29; the founding of the Daily Mail and Daily Mirror; the purchase of The Observer and the Times; the youngest peer ever created, at 40. He had a blinding talent for innovation. Essentially, he invented our national press. </p> <p>When he went to New York in 1901, Joseph Pulitzer of the World (and the prize) challenged him to produce the 'newspaper of the future'. He did it alone in a handful of days; a tabloid offering of 'All the News in 60 Seconds', which brilliantly encapsulated all the trends of the century to come. Genius. </p> <p>Where, though, is the man who Hugh Cudlipp once described as the desecrator of good journalism in 'his pursuit of political power unguided by political prescience?' He is here, too; Thompson portrays him whole - not as some Citizen Kane, but as a thoughtful stripling whose philosophy 'combined Tory populism, Disraelian imperialism and a firm belief in the \"Anglo-Saxon future\",' which is a pretty fair take on even today's Daily Mail. </p> <p>Politics intrigued him, to be sure, yet he also, at least in the beginning, knew where the lines of freedom and influence should be drawn. He appointed Garvin to The Observer and when, at last, the two fell out over imperial preference, he sold the paper on to Waldorf Astor, rather than sack his editor. His guarantees of independence for the Times lasted longer than many expected and fractured, at the close, as much on its dozy lack of new editorial thinking as any single issue of politics. </p> <p>Northcliffe, to be fair, was originally no manic seeker of power. Rather, the politicians, seeing the influence his papers had begun to wield, crawled to him, just as their ancestors flock to pay court to Rupert Murdoch. And he was by no means always wrong. He was right to see the dangers of war with Germany and right again to flay the inert prosecution of that dreadful conflict once it came. His sense of country and service to it was strong. </p> <p>He was also, in his way, a casualty of war. We all know - from the Falklands to the Gulf - how battlefields tear up the rulebooks of decent journalism, how Whitehall twists in the 'national interest'; by that time, Northcliffe was an insider as well as an outsider. His own rulebooks went missing in action. But he was never an armchair critic. Sickly, exhausted, he'd still go to the fronts of France to see and learn for himself. The dementia at the close was a cruel line drawn under this life. </p> <p>Lee Thompson's account is by no means all-embracing. He leaves out the private Northcliffe (and tiptoes away from the family moralist who fathered three kids by a mistress). There's no clue (the Times aside) how Northcliffe picked the teams of editors and reporters who made his papers. Too many chapters consist of little more than history lessons with quotes from Mail leaders as commentaries. (What did Northcliffe write himself? How did his empire survive his interminable holidays of recuperation?) Nevertheless, the bones for judgment are here, and, with them, one inexorable conundrum: how do we want our newspapers owned? What are proprietors supposed to do? </p> <p>There's no single answer to that, but it's necessary to say that without Harmsworth, many newspapers of today would never have existed. He knew instinctively where the readers of the twentieth century were. He reached out to them, included them in the debate. Was he supposed, after that, to sit vapidly to one side? Human impossibility. You bought the whole package, and you did, in your millions, buy.</p>",

Where, though, is the man who Hugh Cudlipp once described as the desecrator of good journalism in 'his pursuit of political power unguided by political prescience?' He is here, too; Thompson portrays him whole - not as some Citizen Kane, but as a thoughtful stripling whose philosophy 'combined Tory populism, Disraelian imperialism and a firm belief in the \"Anglo-Saxon future\",' which is a pretty fair take on even today's Daily Mail. Politics intrigued him, to be sure, yet he also, at least in the beginning, knew where the lines of freedom and influence should be drawn. He appointed Garvin to The Observer and when, at last, the two fell out over imperial preference, he sold the paper on to Waldorf Astor, rather than sack his editor. His guarantees of independence for the Times lasted longer than many expected and fractured, at the close, as much on its dozy lack of new editorial thinking as any single issue of politics. Northcliffe, to be fair, was originally no manic seeker of power. Rather, the politicians, seeing the influence his papers had begun to wield, crawled to him, just as their ancestors flock to pay court to Rupert Murdoch. And he was by no means always wrong. He was right to see the dangers of war with Germany and right again to flay the inert prosecution of that dreadful conflict once it came. His sense of country and service to it was strong. He was also, in his way, a casualty of war. We all know - from the Falklands to the Gulf - how battlefields tear up the rulebooks of decent journalism, how Whitehall twists in the 'national interest'; by that time, Northcliffe was an insider as well as an outsider. His own rulebooks went missing in action. But he was never an armchair critic. Sickly, exhausted, he'd still go to the fronts of France to see and learn for himself. The dementia at the close was a cruel line drawn under this life. Lee Thompson's account is by no means all-embracing. He leaves out the private Northcliffe (and tiptoes away from the family moralist who fathered three kids by a mistress). There's no clue (the Times aside) how Northcliffe picked the teams of editors and reporters who made his papers. Too many chapters consist of little more than history lessons with quotes from Mail leaders as commentaries. (What did Northcliffe write himself? How did his empire survive his interminable holidays of recuperation?) Nevertheless, the bones for judgment are here, and, with them, one inexorable conundrum: how do we want our newspapers owned? What are proprietors supposed to do? There's no single answer to that, but it's necessary to say that without Harmsworth, many newspapers of today would never have existed. He knew instinctively where the readers of the twentieth century were. He reached out to them, included them in the debate. Was he supposed, after that, to sit vapidly to one side? Human impossibility. You bought the whole package, and you did, in your millions, buy.",

We are on a ship with Caryl Phillips, a 'banana' boat carrying cargo to the white cliffs of Dover. It is a functional vessel with none of the frills of proper passenger liners. Like Jonathan Raban and the early V.S. Naipaul, Phillips can do truly live reportage. You don't sit back and merely empathise with what is going on.

They had undertaken that 'long, arduous journey which had brought them from one world and placed them in the heart of another'.

We go on heartbreaking journeys to Africa, to India and Pakistan to make sense of who we are. We walk in English graveyards and pore over old books seeking lost stories. We are all struggling with the pain of doctored narratives, ancestral links, of ownership and rights and of living in a country which remains determined not to know the grim realities of its murky history. </p> <p>Phillips is one of the most tenacious of these excavators and in this book his intense focus is on the Atlantic slave trade. The three main sections of the book are based in Liverpool, Elmina in Ghana and Charleston, US - three cities which were central to this horrendous trade. Fact is fleshed out with the fictional imagination; today calls out insistently to yesterday; everyday observations shed light on stories of heroism and betrayal. </p> <p>First we get the story of a Christian African, John Emmanual Ocansey who comes over to Liverpool in 1881, looking for the white English gentleman who cheated his family of money under the pretence of fair trade. He heads back home with tears in his eyes. Centuries on, Phillips arrives looking for truth and is as disappointed. Waiting at Liverpool station, he observes: 'A train pulls in and I can hear the uncivilised braying of football fans readying themselves for a Saturday afternoon of revelry. I am glad I am leaving. It's disquieting to be in a place where history is so physically present, yet so glaringly absent from people's consciousness.' </p> <p>Ghana, too, is exposed to these ruthless eyes which refuse to look away. Phillips wants to know if Africans teach their children that some of their own were implicated in the slave trade. A Ghanaian professor warns him: 'You must not be too romantic about slavery. It was a terrible thing, but I still maintain that many of the Africans who left here were not good people... in some respects they got what they deserved.' </p> <p>My problem with Phillips is that he is always too controlled.

      "body": "<p>On a university campus just outside Boston, on a summer's day six years ago, the Argentine players were getting ready for the World Cup by playing a scratch game among themselves. So good was the mood that Diego Maradona stopped giving interviews and joined in. Every goal at either end was cheered by hundreds of rich Argentines studying in Boston. </p> <p>Yet it was quiet enough to hear the players shouting. And the word they shouted most often was 'Flaco!' </p> <p>None of the Argentine players was named Flaco, but in Latin America you only become a real person once you acquire a nickname, and 'Flaco' - 'Thin One' - was the sobriquet of Fernando Redondo. </p> <p>The reason everyone kept screaming it was that Redondo always seemed to have the ball. In this brilliant team, which but for a cocktail of ephedrine would have won the World Cup, all attacks ran through the long-haired, hippie-like figure at the back of midfield. So they do at Real Madrid, the team that on Wednesday night plays Valencia for the Champions League. </p> <p>Real's chances depend largely on El Flaco (or The Prince, or The White Machine). At his best he can destroy Manchester United. At his worst, he infuriates Johan Cruyff. And whether Redondo will be at his best depends largely on his team. Real Madrid have just overcome United and Bayern Munich, but a year ago, with much the same team, in the Spanish Cup semi-finals, they lost 6-0 to Valencia. 'San Marino, you are like San Marino,' sang the Valencia fans. So which Flaco and which Real will we get? </p> <p>Redondo was born 30 years ago in Adrogu\u00e9 in Buenos Aires. It is common to say of any Latin American footballer that the game helped him escape from the slums. This is not true of Redondo. A middle-class boy, he was studying law when Carlos Bilardo, then the Argentine manager, called him up for some friendlies before the World Cup of 1990. </p> <p>Redondo turned him down, saying he had to sit exams. The truth is more complex. There are two basic types of Argentine coaches: those such as Bilardo and Daniel Passarella, who think football is about breaking legs, diving for penalties and punching goals, and those such as Jorge Valdano, Cesar Luis Menotti and the current Argentine manager, Marcelo Bielsa, who think there is more to it. The latter tend to be educated men who compare football with poetry, music and countless other art forms. </p> <p>The Bilardistas are generally on the political right: Passarella captained the Argentine side that won the 1978 World Cup under the military regime. The Menottistas are mostly left-wingers. </p> <p>Redondo, an educated man of the left, is with the Menottistas. This is more than a matter of academic interest: it has shaped his career, and explains why he is at Real. After rejecting Bilardo, he moved to Europe to play for Tenerife, where his manager was Valdano. It was Valdano who brought him to Real Madrid in 1994, and it was Bielsa who recalled him to the Argentine side. </p> <p>Before the last World Cup Passarella had kicked Redondo out of the Argentine team. Famously, Redondo had ignored Passarella's edict to cut his hair. In fact, the hair was merely the excuse. The dispute went deeper: Passarella wanted Redondo to consider himself a soldier in his army. Redondo would not. </p> <p>Passarella ended up looking silly. Argentina went out of the World Cup in the quarter-finals, weeks after Redondo had helped Real Madrid win the Champions League. </p> <p>At Real, Redondo has won everything: two league titles and the World Club Cup, as well as the 'septima', the club's seventh European Cup. Yet it would be wrong to say that he has had six glorious years. Real are a crazy club, led by a president with a three-second attention-span, and Redondo has often been dragged down with the rest. </p> <p>This year Real have climbed out of the bottom half of the Spanish league but never got a whiff of the title. Their home defat on Friday means they have finished fifth and must win on Wednesday to return to next season's Champions League. 'Real Madrid have been playing fairly badly to very badly all year,' said Johan Cruyff in March. 'I don't think there is a team in the world where the midfield loses so many balls. You can't count how many Redondo loses.' </p> <p>Redondo is often called the master of the one-touch. 'Tactically perfect,' said his former coach Fabio Capello. But when his team-mates are not moving, he can appear helpless. He lacks acceleration, is often carrying injuries, and sometimes seems not to care. Then he becomes the master of the two or three-touch, passing needlessly to defenders, slowing the game down. </p> <p>Real have continued to falter, but this spring they have at least played well in the big games. A month ago they saved their season by beating Manchester United 3-2 at Old Trafford, chiefly thanks to Redondo. Playing further forward than usual, he also produced the moment of this year's Champions League. </p> <p>First, it must be said that humiliating United's Henning Berg is a realistic proposition. It has been done before, usually by Berg himself. But Redondo defined the art. Sprinting with Berg to the goalline, he back-heeled the ball through the Norwegian's legs, collected it and passed to Ra\u00fal who scored Real's third goal. Later Rinus Michels, the authoritarian former manager of Holland, was asked about that back-heel. Surely he would never have tolerated it? 'That boy,' said Michels, 'would never have heard anything about it from me.' </p> <p>Alex Ferguson noted that all loose balls that night had seemed to fall to Redondo. 'What does this player have in his boots?' Ferguson asked. 'A magnet?' Redondo is indeed more than a playmaker - at his best, he hoovers the midfield. </p> <p>United escaped lightly. In the semi-finals Redondo and Ra\u00fal deliberately humiliated Bayern Munich. At times the two had fun simply passing to each other, making jokes about Carsten Jancker as the huge striker lumbered after the ball. More than once Redondo showed the ball to Bayern's Stefan Effenberg, waited for Effenberg to pounce, and then rolled it to a team-mate. </p> <p>The Germans also sulked about a particularly frivolous bicycle-kick by Roberto Carlos. This, they felt, was bad manners. </p> <p>In this Real side, Redondo and Ra\u00fal - perhaps the two key players - are best mates. Both like their peace before games. In the next few days, while his colleague Steve McManaman whiles away the time watching films and Nicolas Anelka and Geremi are busy on their Playstations, Redondo and Ra\u00fal will be reading bound volumes of paper known as books. The Thin One enjoys Jorge Luis Borges, Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez and Italian fashion magazines. </p> <p>Wednesday could be Redondo's day: Anelka, Ra\u00fal and Fernando Morientes are exactly the quick forwards he needs. Alternatively, Valencia could win 6-0 again.</p>",

At times the two had fun simply passing to each other, making jokes about Carsten Jancker as the huge striker lumbered after the ball. More than once Redondo showed the ball to Bayern's Stefan Effenberg, waited for Effenberg to pounce, and then rolled it to a team-mate. The Germans also sulked about a particularly frivolous bicycle-kick by Roberto Carlos. This, they felt, was bad manners. In this Real side, Redondo and Ra\u00fal - perhaps the two key players - are best mates. Both like their peace before games. In the next few days, while his colleague Steve McManaman whiles away the time watching films and Nicolas Anelka and Geremi are busy on their Playstations, Redondo and Ra\u00fal will be reading bound volumes of paper known as books. The Thin One enjoys Jorge Luis Borges, Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez and Italian fashion magazines. Wednesday could be Redondo's day: Anelka, Ra\u00fal and Fernando Morientes are exactly the quick forwards he needs. Alternatively, Valencia could win 6-0 again.",

At least, unlike Glenn Hoddle, he had stopped coaching the national team before telling us the 'inside story'. </p> <p>Predictably there are one or two spicy bits that attract attention. In Illingworth's book the focus was often Devon Malcolm; in Lloyd's we learn that Graham Thorpe was 'surly', and Andrew Caddick was regarded as a 'nerd' - assessments that may provoke some new nicknames in the England dressing room. This creates the odd headline; sales increase while Lloyd protests in countless interviews that these observations are taken out of context; for a week or so one or two players are miffed and then life goes on. </p> <p>In fact Lloyd's book is rather more balanced than the headlines suggest. Thorpe may be surly but is also 'one of our box-office players'. Caddick, we finally learn, is 'a grand lad; we get along great, but he does put his big, clumsy foot in it now and again' - titbits that don't make great headlines. Lloyd's strongest criticisms are aimed not at the players but at the ECB and in particular Tim Lamb, with whom he clearly had a frosty relationship. Lloyd is forever summoned to his study, feeling like a naughty schoolboy. </p> <p>'They seemed to want a paperwork mountain and a nanny state,' says Lloyd about the ECB. This is a valid warning signal. The ECB has mushroomed in size in recent years, employing almost as many people as all the other cricketing boards put together. Centralisation of everything seems to be the goal and it is always worth asking whether this is: a) necessary, and b) affordable. </p> <p>Lloyd also recalls England's infamous little tour to Zimbabwe, a trip that soon established that 'my honeymoon in the job was well and truly over... to my detractors Zimbabwe will always be a rope to hang me with'. This may explain why he devotes so much space to that tour, detailing the poor accommodation, sub-standard practice facilities and the lack of cooperation from the hosts. All these protestations seem a little hollow at the moment. </p> <p>Here in England we have the Zimbabwean cricket team; back home their country is in disarray so that the players must be constantly anxious about the welfare of their families. Their cricketers are being rewarded with the princely sum of \u00a33,000 for their three-month trip to England and since inflation is so rampant in Zimbabwe that figure might be reduced, in real terms, by 15 per cent by the time they return. And key players are absent through injury. Yet we have not heard one jot of self-pity from their squad, who are determinedly soldiering on when everything - including the toss - is against them. In this context the protestations about all the hardships that had to be endured in Zimbabwe three years ago still seem insufficient to justify the surly demeanour and the poor performances of that England touring team. </p> <p>Lloyd, for all his virtues - his boundless enthusiasm and his determination to give his players every possible prop, whether they be psychologists, bowling coaches or bonding weekends halfway up a Welsh mountain - occasionally lost his sense of perspective. His successor, the measured Duncan Fletcher, is unlikely to fall into the same trap.

That was the time of my early morning run, but on Thursday it was a case of checking for cloud cover. There wasn't a cloud to be seen. </p> <p>I felt there was a chance that I wouldn't be picked, but still had to prepare myself for five to eleven as though I was definitely in the team. My routine involves visualising what I intend doing: fluent run-up, pitch it on leg and hit the top of off with a good follow-through. Simple, really. </p> <p>The clouds duly arrived and at 9.38am I was told I was in, which was a great moment. </p> <p>At the Oval last year, I was far more nervous than I thought I would be, and I think that adversely affected my performance. This time around I was extremely calm and confident. I keep harping on about the mental side of the game, but it is incredibly important. I have not spoken to any of the other guys about nerves, but feel I've conquered that little problem. </p> <p>It has to be said that Nasser Hussain is a top tosser. He has won seven out of nine as captain of England and we were all delighted to put the Zimbabweans in. Andy Caddick got us off to a great start with those three quick wickets bowling into the wind, and then I took over from him. </p> <p>Andy Flower edged my fourth ball to Michael Atherton at slip and I was off and running. Whittall played on, Streak got an edge, Ramps took a sharp catch to get rid of Strang and, finally, Johnson skied one to Darren Gough, who had a little juggle before giving me my fifth wicket. </p> <p>In the England dressing room is an honours board with the names of all those who have taken a 'Pfeiffer' - five for, geddit? - for England in a Lord's Test. I'm thrilled that my name is going to be up there with the greats of the past 120 years. In fact, 'ESH Giddins 5-15' is up there already, courtesy of Alec Stewart, some tape and his daughter's stencil. </p> <p>The back-slapping started almost immediately. The team have been great and I got some good-natured ribbing from the other bowlers. Duncan Fletcher has been fantastic, and I got a message along the lines 'Well bowled, you creep' from Bob Woolmer. The Warwickshire boys have all left messages on my phone, most of which have been incredibly rude. There is another reason for their enthusiasm. I think they feel that my performance may keep me away from Warwickshire for a while. </p> <p>My family were there as well, which was special, and I think they have been in the pub for the past couple of days as they tend to get a little overexcited. </p> <p>One bloke who really deserves my thanks is Matt Asquith. He was my personal instructor at Lilleshall over the winter and he kept me going. At six o'clock on a freezing December morning, it is very tempting to turn up the radiator and go back to sleep, but Matt always coaxed me out of bed for a run. He was always encouraging during the tough times - and there were several - and has become a good friend. </p> <p>It's difficult to know how I feel about what has happened. I haven't looked at the papers yet, although I gather a fair bit has been written. It seems strange, but I can't get too excited. I'm very aware that the next time I get the ball in my hand I might go wicketless and get carted for 150, and everything would be forgotten. </p> <p>This game has seen me achieve my highest score in a Test with the bat - a sparkling five-ball seven. Goughie did a great job yesterday evening and now we want to get the job finished as quickly as possible. </p> <p>I've always had huge self-belief and I'm more determined than ever to go out there and do it again.</p>",

'As a member, I shudder at the state of Hampshire. They thought Shane Warne would change it, but it doesn't work like that. County cricket is an appallingly low standard.

Hurtling in from the Pavilion End, he overwhelmed four Zimbabwean batsmen, through pace and devilish swing, leaving the tourists in an utterly hopeless position unless there are now two days of uninterrupted rain. Faced with a first innings deficit of 332, Zimbabwe are 39 for five. </p> <p>Unlike Thursday, when Gough was the sole wayward English bowler, he was bang on target from the start. And he was fast. After each delivery he glanced not so surreptitiously at the 'speedster' on the boundary's edge. It always registered between 87 and 90 mph - too fast for the tourists' upper order. For an hour, Lord's was the Yorkshire imp's playground and the Zimbabweans were out of their depth. </p> <p>Grant Flower was stuck on the crease and palpably lbw in Gough's first over.

      "bodyText": "A fearsome late-evening burst from Darren Gough, the least likely of the English bowlers in the first innings, multiplied the torment of the Zimbabweans on their nightmarish first appearance in a Test match at Lord's. Hurtling in from the Pavilion End, he overwhelmed four Zimbabwean batsmen, through pace and devilish swing, leaving the tourists in an utterly hopeless position unless there are now two days of uninterrupted rain. Faced with a first innings deficit of 332, Zimbabwe are 39 for five. Unlike Thursday, when Gough was the sole wayward English bowler, he was bang on target from the start. And he was fast. After each delivery he glanced not so surreptitiously at the 'speedster' on the boundary's edge. It always registered between 87 and 90 mph - too fast for the tourists' upper order. For an hour, Lord's was the Yorkshire imp's playground and the Zimbabweans were out of their depth. Grant Flower was stuck on the crease and palpably lbw in Gough's first over. Then Trevor Gripper edged to Nick Knight at third slip, and the validity of the catch was referred to the third umpire just as it had been in the morning when Stewart gloved the ball to Andy Flower.

      "body": "<p>Simon Craske used to advise Ministers at the Department of Trade and Industry on the minutiae of trade policy. But, convinced he had something more to offer society, Craske gave up his high-powered civil service job three years ago to retrain as a psychiatric nurse. Next September he will qualify. </p> <p>Craske, 34, is determined to live and work as a nurse in London, but he doesn't think his fellow students will be able to do the same. Most will leave the capital, he said. </p> <p>'On our salaries there's no way we can afford a home. We're in an area of health which isn't sexy. I don't think I'll ever be able to buy a house near my work.' </p> <p>Craske's gloomy prognosis is part of a wider malaise which is gathering momentum. All over London and the South-east, nurses, teachers, policemen and other essential workers are simply priced out of the property market. Their answer is to up sticks and leave the South-east behind. </p> <p>No conclusive research has so far been commissioned detailing the region's recruitment shortages in vital services, but anecdotal evidence paints a grim picture. </p> <p>A Police Federation spokeswoman said that following the abolition of officers' housing allowances in 1994, the forces in and around London have 'real difficulties' filling the ranks. </p> <p>'For every three people who leave the Met, only two are recruited. We can't recruit older, maturer people with more life experience. There are officers in the South-east living on family credit and taking second jobs,' she said. </p> <p>A National Union of Teachers' spokeswoman remarked last week: 'Newly qualified teachers earn \u00a316,050 a year. On that salary, you'd be lucky to afford a semi-detached toilet in London.' </p> <p>Health campaigners say there are 5,000 nursing vacancies in the capital. This cannot be unconnected to the fact that medical staff are increasingly forced to find homes in the expensive private rental sector, rather than have the NHS supply digs. </p> <p>The reason is that often hospitals funded by the Private Finance Initiative or run by trusts have to raise money by selling off to developers land and homes previously earmarked for staff. </p> <p>Greenwich Healthcare Trust used to supply 387 homes for staff at Greenwich District General in South-east London. Next year, it is moving into an old military hospital in nearby Woolwich. The trust says it can only supply its minimum statutory requirement: just 97 homes, with 70 reserved for doctors. </p> <p>Key workers were to be have been found homes through an arrangement with a housing association. This deal fell through. Now the trust is relying on its local borough and the private rented sector to take them in. </p> <p>In five years, the average price of an inner London house has almost doubled from \u00a372,582 to \u00a3140,148, according to Nationwide Building Society figures. But the provision of social - now rebranded as 'affordable' - housing, has dwindled. </p> <p>In 1985, before council house tenants had the right to buy their homes, Britain had six million council and housing association homes. Today, according to the Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions, there are only 3.5 million. </p> <p>Council house sales in 15 years have totalled 1.5 million. Recently, says DETR, there has been a flurry of sales, as tenants take advantage of generous sales discounts at a time when the housing market is frothing. </p> <p>The Government is concerned about the growing crisis affecting key workers. Last month Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott, who runs the DETR, published the first Housing Green Paper in 23 years. </p> <p>Its wide-ranging proposals could mark the biggest change in affordable housing for 40 years. They include transferring council houses to new social companies which, unlike local authorities, will be able to borrow money on the open market, using tenants' rents as secu rity for loans. The move will free up the councils to take a more strategic view of housing and regneration. </p> <p>For key workers, Prescott wants to set up a Starter Home Initiative, which would subsidise the purchase of homes by those living in areas where 'house price affordability is a significant problem'. </p> <p>At this stage, the DETR admits that the plan is sketchy. It is inviting mortgage providers and housing associations to come up with funding models. Plans being discussed include interest-free mortgage loans and 70 per cent mortages with loans covering the rest of the house price, redeemable once a property has been sold on. </p> <p>For the Starter Home Initiative to have a real impact, mortgage providers and housing experts say the subsidies would have to be huge. 'Someone is going to have to foot the bill for higher costs in the South-east,' said one lender. There are no definitions of who exactly is a key worker.

      "bodyText": "Simon Craske used to advise Ministers at the Department of Trade and Industry on the minutiae of trade policy. But, convinced he had something more to offer society, Craske gave up his high-powered civil service job three years ago to retrain as a psychiatric nurse. Next September he will qualify. Craske, 34, is determined to live and work as a nurse in London, but he doesn't think his fellow students will be able to do the same. Most will leave the capital, he said. 'On our salaries there's no way we can afford a home. We're in an area of health which isn't sexy. I don't think I'll ever be able to buy a house near my work.' Craske's gloomy prognosis is part of a wider malaise which is gathering momentum. All over London and the South-east, nurses, teachers, policemen and other essential workers are simply priced out of the property market. Their answer is to up sticks and leave the South-east behind. No conclusive research has so far been commissioned detailing the region's recruitment shortages in vital services, but anecdotal evidence paints a grim picture. A Police Federation spokeswoman said that following the abolition of officers' housing allowances in 1994, the forces in and around London have 'real difficulties' filling the ranks. 'For every three people who leave the Met, only two are recruited. We can't recruit older, maturer people with more life experience. There are officers in the South-east living on family credit and taking second jobs,' she said. A National Union of Teachers' spokeswoman remarked last week: 'Newly qualified teachers earn \u00a316,050 a year. On that salary, you'd be lucky to afford a semi-detached toilet in London.' Health campaigners say there are 5,000 nursing vacancies in the capital. This cannot be unconnected to the fact that medical staff are increasingly forced to find homes in the expensive private rental sector, rather than have the NHS supply digs. The reason is that often hospitals funded by the Private Finance Initiative or run by trusts have to raise money by selling off to developers land and homes previously earmarked for staff. Greenwich Healthcare Trust used to supply 387 homes for staff at Greenwich District General in South-east London. Next year, it is moving into an old military hospital in nearby Woolwich. The trust says it can only supply its minimum statutory requirement: just 97 homes, with 70 reserved for doctors. Key workers were to be have been found homes through an arrangement with a housing association. This deal fell through. Now the trust is relying on its local borough and the private rented sector to take them in. In five years, the average price of an inner London house has almost doubled from \u00a372,582 to \u00a3140,148, according to Nationwide Building Society figures. But the provision of social - now rebranded as 'affordable' - housing, has dwindled. In 1985, before council house tenants had the right to buy their homes, Britain had six million council and housing association homes. Today, according to the Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions, there are only 3.5 million. Council house sales in 15 years have totalled 1.5 million. Recently, says DETR, there has been a flurry of sales, as tenants take advantage of generous sales discounts at a time when the housing market is frothing. The Government is concerned about the growing crisis affecting key workers. Last month Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott, who runs the DETR, published the first Housing Green Paper in 23 years. Its wide-ranging proposals could mark the biggest change in affordable housing for 40 years. They include transferring council houses to new social companies which, unlike local authorities, will be able to borrow money on the open market, using tenants' rents as secu rity for loans. The move will free up the councils to take a more strategic view of housing and regneration. For key workers, Prescott wants to set up a Starter Home Initiative, which would subsidise the purchase of homes by those living in areas where 'house price affordability is a significant problem'. At this stage, the DETR admits that the plan is sketchy. It is inviting mortgage providers and housing associations to come up with funding models. Plans being discussed include interest-free mortgage loans and 70 per cent mortages with loans covering the rest of the house price, redeemable once a property has been sold on. For the Starter Home Initiative to have a real impact, mortgage providers and housing experts say the subsidies would have to be huge. 'Someone is going to have to foot the bill for higher costs in the South-east,' said one lender. There are no definitions of who exactly is a key worker. Are hospital porters, firemen and catering staff going to get assistance?' But Alan Cherry, chairman of housebuilding firm Countryside Properties and a member of Lord Rogers' Urban Task Force, said: 'You have to recognise that at least 25 per cent of us cannot afford to buy their own house after so many years of house price growth. When I think back, I was heavily subsidised when I bought homes. Mortgage Interest Tax Relief [now abolished] was a device to get people to buy property. No one complained too much then.'

Planned spending will go up by \u00a3900m on last year's total, to \u00a36.7bn. But Shelter, the charity for the homeless, wants that subsidy to double. In a report published last week, it warned that 'if these pressures are not tackled, more people will live in overcrowded, miserable homes.' It is likely that some money will be found for a Starter Home Initiative. But it is expected to be limited. Meanwhile, housing experts believe the British obsession with home ownership should be tempered. A recent survey said 68 per cent of Britons own their homes, and 90 per cent aspire to do so. These days, there is a discernible energy emanating from housing associations and registered social landlords.

In Hackney, east London, the once-notorious Holly Street estate, home to more than 3,000 people, has been transformed from an unforbidding series of 'snake and tower' blocks into a mixed- tenure neighbourhood where parents are not afraid to let their children play outside. It is the result of a public-private partnership between the local council, the Housing Corporation and private finance from Laing Homes.

But for a new age of affordable housing to begin, the Chancellor will have to show a willingness to release more cash in July. The midwife Penny Bart, 27, is a language graduate now training to become a midwife at Greenwich District General, London.

Strangely, he was never in the national team reckoning when he was playing in his own country. <br><strong> Emerson (Portuguesa)</strong> Age 25, 0 caps <br>he latest uncapped central defender to be picked as Luxemburgo continues his search to end Brazil's vulnerability in this position. <br></p> <p> <strong> Midfielders</strong> <br><strong> Cesar Sampaio (Palmeiras)</strong> Age 32, 40 caps<br> Ever present in the World Cup two years ago, he was left in the lurch by Luxemburgo until being picked to face Ecuador last month. <br><strong> Flavio Conceicao (Deportivo La Coruna)</strong> Age 25, 37 caps <br>Defensive midfielder with a powerful shot, his efforts in the Spanish league have been rewarded with only his second recall since injury cost him a place in the World Cup two years ago. <br><strong> Emerson (Bayer Leverkusen)</strong> Age 24, 26 caps <br>Dunga's successor is seen by his club coach as the perfect example of a modern player.

He is certainly never afraid to foul the opposition but he also has a good goalscoring record at international level. <br><strong> Ze Roberto (Bayer Leverkusen)</strong> Age 25, 35 caps <br>Has kept his place in the squad despite criticism of his performances in Brazil's two World Cup qualifiers. Nippy and skillful but not really effective at international level.

He gives plenty of support to those who see South Americans as born divers.<br> <strong> Elber (Bayern Munich)</strong> Age 27, 11 caps <br>His exploits for the Bavarian club seem to weigh more heavily than his performances for his country when Luxemburgo picks his squad. Elber has rarely impressed at international level and certainly lacks the spark of players such as Romario and Edmundo. <br><strong> Franca (Sao Paulo)</strong> Age 24, 0 caps <br>Has earned what many, including himself, see as a belated call up after some prolific scoring for his club. <br><strong> Romario (Vasco)</strong> Age 34, 62 caps <br>Has looked as sharp as ever this year, yet has still to play a full international under Luxemburgo. He was excluded from last year's Copa America squad for declaring: 'I want to win another title.' Luxemburgo's reply was: 'A player who conjugates a verb in the first person singular cannot be part of the squad. He has to conjugate the verb in the first person plural. We. We want to conquer. We are going to conquer...' <br></p>",

Rivaldo (Barcelona) Age 28, 39 caps The world's number one saved Brazil from humiliation last month when he scored a quick equaliser after they had fallen behind to Ecuador in a World Cup qualifier. He has the full confidence of Luxemburgo, his mentor when the pair were at Palmeiras in the mid-Nineties. Forwards Amoroso (Parma) Age 24, 12 caps. One of Luxemburgo's preferred strikers, though injury has hampered his career throughout. He gives plenty of support to those who see South Americans as born divers. Elber (Bayern Munich) Age 27, 11 caps His exploits for the Bavarian club seem to weigh more heavily than his performances for his country when Luxemburgo picks his squad. Elber has rarely impressed at international level and certainly lacks the spark of players such as Romario and Edmundo. Franca (Sao Paulo) Age 24, 0 caps Has earned what many, including himself, see as a belated call up after some prolific scoring for his club. Romario (Vasco) Age 34, 62 caps Has looked as sharp as ever this year, yet has still to play a full international under Luxemburgo. He was excluded from last year's Copa America squad for declaring: 'I want to win another title.' Luxemburgo's reply was: 'A player who conjugates a verb in the first person singular cannot be part of the squad. He has to conjugate the verb in the first person plural. We. We want to conquer. We are going to conquer...'",

This one took 72 minutes longer to arrive, but was no less welcome. Another half-hour would have tried everybody's patience, and the prospect of another penalty shoot-out between an English side and a foreign one was too awful to contemplate. </p> <p>The result was a fair one, too. Aston Villa managed to contain Chelsea's illustrious attack for half the game, but hardly threatened going forward. John Gregory's players had gone into a huddle before kick-off, perhaps for a discussion about where their goals might come from, for though David James is sure to take some blame for his part in the goal, the bluntness of Villa's attack was just as big a factor in the final outcome. 'We didn't do enough in the final third, but that's been the story of our season,' Gregory said. </p> <p>Villa actually enjoyed the better of one of Wembley's more mundane opening half-hours, managing to keep Chelsea pinned back in their own half even if the sum total of their early pressure amounted to a couple of well-flighted free-kicks and an optimistic shot over the bar from Paul Merson. </p> <p>Dennis Wise brought the first save of the game when he volleyed straight at James from the edge of the area in the ninth minute, but though George Weah showed a couple of clever touches, he and the equally isolated Gianfranco Zola were mere spectators to most of the first-half action. Gianluca Vialli had preferred Zola to Tore Andre Flo, and after paying \u00a310m for Chris Sutton at the start of the season Vialli couldn't even find a place for him on the bench. </p> <p>It was one of those games that needed something unexpected to liven it up, yet nothing short of a bomb or the early arrival of Wembley's demolition men appeared likely to shake the players out of their torpor. Even the bookings were niggly non-events. Gareth Barry and Mario Melchiot, a late replacement for the injured Albert Ferrer, collected cautions after tit-for-tat fouls on each other midway through the first half, and Wise in one of his more mischievous moods was correctly pulled up by referee Graham Poll for a sneaky attack on George Boateng's ankles. </p> <p>The first half's most entertaining event, by far, came right at the end, when Dion Dublin, perhaps frustrated by winning so many aerial challenges and seeing so little come from the knock-downs, hurled Frank Leboeuf to the ground by the scruff of the neck as he shepherded the ball in his own area. Surprisingly, neither the referee nor his linesman saw anything wrong with the blatant shove, and somewhat less surprisingly, there was little sympathy from the crowd when the Frenchman stayed on the ground theatrically clutching a hamstring. </p> <p>Leboeuf reappeared for the second half, which, by the time it was 10 minutes old, had provided more incident and entertainment than the entire first half. First Gareth Southgate headed over from Merson's cross, then Zola found Weah at the other end for the Liberian to produce a shot on the turn that flew a foot wide of the right post. </p> <p>Neither goalkeeper had had much to do by this stage, but James had showed signs of nerves when spilling a first-half cross, and looked uncomfortable again in the 53rd minute when saving from Di Matteo but making a present of the ball to Wise. The Chelsea captain accepted the gift gratefully, but his side's celebrations were cut short by an offside flag raised against Weah. </p> <p>After Gus Poyet had become the second Chelsea player cautioned for a foul on Boateng, Weah had the chance to make amends on the hour when a teasing Zola cross eluded Poyet and Villa's defensive cover at the near post, and ran through to Weah at the rear. Completely on his own, the former World Player of the Year struck early but wastefully wide. </p> <p>At least Chelsea had managed to make an impression on the game and a goal looked much more likely. Di Matteo finally broke the deadlock after Melchiot had decided he could do more than just keep an eye on the disappointing Benito Carbone, and set off on a run that saw him swap wings and interchange passes with Celestine Babayaro before Ian Taylor brought him down near the goal-line just outside the Villa area. Zola arrowed his free-kick predictably into the danger zone, James came for a punch but only ended up knocking the ball against Southgate, and in a crowded penalty area Di Matteo was on hand to sweep the rebound high into the net. It was hardly a classic Wembley winner, not a patch on his sweet strike from outside the area three years ago, but it was always likely to be enough. </p> <p>'We can only get stronger from this,' a dejected James said. 'Individual mistakes cost us the game, and mine was one of them, but we are a group of friends and we will overcome it.' </p> <p>Villa brought on Julian Joachim and Steve Stone for the final 12 minutes, to little avail.

      "bodyText": "British hooligans are being offered substantial cash rewards for footage of their violent exploits by film-makers in California who are planning to release a compilation of 'hardcore soccer violence' in time for next month's European championships. Authorities are concerned that the film, which is to include footage of attacks on police and innocent bystanders as well as pitched battles between rival gangs, will incite hooligans to further exploits. Lord Bassam, the Home Office Minister responsible for Euro 2000, last night condemned the film as 'a perverse and appalling reaction to something that brings shame to the national game and misery to those that get caught up in it.' He pledged that ministers and the police would investigate the possibility of banning the video, called Hooligan - No one likes us and we don't care. Police say that the cash offer will encourage thugs. 'This means that if you go out and have a ruck and film it, you get paid. It's basically an incitement to fight', said one senior policeman involved in monitoring hooligans. Ken Chapman, a former Metropolitan Police chief superintendent who is now Millwall's security adviser, said he was saddened that 'people want to glorify hooliganism and make a profit from it.' He said: 'The timing of it is obviously in bad taste, after Copenhagen and with Euro 2000 coming up. Sadly, though, there will be a market for this sort of thing.' The film is being advertised through British hooligan websites with promises that buyers will get 45 minutes of 'classic scenes' of violence from soccer's history. There will be footage dating back to the Sixties as well as from clashes at the World Cup in France two years ago. Producers of the film also hope to include footage of the violence which erupted between fans of Leeds United and Galatasary in Istanbul last month - leaving two Leeds supporters dead - and scenes from Arsenal-Galatasary in Copenhagen last week. They expect Steve Jones, a former member of the Sex Pistols, to narrate a commentary for the film which the advertising describes as 'no interviews, just action-packed.' Last week an Observer journalist posing as a hooligan e-mailed Stanley Video offering amateur footage of last week's fighting in Copenhagen. A swift response asked: 'What have you got and how much do you want for it?' The Observer, in collaboration with the Europe-wide soccer news website onefootball.com has now traced the man responsible for producing the film. He is Leslie Thompson, an English electrical contractor based in West Hollywood. Thompson originally came from Newcastle, and moved to the Los Angeles area about 20 years ago. He has a home in West Hollywood and keeps a sailing boat at Marina del Rey, near Venice Beach. Confronted at the postal box service on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles which he uses as his business address, Thompson said: 'Obviously we're trying to make some money so it is a bit sensationalist.' He claimed that the film did not endorse hooliganism, but 'we are showing that it's often not the fans' fault,' he said. 'Often the foreign police don't go about controlling it correctly and go over the top. The quality of policing is often not what it should be.

I have to put my hands up.' At the final whistle, James cut a distraught figure as he lay on the Wembley turf, with his shirt pulled up above his eyes, as if trying to hide from the world. He admitted that he was in tears after the game 'for the first time in about 15 years'. Team-mate Paul Merson rallied to James's defence, saying: 'I don't blame him for the goal. He's been in a different class all season. People make mistakes. But if it wasn't for him, we wouldn't be where we are.' Villa captain Gareth Southgate said that Villa had given everything all afternoon 'but it wasn't quite good enough'. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr George Carey, agreed, saying: 'It was dull, really. The game needed an early goal.' Chelsea's Italian forward Gianfranco Zola said: 'After what we produced in the game, I think we deserved it. Villa were very honourable opponents but in the end we deserved to win.' Frank Leboeuf said Chelsea's persistence paid off: 'In the first half we didn't play very well and didn't find each other properly. But in the second half we did what we had to do: we created chances.' Chelsea captain Dennis Wise laughed off the apparent breach of FA etiquette by some Chelsea players in bringing their children on to the pitch amid the post-match celebrations.

      "body": "<p>Relations between Libya and the UK are thawing. A new embassy in Knightsbridge is dispensing visas. British Airways and Libyan Airlines are carrying oil workers and businessmen to Tripoli several times a week. So it is 'all clear' for UK travellers to trade political preconceptions and strong drink (Libya is 'dry') and enjoy this fascinating North African country. </p> <p>Lunching under an acacia tree in Wadi Mathhendusc, a dry riverbed dissecting the Messak plateau of the south-west Libyan desert - the Fezzan - I discovered a Stone Age cutting tool lying at my feet. Not an unusual occurrence, for millions of prehistoric relics - spearheads, arrowheads, crushing and cutting tools, shards of pottery and ostrich eggshells - litter the plateau, the high dunes, the dry wadi beds and the verdant oases of the Fezzan. </p> <p>Around 12000 BC, the people who roamed the once lush savannah, hunted elephant, giraffe, rhino, ostrich and crocodile. They were also talented artists who engraved their observations in the rocky cliffs above the many rivers with a purity of line of which Picasso would have been envious. They depicted the gentle movements of giraffes, the lumbering bulk of rhino, the last moments of a dying elephant and the lassooing of a group of ostriches. In fact, 12,000 years of civilisation can be charted through the engravings and delicate rock paintings of the area: the slow march of climate change, the shift from hunting to pastoral pursuits, tribal differences, mysterious religious ceremonies, the introduction of the horse and finally, as the desert encroached, the camel. </p> <p>The water still runs deep below the surface of the wadis that criss-cross the Fezzan and it is here that scrubby trees, bushes and scratchy grass support myriad animal life. The evidence is in the sand. The droppings of camel, goat, gazelle and ibex. The spoor of a fox poised above a gerbil burrow, a bird picking off a dying lizard, the antics of kangaroo mice (who hop on hind legs only) and the scurrying scarab beetle. But to catch sight of a fox you must sleep out under the starry desert sky and I had chosen a more luxurious option. </p> <p>With more than 30 years' desert experience, Italians Sergio Scarpa Falce and his wife Adrianna have fulfilled a long-cherished dream of organising a fixed camp deep in the Sahara from which to inculcate tourists in the beauty and diversity of the desert. Deep in the Acacus mountains in a stunning amphitheatre topped with rock sculptures whittled by the wind, they have created Camp Auis. The 20 double tents have wooden floors, comfortable beds, feather duvets and pillows and electric light from 7am to 10.30pm. Hot water is brought to your tent in the morning for a splash wash at your basin, as well as hot, sweet tea. Each tent is assigned its own private lavatory and shower in a separate block. Showers are taken in the late afternoon after the water has had time to heat up, but plans are under way for guaranteeing hot water via solar power by next year. The dining room is well-supplied by excellent local produce, supplemented by shipments of food from Italy, Egypt and Tunisia. A well is mooted for the camp and the village; in the meantime, water is brought in by tankers, siphoned from the desert aquifers in part of Libyan leader Colonel Muammar Gadaffi's great 'man-made river' project. </p> <p>I spent four days and nights at the camp and each was filled with new surprises. In the ever-changing landscape of the desert we met one of the seven remaining nomadic families in Libya; we saw a camel giving birth; we wandered through wadis accompanied by chirping mulla mulla birds; we raced across the desert plains in four-wheel-drive Toyotas at 60 miles an hour, our Tuareg drivers vying with each other to get there first (wherever 'there' was); we leapt over impossible, impassable dunes, whipped into geometric knife-edges by the ever-present desert wind; we came across cracked, salt lakes where strange, bulbous trees live and die; snowy white patches of gypsum; swathes of green plants with pale purple flowers, a consequence of three days' rain two months before; and, unforgettably, the great blue-green slashes of still water, fringed with succulent date palms and stands of pampas grass, that comprise the beautiful oases of Um El Maa, Mandara, Mafu and Gabraoun, where turtle doves flutter through the air, tiny pink shrimps swirl in the water and, on that occasion, a solitary white camel was tethered on the shady bank. </p> <p>White camels are highly prized and our Targi driver, Barka, told me that his family had won races across the Arab world with his 15-strong herd. In high summer he will leave his village and go with his family and his camels into the desert. When I explained that England has no desert, he exclaimed sadly: 'Then there is no yellow'. </p> <p>The Tuareg are not of Libya, Algeria, Niger, or Mali, they are the people of the Sahara. Their native tongue, Tamashek, uses neither Arabic nor Roman script. But they have had to adapt, taking Libyan nationality, settling in villages and learning Arabic, and French, or Italian and English. Proud, honest and exceedingly generous, they are a joy to be around. They acted as drivers, guides and cooks, regaling us with traditional songs, dispensing chilled water from goatskin bags, and, on one occasion, picking herbs from a desert bush to alleviate constipation. Every day after lunch they brewed Tuareg cham pagne - strong green tea boiled over a driftwood fire, poured from a height to make cappuccino-like foam, then reheated and poured into small glasses with plenty of sugar. </p> <p>The Tuareg were a thorn in the side of ancient Rome, plundering the trade routes from Africa to the port of Leptis Magna (one hour east of Tripoli). Eventually the Romans were forced to make peace, safeguarding the vital shipments of ivory, slaves and wild animals sent to Rome for gladiatorial displays. These are graphically shown in Ridley Scott' s new film Gladiator which is set in the reign of the decadent Emperor Commodus (son of Marcus Aurelius). His lust for bloody displays in the arena helped make Leptis rich and made one of its citizens, Septimus Severius, a Libyan, Emperor of Rome. The remains of the city of Leptis with its theatre, temples, courts of justice, market, saunas, latrines, lighthouse and an intact amphitheatre are in an excellent state of repair. As is the Roman city of Sabratha (half an hour west of Tripoli) and the Greek cities of Apollonia and Cyrenica near Benghazi. </p> <p>There is little crime or unemployment in Libya and tourists are not pestered for baksheesh. Libyan women wear simple headscarves with their modern clothes, can venture out alone and are allowed to drive. The hotels and restaurants in Tripoli are excellent. The roads are good and fuel costs only 7p a litre. The historical monuments are more than worth a three-and-a-half hour flight, not to mention the romance of the desert. </p> <p><strong>Libya facts</strong></p> <p><strong> Best time to travel:</strong> October to April </p> <p><strong> Travel Tips:</strong> Take a warm jacket for nights in the desert.

The tour is based at Lake Myvtan which also offers excellent birdwatching opportunities and almost continuous daylight. Iceland's other natural spectacles can be viewed from a sightseeing flight taking in an active volcano, bubbling mud pools and steam vents. Departures start on 1 June and continue until the end of September.

The trek starts 1,200 miles east of Ulaanbaatar on the western edge of the Mongolia steppes, where the group's baggage is taken to the remote base camp by camel. From there, travellers will take part in daily ascents of the three highest peaks in Mongolia, including Mount Khuiten. The expedition is led by experienced western guides, and a crew of six at the base camp will take care of the cooking. After flying back to Ulaanbaatar, there are visits to nomadic herdsmen in their camps outside the city with a chance to try their traditional wrestling and horse-riding.

There is a dispute over what the new watchdog should be called. </p> <p>The football authorities had suggested the Independent Scrutiny Panel, but it may actually emerge next month with a different title. Inside Sport also understands that there is growing opposition to Dr Jack Cunningham, the ex-Cabinet minister, chairing the new body. 'His links to Sir John Hall, the rest of the Hall family and Newcastle United in general mean he wouldn't be seen as truly independent,' said one source. 'Some people think he'd be a soft touch for the Premier League.' </p> <p>Controversy also surrounds the possible appointment of Sir Roland Smith, the chairman of Manchester United's plc arm. However, his obvious financial interest in the game may render him unsuitable. Someone who may well be one of the panel's five or six members is the black Tory peer Lord Taylor of Warwick, a Villa fan who is greatly concerned about the activities of agents selling young African players to European clubs. </p> <p>A person with a background in a football supporters organisation will also be on.

      "bodyText": "Watchdog wait Moves to create a groundbreaking football regulator have reached 'the difficult phase', according to insiders involved in the discussions. There is a dispute over what the new watchdog should be called. The football authorities had suggested the Independent Scrutiny Panel, but it may actually emerge next month with a different title. Inside Sport also understands that there is growing opposition to Dr Jack Cunningham, the ex-Cabinet minister, chairing the new body. 'His links to Sir John Hall, the rest of the Hall family and Newcastle United in general mean he wouldn't be seen as truly independent,' said one source. 'Some people think he'd be a soft touch for the Premier League.' Controversy also surrounds the possible appointment of Sir Roland Smith, the chairman of Manchester United's plc arm. However, his obvious financial interest in the game may render him unsuitable. Someone who may well be one of the panel's five or six members is the black Tory peer Lord Taylor of Warwick, a Villa fan who is greatly concerned about the activities of agents selling young African players to European clubs. A person with a background in a football supporters organisation will also be on.

      "body": "<p>For someone who was only 15 at the time, Kevin Keegan spends a lot of time talking about England's one and only World Cup win. </p> <p>In the course of a 40-minute press briefing last week, Keegan mentioned 1966 and all that on three separate occasions, which practically puts him in the Alan Ball bracket. And at least Ball played in the World Cup final. </p> <p>Perhaps the meeting with Germany in Charleroi on 17 June is playing on Keegan's mind. Either that, or through spending too much time worrying about his lack of wingers he has developed an instinctive empathy with the late Sir Alf Ramsey, to whom he refers familiarly as 'Alf'. </p> <p>'I can't see the point of putting someone in just because he's got a left foot,' Keegan said, talking about the shortage of left-sided full-backs in his squad but probably making Jason Wilcox's ears prick up. 'We'll have to move people around at times, we might have to play a wing-back if we get an injury, but I think we have enough options within the squad to cover most eventualities. I know the balance could be better, but most of the other coaches are in the same boat. Even Alf had that criticism when he named his squad in 1966, but the shape of the team emerged as the tournament progressed. What Alf was thinking six months before the World Cup was different to what he did in the tournament.' </p> <p>What Alf famously did in 1966 was drop Jimmy Greaves and play without wingers. As long as Alan Shearer remains captain and David Beckham's crossing ability is required, there seems little chance of Keegan doing anything quite so drastic, but he may go half way to winglessness. Steve McManaman's form for Real Madrid appears to have edged him ahead of Wilcox, the Leeds United winger who is in the 28-man squad basically for his left-footedness. McManaman has a Champions League final on Wednesday, and will not join up with England in time for Saturday's friendly against Brazil, but previous disappointments in an England shirt appear likely to be forgotten if the former Liverpool player has another outstanding game in Paris. </p> <p>'Steve has earned the right to be reconsidered by forcing people to change their minds and yes, I can see a way to harness him, maybe playing left side,' Keegan said. 'In the past it has been a bit of a mish-mash with people playing out of position on the left, but a Steve McManaman in form for Real Madrid is different from a Steve McManaman having a bit of a struggle at Liverpool. He's playing with confidence now, and confidence is everything.' </p> <p>So it is, though while most people would agree that McManaman at his best is a more versatile and creative player than Wilcox, it should be remembered that the two are not necessarily interchangeable. With Beckham, Paul Ince and Paul Scholes more or less assured of midfield places, left wing seems the only available spot for McManaman to occupy, but to get the most from him England need to allow him a measure of freedom and preferably support his ability to hold the ball with intelligent movement to create passing options. They need to play more like Real Madrid, in other words. If they intend to carry on playing like England, with wingers attempting to reach the by-line and put crosses in for Shearer, Wilcox remains the best option. </p> <p>The other area of doubt for Keegan to work on in the next three games is who plays support striker to Shearer. Michael Owen is the favourite at the moment, with Emile Heskey as reserve, and Robbie Fowler, Andy Cole and Kevin Phillips contesting the final two squad places. Since the last three are more prolific scorers than the first two Keegan knows he will attract criticism whichever way he jumps, but insists he has an open mind at this stage. 'I've been quoted as saying I don't want to take Andy Cole, but I've never said that,' he said. </p> <p>'You can't find any quotes from me that say Andy Cole is in doubt for Euro 2000. I bought and sold Andy Cole, and I only sold him to take Newcastle on. None of the others except Shearer have scored goals at this level, and that includes Cole, but in seven games he's only had two starts, so he deserves a chance. So does Fowler, who is fit, but needs matches. It might be a slight gamble if we take Robbie, but in a 22-man squad you can take one gamble.' </p> <p>Just one last time for the record, England will not be gambling on penalty shoot-outs. 'We will practise penal ties,' Keegan said. 'Teams will go through on penalty shoot-outs, you can be sure. I still stick with what I said earlier though. You can practise all you want, but you can never replicate the shoot-out situation.' </p> <p>True, but a few practise shots in training might have stood David Batty in better stead two years ago. 'Glenn Hoddle probably wouldn't have had David Batty practising penalties anyway,' Keegan said. 'He couldn't possi bly have known he would have one man sent off, one with cramp, and have to play 70 minutes with 10 men.' </p> <p>Batty's penalty was the beginning of the end for Hoddle, as Keegan knows. 'The flak will fly if it doesn't go well, but I'm quite happy to be judged by results,' he said. 'It's my job to be positive, and I've got the chance to do something no England manager has ever done before, to win a tournament away from home.'</p>",

With Beckham, Paul Ince and Paul Scholes more or less assured of midfield places, left wing seems the only available spot for McManaman to occupy, but to get the most from him England need to allow him a measure of freedom and preferably support his ability to hold the ball with intelligent movement to create passing options. They need to play more like Real Madrid, in other words. If they intend to carry on playing like England, with wingers attempting to reach the by-line and put crosses in for Shearer, Wilcox remains the best option. The other area of doubt for Keegan to work on in the next three games is who plays support striker to Shearer. Michael Owen is the favourite at the moment, with Emile Heskey as reserve, and Robbie Fowler, Andy Cole and Kevin Phillips contesting the final two squad places. Since the last three are more prolific scorers than the first two Keegan knows he will attract criticism whichever way he jumps, but insists he has an open mind at this stage. 'I've been quoted as saying I don't want to take Andy Cole, but I've never said that,' he said. 'You can't find any quotes from me that say Andy Cole is in doubt for Euro 2000. I bought and sold Andy Cole, and I only sold him to take Newcastle on. None of the others except Shearer have scored goals at this level, and that includes Cole, but in seven games he's only had two starts, so he deserves a chance. So does Fowler, who is fit, but needs matches. It might be a slight gamble if we take Robbie, but in a 22-man squad you can take one gamble.' Just one last time for the record, England will not be gambling on penalty shoot-outs. 'We will practise penal ties,' Keegan said. 'Teams will go through on penalty shoot-outs, you can be sure. I still stick with what I said earlier though. You can practise all you want, but you can never replicate the shoot-out situation.' True, but a few practise shots in training might have stood David Batty in better stead two years ago. 'Glenn Hoddle probably wouldn't have had David Batty practising penalties anyway,' Keegan said. 'He couldn't possi bly have known he would have one man sent off, one with cramp, and have to play 70 minutes with 10 men.' Batty's penalty was the beginning of the end for Hoddle, as Keegan knows. 'The flak will fly if it doesn't go well, but I'm quite happy to be judged by results,' he said. 'It's my job to be positive, and I've got the chance to do something no England manager has ever done before, to win a tournament away from home.'",

Four of them ended up in the top 10, including their 'as live' - that is, slightly delayed but shown in full - coverage of the Scotland-England Euro 2000 qualifier from Hampden Park. The 9.4 million viewers they got for this game confirmed the lasting popularity of the traditional free-to-air broadcasters. The actual live coverage on Sky drew an audience of 2.07 million, while the second leg at Wembley - shown live on both ITV and Sky - produced the season's table-topping viewing figure of 14.6 million for ITV while just over a million chose satellite. </p> <p>Once again Manchester United dominated the top 10 with seven entries, although, perhaps significantly, none of their Champions League matches made it into the top three. Is Uefa's decision to allow so many non-champions into their Champions League having an effect?</p> <p>One advantage - and it is a sizeable one - that clubs relegated from the Premiership have over the teams they join in the First Division is the television money they take down with them. Wimbledon, for example, are already guaranteed a parting gift of \u00a34.3 million made up of a merit award of nearly \u00a3700,000 and an equal share of the Sky TV money, which this time around works out at \u00a33.65 million per club. </p> <p>In all they are likely to collect close to \u00a36 million by the time the fees for their TV appearances last season - live on Sky and on the BBC's Match of the Day - are paid. In addition they will get a so-called parachute payment - 50 per cent of the equal share - for the next two seasons. </p> <p>Meanwhile, teams coming up from the First Division to the Premiership have to make do with the far sparser television rewards paid to Football League clubs as they seek to make their squads strong enough to survive in the top flight. All of which almost certainly accounts for the fact that clubs trying to go straight back up from the First Division tend to be more successful than the new arrivals in the Premiership are at fighting off relegation.

One advantage - and it is a sizeable one - that clubs relegated from the Premiership have over the teams they join in the First Division is the television money they take down with them. Wimbledon, for example, are already guaranteed a parting gift of \u00a34.3 million made up of a merit award of nearly \u00a3700,000 and an equal share of the Sky TV money, which this time around works out at \u00a33.65 million per club. In all they are likely to collect close to \u00a36 million by the time the fees for their TV appearances last season - live on Sky and on the BBC's Match of the Day - are paid. In addition they will get a so-called parachute payment - 50 per cent of the equal share - for the next two seasons. Meanwhile, teams coming up from the First Division to the Premiership have to make do with the far sparser television rewards paid to Football League clubs as they seek to make their squads strong enough to survive in the top flight. All of which almost certainly accounts for the fact that clubs trying to go straight back up from the First Division tend to be more successful than the new arrivals in the Premiership are at fighting off relegation. Perhaps some thought should be given to redressing this. Top 10 football matches 1999-2000 1. England v Scotland Euro 2000 qualifier (ITV) 14.6m 2.

'Well I was the one who discovered Gaizka Mendieta.' 'That's fine Guus, when can you start?' replied the Celtic directors in unison. </p> <p>Blond Valencia midfielder Mendieta might not be a household name, but he unites opinion in everyone who witnesses his delightful football. If ever a player were available who could justify the kind of exorbitant fees commanded by players such as Inter's Christian Vieri, then it would be Mendieta. </p> <p>But then the Basque-born Gaizka (pronounced: guyshka) is unlikely to be ever available, one of the old school, a player who would rather not complicate his professional life and see out his time with just one club - a rarity in modern football. Mendieta, much to the chagrin of Spanish coaches - who this week voted him along with Real Madrid's Ra\u00fal as the best national player - will be sticking with Valencia. </p> <p>'Mendieta is the type of player every team would love to have,' said the Rangers coach Dick Advocaat after his side faced Valencia in the first group stage. 'Not just skilful, but with imagination, and full of running and working for his team.' 'Dick was just drooling about him after going out to watch his team in Spain,' said John Greig, Rangers' former captain and manager. </p> <p>Anyone who sees Valencia play generally fixes on the skilful, bustling, hard-working midfielder and the speed and effectiveness of Claudio Lopez up front. Fans love the tireless and tough Mendieta on the right, one minute back in defence helping out, moments later up the other end feeding another ball into the channel for Lopez to seize on, and every now and again getting into the box himself. In short, the sort of player everyone wants in their team. The Spanish national coach, Jos\u00e9-Antonio Camacho, describes him as the all-round player personified. </p> <p>And then there are the goals: not just the quantity you expect from an all-round player, but beauties, goals that, if compiled on an agent's videotape and sent to the moneybags chairmen of the very richest clubs, would solicit a 'sign that player' response. </p> <p>The moment when everyone sat up and took notice came in last year's Spanish Cup final, when the Valencia captain gave as complete and dominant a performance as one could wish to see. Totally dominating his side of the pitch, and blunting the effectiveness of the Atletico Madrid midfield, he set up a goal for Lopez and capped his one-man show with a goal that will remain forever in the memories of Spanish fans. With his back to goal, Mendieta turned, flicked the ball over his marker's head, controlled it in the area and evaded the tackle of another opponent before scoring. The word from the Nou Camp, Santiago Bernabeu, San Siro <em>et al</em> after that goal was: Sign up Mendieta. The mobile phone of Mendieta's agent, he later revealed, never stopped ringing; doubtless the line at the Mestalla club offices fairly hummed too. </p> <p>The Valencia board got to work. Mendieta's contract was due to expire in 2000, he could have seen it out, or just taken one of the offers from the team's then guaranteeing Champions League football the following season. </p> <p>Valencia are not a powerhouse, and the club has had cash-flow problems. 'Mendieta is an emblem of the club,' declared Valencia president Pedro Cortes, and the cup winners promptly handed their captain a new eight-year deal that doubled his earnings... netting him about \u00a31.25 million. </p> <p>'Everything I ever wanted as a footballer I've achieved in 1999, given that apart from winning the cup, I was called up by Spain and extended my contract with Valencia,' he said, newly rich and newly capped. The cup-final goal was compared in Spain to one scored by Pele in the World Cup finals in 1958. Mendieta, who admitted that he was proud to be compared to the great Brazilian, showed an extremely rare lapse of his accustomed modesty when he said he thought his goal was better. </p> <p>It's not the first time his goals - 18 this season - have earned such comparisons. Following one mazy run away at Athletic Bilbao, former coach Claudio Ranieri said 'I can only compare that goal to Maradona.' Viewers in the UK may have seen Mendieta's Nou Camp goal from last year's cup run, when he volleyed a corner from outside the area which rocketed into the top corner. It was unstoppable. </p> <p>Mendieta is not a typical football star. Quiet and unassuming, shy, quite different from his appearance on the pitch. He was a conscientious objector and refused to do his military service; consequently he was required to work for the social services instead, and and didn't use his professional football to get out of it. </p> <p>In his formative years, he alternated between right-back and holding and organising midfielder, but says that his preferred position is what is known in Spain as the 'pivot' - in front of the back-line, and not just responsible for destruction, but also creation of play. </p> <p>'At this moment I'm not thinking of changing team.

Turning 31 last Thursday won't go down as one of his most convivial celebrations. </p> <p>A lonely schlep down the motorways of northern Europe with a head full of frustration and failure is no recipe for a swinging party. All those hours in the car staring out of the window with nothing to do but think probably didn't help him to digest another large dose of disappointment. Why is it that showpiece games keep dragging him down? Copenhagen 2000 was not the first time the media has built him up as a potential matchwinner only to cackle in his face. In the end his performance was so indifferent he was hauled off before he had the chance to miss a penalty. </p> <p>The onus is always on the extraordinary player to make the difference and he is always expected to be the star, the catalyst. Arriving in Denmark last week he knew it was about time he enjoyed his moment on the major stage again. After a series of downers, he felt good before the game. Sharp, strong, excited even. But he didn't produce. He flickered, but never quite sparked to life. The fact is that big games no longer elicit the best of Bergkamp. </p> <p>What to do with his enigmatic Dutchman is the single biggest question facing Ars\u00e8ne Wenger over the summer. Yes, he has to ensure the futures of Marc Overmars and Emmanuel Petit, and entice a new striker, central midfield back-up and perhaps a centre-half among others. Bergkamp, though, is key. He has a year left on his contract and reportedly wants an extension. So far, in his five seasons at Highbury he has been guaranteed his place if fit. </p> <p>But this season's statistics make you wonder how long that faith can continue: he lasted 90 minutes only eight times all season in the Premiership. He scored only six league goals. Of course there is more to him than goalscoring, but he would be the first to admit this has been a largely disappointing campaign. Wenger has to decide to what extent Arsenal can afford to carry someone who plays in such a critical position as Bergkamp when the striker's in one of his depressed moods. </p> <p>Too often he reacts to close marking as if it's an insulting invasion of space and becomes ratty instead of rising above it to teach some stopper a lesson. High on intelligence and fiercely private, Bergkamp has always come across as slightly intense, but sometimes these days he's so unrelaxed he can't play his normal game - especially in Europe, where he puts himself under extra pressure because of his travel arrangements (he won't fly). It's interesting to recall how Manchester United only clicked for real in Europe when their own icon, Eric Cantona, was out of the equation. </p> <p>Wenger has always found Bergkamp fascinating. He studies his precious No 10 in the same way a trainer tries to understand the idiosyncrasies of a brilliant racehorse, where so many complexities and delicate details have to be right to ensure peak performance. </p> <p>But now he must ask himself whether his playmaker has simply had a desperate run of poor luck or, more worryingly, if he just doesn't have the head for high-tension games anymore. Frank Rijkaard, Bergkamp's national coach, is probably pondering the same thing. His Holland berth for Euro 2000 was under considerable threat until something snapped in Ruud van Nistelrooy's knee. </p> <p>Nobody is asking for 90 minutes of unadulterated genius, but just a few telling moments capable of changing a game would do. Consider the last time Bergkamp reigned supreme over a grand occasion. It was nearly two years ago - two years ago! - when Holland stunned Argentina in the dying embers of a fiery tussle in the World Cup quarter-finals. He had been subdued for most of the game and suddenly scored the most beautiful and technically accomplished goal of the tournament. Then it all went wrong. There was no repeat in the semi-final against Brazil and Holland went out via the agony of the penalty shoot-out. Bergkamp scored his (as the iceman always used to do), but others weren't so lucky. </p> <p>Penalties. Damn penalties. Bergkamp has never been the same since he had the chance to fulfil a long-standing FA Cup Final dream with a last-minute spot-kick against Manchester United in 1999's epic semi-final replay. He rates Peter Schmeichel's save as one of his most heartbreaking moments in football. His hatred of the penalty has spread like a virus through the ranks of Highbury. Nine Arsenal players were cursed from 12 yards this season. </p> <p>It can't only be ill fortune. If losing one penalty shoot-out is unlucky and two is plain careless, three is a major psychological barrier. For all the multitude of positives Wenger has brought to Arsenal, they have lost some of their mental toughness. They never gave the impression of being fully motivated for the Uefa Cup Final. The manager aknowledged afterwards that Galatasaray were more 'up for it' - a reflection of Wenger's biggest weakness. Sometimes players need a whip to be cracked or a carrot dangled but he doesn't like raised voices in the dressing room, and expects the individuals in his team to be rounded enough to raise themselves. The price you pay for bringing in foreign quality is an eroding sense of closeness and comradeship. Today's multicultural squads are made up of fellow professionals, not mates. </p> <p>As Galatasaray bounded on to their bus with the trophy, their bond of friendship was there for all to see. They bellowed their victory songs and hammered the windows, danced in the aisles and jumped on the seats. You couldn't imagine Arsenal would have been half as expressive even if they had emerged triumphant. </p> <p>Leaving the Parken behind in a manner so different to last time around in 1994, Tony Adams tried to be philosophical, saying that what matters is how you get up from a fall.

      "body": "<p>British art experts are dismayed by an Italian motorway project which threatens a major site on the 'Piero trail' on the Tuscan/Umbrian border. </p> <p>Ten years ago Piero della Francesca's Madonna del parto fresco was painstakingly removed from a tiny chapel near Monterchi, for display in a specially prepared building on the edge of the ancient village. Now road planners want to build a motorway within feet of the permanent exhibition. </p> <p>The highway will be raised on stilts, destroying the view of the village from the surrounding plains. </p> <p>'This is sacrilege,' said Royal Academician Sir Frederick Gore, who has painted several views of the village. 'The Piero was moved to its present site at great risk. It is now properly displayed in what is something like a shrine to his work.' </p> <p>The road starts in Arezzo, where Piero's work in the church of San Francesco (featured in Escape 's Italy Special on 7 May) has only recently opened to view after years of restoration. Monterchi is included with Arezzo and Sansepolcro on a trail taken by many art lovers to see the Renaissance master's work. </p> <p>Dr Patricia Rubin, Renaissance specialist at London's Courtauld Institute of Art, is not surprised by the plans. 'The Italians have always been quite irresponsible about their landscape, and developments to facilitate the motor car are completely uncontrolled. I am sure there are any number of political and economic factors involved because people make a lot of money from building roads. </p> <p>'I am very distressed about the effect this highway would have on the landscape,' she added. 'Although I am critical of the fresco's present setting, it is very tied to the town's identity. It is an unexpected and grandiose image in such a remote region.'

      "bodyText": "British art experts are dismayed by an Italian motorway project which threatens a major site on the 'Piero trail' on the Tuscan/Umbrian border. Ten years ago Piero della Francesca's Madonna del parto fresco was painstakingly removed from a tiny chapel near Monterchi, for display in a specially prepared building on the edge of the ancient village. Now road planners want to build a motorway within feet of the permanent exhibition. The highway will be raised on stilts, destroying the view of the village from the surrounding plains. 'This is sacrilege,' said Royal Academician Sir Frederick Gore, who has painted several views of the village. 'The Piero was moved to its present site at great risk. It is now properly displayed in what is something like a shrine to his work.' The road starts in Arezzo, where Piero's work in the church of San Francesco (featured in Escape 's Italy Special on 7 May) has only recently opened to view after years of restoration. Monterchi is included with Arezzo and Sansepolcro on a trail taken by many art lovers to see the Renaissance master's work. Dr Patricia Rubin, Renaissance specialist at London's Courtauld Institute of Art, is not surprised by the plans. 'The Italians have always been quite irresponsible about their landscape, and developments to facilitate the motor car are completely uncontrolled. I am sure there are any number of political and economic factors involved because people make a lot of money from building roads. 'I am very distressed about the effect this highway would have on the landscape,' she added. 'Although I am critical of the fresco's present setting, it is very tied to the town's identity. It is an unexpected and grandiose image in such a remote region.' British protesters are invited to write to Signor Antonio Rolle of the Committee for the Protection of Monterchi, Il Palasetto, Borgecciano, Monterchi, Italy. More visitors to Northern Ireland Despite the stuttering progress of the peace talks, Northern Ireland is reaping a 'peace dividend', reporting a record number of visitors in 1999. For the first time ever more than a million British visitors crossed the Irish Sea last year. Crucially, 100,000 of these visitors travelled on holiday, up 23 per cent on 1998. David McAuley, acting chief executive of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, said: 'This growth is a reflection of the real progress which has been made in the last two years both politically with the peace process and economically with the investment of our public and private industry part ners.'

      "body": "<p><strong> Booking</strong> </p> <p> EasyJet sells 67 per cent of its seats on the Net. I had never entrusted my credit card number to the Internet, but chose to go with the flow. The easyJet website is clear, listing available fares for each flight. Amsterdam ranged from \u00a322.50 to \u00a397.50. I chose a flight out for \u00a337.50 and back for \u00a347.50 (total, \u00a397.30 with taxes). I entered my payment details and four minutes passed before I read: 'Sorry, there has been a problem with the database. Please come back and try later.' I clicked on the 'Back' button. 'Your browser just lost all the data pertaining to this reservation. It's a common problem with MS Explorer 3.' This seemed bad news. I phoned reservations and was assured my booking had been received. I asked if this had happened before. 'It's actually very common,' he replied, but couldn't tell me if my card number was now available to hackers worldwide. </p> <p> <strong> Tickets</strong> </p> <p> EasyJet is a ticketless airline: my confirmation number was e-mailed to me. </p> <p> <strong> Check-in</strong> </p> <p> I checked in an hour before take-off. Luton is a refreshing (and well-signposted) change from the disorientating expanses of Heathrow. Staff were courteous and efficient. </p> <p> <strong> Boarding</strong></p> <p> <strong>Outbound:</strong> Screens announced that my flight was delayed from 12.45 to 13.20, due to a late departure from Amsterdam. I asked the easyJet helpdesk for information; it was not even aware that the flight was late. At 13.30 we began boarding. EasyJet does not allocate seats. Numbered boarding passes are issued according to the time you check in: early birds get the pick of the seats. </p> <p><strong> Inbound:</strong> the flight departed punctually at 11.50. </p> <p> <strong> Take-off</strong> </p> <p> No problem, on either leg. </p> <p> <strong> Ambience/decor</strong> </p> <p> Orange! Cabin staff were young and cheerful. </p> <p> <strong> Catering</strong> </p> <p> No hot meals on the one-hour flights. Sandwiches (from \u00a32.50) and drinks (coffee \u00a31.10, fruit juice 60p). </p> <p> <strong> Service</strong> </p> <p> Attentive and discreet service meant that when I fell asleep (thanks to the surprising leg-room), I wasn't disturbed. </p> <p> <strong> Arrival</strong> </p> <p> My baggage arrived promptly. Trains leave Schiphol for Amsterdam's Central Station every 15 minutes. Single tickets for the 20-minute journey cost 6.50 guilders (\u00a32). </p> <p> <strong> Verdict</strong> </p> <p> The price I paid was reasonable for such friendly departure times.

      "bodyText": "Booking EasyJet sells 67 per cent of its seats on the Net. I had never entrusted my credit card number to the Internet, but chose to go with the flow. The easyJet website is clear, listing available fares for each flight. Amsterdam ranged from \u00a322.50 to \u00a397.50. I chose a flight out for \u00a337.50 and back for \u00a347.50 (total, \u00a397.30 with taxes). I entered my payment details and four minutes passed before I read: 'Sorry, there has been a problem with the database. Please come back and try later.' I clicked on the 'Back' button. 'Your browser just lost all the data pertaining to this reservation. It's a common problem with MS Explorer 3.' This seemed bad news. I phoned reservations and was assured my booking had been received. I asked if this had happened before. 'It's actually very common,' he replied, but couldn't tell me if my card number was now available to hackers worldwide. Tickets EasyJet is a ticketless airline: my confirmation number was e-mailed to me. Check-in I checked in an hour before take-off. Luton is a refreshing (and well-signposted) change from the disorientating expanses of Heathrow. Staff were courteous and efficient. Boarding Outbound: Screens announced that my flight was delayed from 12.45 to 13.20, due to a late departure from Amsterdam. I asked the easyJet helpdesk for information; it was not even aware that the flight was late. At 13.30 we began boarding. EasyJet does not allocate seats. Numbered boarding passes are issued according to the time you check in: early birds get the pick of the seats. Inbound: the flight departed punctually at 11.50. Take-off No problem, on either leg. Ambience/decor Orange! Cabin staff were young and cheerful. Catering No hot meals on the one-hour flights. Sandwiches (from \u00a32.50) and drinks (coffee \u00a31.10, fruit juice 60p). Service Attentive and discreet service meant that when I fell asleep (thanks to the surprising leg-room), I wasn't disturbed. Arrival My baggage arrived promptly. Trains leave Schiphol for Amsterdam's Central Station every 15 minutes. Single tickets for the 20-minute journey cost 6.50 guilders (\u00a32). Verdict The price I paid was reasonable for such friendly departure times. As for the Internet: once bitten, twice shy. Rating out of 10 Service 8 Value 7 No-frills Amsterdam Cheap eat D'Theeboom (Singel 210: 00 31 20 623 8420) serves three courses for 47 guilders (about \u00a313). Cheap sleep I found a short-let canal-side apartment (from Amsterdam Apartments 00 31 20 62 65 930), which, at \u00a350 a night for two, was comparable to a medium-priced hotel. Typical thing to do I preferred the engaging Stedelijk Museum of Modern Art to both the Van Gogh and Rembrandt museums. Less typical Beyond the Botanical Gardens is the Tropenmuseum, a collection of anthropological artifacts from around the world. Traveller's tip Hire a bicycle to explore the canal paths.

Free speech became established early in Scotland, as he explains it, not because of the abstract vigour of the people but because of the sparseness of the population and the poverty of the soil: landowners could not afford to dismiss labourers, however stroppy. This is a characteristic Alasdair Gravian analysis - an absolute good becoming a reality in relatively few circumstances. From his point of view, the real casualties of the dissolution of the monasteries were the poor, since 'church social welfare' ended and a hundred hospitals were closed in a single year.

Gray responds to fancy effects without wholly respecting them, and his loyalty is all to robustness and clarity, to writing with a connection to ordinary talk.

Having won the privilege of making the first speech to London's new Assembly as its first Chair, I felt that I had to live up to the occasion. A colleague later accused me of being 'urbane', for which read 'smooth bastard'. On reflection, I should have been direct. Instead of saying: 'We have some way to go to represent the diversity of London with just two black members', I should have said to the Assembly: 'In a city where at least one in three of us is black or brown, the fact that fewer than one in 10 of us around this table fits that description is a disgrace.'</p> <p>Of course, you shouldn't judge a book by its cover. There are, apparently, no Asian members of the capital's new assembly. In fact, two of my Labour colleagues are descended in part from Anglo-Asians. In many senses, they represent the ethnic diversity of modern London better than those of us from particular communities. But even if we include them, the shameful fact is that in the four devolved assemblies - Scotland, Wales Northern Ireland, and London - our newest democratic institutions are virtually whites-only areas.</p> <p>Our new democracy is ethnically-cleansed. Swathes of the British people have become disappeared persons. But if political parties fail to put a range of candidates before the people, the outcome is hardly surprising. No party, other than Labour, put a single black or Asian candidate in a winnable constituency.</p> <p>The smaller parties could, I suppose, claim that they have so few seats that it's hard for them to represent the spread of the population. But the two largest parties have no excuse. William Hague's problem is that his party's rank and file manifestly does not want to be represented by black or Asian people.</p> <p>Labour's high command has no such constraints. The leadership of the party is desperate to put competent, non-white people into office, and has discreetly tried to use the Millbank machine to widen its range of candidates. For example, the vetting panel which grilled Ken Livingstone also put forward more black, Asian and Chinese candidates than any similar process in the party's history. Yet despite all this effort, we have little to show by way of success.</p> <p>The price of our failure is greater by far than that of the other parties. Leading Labour figures have been debating the party's appeal to its so-called 'core vote'. Some talk as though this 'core' consists entirely of the old, blue-collar vote, the traditional, white working classes. The London elections starkly demonstrated that this is no longer the truth. Our core vote may well be working class, but it is also black and Asian. These voters are just as concerned about crime, transport and jobs as anyone else. Labour is their natural home. Nine out of 10 African-Caribbeans and two out of three Asian voters back Labour. Even though Frank Dobson's share of the vote in the election fell to depths previously unthinkable for a Labour candidate in a Labour-voting city, the evidence is that those who stayed loyal to Labour were disproportionately Asian and African.</p> <p>But unlike other voters, at the top of their political agenda is a deep frustration that they are voting for a political leadership that excludes them. Again and again on the doorstep, I found that black and Asian voters did not want to talk about policy, but took me to task for not running as Mayor. The questions of whether I could have won or not, or whether Dobson would have been a better Mayor (he would), were irrelevant to them. They wanted someone, anyone, to bid for the top table, not least to counter the drum beat of anti-asylum-seeker sentiment from our own government.</p> <p>Even the Left fails to grasp what is taking place here. An associate of Ken Livingstone's told The Observer last week that black people did not want to be represented by the black middle classes. He could not be more wrong. Go to any Indian community, any African-Caribbean church or any mosque and the desire to 'get on' is palpable. The talk is of 'role models' and success. That's why New Labour's failure to elevate more black and Asian people to its upper ranks carries such a sting for these communities - they want to see their own people climbing the ladder of success.</p> <p>This week, attention will be focused on the race to succeed Bernie Grant as Labour's candidate for Tottenham. There should be no assumption that this is a 'black' seat. Colour-coding parliamentary seats will only force excellent black candidates into being forced to compete with each other for the few seats where there are large numbers of black people. All four of those short-listed would make first-rate MPs.</p> <p>But several well-known black candidates were judged to be not up to the mark for a tough by-election. I doubt that there was a Blairite plot to impose a Millbank candidate. And a short list with just one white person on it could hardly be accused of being the result of racial bias. This is not, as some suppose, a lack of political will at the top. It is worse than that. The problem lies in the nature of the party itself, and we need to take a hard look at why we are failing our most committed members.</p> <p>Clearly, there are institutional barriers to black participation at the highest level. Paradoxically, improvements in the selection process may be raising the hurdles still higher for young and minority aspirants. The professionalisation of selection, with high-powered interviews and presentations, though improving the calibre of candidates, requires a kind of life experience denied to many from the minority communities. Would the young Bernie Grant have made it through the current process? Possibly not. Not because his views were too left-wing, but because his plain-spokenness would have been deemed too much of a risk with a hostile media pack.</p> <p>One member, one vote is right, but it puts a premium on having been around for long enough for local party members to know you. And the membership proved remarkably conservative in its choices. Remember, it was not the party hierarchy which knocked out so many black and Asian GLA candidates - it was the membership which voted for names with which they were familiar.</p> <p>I do not believe we should turn back the reforms, but I do believe that we can cope with them better. First, we can prepare people for the rigours of the political process. A new organisation, called EQ, is to be launched this week by leading Labour women and minority politicians. It will offer training and mentoring, even small grants to give them time off work, if needed. Second, the few black and Asian politicians who are there need to back each other up, rather than sniping at each other. Personally, I would never have made it through electoral maze without the support of Paul Boateng, Keith Vaz and Bernie Grant.</p> <p>Third, the party needs to set itself a public target. This will be hard, because it implies that some aspirants who are not black or Asian will need to put their ambitions on hold. But this is the test. Do we mean it when we say we want to be representative or not? If we do, then given that some 40-50 per cent of our vote in London is black or Asian, among our London MPs, there should be at least 25 who are not white.</p> <p>There is one constituency which recently mislaid its Labour MP - Brent East. Time to show the way.</p>",

Of course, you shouldn't judge a book by its cover. There are, apparently, no Asian members of the capital's new assembly. In fact, two of my Labour colleagues are descended in part from Anglo-Asians. In many senses, they represent the ethnic diversity of modern London better than those of us from particular communities. But even if we include them, the shameful fact is that in the four devolved assemblies - Scotland, Wales Northern Ireland, and London - our newest democratic institutions are virtually whites-only areas. Our new democracy is ethnically-cleansed. Swathes of the British people have become disappeared persons. But if political parties fail to put a range of candidates before the people, the outcome is hardly surprising. No party, other than Labour, put a single black or Asian candidate in a winnable constituency. The smaller parties could, I suppose, claim that they have so few seats that it's hard for them to represent the spread of the population. But the two largest parties have no excuse. William Hague's problem is that his party's rank and file manifestly does not want to be represented by black or Asian people. Labour's high command has no such constraints. The leadership of the party is desperate to put competent, non-white people into office, and has discreetly tried to use the Millbank machine to widen its range of candidates. For example, the vetting panel which grilled Ken Livingstone also put forward more black, Asian and Chinese candidates than any similar process in the party's history. Yet despite all this effort, we have little to show by way of success. The price of our failure is greater by far than that of the other parties. Leading Labour figures have been debating the party's appeal to its so-called 'core vote'. Some talk as though this 'core' consists entirely of the old, blue-collar vote, the traditional, white working classes. The London elections starkly demonstrated that this is no longer the truth. Our core vote may well be working class, but it is also black and Asian. These voters are just as concerned about crime, transport and jobs as anyone else. Labour is their natural home. Nine out of 10 African-Caribbeans and two out of three Asian voters back Labour. Even though Frank Dobson's share of the vote in the election fell to depths previously unthinkable for a Labour candidate in a Labour-voting city, the evidence is that those who stayed loyal to Labour were disproportionately Asian and African. But unlike other voters, at the top of their political agenda is a deep frustration that they are voting for a political leadership that excludes them. Again and again on the doorstep, I found that black and Asian voters did not want to talk about policy, but took me to task for not running as Mayor. The questions of whether I could have won or not, or whether Dobson would have been a better Mayor (he would), were irrelevant to them. They wanted someone, anyone, to bid for the top table, not least to counter the drum beat of anti-asylum-seeker sentiment from our own government. Even the Left fails to grasp what is taking place here. An associate of Ken Livingstone's told The Observer last week that black people did not want to be represented by the black middle classes. He could not be more wrong. Go to any Indian community, any African-Caribbean church or any mosque and the desire to 'get on' is palpable. The talk is of 'role models' and success. That's why New Labour's failure to elevate more black and Asian people to its upper ranks carries such a sting for these communities - they want to see their own people climbing the ladder of success. This week, attention will be focused on the race to succeed Bernie Grant as Labour's candidate for Tottenham. There should be no assumption that this is a 'black' seat. Colour-coding parliamentary seats will only force excellent black candidates into being forced to compete with each other for the few seats where there are large numbers of black people. All four of those short-listed would make first-rate MPs. But several well-known black candidates were judged to be not up to the mark for a tough by-election. I doubt that there was a Blairite plot to impose a Millbank candidate. And a short list with just one white person on it could hardly be accused of being the result of racial bias. This is not, as some suppose, a lack of political will at the top. It is worse than that. The problem lies in the nature of the party itself, and we need to take a hard look at why we are failing our most committed members. Clearly, there are institutional barriers to black participation at the highest level. Paradoxically, improvements in the selection process may be raising the hurdles still higher for young and minority aspirants. The professionalisation of selection, with high-powered interviews and presentations, though improving the calibre of candidates, requires a kind of life experience denied to many from the minority communities. Would the young Bernie Grant have made it through the current process? Possibly not. Not because his views were too left-wing, but because his plain-spokenness would have been deemed too much of a risk with a hostile media pack. One member, one vote is right, but it puts a premium on having been around for long enough for local party members to know you. And the membership proved remarkably conservative in its choices. Remember, it was not the party hierarchy which knocked out so many black and Asian GLA candidates - it was the membership which voted for names with which they were familiar. I do not believe we should turn back the reforms, but I do believe that we can cope with them better. First, we can prepare people for the rigours of the political process. A new organisation, called EQ, is to be launched this week by leading Labour women and minority politicians. It will offer training and mentoring, even small grants to give them time off work, if needed. Second, the few black and Asian politicians who are there need to back each other up, rather than sniping at each other. Personally, I would never have made it through electoral maze without the support of Paul Boateng, Keith Vaz and Bernie Grant. Third, the party needs to set itself a public target. This will be hard, because it implies that some aspirants who are not black or Asian will need to put their ambitions on hold. But this is the test. Do we mean it when we say we want to be representative or not? If we do, then given that some 40-50 per cent of our vote in London is black or Asian, among our London MPs, there should be at least 25 who are not white. There is one constituency which recently mislaid its Labour MP - Brent East. Time to show the way.",

      "body": "<p>It is three-and-a-half years since Alan Greenspan issued his warning about 'irrational exuberance' in the financial markets, but it is now a commonplace that the US boom has gone on, and on, and on. </p> <p>Last week's half percentage point rise in the key Federal funds rate (to 6.5 per cent) was anticipated in market rates. In what deserves to go down as a classic exercise in hedging bets, one lone Wall Street analyst was quoted before the event as saying: 'I expect it to be 25 [basis points] but I fully expect to be wrong.' </p> <p>It was the sixth rate rise since last June, and the first time in this phase of its attempts to cool the economy that the Fed has upped the stakes from a series of gentle quarter-point rises. The Fed Open Market Committee's (FOMC) minutes for last June indicated that it expected 'an appreciable moderation in the trend' of economic growth during the second half of 1999. In fact growth (measured as the percentage change on a year earlier) rose from 3.8 per cent in the second quarter of 1999 to 4.3 per cent in the third and 4.6 per cent in the fourth. </p> <p>During that fourth quarter growth was at a staggering annualised rate of 7.3 per cent (all these figures are inflation-adjusted); and it was still 5.4 per cent (annualised) in the first quarter of this year. Such rates are significantly higher than the 3.6 per cent that the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development estimates to be the rate of growth of the US economy's productive potential. And the latter figure, which takes account of productivity gains associated with the US lead in information technology, compares with the 2.5 per cent which was reckoned to be the long-run growth rate before all the talk of a 'new paradigm' or 'new economy'. </p> <p>Although Wall Street is now somewhat below earlier peaks, the Dow is still more than 50 per cent above where it stood when Greenspan issued his warning. He must often have rued the day he gave it. </p> <p>His failure to calm market exuberance has done nothing to puncture belief in his mystical powers. If anything, he has proceeded through a process of beatification to canonisation. And in the course of both 1997 and 1998 he counteracted his own efforts to dampen exuberance by relaxing monetary policy first in reaction to the Asian financial crisis and then a year later. </p> <p>Throughout this period since 1996 the revered chairman of the US Federal Reserve has been thinking aloud in speeches and Congressional testimony about the 'new economy' and the impact of technology on America's productivity and capacity for the sustained higher economic growth that our own Gordon Brown dreams about. At first he was sceptical. Then he began to think there was something in it. But when he gave an early indication of his possible conversion, an old friend of his who telephoned to ask for the Fed data was told 'Oh, it's just hunch.' </p> <p>The hunch began to be reflected in the statistics. Productivity has improved from the low levels of recent decades. As the OECD, which acknowledges the improvement in economic performance, puts it: 'The US economy... has now been expanding continuously for longer, albeit not more rapidly, than at any time in modern history.' </p> <p>One retired international financial official who has watched Greenspan comments: 'He has been erring on the relaxed side, and mostly he's been right. The US did get handsome productivity gains. Giving growth a chance paid off very well. But you reach a point where you can't keep doing it, and I think they've reached it.' </p> <p>Unemployment in the US, at 3.9 per cent, is now below the level that many economists regard as 'full employment'. Wolf has been cried many times about the degree to which financial market valuations have parted company with the reality of even an improved US economic performance; but in the fairy tale the wolf did eventually turn up. </p> <p>And that prospect is being increasingly discussed. Both the International Monetary Fund in its recent World Economic Outlook , and the OECD in a largely favourable assessment of the US economy, have recently sounded warnings. 'New economy' or no, the problem is that some rather old fashioned imbalances have been building up, with demand in the US economy continuing to run way ahead of supply, credit being stacked up, private savings run down, and a sensational balance of payments deficit running at over 4 per cent of gross domestic product; in effect American consumers are borrowing more than $1bn a day from the rest of the world to finance their amazing appetite for imports. </p> <p>All historical experience suggests that the US cannot go on like this, yet the Fed's efforts to cool things have so far been patently ineffectual. The IMF warns that 'the process by which this widening of internal and external balances will ultimately be reversed is one of the major uncertainties facing the world economy'. The OECD says 'financial markets have anticipated future income gains and capitalised them to a very full extent', adding 'there must be some doubt whether the real net worth per share of the non-financial corporate sector can continue sufficiently rapidly to boost real earnings by around 8 per cent a year when the annual potential growth rate of the economy is only around 3.5 per cent.' </p> <p>The IMF has urged that the reversal of the US economic imbalances should be made in an orderly manner - the so-called 'soft landing'. John Llewellyn, global chief economist at Lehman Brothers, says that 'investors are currently more risk averse than at any time over the past decade' and that, in discussions, this 'fear of a hard landing of the US economy generally figures prominently'. </p> <p>Bill Martin of Phillips &amp; Drew warns: 'The larger the imbalances become, the lower the chances that policymakers will be able to steer the economy successfully.' </p> <p>A veteran Fed watcher said that, in the excessively gentle approach, Greenspan might be suffering from a little too much exuberance himself about the US economic miracle. Other members of the FOMC are said to have insisted last week on saying 'the committee is concerned that this disparity in the growth of demand and potential supply will continue, which could foster inflationary imbalances that would undermine the economy's outstanding performance.' </p> <p>The next two FOMC meetings are on 27-28 June and 22 August. By August the US will be well into the electoral convention season, and after that the Fed faces the diplomatic difficulties of the run-up to the Presidential election itself in November. </p> <p>Greenspan himself has taken to talking about the need for 'a smooth landing'. Bill Martin, noting the reaction to the Lawson boom in the UK and the Japanese bubble of the1980s, warns that 'he would be jolly lucky to secure even a soft landing'.</p>",

And the latter figure, which takes account of productivity gains associated with the US lead in information technology, compares with the 2.5 per cent which was reckoned to be the long-run growth rate before all the talk of a 'new paradigm' or 'new economy'. Although Wall Street is now somewhat below earlier peaks, the Dow is still more than 50 per cent above where it stood when Greenspan issued his warning. He must often have rued the day he gave it. His failure to calm market exuberance has done nothing to puncture belief in his mystical powers. If anything, he has proceeded through a process of beatification to canonisation. And in the course of both 1997 and 1998 he counteracted his own efforts to dampen exuberance by relaxing monetary policy first in reaction to the Asian financial crisis and then a year later. Throughout this period since 1996 the revered chairman of the US Federal Reserve has been thinking aloud in speeches and Congressional testimony about the 'new economy' and the impact of technology on America's productivity and capacity for the sustained higher economic growth that our own Gordon Brown dreams about. At first he was sceptical. Then he began to think there was something in it. But when he gave an early indication of his possible conversion, an old friend of his who telephoned to ask for the Fed data was told 'Oh, it's just hunch.' The hunch began to be reflected in the statistics. Productivity has improved from the low levels of recent decades. As the OECD, which acknowledges the improvement in economic performance, puts it: 'The US economy... has now been expanding continuously for longer, albeit not more rapidly, than at any time in modern history.' One retired international financial official who has watched Greenspan comments: 'He has been erring on the relaxed side, and mostly he's been right. The US did get handsome productivity gains. Giving growth a chance paid off very well. But you reach a point where you can't keep doing it, and I think they've reached it.' Unemployment in the US, at 3.9 per cent, is now below the level that many economists regard as 'full employment'. Wolf has been cried many times about the degree to which financial market valuations have parted company with the reality of even an improved US economic performance; but in the fairy tale the wolf did eventually turn up. And that prospect is being increasingly discussed. Both the International Monetary Fund in its recent World Economic Outlook , and the OECD in a largely favourable assessment of the US economy, have recently sounded warnings. 'New economy' or no, the problem is that some rather old fashioned imbalances have been building up, with demand in the US economy continuing to run way ahead of supply, credit being stacked up, private savings run down, and a sensational balance of payments deficit running at over 4 per cent of gross domestic product; in effect American consumers are borrowing more than $1bn a day from the rest of the world to finance their amazing appetite for imports. All historical experience suggests that the US cannot go on like this, yet the Fed's efforts to cool things have so far been patently ineffectual. The IMF warns that 'the process by which this widening of internal and external balances will ultimately be reversed is one of the major uncertainties facing the world economy'. The OECD says 'financial markets have anticipated future income gains and capitalised them to a very full extent', adding 'there must be some doubt whether the real net worth per share of the non-financial corporate sector can continue sufficiently rapidly to boost real earnings by around 8 per cent a year when the annual potential growth rate of the economy is only around 3.5 per cent.' The IMF has urged that the reversal of the US economic imbalances should be made in an orderly manner - the so-called 'soft landing'. John Llewellyn, global chief economist at Lehman Brothers, says that 'investors are currently more risk averse than at any time over the past decade' and that, in discussions, this 'fear of a hard landing of the US economy generally figures prominently'. Bill Martin of Phillips &amp; Drew warns: 'The larger the imbalances become, the lower the chances that policymakers will be able to steer the economy successfully.' A veteran Fed watcher said that, in the excessively gentle approach, Greenspan might be suffering from a little too much exuberance himself about the US economic miracle. Other members of the FOMC are said to have insisted last week on saying 'the committee is concerned that this disparity in the growth of demand and potential supply will continue, which could foster inflationary imbalances that would undermine the economy's outstanding performance.' The next two FOMC meetings are on 27-28 June and 22 August. By August the US will be well into the electoral convention season, and after that the Fed faces the diplomatic difficulties of the run-up to the Presidential election itself in November. Greenspan himself has taken to talking about the need for 'a smooth landing'. Bill Martin, noting the reaction to the Lawson boom in the UK and the Japanese bubble of the1980s, warns that 'he would be jolly lucky to secure even a soft landing'.",

It has intensified competition among the region's fishermen and dramatically accelerated the harvest of the sea's highly prized fish, the sturgeon. </p> <p>The roe of this fish, salted, is sold as caviar. 'Serve simply with toast and lemon wedges, garnished with sour cream, minced onion and hard-cooked egg whites,' say the gastronomic bibles. </p> <p>Little more than 10 years ago, fishing rights across the Caspian's 371,000 square kilometres were rigorously enforced by both Iranian and Soviet governments, and the sturgeon population was kept in healthy equilibrium. </p> <p>Pollution caused by the increase in oil and mineral excavation in the region forced the Soviet authorities temporarily to restrict the fishing of sturgeon in 1989, a move which prompted a hefty hike in the price of caviar. </p> <p>The increase was felt acutely in the US, which had imposed sanctions against Iran in 1987, so saw its supply severely limited. </p> <p>But a large-scale clean-up of the Caspian saw caviar prices return to a more realistic level by the early Nineties, where they remained for the following five years. </p> <p>However, in the middle of that decade things started to change. The dismantling of centralised control across the Caspian's Soviet states - Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Russia and Turkmenistan - meant that protecting the sea's fish stocks in the Caspian's northern waters became increasingly difficult. As the former Soviet economy collapsed, racketeers, many with links to the Russian mafia, took advantage of the chaos and started fishing the Caspian illegally, earning the epithet 'caviar pirates'. </p> <p>Today the sturgeon population in the Caspian, which provides 90 per cent of the world's caviar, has been exhausted by overfishing and the price of the roe in the West is, according to experts, close to unpayable - despite the fact that the US recently lifted sanctions against Iran. the Gulf state last year exported 90 tonnes of caviar, reducing the country's balance of payments deficit by more than \u00a320 million. </p> <p>The overfishing has in recent years prompted drastic cuts in exports to the West, in an attempt to replenish the Caspian's sturgeon stocks. Russia's Fisheries Committee announced last month that it was to cut exports of black caviar by a third this year, to around 60 tonnes. Ten days ago Iran raised the price of caviar by 40 per cent and said it would look to cut production to safeguard sturgeon stocks. In a bid to handle demand, the country's system of negotiating with caviar customers has been replaced by an auction, a move that guarantees further price hikes. </p> <p>But even the Russian and Iranian governments' predictions for caviar production seem optimistic to some observers. John Stas is managing director of WG White, one of the UK's largest caviar importers: 'This year it's likely there will be less than 100 tonnes of caviar coming out of the Caspian. Ten years ago it was something like 1,000 tonnes. Even two years ago it was producing 300 to 350 tonnes.' </p> <p>In 1999 WG White imported 10 tonnes of caviar, largely from Iran, but Stas admits his company will be lucky if it manages to bring in as much this year. </p> <p>Even if it does, it is questionable whether UK consumers will pay the prices caviar is now fetching. Traditionally the price has increased by around 5 per cent a year; but recently the industry has seen hyperinflation. </p> <p>A year ago, a kilo of beluga caviar - said by connoisseurs to be the best, and the type hardest hit by overfishing - would have cost UK gourmets \u00a31,400. Today it is a minimum \u00a32,000. Some brands fetch considerably more. Within two years, say the experts, beluga caviar will command \u00a33,000 a kilo in the UK. 'It will make the product very difficult to sell,' says Stas. 'The public will accept certain prices but we've reached the ceiling.' </p> <p>What the caviar industry refers to as the 'giveaway' sector, has collapsed. The casinos, airlines and cruise ships which traditionally offered caviar free to clients, have now balked at inflated costs. </p> <p>Environmentalists say that while the Iranian caviar 'pirates' fish from boats, many of those from the former Soviet republics use deep nets stretched across the Caspian's river deltas, a technique that greatly exacerbates depletion of sturgeon stocks. </p> <p>Jonathan Miller, provisions buyer at Fortnum &amp; Mason, says: 'Since the break up of the USSR there's been something of a free-for-all. In the old communist bloc, fishing was strictly policed, but the Russian ports aren't.' </p> <p>Iran, angry at the way it feels its Caspian neighbours have presided over the mismanagement of fishing stocks, is attempting to replenish the sturgeon population. But the migratory nature of sturgeon means this is not without problems. </p> <p>Stas says: 'There's so much illegal fishing going on in the northern part of the Caspian. The sturgeon are being caught too young. The Iranians are putting between 20 million and 30 million sturgeon back into the sea - fish that are going to be caught by the Russian fishermen.' </p> <p>Theoretically, sturgeon stocks are protected by the Geneva-based pan-national environmental agency Cites - the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. But there is only so much that Cites can do. Exporters and importers of caviar need to hold licences before they can trade, but the explosion in the trade of caviar on Eastern Europe's black market means regulation of the industry is now practically impossible. </p> <p>As caviar sells in Russia for something like a quarter of what it costs in the West, the rewards for smuggling sturgeon roe through Eastern Europe's porous border controls are huge. Each week the likes of Fortnum &amp; Mason reject several kilos of caviar from dubious sources with links to the black market. </p> <p>In a bid to compensate for the depleted Caspian stocks, France and the US have attempted to enter caviar production. Caviar from French sturgeon is, although farmed, of very good quality, but it is often even more expensive than that from its wild cousins in the East. By contrast US caviar is deemed to be far inferior to its Caspian rivals, and has struggled to attract customers outside its domestic market. </p> <p>Ironically the worldwide shortage of caviar comes as the roe, once deemed the 'food of kings' - its arrival at ancient Greek banquets was heralded by trumpets - has started to throw off its aristocratic mantle and attract a wider following. Marks &amp; Spencer now stocks it. </p> <p>Stas says: 'Maybe they should stop fishing in the Caspian for 10 years and then things could get going again. But by then caviar may have been forgotten.' </p> <p>That seems unlikely; but it is clear something must be done, and soon.

Away from his desk, he may well travel around in a chauffeur-driven limo with a TL1 number plate, leopard-skin seats and a minibar stocked with Dom P\u00e9rignon, but somehow I doubt it. Ostentation isn't Mr Laithwaite's thing. He greets visitors to Bordeaux Direct's offices in Reading in a black T-shirt and jeans; his desk is squashed into a corridor beside the company's tasting room. </p> <p>But very wealthy he most certainly is. 'I'm not sure what the business is worth, to be honest with you,' he says, with genuine nonchalance. 'Some people say \u00a3100m, some four times that, but it doesn't really matter because I'm not planning to sell it.' Whatever the true figure, Bordeaux Direct is an amazing success, one of the most profitable wine businesses in the world, with 500 employees and a turnover of \u00a3137m.

Away from his desk, he may well travel around in a chauffeur-driven limo with a TL1 number plate, leopard-skin seats and a minibar stocked with Dom P\u00e9rignon, but somehow I doubt it. Ostentation isn't Mr Laithwaite's thing. He greets visitors to Bordeaux Direct's offices in Reading in a black T-shirt and jeans; his desk is squashed into a corridor beside the company's tasting room. But very wealthy he most certainly is. 'I'm not sure what the business is worth, to be honest with you,' he says, with genuine nonchalance. 'Some people say \u00a3100m, some four times that, but it doesn't really matter because I'm not planning to sell it.' Whatever the true figure, Bordeaux Direct is an amazing success, one of the most profitable wine businesses in the world, with 500 employees and a turnover of \u00a3137m.

      "body": "<p>It is all very well for us cookery writers, chefs and other professional piggies to say that if a vegetable, a fruit or a piece of meat is not perfect, then do not buy it, but the truth is that sometimes we must buy the best we can. I mean, have you actually tried to buy a wild, straight-from-the-rod rainbow trout recently? If you have succeeded, then I am deeply envious. Famous fisherfolk such as Diana Rigg, Jeremy Paxman and, I suppose, JR Hartley, are lucky to have a fish at the end of their line, though I must say I will not be joining them. The only time I ever went fishing, I prayed I wouldn't catch anything - the thought of having to finish off a flapping, gasping trout would have been a trauma too terrible to bear. For squeamish, urban cooks like me, the choice is simple. It is farmed trout or no trout at all. </p> <p>I am not sure the trout I eat now has much to do with the rainbow-tinted ones my father used to bring home in a smelly bag from his fishing trips to Much Wenlock. (At least he said he was going fishing, although I always suspected his weekends involved something far more sinister, ending with a quick trip to MacFisheries on the way home.) His fish were wild, beautiful and had spent their life in a lake. Mine are invariably from a farm, for which read underwater factory. His trout had at least put up a bit of fight, flaying around helplessly at the end of his rod, whereas mine have probably spent their lives milling around aimlessly, wondering what to do till feeding time. </p> <p>I cannot say I do much to my trout when I get it home from the fishmonger. (The poor things are obviously destined to live a life of no excitement even to the very end.) If they are lucky, they will end their days buttered and grilled with a wedge of lemon, or perhaps sitting in a thin, sharp sauce of capers and lime. I am not being unimaginative here: trout is something that doesn't need much of a sendoff - just a hot pan and something tart to make its pink flesh sing. </p> <p>Wild trout is the fish you want. One that has had an adventure or two. But for most of us, it is the farmed fish variety, the couch potato of the fish world, or nothing. This is bland fish, make no mistake - complain all you like that trout doesn't taste like it used to, but it will get you nowhere. I am already bracing myself for a ticking off from the Trout Council or whatever body the trout farmers employ to see that we cookery writers do as we are told. But I have never had much truck with the food world's PR merchants. </p> <p>I have had some pleasing suppers this week, however, and four of them involved a trout. There was a baked fish, naked except for a tuft or two of tarragon and a shake of tarragon vinegar. Then there was a salad for which I fried the fish and marinated it with coriander and vinegar; a couple of fillets grilled with lime and scattered with capers, and then a whole fish cooked in its own steam with lemon grass. Do you see a pattern here? You need a snap of piquancy. Throw the cream out of the window and you will eat well enough. Lime, capers, vinegar, lemon grass all have some sort of acidity that, like passion fruit with lacklustre strawberries, breathe life into the dish. </p> <p>On the positive side, trout is high in the omega 3 fatty acids that are so important for guarding against heart disease, it is easily available - with even the simplest supermarket running to a pre-packed version - and it is almost the cheapest fish you can buy. The trout is as happy steamed as baked, and is generally juicy. It smokes delectably and can be used in any of the thousands of recipes you can find for salmon. On the downside, they can taste like mud. Much will depend on the farm your fish has come from, on what it has been fed and how fresh it is. Look for something that is stiff and shimmering, with red gills and twinkling eyes. But it is unlikely to sport the exquisite blue, brown, grey and pink colouring we associate with the wild fish. </p> <p>It wasn't so long ago that the most famous fish dish, trout with almonds, was a luxury. Then again, so were grapes, Camembert and After Eight mints. But that expensive fish with its gilding of thinly sliced nuts was more often than not straight from the deep freeze. I know this much because I spent most of my teenage years fishing bistro classics out of freezers to put on restaurant plates. I do think this is a recipe worth doing, though, especially if you take the trouble (and it is trouble) to skin and slice the almonds yourself and use the sweetest, freshest butter. </p> <p>No matter how much olive oil has taken over from dairy produce in the modern kitchen, it doesn't do much for salmon and trout. Those who seek to impose olive oil on the oilier fish (ie, almost every restaurant in town) seem to have misunderstood that its flesh is already awash with oil - which is why trout tastes so much better when sizzled in a pan with butter till it turns nutty-smelling and brown and, I imagine, even better if that pan is perched on a camping stove by the side of a lake. </p> <p><strong> Warm marinated trout with butter sauce</strong></p> <p> The idea of marinating the trout is both to flavour it and keep it juicy. The marinade is then boiled down and finished with butter. This is not a dish that will hold and wait, as the sauce will split. Do it when there are just two of you and you are ready to eat. Some new potatoes, scrubbed and buttered would be nice here. Serves 2. </p> <p>2 trout, filleted </p> <p>150ml white wine vinegar </p> <p>4 tbsps mild olive oil </p> <p>1 small onion, peeled and very thinly sliced </p> <p>1 dried chilli, roughly crushed </p> <p>1 tsp of coriander seeds, lightly crushed </p> <p>a bay leaf or two </p> <p>a thick slice of butter for frying the fish </p> <p><strong> to finish the sauce</strong> </p> <p>50g cold butter, cut into small chunks </p> <p>Pour the vinegar into a shallow glass, china or stainless-steel dish, add the olive oil, the onion, the chilli and the coriander seeds. Crumble the bay leaves into the dish. </p> <p>Rinse the trout and dry it on kitchen paper, then lay it, skin-side up, in the dish. If the marinade doesn't quite cover the fish, add more vinegar and oil. Roughly crush a few peppercorns and scatter them over, then cover with clingfilm or a plate and set aside somewhere cool for at least an hour. </p> <p>Melt the butter in a shallow pan and when it starts to froth, slide in the trout fillets, skin-side up. After a minute or two, carefully turn the fillets, cover the pan with a lid and continue cooking until the flesh is tinged with golden brown - a matter of three or four minutes. </p> <p>Lift the fish out and keep warm in a low oven. Pour off most of the butter left in the pan, then add the marinade, holding back the onions and chilli with a draining spoon. Let it bubble over a very high heat until it has reduced to a few spoonfuls, now beat in the second lot of butter with a whisk until the sauce is glossy, then spoon it over the fish (there won't be much), and serve. </p> <p> <strong> Trout with prosciutto and sage</strong> </p> <p> I suspect it is more than my life is worth to give you a veal recipe, so here is Veal Saltimbocca made with trout. It tastes much better than it sounds because of the trout's curious affinity with bacon. Serves 2. </p> <p>75g cold butter </p> <p>4 large slices of Parma ham </p> <p>2 large trout, filleted </p> <p>4 large sage leaves </p> <p>a little plain flour </p> <p>groundnut oil, for frying </p> <p>juice of a lemon </p> <p>Cut the butter in two, and cut one half into four thin slices. Lay a slice of ham flat on the table, place a slice of butter in the middle, then put one of the trout fillets on top. Roll up the fish in the ham, place a sage leaf over the loose end, and secure with a cocktail stick. </p> <p>Season the flour with salt and pepper. Heat a thin layer of oil in a frying pan. Dust each fish parcel thoroughly with flour. Place, butter-side down, in the pan and cook for about three minutes, till the ham is crisp. Turn over with the help of a fish slice and cook for a further two minutes. </p> <p>Remove the fish to a hot plate. Tip the juices from the pan. Melt the remaining butter over a high heat, and as soon as it starts to froth, add the lemon juice and a little salt and pepper. Pour the frothing butter over the fish and serve immediately. </p> <p> <strong> Pan-fried trout</strong> </p> <p> A meal of such simplicity you wonder why you don't do it more often. Serves 2. </p> <p>50g butter </p> <p>2 large trout, filleted </p> <p>a small handful of chopped parsley </p> <p>2 tbsps chopped tarragon, dill or flat leaf parsley </p> <p>juice of half a lemon </p> <p>Heat the butter in a large, shallow pan over a moderate heat. When the butter starts to froth and bubble, put in the fillets, skin-side down. Cook until the skin is golden, spooning the hot butter over the fish from time to time. It should take about seven to eight minutes to cook the fish through, depending on their size. Remove the fish to warm plates. Add the herbs to the butter, squeeze in the lemon juice, and pour over the fish. </p> <p>\u0095 To order a copy of Nigel Slater's Real Food for \u00a39.99 including p&amp;p (rrp \u00a312.99), freephone 0800 316 8171 </p>",

I mean, have you actually tried to buy a wild, straight-from-the-rod rainbow trout recently? If you have succeeded, then I am deeply envious. Famous fisherfolk such as Diana Rigg, Jeremy Paxman and, I suppose, JR Hartley, are lucky to have a fish at the end of their line, though I must say I will not be joining them. The only time I ever went fishing, I prayed I wouldn't catch anything - the thought of having to finish off a flapping, gasping trout would have been a trauma too terrible to bear. For squeamish, urban cooks like me, the choice is simple. It is farmed trout or no trout at all. I am not sure the trout I eat now has much to do with the rainbow-tinted ones my father used to bring home in a smelly bag from his fishing trips to Much Wenlock. (At least he said he was going fishing, although I always suspected his weekends involved something far more sinister, ending with a quick trip to MacFisheries on the way home.) His fish were wild, beautiful and had spent their life in a lake. Mine are invariably from a farm, for which read underwater factory. His trout had at least put up a bit of fight, flaying around helplessly at the end of his rod, whereas mine have probably spent their lives milling around aimlessly, wondering what to do till feeding time. I cannot say I do much to my trout when I get it home from the fishmonger. (The poor things are obviously destined to live a life of no excitement even to the very end.) If they are lucky, they will end their days buttered and grilled with a wedge of lemon, or perhaps sitting in a thin, sharp sauce of capers and lime. I am not being unimaginative here: trout is something that doesn't need much of a sendoff - just a hot pan and something tart to make its pink flesh sing. Wild trout is the fish you want. One that has had an adventure or two. But for most of us, it is the farmed fish variety, the couch potato of the fish world, or nothing. This is bland fish, make no mistake - complain all you like that trout doesn't taste like it used to, but it will get you nowhere. I am already bracing myself for a ticking off from the Trout Council or whatever body the trout farmers employ to see that we cookery writers do as we are told. But I have never had much truck with the food world's PR merchants. I have had some pleasing suppers this week, however, and four of them involved a trout. There was a baked fish, naked except for a tuft or two of tarragon and a shake of tarragon vinegar. Then there was a salad for which I fried the fish and marinated it with coriander and vinegar; a couple of fillets grilled with lime and scattered with capers, and then a whole fish cooked in its own steam with lemon grass. Do you see a pattern here? You need a snap of piquancy. Throw the cream out of the window and you will eat well enough. Lime, capers, vinegar, lemon grass all have some sort of acidity that, like passion fruit with lacklustre strawberries, breathe life into the dish. On the positive side, trout is high in the omega 3 fatty acids that are so important for guarding against heart disease, it is easily available - with even the simplest supermarket running to a pre-packed version - and it is almost the cheapest fish you can buy. The trout is as happy steamed as baked, and is generally juicy. It smokes delectably and can be used in any of the thousands of recipes you can find for salmon. On the downside, they can taste like mud. Much will depend on the farm your fish has come from, on what it has been fed and how fresh it is. Look for something that is stiff and shimmering, with red gills and twinkling eyes. But it is unlikely to sport the exquisite blue, brown, grey and pink colouring we associate with the wild fish. It wasn't so long ago that the most famous fish dish, trout with almonds, was a luxury. Then again, so were grapes, Camembert and After Eight mints. But that expensive fish with its gilding of thinly sliced nuts was more often than not straight from the deep freeze. I know this much because I spent most of my teenage years fishing bistro classics out of freezers to put on restaurant plates. I do think this is a recipe worth doing, though, especially if you take the trouble (and it is trouble) to skin and slice the almonds yourself and use the sweetest, freshest butter. No matter how much olive oil has taken over from dairy produce in the modern kitchen, it doesn't do much for salmon and trout. Those who seek to impose olive oil on the oilier fish (ie, almost every restaurant in town) seem to have misunderstood that its flesh is already awash with oil - which is why trout tastes so much better when sizzled in a pan with butter till it turns nutty-smelling and brown and, I imagine, even better if that pan is perched on a camping stove by the side of a lake. Warm marinated trout with butter sauce The idea of marinating the trout is both to flavour it and keep it juicy. The marinade is then boiled down and finished with butter. This is not a dish that will hold and wait, as the sauce will split. Do it when there are just two of you and you are ready to eat. Some new potatoes, scrubbed and buttered would be nice here. Serves 2. 2 trout, filleted 150ml white wine vinegar 4 tbsps mild olive oil 1 small onion, peeled and very thinly sliced 1 dried chilli, roughly crushed 1 tsp of coriander seeds, lightly crushed a bay leaf or two a thick slice of butter for frying the fish to finish the sauce 50g cold butter, cut into small chunks Pour the vinegar into a shallow glass, china or stainless-steel dish, add the olive oil, the onion, the chilli and the coriander seeds. Crumble the bay leaves into the dish. Rinse the trout and dry it on kitchen paper, then lay it, skin-side up, in the dish. If the marinade doesn't quite cover the fish, add more vinegar and oil. Roughly crush a few peppercorns and scatter them over, then cover with clingfilm or a plate and set aside somewhere cool for at least an hour. Melt the butter in a shallow pan and when it starts to froth, slide in the trout fillets, skin-side up. After a minute or two, carefully turn the fillets, cover the pan with a lid and continue cooking until the flesh is tinged with golden brown - a matter of three or four minutes. Lift the fish out and keep warm in a low oven. Pour off most of the butter left in the pan, then add the marinade, holding back the onions and chilli with a draining spoon. Let it bubble over a very high heat until it has reduced to a few spoonfuls, now beat in the second lot of butter with a whisk until the sauce is glossy, then spoon it over the fish (there won't be much), and serve. Trout with prosciutto and sage I suspect it is more than my life is worth to give you a veal recipe, so here is Veal Saltimbocca made with trout. It tastes much better than it sounds because of the trout's curious affinity with bacon. Serves 2. 75g cold butter 4 large slices of Parma ham 2 large trout, filleted 4 large sage leaves a little plain flour groundnut oil, for frying juice of a lemon Cut the butter in two, and cut one half into four thin slices. Lay a slice of ham flat on the table, place a slice of butter in the middle, then put one of the trout fillets on top. Roll up the fish in the ham, place a sage leaf over the loose end, and secure with a cocktail stick. Season the flour with salt and pepper. Heat a thin layer of oil in a frying pan. Dust each fish parcel thoroughly with flour. Place, butter-side down, in the pan and cook for about three minutes, till the ham is crisp. Turn over with the help of a fish slice and cook for a further two minutes. Remove the fish to a hot plate. Tip the juices from the pan. Melt the remaining butter over a high heat, and as soon as it starts to froth, add the lemon juice and a little salt and pepper. Pour the frothing butter over the fish and serve immediately. Pan-fried trout A meal of such simplicity you wonder why you don't do it more often. Serves 2. 50g butter 2 large trout, filleted a small handful of chopped parsley 2 tbsps chopped tarragon, dill or flat leaf parsley juice of half a lemon Heat the butter in a large, shallow pan over a moderate heat. When the butter starts to froth and bubble, put in the fillets, skin-side down. Cook until the skin is golden, spooning the hot butter over the fish from time to time. It should take about seven to eight minutes to cook the fish through, depending on their size. Remove the fish to warm plates. Add the herbs to the butter, squeeze in the lemon juice, and pour over the fish. \u0095 To order a copy of Nigel Slater's Real Food for \u00a39.99 including p&amp;p (rrp \u00a312.99), freephone 0800 316 8171",

Speight was reported to have threatened to kill him unless he called President Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara to order the military away from the parliament. Fiji TV reported that Chaudhry - Fiji's first ethnic Indian Prime Minister - told Speight to go ahead and shoot.</p> <p>The President warned Speight and his band that he would not bow to threats. 'We wish to see the impasse broken and the captives set free, but we will not bow to threats and coercion,' Kamisese said.</p> <p>It remained unclear how much support Speight had within Fiji. At a news conference, the military and police pledged their backing for Kamisese, who declared a state of emergency on Friday.</p> <p>All leave was cancelled and troops summoned back to barracks. The fact that police and the military have not risen with Speight against the government was taken as a strong indication that the coup is doomed even if the use of force is avoided.</p> <p>Suva itself was recovering after two days of rioting and looting by native Fijians. Scores of businesses have been sacked and destroyed.</p> <p>The rioters were incensed by Chaudhry's attempts to persuade Fijian landowners to renew expiring leases on farmland held by thousands of ethnic Indians. Chaudhry's year-old administration is the first to be dominated by Fijian Indians, which has angered some indigenous islanders. Fijian Indians account for 45 per cent of the population and indigenous Fijians 50 per cent.</p> <p>There were also reports of fresh violence in Fiji's second city, Nadi, a major holiday destination and the location of the country's main international airport.</p> <p>Tourism is Fiji's chief industry, accounting for 17 per cent of GDP. Any impact on it would severely damage the fragile economy of a country which attracts 300,000 foreign visitors each year.</p>",

Fiji TV reported that Chaudhry - Fiji's first ethnic Indian Prime Minister - told Speight to go ahead and shoot. The President warned Speight and his band that he would not bow to threats. 'We wish to see the impasse broken and the captives set free, but we will not bow to threats and coercion,' Kamisese said. It remained unclear how much support Speight had within Fiji. At a news conference, the military and police pledged their backing for Kamisese, who declared a state of emergency on Friday. All leave was cancelled and troops summoned back to barracks. The fact that police and the military have not risen with Speight against the government was taken as a strong indication that the coup is doomed even if the use of force is avoided. Suva itself was recovering after two days of rioting and looting by native Fijians. Scores of businesses have been sacked and destroyed. The rioters were incensed by Chaudhry's attempts to persuade Fijian landowners to renew expiring leases on farmland held by thousands of ethnic Indians. Chaudhry's year-old administration is the first to be dominated by Fijian Indians, which has angered some indigenous islanders. Fijian Indians account for 45 per cent of the population and indigenous Fijians 50 per cent. There were also reports of fresh violence in Fiji's second city, Nadi, a major holiday destination and the location of the country's main international airport. Tourism is Fiji's chief industry, accounting for 17 per cent of GDP. Any impact on it would severely damage the fragile economy of a country which attracts 300,000 foreign visitors each year.",

'He said: \"Bloody hell. We don't even have cheese like that at home when we have a posh dinner party. Get rid of it\",' one senior BBC official said. </p> <p>Dyke 'could not understand why \"luxury and country range biscuits\" cost 55p each,' one BBC source said. He derided 'Rustico Bloomer' and 'Italian Baguettes' at \u00a317.95 and \u00a318 each. </p> <p>Dyke's decrees have been dismissed as daft penny-pinching by staff. 'When John Birt ran the show there was always cheese - and biscuits - and croissants at meetings,' one said. 'What's next? Will we soon be forced to bring in Thermos flasks of lukewarm team and garibaldis wrapped in tin foil to keep us going?' </p> <p>Not all staff have been forced to reacquaint themselves with greasy spoon eateries, however.

      "bodyText": "It is dubbed the 'Dyke diet' - a slimmed-down regime to keep the BBC, and its staff, lean and mean. After banning croissants and taxis, and encouraging employees to walk or cycle to work, Greg Dyke has taken cheese, 'luxury biscuits' and 'international bread' off the menu, say insiders. The new director general, who once scrawled 'haven't you heard of sandwiches?' on one extravagant journalist's expense claim, is said to be outraged that the BBC's catering and hospitality budget has ballooned. At a recent boardroom dinner, BBC sources say, Dyke's jaw dropped when waiters brought in a huge cheeseboard. 'He said: \"Bloody hell. We don't even have cheese like that at home when we have a posh dinner party. Get rid of it\",' one senior BBC official said. Dyke 'could not understand why \"luxury and country range biscuits\" cost 55p each,' one BBC source said. He derided 'Rustico Bloomer' and 'Italian Baguettes' at \u00a317.95 and \u00a318 each. Dyke's decrees have been dismissed as daft penny-pinching by staff. 'When John Birt ran the show there was always cheese - and biscuits - and croissants at meetings,' one said. 'What's next? Will we soon be forced to bring in Thermos flasks of lukewarm team and garibaldis wrapped in tin foil to keep us going?' Not all staff have been forced to reacquaint themselves with greasy spoon eateries, however. Senior news executives have special permission to woo new recruits - such as political editor Andrew Marr- at the \u00a350-a-head River Caf\u00e9 and the pricey Halcyon Hotel in Holland Park.",

Will there be terry-towelling nappies permanently on the washing line for the benefit of the eco-friendly paparazzi and a cellarful of disposable nappies? And what do you bet, bottle or breast?</p> <p>For weeks to come, we'll all be going natal, until the nation screams for a break. It's tough on us but far tougher on Cherie. We'll be watching her - and judging. In the run-up to the general election, how the public reacts to bringing up baby will matter a great deal.</p> <p>Cherie Booth's achievement so far is that, as a feminist, she has managed to adapt the traditional role of Prime Minister's wife to allow a degree of independence, carefully choosing when to step out of her husband's shadow - for instance, on domestic violence or parental leave. The politics of motherhood may be an altogether trickier game: every decision she makes will turn a floodlight on the poverty of options available to others.</p> <p>'It's about choice,' says Harriet Harman who, as a backbench MP, has pushed hard for improved parental rights. 'The decisions that Cherie Booth makes should be treated as a demonstration of the right of every woman to exercise a similar amount of freedom with sufficient financial support.'</p> <p>Cherie Booth depends greatly on money. A working-class girl made good, she has plenty of it and can buy the very best care. But the cost of childcare makes poor men and women of even the residents of Middle England.</p> <p>Leo Blair's arrival coincides with the start of National Childcare Week. Childcare has become a central plank of New Labour's attempt to create a New Britain, in which most are expected to work. A national childcare strategy has been launched; a review of maternity rights and benefits is due; the Working Family Tax Credit and the Childcare Credit have given, on average, \u00a330 a week for childcare to 100,000 low-income families.</p> <p>But according to a Mori poll published tomorrow and commissioned by the Daycare Trust, 75 per cent of the public does not believe working mothers have sufficient access to affordable childcare and almost half say employers do not do enough to support mothers returning to work.</p> <p>If Cherie didn't have cause to consider the question before, she may now. She's shown herself to be too committed to social justice not to care and too canny not to recognise how she can exercise a lever for change. So, in the first year of her baby's life, what personal choices and public pronouncements might she make? Will she stay quiet or will she become not just the champion of parental leave but a protagonist for the right of all children to have the very best beginnings?</p> <p>Cherie is self-employed and allegedly earning \u00a3150,000 or more a year. If she was an employee without additional contractual rights, she would be entitled to 18 weeks paid maternity allowance; six weeks at 90 per cent of her wage, the rest at only \u00a360.20 a week - a sum which has halved in value since 1964. It doesn't take a review to know that maternity pay in Britain is too low, too limited and too bureaucratic.</p> <p>Harriet Harman has come up with a 15-point plan which concentrates particularly on a baby's first 12 months. She suggests maternity leave is extended from six to 12 months and the right to return to a job part-time. In addition, she is calling for grants to small employers to encourage them to accept this proposal; increased benefits to low-income families and a baby tax credit to help with the expense of childcare for the very young, or to enable a parent to remain at home for the first year.</p> <p>The Blairs have already announced that Cherie's mother will initially take care of the baby. This could not be more core Labour. According to research, only 18 per cent of professionals use relatives to look after their children; in contrast 44 per cent of the manual classes rely on granny, aunts and sisters.</p> <p>At a later stage, perhaps to allow Baby Blair to have some life outside Numbers 10 and 11, a nursery might be considered. It is at this point that Cherie will learn that across Britain, there is a desperate shortage of baby places, no matter how much money the parents have to offer. It is even tougher for those groups New Labour has pledged to assist most.</p> <p>'If you are a low-income earner living in a disadvantaged area, the chances of finding your baby a nursery are as likely as getting him into Eton,' says Colette Kelleher of the Daycare Centre.</p> <p>Even where there is provision, problems exist. At present, half the staff in the childcare industry are unqualified; turnover is high; motivation poor; training inadequate. Who works hard for a BA in childhood studies, only to be offered \u00a34 an hour in a nursery? Of course, good-quality nurseries and highly skilled nannies exist but even as the expensive private sector expands, so the affordable subsidised public sector is being squeezed. Out of 6,000 nurseries, for instance, there are only 250 which are non-profit-making.</p> <p>Cherie is returning to work in September as one of 22 barristers in the newly created Matrix Chambers, dealing primarily with human rights issues. She returned even more rapidly after the birth of her first three children. 'She is,' says Harman, 'unfazed and without guilt on the issue. We should respect her choice.'</p> <p>Only 5 per cent of employers contribute towards childcare costs; 5 per cent offer a workplace nursery and 2 per cent have reserved nursery places - figures which have remained unchanged since New Labour came to power. The government's 'light touch' has patently failed. Cherie therefore might decide to support those who advocate stronger government pressure so British bosses, like their European counterparts, treat childcare not as a 'perk' but an employment right.</p> <p>Cherie Booth has always rationed her public utterances, maximising her impact when she does choose to speak. In the lull before the party conferences, she may give her first post-birth interview in which she makes the case for improved benefits; better maternity leave; high quality affordable childcare; paid parental leave and more input from employers.</p> <p>The Daily Mail may consider tearing her to shreds but, before it does, it should take a readers' poll. This would reveal Cherie speaks with the voice of Mother Middle England.</p> <p>A year after the arrival of Baby Leo, it may be the Tories who end up with the baby blues.</p>",

      "bodyText": "So, what's it to be? Cashmere baby leggings by Clements Ribiera or Baby Gap and M&amp;S? Will there be terry-towelling nappies permanently on the washing line for the benefit of the eco-friendly paparazzi and a cellarful of disposable nappies? And what do you bet, bottle or breast? For weeks to come, we'll all be going natal, until the nation screams for a break. It's tough on us but far tougher on Cherie. We'll be watching her - and judging. In the run-up to the general election, how the public reacts to bringing up baby will matter a great deal. Cherie Booth's achievement so far is that, as a feminist, she has managed to adapt the traditional role of Prime Minister's wife to allow a degree of independence, carefully choosing when to step out of her husband's shadow - for instance, on domestic violence or parental leave. The politics of motherhood may be an altogether trickier game: every decision she makes will turn a floodlight on the poverty of options available to others. 'It's about choice,' says Harriet Harman who, as a backbench MP, has pushed hard for improved parental rights. 'The decisions that Cherie Booth makes should be treated as a demonstration of the right of every woman to exercise a similar amount of freedom with sufficient financial support.' Cherie Booth depends greatly on money. A working-class girl made good, she has plenty of it and can buy the very best care. But the cost of childcare makes poor men and women of even the residents of Middle England. Leo Blair's arrival coincides with the start of National Childcare Week. Childcare has become a central plank of New Labour's attempt to create a New Britain, in which most are expected to work. A national childcare strategy has been launched; a review of maternity rights and benefits is due; the Working Family Tax Credit and the Childcare Credit have given, on average, \u00a330 a week for childcare to 100,000 low-income families. But according to a Mori poll published tomorrow and commissioned by the Daycare Trust, 75 per cent of the public does not believe working mothers have sufficient access to affordable childcare and almost half say employers do not do enough to support mothers returning to work. If Cherie didn't have cause to consider the question before, she may now. She's shown herself to be too committed to social justice not to care and too canny not to recognise how she can exercise a lever for change. So, in the first year of her baby's life, what personal choices and public pronouncements might she make? Will she stay quiet or will she become not just the champion of parental leave but a protagonist for the right of all children to have the very best beginnings? Cherie is self-employed and allegedly earning \u00a3150,000 or more a year. If she was an employee without additional contractual rights, she would be entitled to 18 weeks paid maternity allowance; six weeks at 90 per cent of her wage, the rest at only \u00a360.20 a week - a sum which has halved in value since 1964. It doesn't take a review to know that maternity pay in Britain is too low, too limited and too bureaucratic. Harriet Harman has come up with a 15-point plan which concentrates particularly on a baby's first 12 months. She suggests maternity leave is extended from six to 12 months and the right to return to a job part-time. In addition, she is calling for grants to small employers to encourage them to accept this proposal; increased benefits to low-income families and a baby tax credit to help with the expense of childcare for the very young, or to enable a parent to remain at home for the first year. The Blairs have already announced that Cherie's mother will initially take care of the baby. This could not be more core Labour. According to research, only 18 per cent of professionals use relatives to look after their children; in contrast 44 per cent of the manual classes rely on granny, aunts and sisters. At a later stage, perhaps to allow Baby Blair to have some life outside Numbers 10 and 11, a nursery might be considered. It is at this point that Cherie will learn that across Britain, there is a desperate shortage of baby places, no matter how much money the parents have to offer. It is even tougher for those groups New Labour has pledged to assist most. 'If you are a low-income earner living in a disadvantaged area, the chances of finding your baby a nursery are as likely as getting him into Eton,' says Colette Kelleher of the Daycare Centre. Even where there is provision, problems exist. At present, half the staff in the childcare industry are unqualified; turnover is high; motivation poor; training inadequate. Who works hard for a BA in childhood studies, only to be offered \u00a34 an hour in a nursery? Of course, good-quality nurseries and highly skilled nannies exist but even as the expensive private sector expands, so the affordable subsidised public sector is being squeezed. Out of 6,000 nurseries, for instance, there are only 250 which are non-profit-making. Cherie is returning to work in September as one of 22 barristers in the newly created Matrix Chambers, dealing primarily with human rights issues. She returned even more rapidly after the birth of her first three children. 'She is,' says Harman, 'unfazed and without guilt on the issue. We should respect her choice.' Only 5 per cent of employers contribute towards childcare costs; 5 per cent offer a workplace nursery and 2 per cent have reserved nursery places - figures which have remained unchanged since New Labour came to power. The government's 'light touch' has patently failed. Cherie therefore might decide to support those who advocate stronger government pressure so British bosses, like their European counterparts, treat childcare not as a 'perk' but an employment right. Cherie Booth has always rationed her public utterances, maximising her impact when she does choose to speak. In the lull before the party conferences, she may give her first post-birth interview in which she makes the case for improved benefits; better maternity leave; high quality affordable childcare; paid parental leave and more input from employers. The Daily Mail may consider tearing her to shreds but, before it does, it should take a readers' poll. This would reveal Cherie speaks with the voice of Mother Middle England. A year after the arrival of Baby Leo, it may be the Tories who end up with the baby blues.",

And the man who is arguably the Prime Minister's most dangerous rival is also without an heir: Gordon Brown remains a steadfast bachelor. I think it does make a difference to the party battle. When Hague, Portillo and Widdecombe talk about the importance of family, they may speak with sincerity and conviction, but they can talk only in the abstract. It's not real life for them. That registers with the electoral audience. Tony Blair will find it easier to convince voters that he empathises with the fears of parents for their children's health and education when he's got hands-on experience of both the joys and the messy end of child-rearing. Literally so, if he keeps his promise to Cherie to do the middle-of-the-night nappies. And even if all this doesn't produce a baby bouncer in the polls, there is one undeniable advantage to Tony Blair as he runs up to the next election campaign. He will be the first Prime Minister of the television age to have his own baby to kiss.",

A Downing Street spokesman explained, succinctly, 'Cherie is knackered.'</p> <p>William Hague was soon in touch, saying 'Ffion and I were delighted to hear of the birth ... and we send our congratulations to them and their children.' Hillary Clinton telephoned Cherie yesterday afternoon, and Bill Clinton is said to be 'delighted'.</p> <p>Flowers went through the Downing Street gates from, among others, Cherie's law chambers, the Booth family - father Tony later said, 'I was telephoned in the early hours to be given this wonderful news. I know both his parents and brothers and sister are completely besotted with him. The most important thing is that Cherie and the baby are well' - and from Lord Chancellor Derry Irvine. At about noon, a large bouquet arrived from the Queen and Prince Philip.</p> <p>At least, we think it was. 'Can't tell you who that was from, mate,' winked the Royal Mail driver as he waited to turn back into the Whitehall traffic. 'But put it this way ... someone important. More important even than ...' and a nod back to Downing Street.</p> <p>But is she? The small crowds waiting by the gates, the vast bulk of whom were passing tourists, were split over whether a Blair birth was as important as a royal birth. 'Absolutely,' said Sharon McLennan, from Vancouver. 'Who cares about the royals any more... this family are at least real people.' But 'he's just a politician,' countered the Tallis family, down from Yorkshire for the day in London and frankly more interested in their view of the London Eye than in Downing Street. 'What a happy day for them, of course, but we really don't care that much. And you lot should leave that baby alone.'</p> <p>Nearby, an elderly mother and daughter passed, supremely missing the point by pointing out to each other that 'that's where Mrs Thatcher used to live'.</p>",

There was no suggestion that it would agree to frantic photographers' requests yesterday to 'at least hold the baby up to the window'. A Downing Street spokesman explained, succinctly, 'Cherie is knackered.' William Hague was soon in touch, saying 'Ffion and I were delighted to hear of the birth ... and we send our congratulations to them and their children.' Hillary Clinton telephoned Cherie yesterday afternoon, and Bill Clinton is said to be 'delighted'. Flowers went through the Downing Street gates from, among others, Cherie's law chambers, the Booth family - father Tony later said, 'I was telephoned in the early hours to be given this wonderful news. I know both his parents and brothers and sister are completely besotted with him. The most important thing is that Cherie and the baby are well' - and from Lord Chancellor Derry Irvine. At about noon, a large bouquet arrived from the Queen and Prince Philip. At least, we think it was. 'Can't tell you who that was from, mate,' winked the Royal Mail driver as he waited to turn back into the Whitehall traffic. 'But put it this way ... someone important. More important even than ...' and a nod back to Downing Street. But is she? The small crowds waiting by the gates, the vast bulk of whom were passing tourists, were split over whether a Blair birth was as important as a royal birth. 'Absolutely,' said Sharon McLennan, from Vancouver. 'Who cares about the royals any more... this family are at least real people.' But 'he's just a politician,' countered the Tallis family, down from Yorkshire for the day in London and frankly more interested in their view of the London Eye than in Downing Street. 'What a happy day for them, of course, but we really don't care that much. And you lot should leave that baby alone.' Nearby, an elderly mother and daughter passed, supremely missing the point by pointing out to each other that 'that's where Mrs Thatcher used to live'.",

When Harold Wilson attacked the Loyalist strikers as 'spongers' in 1974 he was echoing, less eloquently, what John Milton said more than 300 years earlier - and what many Englishmen vaguely feel to this day. The Ulster settlers were Scotch 'thieves and red-shanks', Milton said, who had been 'neighbourly admitted ... by the courtesy of England, to hold possessions in our province, a country better than their own', and in return had 'with worse faith than the heathen, proved ungrateful and treacherous guests to their best friends'.</p> <p>It doesn't seem far from there to the Downing Street Declaration of 1994, which said, truthfully enough, that the British had no selfish strategic or economic interest in Northern Ireland, which begged to be completed with 'so please let us find a way of getting out'.</p> <p>At much the same time Sir Patrick Mayhew told Die Zeit that the British would leave Ulster 'mit dem Handkuss' - with pleasure - if they could. This is one truth that David Trimble has grasped. Any unionist argument from history is certainly poor: the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland didn't exist 200 years ago, and in its full form lasted for no more than 120 years. The only thing feebler is the historical argument for a United Ireland, given that no independent Irish state ever existed before 1922, and that Ireland has never been politically united in its history, except under the English Crown.</p> <p>Maybe the southern Irish dimly recognise that. For generations the Irish state made an irredentist claim on Northern Ireland, embodied in Articles 2 and 3 of the constitution. In reality, 'the national question' played a most distinctive role in Irish political life: reunification was a goal which must always be pursued, but must never be achieved.</p> <p>Not least, the Irish knew that partition had been highly convenient for them. By exporting sectarian conflict to the North, it was the essential factor which made possible the creation of a stable and peaceful Irish state. It isn't really surprising to anyone who knows Ireland that in a poll not long ago, a mere 21 per cent of Irish said they were 'very interested' in reunifcation. And seven years ago a still more pointed question was asked: in order to achieve a united Ireland, would they would be prepared to pay any more taxes? All of 19 per cent of Irish polled said they were.</p> <p>Is this, as Borges's said, two bald men fighting over a comb? The truth is, no one wants Northern Ireland. With all their noisy violence, republican and loyalist zealots are hooligans at a match neither side wants to win.</p> <p>Least understood is the position of the Ulster Protestants. Occasionally someone asks why we call them loyalists 'when they don't seem very loyal'. The answer is that not only is 'loyalist' a misnomer, so is 'unionist'. Partition and the Stormont statelet was not a 'unionist' outcome for Northern Ireland: the only part of Ireland which hadn't wanted home rule was the only part to get it. But before long the Ulstermen had come to like Stormont too well, and by the late Thirties, 'Back to Westminster' - the dream of integration which beguiled many, was rejected by the Ulster Unionist Council.</p> <p>The real nature of 'unionism' was shown by one of the least known, and most extraordinary, episodes in Ulster history. In the spring of 1945, Sir Basil Brooke's unionist junta at Stormont called an early Northern Ireland general election. No sooner had the unionists won a landslide than the Stormont cabinet discussed whether the time was ripe to demand Dominion status from Westminster. When one Minister reminded his colleagues of the huge subsidies Northern Ireland enjoyed from the British Treasury, they backtracked.</p> <p>What this says is riveting. Had Northern Ireland become a Dominion, Brooke could have still have used the 'British' rhetoric of Crown and Empire. But he would have been governing a country as effectively independent as Canada and Australia, not to say as De Valera's Ireland. In other words, what was unionism was really Ulster nationalism - and so it remains. Henry McDonald's biography of David Trimble is revealing in this respect. In 1974 Trimble was arguing that 'independence may be the only alternative to a united Ireland', and he continued to advocate Dominion status until the late Eighties.</p> <p>Maybe Trimble is right. If the British don't want Northern Ireland, and the Irish don't want it either, then logic points to a separate Northern Ireland. A sovereign Ulster would be quite as large in area and population as - and much larger in domestic product than - many United Nations member states. It would have to find a way for its two communities to live together, and it would have to stand on its own feet economically. For years, we have been told that there is no alternative to the Belfast Agreement, there is no 'plan B'. Perhaps we should start looking for plan C.</p>",

In other words, what was unionism was really Ulster nationalism - and so it remains. Henry McDonald's biography of David Trimble is revealing in this respect. In 1974 Trimble was arguing that 'independence may be the only alternative to a united Ireland', and he continued to advocate Dominion status until the late Eighties. Maybe Trimble is right. If the British don't want Northern Ireland, and the Irish don't want it either, then logic points to a separate Northern Ireland. A sovereign Ulster would be quite as large in area and population as - and much larger in domestic product than - many United Nations member states. It would have to find a way for its two communities to live together, and it would have to stand on its own feet economically. For years, we have been told that there is no alternative to the Belfast Agreement, there is no 'plan B'. Perhaps we should start looking for plan C.",

We had feared you might be born a few hours earlier and give the Saturday papers the fun of reporting your arrival and speculating on the coming upheavals to the lives of your illustrious parents. But your timing was perfect (and we like your name). Babies change things. Their uncompromising demands usually affect just their families. But sometimes their yells reverberate through their parents' offices, factories, county courts or schools and non-parents are forced to acknowledge that life sometimes throws up greater imperatives than the next management meeting or sales conference. If, Leo, you one day read today's issue of this paper, you will find that we had barely begun to sort out how parents should raise children while earning money for their needs: the 'life-work balance' it was called. You may learn that as your mother went into hospital to give birth, another 'Blair babe', Tess Kingham, was forced to concede that she could no longer represent her constituents and answer the demands of her family within today's archaic parliamentary system. We have high hopes of you, Leo. Babies do not respect rank or stand on ceremony. They state their needs with deafening conviction. You will be stating yours in the heart of government at Number 10 Downing Street. Louder, Leo, louder! We will all benefit.",

It was so well done, you knew he had seen it for real.</p> <p>Sierra Leone is a country not just of amputated limbs; nine years of war have left the children with amputated minds.</p> <p>They called him Burn You - real name Sheku Jalloh - and he sat underneath the palm trees by the South Atlantic in what once must have been a very beautiful hotel, now run by two Catholic priests to give something back to the child soldiers. St Michael's rehab centre is half an hour south from Aberdeen, where the clatter from British Army Chinooks fills the sky and the car parks of the swankiest hotels are stuffed with white UN Land Cruisers, their chrome gleaming in the sun.</p> <p>Burn You was with two friends - a boy they called Corporal Highway, 11, (real name Saidu Kargbo) and a girl called Small Rebel, 12, (real name Tity Gbayo). The rebels had burnt a tattoo, RUF, which stands for Foday Sankoh's Revolutionary United Front, into her chest, but she was so ashamed she poured acid on the letters. The burns had corrugated the scar tissue, blurring the out line of the letters, but the pity of it was you could still make out RUF behind the scabs.</p> <p>All three had been taken to fight at the age of nine. Small Rebel and Corporal Highway were with the RUF; Burn You had been with the old SLA, the Sierra Leone Army. All sides had Small Boy Units, they said, but people tell you the RUF were the worst. The New SLA - trained and now supported by the British - are the government forces. They won the election and now have the coast. The RUF have the bush and the diamond fields. The war will continue until the RUF takes the coast, or the government takes the diamond fields.</p> <p>Corporal Highway demonstrated the trick of cutting off an adult's hands, if you belong to a Small Boy Unit. You force the man down on the ground and shove a gun barrel at the back of his neck. Lying prone, the subject is helpless. Then another boy takes the man's arm and rests it on a piece of wood, and then brings down the machete. Corporal Highway had done this many times.</p> <p>He used an AK47, which would have been only a little smaller than him. Burn You's weapon of choice was an SMG, a sub-machine gun. Small Rebel said she had a pistol, but she looked a little embarrassed, as though she might not have been allowed to use it all the time. Small Rebel's commander had been a woman, 'Colonel Gaddafi's wife', a woman called Mammy, around 27 years old. Small Rebel insisted to the others that this woman was Libyan, not local. This may sound incredible, but Libya and Liberia's president, Charles Taylor, back the RUF. It is quite likely one of Gaddafi's famous female bodyguards may have fought for the cause in the bush.</p> <p>Burn You showed how you cut down the rib cage and get at the liver, to eat it for 'main power'. Once you have chopped off a man's hands, you can do anything. Burn You ran through the options: you can cut off the ears and nose and lips, and give them to the victim to eat. You drink the blood from the back of the neck. If you slash the neck at the front, the blood spurts too fast and is wasted, he said.</p> <p>Children around the world tell tall stories, but I didn't think these three were making much up. The detail was too precise.</p> <p>Burn You's favourite torture was rubbing hot pepper into the eyes of a victim. Some of the peppers in West Africa are so ferocious they can burn your fingers when you touch them. Ordinary people were terribly afraid of the Small Boy Units, they said. They would enter villages to find everyone gone. Burn You said their name for dogs was Town Commandos, because when they appeared they were the only living things that had stayed on.</p> <p>They all suffered flashbacks, though none of them was quite as bad as one poor boy, who went round the centre screaming: 'I want to drink blood'. For Small Rebel, the worst memory was the time the rebels came to her home. They poured petrol over the mother, father, two brothers and sister and set fire to them, watching as they ran around, burning alive. And then they took her.</p> <p>That, and the times when the Small Boy Units caught a pregnant woman. 'They'd argue whether there was a boy child or a girl child in the belly,' she said. 'To solve the argument, they would cut open the belly with machetes. I saw this many times.' The British Army is here to secure the airport and evacuate any British nationals - that's the official line, which no one believes. The Paras and the Royal Marines out to sea and the SAS in the bush are here to try to put an end to the barbarity evidenced by these three children.</p> <p>Brigadier David Richards hasn't had the opportunity to talk to the child soldiers. But he has seen their work at the amputee camps. 'When I came out of there, my eyes were streaming,' he said. He is not a sentimentalist, but sharp as mustard, bespectacled, tough. He needs to be for the game of three-dimensional chess ahead of him.</p> <p>A Lebanese trader explained the problem of bringing peace to Sierra Leone: 'The rebels have the diamond fields. They sell the diamonds to Liberia. This makes good money for Charles Taylor. He sells the rebels the weapons. So long as the rebels have the diamonds, they have more money than the government. The war will continue until the government takes the diamond fields.'</p> <p>But won't the rebels collapse, now that Foday Sankoh has been arrested? 'Sankoh was just a card for Taylor,' he said.

CL's transport team, indeed, has a \u00a315.72 target price over the next 12 months. The broker also suggests the shares may be worth more than \u00a324 on a discounted cashflow basis, against \u00a311.82 now. </p> <p><strong> Floating music</strong><br> Stockwatch has been consistently cautious about Internet hype. But one imminent flotation we find hard to resist is meanfiddler.com, which starts trading on the Alternative Investment Market on Wednesday. </p> <p>The firm is the vehicle for music promoter Vince Power to broadcast Mean Fiddler events over the Internet and take advantage of changes in record distribution. </p> <p>Since starting Mean Fiddler in 1982, Power has built a strong entertainment group, responsible for the Reading festival, the Fleadhs and a growing number of bars and clubs. He has a formidable reputation as both music promoter and shrewd dealmaker. The group has a successful management team in place - and a well-established brand. </p> <p>Broker Hoodless Brennan is placing 40 million new shares at 7p each, raising \u00a32.8m and valuing the new company at \u00a315m. </p> <p>There is likely to be a scramble among Mean Fiddler fans, ensuring a decent premium when the shares make their debut.</p>",

As Deutsche Bundespost's link with Securicor shows, soon-to-be-privatised postal services are already on the prowl, as are big US parcel carriers such as UPS. Exel will be big, but is a mere mouthful to giants like these. Brokers Greig Middleton and Credit Lyonnais are just two to find Exel attractive right now. CL's transport team, indeed, has a \u00a315.72 target price over the next 12 months. The broker also suggests the shares may be worth more than \u00a324 on a discounted cashflow basis, against \u00a311.82 now. Floating music Stockwatch has been consistently cautious about Internet hype. But one imminent flotation we find hard to resist is meanfiddler.com, which starts trading on the Alternative Investment Market on Wednesday. The firm is the vehicle for music promoter Vince Power to broadcast Mean Fiddler events over the Internet and take advantage of changes in record distribution. Since starting Mean Fiddler in 1982, Power has built a strong entertainment group, responsible for the Reading festival, the Fleadhs and a growing number of bars and clubs. He has a formidable reputation as both music promoter and shrewd dealmaker. The group has a successful management team in place - and a well-established brand. Broker Hoodless Brennan is placing 40 million new shares at 7p each, raising \u00a32.8m and valuing the new company at \u00a315m. There is likely to be a scramble among Mean Fiddler fans, ensuring a decent premium when the shares make their debut.",

Freud's own interpretation of the tragedy was made after self-analysis in which he became aware of the hysteria of his brothers and sisters and described his father as perverted. 'His letters show that Freud started investigating the inter-generational causes of neuroses and then made an about turn when he came close to the truth in his own case,' Juff\u00e9 said. 'He could not accept that parents - including his own parents - could be responsible for the psychic problems undergone by children. In the end, he censured or attenuated the parents' role by elaborating the Oedipus complex so as not to take account of his own experience.' Juff\u00e9 concludes: 'The Oedipus complex has developed a life of its own and forms a screen in uncovering the reality of family suffering. 'Responsibility is collective and intergenerational. When we recognise this we can repair the faults of our parents and prevent the transmission of suffering and violence to our descendants.'",

      "bodyText": "Goodnight Rudi Giuliani, good morning Rick Lazio. New York woke up yesterday to a brave new world in which their irascible mayor, newly tender, had abandoned the field of electoral combat and his little known successor had, within hours, stepped up to the plate. Thus did the most highly charged Senate contest in recent American history spin into uncharted territory. And the big question was whether the 'hate factor' for Hillary Clinton, now the clear front-runner, was big enough to give Gingrich-Republican Lazio a fighting chance. Giuliani's ambitions for higher office have been derailed by prostate cancer, an affair and a nasty split with his wife. An unusually wistful Giuliani fought back tears late on Friday afternoon as he told astonished reporters there was more to life than politics - his health and the people he loves. 'I used to think the core of me was in politics. It isn't,' said Giuliani. 'I'm thinking of deeper, deeper things than politics. You know, life... number one... the medical treatment... and I'm going to think about how I can be a better person.' Within minutes of the final curtain on the gripping theatre at City Hall, all eyes were focused on the First Lady and the man almost certain to challenge her. First up was Hillary, by unfortunate contrast to Giuliani, appearing remote and coolly unemotional, living up to her contrived and carefully scripted image as she told a hastily-convened news conference that she had called the mayor after his remarks 'to wish him well, to tell him that I knew this was a difficult decision, and I certainly hope and pray - and I know all New Yorkers do - that he will have a full and speedy recovery.' She looked concerned, and so she should, Republicans were quick to assert. The usually bickering state and national top party brass had united around a candidate they now think has a better chance of defeating Clinton than Giuliani. Then up popped Lazio. An ambitious but relatively unknown Long Island Republican congressman with long-advertised designs on the Senate race and a $3.4 million war chest. Lazio proclaimed himself 'the strongest Republican candidate... and best able to unite our party and defeat Hillary Clinton in November.' The Republican establishment agrees, with New York state governor George Pataki, considered the strongest contender, having made it clear he intends to remain in Albany for some time. Lazio, who planned to challenge Giuliani for the nomination until Pataki persuaded him not to at the behest of GOP Presidential nominee George W Bush, got the nod days ago. By early Friday evening, TV cameras were already focused on the 'Lazio for Senate' posters and the 'Lazio 2000' T-shirts adorning a busy campaign headquarters, its phone banks already up and running. Galvanising the hate-Hillary vote is Lazio's best hope, say political pundits, but many now believe he may have a better chance than the controversial mayor. Lazio's telegenic youthfulness and amiable nature, along with his eight years experience representing his native New York in the House and moderate stance on abortion and gun control, could present a formidable challenge to the First Lady. 'Lazio is one thing Hillary is not - likeable,' says New York Daily News columnist Mike Barnicle. 'He's a suburban middle class \"local guy\", and all the better that he's an ethnic Italian Catholic and a younger, more amiable version of the mayor. If he positions himself as the guy taking on the elites, he really has a chance.' For the time being, Clinton can take comfort in the latest polls, showing Lazio trailing her 50 per cent rating by 19 points. 'It's hers to lose, but the numbers will tighten up within 72 hours,' said John Zogby of the independent pollster Zogby International. 'There is a large anti-Hillary vote out there; she appears to have a ceiling of acceptability in the mid-40s. 'Lazio is largely unknown, but there will be tremendous interest and he will be everywhere. It won't be long before he reaches a mid-40 rating - and we're back to a tight race.' Even the Rev Al Sharpton, the black leader and Giuliani nemesis, had words of warning for the Democratic candidate: 'She has a real challenge now. What she was going to get for free, she's now going to have to earn. 'Against Giuliani she could rely on a record turnout of black, minority and progressive voters, which is now less certain.' Clinton's best battle plan will be to define Lazio as a 'Gingrich Republican', a conservative extremist who supported House Speaker Newt Gingrich's now infamous 'Contract with America', which shut the government down and led to President Clinton's 1996 re-election. Meanwhile, Giuliani's heart-felt candour and hitherto unknown 'softer sensitive side' will position him well for a future run for high office. In the meantime, he says he's thinking about how to become a better person, and how he can become a better, more inclusive, New York City mayor. Giuliani, who once gave serious consideration to becoming a priest, may come full circle. 'God has given me a lot. And whatever obstacles that are placed in your way, I think the way to deal with it is to figure out how to make it make you a better person.' 'Are you closer to God?' a reporter asked. 'Am I closer to God? I hope he's closer to me.'",

Military officials are worried that the small intake will leave the army inadequately manned.</p> <p>This recruitment problem is an unwanted extra worry for Russia's generals. Plagued by difficulties since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the army remains in crisis. Russia's military placed hope in its president, Vladimir Putin, to reinvigorate the armed forces, but with limited resources it is likely his pre-election rhetoric may prove hollow. The hopes of those who expected him to institute radical changes to the way the Russian army is organised were crushed last week when he re-appointed former Defence Minister Igor Sergeyev, a member of the old guard, who is unlikely to preside over a shake-up.</p> <p>In the meantime, conditions for the conscripts look set to remain bleak; during their two years in the army most soldiers experience a system of bullying, poor rations and outdated equipment. They have to survive on 36 roubles a month (81p).</p> <p>But this year the prospect of active service in Chechnya has led even more draftees to resort to extreme measures to avoid entering the army. An early government commitment to keep conscripts away from frontline fighting was swiftly reneged upon last year. Of the 2,284 Russian soldiers dead and 6,645 wounded in the war so far, a significant proportion of these were conscripts - a strong disincentive to anyone contemplating their call-up papers.</p> <p>Traditionally, those teenagers who manage to evade service tend to be from Russia's privileged classes - studying at university, or with parents rich enough to pay up to $1,000 (\u00a3670) to pro cure a medical certificate testifying ill-health or bribe an army official to strike their name from the list. Some draftees, without such resources, embark on starvation diets so that they weigh below the acceptable level at the medical. Others affect psychiatric illnesses.</p> <p>Those unable to escape the draft face service in an army where conditions - according to the Soldiers' Mothers Com mittee, a pressure group dedicated to improving the lot of Russia's conscripts - 'are not worthy of human life'.</p> <p>The group says that about 1,000 draftees a year commit suicide to escape the misery. The worst fears of conscripts and their families are reflected in the experience of Alexei Kluchkov, now 19, a novice soldier who was brought in to fight in Dagestan last August at the start of Russia's battle against Chechen rebels.</p> <p>He said: 'We were given a few months' training, where the officers taught us tactics unchanged since World War II - and not at all suitable for the kind of combat we would be going into. Even the officers who were teaching us knew it was nonsense.'</p> <p>On his second day of active service, he and other ill-prepared conscripts from his unit came under fire. Kluchkov's left leg was blown off and he was pensioned off with a monthly payment of 240 roubles (\u00a35.45).</p> <p>Ilya Sobel, a trainee mechanic, did not try to escape the draft. 'He wanted to serve,' said his father, Pavel Sobel, a taxi driver. 'It's very worrying for us, especially with the situation in Chechnya, but it's only the rich New Russians who try to worm out of it.'</p> <p>The degradation of the armed forces has been starkly illustrated in the Chechen conflict. Despite the triumphalism which accompanied announcements that Russia now has the entire territory of the rebel state under its control, even a summary look at the facts of the war undermines any suggestion of victory. Some 92,000 Russian troops faced a band of Chechen rebels, thought to number no more than 10,000.</p> <p>The Russians had the upper hand in air power (the Chechen air force was comprehensively destroyed in the previous war), more artillery and many more tanks (at a ratio of something like 300:7) - and yet their progress through the region was tortuously slow and bloody.</p> <p>Military analysts argue that a shift to a professional army would improve Russia's performance. Aside from humanitarian concerns about the dire conditions endured by conscripts under the present system, they argue that with limited resources, the army wastes money every year on training for new recruits who are going to be available for just 24 months.</p> <p>Earlier this year Putin said he wanted 'to move in the direction' of a professional army, but other signals indicate the opposite. A decree issued by the President stipulated that Russian boys aged over 15 will receive mandatory military training classes during school hours to equip them for the day they join the army. Besides, such a radical reform currently looks unaffordable. Although the President pledged to boost defence spending by a third last year, the bulk of this money is expected to drain into the Chechen struggle - which is costing the government some \u00a360 million a month.</p> <p>Putin's own assessment of the army's condition has also been contradictory. In a recent report on national security he said the army's combat readiness was 'critically low', while declaring publicly: 'All talk about the collapse of the army and its low level of fitness for battle is just brazen lies.'</p> <p>But whatever the true extent of its weaknesses, the importance of the military's role in Putin's new Russia is clear. As the President carved up the country's internal boundaries into seven new districts to give himself greater power over the regions last week, five of his seven new representatives were picked from the senior ranks of the police, security forces and the army.</p>",

Some draftees, without such resources, embark on starvation diets so that they weigh below the acceptable level at the medical. Others affect psychiatric illnesses. Those unable to escape the draft face service in an army where conditions - according to the Soldiers' Mothers Com mittee, a pressure group dedicated to improving the lot of Russia's conscripts - 'are not worthy of human life'. The group says that about 1,000 draftees a year commit suicide to escape the misery. The worst fears of conscripts and their families are reflected in the experience of Alexei Kluchkov, now 19, a novice soldier who was brought in to fight in Dagestan last August at the start of Russia's battle against Chechen rebels. He said: 'We were given a few months' training, where the officers taught us tactics unchanged since World War II - and not at all suitable for the kind of combat we would be going into. Even the officers who were teaching us knew it was nonsense.' On his second day of active service, he and other ill-prepared conscripts from his unit came under fire. Kluchkov's left leg was blown off and he was pensioned off with a monthly payment of 240 roubles (\u00a35.45). Ilya Sobel, a trainee mechanic, did not try to escape the draft. 'He wanted to serve,' said his father, Pavel Sobel, a taxi driver. 'It's very worrying for us, especially with the situation in Chechnya, but it's only the rich New Russians who try to worm out of it.' The degradation of the armed forces has been starkly illustrated in the Chechen conflict. Despite the triumphalism which accompanied announcements that Russia now has the entire territory of the rebel state under its control, even a summary look at the facts of the war undermines any suggestion of victory. Some 92,000 Russian troops faced a band of Chechen rebels, thought to number no more than 10,000. The Russians had the upper hand in air power (the Chechen air force was comprehensively destroyed in the previous war), more artillery and many more tanks (at a ratio of something like 300:7) - and yet their progress through the region was tortuously slow and bloody. Military analysts argue that a shift to a professional army would improve Russia's performance. Aside from humanitarian concerns about the dire conditions endured by conscripts under the present system, they argue that with limited resources, the army wastes money every year on training for new recruits who are going to be available for just 24 months. Earlier this year Putin said he wanted 'to move in the direction' of a professional army, but other signals indicate the opposite. A decree issued by the President stipulated that Russian boys aged over 15 will receive mandatory military training classes during school hours to equip them for the day they join the army. Besides, such a radical reform currently looks unaffordable. Although the President pledged to boost defence spending by a third last year, the bulk of this money is expected to drain into the Chechen struggle - which is costing the government some \u00a360 million a month. Putin's own assessment of the army's condition has also been contradictory. In a recent report on national security he said the army's combat readiness was 'critically low', while declaring publicly: 'All talk about the collapse of the army and its low level of fitness for battle is just brazen lies.' But whatever the true extent of its weaknesses, the importance of the military's role in Putin's new Russia is clear. As the President carved up the country's internal boundaries into seven new districts to give himself greater power over the regions last week, five of his seven new representatives were picked from the senior ranks of the police, security forces and the army.",

Where aims (if not methods) are concerned, your own intuitions coincide with mine. I wholeheartedly share your aim of long-term stewardship of our planet, with its diverse and complex biosphere. </p> <p>But what about the instinctive wisdom in Saddam Hussein's black heart? What price the Wagnerian wind that rustled Hitler's twisted leaves? The Yorkshire Ripper heard religious voices in his head urging him to kill. How do we decide which intuitive inner voices to heed? </p> <p>This, it is important to say, is not a dilemma that science can solve. My own passionate concern for world stewardship is as emotional as yours. But where I allow feelings to influence my aims, when it comes to deciding the best method of achieving them I'd rather think than feel. And thinking, here, means scientific thinking. No more effective method exists. If it did, science would incorporate it. </p> <p>Next, Sir, I think you may have an exaggerated idea of the natural ness of 'traditional' or 'organic' agriculture. Agriculture has always been unnatural. Our species began to depart from our natural hunter-gatherer lifestyle as recently as 10,000 years ago - too short to measure on the evolutionary timescale. </p> <p>Wheat, be it ever so wholemeal and stoneground, is not a natural food for Homo sapiens. Nor is milk, except for children. Almost every morsel of our food is genetically modified - admittedly by artificial selection not artificial mutation, but the end result is the same. A wheat grain is a genetically modified grass seed, just as a pekinese is a genetically modified wolf. Playing God? We've been playing God for centuries! </p> <p>The large, anonymous crowds in which we now teem began with the agricultural revolution, and without agriculture we could survive in only a tiny fraction of our current numbers. Our high population is an agricultural (and technological and medical) artifact. It is far more unnatural than the population-limiting methods condemned as unnatural by the Pope. Like it or not, we are stuck with agriculture, and agriculture - all agriculture - is unnatural. We sold that pass 10,000 years ago. </p> <p>Does that mean there's nothing to choose between different kinds of agriculture when it comes to sustainable planetary welfare? Certainly not. Some are much more damaging than others, but it's no use appealing to 'nature', or to 'instinct' in order to decide which ones. You have to study the evidence, soberly and reasonably - scientifically. Slashing and burning (incidentally, no agricultural system is closer to being 'traditional') destroys our ancient forests. Overgrazing (again, widely practised by 'traditional' cultures) causes soil erosion and turns fertile pasture into desert. Moving to our own modern tribe, monoculture, fed by powdered fertilisers and poisons, is bad for the future; indiscriminate use of antibiotics to promote livestock growth is worse. </p> <p>Incidentally, one worrying aspect of the hysterical opposition to the possible risks from GM crops is that it diverts attention from definite dangers which are already well understood but largely ignored.

This is one reason the corporate thuggery that is destroying the rainforests is so criminal. </p> <p>On the other hand, we must beware of a very common misunderstanding of Darwinism. Tennyson was writing before Darwin but he got it right. Nature really is red in tooth and claw. Much as we might like to believe otherwise, natural selection, working within each species, does not favour long-term stewardship. It favours short-term gain.

Huxley, Darwin's bulldog, founded his ethics on a repudiation of Darwinism. Not a repudiation of Darwinism as science, of course, for you cannot repudiate truth. But the very fact that Darwinism is true makes it even more important for us to fight against the naturally selfish and exploitative tendencies of nature. We can do it. Probably no other species of animal or plant can. We can do it because our brains (admittedly given to us by natural selection for reasons of short-term Darwinian gain) are big enough to see into the future and plot long-term consequences. Natural selection is like a robot that can only climb uphill, even if this leaves it stuck on top of a measly hillock. There is no mechanism for going downhill, for crossing the valley to the lower slopes of the high mountain on the other side. There is no natural foresight, no mechanism for warning that present selfish gains are leading to species extinction - and indeed, 99 per cent of all species that have ever lived are extinct. </p> <p>The human brain, probably uniquely in the whole of evolutionary history, can see across the valley and can plot a course away from extinction and towards distant uplands. Long-term planning - and hence the very possibility of stewardship - is something utterly new on the planet, even alien. It exists only in human brains. The future is a new invention in evolution.

Nature is a short-term Darwinian profiteer. Darwin himself said it: 'What a book a devil's chaplain might write on the clumsy, wasteful, blundering, low, and horridly cruel works of nature.' </p> <p>Of course that's bleak, but there's no law saying the truth has to be cheerful; no point shooting the messenger - science - and no sense in preferring an alternative world view just because it feels more comfortable. In any case, science isn't all bleak. Nor, by the way, is science an arrogant know-all. Any scientist worthy of the name will warm to your quotation from Socrates: 'Wisdom is knowing that you don't know.' What else drives us to find out? </p> <p>What saddens me most, Sir, is how much you will be missing if you turn your back on science. I have tried to write about the poetic wonder of science myself, but may I take the liberty of presenting you with a book by another author? It is The Demon-Haunted World by the lamented Carl Sagan.

In any case, science isn't all bleak. Nor, by the way, is science an arrogant know-all. Any scientist worthy of the name will warm to your quotation from Socrates: 'Wisdom is knowing that you don't know.' What else drives us to find out? What saddens me most, Sir, is how much you will be missing if you turn your back on science. I have tried to write about the poetic wonder of science myself, but may I take the liberty of presenting you with a book by another author? It is The Demon-Haunted World by the lamented Carl Sagan. I'd call your attention especially to the subtitle: Science as a Candle in the Dark . \u0095 Richard Dawkins is the Charles Simonyi Professor of the Public Understanding of Science at Oxford University. His latest book is 'Unweaving the Rainbow' .",

      "body": "<p>It is a disconcerting thing, a shaking thing, to find I share a private passion with the Prince of Wales. But there it is. The passion is for a man, a writer, a tobacco farmer, a poet and essayist from Henry County, Kentucky, whom history may remember as the single most important and influential political thinker alive today. It is unlikely you have heard of Wendell Berry. Fame is fickle and prediction mostly daft; but it is likely that your descendants, assuming they are literate, interested people, will know his name.</p> <p>Berry is one of the influences on Charles's thinking on spiritual values and sustainable development, the subject of last week's Reith lecture. Charles's agonising, his large cars, personal extravagances and spiritual quest have been much mocked on these pages. Distinguished and wise scientists have been badly hurt by his generalised attacks on them. But in the longer term perhaps none of that matters so much. Charles has chosen to be part of a real world-sized political argument about power, science and control - nothing less than the direction of society - and in that argument, Berry's writing is becoming more and more influential.</p> <p>A word of warning: like many great political thinkers, Wendell Berry is an extremist, in much the same way as Thoreau was. His loathing for most of the sprawl, waste and junk of modern urban life is unrestrained; his stiff-necked local pride and his constant assertion of the importance of farming, the local and the specific, put him far beyond the reach of most professional politicians. He's against big corporations, free trade, computers and industrial farming. He is outside the ordinary conversation of politics but his secret power is that he's also a prose writer of genius. Searching for his books around the house I reflected that he's one of these writers whose books one keeps pressing on friends and never getting back - and a fine poet too, with a wildness and energy in his thought that makes him a dangerous guru for anyone.</p> <p>On some of these questions, including trade and admiration for science, I am on the other side of the fence. But the core of the oppositionist case put best by Berry goes wider than trade deals or pesticides. It is really about what it means to be human. The poet-farmer deals with this again and again, emphasising we are not to be defined by consumption but by our relationships with land, family and community, and above all by our capability for 'good work' - work done with care, affection, intelligence.</p> <p>Somewhere, in our scientific confidence and economic giantism, we have lost the plot, stopped being whole, broken contact with the world around us. It is not an original argument -- there are clear lines running from Rousseau, with his idealised Swiss peasants, to Prince Charles. There is, or is supposed to be, a connection between ever-greater scientific specialism, the narrowing of the liberal mind, and the reduction of people to mere consumers. No whole vision, no spiritual unity, no more generous human society. The Spanish philosopher Jos\u00e9 Ortega y Gasset (1883-1955), with his attacks on 'mass man', is perhaps the best example of this thinking; in each generation, he argued, 'the scientist through having to reduce the sphere of his labour, was progressively losing contact with other branches of science, with that integral interpreta tion of the universe which is the only thing deserving of the names of science, culture, European civilisation'. This is close to Prince Charles today: 'Of course our descendants will have scientific and technological expertise beyond our imagining but will they have the insight or the self-control to use this wisely...?'</p> <p>The prince is a very rich and unelected man whose views have blighted good people's careers, but here he asks a hugely important question - is humanity a species charging out of control, following one kind of thinking, lemming-like; or are we really sapiens, with the internal, democratic, philosophical levers to control the consequences of our own curiosity? Today, I'd say, our most striking common experience is acceleration - the speeding up of change in everyday life, the exponential growth of biological knowledge and computer power, the 24-hour financial spasms, the dizzying churn of technology. The same goes for the extinction of rival species - the biologist Edward O. Wilson speaks of the 'Hundred Heartbeat Club', his grimly witty name for the animal species which have 100 or fewer members, and are that number of heartbeats away from total extinction - eagles, Javan rhinos, Hawaiian crows, dolphin species, and so on. If the current rate of habitat destruction continues in forests and coral reefs alone, he says, half the species of animals and plants will be gone by the next century: 'Our descendants would inherit a biologically impoverished and homogenised world.'</p> <p>So, for Charles to raise the question of speed and control, the duty of one generation to the next, the problem of reconciling the acceleration of today with the longer rhythms of planetary life, is something he can hardly be mocked for.</p> <p>What, though, of the answer? A return to 'nature' is not it. As Charles suggests, the complexity of life on Earth ought to (and does) inspire humble awe in scientific atheists as well as spiritual believers. But mankind, inside nature, has altered it irrevocably, not least by reproducing with such exponential success. Even if we wanted to clamber back in again to the pre-industrial natural world, with its harsh choices and smaller populations, it is not possible. Nature was never stable, particularly since we were always part of it. Now, with our sprawling populations and needs, there is no return journey available - not short of the greatest catastrophe to occur to our species so far.</p> <p>None of this rules out a more intelligent, knowing approach to land-use, of course: but a return to organic and sustainable farming is a slow thing, which will probably be led by the richest parts of the world and driven by consumer power. The bigger issue is consumer power itself. Charles often puts this in the context of spirituality, but he understands, surely, that to advocate self-restraint, as he does, is to fundamentally challenge consumer capitalism. It is based on appetite, consumption and waste; they are not by-products but driving forces.</p> <p>Wendell Berry's ideal is a deliberately frugal farmer on the banks of the Kentucky river, who does not squander and has put decades of human sweat into his land. He is a model of self-control or, as he would put it, 'good work'. He is the opposite of mass man. Charles's position is unique, so far outside ordinary experience he can offer little practical advice.</p> <p>He is a highly privileged Westerner, crammed with literary knowledge, owning good land and with the leisure and mental gifts to think. Most of the world's population are not living in plenty, have no ambition to return to peasant lives and would greet the news that their materialism was the problem with no little bemusement.</p> <p>Indeed, as the Prince tip-toes towards a full-throated critique of consumer economics, he moves closer to some curious companions, such as the anti-free trade movement and anarcho-green organisations such as People's Global Action. This group, barely mentioned in mainstream journalism, originated in a protest in southern Mexico in 1994 against the North American Free Trade Association, and has held key meetings or 'encounters' in Bangalore, Geneva, Belem in the Amazon and the US. Its keenest supporters include French and Indian farmers, Indonesian trade unionists, even Ukrainian environmentalists. Its geographical reach is as impressive as that of many multi-national corporations.</p> <p>This is possible thanks to the Internet, which is to this generation of anti-capitalists what the illegal printing press was to the Leninists a century ago. There are literally hundreds of links between different anti-capitalism sites and a great slew of advice, information and argument spinning round the world. It all has a tremendous idealistic and romantic appeal. One of the protest groups, Mayday 2000, describes itself as 'a maverick wild child' while the PGA itself speaks of its origins in 'the humid mists of the Chiapas' whence the rebels emerged 'using a jungle-battered laptop computer... people everywhere soon heard of the uprising'. Soon this lot will have their Che as well. Meanwhile, they use homely revolutionary saws, such as 'If you think you are too small to make a difference, try sleeping with a mosquito'.</p> <p>This is hardly, yet, a movement. It is more of a hubbub of concern and anger, a mood, a ragged world-wide heckle against science-driven, free-trading consumerism, which runs from Prince Charles at one extreme and anarchists at the other, with millions of trade unionists, religious groups and non-governmental organisations such as Greenpeace, Jubilee 2000, Christian Aid and the World Development Movement in the middle.</p> <p>It is the inevitable reaction to the vast power of global business, riding on the back of our scientific flowering - ultimately a protest at the effects of the Enlightenment. It won't 'win'; there will be no final settlement. But it will shape choices and change the politics of the next few decades. The important thing for Prince Charles to remember is that it is not a 'safe' thing, all this, limited to spiritual musing and hesitation about science. There is now no gap between humanity on the one hand and science on the other. The real argument is between angry people and is about power, markets and democracy. It is not about 'natural values' - Charles's 'grain of nature' is a cruel, predatory cycle - but about how to regain self-restraint and an understanding of time that goes beyond fashions or five-year electoral cycles. And that's a political matter.</p> <p>In one essay, Wendell Berry says the problem is that America (but the same goes for us) has become 'a nation of fantasists. We believe, apparently, in the infinite availability of finite re-sources... We believe democratic freedom can be preserved by people ignorant of the history of democracy and indifferent to the responsibilities of freedom'. Berry is a great figure because he is also a passionate democrat.</p> <p>This is my last column: I am off to the BBC to report politics from there, though I hope to keep writing on other things. But it seems a good theme to end on. Prince Charles's intervention speaks to two great truths that are vital for people like me to remember in the 'who's up, who's down' world of Westminster. First, politics doesn't stop at tax rates or the result of the next election - it touches our all our futures. But second, whatever the problem, democracy will be part of the answer.</p> <p><b>Poet who sees sermons in stones</b></p> <p>Wendell Berry is a farmer-poet of the Patrick Kavanagh ilk who sees sermons in stones. He is a prolific writer of mystic poetry and ecological essays, a mainstream American poet.</p> <p>Berry is a professor at Kentucky University and a teacher at Schumacher College, an ecological studies centre in Devon. An agricultural seer, he espouses a return to a more low-tech, considered existence, and farms tobacco, sheep and vegetables in Kentucky. One of his greatest concerns is the 'industrial eater' - typical city consumers who eat mass-produced food without knowing or caring about its origins.</p> <p>Another of Berry's hobbyhorses, shared with Prince Charles, is saving rural communities. Not that everyone should turn to the Good Life:</p> <p>'Anyone who understands farming would be aghast at the idea of a lot of city people rushing into the country to farm. It would be like a mass movement to play the violin.'</p>",

Now, with our sprawling populations and needs, there is no return journey available - not short of the greatest catastrophe to occur to our species so far. None of this rules out a more intelligent, knowing approach to land-use, of course: but a return to organic and sustainable farming is a slow thing, which will probably be led by the richest parts of the world and driven by consumer power. The bigger issue is consumer power itself. Charles often puts this in the context of spirituality, but he understands, surely, that to advocate self-restraint, as he does, is to fundamentally challenge consumer capitalism. It is based on appetite, consumption and waste; they are not by-products but driving forces. Wendell Berry's ideal is a deliberately frugal farmer on the banks of the Kentucky river, who does not squander and has put decades of human sweat into his land. He is a model of self-control or, as he would put it, 'good work'. He is the opposite of mass man. Charles's position is unique, so far outside ordinary experience he can offer little practical advice. He is a highly privileged Westerner, crammed with literary knowledge, owning good land and with the leisure and mental gifts to think. Most of the world's population are not living in plenty, have no ambition to return to peasant lives and would greet the news that their materialism was the problem with no little bemusement. Indeed, as the Prince tip-toes towards a full-throated critique of consumer economics, he moves closer to some curious companions, such as the anti-free trade movement and anarcho-green organisations such as People's Global Action. This group, barely mentioned in mainstream journalism, originated in a protest in southern Mexico in 1994 against the North American Free Trade Association, and has held key meetings or 'encounters' in Bangalore, Geneva, Belem in the Amazon and the US. Its keenest supporters include French and Indian farmers, Indonesian trade unionists, even Ukrainian environmentalists. Its geographical reach is as impressive as that of many multi-national corporations. This is possible thanks to the Internet, which is to this generation of anti-capitalists what the illegal printing press was to the Leninists a century ago. There are literally hundreds of links between different anti-capitalism sites and a great slew of advice, information and argument spinning round the world. It all has a tremendous idealistic and romantic appeal. One of the protest groups, Mayday 2000, describes itself as 'a maverick wild child' while the PGA itself speaks of its origins in 'the humid mists of the Chiapas' whence the rebels emerged 'using a jungle-battered laptop computer... people everywhere soon heard of the uprising'. Soon this lot will have their Che as well. Meanwhile, they use homely revolutionary saws, such as 'If you think you are too small to make a difference, try sleeping with a mosquito'. This is hardly, yet, a movement. It is more of a hubbub of concern and anger, a mood, a ragged world-wide heckle against science-driven, free-trading consumerism, which runs from Prince Charles at one extreme and anarchists at the other, with millions of trade unionists, religious groups and non-governmental organisations such as Greenpeace, Jubilee 2000, Christian Aid and the World Development Movement in the middle. It is the inevitable reaction to the vast power of global business, riding on the back of our scientific flowering - ultimately a protest at the effects of the Enlightenment. It won't 'win'; there will be no final settlement. But it will shape choices and change the politics of the next few decades. The important thing for Prince Charles to remember is that it is not a 'safe' thing, all this, limited to spiritual musing and hesitation about science. There is now no gap between humanity on the one hand and science on the other. The real argument is between angry people and is about power, markets and democracy. It is not about 'natural values' - Charles's 'grain of nature' is a cruel, predatory cycle - but about how to regain self-restraint and an understanding of time that goes beyond fashions or five-year electoral cycles. And that's a political matter. In one essay, Wendell Berry says the problem is that America (but the same goes for us) has become 'a nation of fantasists. We believe, apparently, in the infinite availability of finite re-sources... We believe democratic freedom can be preserved by people ignorant of the history of democracy and indifferent to the responsibilities of freedom'. Berry is a great figure because he is also a passionate democrat. This is my last column: I am off to the BBC to report politics from there, though I hope to keep writing on other things. But it seems a good theme to end on. Prince Charles's intervention speaks to two great truths that are vital for people like me to remember in the 'who's up, who's down' world of Westminster. First, politics doesn't stop at tax rates or the result of the next election - it touches our all our futures. But second, whatever the problem, democracy will be part of the answer. Poet who sees sermons in stones Wendell Berry is a farmer-poet of the Patrick Kavanagh ilk who sees sermons in stones. He is a prolific writer of mystic poetry and ecological essays, a mainstream American poet. Berry is a professor at Kentucky University and a teacher at Schumacher College, an ecological studies centre in Devon. An agricultural seer, he espouses a return to a more low-tech, considered existence, and farms tobacco, sheep and vegetables in Kentucky. One of his greatest concerns is the 'industrial eater' - typical city consumers who eat mass-produced food without knowing or caring about its origins. Another of Berry's hobbyhorses, shared with Prince Charles, is saving rural communities. Not that everyone should turn to the Good Life: 'Anyone who understands farming would be aghast at the idea of a lot of city people rushing into the country to farm. It would be like a mass movement to play the violin.'",

She is six months' pregnant and expects to make the most of her country's generous parental rights.

Men are also entitled to take some of their partner's entitlement, meaning the total leave can be shared.</p> <p>Martin said: 'Some of the blokes say \"Don't you have to rush home for the children?\" They assume it's the woman who will rush home.

'They were allowed into the workplace so long as they worked like men. But the normal working model here is based on just half the population. The whole issue of long hours, the attitude to job-sharing and part-time working for men and women needs to be addressed.'</p> <p>Julia Mellor, head of the Equal Opportunities Commission, said: 'Employers as well as employees have much to gain from better parental leave and maternity arrangements. Many are concerned about the number of people leaving good jobs because they are not prepared to sacrifice family life for their career.'</p> <p>Firms in Scandinavia try harder to attract mothers - and then keep them. Le Calv\u00e9 said: 'Women are now asking for some help or other benefits than salaries so instead of getting a company car or a raise in salary they say, \"I want 20 hours a week cleaning paid for by the company\".'</p> <p>Labour MP Ruth Kelly, a member of the 101-strong Labour parliamentary women's group, who wants parents to be paid \u00a3150 a week to take three months' leave, said: 'We need a complete rethink of our maternity and parental leave and this is what is going on at the moment at the DTI. We have the Department of Health saying on the one hand that it is wise to breast-feed your baby for the first six months and on the other hand we have maternity leave which means that after the first six weeks the statutory pay is only \u00a359.55 per week.'</p> <p>Roger Lyons, general secretary of the Manufacturing, Science and Finance Union, said yesterday at the the National Women's Conference: 'There is a disgraceful pay gap between men and women, and most women suffer in silence from discrimination at work.'</p> <p>He said that the right for all workers to be represented by a union, which comes into effect on 6 June, will benefit women especially.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Leading businesswomen launched a scathing attack on the Government's record on maternity rights last night, claiming that Britain is 'the worst place in Europe to be a working mother'. The condemnation came as female executives from overseas, on an advanced management course at the London Business School this month, heard with astonishment of the poor leave arrangements and employer attitudes that high-flying British women face. Julia Martin, a fund manager, drew gasps from her foreign counterparts when she said she could take just 14 weeks' maternity leave after the birth of her second baby. 'It took me three months just to get used to being a mum,' said Randi Birkeland, mother to four children and a vice president of Norway's Hydro Supply Network. In Norway, as in Denmark and Sweden, women are entitled to a year's paid leave and for a year after they return to work they are entitled to work shorter hours while they continue breast-feeding. Margareta Le Calv\u00e9, general manager of Swedish communications giant Telenordia, has recently been promoted. She is six months' pregnant and expects to make the most of her country's generous parental rights. These include an incentive to fathers to take 10 days' paid leave after the birth and then a further four weeks during the child's first year. Men are also entitled to take some of their partner's entitlement, meaning the total leave can be shared. Martin said: 'Some of the blokes say \"Don't you have to rush home for the children?\" They assume it's the woman who will rush home. They think women won't want to travel away from home.' Mary-Ann Stephenson, director of the Fawcett Society, which campaigns for equality between women and men, said: 'This is not limited to small companies. The majority of male directors of FTSE-100 companies are married with children. The majority of the few women directors are single without children. Yet when we look abroad it is obvious that a company can still be efficient and make lots of money if it looks after its female employees.' The average woman in Britain has just eight weeks' maternity leave on full pay compared to the European average of 32 weeks. Stephenson said women in this country have come to accept a poor deal as normal. 'They were allowed into the workplace so long as they worked like men. But the normal working model here is based on just half the population. The whole issue of long hours, the attitude to job-sharing and part-time working for men and women needs to be addressed.' Julia Mellor, head of the Equal Opportunities Commission, said: 'Employers as well as employees have much to gain from better parental leave and maternity arrangements. Many are concerned about the number of people leaving good jobs because they are not prepared to sacrifice family life for their career.' Firms in Scandinavia try harder to attract mothers - and then keep them. Le Calv\u00e9 said: 'Women are now asking for some help or other benefits than salaries so instead of getting a company car or a raise in salary they say, \"I want 20 hours a week cleaning paid for by the company\".' Labour MP Ruth Kelly, a member of the 101-strong Labour parliamentary women's group, who wants parents to be paid \u00a3150 a week to take three months' leave, said: 'We need a complete rethink of our maternity and parental leave and this is what is going on at the moment at the DTI. We have the Department of Health saying on the one hand that it is wise to breast-feed your baby for the first six months and on the other hand we have maternity leave which means that after the first six weeks the statutory pay is only \u00a359.55 per week.' Roger Lyons, general secretary of the Manufacturing, Science and Finance Union, said yesterday at the the National Women's Conference: 'There is a disgraceful pay gap between men and women, and most women suffer in silence from discrimination at work.' He said that the right for all workers to be represented by a union, which comes into effect on 6 June, will benefit women especially.",

      "body": "<p>A former IRA killer has emerged as a key player in David Trimble's bitter struggle to persuade his fellow Ulster Unionists to back the latest phase in the peace process.</p> <p>Sean O'Callaghan, the former IRA commander, helped Trimble rally his wary troops last week, launching a battle against the rising tide of scepticism over the IRA's offer to put their arms beyond use.</p> <p>O'Callaghan is understood to have told a number of sceptics inside the Ulster Unionist Party, including the deputy leader John Taylor, that the IRA was serious about its proposal and that the war was well and truly over.</p> <p>Speaking from a secret location in Britain yesterday, O'Callaghan - who still fears for his life - said: 'My advice to the Ulster Unionists is that the war is over, historical armed republicanism is no more.</p> <p>'The new war will be fought on the political and cultural battlefield and I believe unionists and democrats should take up that fight. The question is do unionists want to take up that new fight or are they prepared to fight on with the old war? They have to realise that the IRA's armed struggle is over.'</p> <p>Several of Trimble's closest allies were nervous and deeply uncertain about the IRA plan to put arms beyond use and allow international observers to monitor arms dumps. Their caution led to the postponement of yesterday's proposed Ulster Unionist Council meeting.</p> <p>According to informed sources O'Callaghan spoke with Taylor following the MP's meeting with Tony Blair at Downing Street last Wednesday. Taylor was said to have been 'disappointed' in the Prime Minister's attitude but O'Callaghan retorted: 'And do you think Blair is happy with you?'</p> <p>In recent days O'Callaghan has been lobbying UUP members who are uncertain which way to vote next Saturday when the 860-strong party council decides if it will return to government, sharing power with Sinn Fein.</p> <p>As a volunteer in the East Tyrone brigade, O'Callaghan shot dead a Catholic RUC offi cer and was involved in a mortar attack on an army base which killed a woman soldier. He subsequently recanted and offered his services to the Irish police. Among the plots he helped the security forces foil was an attempt to kill Princess Diana and Prince Charles at a charity rock concert in London.</p> <p>The former IRA killer first met Trimble after leaving prison in December 1996. Following the second IRA ceasefire in July 1997, he sent Trimble a fax outlining why he should enter political talks with Sinn Fein - at a time when many other unionists were threatening to boycott negotiations if republicans were included.</p> <p>While in prison O'Callaghan corresponded with an eclectic array of individuals - including establishment figures such as Lord Cranborne, then leader of the Tories in the House of Lords. He subsequently persuaded Cranborne to back the Good Friday accord and canvass support for it among the unionist community.</p> <p>This week O'Callghan is poised to write press articles and give television interviews in the run up to Saturday's critical decision.</p> <p>Trimble strategists have also deployed the arguments of other republicans - who would regard O'Callaghan as a traitor to the cause. An article by Tommy McKearney, a former IRA hunger striker is being distributed to delegates this weekend. In it, McKearney argues that the IRA offer effectively marks the end of the Provisionals' war and that putting weapons beyond use is 'decommissioning by other means.'</p> <p>But the strategy of using republican voices to win over loyalists may fall on deaf ears. Even some Unionist MPs are unaware of who the republican sceptics are and what they are saying. One such is Willie Thompson, MP for West Tyrone, a consistent opponent of the Good Friday Agreement and critic of Trimble's leadership. He fears that if republicans do not get their way, they will revert to force.</p> <p>When it was put to him that those with intimate knowledge of the republican movement - former prisoners like McKearney and other dissident republican intellectuals - were convinced the IRA offer signalled the end of the war, the MP said: 'I'm sorry, who are they? I've never heard of them.'</p> <p>One of Trimble's closest allies summed up the prob lems that beset the UUP leader as he attempts to persuade his party that the IRA is serious about peace: 'If an MP doesn't know or care to read what the most articulate republican sceptics are saying about the IRA offer, then look how difficult it's going to be to get through to the farmer from Fermanagh or the businessman in Ballymena.'</p> <p>By the end of this week we will know if the influence of a man who once vowed to physically destroy the union, Sean O'Callaghan, will be strong enough to help persuade a sufficient number of Ulster Unionists that the war machine of which he was once a part of is about to be decommissioned.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A former IRA killer has emerged as a key player in David Trimble's bitter struggle to persuade his fellow Ulster Unionists to back the latest phase in the peace process. Sean O'Callaghan, the former IRA commander, helped Trimble rally his wary troops last week, launching a battle against the rising tide of scepticism over the IRA's offer to put their arms beyond use. O'Callaghan is understood to have told a number of sceptics inside the Ulster Unionist Party, including the deputy leader John Taylor, that the IRA was serious about its proposal and that the war was well and truly over. Speaking from a secret location in Britain yesterday, O'Callaghan - who still fears for his life - said: 'My advice to the Ulster Unionists is that the war is over, historical armed republicanism is no more. 'The new war will be fought on the political and cultural battlefield and I believe unionists and democrats should take up that fight. The question is do unionists want to take up that new fight or are they prepared to fight on with the old war? They have to realise that the IRA's armed struggle is over.' Several of Trimble's closest allies were nervous and deeply uncertain about the IRA plan to put arms beyond use and allow international observers to monitor arms dumps. Their caution led to the postponement of yesterday's proposed Ulster Unionist Council meeting. According to informed sources O'Callaghan spoke with Taylor following the MP's meeting with Tony Blair at Downing Street last Wednesday. Taylor was said to have been 'disappointed' in the Prime Minister's attitude but O'Callaghan retorted: 'And do you think Blair is happy with you?' In recent days O'Callaghan has been lobbying UUP members who are uncertain which way to vote next Saturday when the 860-strong party council decides if it will return to government, sharing power with Sinn Fein. As a volunteer in the East Tyrone brigade, O'Callaghan shot dead a Catholic RUC offi cer and was involved in a mortar attack on an army base which killed a woman soldier. He subsequently recanted and offered his services to the Irish police. Among the plots he helped the security forces foil was an attempt to kill Princess Diana and Prince Charles at a charity rock concert in London. The former IRA killer first met Trimble after leaving prison in December 1996. Following the second IRA ceasefire in July 1997, he sent Trimble a fax outlining why he should enter political talks with Sinn Fein - at a time when many other unionists were threatening to boycott negotiations if republicans were included. While in prison O'Callaghan corresponded with an eclectic array of individuals - including establishment figures such as Lord Cranborne, then leader of the Tories in the House of Lords. He subsequently persuaded Cranborne to back the Good Friday accord and canvass support for it among the unionist community. This week O'Callghan is poised to write press articles and give television interviews in the run up to Saturday's critical decision. Trimble strategists have also deployed the arguments of other republicans - who would regard O'Callaghan as a traitor to the cause. An article by Tommy McKearney, a former IRA hunger striker is being distributed to delegates this weekend. In it, McKearney argues that the IRA offer effectively marks the end of the Provisionals' war and that putting weapons beyond use is 'decommissioning by other means.' But the strategy of using republican voices to win over loyalists may fall on deaf ears. Even some Unionist MPs are unaware of who the republican sceptics are and what they are saying. One such is Willie Thompson, MP for West Tyrone, a consistent opponent of the Good Friday Agreement and critic of Trimble's leadership. He fears that if republicans do not get their way, they will revert to force. When it was put to him that those with intimate knowledge of the republican movement - former prisoners like McKearney and other dissident republican intellectuals - were convinced the IRA offer signalled the end of the war, the MP said: 'I'm sorry, who are they? I've never heard of them.' One of Trimble's closest allies summed up the prob lems that beset the UUP leader as he attempts to persuade his party that the IRA is serious about peace: 'If an MP doesn't know or care to read what the most articulate republican sceptics are saying about the IRA offer, then look how difficult it's going to be to get through to the farmer from Fermanagh or the businessman in Ballymena.' By the end of this week we will know if the influence of a man who once vowed to physically destroy the union, Sean O'Callaghan, will be strong enough to help persuade a sufficient number of Ulster Unionists that the war machine of which he was once a part of is about to be decommissioned.",

The fairer sex spends millions of pounds a year on keeping legs smooth, bikini lines neat and underarms fuzz-free to conform with male expectations of beauty. Now men are responding to women's demands that they too must make sacrifices.</p> <p>'Sales of home-waxing kits rose by 41 per cent this month and our customer panel and focus groups report that the increase, which is higher than anything we've seen in previous years, is because men are asking women to buy kits for them,' said a spokeswoman for Tesco.</p> <p>Boots, which has two shops in Bristol and Edinburgh specifically for men's products and grooming treatments, introduced back and chest waxes two months ago.</p> <p>'It used to be something only gay men did,' said Boots Men project manager Phil Thomson. 'Now there are two main reasons why men want to have a smooth back or chest. The first is that women don't like really hirsute men. The second is for sport.</p> <p>'Chest waxes are promoted as the boxer's wax, back waxes as the swimmer's wax and leg waxes as the cyclist's wax.'</p> <p>John, a 42-year-old builder from Hertfordshire, would die rather than admit he let his girlfriend rip the hairs off his back for the first time this year. 'I reckon quite a few of them do it, just like they dye their hair but won't admit it. I just had a hairy back and of course I can't even see it, but my girlfriend didn't like it. In the end I let her wax it. It wasn't really that painful. It felt like pinpricks.'</p> <p>But Dave Parkin, a 29-year-old business writer from Wales, is one of the new breed of men who waxes without shame, if not without pain. 'I decided to get it done before I went on holiday,' he explained. 'All the women I know say how much they hate hair on shoulders and backs. I decided I would feel more confident on the beach if I got rid of it. 'It was the most painful thing I have ever experienced. I had to grit my teeth each time she put the wax on and laid that cloth strip on it.'</p> <p>Tesco said sales of home-waxing kits and depilatory creams to women are fairly constant through the year, because they always feel the need to be hair-free. 'We noticed that suddenly the wax strips were shooting off the shelves and our routine market research tells us that women are buying them for men,' said the spokeswoman.</p> <p>Wax kits are more popular for men than the creams that women favour because male hair is much tougher and the creams are not strong enough to do the job, she added.</p> <p>Tesco believes the exposure given to David Beckham's new back tattoo and to smooth-chested icons such as flamenco dancer Joaqu\u00edn Cort\u00e9s are also having an impact on men's self-image.</p> <p>A seasonal factor is also at play, said Boots. 'Back waxing is a new summer service for men,' said Thomson. 'It isn't something they would really bother about while they can cover it up.'</p>",

      "bodyText": "Men are tearing their hair out to attract the opposite sex, according to high street retailers and beauty salons. Women have said it for years: back hair is seldom appealing, but men expect their partners to put up with it. The fairer sex spends millions of pounds a year on keeping legs smooth, bikini lines neat and underarms fuzz-free to conform with male expectations of beauty. Now men are responding to women's demands that they too must make sacrifices. 'Sales of home-waxing kits rose by 41 per cent this month and our customer panel and focus groups report that the increase, which is higher than anything we've seen in previous years, is because men are asking women to buy kits for them,' said a spokeswoman for Tesco. Boots, which has two shops in Bristol and Edinburgh specifically for men's products and grooming treatments, introduced back and chest waxes two months ago. 'It used to be something only gay men did,' said Boots Men project manager Phil Thomson. 'Now there are two main reasons why men want to have a smooth back or chest. The first is that women don't like really hirsute men. The second is for sport. 'Chest waxes are promoted as the boxer's wax, back waxes as the swimmer's wax and leg waxes as the cyclist's wax.' John, a 42-year-old builder from Hertfordshire, would die rather than admit he let his girlfriend rip the hairs off his back for the first time this year. 'I reckon quite a few of them do it, just like they dye their hair but won't admit it. I just had a hairy back and of course I can't even see it, but my girlfriend didn't like it. In the end I let her wax it. It wasn't really that painful. It felt like pinpricks.' But Dave Parkin, a 29-year-old business writer from Wales, is one of the new breed of men who waxes without shame, if not without pain. 'I decided to get it done before I went on holiday,' he explained. 'All the women I know say how much they hate hair on shoulders and backs. I decided I would feel more confident on the beach if I got rid of it. 'It was the most painful thing I have ever experienced. I had to grit my teeth each time she put the wax on and laid that cloth strip on it.' Tesco said sales of home-waxing kits and depilatory creams to women are fairly constant through the year, because they always feel the need to be hair-free. 'We noticed that suddenly the wax strips were shooting off the shelves and our routine market research tells us that women are buying them for men,' said the spokeswoman. Wax kits are more popular for men than the creams that women favour because male hair is much tougher and the creams are not strong enough to do the job, she added. Tesco believes the exposure given to David Beckham's new back tattoo and to smooth-chested icons such as flamenco dancer Joaqu\u00edn Cort\u00e9s are also having an impact on men's self-image. A seasonal factor is also at play, said Boots. 'Back waxing is a new summer service for men,' said Thomson. 'It isn't something they would really bother about while they can cover it up.'",

The Alliance claims it has 400,000 members, but believes it could call on thousands more if it took to the streets, as it did with the Countryside Rally three years ago. In the run-up to the next election, the Alliance leadership has decided to rebrand the organisation as the voice of rural Britain in an attempt to counter claims that it is merely a front for the bloodsports lobby. Countryside Alliance spokesman Nigel Henson said members would await the response of the Government to the inquiry by Lord Burns into hunting with dogs - due out at the end of this month. But he added: 'The Government will find fierce resistance if it goes ahead.' Over the next year the Alliance plans to campaign on rural crime and spearhead the fight against cutbacks on post offices, banks and bus services. Later this month the Alliance will endorse 'Crime Protection Kits' produced by the police for people living in isolated farms. These kits will contain information on securing vulnerable properties and identifying possible perpetrators to the police. The Staffordshire force will be the first to issue kits, but the Alliance plans to roll out the scheme across the country. The organisation has also printed tens of thousands of postcards to be placed in the windows of rural post offices with instructions on how to campaign against closures. Simon Pope, spokesman for the Campaign for the Protection of Hunted Animals, an umbrella group for the RSPCA, International Fund for Animal Welfare and League Against Cruel Sports, said: 'The Alliance is interested in one thing.

We had a few close shaves but none that could be blamed on the trusty, rusty Land Cruiser, which was reliable to the end and which, despite its faults and its driver, was great fun.</p> <p>Comparing my African experiences with driving the new Toyota Land Cruiser Amazon (admittedly in deepest, darkest Surrey) is a bit like trying to find similarities between a sit-up-and- beg bone-shaker and a Harley-Davidson. The 4.7 litre, V8 petrol engine is not quite silent but certainly a purr compared to a roar. It is clearly very powerful and acceleration to 80 mph on the motorway felt stable and smooth. Its top speed is given as 109 mph and apparently this is due to the independent front suspension and the steering control. I'm a bit of a novice when it comes to four-speed electronically controlled automatic gearboxes and, personally, I prefer the challenge of a manual, but driving on the flat was an effortless pleasure.</p> <p>I was seated higher than most other drivers and felt that nobody was going to argue with me, whatever I did. Nobody flashed at me for hogging the middle lane, and when I came up behind cars in the fast lane they got out of my way. The Amazon is also undeniably comfortable. It seats seven in business-class style, making long journeys a delight for passengers and driver alike. Economically, however, 17 miles per gallon is a high price to pay for the back-seat headrests and all that legroom. Also, despite its impressive power steering, the Amazon's size makes parking much more of an effort - especially in central London.</p> <p>At the risk of upsetting ramblers, I took the Amazon off-road and was amazed at the ease with which this permanent four-wheel drive dealt with steep hills, thick mud and uneven or nonexistent road surfaces. I imagine that driving a Hovercraft must feel like this. It was so easy, though, that I felt a bit cheated and missed the thrill and sense of achievement that comes with scaling great heights (usually termite mounds) by driving skill alone. Another niggle: it strikes me that a cream carpet and matching leather upholstery is a strange choice of interior decor for an off-road vehicle.</p> <p>Overall the Amazon left me feeling confused; I can't work out who it is aimed at. It's too smart, too perfect and, I imagine, too easy for the 'gripped' fraternity of serious off-roaders. Personally, I would be frightened of splattering it with mud and ruining the luxurious finishes. Having a six-disc CD changer, storage space for sunglasses and drink holders between the two front seats seems similarly at odds with a vehicle that claims to be 'designed to cope with the most arduous conditions'.</p> <p>So, although a climate-control function might have been tempting, I don't think I would have swapped the Amazon for its Africa-based counterpart which, in my opinion, was far more fun to drive. I imagine that the Amazon is largely bought by families who need it for school runs and overloaded trips from the supermarket. Forgive the cynicism, but their off-road parking is probably about as 'gripped' as it'll get.</p>",

Economically, however, 17 miles per gallon is a high price to pay for the back-seat headrests and all that legroom. Also, despite its impressive power steering, the Amazon's size makes parking much more of an effort - especially in central London. At the risk of upsetting ramblers, I took the Amazon off-road and was amazed at the ease with which this permanent four-wheel drive dealt with steep hills, thick mud and uneven or nonexistent road surfaces. I imagine that driving a Hovercraft must feel like this. It was so easy, though, that I felt a bit cheated and missed the thrill and sense of achievement that comes with scaling great heights (usually termite mounds) by driving skill alone. Another niggle: it strikes me that a cream carpet and matching leather upholstery is a strange choice of interior decor for an off-road vehicle. Overall the Amazon left me feeling confused; I can't work out who it is aimed at. It's too smart, too perfect and, I imagine, too easy for the 'gripped' fraternity of serious off-roaders. Personally, I would be frightened of splattering it with mud and ruining the luxurious finishes. Having a six-disc CD changer, storage space for sunglasses and drink holders between the two front seats seems similarly at odds with a vehicle that claims to be 'designed to cope with the most arduous conditions'. So, although a climate-control function might have been tempting, I don't think I would have swapped the Amazon for its Africa-based counterpart which, in my opinion, was far more fun to drive. I imagine that the Amazon is largely bought by families who need it for school runs and overloaded trips from the supermarket. Forgive the cynicism, but their off-road parking is probably about as 'gripped' as it'll get.",

      "body": "<p>Alan Leader has been hearing voices since he was 15. The first time it happened he was in a television shop. He had been upset by images of starving children in Biafra. Now a voice coming from a TV was telling him the famine was his fault, that somehow he was to blame. 'I felt completely bazooka-ed by it,' he recalls. For a year he told no one, afraid of the stigma attached, while the voices grew increasingly distressing. Eventually he was diagnosed as a schizophrenic, spent the next 15 years in and out of psychiatric units, and was put on long-term medication in an effort to staunch the noises in his head. He still hears voices. There are five in all: two are aggressive and often argue with each other, while the others make trivial comments about wallpaper patterns or car number plates. But Leader, 47, who lives in north London, has been out of psychiatric care and off medication for more than 10 years. He has a full-time job, working in mental health services to help others with similar experiences. He has learned to live with his voices and, by accepting them, to control them. 'I wouldn't know what to do without them now. They are part of me,' he says. The idea that voice-hearing can be an acceptable, even enriching, experience is anathema to conventional psychiatrists - and may well strike fear in the minds of the general public, which is used to headlines shrieking that voices 'ordered' someone to kill. Mainstream psychiatrists regard hearing voices as simply a symptom of mental illness, typically schizophrenia, which must be eliminated by medication at all costs. They argue that prolonged exposure to voices is dangerous and strongly discourage discussing what voices say for fear of legitimising them. Nonetheless, the approach of teaching people who hear voices to control the whispers in their ears is fast gathering pace within the NHS. The method was pioneered by a Dutch psychiatrist, Professor Marius Romme, and his journalist partner, Sandra Escher, after they discovered voice-hearers in the late 80s who had never undergone psychiatric treatment and who lived quite happily with their voices. They drew on historical research which throws up a distinguished list of people who claimed to have heard voices, including Socrates, Galileo, Pythagoras and Joan of Arc. Often, the Dutch researchers found, voices begin in childhood. People whose families are more tolerant then are more likely to cope with them in later life. Romme and Escher came to the radical conclusion that hearing voices in itself is not a problem - it is the individual's and society's inability to cope with the phenomenon that causes distress - and set out to teach coping techniques to voice-hearers. Their work has spawned self-help movements in Holland and the UK - the Hearing Voices Network now boasts 80 groups - and challenges the very roots of modern psychiatry.<br>Next month, Romme and Escher visit Britain to run a training course for the mental-health charity Mind, which will teach health professionals in the NHS their controversial techniques. Their latest book, outlining their methods, is published by Mind this summer. Alan Leader first tried the Romme/Escher approach after meeting the pair in the early 90s. Medication had never fully worked for him - although he does not rule out using it again if necessary - and left him overweight, shaking and tired. Now he keeps the voices firmly under control by allowing them a set time every day - between 6pm and 7pm - when they can chatter uninterrupted, avoiding situations that might trigger them at other times, and working on detaching himself from them. He imagines the two argumentative voices as the moaning old men in The Muppet Show. 'I would rather live with them and feel alive,' he says, 'than be medicated up to the eyeballs and emotionally dead.' Others are also using the techniques to live in harmony with their voices. Ron Coleman was 25 when he heard his first voice: it was that of a priest, who had abused him at 11, telling him he should burn in hell. His first reaction was to 'get bladdered'. But as the voice grew more persistent, he drank more, lost his job and his house. He spent six of the next nine years in psychiatric units, where he was forcibly medicated and underwent 40 bouts of ECT. Nothing dimmed the voices - the drugs don't work for a sizeable minority - until he met Romme and Escher and tried their approach. It was the first time anyone had attempted to make sense of what his voices were saying. 'For me it was very much about the fact that I hadn't dealt with certain issues,' he says. Now Coleman, 41, who lives in Gloucester, hears seven voices but controls them sufficiently to work full time as a freelance trainer in mental health care. He has taken no medication for seven years. Sue Mayhew, who is 36 and lives in Gloucestershire, has also come to terms with her voices and even believes they saved her life. She first suffered a breakdown when she was 19 after losing a baby in a cot death. It was during a second breakdown that she first heard them. She was about to throw herself off a multi-storey car park when a chorus of voices - she thought of them then as angels - pulled her back. The third breakdown occurred just after the birth of her daughter, now nine, but since then she has had no more psychiatric episodes. She still hears voices occasionally, and takes low-dose medication to diminish them, but treats them as she would background noise in a pub, picking them up or ignoring them as she pleases. Mayhew believes psychiatrists should be more open-minded towards voices. 'I think it is about time they started to listen to their patients and have a bit more humility when it comes to admitting that they don't know everything they claim to know about the manifestations of the human psyche.' But the whole approach rings alarm bells for Dr Cosmo Hallstrom, consultant psychiatrist at the private Charter Clinic in London, and a member of the public education committee of the Royal College of Psychiatrists. He finds the idea of training NHS staff in the Dutch methods 'scary'. 'We spend an awful lot of time trying to persuade people to have treatment. For someone to come along and say, \"Live with your voices\" is not very helpful,' he says. 'I think untreated schizophrenia is dangerous, and the longer you delay treatment, the worse the outcome.' Yet Dr Phil Taylor, a consultant psychiatrist in Bradford, believes that suppressing people's voices with drugs is even more dangerous. He has been successfully helping patients in Bradford to accept their voices for 10 years - including people who are seriously disturbed - and teaches the method to medical and nursing students. Although he still prescribes medication for patients, the aim is to calm, rather than eliminate, their voices, so they can then discuss them and - eventually - learn to live with them. 'I don't think voices are necessarily signs of mental illness,' he says. 'For some people, the experience is brought about by intense distress, and that tends to get them into contact with mental health services.' Incidents of people hearing voices have been documented for more than 2,000 years, says Dr Taylor, who has co-written a book, Voices of Reason, Voices of Insanity (Routledge, \u00a315.99), which analyses the phenomenon throughout history. Socrates heard a 'daemon' which advised him where to walk, while Galileo heard the voice of his dead daughter, it reveals. Only recently has the hearing of voices been interpreted as a sign of mental illness, while in some cultures the experience is revered. When children of the Xhosa people in southern Africa hear voices, they are trained as healers, the book notes. Dr Taylor believes that more people here would admit to hearing voices, too, but for the social taboo. His research shows that voices rarely give orders; most are actually mundane. People who blame violent acts on their voices are still responsible for their own actions, he argues. In fact, violence is rarely associated with schizophrenia. The number of homicides committed by people with a mental illness has stayed at the same low level for 10 years, while total homicides have risen. And while orthodox psychiatrists still object to the new approach, there are signs of growing sympathy in the NHS for more flexibility towards hearing voices. Professor Julian Leff, of the Institute of Psychiatry, thinks that there has been 'a sea change in attitudes towards this experience. As studies reveal how common voice-hearing really is, it can no longer be regarded as \"abnormal\".' One sign of acceptance, he says, is the growth in treating schizophrenia with cognitive behavioural therapy, where psychologists discuss with patients what their voices say and gently challenge them - although this is still rarely available on the NHS. The vast majority of people who hear voices today are still treated by psychiatrists who refuse to discuss what the voices say. Professor Leff believes that 'if a person experiencing voices doesn't find them difficult to live with, and isn't impelled towards dangerous acts like suicide or homicide by them, who are we to say that they should be got rid of?'</p> <p><b>Hearing voices</b></p> <p>* Between 0.5 and 4 per cent of people regularly hear voices.</p> <p>* Nearly half of people who are recently bereaved report hearing, seeing or feeling the person who has died.</p> <p>* The Dutch psychiatrist, Professor Marius Romme, estimates that only one-third of voice-hearers seek professional help.</p> <p>* Conventional psychiatrists generally view voice-hearing as a sign of mental illness, typically schizophrenia.</p> <p><b> Schizophrenia</b></p> <p>* About one in 100 people is diagnosed with schizophrenia at some point in their lives.

They drew on historical research which throws up a distinguished list of people who claimed to have heard voices, including Socrates, Galileo, Pythagoras and Joan of Arc. Often, the Dutch researchers found, voices begin in childhood. People whose families are more tolerant then are more likely to cope with them in later life. Romme and Escher came to the radical conclusion that hearing voices in itself is not a problem - it is the individual's and society's inability to cope with the phenomenon that causes distress - and set out to teach coping techniques to voice-hearers. Their work has spawned self-help movements in Holland and the UK - the Hearing Voices Network now boasts 80 groups - and challenges the very roots of modern psychiatry. Next month, Romme and Escher visit Britain to run a training course for the mental-health charity Mind, which will teach health professionals in the NHS their controversial techniques. Their latest book, outlining their methods, is published by Mind this summer. Alan Leader first tried the Romme/Escher approach after meeting the pair in the early 90s. Medication had never fully worked for him - although he does not rule out using it again if necessary - and left him overweight, shaking and tired. Now he keeps the voices firmly under control by allowing them a set time every day - between 6pm and 7pm - when they can chatter uninterrupted, avoiding situations that might trigger them at other times, and working on detaching himself from them. He imagines the two argumentative voices as the moaning old men in The Muppet Show. 'I would rather live with them and feel alive,' he says, 'than be medicated up to the eyeballs and emotionally dead.' Others are also using the techniques to live in harmony with their voices. Ron Coleman was 25 when he heard his first voice: it was that of a priest, who had abused him at 11, telling him he should burn in hell. His first reaction was to 'get bladdered'. But as the voice grew more persistent, he drank more, lost his job and his house. He spent six of the next nine years in psychiatric units, where he was forcibly medicated and underwent 40 bouts of ECT. Nothing dimmed the voices - the drugs don't work for a sizeable minority - until he met Romme and Escher and tried their approach. It was the first time anyone had attempted to make sense of what his voices were saying. 'For me it was very much about the fact that I hadn't dealt with certain issues,' he says. Now Coleman, 41, who lives in Gloucester, hears seven voices but controls them sufficiently to work full time as a freelance trainer in mental health care. He has taken no medication for seven years. Sue Mayhew, who is 36 and lives in Gloucestershire, has also come to terms with her voices and even believes they saved her life. She first suffered a breakdown when she was 19 after losing a baby in a cot death. It was during a second breakdown that she first heard them. She was about to throw herself off a multi-storey car park when a chorus of voices - she thought of them then as angels - pulled her back. The third breakdown occurred just after the birth of her daughter, now nine, but since then she has had no more psychiatric episodes. She still hears voices occasionally, and takes low-dose medication to diminish them, but treats them as she would background noise in a pub, picking them up or ignoring them as she pleases. Mayhew believes psychiatrists should be more open-minded towards voices. 'I think it is about time they started to listen to their patients and have a bit more humility when it comes to admitting that they don't know everything they claim to know about the manifestations of the human psyche.' But the whole approach rings alarm bells for Dr Cosmo Hallstrom, consultant psychiatrist at the private Charter Clinic in London, and a member of the public education committee of the Royal College of Psychiatrists. He finds the idea of training NHS staff in the Dutch methods 'scary'. 'We spend an awful lot of time trying to persuade people to have treatment. For someone to come along and say, \"Live with your voices\" is not very helpful,' he says. 'I think untreated schizophrenia is dangerous, and the longer you delay treatment, the worse the outcome.' Yet Dr Phil Taylor, a consultant psychiatrist in Bradford, believes that suppressing people's voices with drugs is even more dangerous. He has been successfully helping patients in Bradford to accept their voices for 10 years - including people who are seriously disturbed - and teaches the method to medical and nursing students. Although he still prescribes medication for patients, the aim is to calm, rather than eliminate, their voices, so they can then discuss them and - eventually - learn to live with them. 'I don't think voices are necessarily signs of mental illness,' he says. 'For some people, the experience is brought about by intense distress, and that tends to get them into contact with mental health services.' Incidents of people hearing voices have been documented for more than 2,000 years, says Dr Taylor, who has co-written a book, Voices of Reason, Voices of Insanity (Routledge, \u00a315.99), which analyses the phenomenon throughout history. Socrates heard a 'daemon' which advised him where to walk, while Galileo heard the voice of his dead daughter, it reveals. Only recently has the hearing of voices been interpreted as a sign of mental illness, while in some cultures the experience is revered. When children of the Xhosa people in southern Africa hear voices, they are trained as healers, the book notes. Dr Taylor believes that more people here would admit to hearing voices, too, but for the social taboo. His research shows that voices rarely give orders; most are actually mundane. People who blame violent acts on their voices are still responsible for their own actions, he argues. In fact, violence is rarely associated with schizophrenia. The number of homicides committed by people with a mental illness has stayed at the same low level for 10 years, while total homicides have risen. And while orthodox psychiatrists still object to the new approach, there are signs of growing sympathy in the NHS for more flexibility towards hearing voices. Professor Julian Leff, of the Institute of Psychiatry, thinks that there has been 'a sea change in attitudes towards this experience. As studies reveal how common voice-hearing really is, it can no longer be regarded as \"abnormal\".' One sign of acceptance, he says, is the growth in treating schizophrenia with cognitive behavioural therapy, where psychologists discuss with patients what their voices say and gently challenge them - although this is still rarely available on the NHS. The vast majority of people who hear voices today are still treated by psychiatrists who refuse to discuss what the voices say. Professor Leff believes that 'if a person experiencing voices doesn't find them difficult to live with, and isn't impelled towards dangerous acts like suicide or homicide by them, who are we to say that they should be got rid of?' Hearing voices * Between 0.5 and 4 per cent of people regularly hear voices. * Nearly half of people who are recently bereaved report hearing, seeing or feeling the person who has died. * The Dutch psychiatrist, Professor Marius Romme, estimates that only one-third of voice-hearers seek professional help. * Conventional psychiatrists generally view voice-hearing as a sign of mental illness, typically schizophrenia. Schizophrenia * About one in 100 people is diagnosed with schizophrenia at some point in their lives. The condition is highly controversial. There is no known cause and no laboratory test exists for diagnosis. Some radical psychiatrists argue it is an artificial label - it does not exist - while others believe it is due to chemical changes in the brain. Symptoms * Thought disruption * Hallucinations * Delusions and apathy * Most people are diagnosed as young adults. About a third have one episode and recover, another third have further occasional episodes, while the remaining third live with schizophrenia. * Schizophrenia doesn't denote a split personality and sufferers are rarely violent. Treatment * Antipsychotics or neuroleptics are effective for many people but some have serious side-effects. Seek professional help before you stop medication. * Counselling or cognitive behavioural therapy - help but are not widely available.

      "body": "<p>I intended to devote the whole of this column to an issue that can seriously dampen the initial euphoria about becoming pregnant - the dreaded morning sickness, but I've just had a call from a friend saying how sick to the stomach she felt on her way to work. For her, there was no joyful reason that could compensate for the nausea, only work and stress.</p> <p>Her call reminded me of when, as a child, I used to hate going to school (where I was bullied) and my fear manifested itself as a deep-seated sickness - it was a battle to get through breakfast without rushing to the loo. Of course pregnancy, hormone-induced sickness has a different physiological make-up and can also have more serious consequences. If a mother doesn't eat, she not only loses out, her baby can suffer in extreme cases, especially if the morning turns into the afternoon and evening which is not as uncommon as it sounds. Some of my patients feel sick the whole time - they'd see 'morning' sickness as a luxury. It has to be said, though, that in the majority of cases your baby will not be harmed because your baby sucks nutrients from your body for a long time, it's you who will become nutritionally compromised and drained.</p> <p>Most women have good and bad days, but if you haven't kept any food down for more than a day or are worried, do seek the advice of your doctor, they'll be able to check on both of you. Morning sickness is caused by a large amount of reproductive hormones circulating during the first trimester; luckily once that passes, the sickness subsides and you can get back to normal eating habits.</p> <p>Anxiety-related nausea is usually due to a large amount of adrenaline flowing around the body, but whatever is causing your sickness - baby, work or school, there are things you can try to help it disappear.</p> <p>First, check your iron supplement. Some women may be taking a supplement which can be responsible for nausea, in which case check with your doctor before stopping - you might like to consider taking a herbal iron supplement called Floradix as, in my experience, this tends not to cause nausea. But if you have to stop the supplement, ensure your diet is full of iron-rich foods - lean red meat, green leafy vegetables, etc. Remember pregnant women should not eat liver (a useful source of iron in other situations), as it contains too much vitamin A.</p> <p>Eating small meals often is much better than going for longer periods without eating. It can be tempting not to eat when you feel sick, but if you can manage a little something it's better than having an empty, acid-full stomach - starving only makes your blood sugar drop, which can make you feel sick.</p> <p>The foods to go towards are the carbohydrate-rich ones - bread, plain biscuits, a crisp bread, or a little pasta, rice or potatoes. A bowl of simple pasta with a little cheese and a dash of olive oil can sit well - but, as with soups, don't overload on the creamy sauces. Fatty foods are hard to digest and tend to sit heavily in the stomach. Fat also causes the muscle rings around the top of the stomach to temporarily weaken - which can cause you to vomit.</p> <p>Keep a stock of biscuits in a tin by your bed; it helps to nibble one before you get up in the morning. Ginger biscuits are particularly good, as ginger is one of the most settling plants. Ginger makes a good anti-nausea tea, too. Just place a very thin slice of fresh root ginger in a cup; add boiling water and leave to infuse for a few minutes. Remove the ginger and drink in small sips - gulps can aggravate nausea.</p> <p>Avoid caffeine in all forms as it also aggravates nausea. If you're not hot on ginger, peppermint and camomile tea are very soothing, as is jasmine. The Chinese, among others, believe in rice water which can work wonders. Save the hot water in which you've cooked the rice and take small sips. Fizzy drinks can go down well, ginger beer or sparkling water with sliced fresh lime are good for starters.</p> <p>When it comes to non-pregnancy-related sickness, which is frequently caused by adrenaline, it's best to stick to foods which don't take a lot of preparation.

      "bodyText": "I intended to devote the whole of this column to an issue that can seriously dampen the initial euphoria about becoming pregnant - the dreaded morning sickness, but I've just had a call from a friend saying how sick to the stomach she felt on her way to work. For her, there was no joyful reason that could compensate for the nausea, only work and stress. Her call reminded me of when, as a child, I used to hate going to school (where I was bullied) and my fear manifested itself as a deep-seated sickness - it was a battle to get through breakfast without rushing to the loo. Of course pregnancy, hormone-induced sickness has a different physiological make-up and can also have more serious consequences. If a mother doesn't eat, she not only loses out, her baby can suffer in extreme cases, especially if the morning turns into the afternoon and evening which is not as uncommon as it sounds. Some of my patients feel sick the whole time - they'd see 'morning' sickness as a luxury. It has to be said, though, that in the majority of cases your baby will not be harmed because your baby sucks nutrients from your body for a long time, it's you who will become nutritionally compromised and drained. Most women have good and bad days, but if you haven't kept any food down for more than a day or are worried, do seek the advice of your doctor, they'll be able to check on both of you. Morning sickness is caused by a large amount of reproductive hormones circulating during the first trimester; luckily once that passes, the sickness subsides and you can get back to normal eating habits. Anxiety-related nausea is usually due to a large amount of adrenaline flowing around the body, but whatever is causing your sickness - baby, work or school, there are things you can try to help it disappear. First, check your iron supplement. Some women may be taking a supplement which can be responsible for nausea, in which case check with your doctor before stopping - you might like to consider taking a herbal iron supplement called Floradix as, in my experience, this tends not to cause nausea. But if you have to stop the supplement, ensure your diet is full of iron-rich foods - lean red meat, green leafy vegetables, etc. Remember pregnant women should not eat liver (a useful source of iron in other situations), as it contains too much vitamin A. Eating small meals often is much better than going for longer periods without eating. It can be tempting not to eat when you feel sick, but if you can manage a little something it's better than having an empty, acid-full stomach - starving only makes your blood sugar drop, which can make you feel sick. The foods to go towards are the carbohydrate-rich ones - bread, plain biscuits, a crisp bread, or a little pasta, rice or potatoes. A bowl of simple pasta with a little cheese and a dash of olive oil can sit well - but, as with soups, don't overload on the creamy sauces. Fatty foods are hard to digest and tend to sit heavily in the stomach. Fat also causes the muscle rings around the top of the stomach to temporarily weaken - which can cause you to vomit. Keep a stock of biscuits in a tin by your bed; it helps to nibble one before you get up in the morning. Ginger biscuits are particularly good, as ginger is one of the most settling plants. Ginger makes a good anti-nausea tea, too. Just place a very thin slice of fresh root ginger in a cup; add boiling water and leave to infuse for a few minutes. Remove the ginger and drink in small sips - gulps can aggravate nausea. Avoid caffeine in all forms as it also aggravates nausea. If you're not hot on ginger, peppermint and camomile tea are very soothing, as is jasmine. The Chinese, among others, believe in rice water which can work wonders. Save the hot water in which you've cooked the rice and take small sips. Fizzy drinks can go down well, ginger beer or sparkling water with sliced fresh lime are good for starters. When it comes to non-pregnancy-related sickness, which is frequently caused by adrenaline, it's best to stick to foods which don't take a lot of preparation. Don't start making scrambled eggs in the morning, stick to some toast or a bowl of cereal. Some people find the temperature of foods makes a difference - I used to hate hot food and all I could manage was a cold yoghurt with honey - so try to experiment with the type of food. Some people find milk sits horribly when they're feeling anxious, in which case stick to toast. If you really can't face breakfast, or you can't get an anxious child to eat any, you should carry a snack with you to work or school - a few ginger biscuits, crackers or dried fruits to nibble on will help keep your energy up and get you to lunchtime. If your sickness continues throughout the day, as with pregnancy nausea, go towards the carbohydrate foods - potato, rice, bread, pasta, etc - rather than fried, sugary or protein-rich foods.

      "body": "<p>I 'm not sure whether I was Francis Bacon's concierge or his butler, but intrusive strangers certainly believed that I had the entr\u00e9e to his domain. I used to get calls from famous photographers saying that they were great fans of my writing and could they take my picture. I knew what was coming if I didn't speedily decline. 'Would it by any chance be possible to photograph you in Francis Bacon's studio and then perhaps do the two of you together if he happens to be there at the time?' The comedy of being importuned in this way was a nice bonus for having done a book called Interviews with Francis Bacon, which had been widely translated.</p> <p>My relationship with Bacon began in 1942, when I was 17 and had just become interested in painting. One of the books I absorbed was Herbert Read's Art Now , a veritable bible first published in 1933. It reproduced a Crucifixion, painted that year by a young artist with the name of the great Elizabethan writer, and this painting therefore stayed in my mind, although the artist had disappeared from view. But at the end of the war, new works by him started to appear in galleries. They were sensationally disturbing and widely considered worthy of the Chamber of Horrors.</p> <p>It was in 1949 that I realised he was not only an arresting image-maker but very much a painter, and I started saying so in print. I also met him by chance and was soon seeing a good deal of him. In 1951, I was asked to give a talk about his art for the BBC's Third Programme , my first substantial radio talk. I described him as the most important living painter, by which I didn't mean he was the greatest, but the most relevant to the age. I was told afterwards that Harman Grisewood, head of the Third Programme , swore that it would be a long time before I did another talk for them.</p> <p>Bacon and I became quite close friends. We drank and dined together, went dog racing together and shared off-course bets on horses. I also sat for him a few times, helped him to write a short piece in praise of an older artist, Matthew Smith, and acted as his agent in selling works to dealers behind his accredited dealer's back when he urgently needed cash. I idolised him as a man - this never stopped - and until 1956, I loved his work unreservedly. But I thought it then took a wrong turn and I became rather alienated from his current production. I was also put off by the way he jeered at the work of abstract painters such as Jackson Pollock: my own pantheon had plenty of room for them both.</p> <p>So between 1957 and 1962 I stopped writing about him; nor did we see much of each other. In 1962 he had a retrospective at the Tate, and as art critic of the New Statesman , I had to review it at length. I wrote with admiration but reservations and dismissed the work of the past few years, but concluded that he had returned to form in his latest piece, a big Crucifixion triptych.</p> <p>Shortly after, the BBC radio Talks producer, Leonie Cohn, who had commissioned that 1951 talk and had lately got me to do interviews with several American Abstract Expressionists and also with Stanley Kubrick, asked me to interview Bacon. I said I wasn't sure whether Bacon would agree, as he didn't readily give interviews and may not have liked my review of his show. But he did agree, and the result was brilliant, producing passages endlessly quoted since, such as: 'What is fascinating now is that it's going to be much more difficult for the artist, because he must deepen the game to be any good at all.'</p> <p><b> Four years later I was asked by Michael </b> Gill<b> </b> to interview Bacon in a BBC TV film he was making. This time we were quite aggressive at moments. I asked tougher questions than last time and he accused me of liking abstract art because I was a slave to fashion. But we were now seeing a lot of each other again and we were both saying that it would be interesting to do more interviews, especially if we could talk as we did among friends, without having to think of a lay audience. So we did some private recordings at my flat and then we decided to publish a book of interviews. This happened in 1975, and Graham Greene wrote that it was 'an exciting document which can rank with the journals of Delacroix and the letters of Gauguin'.</p> <p>We went on recording interviews, some for ourselves, some for TV, one for an audio company. We published an enlarged edition of the book in 1980 and a further enlarged one in 1987. Meanwhile, they got translated into about 10 languages; I don't know whether any of the translators managed to create an equivalent for the amazing vividness and rhythmic power of Bacon's talk. The reason we went on doing interviews for about 25 years was that Bacon loved getting in- volved in theoretical talk about art. This is a rare thing in English artists, who tend to poke fun at a custom so French. And it's a key aspect of Bacon's personality which is not sufficiently emphasised in most accounts of the man.</p> <p>His love of talking about art made the recordings easy. The hard part was the editing. Interviews with artists, even when they have Bacon's turn of phrase, tend to sprawl and repeat themselves; I wanted the printed version to be economical in exposition and coherent in structure. I therefore did most of the editing in collaboration with Shena Mackay, whose work as a fiction writer suggested that she was the ideal person to help to achieve that.</p> <p>Now, if one is aiming for structural coherence, a lot of the best things said are not going to fit in anywhere; so they get left, so to speak, on the cutting-room floor. I was always aware how much was being lost in this way and had it in mind to return to the transcripts, retrieve some of the best rejected bits and publish them torn from their context as fragments of talk. The ones that follow are The Observer 's selection from my selection.</p> <p><b> Bacon on bacon</b></p> <p><b>Francis Bacon</b> I love watching the idiocy of other people, and of myself. And they can watch my idiocy. <b>David Sylvester</b> People you know and people you don't know, passing people? <b>FB</b> Yes. I love passing people. I love going to towns and places where I know nobody at all but very quickly talk to them. It's so easy to talk to them. <b>DS</b> You can't really imagine living outside of town, can you? <b>FB</b> I can't imagine lying on the seashore, for instance, for hours, like people can do, with the dumb satisfaction that the sun is shining on them. That I couldn't do at all. <b>DS</b> And what about, say, moving to the country to work? <b>FB</b> That would be impossible for me. <b>DS</b> Why's that? <b>FB</b> Because I like crowds. I mean, I'd rather be in a station than in the country. [1975]</p> <p><b>DS</b> Do you at all enjoy the kind of star quality which you have always had when moving among people? <b>FB</b> That's a thing that you are not conscious of yourself at all. I have no idea of what impression I make on other people. <b>DS</b> You have not been conscious that, when you come into a bar, you immediately become the centre of attention? That is something I have seen happen ever since I have known you, which means before you became famous as a painter, so it wasn't influenced by that. <b>FB</b> Perhaps I was drunk and garrulous, had a lot to say. I think it can only be for that reason. I certainly am not conscious of those things. This is not false modesty; I am just not conscious of it. [1984]</p> <p><b>DS</b> Did you go to the theatre when you were younger? <b>FB</b> I drifted from bar to bar. <b>DS</b> And when did you start gambling seriously? <b>FB</b> Well, I have always been brought up with it, because when we were very young, we used to be sent to the local post office to put on bets. So, as I was brought up in that sort of atmosphere in Ireland of everybody gambling, I suppose that that influenced me. I don't know. Perhaps I would have been a gambler in any case. [1984]</p> <p><b>DS</b> It's often said about you by hostile critics that your work reflects a feeling of disgust about human beings and of self-disgust. <b>FB</b> Well, I may have, I may very often be very discontented and loathe myself but I'm not trying to bring that out. In any way whatsoever. Nor have I a disgust with life. Life is all we have. I mean, here we are for a moment. [1984]</p> <p><b>Bacon on religion</b></p> <p><b>FB</b> Of course one knows how very potent some of the images of Christianity have been and how they must have played very deeply on one's sensibility. And after all, one believes in the ethics of Christianity, or a great number of them, without actually believing in the practice of the Church. <b>DS</b> You believe in the ethics of Christianity? <b>FB</b> Well, I think that they are a carry-over of Greek ethics really, and I think that so far a better code of ethics for the Western world hasn't yet been found, though of course the religious side of it is something I can't accept. <b>DS</b> But then at the heart of Christianity is the idea of salvation and of a life after this life in which one gets punishment or reward for what one has done here. <b>FB</b> I think you can accept the ethics without believing that the good you do will be rewarded or the evil you do will be punished. [1966]</p> <p><b>Bacon on work</b></p> <p><b>FB</b> The only thing that really keeps me going on is that I want to work - but work, I may say, for no reason. I just work; it still excites me to work. You see, unless you have religious feelings or something of that kind, how can you not think that life is totally futile - and becomes more so with age, because it hasn't got the pleasures of youth? Probably the only thing, although I know it has no meaning, is that I like working. I like the possibilities of invention and the possibilities of something happening. Not because I think they've got any value, but because they excite me. [1979]</p> <p><b>FB</b> I know that teaching is one of the methods by which many artists survive, but how can you teach? In a period when there is no tradition, there is nothing to teach. You can teach your own attitude. The only thing that I can understand for art schools would be for them to have a few extremely intelligent people whom the people who are striving to be artists of some kind can come and discuss their problems with... But many people have to teach because they can't make the money out of their work. In my own case, even when I could earn no money, I never taught. Except that once a friend went to the West Indies and he asked me to take his job for three months at the Royal College of Art, which I did. It's true to say that I did it very badly. I didn't often go there; there was nothing I could teach them whatsoever. <b>DS</b> And what effect did that have upon your own work? Did you feel it was just using energy which you needed for your own work, or...? <b>FB</b> Not especially, because it was only for three months. Otherwise I would never have done it. I'd rather go out and just do a job working. After all, I can cook, I can clean floors, I can earn my money that way. It would use physical energy, which would be so much more interesting than mental energy. Because I've got plenty of mental energy, because I never stop thinking, myself. After all, I think about painting. Not that I think thinking finally helps, and yet it does. [1975]</p> <p><b>Bacon on books</b></p> <p>DS What are you mostly reading nowadays? <b>FB</b> Well, you know, I read generally the same thing over and over again. I very often read translations of Aeschylus; I read Proust; I read anything that comes to my hand. Or any rubbish as well. <b>DS</b> What rubbish do you read? <b>FB</b> Well, most things are rubbish. So I can't tell you exactly what rubbish. There are piles of rubbish and very little stuff that is any good. <b>DS</b> Do you read Shakespeare a lot? <b>FB</b> I read a certain amount, yes. I'll tell you what I really read: things which bring up images for me. And I find that this happens very much with the translations of Aeschylus, and with Eliot. For some reason I read them, and when I read them another time, a different image comes up. I mean, I don't say that these images are really to do with the poems of Eliot or even with the plays of Shakespeare, but they open up the valves of sensation for me and so images drop in like that from reading those things. It could happen just as easily from reading any of the trash. So it doesn't really make much difference. Except that I'm less bored by those than I am by the trash. <b>DS</b> In the same way that you can be influenced by a news photograph or you can be influenced by Velazquez? <b>FB</b> Exactly. Exactly. Exactly. [1984]</p> <p><b>Bacon on michelangelo</b></p> <p><b>FB</b> Do you think Michelangelo was an erotic artist or not? <b>DS</b> Very. But almost embarrassingly. I find the Slaves almost embarrassing in the longing they conveyed for these boys. <b>FB</b> He was, after the Greeks, the great male voluptuary, wasn't he? He made the male body really voluptuous. <b>DS</b> But with the Greeks, you feel that the artist has had these boys, and with Michelangelo, that he'd just longed for them. And that's one reason why I find there's a morbid quality in Michelangelo which doesn't stop him from being the greatest artist of our civilisation. <b>FB</b> I think that Michelangelo, from what one knows about all of his history, had a deeply morbid side to him. But it's more voluptuous than the Greeks. Because I think in those Slaves the longing is more poignant than anything you find in Greek art. [1973]</p> <p><b>Bacon on cricket</b></p> <p>DS As to working from documentary photographs, one interesting case of this was your recent use of a photograph of David Gower batting: you translated the pads to the legs of a headless male nude. <b>FB</b> Well, I have often seen cricket, and cricket is such an important game in this country, I am very conscious of it.

They're deformed cricket pads, in any case. <b>DS</b> I take it that your attitude to bringing in the cricket pads was rather like the attitude you took about 20 years ago when you brought that armband with a swastika into a Crucifixion triptych. When I asked you whether the presence of the swastika had a meaning for you and also whether you were concerned that people might take it to have a meaning, you said the swastika was there simply because the armband had been in the photograph you'd used and you'd put it in without thinking about how it might be interpreted. Did you have the same attitude to bringing in the cricket pads? <b>FB</b> It wasn't quite the same. You see, with those enormous crowds that have so often been filmed and photographed at the Nuremberg rallies, I had seen all these people, and they all had armbands on with the swastikas on them, and I wanted that in this image: it was stupid to put in the swastika, but there it is. I didn't think about it, I didn't think that people would interpret it all the different ways they have. But with the cricket pads, I didn't put them in because I am particularly interested in cricket; I did so because it made the image more real. [1982]</p>",

      "bodyText": "I 'm not sure whether I was Francis Bacon's concierge or his butler, but intrusive strangers certainly believed that I had the entr\u00e9e to his domain. I used to get calls from famous photographers saying that they were great fans of my writing and could they take my picture. I knew what was coming if I didn't speedily decline. 'Would it by any chance be possible to photograph you in Francis Bacon's studio and then perhaps do the two of you together if he happens to be there at the time?' The comedy of being importuned in this way was a nice bonus for having done a book called Interviews with Francis Bacon, which had been widely translated. My relationship with Bacon began in 1942, when I was 17 and had just become interested in painting. One of the books I absorbed was Herbert Read's Art Now , a veritable bible first published in 1933. It reproduced a Crucifixion, painted that year by a young artist with the name of the great Elizabethan writer, and this painting therefore stayed in my mind, although the artist had disappeared from view. But at the end of the war, new works by him started to appear in galleries. They were sensationally disturbing and widely considered worthy of the Chamber of Horrors. It was in 1949 that I realised he was not only an arresting image-maker but very much a painter, and I started saying so in print. I also met him by chance and was soon seeing a good deal of him. In 1951, I was asked to give a talk about his art for the BBC's Third Programme , my first substantial radio talk. I described him as the most important living painter, by which I didn't mean he was the greatest, but the most relevant to the age. I was told afterwards that Harman Grisewood, head of the Third Programme , swore that it would be a long time before I did another talk for them. Bacon and I became quite close friends. We drank and dined together, went dog racing together and shared off-course bets on horses. I also sat for him a few times, helped him to write a short piece in praise of an older artist, Matthew Smith, and acted as his agent in selling works to dealers behind his accredited dealer's back when he urgently needed cash. I idolised him as a man - this never stopped - and until 1956, I loved his work unreservedly. But I thought it then took a wrong turn and I became rather alienated from his current production. I was also put off by the way he jeered at the work of abstract painters such as Jackson Pollock: my own pantheon had plenty of room for them both. So between 1957 and 1962 I stopped writing about him; nor did we see much of each other. In 1962 he had a retrospective at the Tate, and as art critic of the New Statesman , I had to review it at length. I wrote with admiration but reservations and dismissed the work of the past few years, but concluded that he had returned to form in his latest piece, a big Crucifixion triptych. Shortly after, the BBC radio Talks producer, Leonie Cohn, who had commissioned that 1951 talk and had lately got me to do interviews with several American Abstract Expressionists and also with Stanley Kubrick, asked me to interview Bacon. I said I wasn't sure whether Bacon would agree, as he didn't readily give interviews and may not have liked my review of his show. But he did agree, and the result was brilliant, producing passages endlessly quoted since, such as: 'What is fascinating now is that it's going to be much more difficult for the artist, because he must deepen the game to be any good at all.' Four years later I was asked by Michael Gill to interview Bacon in a BBC TV film he was making. This time we were quite aggressive at moments. I asked tougher questions than last time and he accused me of liking abstract art because I was a slave to fashion. But we were now seeing a lot of each other again and we were both saying that it would be interesting to do more interviews, especially if we could talk as we did among friends, without having to think of a lay audience. So we did some private recordings at my flat and then we decided to publish a book of interviews. This happened in 1975, and Graham Greene wrote that it was 'an exciting document which can rank with the journals of Delacroix and the letters of Gauguin'. We went on recording interviews, some for ourselves, some for TV, one for an audio company. We published an enlarged edition of the book in 1980 and a further enlarged one in 1987. Meanwhile, they got translated into about 10 languages; I don't know whether any of the translators managed to create an equivalent for the amazing vividness and rhythmic power of Bacon's talk. The reason we went on doing interviews for about 25 years was that Bacon loved getting in- volved in theoretical talk about art. This is a rare thing in English artists, who tend to poke fun at a custom so French. And it's a key aspect of Bacon's personality which is not sufficiently emphasised in most accounts of the man. His love of talking about art made the recordings easy. The hard part was the editing. Interviews with artists, even when they have Bacon's turn of phrase, tend to sprawl and repeat themselves; I wanted the printed version to be economical in exposition and coherent in structure. I therefore did most of the editing in collaboration with Shena Mackay, whose work as a fiction writer suggested that she was the ideal person to help to achieve that. Now, if one is aiming for structural coherence, a lot of the best things said are not going to fit in anywhere; so they get left, so to speak, on the cutting-room floor. I was always aware how much was being lost in this way and had it in mind to return to the transcripts, retrieve some of the best rejected bits and publish them torn from their context as fragments of talk. The ones that follow are The Observer 's selection from my selection. Bacon on bacon Francis Bacon I love watching the idiocy of other people, and of myself. And they can watch my idiocy. David Sylvester People you know and people you don't know, passing people? FB Yes. I love passing people. I love going to towns and places where I know nobody at all but very quickly talk to them. It's so easy to talk to them. DS You can't really imagine living outside of town, can you? FB I can't imagine lying on the seashore, for instance, for hours, like people can do, with the dumb satisfaction that the sun is shining on them. That I couldn't do at all. DS And what about, say, moving to the country to work? FB That would be impossible for me. DS Why's that? FB Because I like crowds. I mean, I'd rather be in a station than in the country. [1975] DS Do you at all enjoy the kind of star quality which you have always had when moving among people? FB That's a thing that you are not conscious of yourself at all. I have no idea of what impression I make on other people. DS You have not been conscious that, when you come into a bar, you immediately become the centre of attention? That is something I have seen happen ever since I have known you, which means before you became famous as a painter, so it wasn't influenced by that. FB Perhaps I was drunk and garrulous, had a lot to say. I think it can only be for that reason. I certainly am not conscious of those things. This is not false modesty; I am just not conscious of it. [1984] DS Did you go to the theatre when you were younger? FB I drifted from bar to bar. DS And when did you start gambling seriously? FB Well, I have always been brought up with it, because when we were very young, we used to be sent to the local post office to put on bets. So, as I was brought up in that sort of atmosphere in Ireland of everybody gambling, I suppose that that influenced me. I don't know. Perhaps I would have been a gambler in any case. [1984] DS It's often said about you by hostile critics that your work reflects a feeling of disgust about human beings and of self-disgust. FB Well, I may have, I may very often be very discontented and loathe myself but I'm not trying to bring that out. In any way whatsoever. Nor have I a disgust with life. Life is all we have. I mean, here we are for a moment. [1984] Bacon on religion FB Of course one knows how very potent some of the images of Christianity have been and how they must have played very deeply on one's sensibility. And after all, one believes in the ethics of Christianity, or a great number of them, without actually believing in the practice of the Church. DS You believe in the ethics of Christianity? FB Well, I think that they are a carry-over of Greek ethics really, and I think that so far a better code of ethics for the Western world hasn't yet been found, though of course the religious side of it is something I can't accept. DS But then at the heart of Christianity is the idea of salvation and of a life after this life in which one gets punishment or reward for what one has done here. FB I think you can accept the ethics without believing that the good you do will be rewarded or the evil you do will be punished. [1966] Bacon on work FB The only thing that really keeps me going on is that I want to work - but work, I may say, for no reason. I just work; it still excites me to work. You see, unless you have religious feelings or something of that kind, how can you not think that life is totally futile - and becomes more so with age, because it hasn't got the pleasures of youth? Probably the only thing, although I know it has no meaning, is that I like working. I like the possibilities of invention and the possibilities of something happening. Not because I think they've got any value, but because they excite me. [1979] FB I know that teaching is one of the methods by which many artists survive, but how can you teach? In a period when there is no tradition, there is nothing to teach. You can teach your own attitude. The only thing that I can understand for art schools would be for them to have a few extremely intelligent people whom the people who are striving to be artists of some kind can come and discuss their problems with... But many people have to teach because they can't make the money out of their work. In my own case, even when I could earn no money, I never taught. Except that once a friend went to the West Indies and he asked me to take his job for three months at the Royal College of Art, which I did. It's true to say that I did it very badly. I didn't often go there; there was nothing I could teach them whatsoever. DS And what effect did that have upon your own work? Did you feel it was just using energy which you needed for your own work, or...? FB Not especially, because it was only for three months. Otherwise I would never have done it. I'd rather go out and just do a job working. After all, I can cook, I can clean floors, I can earn my money that way. It would use physical energy, which would be so much more interesting than mental energy. Because I've got plenty of mental energy, because I never stop thinking, myself. After all, I think about painting. Not that I think thinking finally helps, and yet it does. [1975] Bacon on books DS What are you mostly reading nowadays? FB Well, you know, I read generally the same thing over and over again. I very often read translations of Aeschylus; I read Proust; I read anything that comes to my hand. Or any rubbish as well. DS What rubbish do you read? FB Well, most things are rubbish. So I can't tell you exactly what rubbish. There are piles of rubbish and very little stuff that is any good. DS Do you read Shakespeare a lot? FB I read a certain amount, yes. I'll tell you what I really read: things which bring up images for me. And I find that this happens very much with the translations of Aeschylus, and with Eliot. For some reason I read them, and when I read them another time, a different image comes up. I mean, I don't say that these images are really to do with the poems of Eliot or even with the plays of Shakespeare, but they open up the valves of sensation for me and so images drop in like that from reading those things. It could happen just as easily from reading any of the trash. So it doesn't really make much difference. Except that I'm less bored by those than I am by the trash. DS In the same way that you can be influenced by a news photograph or you can be influenced by Velazquez? FB Exactly. Exactly. Exactly. [1984] Bacon on michelangelo FB Do you think Michelangelo was an erotic artist or not? DS Very. But almost embarrassingly. I find the Slaves almost embarrassing in the longing they conveyed for these boys. FB He was, after the Greeks, the great male voluptuary, wasn't he? He made the male body really voluptuous. DS But with the Greeks, you feel that the artist has had these boys, and with Michelangelo, that he'd just longed for them. And that's one reason why I find there's a morbid quality in Michelangelo which doesn't stop him from being the greatest artist of our civilisation. FB I think that Michelangelo, from what one knows about all of his history, had a deeply morbid side to him. But it's more voluptuous than the Greeks. Because I think in those Slaves the longing is more poignant than anything you find in Greek art. [1973] Bacon on cricket DS As to working from documentary photographs, one interesting case of this was your recent use of a photograph of David Gower batting: you translated the pads to the legs of a headless male nude. FB Well, I have often seen cricket, and cricket is such an important game in this country, I am very conscious of it. When I did this image I suddenly said: 'Well, I don't know why, but I think that it's going to strengthen it very much and make it look very much more real if it has cricket pads on it.'

In July 1998, we were offered \u00a3170 for the excess and out-of-pocket expenses, but we have still not received the money. The guilty party's insurer is refusing to reimburse AGF with the car hire charges, which were \u00a31,565 - more than the value of our car.

      "bodyText": "In 1998, I was involved in a traffic accident when the car behind me failed to stop. I sent a claim form to AGF Insurance, who provided a hire car. First they lost my claim, then they lost the assessor's report. Eventually the car was repaired and we paid the \u00a3150 excess. In July 1998, we were offered \u00a3170 for the excess and out-of-pocket expenses, but we have still not received the money. The guilty party's insurer is refusing to reimburse AGF with the car hire charges, which were \u00a31,565 - more than the value of our car. Apparently we have to wait for a ruling from the House of Lords before we can get our \u00a3150 back. Why should we be penalised, particularly as it was my hard work that kept the repair time to five weeks? CL, Royston Arguments between AGF, the other driver's insurer and the car hire company ground to a halt, leaving you stranded. The guilty driver's insurer said AGF had been unnecessarily slow, resulting in excessive hire car costs, which they refused to pay. AGF denied this. Since contacting me, you have received a cheque for \u00a3170 from the other side's solicitors, inexplicably forwarded by the car hire firm. This was before the Lords' judgment, which finally arrived 10 days ago. The court case, Dimond v Lovell, concerned how much insurers should have to pay for cars that the innocent victims of motor accidents hire while theirs are being repaired. Insurers argued that the new credit hire companies in this business charged too much and the Lords decided that insurers had to refund only reasonable car hire costs. Last September, the Association of British Insurers launched a scheme for innocent victims not provided with courtesy cars by their own insurer or the guilty party's. You can get details from www.abi.org.uk/tphire or from car hire firms Enterprise (0800 800227) and National Car Rental (020 8358 9860). Jobless claim: Never valid A year ago I was laid off work and claimed on my redundancy insurance policy with Britannia building society. In December, Britannia wrote saying they were closing the case as they had not heard from me. I told them it was me waiting to hear from them. They then said they would activate my claim by the end of January, but I have heard nothing. AH, Bury St Edmunds You were told that you qualified for payment by call centre staff at Britannia's external administrator, which the society has since dropped. In fact, your claim was never valid because you took a temporary job two days short of the 60-day qualifying period after being made redundant. Britannia says the claims department should not have kept chasing documents when your claim was invalid. The society is making an ex-gratia payment of \u00a3100. Share deal: The true cost I instructed my stockbroker to sell 200 On Line shares. They sent a share transfer form and a request for the share certificate. As we had never received the certificate, we returned the transfer form and went on holiday. On our return, we found letters from my broker saying that as they did not have a share certificate, they would have to buy the shares on the market to close the deal, with a bill for \u00a32,500. I pointed out that there was no need to purchase the shares, as we already owned them. PB, Bushey You did not own the shares once you gave instructions to sell. The deal is done then, even though the share certificate is not due until settlement day, five days later. Unless your shares are in a nominee account, you must produce a certificate. If you do not, Stock Exchange rules allow brokers to buy more shares, so the next buyer has a certificate and they can reclaim the cost from you. Policy mix-up: Delay payment We have an endowment policy with Scottish Life maturing this month, but they said it was assigned to NatWest Bank. I told them it wasn't, but they said I must sort it out myself. I called five different departments at NatWest but none could help. They say another policy is assigned to Alliance &amp; Leicester, which it is not. Surely Scottish Life should be sorting this out? EP, Lenham NatWest has tracked down your file, which shows that the policy was assigned to the bank for a few years but discharged in February 1997. It looks as though NatWest sent the policy back to you without informing Scottish Life, but it has now written to the insurer confirming the facts. Because of the delay, Scottish Life is paying you an extra week's interest, \u00a34.68. The second policy is assigned to Kent Reliance Building Society, but Scottish Life typed in the wrong name when your original lender, Chatham Reliance, amalgamated with the Herne Bay.

'The first Web was invented by British scientists but exported to the United States. Now we have to buy back our access from Microsoft or Netscape. We don't want that to happen again.' This urge to ensure the continued viability of UK science is balanced by warnings that such a system brings closer the day when computers will take over the running of the world and discard humanity. One such gainsayer is Bill Joy, inventor of the web language Java and chief scientist at computer giant Sun Microsystems. 'It is no exaggeration to say we are on the cusp of the further perfection of extreme evil,' he states in the magazine Wired. 'I may be working to create tools which will enable the construction of technology that may replace our species. 'Unable to afford the necessities of life, biological humans would be squeezed out of existence,' he adds. Most researchers disagree, however. 'The issue of consciousness in such a powerful thinking system has to be considered, but that is different from suggesting The Grid would be a threat to Homo sapiens,' said astronomer Dr Paul Murdin. This point was backed by Professor Ian Hillier of the Molecular Environmental Science Centre at Manchester University. 'Just compare this Grid with the national electricity grid. When you switch on the kettle, you have no idea of the vast network that is working to provide power.' Research councils have asked the Government to provide an extra \u00a380 million to help set up the Grid, and a similar amount is being sought from the Department of Trade and Industry to support commercial applications. 'Many countries are thinking about setting up something like the Grid,' added Cambridge scientist Dr Ewan Birney, of the European Bio-infomatics Institute. 'We already have one model system in operation. The Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence organisation is currently searching through radio astronomical signals for intelligible transmission using volunteers' personal computers, and these machines carry out the operations. The Grid will do the same sort of thing - but on a much grander scale.'",

Ten years ago, in August 1990, she became the proud owner of a studio apartment in the Medway Towns, which cost her \u00a339,950. But things soon started to go pear-shaped. Within a year of her moving in, the prices of apartments in her block started to drop, slowly at first and then ever faster. </p> <p>After about two years, owners had begun moving on and properties were either sold or rented out. Diane believes many of the original purchasers had their apartments repossessed. By 1997, the flats were being sold for \u00a315,000, and she was the only owner- occupier left. </p> <p>In 1992, she had approached her lender, the Yorkshire Building Society, to find out what help or advice they could give about her rising negative equity problem. They said they had no policy on negative equity. Realising she had no alternative, she went on paying her mortgage and her endowment premiums to Winterthur. By 1997, she was desperate to move to a larger property. So she went back to the Yorkshire. </p> <p>She says: 'This time they did have leaflets, but they were of no practical use to me. They told me that if I wanted to move, the maximum negative equity I could take with me was \u00a39,000. This was no good because my negative equity was nearly \u00a320,000.' </p> <p>In the end she decided to move out and rent a larger place for herself and find a tenant for her apartment. 'When I told the building society I wanted to let the property, they said they would charge me an extra 1 per cent on my mortgage, and they have done so ever since. They really don't seem to have been interested in helping me at any stage.' </p> <p>Since she started letting out the property she has had tenants at most times, but on one occasion she had to wait four months to find a new one. That is when her credit card bills started mounting, because she was having to pay both her own rent and the mortgage. </p> <p>The recent rise in property prices in the South-east has boosted the value of her apartment, but she believes it is still only worth around \u00a325,000. She would dearly love to get rid of it and buy a small house of her own, but that would cost around \u00a368,000 to \u00a370,000. </p> <p>Her endowment is another disappointment to her. She says the last notification showed it was worth just \u00a35,000, even though it has been running for nearly 10 years. She is waiting to hear whether it is on track to pay off her mortgage at the end of the term, but is pessimistic. </p> <p>Her main priority is to do something about the apartment. 'It has been a real millstone round my neck. It has pulled me off the housing ladder and I would really like to get back on it again.' </p> <p><strong> Adviser 1: Ray Boulger </strong></p> <p>Based on her desire to buy a house for \u00a368,000 to \u00a370,000, Diane's options are limited. </p> <p>It will be impossible to do this without getting outside help or selling her endowment policy. She will lose out if she surrenders her policy, but will just about be able to buy the type of property she desperately wants and get back on the housing ladder. Over the long term, the profit she is likely to make on the house may compensate her for selling her endowment policy. </p> <p>If Diane sells her studio for \u00a325,000, after allowing for costs she will have to find about \u00a312,000 to pay off the mortgage; \u00a35,000 of this could come from the endowment policy, leaving \u00a37,000 to find. She could finance this and refinance her other borrowings of \u00a36,000 with a 10-year personal loan for \u00a313,000. The cheapest lender offering a loan over 10 years at present is NatWest. </p> <p>Her \u00a31,000 savings would almost cover the stamp duty and legal costs, but she would need a 100 per cent mortgage. Northern Rock would lend her up to \u00a367,000 on its Together mortgage. In addition to a reasonable variable interest rate of 7.29 per cent, there are no arrangement fees, no mortgage indemnity guarantee premium, no redemption penalties and no compulsory insurances. </p> <p>Based on current interest rates, her mortgage and loan repayments would be just over half of her net income. She should go ahead only if she is confident she can afford these monthly payments.</p> <p> Ray Boulger works for independent mortgage adviser John Charcol </p> <p><strong> Adviser 2: David Hollingworth </strong></p> <p>One possible solution for Diane is Northern Rock's Together scheme, which allows 95 per cent of property value to be borrowed on a secured basis with a further 30 per cent unsecured. </p> <p>This could work well in raising capital to cover not only the negative equity but possibly rolling in the debts. However, on a multiple of 3.5 times income, Diane would have a borrowing capacity of \u00a368,600, which does not reach the required level. It seems she will have to tough it out a while longer but should take heart from the rising market which will hopefully continue to negate the deficit. </p> <p>Measures that Diane must concentrate on now are reducing her debt, particularly her mortgage balance if cashflow allows - rising rents may give some surplus that she could use. </p> <p>As regards Diane's endowment, she must wait to see if it is on track. If it is not, she will have four options: increase her payments; save extra in an alternative investment vehicle, such as an Isa; put the shortfall amount of the mortgage onto a repayment basis; or surrender the endowment and put the whole mortgage on a repayment basis. </p> <p>She should bear in mind that if she surrenders, the value is likely to be significantly less than on maturity. But if Diane's main drive is to get rid of the property then there could be grounds for the surrender to reduce the mortgage and speed up progress towards parity with the market value.</p> <p> David Hollingworth works for London &amp; Country Mortgages </p> <p> Advice is for guidance only</p>",

The recent rise in property prices in the South-east has boosted the value of her apartment, but she believes it is still only worth around \u00a325,000. She would dearly love to get rid of it and buy a small house of her own, but that would cost around \u00a368,000 to \u00a370,000. Her endowment is another disappointment to her. She says the last notification showed it was worth just \u00a35,000, even though it has been running for nearly 10 years. She is waiting to hear whether it is on track to pay off her mortgage at the end of the term, but is pessimistic. Her main priority is to do something about the apartment. 'It has been a real millstone round my neck. It has pulled me off the housing ladder and I would really like to get back on it again.' Adviser 1: Ray Boulger Based on her desire to buy a house for \u00a368,000 to \u00a370,000, Diane's options are limited. It will be impossible to do this without getting outside help or selling her endowment policy. She will lose out if she surrenders her policy, but will just about be able to buy the type of property she desperately wants and get back on the housing ladder. Over the long term, the profit she is likely to make on the house may compensate her for selling her endowment policy. If Diane sells her studio for \u00a325,000, after allowing for costs she will have to find about \u00a312,000 to pay off the mortgage; \u00a35,000 of this could come from the endowment policy, leaving \u00a37,000 to find. She could finance this and refinance her other borrowings of \u00a36,000 with a 10-year personal loan for \u00a313,000. The cheapest lender offering a loan over 10 years at present is NatWest. Her \u00a31,000 savings would almost cover the stamp duty and legal costs, but she would need a 100 per cent mortgage. Northern Rock would lend her up to \u00a367,000 on its Together mortgage. In addition to a reasonable variable interest rate of 7.29 per cent, there are no arrangement fees, no mortgage indemnity guarantee premium, no redemption penalties and no compulsory insurances. Based on current interest rates, her mortgage and loan repayments would be just over half of her net income. She should go ahead only if she is confident she can afford these monthly payments. Ray Boulger works for independent mortgage adviser John Charcol Adviser 2: David Hollingworth One possible solution for Diane is Northern Rock's Together scheme, which allows 95 per cent of property value to be borrowed on a secured basis with a further 30 per cent unsecured. This could work well in raising capital to cover not only the negative equity but possibly rolling in the debts. However, on a multiple of 3.5 times income, Diane would have a borrowing capacity of \u00a368,600, which does not reach the required level. It seems she will have to tough it out a while longer but should take heart from the rising market which will hopefully continue to negate the deficit. Measures that Diane must concentrate on now are reducing her debt, particularly her mortgage balance if cashflow allows - rising rents may give some surplus that she could use. As regards Diane's endowment, she must wait to see if it is on track. If it is not, she will have four options: increase her payments; save extra in an alternative investment vehicle, such as an Isa; put the shortfall amount of the mortgage onto a repayment basis; or surrender the endowment and put the whole mortgage on a repayment basis. She should bear in mind that if she surrenders, the value is likely to be significantly less than on maturity. But if Diane's main drive is to get rid of the property then there could be grounds for the surrender to reduce the mortgage and speed up progress towards parity with the market value.

The logistics were daunting, even though the building was empty. 'It has taken an awful lot of planning to get this absolutely right,' says Crosby's managing director, David Walker. 'The scheme has spent 12 months on the drawing board.' Already 83 of the homes are sold, although the first will not be ready until August. Prices of the one-, two- and three-bedroom flats that remain range from \u00a3135,000 to \u00a3395,000. Cala Homes has added a floor to the five-storey Britannic building in Birmingham to provide seven penthouses. Four of them will have two storeys, offering 2,500 sq ft of living space and 1,000 sq ft of private roof terraces. Prices start at \u00a3600,000. In Manchester, two new floors have been added to 25 Church Street, boosting the number of flats in the old BT building to 78. The interiors were designed by Sir Terence Conran's company, CD Partnership, to appeal to the style-conscious. Prices range from \u00a360,000 to \u00a3350,000. But there is a warning from Andrew Waller, of estate agent Strutt &amp; Parker, for those thinking of becoming upwardly mobile. 'The worry is that a penthouse can be devalued if someone builds above it. Being on the top floor has kudos. And sometimes leaseholders think it's unfair for the freeholder to make a profit at their inconvenience. It pays to try to solve neighbour problems before you start.'

      "body": "<p>'Jokey is the wrong word.' Rolf Snoeren does not like my choice of adjective. He is not laughing. Nor is Viktor Horsting, the other half of Viktor &amp; Rolf, the Dutch design duo who are among the top five most influential fashion designers working today. Viktor's pointy little dog is not amused either: Vicky is just sitting on Viktor's lap, taking in the conversation. </p> <p>No, Viktor and Rolf are not the clowns of the fashion world, even though that is how many of the journalists who have watched their fashion shows over the past five seasons may perceive them. Just because they make clothes fit for Pierrot, with great ruffles at the neck and comedy humps at the shoulders, it does not follow that they are having a laugh. Even when they produced a limited-edition perfume - something to which more experienced designers can only aspire - only to advertise the fact that it did not smell of anything, they were not laughing. Not so much as a giggle or a smirk. I stand corrected. This is no joke. </p> <p>What is extraordinary about Viktor and Rolf is that eight years since leaving college, they are only just gearing up to put their first collection into production. Up until this autumn, Viktor and Rolf have concentrated on the highest and most expensive level of fashion: haute couture. Like artists, they have sold a piece here and a piece there. By their own admission, the majority of their output has been bought by museums, galleries and fashion institutes. These are clothes that are absolute one-offs and would take even the most adventurous follower of fashion several stiff drinks before she would venture out in them. And even then, she'd have to have a pretty good excuse. When one Sunday Times journalist took to the streets in a \u00a315,000 V&amp;R harlequin outfit - all in the name of research - she found herself to be the source of the evening's entertainment. These are not clothes designed to flatter, but they will certainly make passers-by stop and stare. 'I would rather spend the rest of my life looking like a dwarf,' she concluded. 'The effect of the outfit was to make me look like a pierrot after he had been trodden on by Godzilla.' Not the usual response you'd imagine from a woman slipping on a little haute couture for the first time in her life. </p> <p>But come September, the first Viktor &amp; Rolf ready-to-wear collection will sell out before it even hits the rails. 'We wanted to do something global,' says Rolf. So they have gone straight for the jugular. The designers, who have previously been all about exclusivity and obscure, arty experimentation, have produced a collection called Americana - an all-singing, all-dancing, cheerleading celebration of American sportswear. If Ronald McDonald him- self were to design a fashion collection, he couldn't have done a better job. The clothes are not subtle, making full use of the American flag, which is the collection's motif. </p> <p>'The collection is based on American sportswear. We wanted to use something that has a global image,' says Viktor. So they took that most clich\u00e9d of images, the Stars and Stripes, and printed it on sweatshirts and jeans. 'The collection is about globalisation, about how American culture is very present everywhere.' But this is not a protest. The designers are ambivalent about America's influence. 'That's just the way it is,' they shrug. 'American companies have the formula of how to go global. For us, it's about taking icons and using them.' </p> <p>But how is their use of the stars and stripes any different from the way Tommy Hilfiger or Ralph Lauren uses them? 'For us, it's a metaphor,' they say. 'For Tommy Hilfiger, that's really what he does. We are taking the clich\u00e9 and pushing it further.' Kate Betts, editor-in-chief of the US Harper's Bazaar , sums it up with just one word: 'Irony. They have a really unique, intelligent, humorous take on fashion,' she says. 'They love fashion, but they are not afraid to poke fun at it, which is very unusual in this world.' </p> <p>Americana was hailed a hit by the New York Times ' tough fashion critic, Cathy Horyn, who declared: 'The collection of natty jeans, ruffled shirts and sleek pantsuits that draw on their distinctive silhouette is terrific.' Betts agrees: 'It really proved that they can apply their wit and flair to wearable clothes. I think that the press reacted so positively because they were clothes that were inspired, but not abstract.' This month's issue of Bazaar devotes two spreads to the designers. 'Americans love Americana,' says Betts. </p> <p>And it is not just the press that is cheering. It has been snapped up by nine key stores in America as well as in Japan, and in London by Liberty and the underground Soho boutique, Pineal Eye - which is almost unheard of for a first collection. Yuko Yabiku, the owner of Pineal Eye, feels privileged to have had two pieces of Viktor &amp; Rolf already. They are from their first couture collect- ion in January 1998 - a jacket with gold spangles on the shoulder, and a white silk wedding dress. The pieces cost about \u00a34,000 each. They have not yet sold, having been on sale since the shop opened three years ago. 'You have to have the right person,' says Yabiku, optimistically. 'I don't mind that they haven't sold yet. They are very special pieces, and anyway, they won't age. They are couture items, but they have to find the right person to fit them.' They are more art objects than shop stock. But this has not put Pineal Eye off buying the ready-to- wear collection. </p> <p>'I thought they were so clever,' enthuses Yabiku. 'The clothes still have the feeling of couture in shape and design, but they are easier to wear. Instead of putting their logo on the clothes, they have used the American flag.' The stars and stripes have become their logo, and will be as instantly identifiable as a Louis Vuitton Damier print, which is exactly what the wearer will want. 'We've ordered most of it,' says Yabiku. 'From a simple jacket with striped shirt linings to the sweatshirt-fabric trousers.' Viktor and Rolf have gone from one extreme to the other. Not only is the collection wearable and washable, it is cheap. The most expensive piece is a coat, which will retail at \u00a3300. The jeans will be around the \u00a370 mark. </p> <p>This week, they take part in La Beaut\u00e9, a major art show in Avignon - part of the city's celebrations as cultural city of France 2000 alongside other artists, designers, musicians and architects, including Hussein Chalayan, Alexander McQueen, Bj\u00f6rk, Nick Knight, Jeff Koons, Arvo P\u00e4rt, Nan Goldin and Christian Boltanski. The show takes over the whole town, from 27 May to 1 October. Viktor and Rolf's installation centres around their collection of press cuttings and reviews, which they have made into a short video. They are fascinated by their own reviews, not least because at times they have felt that their fashion has not actually existed until it has appeared in print. Their career so far has been an exercise in how to generate publicity - a mixture of pranks, PR stunts, and clothes that not only push the boundaries of wearability, but at times appear to have been designed for creatures from another planet. </p> <p> It has not been easy being Viktor and Rolf. These two talented designers met in the fashion department of the Academy of Fine Arts in Arnhem - the Netherlands' answer to Saint Martin's School of Art - in 1988. They realised that they went together like frites and mayonnaise in 1993, when they jointly entered the prestigious annual young designer prize at Hy\u00e8res in the south of France. They didn't even have a name for their student experiments, and called themselves Viktor &amp; Rolf because, well, those were their names. 'When we participated together in the contest, it was meant to be for one time only,' says Rolf. Completely unexpectedly, they won the prize. From that point on, they have been a partnership, working seamlessly as a single entity, just like the fashion world's very own Gilbert and George. </p> <p>Viktor and Rolf's studio is situated up a quiet mews, between the queen's palace and Amsterdam's Red Light District. It is literally one small room, with their desk and lots of chaotic-looking filing cabinets at one end, and the pattern cutting table at the other. There is just about enough room to stand between the rails that line the walls - packed with great hulking clothes bags containing pieces of previous collections - and the table. And this is where the haute couture collections are conceived, designed and made, as well as the new ready-to-wear line. As a sign of their own intended small-scale globalisation, they are looking for a bigger place to work. </p> <p>Viktor appears at the door, a slim, lanky figure with long arms and a studious look about him helped, perhaps, by his wire-rimmed specs. He wears jeans, with a red, white and black Argyle sweater - the sort of thing you might imagine Ronnie Corbett to wear. Rolf is close behind. He seems a little more nervy, and reserved, with small, rectangular glasses, a stubbly moustache and a tiny dimple of a goatee under his bottom lip. He's dressed in a plain jumper and jeans. There is a saying in the Netherlands that roughly translates as: 'Just be normal. It's crazy enough.' And it sums up Viktor and Rolf. The creators of some of the most extreme clothes the Paris catwalk has ever known appear to be the most normal Joes you could ever meet. But then, you look around the streets of Amsterdam and realise that everybody looks average. The way people dress is very everyday, even at night. People do not get dressed up. They don't seem to make an effort at all. </p> <p>'Fashion does not exist in Holland,' says Viktor. 'There's a lot of money here but it's not done to show it. Holland is a very egalitarian society.' Showing off is not encouraged. Congratulations and compliments are rare. Everything is on a very even keel. Despite the fact that Viktor and Rolf are the kings of the international avant-garde fashion scene, f ted from Paris to New York, at home, they are barely noticed. And that is perhaps why they feel comfortable in Calvinist Amsterdam. They've lived in Paris, but found it too much of a struggle: 'We were so isolated, disconnected. It was very good for our creativity - we like to make life hard for ourselves.' Their parting shot to France was to take a trip to Disneyland Paris on their way home. The experience would have appealed to their sense of the surreal. Although they take their work seriously, it is with great relief that I realise they do have a sense of humour after all. And a wicked streak of irony. 'You have to put things in perspective,' they say, 'otherwise you take things too seriously.' </p> <p>They are both obsessed with fashion, and have been since they were teenagers. Rolf recalls spending his adolescence locked away in his bedroom in a suburb in the south of Holland, fantasising over magazine features on Thierry Mugler or Claude Montana. He was interested in little else, dreaming of launching himself into this other world that seemed only to exist in Paris, New York and glossy magazines. And, now, aged 30, he and Viktor, who turns 31 this month, are at the epicentre of that world. They say they aren't interested in politics (although they think the queen of Holland should be de-throned, and they left their prestigious teaching post at the Academy for Applied Art in Vienna when the rightwing government was elected so as not to be employed by it), go to see films and art shows just as anyone does (rather than, as many fashion designers do, to 'be inspired'), and while it was their interest in fashion that first brought them together, it seems to be one of the few things they have in common. What else is there? </p> <p>'We're not really into \"things\",' says Rolf. The only things they collect are press cuttings about their work, and a few treasured works by their friends, the avant-garde Dutch photographers Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin. They don't have a sense of nostalgia about anything - not even their own work. 'Once a collection has been showcased, we quite easily let it go,' they say. 'It is not important for us to keep it.' And anyway, the Groninger Museum in Groningen archives their work and buys pieces every season. In November, the museum will host a major retrospective of their work. </p> <p>In Amsterdam, living is easy. Rolf can walk to work, while Viktor lives in the south of the city, an easy bike ride away from the studio. They do not have to live in Paris to show their haute couture collections there twice a year, nor to sell their ready-to-wear. But they do not consider themselves particularly Dutch. 'For us, Holland is only a place to live. We are not really into the Amsterdam scene.' </p> <p>Strange though it may seem, the Netherlands is a hotbed of innovative new talent. Thanks to the efforts of Viktor and Rolf, to be Dutch in the fashion world right now is to be born with a passport straight into the hippest fashion magazines of London and Paris. The fact that one of those style bibles happens to be called Dutch , has of course, helped. But the Netherlands also has an exceptionally enlightened attitude when it comes to arts funding. The government offers an annual bonanza of grants to anyone who can prove that they have an innovative idea, or a fashion or design business that needs funding. The fact that Viktor &amp; Rolf has only just launched a selling collection after almost a decade in business is a case in point. </p> <p>It is not surprising that they have become pigeonholed as part of the art-as-fashion fraternity. Before they began showing collections during Paris Haute Couture week, they took part in exhibitions and staged their own pranks and happenings. In March 1996, instead of having a show, they declared they were on strike and produced a 'Viktor &amp; Rolf on strike' poster. Their work has appeared in fashion exhibitions around the world, including the Visions of the Body show at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Japan. They have also produced costumes for the Netherlands Scapino Ballet, and were recently commissioned to design the uniforms for the staff of the Central Museum in Utrecht. </p> <p>If their work is unorthodox, so too are their working methods. They cannot tell who has done what on a particular collection, and they work in total collaboration. Instead of sitting down and sketching, or nipping off on some exotic research trip, they seem to thrive working in a vacuum. 'We like trying to erase all references.' They simply talk to each other, and out of their conversation they piece together a collection. 'For us, the most creative thing is to create our own language,' they say. 'We talk, and try to figure out why certain things come up all the time, and then we ask why. We don't just wake up with a great idea.' And when one is in a bad mood, the other usually follows. 'We feed on each other's moods,' says Rolf. 'We don't have a lot of creative contact with other people.' </p> <p>Fame and fortune have not happened overnight for the twosome. After Hy\u00e8res, they worked away in relative obscurity, showing their clothes as part of a Netherlands collective, and exhibiting at arty shows around Europe. In 1998, however, they rocked the rarefied Paris couture world. John Galliano and Alexander McQueen had already given dying-on-its-feet haute couture an adrenalin injection. But V&amp;R's second show had the effect of electric-shock treatment. It was based on the atom bomb, and the clothes - a tuxedo suit, a grotesque clown outfit - were all in the shape of a mushroom cloud, bizarrely exaggerated around the neck and shoulders, padded with blown-up balloons and cuddly toys, and strewn with party streamers and pompoms. The models walked, sombrely, to a slowed-down soundtrack of Prince's '1999', a sinister premonition of a dark and terrible Millennium Eve. 'We were thinking of New Year's Eve '99 and Nostradamus,' says Viktor. 'Not that we believed in any of it. For us, the millennium was just a number.' Despite the clown outfits and the bright polka-dot prints, the decadent collection was spine-chillingly pessimistic. And, of course, the fashion pack loved it. 'We didn't see it was so extreme when we were working on it,' says Viktor. But extreme it was, both in subject matter and silhouette. </p> <p> Their next collection both infuriated and enchanted by showing their entire collection of black-and-white clothes virtually in the dark. UV light picked out the white trim and edging on the clothes, while the audience squinted to see the rest. For the finale, the lights went up, and each outfit was shown again, quite exquisite in finish and elegant in style. 'We had been working for six years and it hadn't been easy. And then, the atom bomb collection got so much attention, the black-and-white collection was literally, for us, coming out of the dark and stepping into the light.' For their most recent happening, they focused on just seven garments, and made the most of the fashion show as theatre by personally dressing their one model, Maggie Rizer, as a Russian doll. She began with a tiny slip and ended almost collapsing under the weight of a typically exaggerated Viktor &amp; Rolf coat. The piece, still in their studio, is so heavy I could barely lift it from the hanger. </p> <p>Until now, the fact that you would pass out if you attempted to carry the weight of a V&amp;R coat for an evening at the opera has not bothered the designers one jot. In a way, their haute couture extravaganzas have existed solely for the catwalk and the photographs of their friends Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin. Van Lamsweerde is a regular contributor to The Face and the US Harper's Bazaar, as well as working for designers including Yohji Yamamoto and the high-powered glossy advertising campaign for Louis Vuitton. She has championed Viktor &amp; Rolf from the start, featuring their work in such publications as the cult American art-and-fashion quarterly, Visionaire. V&amp;R's bold, voluminous shapes are just perfect for her sharp, graphic photography. </p> <p>A Viktor &amp; Rolf image by van Lamsweerde and Matadin was chosen for the cover of Visionaire 2000 , an A-Z of the most influential fashion designers for the 21st century. 'Fashion doesn't have to be something people wear,' they are quoted as saying. 'Fashion is also an image.' For most designers, the image follows the clothes. But for Viktor &amp; Rolf, it is the other way around. As a marketing strategy, it could not have been planned better. But the designers insist there is no strategy. 'There was no plan,' they say. 'We knew from the start we wanted to have ready-to-wear and our own shops.' </p> <p>But despite their fame and experience, Viktor and Rolf are only just beginning. 'Fashion is a very powerful medium,' they say. And they intend to use that power. 'Compared to our other collections, Americana has a more optimistic feeling, that things are happening in a business sense. It is important that we are a commercial success. We want to be powerful in our own way. It goes further than ready-to-wear. We want to do menswear, a shoe collection, perfume...' And this time, the scent will be more than simply water and clever packaging - what else could it be but the sweet smell of success?</p>",

But come September, the first Viktor &amp; Rolf ready-to-wear collection will sell out before it even hits the rails. 'We wanted to do something global,' says Rolf. So they have gone straight for the jugular. The designers, who have previously been all about exclusivity and obscure, arty experimentation, have produced a collection called Americana - an all-singing, all-dancing, cheerleading celebration of American sportswear. If Ronald McDonald him- self were to design a fashion collection, he couldn't have done a better job. The clothes are not subtle, making full use of the American flag, which is the collection's motif. 'The collection is based on American sportswear. We wanted to use something that has a global image,' says Viktor. So they took that most clich\u00e9d of images, the Stars and Stripes, and printed it on sweatshirts and jeans. 'The collection is about globalisation, about how American culture is very present everywhere.' But this is not a protest. The designers are ambivalent about America's influence. 'That's just the way it is,' they shrug. 'American companies have the formula of how to go global. For us, it's about taking icons and using them.' But how is their use of the stars and stripes any different from the way Tommy Hilfiger or Ralph Lauren uses them? 'For us, it's a metaphor,' they say. 'For Tommy Hilfiger, that's really what he does. We are taking the clich\u00e9 and pushing it further.' Kate Betts, editor-in-chief of the US Harper's Bazaar , sums it up with just one word: 'Irony. They have a really unique, intelligent, humorous take on fashion,' she says. 'They love fashion, but they are not afraid to poke fun at it, which is very unusual in this world.' Americana was hailed a hit by the New York Times ' tough fashion critic, Cathy Horyn, who declared: 'The collection of natty jeans, ruffled shirts and sleek pantsuits that draw on their distinctive silhouette is terrific.' Betts agrees: 'It really proved that they can apply their wit and flair to wearable clothes. I think that the press reacted so positively because they were clothes that were inspired, but not abstract.' This month's issue of Bazaar devotes two spreads to the designers. 'Americans love Americana,' says Betts. And it is not just the press that is cheering. It has been snapped up by nine key stores in America as well as in Japan, and in London by Liberty and the underground Soho boutique, Pineal Eye - which is almost unheard of for a first collection. Yuko Yabiku, the owner of Pineal Eye, feels privileged to have had two pieces of Viktor &amp; Rolf already. They are from their first couture collect- ion in January 1998 - a jacket with gold spangles on the shoulder, and a white silk wedding dress. The pieces cost about \u00a34,000 each. They have not yet sold, having been on sale since the shop opened three years ago. 'You have to have the right person,' says Yabiku, optimistically. 'I don't mind that they haven't sold yet. They are very special pieces, and anyway, they won't age. They are couture items, but they have to find the right person to fit them.' They are more art objects than shop stock. But this has not put Pineal Eye off buying the ready-to- wear collection. 'I thought they were so clever,' enthuses Yabiku. 'The clothes still have the feeling of couture in shape and design, but they are easier to wear. Instead of putting their logo on the clothes, they have used the American flag.' The stars and stripes have become their logo, and will be as instantly identifiable as a Louis Vuitton Damier print, which is exactly what the wearer will want. 'We've ordered most of it,' says Yabiku. 'From a simple jacket with striped shirt linings to the sweatshirt-fabric trousers.' Viktor and Rolf have gone from one extreme to the other. Not only is the collection wearable and washable, it is cheap. The most expensive piece is a coat, which will retail at \u00a3300. The jeans will be around the \u00a370 mark. This week, they take part in La Beaut\u00e9, a major art show in Avignon - part of the city's celebrations as cultural city of France 2000 alongside other artists, designers, musicians and architects, including Hussein Chalayan, Alexander McQueen, Bj\u00f6rk, Nick Knight, Jeff Koons, Arvo P\u00e4rt, Nan Goldin and Christian Boltanski. The show takes over the whole town, from 27 May to 1 October. Viktor and Rolf's installation centres around their collection of press cuttings and reviews, which they have made into a short video. They are fascinated by their own reviews, not least because at times they have felt that their fashion has not actually existed until it has appeared in print. Their career so far has been an exercise in how to generate publicity - a mixture of pranks, PR stunts, and clothes that not only push the boundaries of wearability, but at times appear to have been designed for creatures from another planet. It has not been easy being Viktor and Rolf. These two talented designers met in the fashion department of the Academy of Fine Arts in Arnhem - the Netherlands' answer to Saint Martin's School of Art - in 1988. They realised that they went together like frites and mayonnaise in 1993, when they jointly entered the prestigious annual young designer prize at Hy\u00e8res in the south of France. They didn't even have a name for their student experiments, and called themselves Viktor &amp; Rolf because, well, those were their names. 'When we participated together in the contest, it was meant to be for one time only,' says Rolf. Completely unexpectedly, they won the prize. From that point on, they have been a partnership, working seamlessly as a single entity, just like the fashion world's very own Gilbert and George. Viktor and Rolf's studio is situated up a quiet mews, between the queen's palace and Amsterdam's Red Light District. It is literally one small room, with their desk and lots of chaotic-looking filing cabinets at one end, and the pattern cutting table at the other. There is just about enough room to stand between the rails that line the walls - packed with great hulking clothes bags containing pieces of previous collections - and the table. And this is where the haute couture collections are conceived, designed and made, as well as the new ready-to-wear line. As a sign of their own intended small-scale globalisation, they are looking for a bigger place to work. Viktor appears at the door, a slim, lanky figure with long arms and a studious look about him helped, perhaps, by his wire-rimmed specs. He wears jeans, with a red, white and black Argyle sweater - the sort of thing you might imagine Ronnie Corbett to wear. Rolf is close behind. He seems a little more nervy, and reserved, with small, rectangular glasses, a stubbly moustache and a tiny dimple of a goatee under his bottom lip. He's dressed in a plain jumper and jeans. There is a saying in the Netherlands that roughly translates as: 'Just be normal. It's crazy enough.' And it sums up Viktor and Rolf. The creators of some of the most extreme clothes the Paris catwalk has ever known appear to be the most normal Joes you could ever meet. But then, you look around the streets of Amsterdam and realise that everybody looks average. The way people dress is very everyday, even at night. People do not get dressed up. They don't seem to make an effort at all. 'Fashion does not exist in Holland,' says Viktor. 'There's a lot of money here but it's not done to show it. Holland is a very egalitarian society.' Showing off is not encouraged. Congratulations and compliments are rare. Everything is on a very even keel. Despite the fact that Viktor and Rolf are the kings of the international avant-garde fashion scene, f ted from Paris to New York, at home, they are barely noticed. And that is perhaps why they feel comfortable in Calvinist Amsterdam. They've lived in Paris, but found it too much of a struggle: 'We were so isolated, disconnected. It was very good for our creativity - we like to make life hard for ourselves.' Their parting shot to France was to take a trip to Disneyland Paris on their way home. The experience would have appealed to their sense of the surreal. Although they take their work seriously, it is with great relief that I realise they do have a sense of humour after all. And a wicked streak of irony. 'You have to put things in perspective,' they say, 'otherwise you take things too seriously.' They are both obsessed with fashion, and have been since they were teenagers. Rolf recalls spending his adolescence locked away in his bedroom in a suburb in the south of Holland, fantasising over magazine features on Thierry Mugler or Claude Montana. He was interested in little else, dreaming of launching himself into this other world that seemed only to exist in Paris, New York and glossy magazines. And, now, aged 30, he and Viktor, who turns 31 this month, are at the epicentre of that world. They say they aren't interested in politics (although they think the queen of Holland should be de-throned, and they left their prestigious teaching post at the Academy for Applied Art in Vienna when the rightwing government was elected so as not to be employed by it), go to see films and art shows just as anyone does (rather than, as many fashion designers do, to 'be inspired'), and while it was their interest in fashion that first brought them together, it seems to be one of the few things they have in common. What else is there? 'We're not really into \"things\",' says Rolf. The only things they collect are press cuttings about their work, and a few treasured works by their friends, the avant-garde Dutch photographers Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin. They don't have a sense of nostalgia about anything - not even their own work. 'Once a collection has been showcased, we quite easily let it go,' they say. 'It is not important for us to keep it.' And anyway, the Groninger Museum in Groningen archives their work and buys pieces every season. In November, the museum will host a major retrospective of their work. In Amsterdam, living is easy. Rolf can walk to work, while Viktor lives in the south of the city, an easy bike ride away from the studio. They do not have to live in Paris to show their haute couture collections there twice a year, nor to sell their ready-to-wear. But they do not consider themselves particularly Dutch. 'For us, Holland is only a place to live. We are not really into the Amsterdam scene.' Strange though it may seem, the Netherlands is a hotbed of innovative new talent. Thanks to the efforts of Viktor and Rolf, to be Dutch in the fashion world right now is to be born with a passport straight into the hippest fashion magazines of London and Paris. The fact that one of those style bibles happens to be called Dutch , has of course, helped. But the Netherlands also has an exceptionally enlightened attitude when it comes to arts funding. The government offers an annual bonanza of grants to anyone who can prove that they have an innovative idea, or a fashion or design business that needs funding. The fact that Viktor &amp; Rolf has only just launched a selling collection after almost a decade in business is a case in point. It is not surprising that they have become pigeonholed as part of the art-as-fashion fraternity. Before they began showing collections during Paris Haute Couture week, they took part in exhibitions and staged their own pranks and happenings. In March 1996, instead of having a show, they declared they were on strike and produced a 'Viktor &amp; Rolf on strike' poster. Their work has appeared in fashion exhibitions around the world, including the Visions of the Body show at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Japan. They have also produced costumes for the Netherlands Scapino Ballet, and were recently commissioned to design the uniforms for the staff of the Central Museum in Utrecht. If their work is unorthodox, so too are their working methods. They cannot tell who has done what on a particular collection, and they work in total collaboration. Instead of sitting down and sketching, or nipping off on some exotic research trip, they seem to thrive working in a vacuum. 'We like trying to erase all references.' They simply talk to each other, and out of their conversation they piece together a collection. 'For us, the most creative thing is to create our own language,' they say. 'We talk, and try to figure out why certain things come up all the time, and then we ask why. We don't just wake up with a great idea.' And when one is in a bad mood, the other usually follows. 'We feed on each other's moods,' says Rolf. 'We don't have a lot of creative contact with other people.' Fame and fortune have not happened overnight for the twosome. After Hy\u00e8res, they worked away in relative obscurity, showing their clothes as part of a Netherlands collective, and exhibiting at arty shows around Europe. In 1998, however, they rocked the rarefied Paris couture world. John Galliano and Alexander McQueen had already given dying-on-its-feet haute couture an adrenalin injection. But V&amp;R's second show had the effect of electric-shock treatment. It was based on the atom bomb, and the clothes - a tuxedo suit, a grotesque clown outfit - were all in the shape of a mushroom cloud, bizarrely exaggerated around the neck and shoulders, padded with blown-up balloons and cuddly toys, and strewn with party streamers and pompoms. The models walked, sombrely, to a slowed-down soundtrack of Prince's '1999', a sinister premonition of a dark and terrible Millennium Eve. 'We were thinking of New Year's Eve '99 and Nostradamus,' says Viktor. 'Not that we believed in any of it. For us, the millennium was just a number.' Despite the clown outfits and the bright polka-dot prints, the decadent collection was spine-chillingly pessimistic. And, of course, the fashion pack loved it. 'We didn't see it was so extreme when we were working on it,' says Viktor. But extreme it was, both in subject matter and silhouette. Their next collection both infuriated and enchanted by showing their entire collection of black-and-white clothes virtually in the dark. UV light picked out the white trim and edging on the clothes, while the audience squinted to see the rest. For the finale, the lights went up, and each outfit was shown again, quite exquisite in finish and elegant in style. 'We had been working for six years and it hadn't been easy. And then, the atom bomb collection got so much attention, the black-and-white collection was literally, for us, coming out of the dark and stepping into the light.' For their most recent happening, they focused on just seven garments, and made the most of the fashion show as theatre by personally dressing their one model, Maggie Rizer, as a Russian doll. She began with a tiny slip and ended almost collapsing under the weight of a typically exaggerated Viktor &amp; Rolf coat. The piece, still in their studio, is so heavy I could barely lift it from the hanger. Until now, the fact that you would pass out if you attempted to carry the weight of a V&amp;R coat for an evening at the opera has not bothered the designers one jot. In a way, their haute couture extravaganzas have existed solely for the catwalk and the photographs of their friends Inez van Lamsweerde and Vinoodh Matadin. Van Lamsweerde is a regular contributor to The Face and the US Harper's Bazaar, as well as working for designers including Yohji Yamamoto and the high-powered glossy advertising campaign for Louis Vuitton. She has championed Viktor &amp; Rolf from the start, featuring their work in such publications as the cult American art-and-fashion quarterly, Visionaire. V&amp;R's bold, voluminous shapes are just perfect for her sharp, graphic photography. A Viktor &amp; Rolf image by van Lamsweerde and Matadin was chosen for the cover of Visionaire 2000 , an A-Z of the most influential fashion designers for the 21st century. 'Fashion doesn't have to be something people wear,' they are quoted as saying. 'Fashion is also an image.' For most designers, the image follows the clothes. But for Viktor &amp; Rolf, it is the other way around. As a marketing strategy, it could not have been planned better. But the designers insist there is no strategy. 'There was no plan,' they say. 'We knew from the start we wanted to have ready-to-wear and our own shops.' But despite their fame and experience, Viktor and Rolf are only just beginning. 'Fashion is a very powerful medium,' they say. And they intend to use that power. 'Compared to our other collections, Americana has a more optimistic feeling, that things are happening in a business sense. It is important that we are a commercial success. We want to be powerful in our own way. It goes further than ready-to-wear. We want to do menswear, a shoe collection, perfume...' And this time, the scent will be more than simply water and clever packaging - what else could it be but the sweet smell of success?",

      "body": "<p>One thing you can definitely say about Damien Hirst the artist is that he's got balls. I know this because I am looking at them. They are unusually round and swollen-seeming and present themselves with a tomato-like impudence. A small indentation runs along each side, from front to back, as though two testicles are fighting to occupy the space normally claimed by one. You wouldn't say they were beautiful to behold - or even anything other than mildly unpleasant - but might describe them as thought-provoking. The renowned art critic Clement Greenberg once noted that all great art looks ugly at first, and the same, I suppose, is true of bollocks.</p> <p>Right now, the Hirst bits are suspended about two and a half feet above a hill in Devon, lording it over one of the most green and pleasant tracts of land you are ever likely to encounter. Most of what is seen from here belongs to them, for this is the Hirst farm, home to the Hirst family and a dozen or so builders who are forever rearranging it like paint on a canvas, not to mention a collection of understandably twitchy- looking animals.</p> <p>All morning, I've been chuckling at visions of sheep in market pens dolefully rolling their eyes heavenward upon being told who their new owner is, and am sure I hear the livestock muttering cautionary imprecations to each other every time we pass. I've been telling myself that they're just not accustomed to seeing grown men traipsing across fields in women's knickers, tights and St George's cross jumpers, but can't help noticing that the woman cab driver who arrives to take five-year-old Connor Hirst to a birthday party doesn't bat an eyelid. In the village, they refer to the squire merely as 'Damien'. The conclusion has to be that they're used to such sights in these parts.</p> <p>Hirst is only nominally here in his capacity as the third most expensive living British artist (after Lucian Freud and David Hockney, both of whom have seen approximately twice his 34 years). Rather, he is engaged in a promotional photo session for Fat Les, the prank art collective who blew the English Football Association's vapid official World Cup anthem clear out of the water in 1998, with a brash romp called 'Vindaloo'.</p> <p>Now, it's not often that a group of indiv- iduals are accused of lowering the tone of terrace chants, but on that occasion Hirst and his partners - the hell-raising actor Keith Allen and Blur's urbane bassist, Alex James - were. The words to that song went: 'Vindaloo, vindaloo, vin-da-loo, vin-da-loo na-na/Vin-da-loo, vin-da-loo-oo: we're gonna score one more... than... you...' and, once heard, could be expunged from the mind only by means of a frontal lobotomy. The record made number two in the UK singles chart and was one of that year's 10 bestsellers, but was regarded in chattering circles as an irritating, pretentiously proletarian jape on the part of three millionaire artists who should have known better.</p> <p>This opinion was held, not least, by the leader of James's own band, Damon Albarn, who reportedly considered the Blur man's participation undignified and demeaning. As with so much else in Fat Les's world, however, all was not quite as it seemed.</p> <p>As a piece of art, 'Vindaloo' was deceptively brilliant. It might have sounded like a yobbish din and been less musical than William Hague singing in the shower, but that summer Allen, James and Hirst persuaded, among others, a lot of xenophobic, racist Little England football supporters to celebrate an item of Indian cuisine as a quintessential expression of Englishness. As Allen had it at the time, 'Getting a load of reactionary fuckers to sing \"Vin-da-loo\" was actually quite hilarious.' And he was right. Fat Les's accusers saw 'Vindaloo' as the hateful spawn of postmodern relativism (Hirst, capable of world-class visual art, chooses to waste his time on a guileless football song, implying the two to be of equal value, etcetera...), but the truth was that they had stood those tired p-m orthodoxies on their head. This was never postmodern. Here we had the world's first post-moronists, with a piece of work that pretended to stupidity, while being rich with maning. It was Fat Les 1, Reactionary fuckers 0.</p> <p>No one can pull this kind of thing off more than once, though. Can they? I'm here to find out. The trio have sprung back to life in time for next month's Euro 2000 tournament, this time with an ambitious version of one of the most stirring songs ever written, Hubert Parry's setting of the Blake poem, Jerusalem . The FA, having had their fingers badly burned last time, have swallowed pride and better judgment by playing ball with Fat Les this time. 'Jerusalem' will be the official camp anthem. Which is why Damien Hirst is standing in a pasture with his tights round his knees and a daisy jammed into his foreskin. That rumbling you hear in the distance is Bobby Moore turning in his grave.</p> <p>'Jerusalem' is lent an added poignancy by the fact that it catches the members of Fat Les at a strange juncture in their individual careers. In September, Hirst will present his first solo show in four years, following a fallow period during which he seemed more interested in living high and making money than art. In some circles, he has already been written off as a pre-millennial curiosity and chancer, though this is a shamefully myopic view.</p> <p>James, too, is at a crossroads. He was going to fly his own two-seater Grummer plane down to Devon, but thunderstorms in the night mean that we find ourselves together on a train this bright Sunday morning. Invariably summed up as 'personable', James is bright and articulate and I am tempted to describe him as more 'normal' than his two partners - certainly, he is more reserved, but as you'll have gathered, that's not saying much.</p> <p>He befriended Hirst and Allen in the bar of the Groucho Club in London, although he first met the artist when they were both studying at Goldsmiths College and speaks of them as of wise older brothers, who helped him through the craziness of the Britpop years, which his band's seminal Parklife album kick-started.</p> <p>'I can't imagine how my life would have turned out if I hadn't met them,' he says. 'They've been a big influence on the way I think. They're go-getters. They see through all the shit. The best bands are where there's a kind of allegiance. It has to be a gang. That's how it always was with Blur and how it is with Damien and Keith.'</p> <p>Blur is 'giving each other some space' at the moment. Singer Albarn and guitarist Graeme Coxon (another Goldsmiths alumnus) have recently become fathers, and James is clearly apprehensive about what this means for the future. He has given up alcohol for six months and thrown himself into the making of 'Jerusalem' with vigour. 'I think it's partly to do with the discipline that learning to fly has given me,' he says. 'I thought, \"I've got six months off - I wonder what I can do? Let's try and achieve something.\"' So he made one of the most expensive singles in the history of the British pop industry.</p> <p>The budget for 'Jerusalem' was a staggering \u00a350,000, which was used to plonk a full orchestra and four choirs in the vast main studio at George Martin's Air complex in north London. He describes the session as an emotional experience ('I cried, I really did cry'), not to mention a little nerve-racking. As the clock ticked away and they hadn't finished, he was aware that an hour's overtime would add a catastrophic extra \u00a315,000 to the cost of the single. In the end, they just crept under the wire.</p> <p>Most of the subsequent haggling with the FA has concerned Allen's video and in particular scenes of him flying a Spitfire at the beginning and end. An offer to paint it pink and daub it with anti-violence graffiti didn't persuade them and the Spitfire is now out. Nonetheless, James is proud of his efforts and dreams of sparking a serious campaign to have it accepted as the new English national anthem.</p> <p>'It was worth the time and expense. It needs to be majesterial. Sporting events are one of the few times when the English feel a sense of national identity, which is a shame in a way. This was worth doing properly.'</p> <p>We get off the train at Tiverton and catch a cab to Hirst's place, which is about an hour away, near the coastal village of Combe Martin. If you ask Hirst what exactly he does in Fat Les, he'll smile raffishly and reply, 'I haven't a fucking clue.' If you ask James, he'll tell you that Hirst 'paints the taxi'. This is a reference to the black cab that Allen bought on a whim one day. He parked it outside the Groucho Club, but was seldom sober enough to drive it anywhere when he left. Fortunately, the tramp who camped outside, who is still known as 'Outside Dave', turned out to have a driving licence and Allen promptly hired him as his part-time chauffeur. Eventually, he suggested that Dave take to living in the vehicle, in return for transport home when necessary. The residents of Combe Martin have lots of similar stories to tell, about finding Allen and Hirst sitting atop chimneys hatching plans, or Allen leading gaggles of teenage girls up to the house to gaze at 'Alex from Blur' drooling into his pillow, asleep.</p> <p>Damien Hirst is still in bed, but we find Allen strolling on the beach with several other people, including Maia Hirst, the artist's Californian partner of 10 years or so, and their improbably angelic eight-day-old baby, Cassius. Allen, at a spry 46, is a good deal older than the others, and began as a confrontational stand-up comedian on the 'alternative comedy' circuit of the early 80s. He's mellowed over the years as his acting career has burgeoned, but is still capable of frightening outbursts when he feels the situation requires it. His laddish image, he contends, is undeserved. The old anger was a defence mechanism in response to a remote and aggressive father, and he doesn't need it any more, even if it probably helps him relate to Hirst.</p> <p>Watching the two egg each other on makes for an unsettling, though frequently entertaining, spectacle. There is nothing, you feel, that they couldn't persuade each other to do, and whether this stems from an absence of fear or an excess of it, I can't tell. Somehow, Hirst's bravado is less convincing, more forced.</p> <p>The Hirst estate covers one side of a chocolate box valley and is unspeakably lovely. A stone farmhouse with spare, modern interior stands amid picturesque gardens and Hansel and Gretel woods and grassy hills. The ground floor contains a smart open-plan kitchen and sitting area, scattered with art debris and a large tank in which fish swim among a selection of rubbish, including false teeth, a model shark and an old beer bottle. Ask friends and acquaintances to describe their owner and the phrase you will hear again and again is 'the cleverest person I know.' Often this will be quickly followed by 'and the rudest'. Charged with finding words to describe his colleague, the first thing Allen comes up with is 'Tourette's-like', a reference to the medical condition where sufferers lose all social inhibition, becoming progressively more foul-mouthed and intemperate.</p> <p>None of the above will quite prepare you for the reality of meeting Damien Hirst, though. Short, with a gruff Yorkshire accent and head that looks as though it was intended for someone a foot taller, the people he most immediately puts me in mind of are Robin Williams, Bill Hicks and John Cooper Clarke. In conversation, you feel like the taxi driver who's been ordered to follow a car which is already disappearing round a bend. Some of the exchanges between Allen and him during the photo shoot, little improvised skits about Bloko Ono and One Rasta and His Dog, provoke tears of laughter. Afterwards, Allen guffaws, 'You realise that this is going to slaughter Damon. He hates this stuff! It could be the end of Blur!' and James looks somewhat perturbed.</p> <p>Unlike Allen, who is easy to be around, there is a sharp edge, perhaps even a cruelty, to Hirst's wit. He seems to have an instinctive feel for people's weaknesses and you can watch him home in directly on these. He doesn't do small talk and warmth doesn't come easily, though he is reputedly a loyal and generous friend. I know of at least one person who will attest that he is also handy with his fists. Sitting down to talk one-to-one, without an audience, is fascinating, if peculiar. You're never sure what level of irony he is operating on and have to be on your toes at all times. A snatched, heavily censored exchange goes something like this:</p> <p>'You recently admitted that you \"got sick of being Damien Hirst\" after winning the Turner Prize. Is that what your reinvention as a tycoon was about?'</p> <p>'I don't know. What's a tycoon? I still am one. As I've said, art's a business. And if it's as important as they say it is, then I think money can't affect it. You have to separate the desire to make art from the desire to be famous. I'm into both and I think they're both about the same thing, which is that you want to live for ever.'</p> <p>'Has the arrival of Cassius affected your attitude to work?'</p> <p>'Yeah, he's a week and one day old and I've already learnt more from him than I could ever possibly teach him. Not bad in a week, though, is it? Bet your dad never told you that. I'm not going to tell him, either - haha.'</p> <p>'What's he taught you?'</p> <p>'How trivial and irrelevant it all is. And how small you are. That this world's for real. That if you're bored, you're off your knackers, you know what I mean? Buy a microscope if you're bored. It's just amazing. You look in his eyes and go, \"He's brand new!\" You forget that you were and things can be. He's got no idea who Damien Hirst is or what Fat Les is, or what art is_ I think our denial of death is what our lives are about, but I don't think that's negative. I mean, I'll tell you what. I don't believe in God, or I didn't believe in God_ I don't believe in God, but I find it very difficult to not believe in God and still believe in art at the moment. I don't know where it's going to go.'</p> <p>'What are you going to do about that?'</p> <p>'I don't know yet. I can live with the conflicts. But I'm definitely not going to sweep it under the carpet.

Lost Love and Love Lost , two room-sized fish tanks containing complete gynaecologists' offices, one with hundreds of bright tropical fish, the other with British course fish, are mentioned as favourites.

Four days after Devon, we've arranged to meet for a game of golf at a nine-hole course in Hampstead. Allen, still a keen and fit footballer, took the game up a couple of years ago and is besotted with it. In the event, he's an hour late, having returned from a session at the Groucho a few hours before, and it's raining hard. We repair to a driving range in King's Cross, belt some balls and chat.

When Alex pitched it to the FA, they said, \"Right, but where's the gag?\" People still say that to me when they hear it. They listen expecting something funny to happen and then it doesn't.

We can only evolve.'</p> <p>'Yeah, that's right. So we get left behind, with no sure sense of our own identity. Years ago, I remember going to a party after a football match, where there were lots of Scots and Welsh and everyone got up to do a national turn. When it came to ours, no one could think what to do. Someone started singing \"Pack up your troubles in your old kit bag!\" I thought, come on, you're 24, why don't you sing \"Anarchy in the UK\" or \"Satisfaction\" or something. I think this song, \"Jerusalem\", could really help to crystalise some kind of English culture. I believe that. I do. And how wonderful it is to have Trevor McDonald saying the name Fat Les - \"the popular music ensemble Fat Les\" - on TV. Twice!'</p> <p>Allen goes on to talk about reclaiming this song, with words penned by one of the more radical thinkers of his time, from the Right.

How fanciful are Allen and James's hopes for the song? Well, the day we meet for golf, The Sun is running an article headlined 'YOU HAVE 31 DAYS TO LEARN THESE WORDS FOR EURO 2000'. Then, there they are, the words to one of the loveliest poems in the English language. Within a few days, there is expected to be another piece entitled '10 THINGS YOU DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT WILLIAM BLAKE.' An amazing world indeed.</p>",

      "bodyText": "One thing you can definitely say about Damien Hirst the artist is that he's got balls. I know this because I am looking at them. They are unusually round and swollen-seeming and present themselves with a tomato-like impudence. A small indentation runs along each side, from front to back, as though two testicles are fighting to occupy the space normally claimed by one. You wouldn't say they were beautiful to behold - or even anything other than mildly unpleasant - but might describe them as thought-provoking. The renowned art critic Clement Greenberg once noted that all great art looks ugly at first, and the same, I suppose, is true of bollocks. Right now, the Hirst bits are suspended about two and a half feet above a hill in Devon, lording it over one of the most green and pleasant tracts of land you are ever likely to encounter. Most of what is seen from here belongs to them, for this is the Hirst farm, home to the Hirst family and a dozen or so builders who are forever rearranging it like paint on a canvas, not to mention a collection of understandably twitchy- looking animals. All morning, I've been chuckling at visions of sheep in market pens dolefully rolling their eyes heavenward upon being told who their new owner is, and am sure I hear the livestock muttering cautionary imprecations to each other every time we pass. I've been telling myself that they're just not accustomed to seeing grown men traipsing across fields in women's knickers, tights and St George's cross jumpers, but can't help noticing that the woman cab driver who arrives to take five-year-old Connor Hirst to a birthday party doesn't bat an eyelid. In the village, they refer to the squire merely as 'Damien'. The conclusion has to be that they're used to such sights in these parts. Hirst is only nominally here in his capacity as the third most expensive living British artist (after Lucian Freud and David Hockney, both of whom have seen approximately twice his 34 years). Rather, he is engaged in a promotional photo session for Fat Les, the prank art collective who blew the English Football Association's vapid official World Cup anthem clear out of the water in 1998, with a brash romp called 'Vindaloo'. Now, it's not often that a group of indiv- iduals are accused of lowering the tone of terrace chants, but on that occasion Hirst and his partners - the hell-raising actor Keith Allen and Blur's urbane bassist, Alex James - were. The words to that song went: 'Vindaloo, vindaloo, vin-da-loo, vin-da-loo na-na/Vin-da-loo, vin-da-loo-oo: we're gonna score one more... than... you...' and, once heard, could be expunged from the mind only by means of a frontal lobotomy. The record made number two in the UK singles chart and was one of that year's 10 bestsellers, but was regarded in chattering circles as an irritating, pretentiously proletarian jape on the part of three millionaire artists who should have known better. This opinion was held, not least, by the leader of James's own band, Damon Albarn, who reportedly considered the Blur man's participation undignified and demeaning. As with so much else in Fat Les's world, however, all was not quite as it seemed. As a piece of art, 'Vindaloo' was deceptively brilliant. It might have sounded like a yobbish din and been less musical than William Hague singing in the shower, but that summer Allen, James and Hirst persuaded, among others, a lot of xenophobic, racist Little England football supporters to celebrate an item of Indian cuisine as a quintessential expression of Englishness. As Allen had it at the time, 'Getting a load of reactionary fuckers to sing \"Vin-da-loo\" was actually quite hilarious.' And he was right. Fat Les's accusers saw 'Vindaloo' as the hateful spawn of postmodern relativism (Hirst, capable of world-class visual art, chooses to waste his time on a guileless football song, implying the two to be of equal value, etcetera...), but the truth was that they had stood those tired p-m orthodoxies on their head. This was never postmodern. Here we had the world's first post-moronists, with a piece of work that pretended to stupidity, while being rich with maning. It was Fat Les 1, Reactionary fuckers 0. No one can pull this kind of thing off more than once, though. Can they? I'm here to find out. The trio have sprung back to life in time for next month's Euro 2000 tournament, this time with an ambitious version of one of the most stirring songs ever written, Hubert Parry's setting of the Blake poem, Jerusalem . The FA, having had their fingers badly burned last time, have swallowed pride and better judgment by playing ball with Fat Les this time. 'Jerusalem' will be the official camp anthem. Which is why Damien Hirst is standing in a pasture with his tights round his knees and a daisy jammed into his foreskin. That rumbling you hear in the distance is Bobby Moore turning in his grave. 'Jerusalem' is lent an added poignancy by the fact that it catches the members of Fat Les at a strange juncture in their individual careers. In September, Hirst will present his first solo show in four years, following a fallow period during which he seemed more interested in living high and making money than art. In some circles, he has already been written off as a pre-millennial curiosity and chancer, though this is a shamefully myopic view. James, too, is at a crossroads. He was going to fly his own two-seater Grummer plane down to Devon, but thunderstorms in the night mean that we find ourselves together on a train this bright Sunday morning. Invariably summed up as 'personable', James is bright and articulate and I am tempted to describe him as more 'normal' than his two partners - certainly, he is more reserved, but as you'll have gathered, that's not saying much. He befriended Hirst and Allen in the bar of the Groucho Club in London, although he first met the artist when they were both studying at Goldsmiths College and speaks of them as of wise older brothers, who helped him through the craziness of the Britpop years, which his band's seminal Parklife album kick-started. 'I can't imagine how my life would have turned out if I hadn't met them,' he says. 'They've been a big influence on the way I think. They're go-getters. They see through all the shit. The best bands are where there's a kind of allegiance. It has to be a gang. That's how it always was with Blur and how it is with Damien and Keith.' Blur is 'giving each other some space' at the moment. Singer Albarn and guitarist Graeme Coxon (another Goldsmiths alumnus) have recently become fathers, and James is clearly apprehensive about what this means for the future. He has given up alcohol for six months and thrown himself into the making of 'Jerusalem' with vigour. 'I think it's partly to do with the discipline that learning to fly has given me,' he says. 'I thought, \"I've got six months off - I wonder what I can do? Let's try and achieve something.\"' So he made one of the most expensive singles in the history of the British pop industry. The budget for 'Jerusalem' was a staggering \u00a350,000, which was used to plonk a full orchestra and four choirs in the vast main studio at George Martin's Air complex in north London. He describes the session as an emotional experience ('I cried, I really did cry'), not to mention a little nerve-racking. As the clock ticked away and they hadn't finished, he was aware that an hour's overtime would add a catastrophic extra \u00a315,000 to the cost of the single. In the end, they just crept under the wire. Most of the subsequent haggling with the FA has concerned Allen's video and in particular scenes of him flying a Spitfire at the beginning and end. An offer to paint it pink and daub it with anti-violence graffiti didn't persuade them and the Spitfire is now out. Nonetheless, James is proud of his efforts and dreams of sparking a serious campaign to have it accepted as the new English national anthem. 'It was worth the time and expense. It needs to be majesterial. Sporting events are one of the few times when the English feel a sense of national identity, which is a shame in a way. This was worth doing properly.' We get off the train at Tiverton and catch a cab to Hirst's place, which is about an hour away, near the coastal village of Combe Martin. If you ask Hirst what exactly he does in Fat Les, he'll smile raffishly and reply, 'I haven't a fucking clue.' If you ask James, he'll tell you that Hirst 'paints the taxi'. This is a reference to the black cab that Allen bought on a whim one day. He parked it outside the Groucho Club, but was seldom sober enough to drive it anywhere when he left. Fortunately, the tramp who camped outside, who is still known as 'Outside Dave', turned out to have a driving licence and Allen promptly hired him as his part-time chauffeur. Eventually, he suggested that Dave take to living in the vehicle, in return for transport home when necessary. The residents of Combe Martin have lots of similar stories to tell, about finding Allen and Hirst sitting atop chimneys hatching plans, or Allen leading gaggles of teenage girls up to the house to gaze at 'Alex from Blur' drooling into his pillow, asleep. Damien Hirst is still in bed, but we find Allen strolling on the beach with several other people, including Maia Hirst, the artist's Californian partner of 10 years or so, and their improbably angelic eight-day-old baby, Cassius. Allen, at a spry 46, is a good deal older than the others, and began as a confrontational stand-up comedian on the 'alternative comedy' circuit of the early 80s. He's mellowed over the years as his acting career has burgeoned, but is still capable of frightening outbursts when he feels the situation requires it. His laddish image, he contends, is undeserved. The old anger was a defence mechanism in response to a remote and aggressive father, and he doesn't need it any more, even if it probably helps him relate to Hirst. Watching the two egg each other on makes for an unsettling, though frequently entertaining, spectacle. There is nothing, you feel, that they couldn't persuade each other to do, and whether this stems from an absence of fear or an excess of it, I can't tell. Somehow, Hirst's bravado is less convincing, more forced. The Hirst estate covers one side of a chocolate box valley and is unspeakably lovely. A stone farmhouse with spare, modern interior stands amid picturesque gardens and Hansel and Gretel woods and grassy hills. The ground floor contains a smart open-plan kitchen and sitting area, scattered with art debris and a large tank in which fish swim among a selection of rubbish, including false teeth, a model shark and an old beer bottle. Ask friends and acquaintances to describe their owner and the phrase you will hear again and again is 'the cleverest person I know.' Often this will be quickly followed by 'and the rudest'. Charged with finding words to describe his colleague, the first thing Allen comes up with is 'Tourette's-like', a reference to the medical condition where sufferers lose all social inhibition, becoming progressively more foul-mouthed and intemperate. None of the above will quite prepare you for the reality of meeting Damien Hirst, though. Short, with a gruff Yorkshire accent and head that looks as though it was intended for someone a foot taller, the people he most immediately puts me in mind of are Robin Williams, Bill Hicks and John Cooper Clarke. In conversation, you feel like the taxi driver who's been ordered to follow a car which is already disappearing round a bend. Some of the exchanges between Allen and him during the photo shoot, little improvised skits about Bloko Ono and One Rasta and His Dog, provoke tears of laughter. Afterwards, Allen guffaws, 'You realise that this is going to slaughter Damon. He hates this stuff! It could be the end of Blur!' and James looks somewhat perturbed. Unlike Allen, who is easy to be around, there is a sharp edge, perhaps even a cruelty, to Hirst's wit. He seems to have an instinctive feel for people's weaknesses and you can watch him home in directly on these. He doesn't do small talk and warmth doesn't come easily, though he is reputedly a loyal and generous friend. I know of at least one person who will attest that he is also handy with his fists. Sitting down to talk one-to-one, without an audience, is fascinating, if peculiar. You're never sure what level of irony he is operating on and have to be on your toes at all times. A snatched, heavily censored exchange goes something like this: 'You recently admitted that you \"got sick of being Damien Hirst\" after winning the Turner Prize. Is that what your reinvention as a tycoon was about?' 'I don't know. What's a tycoon? I still am one. As I've said, art's a business. And if it's as important as they say it is, then I think money can't affect it. You have to separate the desire to make art from the desire to be famous. I'm into both and I think they're both about the same thing, which is that you want to live for ever.' 'Has the arrival of Cassius affected your attitude to work?' 'Yeah, he's a week and one day old and I've already learnt more from him than I could ever possibly teach him. Not bad in a week, though, is it? Bet your dad never told you that. I'm not going to tell him, either - haha.' 'What's he taught you?' 'How trivial and irrelevant it all is. And how small you are. That this world's for real. That if you're bored, you're off your knackers, you know what I mean? Buy a microscope if you're bored. It's just amazing. You look in his eyes and go, \"He's brand new!\" You forget that you were and things can be. He's got no idea who Damien Hirst is or what Fat Les is, or what art is_ I think our denial of death is what our lives are about, but I don't think that's negative. I mean, I'll tell you what. I don't believe in God, or I didn't believe in God_ I don't believe in God, but I find it very difficult to not believe in God and still believe in art at the moment. I don't know where it's going to go.' 'What are you going to do about that?' 'I don't know yet. I can live with the conflicts. But I'm definitely not going to sweep it under the carpet. If you're an artist, you can't skirt the issues - you're nothing if you do.' Hirst continues on the theme of fatherhood, bringing Allen into the equation. Allen has between five and seven children, with different mothers. He is the type of man self-respecting women tend to disapprove of, while being highly attracted to. Hirst's mum once suggested that he was a negligent father, but Damien disagreed. 'I said, \"How can you say he's not a good father? He doesn't lie to his kids.\" My dad said he was going to be there forever, then stood up and fucked off. Keith says that all kids need is eye contact. When he told me that, I said, \"You what?\" But it's true.' Missing here are variously mystifying rants on fame, money, drugs, death, Mussolini, car crashes, the farm and Fat Les (which he has nothing printable to say about). One thing which does emerge is that, over the past 18 months, Hirst has rediscovered his inspiration and the September show at New York's Gagosian already sounds, on the word of people who've seen the material, like a return to form. Lost Love and Love Lost , two room-sized fish tanks containing complete gynaecologists' offices, one with hundreds of bright tropical fish, the other with British course fish, are mentioned as favourites.

For those who've yet to see it, there's one strong female character, Lucilla, played by Connie Nielsen, but it's Crowe's Maximus who gets to wear the short skirts. Despite, or maybe because of, this garb, Maximus emerges as cinema's most potent symbol of male physicality and integrity since Marlon Brando's T-shirt-splitting turn in Streetcar.

Indeed, ultra-males, by which I mean straight men other straight men are actively encouraged to 'admire', seem to be making a comeback generally. It says something that when I went to see Gladiator, there were so many lone males in the audience, the cinema had the ambience of a very dark football match. Like certain sports, action movies seem to give men the excuse to stare at other men (fit, sweaty, under-dressed men) for hours on end without their sexuality being called into question. With so few female fans of the action-movie genre, it has to be seen as peculiar that the likes of Arnie, Jean-Claude and Sly spend the bulk of their careers in loincloths or wisps of combat gear. </p> <p>Watching Gladiator, you wonder what modern men are so starved of, what spiritual and psychic emaciation is going on, that this kind of beautifully paced, almost balletic machismo and bloodlust still manage to push all the right buttons. That other Roman epic, Caligula, made the mistake of playing the sex card, but the makers of Gladiator were clever enough to realise that men find violence far sexier. There is also the sense that the violence in Gladiator is happening in the name of a principle, and guys are suckers for that, too. Men keep raving about the 'technical brilliance' of the fight sequences, but I suspect what they really love is the primitive allure of righteous violence. </p> <p>It can't be seen as a coincidence that, early on, Crowe is given a slain wife to establish his Death Wish BC credentials. Then it's 'guy stuff' all the way. Never mind the dead missus, it soon becomes clear that the real loves of Maximus's life are honour, valour, brotherhood, and hitting people in the face with an axe. The message rings out loud and clear: then as now, chicks are just holding guys back from their natural destiny. All men would live their lives in a blizzard of testosterone if they could. </p> <p>Delusional codswallop, of course. Indeed, if you believe that 'Just Gay Enough' stuff currently doing the round of magazines, the only blizzard modern man is likely to encounter is when he drops his tubs of exfoliating scrub on the bathroom floor. Then again, do we believe the 'Just Gay Enough' stuff? Women are supposed to be finding themselves attracted to guys with girly faces like Leonardo DiCaprio, but I have yet to meet a female over 12 who doesn't scream with laughter at the thought of DiCaprio naked. However, even if no one buys into the 'Just Gay Enough' principle, is the overkill of Gladiator really a healthy example to set for the youth of today? </p> <p>After all, it's not just men who find Crowe attractive. As Maximus, Crowe has a unisex appeal, exuding the same quality, a combination of grizzled stillness and certainty, that made Steve McQueen the most attractive male chauvinist pig in Hollywood history. So much so that when even the most right-thinking feminist females heard that he'd kept his wife, Ali McGraw, downtrodden, barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen for years, the only possible response was: 'Jammy cow.' </p> <p>But that's fantasy, just as Gladiator (based on real events) is pure unadulterated male fantasy. Gladiator is such a guys' movie, most women are probably feeling like I did - that they were spying on the male population. In a movie filled with images of speared tigers, squealing livestock and upturned horses, one half-expects to see the final disclaimer: 'No gender stereotypes were harmed in the making of this movie.' For, in this ultra-male role, Crowe shows that, in movies as in life, androgyny is so over, and absolutism is back in. The essential triumph and tragedy of Gladiator is that it holds a flashlight to the dark, hairy, knuckle-dragging corners of the male psyche which neither time nor evolution seem able to exfoliate away. </p>",

      "body": "<p>What would you expect from a website that had the message: 'Warning. Gospel teaching ahead.' Warning? This is what you get. 'Matthew Shepard died on October 12, 1998, after being brutally beaten by two demon-possessed hooligans... One of God's commandments is \"thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination.\" Matthew Shepard lived his life breaking this commandment. Unless he repented in his dying hours (and we hope he did), he is in hell - the same fate his killers will receive unless they repent.'</p> <p>Welcome to the disturbing world of hate sites on the net, a world where people using Netscape Communicator with the proper plug ins can 'place your mouse pointer over the image to hear Matthew scream'. Or 'If this doesn't work, see Matthew's message from hell'.</p> <p>The above commentary is from the US website of the Westboro Baptist Church, <a href=\"http://www.godhatesfags.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.godhatesfags.com</a>. It is just one of hundreds of websites, mailing lists, newsgroups and bulletin boards included in The Hate Directory, a list of sites that 'advocate violence against, separation from, defamation of, deception about, or hostility toward others based upon race, religion, ethnicity, gender or sexual orientation'.</p> <p>They vary in hue and content. The Christian Holocaust site contains a photograph of a real-life crucifixion and graphic 'testimonials'. The Adolf Hitler and National Socialist Multi Media Memorial Gallery begins: 'This website is RACIST. Non-Aryans are NOT welcome.'</p> <p>Ray Franklin, 50, the assistant director of the Police Training Commission in Maryland, and an internet consultant to law-enforcement organisations worldwide, has compiled the Hate Directory, at <a href=\"http://www.hatedirectory.com\" target=\"_NEW\">www.hatedirectory.com</a>, a guide for teachers, parents and the police. What began four years ago as a single-page hand-out is now published quarterly and has grown to 35 pages. It makes depressing reading. There are revisionist, misogynist and supremacist sites of all kinds, but the vast majority are white supremacist. The list is particularly long on As (for Aryan), Ks (for Knights of the Ku Klux Klan) and Ws (for White). One that has been accused of complicity in racist crimes of violence is the World Church of the Creator site, home of the white power Creativity Movement. It includes a children's games page. 'Games' turn out to be racist crosswords. There is nothing to stop children logging on: unlike with hardcore porn sites, you don't need a credit card to gain access.</p> <p>Some of the sites on the Hate Directory vanish almost as soon as they appear on the list. They are thrown off servers when the Internet Service Providers hosting them realise what they are. This has created a new business opportunity. Unrestricted-content.com's website ad runs: 'We can get you on a trouble-free server in less than 48 hrs. We have found hosts for sites featuring unusual sex, conspiracy theories, underground and criminal suppliers, Anonymous Services, Secret Banking, Hate Groups, Anarchy Archives, Militia, even Psychopaths.'</p> <p>Some 'hate group' sites are designed to shock. Most attempt to justify their ideologies using intellectual posturing ('It is the fate of the revisionist historian to wander the frontiers beyond party and dogma, cognisant of the original sin of his own subjectivity') to bogus science (the Negroid Research Institute) to pseudo-religious pronouncements for the simple-minded ('Yggdrasil says: \"Multi-Racial Empires everywhere crumble. They are a bad idea\"').</p> <p>Famous names are another favourite - Rousseau crops up on sites to propagate both anti-Semitism and misogyny. Other groups have learned the lessons of political 'spin'. 'The Knights of the Ku Klux Klan is a love group, not a hate group,' claims the official site. 'It is not hatred but rather the glimmer of hope in the eyes of our children that motivates us.' We're on the other side of the looking glass, people.</p> <p>HateWatch, a monitoring organisation at <a href=\"http://www.hatewatch.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.hatewatch.co.uk</a>, lists a number of UK skinhead and Nazi-affiliated sites. But hate sites are more prevalent in the US, where free speech is an inalienable right. In Britain, there are stricter laws.

      "bodyText": "What would you expect from a website that had the message: 'Warning. Gospel teaching ahead.' Warning? This is what you get. 'Matthew Shepard died on October 12, 1998, after being brutally beaten by two demon-possessed hooligans... One of God's commandments is \"thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination.\" Matthew Shepard lived his life breaking this commandment. Unless he repented in his dying hours (and we hope he did), he is in hell - the same fate his killers will receive unless they repent.' Welcome to the disturbing world of hate sites on the net, a world where people using Netscape Communicator with the proper plug ins can 'place your mouse pointer over the image to hear Matthew scream'. Or 'If this doesn't work, see Matthew's message from hell'. The above commentary is from the US website of the Westboro Baptist Church, www.godhatesfags.com. It is just one of hundreds of websites, mailing lists, newsgroups and bulletin boards included in The Hate Directory, a list of sites that 'advocate violence against, separation from, defamation of, deception about, or hostility toward others based upon race, religion, ethnicity, gender or sexual orientation'. They vary in hue and content. The Christian Holocaust site contains a photograph of a real-life crucifixion and graphic 'testimonials'. The Adolf Hitler and National Socialist Multi Media Memorial Gallery begins: 'This website is RACIST. Non-Aryans are NOT welcome.' Ray Franklin, 50, the assistant director of the Police Training Commission in Maryland, and an internet consultant to law-enforcement organisations worldwide, has compiled the Hate Directory, at www.hatedirectory.com, a guide for teachers, parents and the police. What began four years ago as a single-page hand-out is now published quarterly and has grown to 35 pages. It makes depressing reading. There are revisionist, misogynist and supremacist sites of all kinds, but the vast majority are white supremacist. The list is particularly long on As (for Aryan), Ks (for Knights of the Ku Klux Klan) and Ws (for White). One that has been accused of complicity in racist crimes of violence is the World Church of the Creator site, home of the white power Creativity Movement. It includes a children's games page. 'Games' turn out to be racist crosswords. There is nothing to stop children logging on: unlike with hardcore porn sites, you don't need a credit card to gain access. Some of the sites on the Hate Directory vanish almost as soon as they appear on the list. They are thrown off servers when the Internet Service Providers hosting them realise what they are. This has created a new business opportunity. Unrestricted-content.com's website ad runs: 'We can get you on a trouble-free server in less than 48 hrs. We have found hosts for sites featuring unusual sex, conspiracy theories, underground and criminal suppliers, Anonymous Services, Secret Banking, Hate Groups, Anarchy Archives, Militia, even Psychopaths.' Some 'hate group' sites are designed to shock. Most attempt to justify their ideologies using intellectual posturing ('It is the fate of the revisionist historian to wander the frontiers beyond party and dogma, cognisant of the original sin of his own subjectivity') to bogus science (the Negroid Research Institute) to pseudo-religious pronouncements for the simple-minded ('Yggdrasil says: \"Multi-Racial Empires everywhere crumble. They are a bad idea\"'). Famous names are another favourite - Rousseau crops up on sites to propagate both anti-Semitism and misogyny. Other groups have learned the lessons of political 'spin'. 'The Knights of the Ku Klux Klan is a love group, not a hate group,' claims the official site. 'It is not hatred but rather the glimmer of hope in the eyes of our children that motivates us.' We're on the other side of the looking glass, people. HateWatch, a monitoring organisation at www.hatewatch.co.uk, lists a number of UK skinhead and Nazi-affiliated sites. But hate sites are more prevalent in the US, where free speech is an inalienable right. In Britain, there are stricter laws. Richard Harrison, IT partner at the law firm Laytons says: 'Hate groups with UK sites will have to be careful - all sorts of legislation can be brought to bear.' But even with powers to prosecute, locating site creators could prove extremely difficult. British Internet Service Providers are also held responsible for material that appears on their servers. Ray Franklin foresees hate groups utilising new communications technologies because they are cheap and effective. 'Just as the Nazis exploited film, radio and electronic public address, modern hatemongers will exploit internet multicast capabilities, satellite subcarrier broadcasting, high-fidelity MP3 hate-centred music distribution, and so on.' Indeed, whatever technology has to offer, one thing seems certain. The next issue of the Hate Directory will be more than 35 pages long.",

Essentially, Napster enables millions of people to run their own mini-MP3 servers. It took off like a rocket - to the point where some US universities have forbidden students to run it on their machines because it consumes too much network bandwidth (and, of course, because the universities fear the attentions of m'learned friends). Since not even the recording companies have enough resources to serve millions of writs, they have gone after the mating-agency and are currently suing the pants off Napster. The case hasn't been decided yet, but in fact the verdict doesn't matter because the Net is already moving on. A group of Open Source programmers, realising that the weakness of Napster is its need for a centralised node, has come up with FreeNet - a publication system similar to the Web but with one major advantage: it doesn't store information at fixed locations. FreeNet therefore allows material to be published with less fear of censorship because individual files cannot be traced to their source or even to where they are physically stored. Sooner or later, someone is going to realise that the collective IQ of the Net is greater than that of any industry - and that it would be better to go with the MP3 flow rather than fighting it. That person will make a packet. We don't yet know who it will be, but we can be sure of one thing: she doesn't work for a record company. john.naughton@observer.co.uk",

Founded 18 months ago by three photogenic twentysomething Swedes - Leander, Patrik Hedelin and Ernst Malmsten - the firm secured finance from big-name backers such as Bernard Arnault, head of the French luxury goods group LVMH, and the Benetton family. </p> <p>The new firm raised more than \u00a3100 million, a record for an Internet start-up, and the omens looked good for the three founders, who hold a 35 per cent stake in the business. But by the middle of last week, as accountant KPMG was appointed liquidators, boo had broken the bank. Sources say it is millions of pounds in debt. The collapse means the loss of 300 jobs, 200 of them in London. </p> <p>Part of the company's early success in securing financing came because Malmsten and Leander had that rarest of things: a pedigree in creating Internet start-ups. The two had launched and sold their Swedish online bookstore, <a href=\"http://www.Bokus.com\" target=\"_new\">Bokus.com</a>, and gained the sort of respect the City accords to alchemists. Malmsten and Leander even managed to get on to the front page of the US's prestigious Fortune magazine. </p> <p>They made an odd couple. Malmsten used to be a poetry critic; Leander was an ex-model with the Elite agency. When Bokus was taken over, the pair left its board. </p> <p>The rise and fall of boo is a cautionary tale of our times. It attempted to build a global brand - operating in 18 countries - by spending millions of pounds on positioning itself as a funky streetwise company which would blow the cobwebs out of the fashion market. </p> <p>From the start, boo went into hyper party mode. Employees jetted around Europe throwing lavish bashes in a bid to win over the fashion industry. Tales abound of sybaritic parties at the company's London HQ, just off Carnaby Street. The modelling crowd flocked to the champagne-fuelled shindigs. Leander liked to film each party with a video camera. 'She liked to think of herself as a photo-journalist,' one insider said. Another party-goer added: 'The parties were amazing. They really knew how to entertain.' </p> <p>Boo's hedonism could have stemmed from the pages of The Great Gatsby. As its founders and employees enjoyed the high life, however, the business was floundering. A launch date of spring 1999 was postponed six times. It finally got off the ground six months later. </p> <p>Despite this setback, boo still opened costly offices in London, Paris, New York, Munich and Stockholm. The company's main call centre, employing 80 people, was housed expensively at its London HQ, instead of using a cheaper site elsewhere. </p> <p>The jet-set lifestyle was largely unnecessary. 'Most of the flying around seemed to be for the sake of it,' said one insider. 'Instead of a phone call it was a case of \"let's fly to New York\".' No one seemed to want to stop the party. </p> <p>Azeem Azhar, founder of Internet incubator esouk, said: 'It really shows you need good financial controls within companies. It's a lesson for all of us. You need to watch the beans.' </p> <p>It took boo six months to appoint Dean Hawkins, formerly a big hitter with Adidas, as its chief financial officer last January. But Hawkins resigned two months later to join a Dutch Internet company, a move that dealt a body blow to boo's credibility. </p> <p>But it was the unfettered marketing costs which really crippled boo. They were the main contributor to a cash burn rate of more than \u00a31m a week. By March the company had spent a reported \u00a330m on advertising and marketing. Admittedly, a large-scale television advertising campaign drew critical applause, but even this lacked impact with potential customers. </p> <p>Richard Heygate, chief executive of Sophron, a company which builds Internet businesses, said: 'In our experience, the big advertising agencies take a 20 per cent commission on the costs of a campaign. Until you've built up customer loyalty, you don't spend millions advertising, because you don't have sufficient revenue streams.

Helen Thomas, now nearing 80, was poised to tackle a ninth - until the worldwide wire service with which her name had become synonymous was taken over by the Rev Sun Myong Moon's Unification Church. </p> <p>A formidable woman, famous for asking the first question at White House news conferences, Thomas won't be asking them any more - at least not for United Press International (UPI). For the first time in four decades, her front-row seat in the briefing room was empty last Tuesday. After 57 years she quit the near-bankrupt but once-venerated wire service rather than work for its controversial new owners. </p> <p>'This room will not be the same without Helen sitting in the UPI chair,' White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart told reporters. 'She's been there for longer than I've been alive, and knows more than I'll ever know about this business, about this building, about this town.' </p> <p>In an era of mammoth media mergers - AOL Time Warner, Times Mirror and Tribune among them - the sale and financial bail-out of the struggling UPI, even to the Unification Church, would have garnered relatively little in the way of headlines had it not been for Thomas's sudden departure. </p> <p>'UPI has been bought and sold so many times that many journalists yawn when it happens again,' says Howard Kurtz, the Washington Post 's media correspondent. 'But Helen Thomas is an institu tion; a woman whose voice is known to everyone in America, that's what makes it so significant - a bit of a Potemkin village story though it is, in that no newspaper I read carries UPI stories any more. It's just sad.' </p> <p>In its heyday in the late 1950s, when it had more than 5,000 newspaper and broadcast clients, UPI was a formidable rival of the larger, richer Associated Press, which it famously beat on 22 November 1963 with first news of President Kennedy's assassination. Its reporter, Howard K. Smith, refused to relinquish the only car phone in the Dallas motorcade to the AP man, Jack Bell. </p> <p>But only a year after its Pulitzer prize-winning scoop, UPI started losing money - battered by the rise of television news, but mainly a victim of the shrinking afternoon newspaper market it served. </p> <p>The product of a 1958 merger between United Press and William Randolph Hearst's International News Service, UPI never recovered. </p> <p>The agency was sold in 1982 by the Scripps Howard newspaper chain to two inexperienced entrepreneurs from Nashville, Tennessee, for $5m. </p> <p>It changed hands three more times in 10 years, falling on particularly harsh times in the 1990s. Where it once boasted 1,500 reporters and 200 bureaux around the world, UPI now has a skeletal staff of 157, having lost most of its newspaper clients and sold key assets to AP and Reuters. </p> <p>'For decades the UPI name meant professionalism, hard-hitting, solid and quick-fire journalism,' says Felicity Berenger, the New York Times 's print media correspondent. 'Helen was a huge part of that historic lustre, a brilliant journalist. But tell me this: have you read a UPI story in the past decade? When was the last time you actually read Helen Thomas?' </p> <p>Such has been the decline of a news agency whose alumni of American journalistic greats included the legendary CBS anchorman Walter Cronkite, news of its sale to Moon's church elicited none of the usual outrage or wringing of hands about declining standards. </p> <p>'It's unlikely we'll see much of a difference, at least not initially,' says Berenger. 'Sure it's all very sad, and yes, the Washington Times is very conservative, but then again so is the New York Post and the Detroit News .' </p> <p>Nonetheless it will be an uphill struggle for UPI to regain clients and editorial clout with the loss of credibility Thomas's resignation portends. </p> <p>'For most of us, she was UPI,' said ABC's Sam Donaldson, the famed former White House correspondent who sat next to her for years. 'To me, UPI just died.' </p> <p>UPI president Arnold de Borchgrave said he tried in vain to persuade Thomas that Moon's church - best known for presiding over mass weddings, but also the owner of News World Communications Inc. and its conservative daily, the Washington Times - would not interfere with her writing. </p> <p>Thomas, who relentlessly pursued Presidents Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, Bush and Clinton around the world and the West Wing with unrivalled persistence, refused to answer reporters' questions about her decision, issuing one brief statement: 'UPI is a great news agency. It has made a remarkable mark in the annals of American journalism and has left a superb legacy for future journalists. I wish the new owners all the best, great stories and happy landings.' </p> <p>But Lee Michael Katz, who quit the same day as UPI's international editor, said he had no doubt about the reasons for her departure: 'Look at the timing of this, and Helen's devotion.' He said that his own decision was 'a no-brainer' and added: 'I cannot work for the new owners.' </p> <p>According to de Borchgrave, UPI had entertained offers from some 10 other suitors, including the former CNN financial anchor Lou Dobbs, and the Canadian newspaper mogul and Daily Telegraph owner Conrad Black, as well as the Internet service provider PSINet. He insisted his former position as editor-in-chief of the Washington Times had had nothing to do with the Moon deal. </p> <p>His former paper was quick to hit back at its rival, the Washington Post , for its assertion in a report about the UPI sale that Moon himself was the 'conservative voice behind the Times ' editorials'. </p> <p>In a blistering editorial headlined 'Response to a Lie', Wesley Pruden, the Times 's editor-in-chief, said neither Moon nor the Unification Church 'control, contribute or influence in any way any editorial, or any news dispatch, in the Times ...I cannot imagine why the Post printed such a lie'. </p> <p>Whatever Moon's editorial influence, News World Communications insists UPI, sold by its Saudi owners for an undisclosed sum, will continue 'as an independent news-gathering operation, while upgrading its capacity with new technologies and distribution practices'. In other words, it aims to become - like every other newspaper and broadcaster - a force on the Internet. </p> <p>In the meantime, the grande dame of the White House briefing room can content herself with all the glowing tributes, spelling as they do certain bestseller status for her recently published memoir, Front Row at the White House . </p> <p>There, her absence has already sparked an unseemly scramble for prime vantage point as well as her office, which the Reuters news service is reported to want 'desperately'. </p> <p>But it is to the AP's Terence Hunt, now the most senior White House correspondent with 19 years on the beat, that the ultimate honour will be bestowed. Hunt will be asking the first question now.</p>",

'For most of us, she was UPI,' said ABC's Sam Donaldson, the famed former White House correspondent who sat next to her for years. 'To me, UPI just died.' UPI president Arnold de Borchgrave said he tried in vain to persuade Thomas that Moon's church - best known for presiding over mass weddings, but also the owner of News World Communications Inc. and its conservative daily, the Washington Times - would not interfere with her writing. Thomas, who relentlessly pursued Presidents Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, Bush and Clinton around the world and the West Wing with unrivalled persistence, refused to answer reporters' questions about her decision, issuing one brief statement: 'UPI is a great news agency. It has made a remarkable mark in the annals of American journalism and has left a superb legacy for future journalists. I wish the new owners all the best, great stories and happy landings.' But Lee Michael Katz, who quit the same day as UPI's international editor, said he had no doubt about the reasons for her departure: 'Look at the timing of this, and Helen's devotion.' He said that his own decision was 'a no-brainer' and added: 'I cannot work for the new owners.' According to de Borchgrave, UPI had entertained offers from some 10 other suitors, including the former CNN financial anchor Lou Dobbs, and the Canadian newspaper mogul and Daily Telegraph owner Conrad Black, as well as the Internet service provider PSINet. He insisted his former position as editor-in-chief of the Washington Times had had nothing to do with the Moon deal. His former paper was quick to hit back at its rival, the Washington Post , for its assertion in a report about the UPI sale that Moon himself was the 'conservative voice behind the Times ' editorials'. In a blistering editorial headlined 'Response to a Lie', Wesley Pruden, the Times 's editor-in-chief, said neither Moon nor the Unification Church 'control, contribute or influence in any way any editorial, or any news dispatch, in the Times ...I cannot imagine why the Post printed such a lie'. Whatever Moon's editorial influence, News World Communications insists UPI, sold by its Saudi owners for an undisclosed sum, will continue 'as an independent news-gathering operation, while upgrading its capacity with new technologies and distribution practices'. In other words, it aims to become - like every other newspaper and broadcaster - a force on the Internet. In the meantime, the grande dame of the White House briefing room can content herself with all the glowing tributes, spelling as they do certain bestseller status for her recently published memoir, Front Row at the White House . There, her absence has already sparked an unseemly scramble for prime vantage point as well as her office, which the Reuters news service is reported to want 'desperately'. But it is to the AP's Terence Hunt, now the most senior White House correspondent with 19 years on the beat, that the ultimate honour will be bestowed. Hunt will be asking the first question now.",

In addition, further guidance would be provided by what Daley described as 'the most influential business group advising government on US-EU commercial relations', the Transatlantic Business Dialogue (TABD). 'Your encouragement,' he admonished the Minister, 'would be helpful.' </p> <p>As Butch said to Sundance, Who are these guys? TABD is a working group of the West's 100 most powerful chief executives. When presidents, prime ministers and other transitory heads of state meet at the World Trade Organisation, this more permanent grouping provides their agenda. </p> <p>The TABD's system is masterfully efficient. One US bigwig is paired with one European for each sector grouping. For example, Monsanto's Robert Harness and Unilever's Huib Vigeveno are in charge of Agri-Biotech. </p> <p>The US government and the EU each assign an official to each industry pair. TABD has privileged access not to small fry, but to top bananas such as Pascal Lamy, European Commissioner for Trade, and Erkki Liikanen, Commissioner for Enterprise and the Information Society. </p> <p>Next week, the officials will report to their corporate duos on the headway they have made on the 33 items on the current TABD implementation table. This lists 33 environment, consumer and worker protection laws in selected nations which TABD wishes to defeat or water down. </p> <p>The corporates will render their verdict on what TABD calls the scorecard. This will then be turned over, along with a new implementation table - including agenda items for the WTO - to Presidents Clinton and Prodi at their summit meeting in Portugal later this month. </p> <p>The 1988 implementation table, one of the first documents obtained, grudgingly, from the EC under its access to information rules, makes good reading for those wanting to know what's planned for our brave new world. </p> <p>For example, several of the 'tetra-partite groups' (the two-on-two government-business trysting sessions) seek expansion for something called the MRA. The initials stand for Mutual Recognition Agreement, or what the TABD describes as, 'approved once, accepted everywhere'. It is the globalisers' cruise missile. </p> <p>Here's an example of how it works. Years ago the Pfizer company manufactured defective heart valves which cracked, killing 165 patients in whom they had been implanted. Understandably, this made Europe wary of accepting devices merely because they had been blessed by the US Food and Drug Administration. But the MRA brushes aside individual nations' health and safety regulatory reviews - including individual regulation of medical device manufacturing plants. </p> <p>Given the ill-feeling in Europe about genetic modification, the MRA rules for GM products are devilishly complex and savvy, effectively applying only to the developing nations. Does Brazil have a problem with Monsanto's Bovine Growth hormone? Sorry, approval by the WTO's Codex Alimentarius committee means Brazil must accept the product or face WTO trade sanctions. </p> <p>The US, too, is a target of TABD's contempt for consumer protection. TABD's products liability group, under the guise of eliminating 'non-tariff' trade barriers, takes aim at the unique right of American citizens to sue corporate bad guys. One TABD proposal would reverse the $5 billion judgment against Exxon in the Exxon Valdez oil spill case. </p> <p>Recently, however, the TABD lobby locomotive has been slowed by lambs on the tracks. </p> <p>The demonstrations in Seattle and Washington had, according to TABD members I interviewed, an effect far beyond anything the demonstrators themselves could have imagined. The first purpose of the WTO meeting was to launch a new round of cuts in import duties and a push to eliminate more of the rules covering imports, known as non-tariff regulatory barriers. That went up in tear-gas smoke. Sweating under the TV lights, the WTO shrank from voting a new 'comprehensive round'. </p> <p>Worse, TABD's deregulation programme was publicly rejected by an erstwhile ally. The implementation table clearly told government officials, on page 17, that 'the basic purpose of an MAI [Multilateral Agreement on Investments] should not be undermined by language on labour policy and environmental policy', dicta adopted by the US and EC. </p> <p>Yet there was Bill Clinton, spooked by opinion polls showing public support for the demonstrators' views, telling the Seattle audience weepy-eyed stories of the horrors of child labour in Brazil. </p> <p>Business leaders were infuriated. Frustration with their former champion Clinton burst into the open two weeks ago when, at a meeting of the International Chamber of Commerce in Budapest, industrialists shouted down a proposal to 'dialogue' with non-governmental organisations such as Amnesty International. </p> <p>'I don't believe that those who were in Seattle represented somebody with a legitimate stake,' fumed Peter Sutherland, head of investment bank Goldman Sachs UK. Sutherland, who jumped to Goldman from his post as director of the WTO, prefers the company of his own kind. 'We have to be very careful on engaging in this debate, as those NGOs [non-governmental organisations] should not have a say with government!' (Interestingly, the Goldman bank chaired the TABD when Sutherland was running the WTO.) </p> <p>Clinton had wimped out on business. But, just in time, the Chambers of Commerce have found a new knight errant. </p> <p>'Tony Blair, he was great! He had guts! That's the leadership we need,' economist Jagdish Bhagwati, globalisation guru, told the disheartened suits in Budapest. He applauded the PM for speaking out, 'against anti-capitalist NGOs'. </p> <p>When I spoke with Bhagwati this week, he contrasted Clinton's 'absurd, ignorant' pleas for Brazil's child labourers with the attitude of Clare Short. Bhagwati, who sat next to the International Development Secretary at the WTO in Seattle, described with giggly approval how she kept him in stitches, mocking a speaker from the African National Congress while the ANC man spoke of the connection between globalisation and child labour. 'No one in the Clinton administration would have done that.' No, they would not. </p> <p>Businessmen lobbying their way into government offices is an old story, but the supercharged TABD version - infiltration by invitation - began only in 1995 as the brainchild of Ron Brown, Clinton's first Commerce Secretary. </p> <p>Brown, who died in a 1996 air crash, was Clinton's Mandelson, architect of the scheme to turn Democrats into New Democrats, the party of business. When Brown died, Clinton's passion for pairing with business passed away too, not uninfluenced by the demolition of the New Democrats in the 1994 Congressional elections. </p> <p>Clinton lopped off the 'New' label - take note, Tony - when his good buddies in industry, sensing his weakness, rushed back to their natural home in the Republican Party. </p> <p>Clinton still goes through the motions of meeting TABD, as required by commercial realpolitik, but its leaders, such as Jim Wootten of the US Chamber of Commerce, tell me they doubt the President's sincerity. </p> <p>But Blair is different. 'Blair really believes ,' says Bhagwati admiringly of Blair's globalising fervour. And TABD members agree. Unlike that scamp from Arkansas whose expressions of policy are as inconstant as his expressions of fidelity, Blair is a man of convictions. His heart leaps at visions of a flexible labour force, of entrepreneurs liberated from bureaucrats' rule-books, of a new economy relieved of the antique task of bending metal into Rovers. </p> <p>In 1997, according to US documents, Blair personally stepped over Margaret Beckett to water down regulations permitting Americans to build gas-fired power plants in the UK. He also hopped about to accomplish the other three tasks on the US Commerce Secretary's favours list. </p> <p>Don't dismiss this as just a series of tawdry fixes. The Prime Minister rolled out the golden doormat in Downing Street to American companies because he looks on these bold screw-the-rules operators as an entrepreneurial stud pool whom he hopes will breed with and revitalise the hoof-dragging local stock. </p> <p>It's sad, really. Unlike Clinton, who wised up quickly, Blair confuses the TABD's self-serving wishlist with a programme of economic salvation. </p> <p>He trusts his industry darlings will never leave his side. But as his re-election becomes ever more doubtful, he will find that, as they say in Arkansas, Tony's been kissed - but he ain't been loved. </p> <p> <a href=\"mailto:gregory.palast@theguardian.com\">gregory.palast@theguardian.com</a></p>",

      "body": "<p>In case you missed it, last week the Government fell apart.

But an alternative scenario could be that it is gauging response to one of the most important questions leading up to the next election. Is the crisis in manufacturing and the mass redundancies that could come because of it enough of a factor to change voter scepticism about the euro? </p> <p>Because short of intervention or purchase of European denominated assets, a positive stance and timetable for joining the single currency looks like the only easy way to bring sterling down. </p> <p>Questions about the pain of the pound need to be answered precisely if the Government is to address the problems of the 'heartlands' - voters it fears will desert them in key constituencies. Who is hurting, and where? </p> <p>Until recently the Government has remained unmoved. Recently Gordon Brown dismissed the CBI as just another pressure group. </p> <p>Pressure groups are there to pressurise. But the impression has been that the strong pound has been punishing all manufacturing. </p> <p>It has been blamed for the Rover debacle, for widescale job losses - some 170,000 from December 1997 to December 1999 and 98,000 in the year to the end of March - for destruction of UK customer bases overseas. </p> <p>In fact the picture is more varied. Ian Brinkley, economist at the Trades Union Congress says: 'There are significant differences between the impact of the problems on manufacturing sectors.' </p> <p>First there are sectors such as textiles and iron and steel which are exposed to price competition from low-cost producers. The exchange rate has come as an extra blow. 'These are in deep trouble and there is no sign of recovery,' he says. </p> <p>Then there are high value-added sectors such as aerospace, computers and chemicals, which account for about 50 per cent of exports by value. 'These have not done too badly.' </p> <p>Third, there are restructuring sectors. Here, industries like car manufacturing are experiencing structural problems, such as overcapacity, which mask the exchange rate effect. </p> <p>TUC work on official statistics between 1996 and 1999 across manufacturing illustrates these distinctions through sectoral trade balances, outputs and employment. </p> <p>Across all manufacturing 13 per cent export growth was exceeded by 29 per cent import growth. But iron and steel, clothing and textiles saw the export values of their exports drop by 30 per cent, 16 per cent and 6 per cent respectively. Imports fell by 7 per cent for iron and steel, but rose by 7 per cent for both clothing and textiles. </p> <p>However, chemicals and electrical equipment saw exports rise by 20 per cent and 30 per cent - although imports rose too. And while output in textiles and metals fell by 16 per cent and 5.5 per cent respectively, chemicals rose by 5.9 per cent. </p> <p>Most manufacturing sectors saw declines in employment. The top two sectors were again textiles and clothing - with 43,000 employees lost in the two years from December 1997, and metal manufacturers with 37,000 lost over the same period. </p> <p>Employers have similar stories. Dougie Peedle, economist at the Engineering Employers Federation, says: 'There are regional differences. Output is still rising in the South, whereas in areas such as South Yorkshire and Humberside, Scotland, the North-east it is falling.' </p> <p>'Metal manufacturers and producers are being very hard hit - and in Europe they are being hit by the exchange rate. But electronics companies, for example, are not facing such price pressures. They also tend to sell more into America where the pound has been more stable.' </p> <p>Exports to the EU between 1996 and 1999 rose in volume by 21 per cent while imports rose by 20 per cent. But the value of exports has barely increased at all over the period - confirming that margins are being hit. </p> <p>The non-EU trade has slumped - mainly due to the Asian financial crisis - while trade with the US has remained relatively stable. </p> <p>Andrew Cook, managing director of Sheffield-based William Cook, the world's largest steel foundry group, says the impact of the exchange rate has been disastrous. Profits have fallen from \u00a3134 million in 1998-89 to \u00a3115m in 1999-2000, largely because of the strong pound. William Cook exports about 45 per cent of its production - half to Europe and half to the US. The US has been fairly stable - in 1998/9 there was 4 per cent growth in sales. </p> <p>Cook adds: 'One of the most invidious things is that many second-tier industrial companies are disappearing. Many of our customers - for example, several world class valve makers - have closed or moved overseas.' </p> <p>The grief is not all industrial. Farmers also face big exchange rate difficulties. Alex Solomon, economist at the National Farmers Union says two effects are conspiring against UK farmers. </p> <p>First, price support from the European Commission - which underpins the price of agricultural commodities by buying up excess output - is paid in euros. So British farmers have seen the value of their support eroded. Second, since around 50 per cent of output is exported, farmers face much the same pressures as 'metal-bashers' such as William Cook. </p> <p>The average farm income is falling. In 1997/8 the average was \u00a311,000. A year later it was \u00a37,200. </p> <p>Higher-value producers are finding marked differences between the US and Europe. John Starbuck, managing director of London-based Twiflex which makes industrial disk brakes, says the company exports some 70 per cent of its output; 70 per cent of that goes to Europe and 15 per cent to the US. </p> <p>Dollar earnings have been relatively stable since 1996. But harder European exchange rates have knocked \u00a3700,000 off sales. Profits at the \u00a36m-turnover company are \u00a3200,000 lower because of thinner margins. </p> <p>The effect is particularly hard on companies like Twiflex, which have invested heavily in modern plant. They have a high break-even point but once that is reached, profits grow quickly. </p> <p>Some high value-added companies are not feeling the strain so badly. Derek Flannagan, manufacturing director of Varian Medical Systems - which makes equipment for cancer radiotherapy - says that the higher pound has made no appreciable impact. </p> <p>Varian exports 95 per cent of its \u00a340m annual production; 50 per cent of that goes to the US, with about 30 per cent going to Europe. </p> <p>'The US has been fairly level, but so has Europe,' he says. Sales have grown by 19 per cent almost uninterrupted since 1990s. </p> <p>'It could be the nature of the product - these are high value capital goods which hospitals tend to order a long way in advance,' says Flannagan. </p> <p>So although the picture is complicated it clearly isn't good for manufacturing. Given that intervention - or any change to the remit of the Monetary Policy Committee - is off the cards, are there alternatives? </p> <p>Ian Brinkly at the TUC believes so. Focusing government, union and business activity through sectoral organisations may help - like the Rover task force. Regional development agencies should also be useful. </p> <p>In the end, the calculation for Blair is whether more action to get industry out of its exchange rate problem would make enough difference to enough voters. But the current talk of splits should be encouraging for manufacturers. </p> <p>The fact is Byers has been acting as an 'outrider' on sterling and the euro for months. The DTI says it clears anything he says with the Treasury. Brown himself softened his stance earlier this month. </p> <p>The idea that Mandelson would have said what he said without a word to Blair first is unlikely. Perhaps Mandelson's musings show us that the Government is listening - and preparing to act. </p> <p><strong> Stephen Byers</strong> 27 January 2000 <br> 'Some, including a number of inward investors, will push for a commitment now to enter (the single currency) at an early stage in the next parliament.' </p> <p><strong>Robin Cook</strong> 19 March 2000 <br> 'The longer we are out of the single currency the more people will wonder if this is the place to invest rather than within the single currency zone.' </p> <p><strong> Gordon Brown </strong> 8 May 2000 <br> 'I understand the great difficulties that the fall in the euro is causing for industry, particularly manufacturing.

      "body": "<p>No one can ever be prepared for the shock of encountering a new life and all its attendant joys, but at least buying things for the baby used to be a doddle. </p> <p>The answer to every parent's practical problem was Mothercare. You want a cot? Mothercare. A buggy? Ditto. Maternity gear, newborn babygrows, even threads for pre-teens? Mothercare was the word. The chain, founded in 1961 by Selim Zelkha, had a trustworthy, fail-safe aura. </p> <p>But for Mothercare those innocent days are gone. Consumer choice and a penchant for style have permeated the British psyche, making the chain's place in the world less certain. Last Tuesday, its parent, Storehouse, was consigned to the dustbin of British corporate disasters. </p> <p>Storehouse, which went through four chief executives in 10 years, finally sold its loss-making subsidiary British Home Stores for \u00a3200 million to asset stripper Philip Green. Green's bid was rubber-stamped by disgruntled shareholders, who saw the value of their investment dive from a high of 361p in 1996 to 40.5p at Friday's close. </p> <p>The Storehouse empire was formed by Sir Terence Conran in 1986, when he merged BhS with Mothercare and Habitat. In its heyday it included Heal's, Richard Shops and Blazer - now it can boast only Mothercare. </p> <p>For the company's management team, led by chairman Alan Smith and finance director Chris Martin, last Tuesday represents year zero - and the final chance to revive one of Britain's most famous brands. </p> <p>The team faces an enormous challenge. Recent trading figures suggest that last year, Mothercare just about broke even. Yet only three years ago the company posted pre-tax profits of \u00a331m. </p> <p>Since then, it has been beset by a trading crisis. At the root of its problems was the fact that its 350 high street stores did not stock enough items, and thus failed to make money. </p> <p>The answer to this was to close 82 stores and concentrate on its larger Mothercare World outlets, where mums-to-be can manoeuvre more conveniently through aisles stocked with a comprehensive range of products. </p> <p>But just as serious for Mothercare has been its disastrous clothing strategy. Martin admits his own pre-teen children 'wouldn't be seen dead in Mothercare clothes'. </p> <p>Until recently, Mothercare sold clothes for children up to the age of 10, but they contributed a tiny portion of its \u00a3440m sales. However, Martin is adamant that the company will now focus on pre-school children. </p> <p>The company is striving to find a balance between the upmarket, designer label babywear market led by Tim Waterstone's Tom &amp; Daisy chain - along with DKNY and Ralph Lauren - and the supermarkets, led by Asda's George range and Tesco. </p> <p>To an extent Martin is succeeding. It was a measure of how far Mothercare has come that Green said recently he didn't want to buy Mothercare, because the management team was already implementing the changes he would make. </p> <p>Next month, for instance, Mothercare customers will be able to buy anything from buggies to mobiles over the Internet. </p> <p>The group is attempting to reposition itself as a leading authority on motherhood: its website will also offer chat pages and entertainment guides for mothers with youngsters. </p> <p>Within a year, the company will probably join a number of Britain's leading multiples in signing up for BSkyB's Open home shop ping service which will enable consumers who subscribe to digital satellite television to buy goods from their screens. </p> <p>But there are indications that more executive blood will be spilt. Persistent rumours suggest that chief executive Greg Tuffnell will soon be replaced. </p> <p>'He has to go,' confided a retail analyst. 'In the new order, his face doesn't fit. He is too associated with the past.' </p> <p>Martin failed to give cast iron assurances that Tuffnell's job was safe - but did say that the team delivering the the recovery will stay basically the same. Whatever happens to the internal structure, it is thought that Smith and Martin will concentrate on reviving the business to make it attractive to a prospective buyer. </p> <p>'Actually, Mothercare is not a bad brand,' said a leading Storehouse shareholder. 'They have closed most of its crap stores and sorted out the babywear range. I can't see a UK buyer coming forward, because it has been touted around for so long. 'But as progress is made, I can see an overseas company bidding for it.' </p> <p><strong>Kids' stuff</strong><br> The \u00a31.5 billion clothing market pandering to the needs of Britain's nippers has shown zero growth in real terms for the last three years. Retailers labour under the curse of a static birth rate and a fragmented market. However, doting mums, dads and grandparents are now prepared to shell out more. </p> <p>The clothing for pre-schoolers is divided between up-market designer brands, sport labels and supermarkets who sell to the market's lower end. For the affluent, style-conscious parent, entrants include Ralph Lauren, Paul Smith, DKNY and Calvin Klein. </p> <p>Ralph Lauren opened a children's store in Bond Street, London, last November which is thought to have grossed more than \u00a312m. </p> <p>BabyGap has done more than anyone to reinvent the children's clothing sector. Launched in the United States in 1989, there are now about 50 in Britain. Gap is very guarded about sales, although it says they have increased year-on-year and that their fleece-and-jean jacket format 'is incredibly successful'. </p> <p>Asda leads the supermarket pre-school pack. Its George kids' range took 7.9 per cent of the up to 4-year-old market in the year to last April - up 1.7 percentage points on the previous year - making it the most successful supermarket. Asda is now challenging the childrenswear market leader, venerable Marks &amp; Spencer. </p> <p><strong>Playing for profits</strong></p> <p><strong>Early learning centre</strong></p> <p>Its name may chime with ambitious middle-class parents eager to give their children every advantage, but until recently the chain, owned by John Menzies, the Edinburgh-based distributor and retailer, has struggled. </p> <p>Two years ago, ELC lost \u00a311.4 million, with like-for-like sales down 4.8 per cent. This led to a boardroom cull. Mike France was parachuted in as managing director. </p> <p>ELC's problem was that it had diversified away from its core toys market into clothing and nursery products. France has shut stores, replaced senior managers and made big changes to the products. Sales are now growing by nearly 10 per cent. </p> <p>Sources close to the company say that within 12 months, it will be either sold or floated out of Menzies. </p> <p><strong>Toys 'R' Us </strong> </p> <p>With world sales of $12 billion and 1,500 shops in 25 countries, Toys 'R' Us is the big daddy of child's play. It has just floated off its Japanese business and completed a $1bn buy-back of its own shares. It arrived in the UK in the Eighties, selling from characterless warehouses akin to B&amp;Q superstores.</p>",

The team faces an enormous challenge. Recent trading figures suggest that last year, Mothercare just about broke even. Yet only three years ago the company posted pre-tax profits of \u00a331m. Since then, it has been beset by a trading crisis. At the root of its problems was the fact that its 350 high street stores did not stock enough items, and thus failed to make money. The answer to this was to close 82 stores and concentrate on its larger Mothercare World outlets, where mums-to-be can manoeuvre more conveniently through aisles stocked with a comprehensive range of products. But just as serious for Mothercare has been its disastrous clothing strategy. Martin admits his own pre-teen children 'wouldn't be seen dead in Mothercare clothes'. Until recently, Mothercare sold clothes for children up to the age of 10, but they contributed a tiny portion of its \u00a3440m sales. However, Martin is adamant that the company will now focus on pre-school children. The company is striving to find a balance between the upmarket, designer label babywear market led by Tim Waterstone's Tom &amp; Daisy chain - along with DKNY and Ralph Lauren - and the supermarkets, led by Asda's George range and Tesco. To an extent Martin is succeeding. It was a measure of how far Mothercare has come that Green said recently he didn't want to buy Mothercare, because the management team was already implementing the changes he would make. Next month, for instance, Mothercare customers will be able to buy anything from buggies to mobiles over the Internet. The group is attempting to reposition itself as a leading authority on motherhood: its website will also offer chat pages and entertainment guides for mothers with youngsters. Within a year, the company will probably join a number of Britain's leading multiples in signing up for BSkyB's Open home shop ping service which will enable consumers who subscribe to digital satellite television to buy goods from their screens. But there are indications that more executive blood will be spilt. Persistent rumours suggest that chief executive Greg Tuffnell will soon be replaced. 'He has to go,' confided a retail analyst. 'In the new order, his face doesn't fit. He is too associated with the past.' Martin failed to give cast iron assurances that Tuffnell's job was safe - but did say that the team delivering the the recovery will stay basically the same. Whatever happens to the internal structure, it is thought that Smith and Martin will concentrate on reviving the business to make it attractive to a prospective buyer. 'Actually, Mothercare is not a bad brand,' said a leading Storehouse shareholder. 'They have closed most of its crap stores and sorted out the babywear range. I can't see a UK buyer coming forward, because it has been touted around for so long. 'But as progress is made, I can see an overseas company bidding for it.' Kids' stuff The \u00a31.5 billion clothing market pandering to the needs of Britain's nippers has shown zero growth in real terms for the last three years. Retailers labour under the curse of a static birth rate and a fragmented market. However, doting mums, dads and grandparents are now prepared to shell out more. The clothing for pre-schoolers is divided between up-market designer brands, sport labels and supermarkets who sell to the market's lower end. For the affluent, style-conscious parent, entrants include Ralph Lauren, Paul Smith, DKNY and Calvin Klein. Ralph Lauren opened a children's store in Bond Street, London, last November which is thought to have grossed more than \u00a312m. BabyGap has done more than anyone to reinvent the children's clothing sector. Launched in the United States in 1989, there are now about 50 in Britain. Gap is very guarded about sales, although it says they have increased year-on-year and that their fleece-and-jean jacket format 'is incredibly successful'. Asda leads the supermarket pre-school pack. Its George kids' range took 7.9 per cent of the up to 4-year-old market in the year to last April - up 1.7 percentage points on the previous year - making it the most successful supermarket. Asda is now challenging the childrenswear market leader, venerable Marks &amp; Spencer. Playing for profits Early learning centre Its name may chime with ambitious middle-class parents eager to give their children every advantage, but until recently the chain, owned by John Menzies, the Edinburgh-based distributor and retailer, has struggled. Two years ago, ELC lost \u00a311.4 million, with like-for-like sales down 4.8 per cent. This led to a boardroom cull. Mike France was parachuted in as managing director. ELC's problem was that it had diversified away from its core toys market into clothing and nursery products. France has shut stores, replaced senior managers and made big changes to the products. Sales are now growing by nearly 10 per cent. Sources close to the company say that within 12 months, it will be either sold or floated out of Menzies. Toys 'R' Us With world sales of $12 billion and 1,500 shops in 25 countries, Toys 'R' Us is the big daddy of child's play. It has just floated off its Japanese business and completed a $1bn buy-back of its own shares. It arrived in the UK in the Eighties, selling from characterless warehouses akin to B&amp;Q superstores.",

Indeed, he was so disarmingly un-arty when describing his piece, Oak Tree, that he might have been auditioning for Changing Rooms: 'Frankly, it's a perfectly ordinary glass of water on a plain bathroom shelf. And anybody can have a work of art, too.' </p> <p>'But,' interjected his interrogator, 'if this cropped up in museums all around the world... ?' </p> <p>'Well, of course they'd be fakes!' Cue the viral laugh, which spread through its host, out of the TV and into the rest of the world, completely reducing this viewer to a giggly sofa-blob. </p> <p>Tate Modern, of course, has one of Craig-Martin's sanctioned 'fakes', though, according to the artist: 'There is only one Oak Tree. It belongs to the National Gallery of Australia.' In the week that Damien Hirst settled a copyright infringement claim against his sculpture, Hymn, out of court (the \u00a31-million, 20 foot-bronze is a scale copy of Humbrol's Young Scientist Anatomy Set, \u00a314.99 at all good toy shops), surely B&amp;Q will be straight on the blower to Craig-Martin: 'Er, we couldn't help noticing that your work, Oak Tree, is in fact currently on special offer for \u00a314.99 at our branches nationwide, subject to availability.' </p> <p>Practically everybody who was visited by this week's House Invaders and appeared on Carol Vorderman's Better Homes and Changing Rooms also had (or wanted) a nice little Craig-Martin of their own. But they also made the mistake of situating it in the bathroom, above the basin and underneath the mirror, not to mention cluttering it up with tubes of Colgate and Bonjela. As at the Tate, your fake Oak Tree can make a major statement only if placed pointlessly very high up on a plain white wall (no Anaglypta, dados or picture-rails, thank you) and accessed by stepladder. </p> <p>In last Thursday's <strong> House Invaders</strong> (a regular daytime treat featuring punters who, though perhaps not telegenic enough to appear on Changing Rooms, still get a makeover from a cheery TV decorator), Linda Barker conceptualised some very nice, modernist-looking shelves from the seats of old chairs, dotting them over the walls of an ugly Edwardian terrace in Leicester where one of the inhabitants was a former art student, though this obviously wasn't enough to make Linda's shelves 'art'. </p> <p>Interestingly, however, 24 years after Carl Andre's infamous bricks first littered the floor of the 'old' Tate and invited the derision of the tabloids, Monday's House Invader subjects, Sharon and Mitch from Yardley in Birmingham, were quite comfortable with Anna Ryder-Richardson recycling breeze blocks as candleholders and putting them on their bedside tables. 'Though I might paint the breeze blocks cream,' mused Sharon, diplomatically, after Anna had left. </p> <p>Sharon and Mitch had a pet snake called Rot, while the next day's subjects, Stephanie and Derek, also from Birmingham, had a pair of rats. Funnily enough, Jake and Dinos Chapman have a tarantula and though I don't know if it has a name, it lives in 'Hell' - which is not in the Midlands but, according to Jake, is 'a 1:32 scale reproduction of the McDonald's drive-thru just up the road from our studio', replete with plastic miniatures eating tiny headburgers 'mooning' through the windows and 'begging' on the street outside. </p> <p>Aside from the giant spider crawling over the roof, this was indeed 'hell' - all those little plastic people would be potentially lethal anywhere near children under five, so if Tate Modern buys it, they should get Anna Ryder-Richardson in to design a big toybox of brightly-coloured MDF the better to keep 'Hell' away from tiny, prying hands. It worked a treat for keeping Sharon and Mitch's living- room tidy: toys at one end, snake in the middle, sofa at the other. Sorted. </p> <p>In <strong> House Doctor</strong> (the best programme on Channel 5), Californian home stylist Anne Maurice (Gucci sunglasses, brisk, no-nonsense charm) went to Chester to try and help Mr and Mrs Renshaw sell their spacious Victorian home. The house was hell, if not 'Hell', and the cultural chasm yawned hilari ously. The Renshaws (divorced, mannered, mildly bonkers, an 'Is there honey still for tea?' parody of Englishness) needed all the help they could get from Ann, who diplomatically persuaded Mrs R to pack up her vast collection of Franklin Mint-cum-car-boot sale bird objets and store it elsewhere. </p> <p>'Oh, the owls! You're dealing with the owl family just now, aren't you?' exclaimed Mrs R, just before Ann moved on to the seabirds. Which was shortly before Mrs R (nothing as vulgar as first names for the Renshaws) unexpectedly exited the programme, waving from the back of a taxi. I so wanted to know what she made of the seagrass carpet and painted floorboards in an attic which was just crying out for a Chapman brothers makeover, having caused one prospective buyer to shiver and remark that: 'There's no way I'd allow any living creature up here.' </p> <p>Meanwhile, in a particularly delightful <strong> Changing Rooms</strong>, Laurence Llewellyn-Bowen allowed the caravan-dwelling proprietor of a Cumbrian bird-of-prey centre to keep his wooden swan sculpture in exchange for some kinetic (ie the walls moved, the floor rocked. It was, after all, inescapably a caravan) designer minimalism. While creating soft furnishings on a scale of which Claus Oldenberg would approve, Laurence sewed his cuffs to some fabric and asked for 'approximate parameters in a completely hypothetical scenario - how are we getting on with the curtains?' I doubt Jake Chapman could have put it better himself - and though the result was lovely, unfortunately the caravan's ceiling wasn't nearly high enough for a Craig Martin Oak Tree, so they probably had to settle for a shelf in the bathroom.</p>",

The Renshaws (divorced, mannered, mildly bonkers, an 'Is there honey still for tea?' parody of Englishness) needed all the help they could get from Ann, who diplomatically persuaded Mrs R to pack up her vast collection of Franklin Mint-cum-car-boot sale bird objets and store it elsewhere. 'Oh, the owls! You're dealing with the owl family just now, aren't you?' exclaimed Mrs R, just before Ann moved on to the seabirds. Which was shortly before Mrs R (nothing as vulgar as first names for the Renshaws) unexpectedly exited the programme, waving from the back of a taxi. I so wanted to know what she made of the seagrass carpet and painted floorboards in an attic which was just crying out for a Chapman brothers makeover, having caused one prospective buyer to shiver and remark that: 'There's no way I'd allow any living creature up here.' Meanwhile, in a particularly delightful Changing Rooms, Laurence Llewellyn-Bowen allowed the caravan-dwelling proprietor of a Cumbrian bird-of-prey centre to keep his wooden swan sculpture in exchange for some kinetic (ie the walls moved, the floor rocked. It was, after all, inescapably a caravan) designer minimalism. While creating soft furnishings on a scale of which Claus Oldenberg would approve, Laurence sewed his cuffs to some fabric and asked for 'approximate parameters in a completely hypothetical scenario - how are we getting on with the curtains?' I doubt Jake Chapman could have put it better himself - and though the result was lovely, unfortunately the caravan's ceiling wasn't nearly high enough for a Craig Martin Oak Tree, so they probably had to settle for a shelf in the bathroom.",

Many agree that Ecstasy is a welcome return to form, raising Reed's creative stock back up a few notches after a rather dirgey mid-Nineties. The album's songs are classic Reed with a twist.

Reed sings sexy, druggy songs, such as 'Ecstasy', licking and lapping at the microphone like a refugee from a porn movie. He thrashes through more populist ditties such as 'Romeo And Juliet' with a 'catch this' smirk. He makes snide remarks ('Of course, people from London would know all about what it's like to come from a small town'). He wriggles his non-existent bottom at us, grinning like a deranged monkey. In short, Lou Reed is every bit as great as he obviously considers himself to be. </p> <p>As a young music fan, I felt umbilically linked to the Velvets' 'Banana' album, and the solo classic, Transformer, to the point where Reed was more important to me than all four Beatles combined.

When it's <strong> One Day in September</strong>. Kevin Macdonald, weaving together old film and contemporary interviews, has turned the murder of 11 Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics into a gripping, dismaying narrative. The single surviving Black September terrorist tells his own story at last. The relatives of the slain remember with poignancy. There's a definitive investigative thrust as the real, hapless role of the German government is laid bare. This is a sizzling documentary, but it still doesn't quite fit the big screen. So much of the footage is familiar TV dross and Colemanballs that the imagery, too, is debased, somehow pining for its front parlour home. </p> <p>What matters isn't vague denunciation of an unfeeling Olympic Committee (which didn't stop the Games quickly enough) or human grief in an Israeli graveyard: what matters is Macdonald's vivid reconstruction of Bonn's botched airport rescue - a malign masterpiece of Murphy's Law. Anything that could go wrong went ludicrously, tragically wrong. The final nine hostages died in vain. Amateurism beyond words, compounded a few weeks later by a sly pantomime of renewed hostage-taking which saw the three remaining Palestinian terrorists handed over to Libya. That's the essential tale, and for completeness it needs the context of a greater awareness; it needs to acknowledge more generously that Willy Brandt's Germany, in its unpreparedness, was essentially seeking to exorcise the ghosts of its own past, another victim not a villain. More, it needs to reflect on the role of the media whose hectic reporting shaped so much - including Macdon ald's possibilities. That would have been a television expos\u00e9 to make Panorama proud again. A formidably trenchant non-movie. </p> <p>Susan Lynch is formidable, too, and the hype about her was right. She is the eponymous <strong> Nora</strong>, the hotel maid from Galway who became James Joyce's life support system, and she's wonderful: spiky and soft, chilly and warm, tragic and hilarious, always lit by genuine fire. Your eyes follow wherever she goes: which is, alas, just as well, for this is a performance in a wax museum. </p> <p>Brenda Maddox's original biography of Nora Barnacle was distinguished because her words and Joyce's flowed together, a cross-referencing and explanation of genius. Here there are no words to remember - apart from much effing and Jaysus-ing - and Ewan McGregor's supposed genius is as dull as Dublin ditchwater, a petulant bore in silly glasses who not even this adoring Nora could truly love. That's fatal, and Pat Murphy, plodding from one setpiece to another as though turning the pages of a colour supplement, is powerless to compensate. What's going wrong with McGregor, in dire need of a charisma transplant? It isn't the roles that are thrust upon him: he is co-producer of this dud. He thrust, nay impaled, himself. </p> <p>There is, as ever, good teen stuff - and the other kind. <strong> Final Destination</strong> comes roaring out of the top drawer. James Wong, the director, is an old X Files hand with a Mulderesque scenario to explore. Forty high-school kids are off to Paris for a field trip when, strapping into the runway jumbo, one of them (Devon Sawa) has a mighty premonition of doom. He and six others get off the plane. Doom explodes in the night sky: and the question is whether the Grim Reaper, thwarted of his predestined haul, will return to finish off the fortuitously saved seven.

The jolts keep coming until the last second with wholly professional zest. </p> <p>So to the duffer stuff. Freddie Prinze Junior ( She's All That ) and Julia Stiles ( 10 Things I Hate About You ) are the reigning Cary Grant and Grace Kelly of teen movies and, given a plot with an edge to it, both likeable enough.

      "body": "<p>On the campus of Santa Monica College in Los Angeles, suntanned students loiter on the grass. From a transistor radio, you can hear an advert for a plastic surgery deal to make you look like the celebrity of your choice. And, lounging incongruously on the grass amid all this low-cal Californian swagger, is one pale Englishman - David Gray. </p> <p>Gray is at the college to perform a live set of songs from his album, White Ladder . Right now, everything is going swimmingly: his show at the El Rey theatre has sold out, he's on the David Letterman show next week and the album is selling 6,000 copies a week across the States. In the UK, his album has been rereleased by EastWest to a chorus of critical acclaim and the new single, 'Babylon', is playlisted on every major pop radio station. But it wasn't always thus. The story of David Gray's rise is a refreshing, inspiring one, of the power of good songwriting to triumph over the cynical machinations of the music industry. </p> <p>Not so long ago, Gray's career seemed dead in the water. The brief approbation mustered by his 1993 debut album, A Century Ends, was long since faded, and the release of his fourth, White Ladder, passed pretty much unnoticed. Out of desperation, he toured Ireland, playing places remote enough to experience power cuts when the local dairy's milking machines turned themselves on. Slowly, the country grew to love him and the album went to number one. </p> <p>The organic Irish success of White Ladder has made Gray the 'priority act' at EastWest, above the likes of the Corrs and Busta Rhymes. As Gray says: 'They'll soon be stuffing me down everyone's throat.'

      "bodyText": "On the campus of Santa Monica College in Los Angeles, suntanned students loiter on the grass. From a transistor radio, you can hear an advert for a plastic surgery deal to make you look like the celebrity of your choice. And, lounging incongruously on the grass amid all this low-cal Californian swagger, is one pale Englishman - David Gray. Gray is at the college to perform a live set of songs from his album, White Ladder . Right now, everything is going swimmingly: his show at the El Rey theatre has sold out, he's on the David Letterman show next week and the album is selling 6,000 copies a week across the States. In the UK, his album has been rereleased by EastWest to a chorus of critical acclaim and the new single, 'Babylon', is playlisted on every major pop radio station. But it wasn't always thus. The story of David Gray's rise is a refreshing, inspiring one, of the power of good songwriting to triumph over the cynical machinations of the music industry. Not so long ago, Gray's career seemed dead in the water. The brief approbation mustered by his 1993 debut album, A Century Ends, was long since faded, and the release of his fourth, White Ladder, passed pretty much unnoticed. Out of desperation, he toured Ireland, playing places remote enough to experience power cuts when the local dairy's milking machines turned themselves on. Slowly, the country grew to love him and the album went to number one. The organic Irish success of White Ladder has made Gray the 'priority act' at EastWest, above the likes of the Corrs and Busta Rhymes. As Gray says: 'They'll soon be stuffing me down everyone's throat.' Well, at least his music - influenced by early Dylan and Van Morrison - is a lot more palatable than most of the teen-pop and novelty dance tracks record companies stuff down our throats. Gray's rough ride through the industry has taught him how to deliver his natural passion in a more generally accessible way.

      "body": "<p>Mny of the fanfares at Cannes are for films that don't exist yet - and probably never will. In 1984, planes were flying over the bay trailing banners advertising Michael Winner's remake of Gunga Din, which has still to come forth. This year, there are ads for Elian: the Gonzales Boy Story, a Menahem Golan production 'shooting now on a secret location, delivery September'. </p> <p>A more likely film for which drums have literally been beating is Bu\u00f1uel and King Solomon's Tables. A band of Spanish drummers from Bu\u00f1uel's birthplace, Calenda, paraded along the Croisette to mark both the director's centenary and the Carlos Saura biopic shortly to go into production. </p> <p>The real films in competition have an odd geographical spread - six from South-east Asia, three from Sweden, two with Israeli directors, one from former Warsaw Pact countries, one from Latin America, none from Africa or Australia. </p> <p>And they invite us to ignore their quality and experience their length. Of the 23 pictures up for the Palme d'Or, only seven are under 110 minutes. Ten are more than two hours and five are more than two-and-a-half. It would take from nine in the morning until 9.15 at night, without an interval, to watch Taiwanese Yi Yi, the French Les Destin\u00e9es Sentimentales, the Japanese Eureka and the Chinese Devils on the Doorstep back to back. There's a lack of focus here. </p> <p>Brevity, however, is not necessarily the soul of wit. Among the shortest pictures was the risible Gohatto (Taboo), Nagisa Oshima's first film since 1986, in which a flirtatious, 18-year-old, gay samurai creates sexual havoc among the imperial bodyguard of the 1860s. Someone suggested that the movie should have been called 'Ugetsu Homogatari', and it could put back the case for gays in the military for decades. </p> <p>But one of the most impressive pictures on view, Blackboards, was both the shortest and the work of the youngest director ever to have had a movie in competition - Samira Makhmalbaf, 20. Her first film, The Apple, was chosen for the Un Certain Regard section two years ago. This lean fable about itinerant schoolteachers in a desolate area of Iran near the Iraqi border is a confident advance on that promising debut. It opens with a memorable image of nine teachers carrying blackboards on their backs along a dusty mountain road, looking like prehistoric birds or Lynn Chadwick sculptures. </p> <p>Two of them break away, one joining a party of boys carrying contraband goods across the border, the other attaching himself to a horde of elderly men and one young widow with a child heading for their homeland in Iraqi Kurdistan. Everyone is too busy or wary to want to learn reading, writing and arithmetic, and the blackboards are variously used for splints, shelter and camouflage. This astonishing film is unlikely to go unrewarded; the Special Jury Prize seems a possibility. </p> <p>The jury, presided over by the French director Luc Besson, a specialist in large-scale international productions, is clearly charged with making up for the embarrassingly foolish prizes handed out last year by a jury under the eccentric Canadian provincial, David Cronenberg. The 1999 Palme d'Or, the Grand Jury Prize and the best actor and actress awards went to a pair of dedicatedly uncommercial movies, one of them stiltedly amateur, featuring wooden, unprofessional actors, while some distinguished pictures, including Raul Ruiz's, Time Regained , were ignored. </p> <p>Yet as the festival approached its final days, no consensus over front runners had emerged, though French critics were pressing the suit of Edward Yang. His three-hour Yi Yi looks at a troubled, but by no means dysfunctional, middle-class Taiwanese family, their friends, relatives and neighbours, as they cope with everyday problems at the office, at school, in the home, and within their hearts, minds and consciences. </p> <p>Three films the jury will be taking seriously are black comedies that suddenly erupt into truly disturbing violence. My favourite among these is by a little-known Frenchman, Dominik Moll. Harry: He Is Here to Help You begins with a chance encounter one hot summer's day in a motorway lavatory between two old school acquaintances, the wealthy playboy Harry (Sergi L\u00f3pez) and an underachieving language teacher Michael (Laurent Lucas), who is driving his wife and two small daughters in their battered car to a modest holiday home in the country. </p> <p>The over-solicitous Harry, convinced that Michael has not fulfilled his teenage promise as a writer, insinuates himself into the teacher's life. But the trouble with Harry is that he is a homicidal psychopath, and what starts out like a Michael Frayn comedy subtly modulates into a reworking of Hitchcock's Strangers on a Train . </p> <p>The second black comedy, Nurse Betty, sees Neil LaBute, hitherto known as writer-director of the misogynistic chamber piece, In The Company of Men, spreading his wings. In his road movie, a pair of jokey hit men (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock as father and son) pursue a dim housewife (Ren\u00e9e Zellweger) across America to acquire a cache of heroin hidden in her car. </p> <p>They have killed her car-dealing husband (Aaron Eckhardt) in a peculiarly horrendous way, first scalping him, then shooting him as he runs around like a headless chicken. Much of the humour in Nurse Betty derives from the traumatised Zellweger believing she is a nurse in her favourite soap opera, which she happens to be watching at the moment her husband is slain. </p> <p>The third black comedy, Jiang Wen's three-hour Devils on the Doorstep , turns on a group of peasants forced by Kuomintang guerrillas to hide two prisoners-of-war - a Japanese sergeant and a Chinese collaborator - in Japanese-occupied China in the last months of the Second World War. </p> <p>The film looks a treat (the five-month shooting schedule exhausted Kodak's entire stock of black-and-white film), but the joke gets a little thin by the time the naive villagers exchange their prisoners for a cartload or two of Japanese grain. Then suddenly, on the eve of VJ Day, there is a massacre, followed by a bloody execution. Can you imagine a final, feature-length episode of Allo! Allo! that concludes with Ren\u00e9's village being razed by the Germans and then Ren\u00e9 being guillotined by returning Gaullists for taking revenge on SS prisoners? That is what Devils on the Doorstep is like. </p> <p>The four best competition films from established European and American film-makers have towering literary figures behind them. The unfashionable team of producer Ismail Merchant, director James Ivory and writer Ruth Prawer Jhabvala are represented at Cannes by The Golden Bowl, their third Henry James adaptation and their best picture since Remains of the Day. It is an exquisitely designed and photographed film, many compositions resembling paintings by John Singer Sargent. </p> <p>It stars Nick Nolte and Kate Beckinsale as an American business tycoon and his innocent daughter who marry respectively an impecunious young American (Uma Thurman) and a penniless Italian prince (Jeremy Northam), a pair of ex-lovers who secretly resume their affair in Edwardian London. It is a better picture than Jane Campion's Portrait of a Lady and less determinedly modern in tone than Iain Softley's Wings of the Dove. </p> <p>The former Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma editor, Olivier Assayas, draws on less familiar literary material - Les Destin\u00e9es Sentimentales, a celebrated novel of the 1930s by Jacques Chardonne. The author came from a wealthy Protestant family, one half of which was engaged in producing cognac in the Charente, the other half manufacturing porcelain in Limoges. </p> <p>The film's central character, Jean Bannery (Charles Berling), is a priest in Charente who leaves his wife and parish to find idyllic happiness in Switzerland with a cognac merchant's niece (Emmanuelle B\u00e9art). But nagged by his Protestant conscience and sense of duty, Jean takes over the family porcelain factory in Limoges and sees it through the critical changing times of the First World War, competition from cheap foreign producers and the Depression. This stately, quietly intelligent study of responsibility and married love is rich in social detail and features two potentially prize-winning performances. </p> <p>The best female performance I have seen is that of Lena Endre as a Swedish stage star whose marriage to a conductor is destroyed by her affair with an emotionally erratic director in Liv Ullmann's Faithless. The literary figure behind this is August Strindberg whose portrait hangs on the otherwise bare walls of the workroom of an elderly writer-director called Bergman. </p> <p>Bergman has written the screenplay and we watch him conjuring up people from his past, turning them into autonomous characters, and trying to come to terms with his younger self. It is a gripping movie. </p> <p>The grandest of sources informs the Coen brothers' slight, irresistible O Brother, Where Art Thou? , set in a burnt-out Deep South summer of the 1930s and inspired by Homer's Odyssey and Preston Sturges's 1941 picture, Sullivan's Travels . Looking like a cross between Clark Gable and Henry Fonda, George Clooney plays Everett Ulysses McGill, a petty criminal who escapes from a Mississippi chain gang with two other convicts, and meets a blind poet, a Cyclops and a trio of sirens while making his way home to his wife, Penny. </p> <p>In Sullivan's Travels, a celebrated comedy director goes on the road to gather material for a social-conscience film to be called 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?' and ends up on a chain gang before deciding he should stick to making audiences laugh. The Coen brothers' lighthearted picture is the one he might have made from experience. </p> <p>The most ridiculous picture in competition is Lars Von Trier's Dancer in the Dark, a humourless musical set in the US, filmed on Swedish locations and starring Bj\u00f6rk as a half-blind Czech immigrant saving money for her son's eye operation and being framed for murdering a cop. </p> <p>The songs are terrible, the choreography a joke, the performances lamentable. Seemingly inspired by Pennies From Heaven, it finishes up like Springtime For Hitler. Some observers think it might appeal to Luc Besson. </p> <p>\u0095 Philip French was one of 20 international critics presented last week with La M\u00e9daille du Festival Cannes 2000 in recognition of his services over the years to the festival and to world cinema.</p>",

Her first film, The Apple, was chosen for the Un Certain Regard section two years ago. This lean fable about itinerant schoolteachers in a desolate area of Iran near the Iraqi border is a confident advance on that promising debut. It opens with a memorable image of nine teachers carrying blackboards on their backs along a dusty mountain road, looking like prehistoric birds or Lynn Chadwick sculptures. Two of them break away, one joining a party of boys carrying contraband goods across the border, the other attaching himself to a horde of elderly men and one young widow with a child heading for their homeland in Iraqi Kurdistan. Everyone is too busy or wary to want to learn reading, writing and arithmetic, and the blackboards are variously used for splints, shelter and camouflage. This astonishing film is unlikely to go unrewarded; the Special Jury Prize seems a possibility. The jury, presided over by the French director Luc Besson, a specialist in large-scale international productions, is clearly charged with making up for the embarrassingly foolish prizes handed out last year by a jury under the eccentric Canadian provincial, David Cronenberg. The 1999 Palme d'Or, the Grand Jury Prize and the best actor and actress awards went to a pair of dedicatedly uncommercial movies, one of them stiltedly amateur, featuring wooden, unprofessional actors, while some distinguished pictures, including Raul Ruiz's, Time Regained , were ignored. Yet as the festival approached its final days, no consensus over front runners had emerged, though French critics were pressing the suit of Edward Yang. His three-hour Yi Yi looks at a troubled, but by no means dysfunctional, middle-class Taiwanese family, their friends, relatives and neighbours, as they cope with everyday problems at the office, at school, in the home, and within their hearts, minds and consciences. Three films the jury will be taking seriously are black comedies that suddenly erupt into truly disturbing violence. My favourite among these is by a little-known Frenchman, Dominik Moll. Harry: He Is Here to Help You begins with a chance encounter one hot summer's day in a motorway lavatory between two old school acquaintances, the wealthy playboy Harry (Sergi L\u00f3pez) and an underachieving language teacher Michael (Laurent Lucas), who is driving his wife and two small daughters in their battered car to a modest holiday home in the country. The over-solicitous Harry, convinced that Michael has not fulfilled his teenage promise as a writer, insinuates himself into the teacher's life. But the trouble with Harry is that he is a homicidal psychopath, and what starts out like a Michael Frayn comedy subtly modulates into a reworking of Hitchcock's Strangers on a Train . The second black comedy, Nurse Betty, sees Neil LaBute, hitherto known as writer-director of the misogynistic chamber piece, In The Company of Men, spreading his wings. In his road movie, a pair of jokey hit men (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock as father and son) pursue a dim housewife (Ren\u00e9e Zellweger) across America to acquire a cache of heroin hidden in her car. They have killed her car-dealing husband (Aaron Eckhardt) in a peculiarly horrendous way, first scalping him, then shooting him as he runs around like a headless chicken. Much of the humour in Nurse Betty derives from the traumatised Zellweger believing she is a nurse in her favourite soap opera, which she happens to be watching at the moment her husband is slain. The third black comedy, Jiang Wen's three-hour Devils on the Doorstep , turns on a group of peasants forced by Kuomintang guerrillas to hide two prisoners-of-war - a Japanese sergeant and a Chinese collaborator - in Japanese-occupied China in the last months of the Second World War. The film looks a treat (the five-month shooting schedule exhausted Kodak's entire stock of black-and-white film), but the joke gets a little thin by the time the naive villagers exchange their prisoners for a cartload or two of Japanese grain. Then suddenly, on the eve of VJ Day, there is a massacre, followed by a bloody execution. Can you imagine a final, feature-length episode of Allo! Allo! that concludes with Ren\u00e9's village being razed by the Germans and then Ren\u00e9 being guillotined by returning Gaullists for taking revenge on SS prisoners? That is what Devils on the Doorstep is like. The four best competition films from established European and American film-makers have towering literary figures behind them. The unfashionable team of producer Ismail Merchant, director James Ivory and writer Ruth Prawer Jhabvala are represented at Cannes by The Golden Bowl, their third Henry James adaptation and their best picture since Remains of the Day. It is an exquisitely designed and photographed film, many compositions resembling paintings by John Singer Sargent. It stars Nick Nolte and Kate Beckinsale as an American business tycoon and his innocent daughter who marry respectively an impecunious young American (Uma Thurman) and a penniless Italian prince (Jeremy Northam), a pair of ex-lovers who secretly resume their affair in Edwardian London. It is a better picture than Jane Campion's Portrait of a Lady and less determinedly modern in tone than Iain Softley's Wings of the Dove. The former Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma editor, Olivier Assayas, draws on less familiar literary material - Les Destin\u00e9es Sentimentales, a celebrated novel of the 1930s by Jacques Chardonne. The author came from a wealthy Protestant family, one half of which was engaged in producing cognac in the Charente, the other half manufacturing porcelain in Limoges. The film's central character, Jean Bannery (Charles Berling), is a priest in Charente who leaves his wife and parish to find idyllic happiness in Switzerland with a cognac merchant's niece (Emmanuelle B\u00e9art). But nagged by his Protestant conscience and sense of duty, Jean takes over the family porcelain factory in Limoges and sees it through the critical changing times of the First World War, competition from cheap foreign producers and the Depression. This stately, quietly intelligent study of responsibility and married love is rich in social detail and features two potentially prize-winning performances. The best female performance I have seen is that of Lena Endre as a Swedish stage star whose marriage to a conductor is destroyed by her affair with an emotionally erratic director in Liv Ullmann's Faithless. The literary figure behind this is August Strindberg whose portrait hangs on the otherwise bare walls of the workroom of an elderly writer-director called Bergman. Bergman has written the screenplay and we watch him conjuring up people from his past, turning them into autonomous characters, and trying to come to terms with his younger self. It is a gripping movie. The grandest of sources informs the Coen brothers' slight, irresistible O Brother, Where Art Thou? , set in a burnt-out Deep South summer of the 1930s and inspired by Homer's Odyssey and Preston Sturges's 1941 picture, Sullivan's Travels . Looking like a cross between Clark Gable and Henry Fonda, George Clooney plays Everett Ulysses McGill, a petty criminal who escapes from a Mississippi chain gang with two other convicts, and meets a blind poet, a Cyclops and a trio of sirens while making his way home to his wife, Penny. In Sullivan's Travels, a celebrated comedy director goes on the road to gather material for a social-conscience film to be called 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?' and ends up on a chain gang before deciding he should stick to making audiences laugh. The Coen brothers' lighthearted picture is the one he might have made from experience. The most ridiculous picture in competition is Lars Von Trier's Dancer in the Dark, a humourless musical set in the US, filmed on Swedish locations and starring Bj\u00f6rk as a half-blind Czech immigrant saving money for her son's eye operation and being framed for murdering a cop. The songs are terrible, the choreography a joke, the performances lamentable. Seemingly inspired by Pennies From Heaven, it finishes up like Springtime For Hitler. Some observers think it might appeal to Luc Besson. \u0095 Philip French was one of 20 international critics presented last week with La M\u00e9daille du Festival Cannes 2000 in recognition of his services over the years to the festival and to world cinema.",

The 53rd Cannes Film Festival kicked off not under the piercing blue skies typical of the Riviera in May, but under slate-grey clouds and drenched in drizzle. After a few days the clement weather returned but the slight air of tetchiness and disappointment was harder to dispel. </p> <p>It was a mood not relieved by a slate of films generally perceived to be only just north of drab, and a continuing battle between party organisers and the local mayor, who was determined to rain on the parade. Traditionally some of the best and well attended bashes have taken place on the hotel beaches that line the Croisette. But this year Mayor Maurice DeLauney imposed a curfew. </p> <p>A showdown was inevitable and it arrived with MTV's attempt to ignore the party-pooping politician and dance on. In a stand-off between French local politics and US cultural imperialism the victor was a foregone conclusion, and the gendarmes waded in like angry parents and pulled the plug, leading to scuffles and a general worsening of industry/community relations. It wasn't the Mayor's only unpopular decision. Plans to land a seaplane and stage a Spitfire flypast to promote a forthcoming movie adaptation of Biggles were rejected as 'too noisy' while scantily clad models were barred from parading along the Croisette. </p> <p>Celebrity turnout was poor, with the Americans still running scared after the risible reception given to Armageddon two years ago. George Clooney, in town to promote the Coen Brothers' Oh Brother Where Art Thou?, was the only really big draw and delighted tourists and locals by signing autographs and having holiday snaps taken. </p> <p>At the other extreme Tommy Lee Jones chewed up and spat out the journalists unlucky enough to have had to interview him ('That man terrifies me,' whimpered one ashen-faced hack on exiting the star's cabana).

      "bodyText": "Maybe it was the weather that did for it. The 53rd Cannes Film Festival kicked off not under the piercing blue skies typical of the Riviera in May, but under slate-grey clouds and drenched in drizzle. After a few days the clement weather returned but the slight air of tetchiness and disappointment was harder to dispel. It was a mood not relieved by a slate of films generally perceived to be only just north of drab, and a continuing battle between party organisers and the local mayor, who was determined to rain on the parade. Traditionally some of the best and well attended bashes have taken place on the hotel beaches that line the Croisette. But this year Mayor Maurice DeLauney imposed a curfew. A showdown was inevitable and it arrived with MTV's attempt to ignore the party-pooping politician and dance on. In a stand-off between French local politics and US cultural imperialism the victor was a foregone conclusion, and the gendarmes waded in like angry parents and pulled the plug, leading to scuffles and a general worsening of industry/community relations. It wasn't the Mayor's only unpopular decision. Plans to land a seaplane and stage a Spitfire flypast to promote a forthcoming movie adaptation of Biggles were rejected as 'too noisy' while scantily clad models were barred from parading along the Croisette. Celebrity turnout was poor, with the Americans still running scared after the risible reception given to Armageddon two years ago. George Clooney, in town to promote the Coen Brothers' Oh Brother Where Art Thou?, was the only really big draw and delighted tourists and locals by signing autographs and having holiday snaps taken. At the other extreme Tommy Lee Jones chewed up and spat out the journalists unlucky enough to have had to interview him ('That man terrifies me,' whimpered one ashen-faced hack on exiting the star's cabana). Gene Hackman made a fleeting appearance while Gregory Peck arrived with three generations of his family in tow to promote the documentary A Conversation With Gregory Peck. Uma Thurman, Calista Flockhart and Renee Zellweger also showed up for photocalls. Less impressive was Michael 'Lord Of The Dance' Flatley who announced to whoever would listen to him: 'I may not become a great actor but I've definitely got the makings of a movie star.' Makings, it seems, that include more than a measure of self-confidence. Brian De Palma did nothing to dispel his famously grumpy reputation at a press conference for the universally panned blockbuster Mission To Mars. Bj\u00f6rk, in town to promote the Lars Von Trier film Dancer In The Dark, allegedly had a spat with her director and failed to turn up at her press conference. It has also been the first festival to have a distinctly dotcom air, with a plethora of new media firms touting their wares. One of the most prominent, Atomfilms, failed to do itself any favours by hosting a party beset by the unforgivable gaffe of allowing the booze to run out.

      "body": "<p>At 19, Shawn Fanning has a number one haircut, a half-finished degree in computer studies, and is being sued by his favourite band, Metallica. These three facts all contribute to the rather complicated mess Fanning's got himself into, and explain how a nerdy Boston college kid ended up a paper multi-millionaire, an international youth icon, and the centre of a legal storm that will ultimately decide the nature of the music industry's future. </p> <p>Metallica are suing the company Fanning helped found, Napster Inc, for copyright infringement. This is because of a free piece of software written by Fanning called 'the Napster'. It's simple to download from the Net and makes it easy, for the first time, to get your hands on high-quality copies of chart music for free. Metallica, first among a list of disapproving major artists that includes Elton John, Sean 'Puffy' Combs and Dr Dre, don't like the loss of record sales that this might mean. Conversely, a host of million-selling bands including The Smashing Pumpkins, Hole, The Offspring, Cypress Hill and Limp Bizkit have come out in support of the freedom the Napster grants. A war of words and writs has erupted. And the haircut? Well, that explains how the ridiculous word 'napster' came to be on the lips of media lawyers and music pundits worldwide. </p> <p>'I was playing basketball with a friend,' begins Fanning, sat on the sunny terrace of an Italian restaurant in the Silicon Valley satellite town of San Mateo. 'We were talking trash back and forth, and at that time my hair was growing out a little bit. He said I had \"nappy\" hair, because when it grows, it gets all curly. I got really mad at him, so he kept saying it just to piss me off.' Fanning is still sensitive about his hair and takes off his baseball cap to illustrate the next key point. 'Even though I kept my hair very short,' he says, stroking his head as if to remind himself just how much shorter he keeps it now, 'pretty soon it turned into a nickname.' </p> <p>And so Fanning became the 'Napster'. At first, it was simply the log-on he used when discussing hacking in Internet chat rooms. Now it's in the top 10 most sought-after items on Internet search engines, and a recent survey found that 73 per cent of US students have used it, with more than half using it weekly. What happened between these two events may mark one of the biggest revolutions in music since man first took ecstasy. </p> <p>What Napster does is find small MP3 files on the Internet. These are copies of digital quality music taken straight from CDs and left online for anyone to download and play on their computer. MP3s have been the bane of music copyrighters for a few years, but they were hard to find, and often didn't work when you got them. Napster has changed all that. It creates a directory of the best MP3s on the Net and leads you straight to them. The Napster has transformed the MP3 from a tech-head pastime into one of the prime social activities of US college life with the potential to explode internationally. And so the music industry has panicked. </p> <p>Last week a black van arrived at Napster Inc's offices, and dumped 13 boxes of paperwork on its doorstep. These represented the theatrical next stage in a lawsuit from Metallica, who had asked Napster to remove their songs from its directory, saying they were violating the band's copyright. Napster said it would remove the people from the list who were trading the songs, only if Metallica named them individually. So Metallica did just that - and 300,000 names were promptly blacklisted. </p> <p>'I was defensive of the band when they first filed the suit,' says Fanning. 'I thought perhaps this was industry propaganda and some lawyer capitalising on the controversy - not explaining things to Metallica fully. I got very defensive as I like the music and the band members. Lars Ulrich [drummer and songwriter] has said it's not about money, but control.' Fanning is referring to the fact that many of the songs traded on Napster are demo versions or incomplete songs. Ulrich wants to control who hears what - and when. He says Napster is 'looting our art'. </p> <p>Napster has several suits against it. One is from the powerful Record Industry Association Of America. In November last year, it announced a suit for 'contributory copyright infringement' because it had noticed that most of the files on Napster were 'purloined'. Dr Dre followed Metallica by handing his list of user names last week to Napster via e-mail. Elton John slammed the lack of 'respect and compensation for creative work' that Napster showed, saying it was 'wrong to promote stealing from artists online'. Sean 'Puffy' Combs said: 'Every artist Napster abuses deserves respect.' </p> <p>If the RIAA get its way, Napster could be liable for $100,000 damages for each copyright infringement. The total bill could be a sum large enough to bankrupt Bill Gates: Fanning has made powerful enemies. He has his fans, too. 'One of the artists who has publicly come out to support us is Billy Corgan of the Smashing Pumpkins. It's pretty amazing. I'm a big fan and to hear him actually explain how music will evolve online, how this is a good thing for the artist, and present a strong articulate argument - that makes me feel really good,' he says, slurping a Pepsi Max through a straw. </p> <p>Fanning only got his first computer four years ago. In those years he has had one failed business - an Internet security firm he describes as 'a joke'- and written a piece of software that has catapulted him to the forefront of the intellectual property debate. He now has a small office in San Mateo, where his room - the nerve centre in a firm of 35 - smells of the banana skins that fill the bin and is adorned by a copy of Rolling Stone magazine, propped upright on his desk, with Britney Spears on the cover. </p> <p>Napster began in 1998 when Fanning was at North West University in Boston. His roommate had an appetite for obscure rap music that he was feed ing with MP3s. Fanning soon picked up on his friend's frustration with MP3s and started work at his uncle's offices on something that might help. With the support of his tutors, he worked obsessively on building the computer code, fearing another company would steal the idea before he had completed it. 'I cut myself off. If I was working on something that took two or three days to implement then I would not sleep for two or three days. I got my energy from the feedback I was getting on chat rooms - and from caffeine.' </p> <p>The program was released on the Net in January, and Napster soon needed more equipment to meet the demand. Fanning's uncle, John, incorporated the company this month. Since then Fanning has worked flat out. 'I don't have time to party, and if I do I'm afraid I'll lose self-control. Any efforts to establish a relationship with a girl would be pointless as I'm not sleeping much.' </p> <p>He looks deep into the next glass of Pepsi as he continues coyly. 'It would be nice to have someone to... er, you know... get your mind off of work. But I want to make sure the company is in a great position before I start having fun. It's a huge opportunity because we're really popular in all these schools and it's really tempting to go and party. But I have this fear that if I get caught up it will all fall apart. Maybe I'm overestimating my importance.' </p> <p>Howard King, lawyer for Metallica and Dr Dre, would not agree. 'This is the fastest-growing site ever,' King says. 'They could raise hundreds of millions of dollars if they decided to offer shares in the company. But the asset of the company is stolen music. There are colleges across the States - where the Napster is particularly popular - whose record stores are going out of business. When we win this case we will put them [Napster] out of business.' </p> <p>I ask Fanning how he deals with the idea that Napster facilitates the theft of an artist's music. 'I really can't discuss that ,' he says, momentarily distracted by a passing girl. 'It has too many legal implications.' How does he feel about the high stakes of the case? What if he loses? 'It's been a good experience. I've worked as hard as I can, and can't be disappointed. I'm getting burnt out on the whole software development thing. I'm thinking of going back to school. Hanging out, chilling.' </p> <p>Even if Napster loses, Fanning will have achieved something. 'It's a monumental development,' says Andy Greenwald, online editor of Spin magazine. 'The music industry hyperventilated when home-taping surfaced, but Napster is bigger in its scope. Its very nature - the trading of one song at a time - will place an emphasis on singles. In colleges one song tends to make a hot list, sweep the campus, and then be replaced by another the next week. The most positive thing it that it shows absolute passion in music.' As an LA Times editorial said, Napster is, 'in its purest form, hard-core Sixties: free love, free music'. </p> <p>Back in Fanning's office, an e-mail has just arrived about a possible front cover of Time magazine. It brings home the scale of what Napster has done and irreversibly will do. And this is something of which Fanning seems both magically and alarmingly unaware. </p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<b> The Turn of the Screw</b> New Theatre, Cardiff <p><b> Radamisto </b> Grand Theatre, Leeds </p> <p>Freud is still a writer to be reckoned with. His essay on 'The Uncanny' (1919) deals with man's primitive attitude to death. 'Most likely our fear,' he writes, 'still implies the old belief that the dead man becomes the enemy of his survivor and seeks to carry him off to share his new life with him.' This is as neat a summary as one will find of the anxieties that charge <b> The Turn of the Screw</b>. </p> <p>In Henry James's novella, a governess struggles to determine whether the children in her care are in the grip of two ghosts - Peter Quint and Miss Jessel - or whether it is she herself who is in their demonic thrall. </p> <p>James may have written his cryptic tale two decades earlier, but he was fully immersed in the bubbling brew of late nineteenth-century opinion on matters parapsychological out of which Freud would soon emerge. After all, his brother, the philosopher William James, who coined the phrase 'stream of consciousness', argued forcefully for the mutual dependence of the visible and the spiritual world and the powers of the unseen to affect the seen. </p> <p>Such questions are the crux of The Turn of the Screw . By the time Britten and his librettist, Myfanwy Piper, worked it into an opera in 1954, the tale's ambiguities were now compounded by accretions of a post-Freudian kind, muddied yet further by the composer's own neuroses and his obsessions with haunted isolation and lost innocence. </p> <p>WNO's penetrating new production by John Crowley, his first in a burgeoning theatrical career, puts such quandaries firmly in perspective. His primary concern is with making good theatre rather than with providing answers to these endlessly fascinating questions. Whereas Deborah Warner's stunning production for the Royal Opera House underlined the sense of collective evil, Crowley's approach is, or gives a clever impression of being, hands-off. Either reading is viable. Britten's miraculous score makes of the strong, slim structure of Piper's text its own elusive play of light and shadow, here wonderfully captured in Paul Pyant's flickeringly atmospheric lighting. </p> <p>The characters in this strong cast interact with cool austerity and, in the children's case, normal if innocuous mischief. While Warner's governess was hyper-nervy and credibly evil (a memorable Joan Rodgers), Janice Watson here plays her as strikingly impassive, barely smiling at her new charges when she first meets them, her anxieties (mirrored in jittery violin writing) all internalised. Even at the moment of crisis, she retains a vestige of self-control, thus blurring the borders of madness and sanity and giving us the option of believing in her innate goodness. </p> <p>Crowley and his designer, Rob Howell, whose ingenious movable platform manages to suggest a range of places from tower to lake, have observed Britten's wish that the interludes between scenes should be marked simply by darkness and gauzes. This would have been even more effective were not the ambient light in Cardiff's New Theatre quite so bright. </p> <p>Nevertheless, this was a gripping evening, with Paul Nilon a mesmerisingly aloof yet full-blooded Quint and Geraldine McGreevy's Miss Jessel disturbingly friendly (and bearing an uncanny resemblance to the governess; is this her future too?). Gregory Monk, aged 12, had the perfect combination of knowing innocence as Miles, with Yvette Bonner a primly charming Flora. WNO's chamber ensemble showed verve and bite under the baton of Carlo Rizzi (whose imminent departure as the company's musical director has recently been announced). </p> <p>Finally, praise to the compiler of the programme book, always a strong point at WNO, done without fuss. To publish here for the first time the letters of the first Miles, David Hemmings, to Britten was a real coup. </p> <p>The current craze for Handel operas, redressing two- and-a-half centuries of neglect, has gone too far. I confess to Handel fatigue and now peer gingerly at each new opera schedule to see how many lurk there. </p> <p><b> Radamisto</b>, his 1720 opera for London, is a brave choice for any non-specialist opera house. This long, unsmiling work, despite many sizzling numbers, shows the composer at his most solemn. For audiences unused to the noble gestures and high-mindedness of baroque opera seria , it makes a tough evening and one short on jokes. </p> <p>Moreover, for Handel purists, the clumsy, if well-intentioned attempts of directors to offer a way into this highly stylised art form almost guarantees an air of first-night gloom (not helped on this occasion by several technical mishaps); those keenest to hear it are most visibly and volubly disappointed. Tim Hopkins, though he tried valiantly to create a modern idiom to cope with the difficulties, hadn't entirely found a solution. He is hardly the first. At least the manic activity which has dogged so many recent ENO Handel productions was avoided. </p> <p>Too much was replaced by not enough. Asia Minor circa AD51, in Charles Edwards's designs, has become a vorticist no-man's-land of aggressive bold lines and sharp angles (with some modish, square-cut costumes). </p> <p>A room within the set, all wonky lines and false perspective, gave the characters an unfortunate oversized appearance of having fallen down the rabbit hole and eaten Alice's small cake.

      "bodyText": "The Turn of the Screw New Theatre, Cardiff Radamisto Grand Theatre, Leeds Freud is still a writer to be reckoned with. His essay on 'The Uncanny' (1919) deals with man's primitive attitude to death. 'Most likely our fear,' he writes, 'still implies the old belief that the dead man becomes the enemy of his survivor and seeks to carry him off to share his new life with him.' This is as neat a summary as one will find of the anxieties that charge The Turn of the Screw. In Henry James's novella, a governess struggles to determine whether the children in her care are in the grip of two ghosts - Peter Quint and Miss Jessel - or whether it is she herself who is in their demonic thrall. James may have written his cryptic tale two decades earlier, but he was fully immersed in the bubbling brew of late nineteenth-century opinion on matters parapsychological out of which Freud would soon emerge. After all, his brother, the philosopher William James, who coined the phrase 'stream of consciousness', argued forcefully for the mutual dependence of the visible and the spiritual world and the powers of the unseen to affect the seen. Such questions are the crux of The Turn of the Screw . By the time Britten and his librettist, Myfanwy Piper, worked it into an opera in 1954, the tale's ambiguities were now compounded by accretions of a post-Freudian kind, muddied yet further by the composer's own neuroses and his obsessions with haunted isolation and lost innocence. WNO's penetrating new production by John Crowley, his first in a burgeoning theatrical career, puts such quandaries firmly in perspective. His primary concern is with making good theatre rather than with providing answers to these endlessly fascinating questions. Whereas Deborah Warner's stunning production for the Royal Opera House underlined the sense of collective evil, Crowley's approach is, or gives a clever impression of being, hands-off. Either reading is viable. Britten's miraculous score makes of the strong, slim structure of Piper's text its own elusive play of light and shadow, here wonderfully captured in Paul Pyant's flickeringly atmospheric lighting. The characters in this strong cast interact with cool austerity and, in the children's case, normal if innocuous mischief. While Warner's governess was hyper-nervy and credibly evil (a memorable Joan Rodgers), Janice Watson here plays her as strikingly impassive, barely smiling at her new charges when she first meets them, her anxieties (mirrored in jittery violin writing) all internalised. Even at the moment of crisis, she retains a vestige of self-control, thus blurring the borders of madness and sanity and giving us the option of believing in her innate goodness. Crowley and his designer, Rob Howell, whose ingenious movable platform manages to suggest a range of places from tower to lake, have observed Britten's wish that the interludes between scenes should be marked simply by darkness and gauzes. This would have been even more effective were not the ambient light in Cardiff's New Theatre quite so bright. Nevertheless, this was a gripping evening, with Paul Nilon a mesmerisingly aloof yet full-blooded Quint and Geraldine McGreevy's Miss Jessel disturbingly friendly (and bearing an uncanny resemblance to the governess; is this her future too?). Gregory Monk, aged 12, had the perfect combination of knowing innocence as Miles, with Yvette Bonner a primly charming Flora. WNO's chamber ensemble showed verve and bite under the baton of Carlo Rizzi (whose imminent departure as the company's musical director has recently been announced). Finally, praise to the compiler of the programme book, always a strong point at WNO, done without fuss. To publish here for the first time the letters of the first Miles, David Hemmings, to Britten was a real coup. The current craze for Handel operas, redressing two- and-a-half centuries of neglect, has gone too far. I confess to Handel fatigue and now peer gingerly at each new opera schedule to see how many lurk there. Radamisto, his 1720 opera for London, is a brave choice for any non-specialist opera house. This long, unsmiling work, despite many sizzling numbers, shows the composer at his most solemn. For audiences unused to the noble gestures and high-mindedness of baroque opera seria , it makes a tough evening and one short on jokes. Moreover, for Handel purists, the clumsy, if well-intentioned attempts of directors to offer a way into this highly stylised art form almost guarantees an air of first-night gloom (not helped on this occasion by several technical mishaps); those keenest to hear it are most visibly and volubly disappointed. Tim Hopkins, though he tried valiantly to create a modern idiom to cope with the difficulties, hadn't entirely found a solution. He is hardly the first. At least the manic activity which has dogged so many recent ENO Handel productions was avoided. Too much was replaced by not enough. Asia Minor circa AD51, in Charles Edwards's designs, has become a vorticist no-man's-land of aggressive bold lines and sharp angles (with some modish, square-cut costumes). A room within the set, all wonky lines and false perspective, gave the characters an unfortunate oversized appearance of having fallen down the rabbit hole and eaten Alice's small cake. But the futurist connection was reasonable, and pointed up the ugly violence of the plot, a story taken from Tacitus, whose complexities nearly defy pr\u00e9cis but which include the standard ingredients of secret passion, revenge and redemption. Musical standards were high. Harry Bicket, conducting, drew clean, muscular playing from the English Northern Philharmonia. All the women were good, especially Alice Coote and Emma Bell. Yet, however grand the score - and Handel's invariably are - three-and-a-half hours is too long to watch almost nothing happening.",

      "body": "<p>Imagine an author embarking on her second major novel, about a Polish actress who emigrates to America. Plot is charted, characters sketched, when the plans for writing are thrown off track. First by war: our writer spends the best part of three years in, or else immersed in the cause of, the besieged Bosnian capital Sarajevo - where you are never out of range, where The End lurks over your shoulder day and night. The war over, she returns to New York and to her book, only to be injured in a car crash, 13 bones fractured. They take months to mend, during which time it is almost impossible to write, but eventually our author resumes work on her book. </p> <p>Before long, however, doctors diagnose cancer. Unable to write while taking morphine for crippling pain, she is again obliged to shelve the project. Finally, the disease is driven into remission and she returns to writing. </p> <p>There are many authors who might by now have adapted their subject matter to something more obviously self-centred, but the original themes of this novel, published in the UK next month, remain unchanged. In America - completed in two years but over an eight-year period - is still the book about an emigrant Polish actress called Maryna Zalezowska. </p> <p>Not only that, of course; it is the story of one rather magnificent woman's waltz with time and place, between her public and private lives, between men - and above all with her adoptive America. It is about her discovery of the country which embraced the author's own family from Poland two generations ago, at a time when, she writes, 'history is roaring by, turning itself into geography; open land as far as the mind can see'. A country where a woman can say: 'I have set my heart against the past. America is good for that.' </p> <p>Susan Sontag walks the little streets of New York's Chinatown under fire escapes that cascade down the sides of buildings. A warm springtime breeze blows through the badger-like streak of silver hair that makes her so immediately distinctive. Delicacies tumble out of shops on to the sidewalk; Sontag stops and chooses two boxes of duck eggs. This is her favourite quarter of town, which makes subliminal sense: her father, a silk merchant, died while on business in China. </p> <p>Sontag is excited that a Taiwanese fast-food chain is opening a branch here, selling 'delicious, gummy fruit drinks'. As we walk, she explains why her new book is not about her remarkable decade just past. 'I prefer to live my life,' she says, 'and write about other things. There are writers for whom all experience is material, so that all they really do in the world is write. But there are things I want to do in the world that I can't or don't want to write. I have to be able to stop and pat a child on the head without wondering how it is going to fit into a book.' </p> <p>Both real-life Sontag and Sontag in books seem to be around every corner. At one point, life had me commuting between Naples and Bosnia; between the Vesuvian city where Sontag set (and I therefore had to read) her first major novel, The Volcano Lover - about Emma Hamilton's affair with Lord Nelson - and Sarajevo, where Sontag was then directing a production of Waiting for Godot under shellfire. Coming to America to set my own heart against the past, I chance upon her or her books with gratifying regularity and almost always by coincidence. And now we're in Chinatown, where she wants to ensure a taste of the best exotic ice cream (her favourite flavour is coconut but the ginger turns out to be even better). </p> <p>Sontag is ageless in as much as she is a literary grande dame whose work has none the less grown youthful - from the austere asceticism of earlier essays to the often playful sensuality of The Volcano Lover and now In America , whose heroines she both resembles and does not. She is like that Bob Dylan line: 'I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now.' 'Then' was an 'older' past which seemed to bypass childhood and adolescence. </p> <p>Sontag was born in New York in 1933. She fell in love with Shostakovich, Bart\u00f3k and the Partisan Review as a teenager in Los Angeles. She went to Chicago University aged 15, 'loved being a student', and after two years married sociology lecturer Philip Rieff who surfaces in the new novel as a character called Casaubon. The two trophies Sontag carried away from the marriage of nine years were, in order of importance, her son David and the distinction of being the only woman in Californian history to refuse alimony. For a while she lived astride Paris and New York, before settling in the latter. </p> <p>She loves the city she still lives in, and no wonder: her apartment above the meatpacking district has views in every direction of the most audacious urban project mankind has ever undertaken. The interior is lined with what must amount to a mile of books, organised so that Goethe is in the room where she recently installed a piano (having begun lessons at the age of 66); Giotto in the corridor and Umberto Eco next to the kitchen. But, she says, 'the thing that is most American in me' has nothing to do with New York. It is to do with 'a love of self-reinvention, the idea that you can become another person, change your life, be reborn. It's very European to think that you can never escape your past.' </p> <p>This is over dim sum in a place where they know little or no English but know Susan Sontag as well as she knows their shrimp rolls. There is another American quality, in contrast to Europe, which she describes in her book: 'In America, you are expected to exhibit the confusions of inner vehemence... and have eccentric foibles and extravagant needs which exhibit the force of your will, your appetitiveness, the spread of your self-regard - all excellent things.' In other words, to splurge your complex and lusty private life all over the place. </p> <p>Sontag does not really think this is all 'excellent', since there is one place her conversation will not go. She and Annie Liebovitz have become a New York institution, usually out in each other's company, and the database files are brimful with attempts by interviewers trying to find out more. We all have to use the same phrase: 'reticent about her private life'. One can infer whatever one wants to, but anyone privy to the truth probably wouldn't write it anyway. There are a variety of celebrated women who command a singular and protective loyalty around them, whose friends are like the military wing of a political organisation - women like Hillary Clinton, Joan Baez and, without doubt, Susan Sontag. </p> <p>Perhaps logically, then, Sontag once wrote an essay called 'Against Interpretation', as much manifesto for herself as Kantian text. Although a philosopher, she does not like talking in interpretive abstracts about what she calls 'the result of experiences about which I don't think much. I'm interested in the experience, not in any particular moral meaning to experience. I don't worry about life after death, only life before death.' A life for which she has often feared, not least in Bosnia. </p> <p>'I went to Sarajevo,' she says at lunch, 'initially out of some attachment to Europe. What was happening in Rwanda was far worse than Bosnia, but I found it unbelievable that in modern Europe there could be genocide and death camps 50 years after the end of the Second World War. I went as a self-appointed volunteer to do whatever people wanted me to do. They happened to want me to do theatre. I didn't want to go as a writer or for any reason to do with wickedness or goodness. I'm a very restless person and I have a high tolerance for discomfort. Most people prefer to be comfortable, but I think comfort isolates. It means they're not going to know much about the world are they? And when discomfort or illness or even death happen, they have this idea that it's not fair.' </p> <p>Like all of us who were in Bosnia, she adds: 'And if you have never seen a war at first hand, then you've missed out on a very important aspect of human experience and existence.' For Sontag, however, war was not the only 'discomfort'. </p> <p>Cancer still enjoys a primitive, medieval aura in modern society - people talk about the disease as though it were one of the four riders of the Apocalypse rather than something treatable and beatable. So if - as happened to me 18 months ago - doctors find something they do not like the look of, once again one needs to locate Sontag, this time in an essay of 1978 called 'Illness as Metaphor'. </p> <p>In the seventies, Sontag was diagnosed with breast cancer and, against her doctor's advice, went to France for chemotherapy. It worked; the cancer was beaten back. Sontag, however, was not content to beat just the disease. She went on to rail against a language written by such favourites as Baudelaire (as well as the Nazis) which equates disease with social decay and vice-versa. Sontag's essay liberated 'patients' (she reminds us of the etymological origins of the word) from the stigmas around cancer, and from the idiotic but stubborn notion that 'the cure can be worse than the disease'. </p> <p>By the time 'Illness as Metaphor' was published, another disease was coming to share with cancer the burden of stigma and melodramatic language, and Sontag wrote a kind of supplement to her cancer essay, a compassionate and passionate document entitled 'Aids and Its Metaphors'. Next time you find someone with either disease, cock your head to one side to inspect the spines of their books and if they do not own these essays, buy them a copy. </p> <p>Then came Sontag's second, recent, need to defy cancer once again. She recalls it as she does Sarajevo, with her indelible humanism and few judgements to make. 'It was part of the journey. I would never describe cancer as a \"learning experience\" and I don't know how to use the word \"solace\". You have to mobilise what resources you have, and you are with other people. You have very intense experiences with people who are ill and around you. In the chemo room at the hospital, it isn't just me - there's someone over there who is vomiting, someone there talking to her husband. It is reality - and you know, it is so easy to shut out reality. I want to take in as much reality as I can.' </p> <p>In her new novel, Sontag describes Maryna Zalezowska and her husband as 'people of active conscience', which is a good description of her too. For underpinning her world of people is that of politics, in which Sontag is irrevocably involved, be it out of contempt for her mayor, Rudy Giuliani, or in reflection upon the left-wing ideology that propelled her youth. </p> <p>Earlier this year, cultural New York was captivated by the figure of Dmitri Shostakovich. The Emerson Quartet performed a cycle of string quartets and the Metropolitan Opera staged Lady Macbeth of Mtensk, about lust, murder and the oppression of womanhood. All this meant bumping into Sontag once again. The cycle was for me a culmination of decades of interest in the composer, and at every single performance the audience was spliced by that dash of silver hair, always accompanied by the towering figure of Annie Liebovitz. </p> <p>Sontag calls Shostakovich 'the real thing, as artist and politically'. Like him and the American Left of her own generation, Sontag felt the presence of Marxism but was appalled by its expressions. She was a vociferous opponent of the Vietnam War and embargo against Cuba, but was later captivated by the spectacle of real revolution - spawned in her family home of Poland - on the streets of our own lifetime which pitched the people not against capitalism but against communism. Eastern Europe's uprising was a very Sontag-ish meeting between personal and political - a political movement, indeed, based upon getting politics out of people's lives. </p> <p>There was a famous meeting at New York Town Hall in 1992, during the Soviet-backed crackdown on the Solidarnosc movement at which she told a crowd of leftists eager to jump on the Polish union's coat-tails that she thought the pages of the conservative Readers Digest had portrayed communism more accurately than those of the left-wing Nation . She called the Soviet bloc 'fascism with a human face'. Now Sontag says she 'would not use the word \"socialism\" in any shape or form. In fact I don't really know what it means.' But the wheel has turned and it is time again to worry about capitalism. </p> <p>'I am astounded and depressed at how the logic of capitalism has become so imperial. There's so little motivating people in America other than making money - I was talking to a friend from Canada who said that her people were not as interested as here in making it, as though that was a problem. I think it is better to try and find other satisfactions... No, I don't think the revolutions in Eastern Europe were motivated by wanting this. They were motivated by a strong idea of bourgeois civil liberties, and power to them!' </p> <p> Sontag's insatiable interests and infectious enthusiasms seem to know no frontier. Despite her concern over hyper-capitalism, she is enthralled by computers: 'Like it or not, they are here to stay.' And by cyberlife, even cybersex. 'A friend of mine is a heterosexual,' she says, 'has a cyberlife as a gay man, exchanging fantasies with gay men - if that is what they really are! And I wonder what the limits of such relationships are - is it, for instance, permissible to get jealous?' </p> <p>We're now back at the apartment and her assistants have just set up the software for a new machine. Sontag insists on a CD matinee show - A Bug's Life . She loves the high-definition on screen. 'Have you seen Toy Story 2 ? she asks. 'Oh you should. I went one afternoon, the place full of kids - marvellous movie.' Then we go back to talking about Shostakovich. </p> <p>\u0095 Susan Sontag will be in conversation with Hermione Lee at Waterstone's, Piccadilly, London W1 on 31 May at 7pm, tickets \u00a35.

I have to be able to stop and pat a child on the head without wondering how it is going to fit into a book.' Both real-life Sontag and Sontag in books seem to be around every corner. At one point, life had me commuting between Naples and Bosnia; between the Vesuvian city where Sontag set (and I therefore had to read) her first major novel, The Volcano Lover - about Emma Hamilton's affair with Lord Nelson - and Sarajevo, where Sontag was then directing a production of Waiting for Godot under shellfire. Coming to America to set my own heart against the past, I chance upon her or her books with gratifying regularity and almost always by coincidence. And now we're in Chinatown, where she wants to ensure a taste of the best exotic ice cream (her favourite flavour is coconut but the ginger turns out to be even better). Sontag is ageless in as much as she is a literary grande dame whose work has none the less grown youthful - from the austere asceticism of earlier essays to the often playful sensuality of The Volcano Lover and now In America , whose heroines she both resembles and does not. She is like that Bob Dylan line: 'I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now.' 'Then' was an 'older' past which seemed to bypass childhood and adolescence. Sontag was born in New York in 1933. She fell in love with Shostakovich, Bart\u00f3k and the Partisan Review as a teenager in Los Angeles. She went to Chicago University aged 15, 'loved being a student', and after two years married sociology lecturer Philip Rieff who surfaces in the new novel as a character called Casaubon. The two trophies Sontag carried away from the marriage of nine years were, in order of importance, her son David and the distinction of being the only woman in Californian history to refuse alimony. For a while she lived astride Paris and New York, before settling in the latter. She loves the city she still lives in, and no wonder: her apartment above the meatpacking district has views in every direction of the most audacious urban project mankind has ever undertaken. The interior is lined with what must amount to a mile of books, organised so that Goethe is in the room where she recently installed a piano (having begun lessons at the age of 66); Giotto in the corridor and Umberto Eco next to the kitchen. But, she says, 'the thing that is most American in me' has nothing to do with New York. It is to do with 'a love of self-reinvention, the idea that you can become another person, change your life, be reborn. It's very European to think that you can never escape your past.' This is over dim sum in a place where they know little or no English but know Susan Sontag as well as she knows their shrimp rolls. There is another American quality, in contrast to Europe, which she describes in her book: 'In America, you are expected to exhibit the confusions of inner vehemence... and have eccentric foibles and extravagant needs which exhibit the force of your will, your appetitiveness, the spread of your self-regard - all excellent things.' In other words, to splurge your complex and lusty private life all over the place. Sontag does not really think this is all 'excellent', since there is one place her conversation will not go. She and Annie Liebovitz have become a New York institution, usually out in each other's company, and the database files are brimful with attempts by interviewers trying to find out more. We all have to use the same phrase: 'reticent about her private life'. One can infer whatever one wants to, but anyone privy to the truth probably wouldn't write it anyway. There are a variety of celebrated women who command a singular and protective loyalty around them, whose friends are like the military wing of a political organisation - women like Hillary Clinton, Joan Baez and, without doubt, Susan Sontag. Perhaps logically, then, Sontag once wrote an essay called 'Against Interpretation', as much manifesto for herself as Kantian text. Although a philosopher, she does not like talking in interpretive abstracts about what she calls 'the result of experiences about which I don't think much. I'm interested in the experience, not in any particular moral meaning to experience. I don't worry about life after death, only life before death.' A life for which she has often feared, not least in Bosnia. 'I went to Sarajevo,' she says at lunch, 'initially out of some attachment to Europe. What was happening in Rwanda was far worse than Bosnia, but I found it unbelievable that in modern Europe there could be genocide and death camps 50 years after the end of the Second World War. I went as a self-appointed volunteer to do whatever people wanted me to do. They happened to want me to do theatre. I didn't want to go as a writer or for any reason to do with wickedness or goodness. I'm a very restless person and I have a high tolerance for discomfort. Most people prefer to be comfortable, but I think comfort isolates. It means they're not going to know much about the world are they? And when discomfort or illness or even death happen, they have this idea that it's not fair.' Like all of us who were in Bosnia, she adds: 'And if you have never seen a war at first hand, then you've missed out on a very important aspect of human experience and existence.' For Sontag, however, war was not the only 'discomfort'. Cancer still enjoys a primitive, medieval aura in modern society - people talk about the disease as though it were one of the four riders of the Apocalypse rather than something treatable and beatable. So if - as happened to me 18 months ago - doctors find something they do not like the look of, once again one needs to locate Sontag, this time in an essay of 1978 called 'Illness as Metaphor'. In the seventies, Sontag was diagnosed with breast cancer and, against her doctor's advice, went to France for chemotherapy. It worked; the cancer was beaten back. Sontag, however, was not content to beat just the disease. She went on to rail against a language written by such favourites as Baudelaire (as well as the Nazis) which equates disease with social decay and vice-versa. Sontag's essay liberated 'patients' (she reminds us of the etymological origins of the word) from the stigmas around cancer, and from the idiotic but stubborn notion that 'the cure can be worse than the disease'. By the time 'Illness as Metaphor' was published, another disease was coming to share with cancer the burden of stigma and melodramatic language, and Sontag wrote a kind of supplement to her cancer essay, a compassionate and passionate document entitled 'Aids and Its Metaphors'. Next time you find someone with either disease, cock your head to one side to inspect the spines of their books and if they do not own these essays, buy them a copy. Then came Sontag's second, recent, need to defy cancer once again. She recalls it as she does Sarajevo, with her indelible humanism and few judgements to make. 'It was part of the journey. I would never describe cancer as a \"learning experience\" and I don't know how to use the word \"solace\". You have to mobilise what resources you have, and you are with other people. You have very intense experiences with people who are ill and around you. In the chemo room at the hospital, it isn't just me - there's someone over there who is vomiting, someone there talking to her husband. It is reality - and you know, it is so easy to shut out reality. I want to take in as much reality as I can.' In her new novel, Sontag describes Maryna Zalezowska and her husband as 'people of active conscience', which is a good description of her too. For underpinning her world of people is that of politics, in which Sontag is irrevocably involved, be it out of contempt for her mayor, Rudy Giuliani, or in reflection upon the left-wing ideology that propelled her youth. Earlier this year, cultural New York was captivated by the figure of Dmitri Shostakovich. The Emerson Quartet performed a cycle of string quartets and the Metropolitan Opera staged Lady Macbeth of Mtensk, about lust, murder and the oppression of womanhood. All this meant bumping into Sontag once again. The cycle was for me a culmination of decades of interest in the composer, and at every single performance the audience was spliced by that dash of silver hair, always accompanied by the towering figure of Annie Liebovitz. Sontag calls Shostakovich 'the real thing, as artist and politically'. Like him and the American Left of her own generation, Sontag felt the presence of Marxism but was appalled by its expressions. She was a vociferous opponent of the Vietnam War and embargo against Cuba, but was later captivated by the spectacle of real revolution - spawned in her family home of Poland - on the streets of our own lifetime which pitched the people not against capitalism but against communism. Eastern Europe's uprising was a very Sontag-ish meeting between personal and political - a political movement, indeed, based upon getting politics out of people's lives. There was a famous meeting at New York Town Hall in 1992, during the Soviet-backed crackdown on the Solidarnosc movement at which she told a crowd of leftists eager to jump on the Polish union's coat-tails that she thought the pages of the conservative Readers Digest had portrayed communism more accurately than those of the left-wing Nation . She called the Soviet bloc 'fascism with a human face'. Now Sontag says she 'would not use the word \"socialism\" in any shape or form. In fact I don't really know what it means.' But the wheel has turned and it is time again to worry about capitalism. 'I am astounded and depressed at how the logic of capitalism has become so imperial. There's so little motivating people in America other than making money - I was talking to a friend from Canada who said that her people were not as interested as here in making it, as though that was a problem. I think it is better to try and find other satisfactions... No, I don't think the revolutions in Eastern Europe were motivated by wanting this. They were motivated by a strong idea of bourgeois civil liberties, and power to them!' Sontag's insatiable interests and infectious enthusiasms seem to know no frontier. Despite her concern over hyper-capitalism, she is enthralled by computers: 'Like it or not, they are here to stay.' And by cyberlife, even cybersex. 'A friend of mine is a heterosexual,' she says, 'has a cyberlife as a gay man, exchanging fantasies with gay men - if that is what they really are! And I wonder what the limits of such relationships are - is it, for instance, permissible to get jealous?' We're now back at the apartment and her assistants have just set up the software for a new machine. Sontag insists on a CD matinee show - A Bug's Life . She loves the high-definition on screen. 'Have you seen Toy Story 2 ? she asks. 'Oh you should. I went one afternoon, the place full of kids - marvellous movie.' Then we go back to talking about Shostakovich. \u0095 Susan Sontag will be in conversation with Hermione Lee at Waterstone's, Piccadilly, London W1 on 31 May at 7pm, tickets \u00a35.

      "body": "<p>Is th penalty a metaphor for the indecision of modern life or simply an easy way of scoring a goal? I think it's safe to assume that this question was not in the forefront of David Batty's mind when he walked up to take his ill-conceived penalty against Argentina in the 1998 World Cup. Certainly, there was nothing in the stoic demeanour of the Yorkshireman to suggest that he viewed that penalty shoot-out as anything but a penalty shoot-out. Whatever it meant to Batty, it wasn't a workshop on existential doubt. </p> <p>The obvious answer to why Batty missed is that Carlos Roa, the Argentinian goalkeeper, saved his shot. The man himself, I imagine, would appreciate that sort of blunt logic. To reduce the penalty to this simple exchange, however, is to miss something vital, aside from the goal. </p> <p>The appeal of the penalty lies ostensibly in its orchestrated suspense. We know something is going to happen but we don't know what it will be. For this reason, some critics have found the penalty shoot-out a contrived drama, an absurd ordeal. One sportswriter compared it to bad art. No doubt there is an element of melodrama in shoot-outs, especially when they are truly gripping, but it is rarely cheap melodrama, if only because failure comes at such a price. </p> <p>I would go so far as to say that the shoot-out is as near perfect an allegory of the human condition as sport offers. Of course, the field is rich in experiential metaphors, with all the triumphs and disasters, winners and losers, and countless other stupefying clich\u00e9s that make up the world of competitive games. The beauty of the penalty, though, is that it powerfully represents the fear and the hope, and the regret or relief, that are compressed into the meaningful junctures of life. For a brief period, the game stops and the penalty-taker enters his own chamber of truth, a place where actions have ineluctable consequences. The penalty shoot-out goes even further. In its combination of individual choice and collective responsibility, it attains an almost moral significance. </p> <p>The metaphysics of the penalty were first explored by Peter Handke. His novel, Die Angst des Tormanns beim Elfmeter or The Goalie's Anxiety at the Penalty Kick, was published in 1970, the year that penalty shoot-outs were introduced to an indifferent world. Fittingly, it was a German film director, Wim Wenders, who took up the idea in his 1971 adaptation of Handke's book. I say fittingly because Wenders's countrymen have excelled at the penalty's physics ever since, with one notable exception. The West German national side lost the final of the 1976 European Nations Cup in a shoot-out. Subsequently, the Germans have won four major shoot-outs, in which, put together, they have missed just one solitary penalty kick. </p> <p>Footballers have many impressive qualities - bravery, stamina, determination - but decision-making, like verbal eloquence, is seldom one of them. It's simply not something they're used to doing. The choices players make on the pitch - run or mark, shoot or pass, elbow or headbutt - are nothing more than micro-decisions, instant reactions, impulses. Real decisions, big decisions, the kind that demand or, worse, afford time and thought, are something to be taken care of by the manager, or the agent, the adviser or the wife. I mention this with all the humility and sympathy of a man who would rather find out what's on Sky Sports 3 than come to a firm decision about almost anything. </p> <p> Decision-making, if we are honest, is a mournfully oppressive business. The human spirit may crave freedom, but it recoils from choice. To commit to one option - to live with a certain person rather than another, say, or to go to this New Year's Eve party and not that one - is to confront the irreversibility of time. </p> <p>In this sense, to make a choice in life is to recognise the inevitability of death. That's why we procrastinate, or attempt to suspend the moment of decision, for as long as we can. And frequently longer if we happen to be male. </p> <p>'It's very close when you're standing there,' said Bob Wilson, the former Arsenal keeper turned TV pundit who is also the England number one David Seaman's goalkeeping coach. 'If you walk out in the cold light of day in the stadium with no one around and you put the ball on the spot and you stand facing the goal, you seriously think, well, it's impossible to miss.' </p> <p>Of the 71 penalties awarded in the FA Premiership in 1998-1999, only 50 were scored. Twenty-one, or just under 30 per cent, were apparently not impossible to miss. </p> <p>With these figures in mind, I motored out one morning to Bob's home just beyond the M25 in the mock-Tudor world of Hertfordshire. My motives for the visit were twofold: I wanted to talk to Bob about penalties, and more than that, I wanted to engage his help in setting up a mini-contest with Seaman, in which I could test my own penalty-taking abilities against arguably the world's best. I hadn't kicked a ball in anger for a couple of years and even then I was no more than an average Sunday league player. How many out of 10 would I find it impossible not to score? </p> <p>Bob, to his immense credit, immediately warmed to the idea and promised to sell it to Seaman at their next coaching session. </p> <p>As agreed, I called Bob a week after my visit. </p> <p>'No, he can't do it. Insurance.' </p> <p>'Sorry?' </p> <p>'What if you were to break his finger?' </p> <p>Of course. </p> <p>I later phoned Seaman's business agent, his wife, to see if he'd have a word with me about the art of saving penalties. She told me that he would prefer not to, because at some time in the future he planned to do his own book on penalties. In which case, I feel it is only fair that I take the opportunity right now to state, without bitterness, that I shall not be available to take penalties when he needs someone to test him. </p> <p>I'd wanted to take on Seaman for obvious reasons: because he was the England goalkeeper in the last two tournaments that ended in shoot-outs and, it appeared, he would maintain that position in the next tournament, Euro 2000. He is also a very fine penalty-saver. But not necessarily the best penalty-saver. Statistically, that award would have to go to Mark Crossley of Nottingham Forest. A 31-year-old goalkeeper who has not benefited from the most consistent good fortune in his career, Crossley has, nevertheless, enjoyed what might seem the luck only to have faced 13 penalties in the top flight - the old First Division, the Premier League and FA Cup. But the luck resides with all those players who have never had to attempt to beat him from the spot. Of his 13 penalties, he has saved eight. That's almost a 65per cent record, more than double the average of Premiership goalkeepers. </p> <p>Initially, the word from Forest was that Crossley would talk but he wouldn't stand in goal for me. I then spoke to Crossley. He was open, down-to-earth, interested and helpful. 'Well, if you can come up to the training ground,' he said. 'you can take a few pens with me.' </p> <p>This is where it all began, in Nottingham. Every schoolboy used to know that Notts County is the world's oldest club, founded in 1862. If you walk for about 10 minutes along the towpath by the River Trent you come to Nottingham Forest's training ground. I didn't take the towpath, a mistake that would cause me severe distress later on. Instead, I crossed the park from the other side and was pleased to see a figure I recognised as Mark Crossley diving about a goal not far from the perimeter fence. </p> <p>I was about to gesture towards Mark when I suddenly heard a teammate call him 'Norm'. So this wasn't Crossley? Jesus, I thought, they have another keeper who's a dead ringer. How confusing. I tried a couple of waves but received no response. Now I was in something of a quandary. Should I walk over to the other end of the pitch and look for another Crossley? What if there was no other Crossley? The training session was due to end any minute and the original Crossley might have gone by the time I made it back to him. I decided to stick with this Crossley and see what happened. He made a couple of superb saves during a five-a-side game, flying through the air and bending the ball round the post. 'Great save, Norm,' said one of the coaches. </p> <p>Looking down at the turf, I noted with alarm that it was chewed up and soft from the previous night's rain. I then looked up and noted with even greater alarm that Mark or Norm or whoever he was had gone. The session was over and the players were walking away. I slipped effortlessly and immediately into absolute panic. </p> <p>'Mark!' I shouted six or seven times, but he couldn't hear me. He was either too far away or not Mark or both. I ran round the top of the perimeter to where I thought the entrance would be. But when I got there, I came up against a barrier of razor wire. That meant I would now have to run around three sides of the vast playing fields, which were about half the size of Nottinghamshire. </p> <p>The only exercise I had endured for the previous three months was turning on the computer each morning with my middle finger. For some reason, I was also wearing two coats, as well as carrying my kitbag. </p> <p>What seemed like a month later, I was on the towpath, skidding precariously on my studs. I could see Mark or Norm a couple of hundred yards up ahead. I wanted to shout, but that would have required breath and energy. Instead, I let out a high-pitched whine. Luckily, the guy walking with Mark/Norm must have possessed the hearing of bat, because he drew his companion's attention to the disturbing noise. The goalkeeper looked momentarily baffled. Even now, I dread to imagine what thoughts flickered across his mind as he looked back at this figure with two coats, panting by the side of the river. </p> <p>Anyhow, he came back and shook my hand. It was Crossley. I learned later that Norm was a nickname given to him years ago by Stuart Pearce on account of a supposed resemblance to Norman Whiteside, the former Manchester United midfielder of celebrated hardness and legendary thirst. The name stuck. </p> <p>'Right then,' he said. 'Are you ready to do it now?' </p> <p>What I was ready for was an oxygen tent and a glucose drip. </p> <p>'Yeah,' I gasped. 'Great.' </p> <p>We returned to the training field. There was a handful of players collecting balls and messing around. Effectively, the place was empty. But as Gary Lineker once said: 'It's not about the crowd, it's about the technique.' </p> <p>As I turned to face perhaps the finest penalty-saving goalkeeper in the business, my thoughts were not entirely untroubled by doubt. This was going to be only the second spot kick I had ever taken - the first being some 27 years ago. But I needed to be positive. And, without wishing to boast, there was good cause to be positive. I had scored from that penalty three decades before. </p> <p>It wasn't just any penalty, either. Television cameras were there to record the event. In the 1972-73 season, I was playing for my class team in what was then known as the fourth year at Rhyl Street primary school in Kentish Town, north London. Actually, every boy in my class played for the team. Selection was based solely on being in my class and not a girl. Our greatest rivals - strictly speaking, our only rivals - were the team from the other class in the fourth year. We played them each morn ing before school and every lunchtime - or 'dinnertime' as we called it then. </p> <p>The games took place on what was known as a 'bomb debris site' about 100 yards from the school. Unbeknown to us, the wasteland had become the focus of a struggle between an idealistic hippie organisation which wanted to develop a community centre there and, I think, the local council, which owned the site. Anyway, Thames Television became interested and sent along a reporter and cameraman to do a story. </p> <p>When we arrived at the clearing to resume the daily contest with our implacable opponents, the media were waiting. 'Listen,' said the bloke with the camera, 'don't take any notice of us. Just play your normal game.' Our 'normal game' usually resulted in a score of, say, 13-11 or 18-14. Goals were not a problem. There was no precedent for a nil-nil draw. </p> <p>But due to our manic need to shine in front of the television camera, the match was goalless with a couple of minutes to go. No one passed the ball and whenever anyone had it everyone tried to tackle him, including his own teammates. Scoring a goal was not the point. Getting into frame was the only concern. </p> <p>And then somebody clattered into me in the penalty box. I can't remember through what powers of arbitration a penalty was awarded, only that it was. </p> <p>I wrestled the ball away from the m l\u00e9e and placed it on the spot , determined to gain what was rightfully mine; I was, after all, the one who had been fouled. My determination was born of the certain knowledge that if I scored, the penalty - the game's only goal - would be shown later that evening on television. On television, where Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United appeared. On television. In colour. </p> <p>'Keep your head down,' said a voice inside me. I ran up and cracked the thing as hard as I could. Such was my resolve to obey the injunction that I did not look up in time to be sure if the ball had gone in or not. But my success was confirmed by my classmates shouting and racing after me. I had, of course, already taken off, consumed by the glory of the moment and the adulation of the camera and the instinct to run. </p> <p>When I got home, I told everyone and we gathered round to watch the report after the six o'clock news. There was an interminable interview with some or other faceless bureaucrat, followed by an even longer one with well-meaning long hair. Cut to a three-second shot of a few indistinguishable kids - but definitely not including me - walking across the tarmac, and then back to the stiff and the freak moaning on. </p> <p>And that was it. No penalty. No goal. No television fame. At such a tender age, I had experienced the special pressures of the penalty kick and the ruthless demands of television. </p> <p>Crossley stood in the goal, a forbidding presence, although not one that appeared impassable... </p> <p>\u0095 You can find out how Andrew Anthony fares in his book, On Penalties, published this week by Yellow Jersey, \u00a310.

Of the 71 penalties awarded in the FA Premiership in 1998-1999, only 50 were scored. Twenty-one, or just under 30 per cent, were apparently not impossible to miss. With these figures in mind, I motored out one morning to Bob's home just beyond the M25 in the mock-Tudor world of Hertfordshire. My motives for the visit were twofold: I wanted to talk to Bob about penalties, and more than that, I wanted to engage his help in setting up a mini-contest with Seaman, in which I could test my own penalty-taking abilities against arguably the world's best. I hadn't kicked a ball in anger for a couple of years and even then I was no more than an average Sunday league player. How many out of 10 would I find it impossible not to score? Bob, to his immense credit, immediately warmed to the idea and promised to sell it to Seaman at their next coaching session. As agreed, I called Bob a week after my visit. 'No, he can't do it. Insurance.' 'Sorry?' 'What if you were to break his finger?' Of course. I later phoned Seaman's business agent, his wife, to see if he'd have a word with me about the art of saving penalties. She told me that he would prefer not to, because at some time in the future he planned to do his own book on penalties. In which case, I feel it is only fair that I take the opportunity right now to state, without bitterness, that I shall not be available to take penalties when he needs someone to test him. I'd wanted to take on Seaman for obvious reasons: because he was the England goalkeeper in the last two tournaments that ended in shoot-outs and, it appeared, he would maintain that position in the next tournament, Euro 2000. He is also a very fine penalty-saver. But not necessarily the best penalty-saver. Statistically, that award would have to go to Mark Crossley of Nottingham Forest. A 31-year-old goalkeeper who has not benefited from the most consistent good fortune in his career, Crossley has, nevertheless, enjoyed what might seem the luck only to have faced 13 penalties in the top flight - the old First Division, the Premier League and FA Cup. But the luck resides with all those players who have never had to attempt to beat him from the spot. Of his 13 penalties, he has saved eight. That's almost a 65per cent record, more than double the average of Premiership goalkeepers. Initially, the word from Forest was that Crossley would talk but he wouldn't stand in goal for me. I then spoke to Crossley. He was open, down-to-earth, interested and helpful. 'Well, if you can come up to the training ground,' he said. 'you can take a few pens with me.' This is where it all began, in Nottingham. Every schoolboy used to know that Notts County is the world's oldest club, founded in 1862. If you walk for about 10 minutes along the towpath by the River Trent you come to Nottingham Forest's training ground. I didn't take the towpath, a mistake that would cause me severe distress later on. Instead, I crossed the park from the other side and was pleased to see a figure I recognised as Mark Crossley diving about a goal not far from the perimeter fence. I was about to gesture towards Mark when I suddenly heard a teammate call him 'Norm'. So this wasn't Crossley? Jesus, I thought, they have another keeper who's a dead ringer. How confusing. I tried a couple of waves but received no response. Now I was in something of a quandary. Should I walk over to the other end of the pitch and look for another Crossley? What if there was no other Crossley? The training session was due to end any minute and the original Crossley might have gone by the time I made it back to him. I decided to stick with this Crossley and see what happened. He made a couple of superb saves during a five-a-side game, flying through the air and bending the ball round the post. 'Great save, Norm,' said one of the coaches. Looking down at the turf, I noted with alarm that it was chewed up and soft from the previous night's rain. I then looked up and noted with even greater alarm that Mark or Norm or whoever he was had gone. The session was over and the players were walking away. I slipped effortlessly and immediately into absolute panic. 'Mark!' I shouted six or seven times, but he couldn't hear me. He was either too far away or not Mark or both. I ran round the top of the perimeter to where I thought the entrance would be. But when I got there, I came up against a barrier of razor wire. That meant I would now have to run around three sides of the vast playing fields, which were about half the size of Nottinghamshire. The only exercise I had endured for the previous three months was turning on the computer each morning with my middle finger. For some reason, I was also wearing two coats, as well as carrying my kitbag. What seemed like a month later, I was on the towpath, skidding precariously on my studs. I could see Mark or Norm a couple of hundred yards up ahead. I wanted to shout, but that would have required breath and energy. Instead, I let out a high-pitched whine. Luckily, the guy walking with Mark/Norm must have possessed the hearing of bat, because he drew his companion's attention to the disturbing noise. The goalkeeper looked momentarily baffled. Even now, I dread to imagine what thoughts flickered across his mind as he looked back at this figure with two coats, panting by the side of the river. Anyhow, he came back and shook my hand. It was Crossley. I learned later that Norm was a nickname given to him years ago by Stuart Pearce on account of a supposed resemblance to Norman Whiteside, the former Manchester United midfielder of celebrated hardness and legendary thirst. The name stuck. 'Right then,' he said. 'Are you ready to do it now?' What I was ready for was an oxygen tent and a glucose drip. 'Yeah,' I gasped. 'Great.' We returned to the training field. There was a handful of players collecting balls and messing around. Effectively, the place was empty. But as Gary Lineker once said: 'It's not about the crowd, it's about the technique.' As I turned to face perhaps the finest penalty-saving goalkeeper in the business, my thoughts were not entirely untroubled by doubt. This was going to be only the second spot kick I had ever taken - the first being some 27 years ago. But I needed to be positive. And, without wishing to boast, there was good cause to be positive. I had scored from that penalty three decades before. It wasn't just any penalty, either. Television cameras were there to record the event. In the 1972-73 season, I was playing for my class team in what was then known as the fourth year at Rhyl Street primary school in Kentish Town, north London. Actually, every boy in my class played for the team. Selection was based solely on being in my class and not a girl. Our greatest rivals - strictly speaking, our only rivals - were the team from the other class in the fourth year. We played them each morn ing before school and every lunchtime - or 'dinnertime' as we called it then. The games took place on what was known as a 'bomb debris site' about 100 yards from the school. Unbeknown to us, the wasteland had become the focus of a struggle between an idealistic hippie organisation which wanted to develop a community centre there and, I think, the local council, which owned the site. Anyway, Thames Television became interested and sent along a reporter and cameraman to do a story. When we arrived at the clearing to resume the daily contest with our implacable opponents, the media were waiting. 'Listen,' said the bloke with the camera, 'don't take any notice of us. Just play your normal game.' Our 'normal game' usually resulted in a score of, say, 13-11 or 18-14. Goals were not a problem. There was no precedent for a nil-nil draw. But due to our manic need to shine in front of the television camera, the match was goalless with a couple of minutes to go. No one passed the ball and whenever anyone had it everyone tried to tackle him, including his own teammates. Scoring a goal was not the point. Getting into frame was the only concern. And then somebody clattered into me in the penalty box. I can't remember through what powers of arbitration a penalty was awarded, only that it was. I wrestled the ball away from the m l\u00e9e and placed it on the spot , determined to gain what was rightfully mine; I was, after all, the one who had been fouled. My determination was born of the certain knowledge that if I scored, the penalty - the game's only goal - would be shown later that evening on television. On television, where Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United appeared. On television. In colour. 'Keep your head down,' said a voice inside me. I ran up and cracked the thing as hard as I could. Such was my resolve to obey the injunction that I did not look up in time to be sure if the ball had gone in or not. But my success was confirmed by my classmates shouting and racing after me. I had, of course, already taken off, consumed by the glory of the moment and the adulation of the camera and the instinct to run. When I got home, I told everyone and we gathered round to watch the report after the six o'clock news. There was an interminable interview with some or other faceless bureaucrat, followed by an even longer one with well-meaning long hair. Cut to a three-second shot of a few indistinguishable kids - but definitely not including me - walking across the tarmac, and then back to the stiff and the freak moaning on. And that was it. No penalty. No goal. No television fame. At such a tender age, I had experienced the special pressures of the penalty kick and the ruthless demands of television. Crossley stood in the goal, a forbidding presence, although not one that appeared impassable... \u0095 You can find out how Andrew Anthony fares in his book, On Penalties, published this week by Yellow Jersey, \u00a310.

      "body": "<p>In 1976, John Wayne starred in his final film, The Shootist. The parallels between the Duke and his character, John Bernard Brooks were transparent. Brooks - like Wayne - was dying of cancer. Trying to live out his last years quietly, he can't escape his reputation as a legendary gunfighter. Don Siegel's film was a thoughtful, fond farewell to both the Duke and the western. Wayne was 69 when The Shootist was completed: the lung cancer he had had for two decades killed him three years later. </p> <p>In many ways, Unforgiven was Clint Eastwood's own The Shootist, his requiem for the West and the western. It was even dedicated to 'Sergio and Don', although the message was more revisionist and less elegiac. But while Wayne was saying goodbye to the world, if the 62-year-old Eastwood was taking leave of anything it was the cowboy movie. The very next year he was back in the box office charts, running around - a little out of breath - as a Secret Service agent in In The Line Of Fire. He wasn't about to fade out gracefully. </p> <p>In 10 days time, Clinton Eastwood Jr will turn 70. In three months time, Space Cowboys will be released in the US, starring Clint and contemporaries James Garner and Donald Sutherland - along with comparative youngster Tommy Lee Jones - as a group of astronauts hauled out of retirement. It is Clint's 56th film as an actor, and 22nd as a director. He's been a top-rank movie star for 35 years: few people - Wayne is one - have been consistently popular for as long. In a 1997 Harris poll, he was still America's favourite star. And as he's maintaining a rate of at least a film every two years, there's no reason to think that he's stopping any time soon. </p> <p>Yet in many ways it has been a strange career. Eastwood became a great star of westerns as the genre was dying. He's a man associated with very big guns who got his best reviews for a film - Unforgiven - that seemed to question Hollywood's gun culture, if not in an entirely consistent way. He's an unmistakably American character who has lived almost his whole life in California, yet had to go to Spain to an Italian movie based on a Japanese film to become a star. He's an icon of the US Right but he once said: 'I've always considered myself too individualistic to be either right-wing or left-wing.' And he's a man who at the height of his popularity, when he could have done anything he wanted, chose to make two films co-starring an orang-utan. </p> <p>He was born in San Francisco, 100 miles or so up the coast from his current home of Carmel. His parents were itinerant workers during the Depression. Clinton Jr worked as a lumberjack and in steel mills before being drafted into the army in 1951. Serving as a swimming instructor, he didn't have to go to Korea. It was his army friends who convinced him he could be an actor, and he spent the mid-Fifties doing bit parts in films such as Tarantula , Revenge Of The Creature and Lady Godiva , as well as digging swimming pools to pay the rent. Then in 1959 a CBS executive decided that Eastwood looked like a cowboy, and cast him as one of the stars of the TV series Rawhide . But while Steve McQueen - born two months before Eastwood - made a smooth transition from TV star (Wanted: Dead Or Alive) to movie star (The Magnificent Seven), Eastwood had to take a chance with an unlikely invitation to go to Europe to make a western. </p> <p>'I'd done Rawhide for about five years. The agency called and asked if I was interested in doing a western in Italy and Spain. I said, \"Not particularly.\" They said, \"Why don't you give the script a quick look?\" I was kind of curious, so I read it, and I recognised it right away as Yojimbo, a Kurosawa film I had liked a lot. Over I went, taking the poncho with me: the cape was my idea.' </p> <p>Clint Eastwood owes almost everything to Sergio Leone. It was Leone who turned him from a clean-cut American boy into the weird, mythic, amoral Man With No Name. If the Eastwood character in A Fistful Of Dollars is a reluctant good guy, helping the townsfolk because they are too stupid to help themselves, by The Good, The Bad And The Ugly he has few redeeming features at all. Even the process by which Leone worked - using a ragbag cast speaking a range of languages, which meant dialogue was kept to a minimum to keep the dubbing simple - contributed to myth-making. Leone also fetishised stares, and Clint had a great squinting stare. </p> <p>Unlike the Americans who had worked for Leone making gladiator movies, Eastwood returned home a star, and started working with his other mentor - Don Siegel. </p> <p>Dirty Harry sealed Eastwood's place as one of the biggest film stars ever. But it also made a lot of people uncomfortable with him. Pauline Kael, who in 1971 was probably as influential as any film critic has ever been, took against Eastwood for life. She considered Harry Callahan a fascist. 'There's a lot of violence at the beginning of Grand Illusion,' she wrote, 'But you're appalled by it. Bonnie and Clyde suffered for their indifference and casualness about using weapons. Whereas in a Clint Eastwood movie, you identify with the guy with the biggest gun, not the victim.' </p> <p>It is something Eastwood has been asked about many times. 'I think people jumped to conclusions about Dirty Harry without giving the character much thought, trying to attach right-wing connotations to the film that were never really intended. Both Don Siegel - who considered himself a liberal - and I thought it was a basic kind of drama: what do you do when you believe so much in law and order and coming to the rescue of people and you just have five hours to solve a case? I think it was interpreted as a pro-police point of view, as a kind of rightist heroism, at a time in American history when police officers were looked down on as \"pigs\", as very oppressive people. I'm sure there are some who are, and a lot who aren't.' </p> <p>The timing was everything: the history of cinema is full of trigger-happy, rule-breaking cops. But in the context of 1971, as the Nixon backlash against the counterculture was in full swing, Callahan was bound to be seen as a political figure. The film was set in San Francisco, after all. And a lot of Americans enjoyed Callahan's brutal but effective approach as a contrast to what they saw as the social breakdown around them. </p> <p>But Dirty Harry isn't Death Wish. One of Eastwood's biographers, Richard Schickel, has called him 'one of the great ironists of the age'. That's stretching the point too far. But Callahan is so clearly not just the normal screen cop with a wreck of a personal life, but a borderline psychopath, that the film deserves to be seen as ambiguous in its treatment of its hero. </p> <p>And while Eastwood was being vilified by the Left, John Wayne refused to work with him. 'I gave him a piece of material that I thought had potential for us to do as a younger guy and an older guy. He wrote me back critical of it. He had seen High Plains Drifter, and he didn't think that represented Americana like She Wore a Yellow Ribbon and other John Ford westerns. I never answered him.' </p> <p>The confusion over Eastwood's political role was intensified by his stint as mayor of Carmel from 1986-88. Many, including Bob Dole, thought that Eastwood was launching a real political career. But he only ran because he was infuriated by his own problems getting planning permission in the pretty but rather proudly twee California town. His politics are of a traditional American anti-government type: he doesn't like taxes, bureaucracy or lawyers. On the other hand, he's wise enough not to be a family-values bore, which would be hard with at least (there are stories of more) five children from four mothers. His first marriage produced two children, but he also had an illegitimate daughter during the same period. He had another daughter between marriages (with actress Frances Fisher). And he's got a young daughter by his present marriage. His most famous relationship - with actress Sandra Locke - still has legal repercussions 12 years after they split. </p> <p>His current wife, Dina Ruiz, is part-African American and part-Japanese. Isaiah Washington, who starred in Eastwood's recent True Crime, suggested that Ruiz might have had something to do with that film's critical look at race and justice in the US. But Eastwood, as befits a jazz obsessive, has always had a decent record on race, which fits in with his description of himself as 'a social liberal and a fiscal conservative'. Even while serving as Carmel's mayor, he kept making films. There's no doubt he works hard: those 22 films he has directed were made in 29 years, with other acting roles slotted in between. They always come in on time, and on budget. 'I loved it,' James Garner says about Eastwood's approach to directing. 'Be ready. Do it. Bam! Bam! Get out of there.' You couldn't call him a great actor. Although he said, 'I always tried to be a character actor,' he doesn't have much range. But he is a great film star, an unmistakable presence: the eyes, the voice, the walk, the one-liners. A history of cinema without Eastwood is as hard to imagine as one without Bogart or James Stewart or Marilyn Monroe. </p> <p>Is he a great director too? He's certainly made his share of bad films: Midnight In The Garden Of Good And Evil, Heartbreak Ridge, The Rookie. And he was given a little too much credit for the films that seemed to mess with the image: Unforgiven and Bird . But he has made stranger, more interesting films: White Hunter, Black Heart - which dissects the macho approach to being a film director. And Honkytonk Man, a bleak and messy film about country music during the Depression, with Clint playing an utterly unsympathetic singer dying of tuberculosis that plenty hated. The unqualified triumphs are all westerns: 1985's Pale Rider, The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976) and most of all, the spooky, funny and harsh High Plains Drifter (1972), only the second film Eastwood directed and by some way the best. </p> <p>Here's a simpler reason to admire him. Asked how he had managed to turn the sickly bestseller The Bridges Of Madison County into a half-decent film, Eastwood didn't try false modesty or attempt to defend the book. He just said, 'I took all the drivel out.' So if you do happen to see him, wish him a happy seventieth: he's earned it. </p> <p><strong>Clint, year by year</strong></p> <p><strong> 1930</strong> Born 31 May in San Francisco, son of working-class parents Ruth and Clinton Eastwood Senior </p> <p><strong> 1953</strong> Marries Maggie Johnson </p> <p><strong> 1955 </strong> Makes first film appearance as 'Jet squadron leader' in Tarantula </p> <p><strong> 1959</strong> Wins starring role as Rowdy Yates in new TV western Rawhide.

      "bodyText": "In 1976, John Wayne starred in his final film, The Shootist. The parallels between the Duke and his character, John Bernard Brooks were transparent. Brooks - like Wayne - was dying of cancer. Trying to live out his last years quietly, he can't escape his reputation as a legendary gunfighter. Don Siegel's film was a thoughtful, fond farewell to both the Duke and the western. Wayne was 69 when The Shootist was completed: the lung cancer he had had for two decades killed him three years later. In many ways, Unforgiven was Clint Eastwood's own The Shootist, his requiem for the West and the western. It was even dedicated to 'Sergio and Don', although the message was more revisionist and less elegiac. But while Wayne was saying goodbye to the world, if the 62-year-old Eastwood was taking leave of anything it was the cowboy movie. The very next year he was back in the box office charts, running around - a little out of breath - as a Secret Service agent in In The Line Of Fire. He wasn't about to fade out gracefully. In 10 days time, Clinton Eastwood Jr will turn 70. In three months time, Space Cowboys will be released in the US, starring Clint and contemporaries James Garner and Donald Sutherland - along with comparative youngster Tommy Lee Jones - as a group of astronauts hauled out of retirement. It is Clint's 56th film as an actor, and 22nd as a director. He's been a top-rank movie star for 35 years: few people - Wayne is one - have been consistently popular for as long. In a 1997 Harris poll, he was still America's favourite star. And as he's maintaining a rate of at least a film every two years, there's no reason to think that he's stopping any time soon. Yet in many ways it has been a strange career. Eastwood became a great star of westerns as the genre was dying. He's a man associated with very big guns who got his best reviews for a film - Unforgiven - that seemed to question Hollywood's gun culture, if not in an entirely consistent way. He's an unmistakably American character who has lived almost his whole life in California, yet had to go to Spain to an Italian movie based on a Japanese film to become a star. He's an icon of the US Right but he once said: 'I've always considered myself too individualistic to be either right-wing or left-wing.' And he's a man who at the height of his popularity, when he could have done anything he wanted, chose to make two films co-starring an orang-utan. He was born in San Francisco, 100 miles or so up the coast from his current home of Carmel. His parents were itinerant workers during the Depression. Clinton Jr worked as a lumberjack and in steel mills before being drafted into the army in 1951. Serving as a swimming instructor, he didn't have to go to Korea. It was his army friends who convinced him he could be an actor, and he spent the mid-Fifties doing bit parts in films such as Tarantula , Revenge Of The Creature and Lady Godiva , as well as digging swimming pools to pay the rent.

He'd think maybe that he'd jump-cut forward to a time of plague or terrible famine; that some apocalyptic illness had ravaged the world. </p> <p>He would see famished-looking women with jutting collar bones and over-large eyes. If he went to a fashion show, he would see long-legged, fleshless, impossibly gorgeous and unnatural creatures on the catwalk. If he went to the haunts of the rich and famous, he would notice that their faces often have the same high-cheekboned look, as if they've been stitched up. And, of course, they have been: stitched up, augmented, nipped and tucked and rearranged into the ideal of unattainable female beauty. </p> <p>If he went to the cinema, he would see on the giant screen women who look pasted together from two different patterns, with the generous breasts of suckling mothers and the narrow hips of a pre-pubescent child. If he picked up a glossy magazine, he might see a slim young girl on the front, but actually when he looked again he would realise that the girl is actually grown-up, an adult waif with delicate wrists and shallow breasts and ribs that climb like a ladder up her slender body. </p> <p>If he looked at the newspapers, he'd see a plethora of stories about one female star's underarm hair, another's weight gain, another's weight loss, another's breasts, another's dimpled thighs. If he went to fashionable restaurants he'd see the lettuce leaves and sparkling water on the expensive plates of the women who lunch. </p> <p>Women - such as Calista Flockhart, her Ally McBeal co-star Portia de Rossi, Victoria Beckham, or Jennifer Aniston - who look as though they starve themselves, so that their bodies almost disappear. Women who binge and then void themselves, like Princess Diana. Warrior-women who work out so much they are like soldiers in the grim and ceaseless fight against their bodies, like Demi Moore or Madonna. The hatred of flesh. Muscle and stringy gauntness replacing curves. Bodies that no longer function as bodies. The terror of food. The tyranny of weighing machines and mirrors. We become thinner and thinner, taking up less and less space. In Hollywood, the perfect size is 0. Woman as zero; the ultimate, empty triumph of becoming nothing. </p> <p>We know about this - the image of thinness that oppresses and seduces us wherever we may look. In the same papers that maybe taunt the beautiful and talented Kate Winslet for being too large, there are smaller news stories. Like the fact that nutrition experts in the John Hopkins School of Public Health, who looked at the heights and weights of the winners of Miss America over 78 years, and discovered that not only are they dramatically thinner now than they were eight decades ago (the graph accompanying the story starts its ascent gradually, then becomes like a cliff), but that the current winners are actually dangerously undernourished. They should be in hospital. </p> <p>Or the fact that there are now, apparently, the same number of obese people in the world as malnourished ones - a nastily ironic symmetry. 'You can never be too rich or too thin,' as the saying goes in America. Thinness used to be a sign of poverty, generous flesh of affluence, but that is all inverted now. The richer and more successful a woman is, the thinner she tends to get. </p> <p>Or there's the survey of 18,221 young people by the Schools Education Unit, which revealed that 62 per cent of girls aged 14-15, and 54 per cent of those aged 12-13, said they wanted to lose weight, though most of these young girls were not overweight at all, and many were actually below the normal healthy weight. Or the recent finding that bulimia has trebled in five years. That the age at which girls may become anxious about their body shape is slipping lower (to as young as seven or eight, sometimes). That mothers pass on their neuroses to their daughters. That the number of people known to have anorexia or bulimia in this country at any one time is between 60,000 and 90,000 (though of course the actual numbers must be substantially higher, since the illness is furtive and self-denying). That anorexia is the third most prevalent chronic condition among teenage girls; that the mortality rate is horribly high: between 13 and 20 per cent of sufferers die every year. Self-obliteration is the end-game of anorexia. And in the long-living, death-denying developing world, deathliness has come to possess a strange allure. </p> <p>In exactly a month, on 21 June, at a think tank with health experts and representatives of the fashion industry that is already being called the super-waif summit, the Minister for Women, Tessa Jowell, will chair a debate on the latest research from the Women's Unit on eating disorders. This shows that appearance is the biggest concern among teenage girls, and that more than half of them are on diets, whether they need to be or not. And as the editor of Vogue, Alexandra Shulman, recently said, you don't just catch an eating disorder from opening up a copy of her magazine and seeing a skinny model. It goes wider - and deeper - than that. </p> <p>The statistics, the evident victims (such as Lena Zavaroni), whose emaciated faces and haunted eyes stare from the papers once in an unhappy while - these are just the tip of an iceberg. There is a way in which we are all anorexics now. We read about women starving themselves until they weigh four stone and have downy hair growing all over their barren bodies, and we think of them as strangers - to be pitied, but also in some way grotesque and other. We hear about the size 0 Hollywood women and maybe shrug and swill back another glass of calorific wine, Bridget Jones-style: they are different from us, another species. But it seems to me that most women are infected, to a greater or lesser extent, with the same anxiety about food and about their bodies. It's a condition we all live with. </p> <p>So, for instance, look at this month's special issue of Marie Claire (whose editor, Liz Jones, is a self-confessed anorexic). There are two covers available to choose from. One is Sophie Dahl, the model known above all for her luscious, untrimmed body, like a sensuous Reubens painting, glowing with energy and nourishment. The other is Pamela Anderson, known for her thinness, and her DD breasts. The reader can choose which one she wants, big Sophie Dahl or tiny Pamela Anderson. And on this month's cover of Elle, under the cover line of 'I'm thin, so what', is Calista Flockhart (aka Ally McBeal), who has become, over the past couple of years, increasingly fragile, with legs that look almost as thin at the thigh as at the knee. </p> <p>I look at these opposing figures, and of course I love the way Sophie Dahl looks, just as I love the way Kate Winslet looks. They both appear gorgeously real: real women in an unnatural world. They look properly grown up, fecund and self-pleasing. They aren't going to starve themselves into sharp-boned parodies of womanhood. Their hair won't grow lank, their skin spotty, their teeth decayed. And I look at Calista Flockhart, who doesn't look strong and grown-up but terribly vulnerable and in need of rice pudding and comfort, and out loud I say: 'Oh God, she's horribly thin, she's ill, this is a nightmare'... and a small internal voice that I despise is whispering: 'She's much much thinner than me. I want to be thin like that.' </p> <p>I pull in my stomach. I look at myself in the shop windows as I pass. I skip meals. I think about the way I look with anxiety, vanity, regret. I stare into treacherous mirrors and trace the wrinkles, the mournful lines of ageing. I turn around to see how I look from behind. I am 41, married; I have four children to whom I want to be a good role model; I think that I have ceased to care so much about what people will think of me - but still I am preoccupied about the way I fit in to the world, the space that I occupy. I think a lot about what I put into my body. I don't do this in any dramatic, self-endangering way. I'm not so different from most of my friends, in all their various shapes and sizes. We live in an anorexic culture of guilt and self-punishment, and it's become part of the air we breathe. We watch what we eat. We watch what other people eat. We watch our bodies and theirs. We don't forget our selves. </p> <p>Men don't do this to themselves. It's perfectly straightforward. They spear a piece of food with their fork, put it in their mouths, take pleasure from the taste, swallow it, stop eating when they feel full. But women are always and intensely in their bodies, being looked at and looking at themselves. </p> <p>For most women in the developed world, food is not just functional. It is deeply emotional and symbolic. When a woman cooks a meal for her family, it is as if she is offering a bit of herself; as if the food actually comes from her body, like a sacrament. (This of course makes it hard to refuse; reject the food and you reject her.) Food is ritual. It is where families bond, friendships go, lovers often meet, where the celebrations of the year are marked. It is moral - if you become overweight, you are letting yourself go, forgetting yourself; that won't do. It is a gift, a tyranny, like sex. It comes to stand for everything. </p> <p>I have female friends who eat too much and friends who eat too little; friends who eat when they're lonely or sad or bored or panicky or in love, and friends who stop eating when they're lonely or sad or in love. Friends who hide themselves by eating too much; friends who try to escape from themselves and their adult desires by eating too much. I have friends who are now anxious about their own daughters' attitudes to food. I have very few friends who are like men in their eating habit. Men are allowed to be greedy, but greed is more complicated for women, who for centuries have had to control their greed and their lust. </p> <p>I stand in the kitchen, the heart of the house, with my daughter. I will pass on to her recipes, like my mother passed them on to me when I was her age - but I know I will also pass on attitudes to food. The mother's attitude to food is crucial to how a daughter will react later, and we would all do well to remember this; our neuroses have more influence than the Vogue model and the Hollywood waif. My daughter and I cook lunch together: crisp green salads, soups that are made from mysterious leftovers, in the oven a pie maybe, with meat seeping through the cracked golden pastry, or steaming loaves of dense bread that the butter will melt into. We bake biscuits together, and lemon cakes. </p> <p>I feel most like a good mother when I bake; there have been times in my life when I've whipped up cakes or yeasty buns at midnight, to feel better about being absent during the day. I love food, all kinds of food. I love wine. I love to cook. I read cook books for pleasure (cook books and diet books are simultaneously rising in popularity). If I wake at night I often plan meals in my head. The gifts I will give, to bind them to me. In my head, food is about pleasure, appetite, generosity, conversation, conviviality, life. But in reality, it is just as often divorced from life, and is about denial, or acts as a puritanical reward for a task achieved. </p> <p>Today for breakfast I had three cups of strong black coffee, two thick slices of cucumber while I was making packed lunches for the children, the substantial remains of my youngest daughter's honey roll, an absent-minded handful of crunchy nut flakes without milk. At 10.05am, I had a cup of tea and half a shortbread, because I just happened to be passing by the biscuit tin, and a small slice of cheddar cheese, because I just happened to open the fridge and peer inside. </p> <p>At 11am, I had an apple and another cup of tea. At 1.12pm, I ate a (smallish) bowl of pasta with spicy tomato sauce, some chunks of fennel and a glass of water. At 2.55pm I had another cup of tea. At 4pm I had a juicy red plum. At 6.45pm, I licked the bowl with my daughters after making oat and ginger biscuits. </p> <p>At 7pm I had an oat and ginger biscuit, still piping hot. At 7.30 I had a spicy tomato juice. At 8.10 I had a moderate portion of mushroom and parmesan risotto, lots of salad (lettuce, avocado, tomatoes, cucumber), and two glasses of solid red wine. At 10, I had two cups of tea. I see, looking at this, that I grazed like a cow until evening, which is apparently all the wrong way round. </p> <p>I know that at the time of my life when I was most acutely miserable, I smoked dozens of cigarettes every day and I starved myself. I didn't do so deliberately; I would have said at the time that I just didn't have any appetite (for food, for life), and that eating simply made me feel sick, but in retrospect it is shamefully clear. And probably I rather wanted to look like a victim, made visible and heroic by my suffering. I looked frail. I was one of the walking wounded. </p> <p>Eating disorders aren't a symptom of an illness so much as a defence against the way we feel: when we have unsatisfactory relationships with our parents (mothers), or are bullied, suffer a trauma, feel lonely, angry, scared by life. Food, or the rejection of food, can be a weapon we turn against others or against ourselves. </p> <p>Men suffer from eating disorders, too, but not so much, and not just because men are not so assaulted by the impossible models of thinness. Men tend to direct their emotional distress outwards, whereas women turn it inwards. </p> <p>In the same way that male mid-life crises are often dramatised by tempestuous affairs and a sense of going off the rails, whereas women more frequently become silently and invisibly depressed; or, say, in prison, male prisoners beat up their fellow-inmates in their rage or misery, whereas the female prisoners mutilate themselves, so too starving, bingeing and vomiting are largely female actions of internalised emotions. We turn upon ourselves. We deny ourselves life-giving pleasures. We fret about they way we look, the size we are, the space we fill. We want to be powerful and we want to be size 0. The perfect zero, disappearing into the unassailable purity of nothing. </p> <p>I haven't eaten a doughnut in months. Have you? </p> <p><strong>Three square meals... and the rest</strong></p> <p>The Observer asked three women to keep a record of a typical day at the fridge door</p> <p><strong> Sylvia Bunce, 62, housewife, Norfolk </strong></p> <p><strong>Monday 16 May </strong></p> <p><strong>Breakfast:</strong> Small glass of orange juice, two slices of soda bread, baked beans, two rashers of vegetarian bacon. So far so good. Determined to stick to new diet. Low-fat spread on bread, skimmed milk and Canderel tablets in tea. </p> <p><strong> 11am</strong> Cup of Options chocolate drink. Only 40 calories. Feel smug. </p> <p><strong> Lunch:</strong> Cut two crusty slices for a sandwich and fill with 40g of brie. Delicious. Before I can stop myself, have cut and eaten the same again. Never mind, will make it up later. </p> <p><strong> 4.30pm</strong> Two cups of tea and a scone and butter. Feel terrible but scones cry out for butter. </p> <p><strong> Dinner:</strong> Vegetable spring rolls, rice and stir-fry vegetables. Have cooked too much rice. Instead of 150g I now have 250g on my plate plus two spring rolls and a whole heap of stir-fry which just had to be cooked in olive oil. Fresh fruit salad for pudding. Planned to have just the fruit but when I saw the cream on my husband's portion quickly poured the same on mine. Oh well, having lost it again I may as well enjoy myself. </p> <p><strong> Later on:</strong> Eat a packet of chocolate buttons intended for my granddaughter, followed by two Penguin biscuits. Feel ashamed but mustn't despair. Tomorrow will be different. </p> <p><strong> Kim Ash, 34, interior designer, Leeds </strong></p> <p><strong>Monday 16 May </strong></p> <p><strong>8.30am</strong> Breakfast. I crave a Pret a Manger muesli muffin but ask for a pretzel (less calories) and black coffee with nutrasweet sweetener. It totals two Weight Watcher points. My allowance for the day is 22 points which I have already programmed into my Weight Watchers database. </p> <p><strong> 12.20am</strong> Tea with semi-skimmed milk. </p> <p><strong> 1.15pm</strong> Lunch at Greek restaurant. I pick at the olives on the table and choose a Greek salad without the 'special dressing'. The only fattening ingredient is the feta cheese, of which I eat half and leave the rest on the plate. Three small strips of pitta bread, three half slices of orange and four small squares of melon. One square of dusted turkish delight which I don't like and wish I hadn't eaten the minute it passes my lips. Greek coffee. I count the whole lot as about seven W.W. points and input them into my database. I kid myself that I'm not being conservative with the points on the feta cheese front. </p> <p><strong> 3.30pm</strong> Black coffee plus Weight Watchers chocolate bar which has 92 calories and 1.5g of saturated fat. I always carry one in my bag in case I crave something sweet. </p> <p><strong> 7.00pm</strong> Consider going without dinner to get the gratifying feeling of knowing I'm losing weight. </p> <p><strong> 7.30pm</strong> Decide to have dinner after all. Count On Us pepper and sundried tomato pasta from Marks and Spencer's - 20 minutes in the oven, five minutes to eat and 260 calories. Four Weight Watcher points. </p> <p>Two glasses of red wine - two Weight Watcher points well used. </p> <p><strong> 8.00pm</strong> Go-Ahead chocolate dessert which has been on my mind since before dinner - 160 calories, 2.5g of saturated fat and three Weight Watcher points. </p> <p><strong> Later on:</strong> Cup of Light Horlicks and a digestive biscuit. </p> <p><strong> Check my data base.</strong> Exactly 22 points. Go to bed, dreaming of breakfast. </p> <p><strong> Lucy Joseph, 29, advertising agency account director, north London </strong></p> <p><strong>Thursday 18 May </strong></p> <p><strong>Breakfast:</strong> Glass of freshly-squeezed orange juice, two cups of coffee, cigarette. Decide against food, as still have 10 pounds to lose after birth of son 18 months ago, but sneak one of his leftover marmite soldiers. </p> <p><strong> 10am:</strong> Starbucks grande latte with non-fat milk. Resist blueberry muffin. </p> <p><strong> Lunch:</strong> Pret a Manger crayfish sandwich with 'lite' lemon mayonnaise and rocket (seafood is low in calories). Fruit salad. Small bottle Evian water. </p> <p><strong> 4pm</strong> Large cup Earl Gray tea, non-fat milk. </p> <p><strong> 7pm</strong> Two (or three?) glasses of white wine at launch party for friend's book. Quite a lot of tortilla chips and cigarettes. </p> <p><strong> 9.15pm</strong> Decide against dinner due to excess tortilla chips and wine. Have cup of decaffeinated coffee and two squares of Marks and Spencer's white chocolate instead. Go to bed pleased not to have eaten much. Might dare to weigh myself in the morning. </p> <p> Kim Ash and Lucy Joseph are pseudonyms</p>",

      "bodyText": "If a Rip Van Winkle woke from a 50-year sleep today, and turned on the TV, what would he think? He'd think maybe that he'd jump-cut forward to a time of plague or terrible famine; that some apocalyptic illness had ravaged the world. He would see famished-looking women with jutting collar bones and over-large eyes. If he went to a fashion show, he would see long-legged, fleshless, impossibly gorgeous and unnatural creatures on the catwalk. If he went to the haunts of the rich and famous, he would notice that their faces often have the same high-cheekboned look, as if they've been stitched up. And, of course, they have been: stitched up, augmented, nipped and tucked and rearranged into the ideal of unattainable female beauty. If he went to the cinema, he would see on the giant screen women who look pasted together from two different patterns, with the generous breasts of suckling mothers and the narrow hips of a pre-pubescent child. If he picked up a glossy magazine, he might see a slim young girl on the front, but actually when he looked again he would realise that the girl is actually grown-up, an adult waif with delicate wrists and shallow breasts and ribs that climb like a ladder up her slender body. If he looked at the newspapers, he'd see a plethora of stories about one female star's underarm hair, another's weight gain, another's weight loss, another's breasts, another's dimpled thighs. If he went to fashionable restaurants he'd see the lettuce leaves and sparkling water on the expensive plates of the women who lunch. Women - such as Calista Flockhart, her Ally McBeal co-star Portia de Rossi, Victoria Beckham, or Jennifer Aniston - who look as though they starve themselves, so that their bodies almost disappear. Women who binge and then void themselves, like Princess Diana. Warrior-women who work out so much they are like soldiers in the grim and ceaseless fight against their bodies, like Demi Moore or Madonna. The hatred of flesh. Muscle and stringy gauntness replacing curves. Bodies that no longer function as bodies. The terror of food. The tyranny of weighing machines and mirrors. We become thinner and thinner, taking up less and less space. In Hollywood, the perfect size is 0. Woman as zero; the ultimate, empty triumph of becoming nothing. We know about this - the image of thinness that oppresses and seduces us wherever we may look. In the same papers that maybe taunt the beautiful and talented Kate Winslet for being too large, there are smaller news stories. Like the fact that nutrition experts in the John Hopkins School of Public Health, who looked at the heights and weights of the winners of Miss America over 78 years, and discovered that not only are they dramatically thinner now than they were eight decades ago (the graph accompanying the story starts its ascent gradually, then becomes like a cliff), but that the current winners are actually dangerously undernourished. They should be in hospital. Or the fact that there are now, apparently, the same number of obese people in the world as malnourished ones - a nastily ironic symmetry. 'You can never be too rich or too thin,' as the saying goes in America. Thinness used to be a sign of poverty, generous flesh of affluence, but that is all inverted now. The richer and more successful a woman is, the thinner she tends to get. Or there's the survey of 18,221 young people by the Schools Education Unit, which revealed that 62 per cent of girls aged 14-15, and 54 per cent of those aged 12-13, said they wanted to lose weight, though most of these young girls were not overweight at all, and many were actually below the normal healthy weight. Or the recent finding that bulimia has trebled in five years. That the age at which girls may become anxious about their body shape is slipping lower (to as young as seven or eight, sometimes). That mothers pass on their neuroses to their daughters. That the number of people known to have anorexia or bulimia in this country at any one time is between 60,000 and 90,000 (though of course the actual numbers must be substantially higher, since the illness is furtive and self-denying). That anorexia is the third most prevalent chronic condition among teenage girls; that the mortality rate is horribly high: between 13 and 20 per cent of sufferers die every year. Self-obliteration is the end-game of anorexia. And in the long-living, death-denying developing world, deathliness has come to possess a strange allure. In exactly a month, on 21 June, at a think tank with health experts and representatives of the fashion industry that is already being called the super-waif summit, the Minister for Women, Tessa Jowell, will chair a debate on the latest research from the Women's Unit on eating disorders.

So, for instance, look at this month's special issue of Marie Claire (whose editor, Liz Jones, is a self-confessed anorexic). There are two covers available to choose from. One is Sophie Dahl, the model known above all for her luscious, untrimmed body, like a sensuous Reubens painting, glowing with energy and nourishment. The other is Pamela Anderson, known for her thinness, and her DD breasts. The reader can choose which one she wants, big Sophie Dahl or tiny Pamela Anderson. And on this month's cover of Elle, under the cover line of 'I'm thin, so what', is Calista Flockhart (aka Ally McBeal), who has become, over the past couple of years, increasingly fragile, with legs that look almost as thin at the thigh as at the knee. I look at these opposing figures, and of course I love the way Sophie Dahl looks, just as I love the way Kate Winslet looks. They both appear gorgeously real: real women in an unnatural world. They look properly grown up, fecund and self-pleasing. They aren't going to starve themselves into sharp-boned parodies of womanhood. Their hair won't grow lank, their skin spotty, their teeth decayed. And I look at Calista Flockhart, who doesn't look strong and grown-up but terribly vulnerable and in need of rice pudding and comfort, and out loud I say: 'Oh God, she's horribly thin, she's ill, this is a nightmare'... and a small internal voice that I despise is whispering: 'She's much much thinner than me. I want to be thin like that.' I pull in my stomach. I look at myself in the shop windows as I pass. I skip meals. I think about the way I look with anxiety, vanity, regret.

Eating disorders aren't a symptom of an illness so much as a defence against the way we feel: when we have unsatisfactory relationships with our parents (mothers), or are bullied, suffer a trauma, feel lonely, angry, scared by life. Food, or the rejection of food, can be a weapon we turn against others or against ourselves. Men suffer from eating disorders, too, but not so much, and not just because men are not so assaulted by the impossible models of thinness. Men tend to direct their emotional distress outwards, whereas women turn it inwards.

Three square meals... and the rest The Observer asked three women to keep a record of a typical day at the fridge door Sylvia Bunce, 62, housewife, Norfolk Monday 16 May Breakfast: Small glass of orange juice, two slices of soda bread, baked beans, two rashers of vegetarian bacon. So far so good. Determined to stick to new diet. Low-fat spread on bread, skimmed milk and Canderel tablets in tea. 11am Cup of Options chocolate drink. Only 40 calories. Feel smug. Lunch: Cut two crusty slices for a sandwich and fill with 40g of brie. Delicious. Before I can stop myself, have cut and eaten the same again. Never mind, will make it up later. 4.30pm Two cups of tea and a scone and butter. Feel terrible but scones cry out for butter. Dinner: Vegetable spring rolls, rice and stir-fry vegetables. Have cooked too much rice. Instead of 150g I now have 250g on my plate plus two spring rolls and a whole heap of stir-fry which just had to be cooked in olive oil. Fresh fruit salad for pudding. Planned to have just the fruit but when I saw the cream on my husband's portion quickly poured the same on mine. Oh well, having lost it again I may as well enjoy myself. Later on: Eat a packet of chocolate buttons intended for my granddaughter, followed by two Penguin biscuits. Feel ashamed but mustn't despair. Tomorrow will be different. Kim Ash, 34, interior designer, Leeds Monday 16 May 8.30am Breakfast. I crave a Pret a Manger muesli muffin but ask for a pretzel (less calories) and black coffee with nutrasweet sweetener. It totals two Weight Watcher points. My allowance for the day is 22 points which I have already programmed into my Weight Watchers database. 12.20am Tea with semi-skimmed milk. 1.15pm Lunch at Greek restaurant. I pick at the olives on the table and choose a Greek salad without the 'special dressing'. The only fattening ingredient is the feta cheese, of which I eat half and leave the rest on the plate. Three small strips of pitta bread, three half slices of orange and four small squares of melon. One square of dusted turkish delight which I don't like and wish I hadn't eaten the minute it passes my lips. Greek coffee. I count the whole lot as about seven W.W. points and input them into my database. I kid myself that I'm not being conservative with the points on the feta cheese front. 3.30pm Black coffee plus Weight Watchers chocolate bar which has 92 calories and 1.5g of saturated fat. I always carry one in my bag in case I crave something sweet. 7.00pm Consider going without dinner to get the gratifying feeling of knowing I'm losing weight. 7.30pm Decide to have dinner after all. Count On Us pepper and sundried tomato pasta from Marks and Spencer's - 20 minutes in the oven, five minutes to eat and 260 calories. Four Weight Watcher points. Two glasses of red wine - two Weight Watcher points well used. 8.00pm Go-Ahead chocolate dessert which has been on my mind since before dinner - 160 calories, 2.5g of saturated fat and three Weight Watcher points. Later on: Cup of Light Horlicks and a digestive biscuit. Check my data base. Exactly 22 points. Go to bed, dreaming of breakfast. Lucy Joseph, 29, advertising agency account director, north London Thursday 18 May Breakfast: Glass of freshly-squeezed orange juice, two cups of coffee, cigarette. Decide against food, as still have 10 pounds to lose after birth of son 18 months ago, but sneak one of his leftover marmite soldiers. 10am: Starbucks grande latte with non-fat milk. Resist blueberry muffin. Lunch: Pret a Manger crayfish sandwich with 'lite' lemon mayonnaise and rocket (seafood is low in calories). Fruit salad. Small bottle Evian water. 4pm Large cup Earl Gray tea, non-fat milk. 7pm Two (or three?) glasses of white wine at launch party for friend's book. Quite a lot of tortilla chips and cigarettes. 9.15pm Decide against dinner due to excess tortilla chips and wine. Have cup of decaffeinated coffee and two squares of Marks and Spencer's white chocolate instead. Go to bed pleased not to have eaten much. Might dare to weigh myself in the morning.

The winner was Martin Amis: My Struggle. And here, two decades later, is the volume in question (though Amis has favoured one of his trademark blunt monikers for it: after Success and Money comes Experience ). It is an almost mythic tale of lost daughters and absent fathers, of betrayal and death and dentistry. Reading it, I found a line from an old Talking Heads song looping in my brain: 'And you may find yourself in a beautiful house with a beautiful wife, and you may say to yourself: how did I get here?' </p> <p>How Amis got here is for the most part all too well-known; the lives of few writers can have been the subject of as much chat as this one. His memoir archly assumes a working knowledge of the basic intrigues of his household from the outset (if you don't know this much, you can hear him thinking, where have you been?). We are thus pitched in on first-name terms not only with Kingsley but also with Hilly (the mother) and Jane (Elizabeth Jane Howard, the stepmother), Isabel (Fonseca, the second wife) and the Hitch (Christopher Hitchens, the best mate). </p> <p>And it begins, as do all Amis books, already weary with itself and the world, hardly bothered to be roused to self-revelation. If it was down to him, he suggests, he would probably have kept quiet about this stuff. Still, he has no choice but to tell his side of the story: life and the newspapers have ambushed him, you see, and the tale will out. Anyway, we live in the age of 'the memoir, the apologia, the CV, the cri de coeur' (and the list). Everyone has a confessional in them; luckily, he knows all the tricks, and he has the nudge-nudge italics and spiralling footnotes to prove it. </p> <p>Amis's extended soliloquy has been ushered in, in recent weeks, by the publication of the late Kingsley's (the king, my father's) letters: prejudice and slander and inspired harumphing from beyond the grave. Amis has the ghost of his father beside him as he writes; but if he now casts himself as Hamlet, with death everywhere he looks ('There's just the usual trouble: age, and the only end of age'), he started out, as he says, as Osric, an attendant lord, tricked up in crushed green velvet strides and snakeskin boots, 'short-arseing' along the King's Road, failing to pick up girls.</p> <p>His book is punctuated with missives from this flared and speedy youth, wonderfully earnest letters to his father from his time at an Oxbridge crammer, explaining how 'Kafka is a fucking fool' and how 'I consider Middlemarch to be Fucking good'. These letters stand for innocence in the Amis universe. </p> <p>Experience really started to kick in when the author was in his mid-twenties. It began with the inexplicable disappearance of his cousin, Lucy Partington, with whose family the young Martin spent idyllic childish summers, and it continued with him fathering a daughter he was not permitted to know, Delilah Seale, after an affair with a married woman, Lamorna Heath, who subsequently committed suicide. Out of these twin absences, he intuits a retrospective psychology for himself and his fiction, and the psychology is one of loss, a submerged sense of estrangement, what he calls his 'missing'. </p> <p>This sublimated denial found its abrupt catharsis nearly 20 years later when it was discovered that Lucy was one of the murdered victims of Fred West, her body exhumed in Cromwell Street, confirming all of the family's worst fears; and when Amis was finally introduced to his 19-year-old daughter in a hotel bar, confirming all his best hopes. These twin revelations followed hard upon his divorce from his first wife, Antonia Phillips, with whom he had two sons, and prefigured the illness and death of his father. Taken together, and with the saga of his rotten teeth - a keenly felt mortality - thrown in, these events form the basis of a fluidly structured meditation on love and loss. In some ways, this is a survivor's story; it is also a (belated) coming of age. </p> <p>Amis has always been self-consciously preoccupied with the passing of his allotted span. When he experienced the onset of what he grandly calls his 'climacteric', he responded with his midlife crisis novel The Information, in which the narrator turns 40 'like a half-cooked steak, like a wired cop, like an old leaf, like milk'. Now, at 50, Amis seems to see himself as having come to terms with this insistent whisper of mortality to achieve something like wisdom; 'Youth, that time of constant imposture, when you have to pretend to understand everything while understanding nothing at all', has fled. His election to adulthood is confirmed by his surrogate father, his hero and mentor Saul Bellow.
