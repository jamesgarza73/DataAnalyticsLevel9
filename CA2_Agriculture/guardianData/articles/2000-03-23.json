Following a series of laughable failures by virtually all the contenders for the second place behind Charlton Athletic, however, Ipswich Town finally seem to have realised that the play-offs are not all they are cracked up to be and that the anonymity of second place might not be so bad after all. Failure in the play-offs in the last three seasons has made Ipswich something of a joke, in Norfolk at least, but George Burley's team are finally smiling themselves now after a worrying sequence of five matches without a win cast serious doubts about their promotion credentials. They could scarcely have asked for more accommodating hosts than Tranmere and it was hardly a surprise when Ipswich, having already gone close twice through Jamie Scowcroft, opened the scoring on 19 minutes. Jermaine Wright's fierce drive was parried by the home goalkeeper Joe Murphy but only into the path of Matt Holland, who hooked the ball into the net from six yards. It was no less than Ipswich Town deserved as they made an enterprising start following a potentially morale-sapping recent sequence of results. Mark Venus shaved the Tranmere crossbar with a free-kick and Jamie Clapham forced a fine save from Murphy, whose team-mates produced precisely zilch in reply until Gary Jones volleyed over just before the interval. The second half was even more one-sided and Ipswich would not have been unduly flattered had they run up a tally of half a dozen goals. Scowcroft twice headed against the woodwork before inadvertently clearing another effort off the line from his team-mate Clapham. David Johnson, the striker whose baffling early-season dalliance with Scotland and Jamaica make him the only man in football who can understand the current nationality crisis in Welsh and Scottish rugby union, wasted two opportunities before finally making his mark with a scrambled overhead kick that settled the match on 57 minutes.",

Arsenal have only lost three-nil once in Europe.<br></p> <p><strong>1 min</strong> Bremen start the match and surrender possession to Adams. A cacophony of whistles greets every Arsenal players touch - Bremen have crowded the midfield early and are looking to control the action through the middle.<br><strong>2</strong> A bad error from Luzhny lets Ailton in for a dig at Manninger from the left of the area. the effort is a poor one, but a good chance gone begging for the home side - Dixon was well out of position and Adams lets him know about it.<br><strong>6</strong> Bremen are looking to get the ball to the forwards as quickly as possible - Arsenal will have to weather the storm during the opening moments. A free kick to Bremen after Adams 'fouled' Ailton. Wiedener looks to test Manninger with his left boot. The shot clears the wall but Manninger saves well.<br><strong>8 GOAL Werder Bremen 0 - 1 Arsenal</strong> Manninger's clearance finds Kanu on the right. The Nigerian takes the ball to the corner flag, drawing two defenders with him. His clever pass finds Ray Parlour on the right of the area. The Arsenal midfielder drives a rising shot from 20 yards with the outside of his right boot. The left upright does its part, making the goal aesthetically all the more pleasing. A great away goal that has knocked the stuffing out of the home side.<br><strong>12</strong> Kanu played through again. This time, the Arsenal playmaker drives a good, low shot at Rost and the Bremen keeper does well to turn the effort round his right-hand post. The corner is swung into the near post and Bremen clear well upfield.<br><strong>16</strong> Freddie Ljundberg refuses to bear false witness as another great through ball from Kanu sends the Swede through on Rost. Baumann appears to shove Freddie in the back, but Ljundberg stays on his feet and tries to finish the job. The push has disturbed his equilibrium and Bremen are able to clear.<br><strong>19</strong> Ljundberg breaking forward for Arsenal with Kanu and Henry advancing with intent on the Bremen goal. Freddie can't pick either of them out and Bremen tidy up.<br><strong>20</strong> Bremen drive upfield and win a corner. Arsenal clear as far as Herzog, who volleys but the connection is a poor one. The ball falls invitingly for Barten, who slides the ball goalwards with Manniger well beaten, but Ray Parlour, scourge of Bremen, clears off the line.<br><strong>23</strong> Trares rounds off a promising Bremen move by slicing his shot so far wide of the Arsenal goal that Manninger stopped watching it the moment it left his boot.<br><strong>25 GOAL Werder Bremen 0 - 2 Arsenal</strong> Same guy, same post. Ray beats three (count 'em - three!) Werder defenders before sliding the ball home past Rost and off his favourite post. If he gets a hat-trick off the same upright does he get to keep it? The 34,000 Bremen fans cannot believe it - Ray Parlour?!<br><strong>28</strong> Werder are still plugging away, trying to find a way through. Their challenges are beginning to border on the agricultural. Referee Nielsen may have a busy night.<br><strong>32</strong> The more Werder push up, the larger the gaps in their defence must appear to this Arsenal side. Ljundberg almost through again and a good challenge from Pizarro spares Bremen's blushes.<br><strong>35</strong> Ljundberg beats Frings and plays in Kanu, who lays it back for Henry. His shot is destined for the bottom corner but somehow Rost turns it around the post. The corner is a poor one, but this Bremen side look like they have been instructed to haemorrhage goals.<br><strong>39</strong> Silvinhno fancies his chances from a set-piece 25 yards out. His effort clears the six-man wall and Rost is a picture of cool as the Arsenal midfielder's shot cannons off the post. The supporters don't know whether to cheer or cry.<br><strong>42 GOAL Werder Bremen 1 - 2 Arsenal</strong> A tiny glimmer of hope for Bremen as a corner to the near post is met by Bode, who has managed to slip Vieira. Manninger has also come for the centre and his positioning gives him no chance after the forward had deflected it goalwards.<br><strong>44</strong> Bremen press forward with a little more purpose, lifted by the goal. Weidener meets Parlour on the left and flings himself to the ground. The ball rolls dead and the referee awards... a goal kick. Weidener is on a yellow and has to watch his deportment. Manninger is booked for taking his time over the goal kick.<br><strong>46</strong> Kanu flicks a Parlour free kick goalwards. The effort is deflected and the ricochet falls to Ljundberg, who draws a great save from Rost. Adams collects the keeper's parry and seems to have rounded Rost and only has to punt the ball into an empty net, but Rost travels through time and space to deny the Arsenal skipper.<br><strong>47</strong> Half time comes not a moment too soon for the home side.<br></p> <p><strong>45</strong> Big reshuffle for the home side as Bogdanovic is on and Bremen look like they're playing... five up front? Well, maybe not, but a <i>very</i> attacking line up for the home side an only mean more chances for Arsenal.<br><strong>48</strong> Arsenal have started very brightly. Already they're on their second corner of the half. Parlour takes and Grimandi flicks on to Vieira at the far post. A Bremen defender deflects his effort and another corner results. This time Bremen are able to clear.<br><strong>50</strong> Kanu played through but the Nigerian takes an age to drag back his right foot and drive the ball goalwards. Pizarro manages to block the effort for yet another corner. Again, the delivery is disappointing and the home side are happy to hoof the ball upfield.<br><strong>52</strong> Ailton looks to have beaten the offside trap as Arsenal hold the line. The linesman's flag rises as Ailton's drive rises over Manninger's crossbar. Nothing going right for Bremen tonight.<br><strong>53</strong> Vieira loses the ball to Ailton on the right, but the Brazilian's cross aimed at two unmarked teammates is too low and Manninger gathers easily. A let off for Arsenal, who have Overmars and Petit warming up on the sidelines, to add to Bremen's woes.<br><strong>55</strong> Henry uncharacteristically profligate in front of goal. With only Rost to beat from 15 yards, his shot is a soft one straight into the keeper's arms. Parlour should jog over and give the French international striker some tips.<br><strong>59 GOAL Werder Bremen 1 - 3 Arsenal</strong> If he doesn't score them, he makes them. Kanu spots Parlour ghosting through the offside trap and the carrot-topped goal machine shows his unselfish side in squaring to Henry who cannot miss from 10 yards. Game over.<br><strong>60 GOAL Werder Bremen 2 - 3 Arsenal</strong> A nice goal for the home side scored pretty much from the restart. Ailton looks to get on the end of a Pizarro centre. Arsenal get it clear, but only as far as Rade Bogdanovic, who beats Manninger from 15 yards with a good volley but this is all academic and the celebrations are muted.<br><strong>61 Arsenal substitution:</strong> Petit for Adams.<br><strong>63 Sent off:</strong> Henry (serious foul play) sent from the pitch for a poor challenge on Barten. The Bremen forward has rolled over nine times after the badly-timed tackle. Referee Nielsen immediately shows the red card to the Frenchman. As soon as the Danish ref wields the red, Barten springs to his feet like Lazarus. He cannot believe it and neither can Wenger, who is going ballistic on the touchline. Even the partisan German crowd seem embarrassed with this farcical dismissal.<br><strong>70 GOAL Werder Bremen 2 - 4 Arsenal</strong> A hat-trick for Parlour as he gets the better of Rost on a one-on-one. This must be one of the new Officially Sanctioned UEFA Crazy Games and Arsenal look to contribute a little more to the mayhem by bringing on Overmars immediately after the goal.<br><strong>73</strong> A free kick to Bremen 25 yards out centre-left. Pizarro takes and blasts the ball over the Arsenal crossbar. Missing chances has been desperately unfashionable for the last 73 minutes.<br><strong>77 Arsenal substitution:</strong> Winterburn for Vieira. Just about enough time for the veteran defender to grab a brace...<br><strong>79</strong> Bogdanovic feeds Bode on the edge of the box - his volley is sweet and Manninger manages to parry the effort wide of his right-hand post. The corner is aimed at the far post and Manninger comes to claim it at his near post and misses it by a matter of metres. A shot comes in from Pizarro and Manninger saves well again.<br><strong>83</strong> So the question on everyone's lips is can Werder score five in eight minutes? I'll stick my neck out here and say... no. Barten (boo, hiss, behind you etc.) obstructs Ljundberg in front of goal and under the nose of referee Neilsen. The Danish official has seen enough incident for one evening and lets play continue.<br><strong>86</strong> No-one has told Manninger that this is now a formality. He saves well from Bode and Bremen win another corner. The delivery is good - a whipped in centre that Manninger does well to claim.<br><strong>89</strong> Ljundberg is fouled and needs treatment on his ribs. As the Swede is tended to off the field, Arsenal press forward through Parlour (who else?) who only just fails to find Overmars when the flying Dutchman would have been through on Rost.<br><strong>91</strong> Werder are still game, flooding forward. Pizarro sets himself 20 yards out but can only blaze his shot over Manninger's crossbar. The crowd appreciate his efforts, though.<br><strong>93</strong> Full time: Werder Bremen 2 - 4 Arsenal. The Gunners go through to their fifth European semi-final.<br></p>",

Referee Nielsen may have a busy night. 32 The more Werder push up, the larger the gaps in their defence must appear to this Arsenal side. Ljundberg almost through again and a good challenge from Pizarro spares Bremen's blushes. 35 Ljundberg beats Frings and plays in Kanu, who lays it back for Henry. His shot is destined for the bottom corner but somehow Rost turns it around the post. The corner is a poor one, but this Bremen side look like they have been instructed to haemorrhage goals. 39 Silvinhno fancies his chances from a set-piece 25 yards out. His effort clears the six-man wall and Rost is a picture of cool as the Arsenal midfielder's shot cannons off the post. The supporters don't know whether to cheer or cry. 42 GOAL Werder Bremen 1 - 2 Arsenal A tiny glimmer of hope for Bremen as a corner to the near post is met by Bode, who has managed to slip Vieira. Manninger has also come for the centre and his positioning gives him no chance after the forward had deflected it goalwards. 44 Bremen press forward with a little more purpose, lifted by the goal. Weidener meets Parlour on the left and flings himself to the ground. The ball rolls dead and the referee awards... a goal kick. Weidener is on a yellow and has to watch his deportment. Manninger is booked for taking his time over the goal kick. 46 Kanu flicks a Parlour free kick goalwards. The effort is deflected and the ricochet falls to Ljundberg, who draws a great save from Rost. Adams collects the keeper's parry and seems to have rounded Rost and only has to punt the ball into an empty net, but Rost travels through time and space to deny the Arsenal skipper. 47 Half time comes not a moment too soon for the home side. 45 Big reshuffle for the home side as Bogdanovic is on and Bremen look like they're playing... five up front? Well, maybe not, but a very attacking line up for the home side an only mean more chances for Arsenal. 48 Arsenal have started very brightly. Already they're on their second corner of the half. Parlour takes and Grimandi flicks on to Vieira at the far post. A Bremen defender deflects his effort and another corner results. This time Bremen are able to clear. 50 Kanu played through but the Nigerian takes an age to drag back his right foot and drive the ball goalwards. Pizarro manages to block the effort for yet another corner. Again, the delivery is disappointing and the home side are happy to hoof the ball upfield. 52 Ailton looks to have beaten the offside trap as Arsenal hold the line. The linesman's flag rises as Ailton's drive rises over Manninger's crossbar. Nothing going right for Bremen tonight. 53 Vieira loses the ball to Ailton on the right, but the Brazilian's cross aimed at two unmarked teammates is too low and Manninger gathers easily. A let off for Arsenal, who have Overmars and Petit warming up on the sidelines, to add to Bremen's woes. 55 Henry uncharacteristically profligate in front of goal. With only Rost to beat from 15 yards, his shot is a soft one straight into the keeper's arms. Parlour should jog over and give the French international striker some tips. 59 GOAL Werder Bremen 1 - 3 Arsenal If he doesn't score them, he makes them. Kanu spots Parlour ghosting through the offside trap and the carrot-topped goal machine shows his unselfish side in squaring to Henry who cannot miss from 10 yards. Game over. 60 GOAL Werder Bremen 2 - 3 Arsenal A nice goal for the home side scored pretty much from the restart. Ailton looks to get on the end of a Pizarro centre. Arsenal get it clear, but only as far as Rade Bogdanovic, who beats Manninger from 15 yards with a good volley but this is all academic and the celebrations are muted. 61 Arsenal substitution: Petit for Adams. 63 Sent off: Henry (serious foul play) sent from the pitch for a poor challenge on Barten. The Bremen forward has rolled over nine times after the badly-timed tackle. Referee Nielsen immediately shows the red card to the Frenchman. As soon as the Danish ref wields the red, Barten springs to his feet like Lazarus. He cannot believe it and neither can Wenger, who is going ballistic on the touchline. Even the partisan German crowd seem embarrassed with this farcical dismissal. 70 GOAL Werder Bremen 2 - 4 Arsenal A hat-trick for Parlour as he gets the better of Rost on a one-on-one. This must be one of the new Officially Sanctioned UEFA Crazy Games and Arsenal look to contribute a little more to the mayhem by bringing on Overmars immediately after the goal. 73 A free kick to Bremen 25 yards out centre-left. Pizarro takes and blasts the ball over the Arsenal crossbar. Missing chances has been desperately unfashionable for the last 73 minutes. 77 Arsenal substitution: Winterburn for Vieira. Just about enough time for the veteran defender to grab a brace... 79 Bogdanovic feeds Bode on the edge of the box - his volley is sweet and Manninger manages to parry the effort wide of his right-hand post. The corner is aimed at the far post and Manninger comes to claim it at his near post and misses it by a matter of metres. A shot comes in from Pizarro and Manninger saves well again. 83 So the question on everyone's lips is can Werder score five in eight minutes? I'll stick my neck out here and say... no. Barten (boo, hiss, behind you etc.) obstructs Ljundberg in front of goal and under the nose of referee Neilsen. The Danish official has seen enough incident for one evening and lets play continue. 86 No-one has told Manninger that this is now a formality. He saves well from Bode and Bremen win another corner. The delivery is good - a whipped in centre that Manninger does well to claim. 89 Ljundberg is fouled and needs treatment on his ribs. As the Swede is tended to off the field, Arsenal press forward through Parlour (who else?) who only just fails to find Overmars when the flying Dutchman would have been through on Rost. 91 Werder are still game, flooding forward. Pizarro sets himself 20 yards out but can only blaze his shot over Manninger's crossbar. The crowd appreciate his efforts, though. 93 Full time: Werder Bremen 2 - 4 Arsenal. The Gunners go through to their fifth European semi-final.",

      "byline": "Paul Weaver",

      "body": "<p>Scotland, once you have recovered from feeling underdressed without a snowplough, is a deeply impressive country.</p> <p>The standard of living seems higher, the education superior, the laws invariably wiser and the roads better. Prudence, like heather, sprouts everywhere. They also make matchless malts, peerless James Bonds and do a nifty line in chancellors of the exchequer.</p> <p>In fact there is only one thing I can't take seriously in Scotland: its football. It has always represented a gigglefest, whether it's Jimmy Johnstone cast adrift in a boat before a big game, the hyperbole of Ally MacLeod, a goalkeeper swinging from the crossbar with his back to the pitch while a goal is scored, or a sequence of gormless results against teams from countries you couldn't find in an atlas with a strong magnifying glass.</p> <p>Whereas it is possible to watch shinty, a tough, physical and skilful game, and such activities as caber tossing with real admiration, there are some of us who find it difficult to watch the football without clutching our tummies while tears of mirth drip merrily from our chins. Which is precisely why I will be watching Scotland's match against France next Wednesday.</p> <p>Nationally the obsession is to beat England, which is a classic case of aiming low. Domestically the game revolves around the Old Firm battle, a four-times-a-season re-enactment of the Battle of the Boyne on the banks of the Clyde.</p> <p>I say this at the risk of being slit open with a skean-dhu on my next venture north of Hadrian's Wall because in Scotland, it seems, there are a lot of people who take football very seriously indeed.</p> <p>The place, in fact, is fitba' daft. I know this because I have just disinterred my nose from We'll Support You Evermore, which will be re-published next week.</p> <p>It is a ribald read, a heartfelt collection of reminiscences about games, after-match celebrations and growing up in the streets of Glasgow.</p> <p>This gem was first published 24 years ago after a friendly pub argument between our own Ian Archer and Trevor Royle, then the literary director of the Scottish Arts Council. Archer argued that football correspondents made the best writers on football; Royle said novelists were better. So here they are combined.</p> <p>Royle said yesterday: \"The book was a sell-out and was due to be reprinted in 1978. But Scotland fared so badly in the World Cup in Argentina, with bad results against Peru and Iran, that the idea was dropped.\"</p> <p>Here, novelists such as Alan Sharp and Gordon Williams vie with journos such as Archer, John Rafferty and Hugh Taylor to capture the essence of Scottish football. Royle's own favourite is the piece by Williams, who wrote the Hazel television series with Terry Venables, writing as a drunk-as-a-skunk Scotland supporter going home by bus after a victory over England.</p> <p>\"Excuse me, Missus, is this the right bus for my house? I'm saying, is this the richt bus fur ma hoose, Mrs McFlannel? Non comprendey? Come on, you crabbit auld devil, give us a song and I'll give ye a swig.</p> <p>\"We'll support ye evermore. Aye, you're right, Missus, greatest wee country Goad iver put breath intae. When the first goal went in I threw a wee fella next tae me up in the air.

      "bodyText": "Scotland, once you have recovered from feeling underdressed without a snowplough, is a deeply impressive country. The standard of living seems higher, the education superior, the laws invariably wiser and the roads better. Prudence, like heather, sprouts everywhere. They also make matchless malts, peerless James Bonds and do a nifty line in chancellors of the exchequer. In fact there is only one thing I can't take seriously in Scotland: its football. It has always represented a gigglefest, whether it's Jimmy Johnstone cast adrift in a boat before a big game, the hyperbole of Ally MacLeod, a goalkeeper swinging from the crossbar with his back to the pitch while a goal is scored, or a sequence of gormless results against teams from countries you couldn't find in an atlas with a strong magnifying glass. Whereas it is possible to watch shinty, a tough, physical and skilful game, and such activities as caber tossing with real admiration, there are some of us who find it difficult to watch the football without clutching our tummies while tears of mirth drip merrily from our chins. Which is precisely why I will be watching Scotland's match against France next Wednesday. Nationally the obsession is to beat England, which is a classic case of aiming low. Domestically the game revolves around the Old Firm battle, a four-times-a-season re-enactment of the Battle of the Boyne on the banks of the Clyde. I say this at the risk of being slit open with a skean-dhu on my next venture north of Hadrian's Wall because in Scotland, it seems, there are a lot of people who take football very seriously indeed. The place, in fact, is fitba' daft. I know this because I have just disinterred my nose from We'll Support You Evermore, which will be re-published next week. It is a ribald read, a heartfelt collection of reminiscences about games, after-match celebrations and growing up in the streets of Glasgow. This gem was first published 24 years ago after a friendly pub argument between our own Ian Archer and Trevor Royle, then the literary director of the Scottish Arts Council. Archer argued that football correspondents made the best writers on football; Royle said novelists were better. So here they are combined. Royle said yesterday: \"The book was a sell-out and was due to be reprinted in 1978. But Scotland fared so badly in the World Cup in Argentina, with bad results against Peru and Iran, that the idea was dropped.\" Here, novelists such as Alan Sharp and Gordon Williams vie with journos such as Archer, John Rafferty and Hugh Taylor to capture the essence of Scottish football. Royle's own favourite is the piece by Williams, who wrote the Hazel television series with Terry Venables, writing as a drunk-as-a-skunk Scotland supporter going home by bus after a victory over England. \"Excuse me, Missus, is this the right bus for my house? I'm saying, is this the richt bus fur ma hoose, Mrs McFlannel? Non comprendey? Come on, you crabbit auld devil, give us a song and I'll give ye a swig. \"We'll support ye evermore. Aye, you're right, Missus, greatest wee country Goad iver put breath intae. When the first goal went in I threw a wee fella next tae me up in the air. He turned out to be English wearing a tartan rosette for safety reasons. \"They were heroes! Wee Jinkie Johnstone. I'll tell you, if you could marry men I'd have proposed to him. No want a sip, Missus? Ach well, suit yersel, sanctimonious auld psalm-singer. I'm just having a couple of lagers to wash out my mouth, mind, I'm not getting involved in another big sesh. \"I'll tell you why everybody drinks at these games, your guts are churning so bad you need to be half-bevied or you'd faint. \"Please God let us win this year.

      "body": "<p>[At Besson's request, the more usual format of half an hour of one-on-one interview then questions from the audience for the remaining 45 minutes was abandoned, and the interview consisted entirely of questions from the audience, with Richard Jobson managing proceedings. The transcript has been edited for clarity]</p> <p><strong>Question:</strong> A couple of years ago you were reported to have said you were only going to make ten feature films and now you're on eight. Is this true?</p> <p><strong>Luc Besson:</strong> I promise I will do two more.</p> <p><strong>Richard Jobson: </strong>Won't you change your mind?</p> <p><strong>LB: </strong> No, that's it. I mean come on, I'm tired! I'm exhausted just watching. (To audience) you are in the best place.</p> <p><strong>RJ: </strong>What are you going to do? Are you going to go back to being a diver?</p> <p><strong>LB: </strong>I'm still wet...no, no...I want to produce. I produce about three or four films a year. I love that because I work one hour per day. And I see the director at the end of the day and I just say: \"Oh yes, change this, and that's good, fine...\" It's great, I love that.</p> <p><strong>Q: </strong>I'm intrigued why you're only going to make 10 films only? How serious were you when you made that remark?</p> <p><strong>LB: </strong> There are a few directors that I really loved who made like five, six great movies, but are still shooting and they're not good anymore and I'm sad. I want to tell them: \"Stop, please.\" You watch everything in nature - even us, or sports people - you grow and have a lot of things to say. And then one day you just say the same thing over and over, so I think it's just natural and elegant at a certain point to say: \"I've said it already...and goodbye.\" </p> <p>In my head, the fact that I have only two more films to make is pushing me. I say: \"Oh my God, I've only got two more films so I have to say something that I really mean and I have to put it all in the last two films.\" The last two will be very good, I hope.</p> <p><strong>Q: </strong> But why 10?</p> <p><strong>LB: </strong>Because 10 is good, you know, the 10 commandments, it's good in a library - 10 DVDs...and Snow-white and the 10 Dwarfs.</p> <p><strong>Q: </strong>Can actors and actresses actually help with the writing? I remember reading the original notes for Leon and there was a lot of conflict with Natalie Portman's parents wanting things changed. Is it collaborative or do you just go in and change what you want?</p> <p><strong>RJ: </strong> So is it collaborative experience, or is Luc a fascist? </p> <p><strong>LB: </strong> I think that I am a collaborative fascist. With Natalie it was different, she was only 11-years-old and Leon was her first film. And it's about a young girl who takes guns and shoots everywhere, so her parents were very scared, they didn't know me very well. So I think that's why they were on my back for a few weeks.</p> <p>Later, the relationship was good and they trusted me so it was fine. The funny thing was Natalie. Obviously at 11 she didn't smoke, she was against it. She was already responsible. She said: \"I don't want to show kids that I am smoking.\"</p> <p>So I said: OK, what about showing them that you quit?\" She said: \"OK.\" And I said: \"But to show that you quit, you have to show that you were smoking.\" So we made this deal were we showed her smoking at the beginning and then she quit for Leon.</p> <p><strong>RJ: </strong>I remember interviewing you at the time of the film and you got really pissed off with me because I kept on at you about subject of the relationship between the Jean Reno character and Natalie's character and you said to me: \"Well it's your interpretation that there's something sexual there, it's not in the film.\" Do you still stand by that? </p> <p><strong>LB: </strong> Yes.</p> <p><strong>RJ: </strong> And is that why you felt you needed to change the film with the director's cut?</p> <p><strong>LB: </strong>No, I'm not responsible for what people think. The story is about two kids, a girl and a boy. They're both 12 years old, in their minds, and they're both lost and they love each other. And the rest is just your problem.The most important line for me in L\u00e9on is the one we've just seen where her conscience says to her \"you didn't see what it was, you saw what you wanted to see\". </p> <p>That's always the dilemma. Either you believe her or you don't. Maybe she has seen something but nobody else has seen it? You can ask yourself questions all night like: \"If God wants to stop the war why doesn't he just show up in the middle of the battlefield? \" That would be perfect. He's just shown up, he's saying: \"I'm here, don't fight.\" I think that no one would fight, everyone would be down on their knees saying \"oh my God\". </p> <p><strong>RJ: </strong>And the idea that small people can change things. Small people can become big people?</p> <p><strong>LB: </strong> It's always the small people who change things. It's never the politicians or the big guys. I mean, who pulled down the Berlin wall? It was all the people in the streets. The specialists didn't have a clue the day before. If you read the newspaper a few days before...nothing...no one was talking about it. And even the French revolution, we just said \"That's enough\", and took the king. </p> <p>The famous line about the French king was that he didn't even know what was going on. He said: \"Is it a revolt?\" And the other guy said: \"No, it's a revolution.\" The king was thinking it was nothing.</p> <p><strong>RJ: </strong>Something we've never had here.</p> <p> <strong>Q: </strong>What do you think of directors repeating themselves, and why did you feel the need to do a director's cut?</p> <p><strong>LB: </strong>Let me remember why...I was happy with the first one, it was mine, my director's cut, no one asked me to cut it. But at the same time you still have 25 minutes that nobody has seen. I think it was the beginning of the summer; in the summer France is like a desert, the people are on the beach, but there are some poor guys who stay in the cities to work, so we decided to make a long version, an extended version, to play in a just a few theatres for the people who stayed. Why are you laughing? It's true!</p> <p><strong>RJ: </strong>It's totally ridiculous.</p> <p><strong>LB: </strong>No, it's true. So we had like five screens and people loved it and sent their friends and then the Japanese called and said: \"We want the long version, please.\" </p> <p><strong>Q: </strong>Have you ever met the real Jacques Mayol? He's in London this weekend.</p> <p><strong>LB: </strong> He's in London? Yes, of course I've met him. That's the first thing I did when I wanted to make the Big Blue, I contacted him and met him in Marseille. And I said: \"I'd love to make a film about you.\"</p> <p><strong>Q: </strong> Is he quite a different person in real life from how he is portrayed in the film?</p> <p><strong>LB: </strong>I've not seen him for a few years but a big part was really inspired by him.</p> <p><strong>Q: </strong> He's at the London International Dive Show at Olympia this weekend.</p> <p><strong>RJ: </strong> (to audience member) What did you like about the Big Blue?</p> <p><strong>Q: </strong>It was very inspiring. Inspiring character. Visually, totally incredible. Amazing person, the whole sort of man association with the sea and whether that can really be embodied in a person or not. I don't know how much of a fantasy it is or whether somebody can really be like that. </p> <p><strong>RJ: </strong> He's good Luc. Why don't you go and sit there and get him up here?</p> <p> <strong>Q: </strong>Why did you decide you wanted to be a film director?</p> <p><strong>LB: </strong> Originally I wanted to be a diver and take care of dolphins, but then I had an accident and couldn't dive anymore. I was 17 and I wondered what I was going to do. You know sometimes you're in a position of risk and you feel that you can turn good or bad, or you can do all kinds of stupid things? You're 17. So I tried to concentrate on what I could do.</p> <p>So I took a piece of paper and on the left I put everything I could do, or had skills for, and all the things I couldn't do. The first line was shorter and I could see that I loved writing, I loved images, I was taking a lot of pictures. So I thought maybe movies would be good. But I thought that to really know I should go to a set. And a friend of mine knew a guy whose brother was a third assistant on a short film. It's true.</p> <p>So, I said: \"OK, let's go on the set.\" So I went on the set and the first thing that I remember is that there was this big truck outside and then I saw the cables which were like, umbilical, and you found the set by following the cables and it was like...\"wow\". And then you arrived in a room and it was full of light and I fell in love. I was living 60km from Paris in a small city. The day after I went back to see my mum and told her that I was going to make films and stop school and 'bye. And I did it! Very soon after I made a short film and it was very, very bad. I wanted to prove that I could do something, so I made a short film. That was in fact my main concern, to be able to show that I could do one. </p> <p>A very good friend of mine watched the film and said: \"Luc, there is one thing you have to learn and that is when you have nothing to say - shut up!\" So I decided not to make films any more and to be an assistant. So I started as a third and then a second and then a first. The funny thing is the farther I went, the longer I thought it would take to become a director. Because the more you know, the more you see. After two years I was thinking: \"It's going to take me ten years to be a director.\" The confidence? It came two years ago.</p> <p><strong>Q: </strong> Why did you chose to do the story of Joan of Arc?</p> <p><strong>RJ: </strong> I guess if you look at your career, it's been urban thrillers, nature films, sci-fi pictures, suddenly there you are doing a huge historical drama, an epic. Why did you choose to go into that area? </p> <p><strong>LB: </strong>I'm always guided by the characters. The character. Joan of Arc's story, it's insane. So that's maybe the relationship between the characters that we were talking about. I'm always attracted by people who are lost in their time. I think it helps us. We see this is her life and it should not be like this. I learn something from that all the time.</p> <p><strong>Q: </strong> Is there a consistency in female characterisation of the female characters in your films? From Nikita all the way through to Joan of Arc.</p> <p><strong>LB: </strong>I'm more attracted by a female character because I think that now for 30 or 40 years the image of the male actor has been as a strong man, and is most of the time about force and strength. And I'm attracted by the weakness, how they (women) can fight when they don't have that. And the ways they have to find to be able to fight for something or say something - it's richer. It's much more interesting.</p> <p><strong>RJ: </strong>Your male characters have been a lot softer too, haven't they? They haven't been typically macho, French characters.</p> <p><strong>LB: </strong>The problem I think is that I like the feminine part of the male character and the male part of the female character.</p> <p><strong>RJ: </strong>So film number nine might be a transsexual awakening?</p> <p><strong>LB: </strong> From space.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Britain's leading team of independent tax experts yesterday added weight to Gordon Brown's reputation as a believer in quiet wealth redistribution when it said that the poorest people in Britain were the biggest winners from Tuesday's Budget . The Institute for Fiscal Studies said that the new tax and benefit alterations announced in the Budget reinforced the impact of the three previous packages by targeting most of the government's help on those on low incomes while top earners had been left relatively unscathed. Although Gordon Brown said in his Budget speech that Labour's actions had helped to take 1.2m children out of poverty, the chancellor was reluctant to concede yesterday that he had embarked on a redistribution of wealth and rejected claims that his Budget was a return to the old Labour values of 20 years ago. `We are New Labour and we are pursuing New Labour policies, as everybody knows,' he told BBC Radio 2's Jimmy Young programme. However, the detailed breakdown of the Budget by the IFS showed that there has been no evidence of the Blair government's pandering to the rich, with the top 40% of earners left untouched by changes. The impact of higher stamp duty to be imposed on the purchase of luxury homes was not taken into account by the IFS in its analysis, but with the levy on a pounds 500,000 house sale due to rise by pounds 2,500 to pounds 20,000, those planning to put their properties on the market will feel the pinch. According to the IFS figures, the most important changes in the Budget were the increased support for children, worth pounds 4.35 for each child under 16 the increased generosity of the yet to be introduced children's tax credit help for people making the transition from welfare to work - including a pounds 100 jobs grant and an extension of the New Deal options to all adults support for pensioners via a 50% increase in the winter fuel allowance and the decision to increase the rate only on cigarette duties by more than the rate of inflation. The overall impact of these measures meant that the poorest tenth of the population saw their weekly income rise by 3% - worth around pounds 3 per week. The next poorest decile was the second most favoured group, seeing a gain of some 2.5% a week. The IFS said this was worth slightly more than the increase to the poorest group in cash terms. By family type, the IFS said that the biggest beneficiaries of the Budget had been a non-earning couple with no children, who would see their weekly income rise by around 4% as a result of the changes. Single parents were the next most generously treated group, with a single earner couple with children and both single pensioners and pensioner couples modest gainers. While the cut in the top rate of income tax from 83% to 40% and the reduction in the basic rate of income tax from 33% to 23% meant that high earners gained most from Conservative tax policies, the IFS said that the cumulative effect of the four Labour budgets since 1997 had been to help the poorest groups. The two deciles at the bottom of the income scale have seen by far the biggest increases in their weekly incomes with rises of more than 8%. The next two poorest groups have seen smaller increases, while the fifth, sixth and seventh income deciles have enjoyed only negligible increases as a result of Budget changes. The richest decile has seen its weekly income reduced slightly as a result of fiscal measures which have in cluded the abolition of mortgage interest relief and the married couples' allowance - as well as the introduction of new means-tested tax credits aimed at the working poor and their families. By family type, non-earning families with children have seen their weekly incomes rise by 10% while single parents have had an increase of 6%-plus.

On top of all that, the chancellor is planning a new employment tax credit which is designed to extend the principle of giving in-work support to families with children to all low-paid workers. Mr Brown admitted the government was redistributing wealth through the Budget , saying: `We're redistributing to entrepreneurs by the capital gains tax cut ...

Goldin, Nasa's administrator, told the US Senate Commerce subcommittee on space Wednesday. \"We found we were really too thin.\" </p> <p>Goldin said the agency lost many veteran engineers over those years, and there was inadequate training and mentoring for young, inexperienced workers who were hired. </p> <p>Additionally, he said, there was a failure in communication between engineers and technicians doing the work and the management personnel overseeing it. </p> <p>\"There was no good communication feedback,\" Goldin said. \"People were talking and we weren't hearing them.\" </p> <p>Sen. Bill Frist, chairman of the subcommittee, said he called the hearing to get an explanation for what he called a \"very difficult\" year for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. </p> <p>During 1999, two Nasa probes to Mars were lost without a trace; shuttle missions were delayed because of damaged or troublesome equipment; workers accidentally threw away tanks built for the International Space Station, and an urgent mission to repair the Hubble Space Telescope was required. </p> <p>\"For $14 billion a year, the American taxpayers deserve better,\" said Frist. </p> <p>Sen. John McCain said that in reports examining the 1999 problems of Nasa \"the extent of mismanagement... is very startling. Over the past year, I have continually been amazed by the reports coming out of Nasa about mission failures and program delays.\"</p> <p>In his response, Goldin said that since 1992 Nasa has launched 146 payloads valued at $18 billion and experienced only 10 failures, worth about $500 million. </p> <p>He acknowledged that Nasa had \"some severe disappointments and problems\" in 1999, but added: \"We are paying close attention to these failures, examining them, searching for root causes, and recommending changes.\" </p> <p>One reason for the problems, said Goldin, is a change in the culture at Nasa. Whereas once the agency mounted only a few missions at great expense, it is now emphasizing a \"faster, better, cheaper\" philosophy that calls for more, but smaller and less costly missions. </p> <p>In earlier years, Nasa launched two planetary probes a decade, each costing billions of dollars, he said. Now the agency is sending missions to other planets each year at a fraction of the cost. </p> <p>But the new management philosophy does have flaws, including stressed, overworked employees who lack the experience or the time to do jobs properly, said Goldin. </p> <p>\"Somehow, it is not working,\" said Frist. </p> <p>\"I agree,\" said Goldin. </p> <p>The administrator said Nasa is in the process of hiring 2,000 new workers, establishing a formal training program for young engineers, and conducting a top-to-bottom evaluation of the space agency systems. </p> <p>Goldin was repeatedly asked about a published report that Nasa engineers knew of a rocket engine flaw in a Mars-bound probe. The report said that Nasa conducted flawed tests on ground models of the rocket engines, and then tried to cover up information about the problems. The Mars probe disappeared after firing its braking rockets while approaching the Red Planet. </p> <p>\"There are very, very great irregularities in that press report,\" said Goldin. He said the rocket problems were identified and discussed publicly a month before the mission failure. He said that engineers conducted honest tests, and that they believed the problem was solved. </p> <p>The subcommittee also asked Goldin about a press story that a report critical of the agency was being withheld until it could be evaluated by the White House. </p> <p>Goldin denied this, saying that the report will be released next week. He said the report has not been changed by Nasa and that the White House is not involved.</p>",

Whereas once the agency mounted only a few missions at great expense, it is now emphasizing a \"faster, better, cheaper\" philosophy that calls for more, but smaller and less costly missions. In earlier years, Nasa launched two planetary probes a decade, each costing billions of dollars, he said. Now the agency is sending missions to other planets each year at a fraction of the cost. But the new management philosophy does have flaws, including stressed, overworked employees who lack the experience or the time to do jobs properly, said Goldin. \"Somehow, it is not working,\" said Frist. \"I agree,\" said Goldin. The administrator said Nasa is in the process of hiring 2,000 new workers, establishing a formal training program for young engineers, and conducting a top-to-bottom evaluation of the space agency systems. Goldin was repeatedly asked about a published report that Nasa engineers knew of a rocket engine flaw in a Mars-bound probe. The report said that Nasa conducted flawed tests on ground models of the rocket engines, and then tried to cover up information about the problems. The Mars probe disappeared after firing its braking rockets while approaching the Red Planet. \"There are very, very great irregularities in that press report,\" said Goldin. He said the rocket problems were identified and discussed publicly a month before the mission failure. He said that engineers conducted honest tests, and that they believed the problem was solved. The subcommittee also asked Goldin about a press story that a report critical of the agency was being withheld until it could be evaluated by the White House. Goldin denied this, saying that the report will be released next week. He said the report has not been changed by Nasa and that the White House is not involved.",

      "body": "<p><a href=\"http://www.lastminute.com\">Lastminute.com</a> is currently worth \u00a3481m - well down on the \u00a3845m it was worth last week, but still a healthy figure. Well done Martha Lane Fox and the other one who's a bloke so doesn't get his picture in the paper much. You've done really brilliantly, both of you (and if you're reading, Martha, I wondered if you'd be interested in marrying me?). Lastminute.com must be pretty good, to be worth all that money. So let's give it a go... </p> <p>OK, so this is the home page and here's a guided tour, which seems like a good idea. \"Our Mission!\" declares that \"Lastminute.com encourages spontaneous, romantic and sometimes adventurous behaviour by offering people the chance to live their dreams at unbeatable prices! If you're the kind of person who likes to seize the day, this is the place to seize it!\" Yep, that's me. \"Everything on the site has been carefully selected by our experts, who make sure that everything we offer is excellent and great value - so at the last minute, the prices drop but the quality doesn't!\" Good news, and I guess we'll just have to get used to every sentence ending with an exclamation mark! </p> <p>Now I'm ready to buy something, cinema tickets perhaps. Ah, here's Magnolia with Tom Cruise: \"Exclusive screenings for one week only. Click here! See Magnolia before anybody else in the UK for one week only. This is a lastminute.com exclusive!\" </p> <p>OK, so Friday, 8pm would be good, Go for it! First, I need to register. No problem, pick a password . . . watch the spinning wheel . . . event details . . . one ticket . . . spinning wheel. \u00a39. </p> <p>I wonder if there are any additional charges; better check with Live Customer Service. But Natasha, Alex, Dan, Louisa, Nicky, Richard and Wavinya are all answering other callers; I'll be told when one is free. Now Alex is free and apologises for the delay though, to be fair, I didn't wait very long. There aren't any additional charges to the \u00a39 if I'm collecting the ticket at the cinema, says Alex. I've got my credit card in my hand, I'll go ahead with it then. Buy now! </p> <p>Oh dear. \"Security Failure. A secure connection could not be established.\" I'm not given the choice to continue and am still ticketless, after 17 minutes - though of course a lot of that was because I was new to Lastminute.com, having to register and speak to Alex. And the security failure was the probably the fault of the computer system, so it would be unfair to blame Martha and the other bloke personally. But still, 17 minutes to not buy a ticket . . . </p> <p>A call to the cinema produces a ticket in three-and-a-half minutes for the same screening (what was all that about it being a Lastminute.com exclusive then?). It cost \u00a39.78 with the booking charge so Lastminute.com was cheaper - or would have been had I been able to get a ticket. </p> <p>I'm not going to give up though. Let's have a browse around the site. \"Do you really want to impress?\" I think I do. Here's a nice-looking island for rent in Sri Lanka: $500 a day - I don't think Guardian expenses would run to that. I need something cheaper, something for the garden perhaps. </p> <p>A lazy frog, \"a cool amphibian addition to any garden\" is \u00a319.99. Perfect: go for it! \"We are sorry the product you are looking for has just been sold to another eager customer. Don't worry we have lots of other cool stuff.\" Oh no you don't - the Christmas Geese (\u00a3135), the brass cranes (\u00a3225), the frog duet (\u00a329.95), the large ratten reindeer (\u00a334), the perfect plant protector (\u00a339.99), the mini greenhouse (\u00a3295), the hen and chick set (\u00a3149), the reclining cat (\u00a384.99) have all just been sold to another eager customer. Only the flowering keyring (\u00a314.95) and the ornamental stone balls (\u00a374) are available, and I don't much fancy either. </p> <p>I decide to design and send myself a birthday card instead. It won't let me change the picture, but that's OK, I'll run with tulips. I like tulips. It does let me write my own message: \"Happy Birthday. Hope it's a good one.\" I fill out the form, credit card still ready . . . No, nothing doing. It doesn't let me send it. And nothing happens when I press the help button. The \"spontaneous behaviour\" I can feel coming on isn't the sort Martha and her friend had in mind in that mission statement. </p> <p> Perhaps I need a break from all this non-purchasing. Here's a celebrity interview to read, Jenny Frost, singer in the band Precious. Oh that Jenny Frost. Her favourite designer is G Armarni and no, spelling isn't listed as one of her hobbies. But I'm not here to criticise Lastminute.com's spelling or fondness for exclamation marks. I'm here to find out if it's any good. </p> <p>Flights then. Lastminute.com is famous for its flights. Let's try New York next weekend, coming back a week later. The fare is \u00a3174 - not bad, and a bloke called Harry congratulates me on my choice and wishes me a brilliant vacation. Thanks Harry, but I'm actually going for a funeral. Well, I might have been, for all you know. </p> <p>Let's go a little further afield - Quito on April 8 for three weeks. A business class ticket is all they come up with: \u00a31,823. That's hardly living my dreams at unbeatable prices is it? Condor Travel on 020 7373 8477 on the other hand can get me there and back with Avianca on the same dates for \u00a3369. Economy class of course, but \u00a31,454 cheaper than Lastminute.com's best offer. </p> <p>Sydney, on May 15, produces this response: \"Sorry, even working at the speed of light we couldn't find any thing that meets your exact needs.\" As does Alicante and Venice on May 15, and Johannesburg on May 1. Perhaps this is all a little too far in the future; this is Lastminute.com after all. </p> <p>But I need to do something on lastminute.com. Here we go, adopt an otter for \u00a322. Now a big-eyed whiskered face is staring out of my screen - how could I not. Go for it! \"We are sorry the product you are looking for has just been sold to another eager customer . . .\" No! Another eager customer has just that minute adopted Hector, Hector's twin sister Cally, Buckie, Glen with his injured leg, and Sushi, the young smooth-coated otter from India (funny name for an Indian otter, Sushi; I wonder what they call Japanese otters? Papadom? Or Tarka Dhal possibly). </p> <p>Right, that's enough. In my three sessions on lastminute.com I've failed to buy cinema tickets or send myself a birthday card. I've been unimpressed by the range of things for my garden, the calibre of celebratory interview, and the over-use of exclamation marks. I've found cheaper flights at the end of a phone, and although I've fallen for an Indian otter, I am unable to help her. Lastminute.com? Lastminute.con more like. (Obviously none of this in any way affects that marriage proposal, Martha). </p> <p><strong>Why it's often better to do it yourself</strong></p> <p> <strong> FLIGHTS:</strong> return fare to Sydney. </p> <p><strong> Lastminute:</strong> \u00a3702.44, (minimum stay of seven nights). </p> <p><strong> Bucket shop:</strong> Avian Travel International (0171 793 8900), \u00a3540 with Japan Airlines - no minimum or maximum stay - or \u00a3501 with Creative Tours, official agent for Japan Airlines (0171 495 1775), coming back before July 30. </p> <p><strong> FLOWERS</strong> </p> <p><strong> Lastminute:</strong> \u00a352.50 for the Elizabethan Rose Posy - \"If you like roses the old-fashioned way this Elizabeth Rose Posy could be the one\". </p> <p><strong> Branching Out, agents for Interflora (01628 666687): </strong> \u00a355.50 gets you 25 red roses but they are prepared to negotiate a bit to compete with Lastminute prices. Plus \u00a34.50 \"transmission fee\". </p> <p><strong> HOTELS</strong> </p> <p>Four Seasons, Canary Wharf, London. <strong> Lastminute: </strong> \u00a3228.13 for a double. </p> <p><strong> Directly through the hotel:</strong> \u00a3235 including free bottle of champagne and car-parking. </p> <p><strong> ENTERTAINMENT</strong> </p> <p>Copenhagen at The Duchess Theatre, London. </p> <p><strong> Lastminute: </strong> \u00a334.50. </p> <p><strong> Duchess Theatre:</strong> \u00a330. </p> <p><strong> By credit card through the Stoll-Moss Group:</strong> \u00a331. </p> <p><strong> RESTAURANTS</strong> </p> <p>La Tante Claire, Knightsbridge (\"Delightfully extravagant and terrifyingly hard to get into,\" according to Lastminute). </p> <p><strong> Lastminute: </strong> No tables available for the following night. </p> <p>A call to the restaurant got a table for two at 9pm the following evening.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Lastminute.com is currently worth \u00a3481m - well down on the \u00a3845m it was worth last week, but still a healthy figure. Well done Martha Lane Fox and the other one who's a bloke so doesn't get his picture in the paper much. You've done really brilliantly, both of you (and if you're reading, Martha, I wondered if you'd be interested in marrying me?). Lastminute.com must be pretty good, to be worth all that money. So let's give it a go... OK, so this is the home page and here's a guided tour, which seems like a good idea. \"Our Mission!\" declares that \"Lastminute.com encourages spontaneous, romantic and sometimes adventurous behaviour by offering people the chance to live their dreams at unbeatable prices! If you're the kind of person who likes to seize the day, this is the place to seize it!\" Yep, that's me. \"Everything on the site has been carefully selected by our experts, who make sure that everything we offer is excellent and great value - so at the last minute, the prices drop but the quality doesn't!\" Good news, and I guess we'll just have to get used to every sentence ending with an exclamation mark! Now I'm ready to buy something, cinema tickets perhaps. Ah, here's Magnolia with Tom Cruise: \"Exclusive screenings for one week only. Click here! See Magnolia before anybody else in the UK for one week only. This is a lastminute.com exclusive!\" OK, so Friday, 8pm would be good, Go for it! First, I need to register. No problem, pick a password . . . watch the spinning wheel . . . event details . . . one ticket . . . spinning wheel. \u00a39. I wonder if there are any additional charges; better check with Live Customer Service. But Natasha, Alex, Dan, Louisa, Nicky, Richard and Wavinya are all answering other callers; I'll be told when one is free. Now Alex is free and apologises for the delay though, to be fair, I didn't wait very long. There aren't any additional charges to the \u00a39 if I'm collecting the ticket at the cinema, says Alex. I've got my credit card in my hand, I'll go ahead with it then. Buy now! Oh dear. \"Security Failure. A secure connection could not be established.\" I'm not given the choice to continue and am still ticketless, after 17 minutes - though of course a lot of that was because I was new to Lastminute.com, having to register and speak to Alex. And the security failure was the probably the fault of the computer system, so it would be unfair to blame Martha and the other bloke personally. But still, 17 minutes to not buy a ticket . . . A call to the cinema produces a ticket in three-and-a-half minutes for the same screening (what was all that about it being a Lastminute.com exclusive then?). It cost \u00a39.78 with the booking charge so Lastminute.com was cheaper - or would have been had I been able to get a ticket. I'm not going to give up though. Let's have a browse around the site. \"Do you really want to impress?\" I think I do. Here's a nice-looking island for rent in Sri Lanka: $500 a day - I don't think Guardian expenses would run to that. I need something cheaper, something for the garden perhaps. A lazy frog, \"a cool amphibian addition to any garden\" is \u00a319.99. Perfect: go for it! \"We are sorry the product you are looking for has just been sold to another eager customer. Don't worry we have lots of other cool stuff.\" Oh no you don't - the Christmas Geese (\u00a3135), the brass cranes (\u00a3225), the frog duet (\u00a329.95), the large ratten reindeer (\u00a334), the perfect plant protector (\u00a339.99), the mini greenhouse (\u00a3295), the hen and chick set (\u00a3149), the reclining cat (\u00a384.99) have all just been sold to another eager customer. Only the flowering keyring (\u00a314.95) and the ornamental stone balls (\u00a374) are available, and I don't much fancy either. I decide to design and send myself a birthday card instead. It won't let me change the picture, but that's OK, I'll run with tulips. I like tulips. It does let me write my own message: \"Happy Birthday. Hope it's a good one.\" I fill out the form, credit card still ready . . . No, nothing doing. It doesn't let me send it. And nothing happens when I press the help button. The \"spontaneous behaviour\" I can feel coming on isn't the sort Martha and her friend had in mind in that mission statement. Perhaps I need a break from all this non-purchasing. Here's a celebrity interview to read, Jenny Frost, singer in the band Precious. Oh that Jenny Frost. Her favourite designer is G Armarni and no, spelling isn't listed as one of her hobbies. But I'm not here to criticise Lastminute.com's spelling or fondness for exclamation marks. I'm here to find out if it's any good. Flights then. Lastminute.com is famous for its flights. Let's try New York next weekend, coming back a week later. The fare is \u00a3174 - not bad, and a bloke called Harry congratulates me on my choice and wishes me a brilliant vacation. Thanks Harry, but I'm actually going for a funeral. Well, I might have been, for all you know. Let's go a little further afield - Quito on April 8 for three weeks. A business class ticket is all they come up with: \u00a31,823. That's hardly living my dreams at unbeatable prices is it? Condor Travel on 020 7373 8477 on the other hand can get me there and back with Avianca on the same dates for \u00a3369. Economy class of course, but \u00a31,454 cheaper than Lastminute.com's best offer. Sydney, on May 15, produces this response: \"Sorry, even working at the speed of light we couldn't find any thing that meets your exact needs.\" As does Alicante and Venice on May 15, and Johannesburg on May 1. Perhaps this is all a little too far in the future; this is Lastminute.com after all. But I need to do something on lastminute.com. Here we go, adopt an otter for \u00a322. Now a big-eyed whiskered face is staring out of my screen - how could I not. Go for it! \"We are sorry the product you are looking for has just been sold to another eager customer . . .\" No! Another eager customer has just that minute adopted Hector, Hector's twin sister Cally, Buckie, Glen with his injured leg, and Sushi, the young smooth-coated otter from India (funny name for an Indian otter, Sushi; I wonder what they call Japanese otters? Papadom? Or Tarka Dhal possibly). Right, that's enough. In my three sessions on lastminute.com I've failed to buy cinema tickets or send myself a birthday card. I've been unimpressed by the range of things for my garden, the calibre of celebratory interview, and the over-use of exclamation marks. I've found cheaper flights at the end of a phone, and although I've fallen for an Indian otter, I am unable to help her. Lastminute.com? Lastminute.con more like. (Obviously none of this in any way affects that marriage proposal, Martha). Why it's often better to do it yourself FLIGHTS: return fare to Sydney. Lastminute: \u00a3702.44, (minimum stay of seven nights). Bucket shop: Avian Travel International (0171 793 8900), \u00a3540 with Japan Airlines - no minimum or maximum stay - or \u00a3501 with Creative Tours, official agent for Japan Airlines (0171 495 1775), coming back before July 30. FLOWERS Lastminute: \u00a352.50 for the Elizabethan Rose Posy - \"If you like roses the old-fashioned way this Elizabeth Rose Posy could be the one\". Branching Out, agents for Interflora (01628 666687): \u00a355.50 gets you 25 red roses but they are prepared to negotiate a bit to compete with Lastminute prices. Plus \u00a34.50 \"transmission fee\". HOTELS Four Seasons, Canary Wharf, London. Lastminute: \u00a3228.13 for a double. Directly through the hotel: \u00a3235 including free bottle of champagne and car-parking. ENTERTAINMENT Copenhagen at The Duchess Theatre, London. Lastminute: \u00a334.50. Duchess Theatre: \u00a330. By credit card through the Stoll-Moss Group: \u00a331. RESTAURANTS La Tante Claire, Knightsbridge (\"Delightfully extravagant and terrifyingly hard to get into,\" according to Lastminute). Lastminute: No tables available for the following night. A call to the restaurant got a table for two at 9pm the following evening.",

The company is pretty open about its motives. \"We want to build community software for all sorts of groups. A busy queer community portal will be an excellent showcase for that,\" says Bram Heerink, one of the founders. </p> <p> Whereas communities for gay men are mostly for profit, those exclusively for dykes are not. A well known, huge and wonderfully designed German portal, Dykesworld.de (1995), not to be confused with the UK Dykeworld, is the brainchild of Indina Beuche, a desktop publishing specialist of 41 who doesn't want to make a penny from it, out of \"love and respect for the global dyke community\". As cyberspace is now awash with global communities oozing love and respect, even her authentic support sounds suspect. </p> <p> Community portals are praised by their grass roots organisations for their good works: making coming out easier, offering a smooth ride through hundreds of webpages, ploughing money back into the real-world community through sponsorships, and raising the visibility of gays and lesbians by sitting at the table with venture capitalists and blue chip organisations like Marks &amp; Spencer, who were never associated with the gay and lesbian community before. By embracing everything gay and lesbian on the net (except hard core porn), they attract clicks as fast as possible and hope for world domination. Is that great or is that simply greed?</p> <p>Gays wallow in a wonderland to check out Irish jokes here and offers of gentle kissing in a Soho fumoir there with their own gay visa card at hand. Political issues do seem to lose credibility in a banner-plastered context. Or would gays take Peter Tatchell just as seriously if he stormed Canterbury cathedral wearing a T-shirt with a Bank of Scotland logo? In commercial communities, gays are offered the alluring possibility of being connected to an enormous range of likeminded people. With such huge numbers of members however, the gay community becomes a commodity. </p> <p><strong>Addresses</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.planetout.com\" target=\"_new\">www.planetout.com</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.gay.com\" target=\"_new\">www.gay.com</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.eurogay.co.uk\" target=\"_new\">www.eurogay.co.uk</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.sonow.net\" target=\"_new\">www.sonow.net</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.rainbownetwork.com\" target=\"_new\">www.rainbownetwork.com</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.queerlondon.com\" target=\"_new\">www.queerlondon.com</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.queer.nl\" target=\"_new\">www.queer.nl</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.dykesworld.de\" target=\"_new\">www.dykesworld.de</a></p>",

The company is pretty open about its motives. \"We want to build community software for all sorts of groups. A busy queer community portal will be an excellent showcase for that,\" says Bram Heerink, one of the founders. Whereas communities for gay men are mostly for profit, those exclusively for dykes are not. A well known, huge and wonderfully designed German portal, Dykesworld.de (1995), not to be confused with the UK Dykeworld, is the brainchild of Indina Beuche, a desktop publishing specialist of 41 who doesn't want to make a penny from it, out of \"love and respect for the global dyke community\". As cyberspace is now awash with global communities oozing love and respect, even her authentic support sounds suspect. Community portals are praised by their grass roots organisations for their good works: making coming out easier, offering a smooth ride through hundreds of webpages, ploughing money back into the real-world community through sponsorships, and raising the visibility of gays and lesbians by sitting at the table with venture capitalists and blue chip organisations like Marks &amp; Spencer, who were never associated with the gay and lesbian community before. By embracing everything gay and lesbian on the net (except hard core porn), they attract clicks as fast as possible and hope for world domination. Is that great or is that simply greed? Gays wallow in a wonderland to check out Irish jokes here and offers of gentle kissing in a Soho fumoir there with their own gay visa card at hand. Political issues do seem to lose credibility in a banner-plastered context. Or would gays take Peter Tatchell just as seriously if he stormed Canterbury cathedral wearing a T-shirt with a Bank of Scotland logo? In commercial communities, gays are offered the alluring possibility of being connected to an enormous range of likeminded people. With such huge numbers of members however, the gay community becomes a commodity.

His deputy in the Northern Ireland assembly, Seamus Mallon, declared that the Ulster Unionist party (UUP) had to decide whether it was in favour of the Good Friday agreement.

A decision on a further contract also worth around \u00a36bn is due in August. </p> <p>In an interview with the New York Times, Mr Richardson said he had ordered his department to send a team to England to meet British investigators to discuss the falsified documents and nuclear inspectors' reports demanding safety improvements at BNFL's main plant in Cumbria. </p> <p>\"We are now placing BNFL under extra scrutiny because of these problems,\" he said. \"I have been uneasy about some of their operations in the US.

One was awarded without competitive tender. </p> <p>A coalition of American groups that has been pressing the US energy deparment for years to clean up its old weapons facilities plan to file a petition with the department today urging that BNFL be barred from government contracts, for lack of integrity and competence. \"We think clearly a case can be made, and that the case is self-evident, that this is a company that does not possess those qualities,\" said Thomas Carpenter, a lawyer with the government accountability project in Seattle. </p> <p>No evidence of wrongdoing has been found in BNFL's American operations and director David Bonser yesterday said BNFL's problems were caused by five workers in Cumbria who had falsified documents. </p> <p>Criticism of company management by the UK nuclear safety watchdog, the nuclear installations inspectorate, has however already cost the chief executive, John Taylor, his job. </p> <p>The latest blow comes as Japan is demanding that plutonium fuel sent there with falsified documentation should be returned to Sellafield. Britain would have to send armed ships to collect it. </p> <p>Last month Germany suspended fuel shipments to its own reactors after finding that fuel already loaded into one of its plants also had false documents. The nuclear installations inspectorate is appearing before MEPs at the European parliament today to answer questions about the company's record.</p>",

Concerns about safety lapses at former military sites in the US have been heightened in recent weeks by the fact that BNFL - the main contractor brought in to clean them up - is also perceived to have a bad management record. There is also criticism because four officials from the Department of Energy involved in awarding BNFL three separate contracts had since joined the company as executives. One was awarded without competitive tender. A coalition of American groups that has been pressing the US energy deparment for years to clean up its old weapons facilities plan to file a petition with the department today urging that BNFL be barred from government contracts, for lack of integrity and competence. \"We think clearly a case can be made, and that the case is self-evident, that this is a company that does not possess those qualities,\" said Thomas Carpenter, a lawyer with the government accountability project in Seattle. No evidence of wrongdoing has been found in BNFL's American operations and director David Bonser yesterday said BNFL's problems were caused by five workers in Cumbria who had falsified documents. Criticism of company management by the UK nuclear safety watchdog, the nuclear installations inspectorate, has however already cost the chief executive, John Taylor, his job. The latest blow comes as Japan is demanding that plutonium fuel sent there with falsified documentation should be returned to Sellafield. Britain would have to send armed ships to collect it. Last month Germany suspended fuel shipments to its own reactors after finding that fuel already loaded into one of its plants also had false documents. The nuclear installations inspectorate is appearing before MEPs at the European parliament today to answer questions about the company's record.",

      "body": "<p><strong>Q: </strong>When did you know that you had become a good director?</p> <p><strong>LB: </strong>Not through the press. I don't know if I'm a good director. You realise that you progress but you progress from your own point of view. I can see now that it's much easier for me to work with the actors, I'm much more confident and I feel better. I go further with them. Camera also, I'm not scared of the camera anymore. The [?] editing system gives you much greater opportunities and time. It fits well with me. And then piece by piece you watch your film over a few months and then you say: \"This one is better.\" It doesn't mean that people like it better, but I know that for me my last film (Joan of Arc) is the best work I've done.</p> <p><strong>RJ: </strong>In what sense? Technically, story-telling, working with the actors?</p> <p><strong>LB: </strong> Everything. Working with the actors, story-telling, the complexity of it all. To take the people one way for half of the film and then to switch to, like: \"I believe the sword was a sign.\" And to realise that it's just a point of view and to twist everything and see how she (Joan) has to pay for that. It's difficult to follow through five months of shooting, you need to really concentrate.</p> <p><strong>RJ: </strong> Does that sometimes get in the way of your story-telling, the sheer epic nature of the films you've made in recent years? From The Fifth Element to Joan of Arc, these are big, big films.</p> <p><strong>LB: </strong>No, on Joan, I was concentrating for five months. That's why people sometimes said: \"He's very hard on people.\" But the problem is that you can't smile for five months because you now when you shoot one shot to a certain level of emotion and rhythm and then you have to link that to another one on the film that will be the next second but in real time it could be two or three days. It's very difficult to remember to have the feeling of it unless you really are with it all the time.</p> <p><strong>RJ: </strong>Is that why it's sometimes easier to do a film that isn't wrapped up in so much emotion? It's much more of an action film or a comedy action film where you don't have to link those kind of emotions.</p> <p><strong>LB: </strong>Yes, it's much easier. Action is the easy part. Battle is fun, it's easy. </p> <p><strong>RJ: </strong>When you arrived on the scene your own country didn't take to you probably as well as this country did. Critically, I mean - the public certainly did. Why do you think that was?</p> <p><strong>LB: </strong>The films are made for people, so who cares really what the critics say?</p> <p><strong>RJ: </strong>You came at a time when there was a very rich intellectual backdrop to French film making, or at least that's the way it communicated itself to the rest of the world.</p> <p><strong>LB: </strong> It's always very funny - these people tell you what you should do. \"Oh, this is not the type of film for him.\" I don't understand, I just don't get it. What I love is when people go to a theatre and there are six movies and they say: \"I want to go to this one.\" And that's it. And if they don't see yours it's because they don't want to, that's fine.</p> <p>And the thing is, if they chose your film, then I feel guilty because I'm scared, I want to them to come out and say: \"Yes it was good. Cool.\" That's my responsibility, I don't want to disappoint the people who come. A critic is whatever he's paid to say.</p> <p><strong>Q: </strong>What attracted you to the script of Nil By Mouth?</p> <p><strong>LB: </strong>Well, I've worked with Gary (Oldman) twice and I love him -</p> <p><strong>RJ: </strong>Luc Besson was the executive producer on Gary Oldman's directorial debut Nil By Mouth.</p> <p><strong>LB: </strong>I really like him a lot as an actor and you can see and tell on the set that he has the skill and the eye of a director. You can feel it. Not all the actors have it. But with Gary you can tell, he's here, he's watching everything and you can feel that. And then when he said to me: \"I want to do a film, I want to direct,\" and I said: \"Yes.\" Even before we'd discussed the subject of Nil By Mouth I was very proud to produce whatever it was, just for the pleasure of seeing him. That's why I helped him. Then afterwards I got the script, but it didn't change anything. </p> <p><strong>RJ: </strong>What do you think of the story? </p> <p><strong>LB: </strong> It's hard. What I like about the way he made it is sometimes you think it's improvised or caught, just like that, but then I was standing on the deluge and I watched this take and I thought: \"Ah, the actor's just doing something instant,\" but then the take after he did exactly the same thing. And I said: \"OK, you caught me. He's an actor!\" He (Oldman) did a wonderful job for a first film. The film is difficult to go all around the world because it's very dark and difficult but he can be very proud of his film.</p> <p><strong>Q: </strong>When you're shooting a scene, do you think of music that might work with it? </p> <p><strong>LB: </strong> Most of the time, yes. Usually I take one CD and I always have the same CD in my CD player and I put it on every morning because it gives you the rhythm and then you go back to the same rhythm. So I get tired, after a while, of the CD. It's not necessarily a good CD it's just a feeling, but that's a good link to have.</p> <p><strong>Q: </strong>So does the CD tend to inspire the shooting when you listen to the music?</p> <p><strong>LB: </strong> Yes, it inspires, but also helps in the rhythm of everything, to go back to the same place every day. And you have the music of the film . And then after, when we start to edit the scene and it's made a little better I listen to a lot of music. And then if I pick up something I like we give it a try and if it fits then we edit the scene again, with the music. And we go to see Eric Serra (music arranger) and we put him in a shed because now we have something perfect but it can't be used yet- he has to do something else to it. So he hates me! That's how we work.</p> <p><strong>Q: </strong>Would you consider casting an unknown again as you did with Natalie Portman in L\u00e9on?</p> <p><strong>LB: </strong>Do you mean by \"unknown\" someone who has never played before, or someone who is an actor but who has never been in a film? </p> <p><strong>Q: </strong> Someone who has never played before.</p> <p><strong>LB: </strong> There are always people in my film who've never played before, who are not actors, always. Always five, 10 or 12, and you can't tell which ones. It depends. It can't be big. Sometimes you see a guy with a face and you think: \"Oh that face is great,\" so you give him a part. For those of you who have seen Joan of Arc for example, the two English guys who come at the beginning - </p> <p><strong>RJ: </strong>The big ugly ones, you mean?</p> <p><strong>LB: </strong> The guys that come at the beginning and want to rape her (Joan's) sister. The one at the front is an actor, the two at the back are not. I sent someone to Scotland to every stadium where they play rugby and she took pictures of all the ugly ones. So I picked one, who was great, and this man was so sweet, he took his bus from his village with his pre-paid ticket, he'd never been on a plane before, landed in Paris and he put the costume on - he was great this guy. When he shook your hand you'd think he had seven fingers, his hands were very big.</p> <p> <strong>Q: </strong>What are your feelings about the state of the British film industry?</p> <p><strong>LB: </strong> I think you're very lucky, in one way, because your language is international so you have an open door to lots of countries like the US or Canada or South Africa and that's a big advantage that we don't have. You can feel the energy. The British never give up, you've always got actors coming, and stories and things. </p> <p>From my point of view, from France, it's a good example, in fact it's probably the best example in Europe. We have lots of good people but we spend a lot of time complaining - it's very French. If you do something that works, people hate you and if you do something very intellectual everybody will cry for you. It's strange, I think you're much more united. We see good films coming from here. Lots of good actors. I've worked with a lot of British actors and their level is ten times better than the French.</p> <p><strong>RJ: </strong> Why?</p> <p><strong>LB: </strong>You can feel that they watched TV, they went to the theatre, when they come on the set. Those three guys who played in Joan of Arc, the three captains that you saw in the scene, that was their first day shooting. They arrived in the middle of 1500 guys, in costume. I talked with them; I had 13 cameras so I didn't have a lot of time. They were like so cool. Do you want a funny story about them? </p> <p>The three English were on the top of the wall, so I explained the scene and said: \"Pretend that there is a camera on you all the time.\" So they said: \"Great, OK.\" When you watched the beginning of the take they are really in, and it's great. The first few guys who arrive on the ladders are French stuntmen or actors, so they pretend and its great. After a few minutes the Czech stuntmen come in and they just go, and you can see on the tape that the English guys are looking a little worried that these guys are going to massacre them. You can feel the difference. At the end of the tape they look really scared.</p> <p> <strong>Q: </strong> What was the inspiration behind Atlantis and did you expect the audience to have a knowledge of underwater sea life?</p> <p><strong>LB: </strong> On the version you have seen do you have credits at the end with all the animals one by one and their names? Because I did that.</p> <p><strong>Q: </strong>I'd like to know if the lizard was actually in the sea or if you put it there for the film?</p> <p><strong>LB: </strong> Everything was real. Six hundred dives, two years, everything is real. There are no tricks. None. And why it inspired me? At the end of Big Blue I was kind of frustrated because we were always in the blue and there is so much life in it and I wanted to show that. And it was funny to show that the life came from the sea and not just life but everything we learnt came from the sea. In the first 10 minutes you are a human being watching animals but by the end of the film you feel like a fish. And you feel home.</p> <p><strong>Q: </strong> How did you go about feeding the sharks in order to get the photographs?</p> <p><strong>LB: </strong>It's the only way to attract them in fact, so you put some blood in the water every ten minutes for two days and as soon as they cross the ribbon of blood they come back and they come and visit you and then they stay. There were four Great White sharks. The problem was that the cage was too close and the camera was too big so you couldn't film through it, you had to get out. And you had someone on your back like this, holding you, just in case. We put a kind of lead on the camera - it was expensive and I didn't want him to go away with it. A few times they grabbed the camera. </p> <p>There was one lens which had a hole 1cm deep from the teeth. But they are nice. They always have the same speed, they're not vicious at all. They're so old, like a million years and they are the kings. The White Tips are more impressive - they're smaller, only two or three metres, but there are 100 of them there. And we had no cage so that is why it was more impressive. And I put ten kilos of meat all around the camera. </p> <p><strong>RJ: </strong>Jacques Cousteau was a smash hit in this country. Was he a big influence on you when you were a kid?</p> <p><strong>LB: </strong> When I was a kid, yes. And then Big Blue came and he said: \"This is bullshit,\" and then Atlantis came and he said: \"I won't see it.\" So I don't know, maybe he thinks that I am going to buy a red hat and take his place.</p> <p> <strong>Q: </strong>Why are you making films in English? Is it for the big bucks? At the start you made several films in French and since L\u00e9on they've all been made in English for the international market.</p> <p><strong>LB: </strong> That's not true, because Big Blue was in English, and right after I made Nikita in French. </p> <p><strong>Q: </strong> When you made it in French it played in the art houses.</p> <p><strong>LB: </strong>And then, after Nikita, I made Atlantis, which is in bubbles.</p> <p><strong>RJ: </strong>But are they French bubbles or are they English bubbles? That is the question.</p> <p><strong>LB: </strong>No, honestly, I don't care. It depends on the story. With Joan of Arc, the reality is that she was speaking a dialect from Lorraine, half of France was speaking English at this time - north of the Loire they had been speaking English for eighty years. South of the Loire they were speaking Old French and she was speaking Lorraine. And why English? Because most of the actors I wanted to work with, the good ones, spoke English. Milla (Jovovich) was perfect for the part and as you know she speaks English, so I made the film in English. </p> <p><strong>Q: </strong>Carrying on with the idea of Joan of Arc being your best film and your first being your worst. Subway was one of my favourite films. I was just wondering what the film before that, The Last Battle, is about and where you can watch it?</p> <p><strong>RJ: </strong>The Last Battle has been actually part of the season here at the NFT. You can buy it - there's an American DVD available now.</p> <p><strong>LB: </strong>They're on sale, do you want some?</p> <p><strong>RJ: </strong>What do you think of the Last Battle now? </p> <p><strong>LB: </strong>It's my first baby, I love it. It's great. </p> <p> <strong>RJ: </strong>You've said that The Fifth Element has been in your head since you were 16, how did you get it out of your head and on to the screen?</p> <p><strong>LB: </strong>It's pretty common really. I was living 65km from Paris and 11km from the nearest city with no theatres and no TV at home, I had just my little moped. So if I wanted to do the 11km, if the wind was against me it took me half an hour, so you know what, you create another world.</p> <p><strong>Q: </strong> What are you doing just now?</p> <p><strong>LB: </strong>I don't want to shoot right now.</p> <p><strong>RJ: </strong>You're doing the follow-up to Taxi right now.</p> <p><strong>LB: </strong> The next two films I'm doing are two that I produce, not direct. Taxi 2 will be in five days in France.</p> <p><strong>RJ: </strong>Have you written anything that you would like to shoot? </p> <p><strong>LB: </strong>No.</p> <p><strong>Q: </strong>Like you, I have swum with dolphins. Will you be returning to nature and the sea after your film-making career ends with number ten?</p> <p><strong>LB: </strong>You know, sometimes there are two attitudes. You see the most wonderful place in the world, with perfect beaches, and you say: \"Wow, I'm going to build a hotel here.\" Or, you're just going to shut your mouth and go there once in a while. I'm so jealous of the freedom of the dolphins. They really are the kings of the sea. The way they integrate, because as you know they are not fish, they are mammals, they are strangers in the sea. </p> <p>It's true as soon as fish sees a dolphin, they're scared to death. But they respect the environment totally - they totally integrate. They eat, they play, they make love and that's it. They don't build anything, they don't need anything and they're happy. The spend their time playing. And I'm very happy when I go over there once every two years or so - I know where they are, the wild ones - and I go swimming with them. I love this appointment with them. But that's it. I don't want to build a hotel and I'm so happy for them. </p> <p><strong>Q: </strong>Is the death of Joan of Arc's sister at the hands of the English based on true fact?</p> <p><strong>LB: </strong> Not really. The reality is that her sister died but no-one knows how. Some historians say that maybe she was killed during an attack so it could have happened in fact. We know that some members of the family were raped and killed in an attack on the village so a few elements are true. The film would be four hours long if we took all the real details so we tried to say something wrong but with an idea of the truth of it. It's delicate but that's why movies are made.</p> <p><strong>RJ: </strong> It would be quite interesting to ask the audience, since I presume most of them are English, what they think of Luc's representation of the English in Joan of Arc as vicious thugs, lunatics, hoodlums and drunkards who go over to France and go over to France and cause lots of problems. It's unthinkable isn't it? </p> <p><strong>LB:</strong> I'm not well parked, and I've got to go.</p>",

And why it inspired me? At the end of Big Blue I was kind of frustrated because we were always in the blue and there is so much life in it and I wanted to show that. And it was funny to show that the life came from the sea and not just life but everything we learnt came from the sea. In the first 10 minutes you are a human being watching animals but by the end of the film you feel like a fish. And you feel home. Q: How did you go about feeding the sharks in order to get the photographs? LB: It's the only way to attract them in fact, so you put some blood in the water every ten minutes for two days and as soon as they cross the ribbon of blood they come back and they come and visit you and then they stay. There were four Great White sharks. The problem was that the cage was too close and the camera was too big so you couldn't film through it, you had to get out. And you had someone on your back like this, holding you, just in case. We put a kind of lead on the camera - it was expensive and I didn't want him to go away with it. A few times they grabbed the camera. There was one lens which had a hole 1cm deep from the teeth. But they are nice. They always have the same speed, they're not vicious at all. They're so old, like a million years and they are the kings. The White Tips are more impressive - they're smaller, only two or three metres, but there are 100 of them there. And we had no cage so that is why it was more impressive. And I put ten kilos of meat all around the camera. RJ: Jacques Cousteau was a smash hit in this country. Was he a big influence on you when you were a kid? LB: When I was a kid, yes. And then Big Blue came and he said: \"This is bullshit,\" and then Atlantis came and he said: \"I won't see it.\" So I don't know, maybe he thinks that I am going to buy a red hat and take his place. Q: Why are you making films in English? Is it for the big bucks? At the start you made several films in French and since L\u00e9on they've all been made in English for the international market. LB: That's not true, because Big Blue was in English, and right after I made Nikita in French. Q: When you made it in French it played in the art houses. LB: And then, after Nikita, I made Atlantis, which is in bubbles. RJ: But are they French bubbles or are they English bubbles? That is the question. LB: No, honestly, I don't care. It depends on the story. With Joan of Arc, the reality is that she was speaking a dialect from Lorraine, half of France was speaking English at this time - north of the Loire they had been speaking English for eighty years. South of the Loire they were speaking Old French and she was speaking Lorraine. And why English? Because most of the actors I wanted to work with, the good ones, spoke English. Milla (Jovovich) was perfect for the part and as you know she speaks English, so I made the film in English. Q: Carrying on with the idea of Joan of Arc being your best film and your first being your worst. Subway was one of my favourite films. I was just wondering what the film before that, The Last Battle, is about and where you can watch it? RJ: The Last Battle has been actually part of the season here at the NFT. You can buy it - there's an American DVD available now. LB: They're on sale, do you want some? RJ: What do you think of the Last Battle now? LB: It's my first baby, I love it. It's great. RJ: You've said that The Fifth Element has been in your head since you were 16, how did you get it out of your head and on to the screen? LB: It's pretty common really. I was living 65km from Paris and 11km from the nearest city with no theatres and no TV at home, I had just my little moped. So if I wanted to do the 11km, if the wind was against me it took me half an hour, so you know what, you create another world. Q: What are you doing just now? LB: I don't want to shoot right now. RJ: You're doing the follow-up to Taxi right now. LB: The next two films I'm doing are two that I produce, not direct. Taxi 2 will be in five days in France. RJ: Have you written anything that you would like to shoot? LB: No. Q: Like you, I have swum with dolphins. Will you be returning to nature and the sea after your film-making career ends with number ten? LB: You know, sometimes there are two attitudes. You see the most wonderful place in the world, with perfect beaches, and you say: \"Wow, I'm going to build a hotel here.\" Or, you're just going to shut your mouth and go there once in a while. I'm so jealous of the freedom of the dolphins. They really are the kings of the sea. The way they integrate, because as you know they are not fish, they are mammals, they are strangers in the sea. It's true as soon as fish sees a dolphin, they're scared to death. But they respect the environment totally - they totally integrate. They eat, they play, they make love and that's it. They don't build anything, they don't need anything and they're happy. The spend their time playing. And I'm very happy when I go over there once every two years or so - I know where they are, the wild ones - and I go swimming with them. I love this appointment with them. But that's it. I don't want to build a hotel and I'm so happy for them. Q: Is the death of Joan of Arc's sister at the hands of the English based on true fact? LB: Not really. The reality is that her sister died but no-one knows how. Some historians say that maybe she was killed during an attack so it could have happened in fact. We know that some members of the family were raped and killed in an attack on the village so a few elements are true. The film would be four hours long if we took all the real details so we tried to say something wrong but with an idea of the truth of it. It's delicate but that's why movies are made. RJ: It would be quite interesting to ask the audience, since I presume most of them are English, what they think of Luc's representation of the English in Joan of Arc as vicious thugs, lunatics, hoodlums and drunkards who go over to France and go over to France and cause lots of problems. It's unthinkable isn't it? LB: I'm not well parked, and I've got to go.",

For days officials have been hailing the Pope as a man who has done more than any of his predecessors to heal the rift between Jews and Catholics, and have portrayed his visit as a sign of the Vatican's friendship with the Jewish state. \"I do not see anything new in the Vatican position,\" said Shlomo Ben Ami, the public security minister, who is responsible for the huge police operation during the Pope's stay here. \"We will not look at the petty details of the visit through a microscope.\" In Deheishe, where the Pope's reception was a ragged version of a state welcome from a country which has yet to be born, the muddled versions of his speech that spread through the narrow lanes had an electrifying effect. \"He is only one man but one billion people believe in him, and now he is our hero too,\" said Ali Khalaf, an engineering student. By late afternoon, when the papal cavalcade arrived waving the Palestinian tricolour, and amid the competing blare of brass bands and folk choirs, it was like a carnival. Thousands strained against the barricades for a glimpse of their new champion, many wearing t-shirts made for the occasion showing the Pope in intimate conversation with their leader, Yasser Arafat. \"There is an atmosphere of appreciation spreading through the camp because he mentioned our suffering,\" said Amjad Abu Laban, one of the organisers of the visit to Deheishe. The Pope rewarded them - and nearly 3m other Palestinians dispersed in camps across the Middle East - with a speech that was an even harsher indictment of the Israeli authorities than his morning address. \"You have been deprived of many things that represent the basic needs of human persons: proper housing, healthcare, education and work. Above all, you bear the sad memory of what you were forced to leave behind, not just material possessions, but your freedom, the closeness of relatives and the familiar surroundings and cultural traditions which nourished your personal and family life.\" There was more. \"The degrading conditions in which refugees often have to live, the continuation over long periods of situations that are barely tolerable in emergencies or for a brief time of transit; the fact that displaced persons are obliged to remain for years in settlement camps: these are the measure of the urgent need for a just solution to the underlying causes of the problem.\" In political terms, the two speeches - which invoked UN resolutions calling on Israel to end its occupation over territories captured during the 1967 war and to allow the Palestinians to return to their homes - could hardly be more explicit. They are bound to reverberate on the remainder of his six-day pilgrimage, which is to be spent entirely in Israel. They could also carry over to the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations which resumed in Washington this week, and which have seen only 40% of the West Bank turned over to Palestinian control in a slow and grudging carve-up. But there was no mistaking the significance of such a strong expression of sympathy for the Palestinian cause. \"By highlighting our situation, the Pope is helping to rebalance the equation in the Arab-Israeli problem,\" said Mr Abu Laben. As the Pope made evident, that imbalance also infects talks taking place in Washington, where Palestinian negotiators are struggling to assert their claim to a part of Jerusalem. \"Only with a just and lasting peace - not imposed but secured through negotiation - will the legitimate Palestinian aspirations be fulfilled. \"Only then will the Holy Land see the possibility of a bright new future.\" Useful links Palestinian National Authority The Vatican",

The <a href=\"http://cgi.amazing.com/david/portfolio/watts-towers/\" target=\"_NEW\"> Watts Towers</a>, probably Los Angeles's most eccentric landmarks, are to be restored as part of a regeneration drive for the city's turbulent suburb of <a href=\"http://www.wattsfestival.org/1999/festivalmap.htm\" target=\"_NEW\">Watts</a>.</p> <p>2. The towers, which bear a strange resemblance to <a href=\"http://www.gaudi.tm/ingles/i_vida/i_menu.html\" target=\"_NEW\">Antoni Gaud\u00ed</a>'s <a href=\"http://www.gaudi.tm/ingles/i_vida/fotobras/park/guell001.jpg\" target=\"_NEW\">Parc Guell</a> and <a href=\"http://www.greatbuildings.com/cgi-bin/gbi.cgi/Sagrada_Familia.html/cid_3131090.gbi\" target=\"_NEW\">Sagrada Familia</a> in distant Barcelona, were built entirely of waste material, and are the work of one man, an Italian immigrant named Simon Rodia.</p> <p>3. Restoration work will coincide with the <a href=\"http://www.dems2000.com/\" target=\"_NEW\">Democrat party convention</a> to be held in LA, for the first time in 40 years, this August. An invitation to inspect the structures will be sent to the <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov\" target=\"_NEW\">White House</a> once the project is complete.</p> <p>4. Condemned as structural hazards by the city council, the towers were saved by Watts residents, and are now registered as a <a href=\"http://www.cal-parks.ca.gov/DISTRICTS/angeles/wtsrshp518.htm\" target=\"_NEW\">state historic park</a>.</p> <p>5. They are an important focus of identity for the area, still scarred by the <a href=\"http://www.usc.edu/isd/archives/la/watts.html\" target=\"_NEW\">Watts riots</a> of August 1965, which left 34 dead, and the suburb in ruins. The towers were unscathed.</p> <p>6. Certainly, they are an improvement on the other defining landmarks of the City of Angels - <a href=\"http://disney.go.com/disneyland/\" target=\"_NEW\">Disneyland</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.itlnet.com/main/holywood.html\" target=\"_NEW\">Hollywood</a> sign.</p> <p>7. Today, although the demography of the area is changing in favour of the Latino population, the <a href=\"http://www.wattsfestival.org/main/history.htm\" target=\"_NEW\">Watts summer festival</a> is still a focus for black solidarity in Los Angeles.

The towers, which bear a strange resemblance to Antoni Gaud\u00ed's Parc Guell and Sagrada Familia in distant Barcelona, were built entirely of waste material, and are the work of one man, an Italian immigrant named Simon Rodia. 3. Restoration work will coincide with the Democrat party convention to be held in LA, for the first time in 40 years, this August. An invitation to inspect the structures will be sent to the White House once the project is complete. 4. Condemned as structural hazards by the city council, the towers were saved by Watts residents, and are now registered as a state historic park. 5. They are an important focus of identity for the area, still scarred by the Watts riots of August 1965, which left 34 dead, and the suburb in ruins. The towers were unscathed. 6. Certainly, they are an improvement on the other defining landmarks of the City of Angels - Disneyland and the Hollywood sign. 7. Today, although the demography of the area is changing in favour of the Latino population, the Watts summer festival is still a focus for black solidarity in Los Angeles. The festival's director, Tommy Jacquette, condemns the regeneration plan as an attempt to create a white-friendly \"Hollywatts\". 8. In Britain, the tradition of the architectural folly is well established. But this kind of maverick art is surprisingly widespread; witness Nek Chand's rock gardens in Chandigarh, India. 9. It is hoped that the towers will become a major tourist attraction. There is, after all, no reason why a tower built by rank amateurs and repeatedly condemned as structurally unsound shouldn't draw visitors. (Ask Pisa city council.) 10.

The dismissal of Fernando Couto for a second yellow, following an outrageous lunge on Tore Andre Flo, offered scant consolation. </p> <p>Chelsea's cause was not helped by the absence of their captain Dennis Wise to injury; nor by the fact that Lazio's position in the group brought them into last night's tie seeking victory. </p> <p>Attacking from the start is not Lazio's normal game, but the Italians set about their unaccustomed task with energy and imagination - plus an unhealthy amount of play-acting. The referee Victor Manuel Melo Pereira was in danger of losing control long before he allowed Matias Almeyda to escape without a caution for a late lunge at Flo on 22 minutes. </p> <p>The fact that Frank Leboeuf was booked for a blatant overreaction to being pushed by Couto shortly after did little to excuse Lazio's cynicism. His yellow card means he will now miss the opening leg of the quarter-final. </p> <p>Without Wise's ability in midfield, Chelsea found themselves overrun and outmanoeuvred. With the sublimely gifted Juan Veron creating particular menace, Ed de Goey was regularly called on to keep Chelsea in the game. </p> <p>After just three minutes the Dutchman produced a reaction punch away when Simone Inzaghi fired a volley goalwards. Three minutes later De Goey again did well to hold out a Veron shot that bounced just in front of him. Dejan Stankovic followed that with a header just over the bar, before De Goey was forced to dart from his line to interrupt Inzaghi's breakaway. </p> <p>Chelsea eked out a few chances of their own. Luca Marchegiani pushed away Gianfranco Zola's left-foot shot on the turn and Flo flicked a cross just wide, before seeing another strike cleared off the line by Sinisa Mihajlovic. </p> <p>But they were in dangerous territory until a minute before the break, when a Poyet special gave them some much-needed breathing space. Bringing the ball forward, Chelsea's captain for the night - playing his 100th game for the club - unleashed a high-powered strike from 25 yards which bent from left to right and beat Marchegiani into the top corner. </p> <p>It was no surprise when Lazio brought on Alen Boksic as a straight striking partner for Inzaghi in a 4-4-2 formation, and the reshuffle paid immediate dividends. Two minutes after the restart Boksic dispossessed a dawdling Desailly in the Chelsea area only to fire wide. Seconds later Boksic was again unmarked in a scoring position, but his shot skewed wide again. </p> <p>However, Chelsea's comfort was shortlived. On 54 minutes Leboeuf lost possession midway in his own half and suddenly the home defence were outnumbered as Lazio broke forward. The ball came out to Pavel Nedved on the left and, though he needed two touches to control the ball, he squeezed in a cross which Inzaghi bundled over from close range. </p> <p>It was a deserved equaliser but, unfortunately for Chelsea, it signalled an extension to the nail-biting siege of De Goey's goal. And that led to Lazio taking the lead on 66 minutes. </p> <p>Babayaro gave away a free-kick wide on the right, outside Chelsea's area. Mihajlovic lined it up and uncorked an unstoppable strike which bent into the far top corner of De Goey's net. Chelsea had to settle for second. </p> <p>\u0095 Marseille's Richard Martini was sent off for a second bookable offence in the 76th minute against Feyenoord in the other Group D match, which ended 0-0. </p> <p> <strong> Chelsea</strong> (4-4-2): De Goey; Ferrer, Desailly, Leboeuf, Babayaro (Morris, ; Petrescu, Di Matteo, Deschamps, Poyet; Zola, Flo. </p> <p><strong> Lazio </strong> (4-4-1-1): Marchegiani; Negro, Couto, Mihajlovic, Pancaro; Stankovic, Almeyda, Simeone, Nedved; Veron; Inzaghi. </p> <p><strong> Referee</strong> : V Melo Pereira (Portugal).</p>",

Dejan Stankovic followed that with a header just over the bar, before De Goey was forced to dart from his line to interrupt Inzaghi's breakaway. Chelsea eked out a few chances of their own. Luca Marchegiani pushed away Gianfranco Zola's left-foot shot on the turn and Flo flicked a cross just wide, before seeing another strike cleared off the line by Sinisa Mihajlovic. But they were in dangerous territory until a minute before the break, when a Poyet special gave them some much-needed breathing space. Bringing the ball forward, Chelsea's captain for the night - playing his 100th game for the club - unleashed a high-powered strike from 25 yards which bent from left to right and beat Marchegiani into the top corner. It was no surprise when Lazio brought on Alen Boksic as a straight striking partner for Inzaghi in a 4-4-2 formation, and the reshuffle paid immediate dividends. Two minutes after the restart Boksic dispossessed a dawdling Desailly in the Chelsea area only to fire wide. Seconds later Boksic was again unmarked in a scoring position, but his shot skewed wide again. However, Chelsea's comfort was shortlived. On 54 minutes Leboeuf lost possession midway in his own half and suddenly the home defence were outnumbered as Lazio broke forward. The ball came out to Pavel Nedved on the left and, though he needed two touches to control the ball, he squeezed in a cross which Inzaghi bundled over from close range. It was a deserved equaliser but, unfortunately for Chelsea, it signalled an extension to the nail-biting siege of De Goey's goal. And that led to Lazio taking the lead on 66 minutes. Babayaro gave away a free-kick wide on the right, outside Chelsea's area. Mihajlovic lined it up and uncorked an unstoppable strike which bent into the far top corner of De Goey's net. Chelsea had to settle for second. \u0095 Marseille's Richard Martini was sent off for a second bookable offence in the 76th minute against Feyenoord in the other Group D match, which ended 0-0. Chelsea (4-4-2): De Goey; Ferrer, Desailly, Leboeuf, Babayaro (Morris, ; Petrescu, Di Matteo, Deschamps, Poyet; Zola, Flo. Lazio (4-4-1-1): Marchegiani; Negro, Couto, Mihajlovic, Pancaro; Stankovic, Almeyda, Simeone, Nedved; Veron; Inzaghi. Referee : V Melo Pereira (Portugal).",

      "body": "<p>If the headlines are to be believed, starting a business on the internet goes something like this: you have a great idea for a site, you are rich enough to be able to quit your job, and technically advanced enough to build your own site before a venture capitalist invests a few million quid for a 10% equity stake. At this point the papers start writing about you, people visit your site in droves and you float on the stock market for \u00a3200m. </p> <p>For those of us living in the real world, it's a bit more like this: you have a great idea for a site. You get hold of some software from a net magazine's free CD and have a go at building your own site. You work harder than you've ever done in your life... and no one visits your site. Certainly not an investor. </p> <p>So how can someone without useful parents and the right degree make a business work on the web? First of all you need to resign yourself to the fact that it will be harder and take longer than you first thought. </p> <p>But that doesn't mean it's impossible to build an empire from your bedroom. The first - and most important - thing is make sure that your idea is as robust as it can be. Spend time brainstorming to make sure it really is as brilliant as you originally thought. Identify every possible revenue stream and work out how to exploit them. </p> <p>This is essential if your site is ever going to make serious money as no investor will take you on unless you can demonstrate that your idea holds the keys to the bank's vaults. You also have to make sure that you can provide your site with all the love and attention it needs: you need to supply the content - be it text on pruning roses or the best deals on discounted goods - and be able to build and manage the site and the associated business (fulfilling orders etc). </p> <p>You will also need time - every entrepreneur you meet will tell you how hard they work - and the support of the people around you. </p> <p>Let's assume your idea is absolutely brilliant and you know that if you could just get the ear of an investment consultant at 3i, the money would be in the bank by the end of the week. But as you have no contacts and no track record, sadly, the best way to get investment is to show that you can do it without investment. </p> <p>It's sod's law, but it's true. You have to build your own site as best you can and find a way of showing that your idea works in the real world, as well as in your head. </p> <p>If your idea is too complex to build without funding, focus on one aspect of the business you can build and that gives enough of an idea to investors of the full picture. It's possible to build a site with free software from magazine covers and downloads from the net. A good place to start is <a href=\"http://www.netmag.co.uk/software/\">www.netmag.co.uk/software/default.asp</a> which supplies free software from .net magazine, but paying for a user-friendly Wysiwyg (what you see is what you get) programme like Dreamweaver or Go Live might be a smart investment (you can download free trial versions). </p> <p> Building a site takes time and is incredibly frustrating, but you will learn so much and understand your business so much better for persevering. If you need to call in a professional designer, do as you would for a decorator: go by recommendation. </p> <p>You can get your site hosted for free by your internet service provider (eg Demon or Freeserve), but shop around for a hosting service that will put you on a good server (ie one that will allow your site to download quickly). It should also offer good technical support - vital if you're a small team without good technical skills. It's also worth shopping around the domain registry sites, try <a href=\"http://www.netnames.co.uk\">www.netnames.co.uk</a> or <a href=\"http://www.uk2.net\">www.uk2.net</a> to get the best deal on a good, memorable URL. (uniform resource locator). </p> <p>Now tell people about your site. Networking is the most important thing you can do. Tell the postman, tell the other people in the queue at the supermarket - tell absolutely everyone you can think of. Join a networking group like <a href=\"http://www.firsttuesday.com/\" target=\"_new\">FirstTuesday</a>, Surfs Up or Boobnight and find out what other people are doing, see if they can help out, or if you can help them. Make allies and as many introductions as you can. Evangelise about your site and convert everyone you meet. If you don't do it, no one else will. There is a good networking tradition in the internet and investors will expect you to make the most of the opportunities it can provide. </p> <p>You also need to tell your potential users about the site and - as everyone will tell you - good marketing is the real driver of internet success. Think creatively about ways to do your marketing cheaply. Think about who your users are, where they shop, where they work, what they read and what other sites they might use. Is there another company that already targets your audience and whose contacts you could use? Or is there an event or seminar where you could hand out leaflets? </p> <p>It's a waste of your time sending press releases to the national press unless you've got a really good story for them: simply launching another site is not news to most journalists. And don't forget to use the internet. There's a lot of ambivalence about the effectiveness of banner exchanges and reciprocal links - but they are often free and if you can scratch backs with enough sites with which you have some synergy it can help get your brand and web address into circulation. </p> <p>Try to get hold of your potential users' email addresses (this is much easier if your idea is for a business-to-business application) and send them some promotional material. Make it worth their while - are there special offers you can motivate them with, or prizes you can give away? Make sure you get a good listing on the search engines. Take a look at <a href=\"http://www.searchenginewatch.com\">www.searchenginewatch.com</a> for tips on how to get a good listing and keep plugging away until you come out on top. Again, this is very frustrating but a site with a low ranking is never going to make money. </p> <p>After a few months of serious marketing, you should start to get a steady flow of traffic. Hopefully this will be enough to get some advertisers on board, but it won't be easy. The big agencies like <a href=\"http://www.247europe.com/\" target=\"_new\">24/7</a> and <a href=\"http://www.doubleclick.net:8080/uk/\" target=\"_new\">Doubleclick</a> won't be interested in you unless you have several hundred thousand page impressions a month, which means you will probably have to sell some space yourself. While the income will be nice, it will be more important for showing venture capitalists that there is a genuine appetite to advertise on your site. </p> <p>You're now ready to approach financiers. You will need a business plan that outlines your idea, that makes clear why you're the best person to do it and how much money you will need. Crucially, it must also tell investors how much money they're going to make. There are loads of websites and books that will help you do this (the links section of <a href=\"http://www.toptechnology.co.uk\">www.toptechnology.co.uk</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bvca.co.uk\">www.bvca.co.uk</a> - the Venture Capital association - are good places to start), but getting your plan noticed by a VC, incubator or business angel is another matter. </p> <p>Getting someone to make an introduction on your behalf is a big help but if you don't have the contacts, the internet is your greatest ally. Almost all investors have websites which specify the kind of businesses they're interested in, the amounts of money they invest and the names of the people to send business plans to. Even so raising finance, despite what the headlines say, is hard. For every 100 business plans read, four meetings take place and one idea gets funded. But maybe, just maybe, it will be yours. </p> <p>\u0095 Josephine Monroe, co-founder of the-bullet.com <a href=\"http://www.the-bullet.com/\" target=\"_new\">the-bullet.com</a></p>",

There's a lot of ambivalence about the effectiveness of banner exchanges and reciprocal links - but they are often free and if you can scratch backs with enough sites with which you have some synergy it can help get your brand and web address into circulation. Try to get hold of your potential users' email addresses (this is much easier if your idea is for a business-to-business application) and send them some promotional material. Make it worth their while - are there special offers you can motivate them with, or prizes you can give away? Make sure you get a good listing on the search engines. Take a look at www.searchenginewatch.com for tips on how to get a good listing and keep plugging away until you come out on top. Again, this is very frustrating but a site with a low ranking is never going to make money. After a few months of serious marketing, you should start to get a steady flow of traffic. Hopefully this will be enough to get some advertisers on board, but it won't be easy. The big agencies like 24/7 and Doubleclick won't be interested in you unless you have several hundred thousand page impressions a month, which means you will probably have to sell some space yourself. While the income will be nice, it will be more important for showing venture capitalists that there is a genuine appetite to advertise on your site. You're now ready to approach financiers. You will need a business plan that outlines your idea, that makes clear why you're the best person to do it and how much money you will need. Crucially, it must also tell investors how much money they're going to make. There are loads of websites and books that will help you do this (the links section of www.toptechnology.co.uk and www.bvca.co.uk - the Venture Capital association - are good places to start), but getting your plan noticed by a VC, incubator or business angel is another matter. Getting someone to make an introduction on your behalf is a big help but if you don't have the contacts, the internet is your greatest ally. Almost all investors have websites which specify the kind of businesses they're interested in, the amounts of money they invest and the names of the people to send business plans to. Even so raising finance, despite what the headlines say, is hard. For every 100 business plans read, four meetings take place and one idea gets funded. But maybe, just maybe, it will be yours. \u0095 Josephine Monroe, co-founder of the-bullet.com the-bullet.com",

BAC promised to contact her with a new date but two weeks later she had heard nothing and tried vainly to cancel the contract. BAC's response was written confirmation of a new installation date in January, but when the day dawned the firm denied ever having suggested it. Another date in February was confirmed by letter, then that too was cancelled and Hameed was told someone would call with an alternative.

The idea is you get a refund if you cancel within seven days of receiving the brochure. Alas, that didn't happen for JB Dewar, whose plight we reported. She has now been joined by Michael Collins of Alnwick, Northumberland, and Patrick Manning of London. Collins had to call three times before the brochure arrived and once afterwards to obtain missing pages. \"It took three weeks to arrive, so when I queried a refund I was told I was too late.\" Manning tried in vain to telephone the company as soon as his brochure arrived but found the number constantly engaged.

Studios keen to get their pictures some Oscar-winning kudos fill the pages of Screen International and Variety with over-the-top advertisements recommending films and stars \"for your consideration\". Does Davis think people are affected by this uniquely cunning ploy? </p> <p>\"Contrary to what the press sometimes likes to suggest,\" he chuckles, \"do you really think Martin Scorsese is going to look at an ad and say 'Well, this says this guy here is the best director, so I'd better vote for him'?

Imagine staging an enormously complicated Broadway show, with very little rehearsal, which goes out live all around the world and closes after one night.\" Under such conditions, Davis confesses, \"I tend not to be very good company. I obsess over time, like: 'We only gave out two awards in half an hour and now we have 18 more and three musical numbers!'\" </p> <p>But Davis's biggest problem on the night - barring a repeat of Marlon Brando's infamous 1972 dispatching of a faux-Native American squaw to pick up his award for The Godfather - must be acceptance speeches over-running (don't cry Gwyneth, it's not just you). What does he do about that? </p> <p>Ever the diplomat, he refuses to name names, but does remark that \"the unspoken rule is this - if you're saying something witty or wise, no one's going to play you off. But if you bring out a list a mile long of people you could just as easily call up on the phone, well that's not entertainment, and it's time to strike up the band!\" </p> <p>Finally, I ask him the only question that really needs answering - who's going to win then? </p> <p>\"Most people assume I know,\" he coughs, \"and it is absolutely true - that I do not. No one in the Academy, not even the president, has any idea of the winners until those envelopes are opened on stage.\" </p> <p>But he must have a personal favourite? </p> <p>\"Yes. Yes, I do. And, whatever else I'm going to do, I'm certainly, definitely not going to mention them.\" </p> <p>\u0095 The Oscars ceremony will be shown live on Monday morning from 1am on Sky Premier, plus live coverage throughout the night on <a href=\"http://www.filmunlimited.co.uk\">Film Unlimited</a>.</p>",

Meanwhile, the world at large is now all-too-familiar with the kind of mishaps which can befall Mr Oscar before his big night; the question is whether Davis and his team have contingency plans in the case of a hypothetical disaster on Sunday night itself? \"We do a lot of that,\" he acknowledges, \"from fire and flood to presenters who don't show, but that hasn't happened for many years.\" He also admits that \"it's a very paranoia-inducing process. Imagine staging an enormously complicated Broadway show, with very little rehearsal, which goes out live all around the world and closes after one night.\" Under such conditions, Davis confesses, \"I tend not to be very good company. I obsess over time, like: 'We only gave out two awards in half an hour and now we have 18 more and three musical numbers!'\" But Davis's biggest problem on the night - barring a repeat of Marlon Brando's infamous 1972 dispatching of a faux-Native American squaw to pick up his award for The Godfather - must be acceptance speeches over-running (don't cry Gwyneth, it's not just you). What does he do about that? Ever the diplomat, he refuses to name names, but does remark that \"the unspoken rule is this - if you're saying something witty or wise, no one's going to play you off. But if you bring out a list a mile long of people you could just as easily call up on the phone, well that's not entertainment, and it's time to strike up the band!\" Finally, I ask him the only question that really needs answering - who's going to win then? \"Most people assume I know,\" he coughs, \"and it is absolutely true - that I do not. No one in the Academy, not even the president, has any idea of the winners until those envelopes are opened on stage.\" But he must have a personal favourite? \"Yes. Yes, I do. And, whatever else I'm going to do, I'm certainly, definitely not going to mention them.\" \u0095 The Oscars ceremony will be shown live on Monday morning from 1am on Sky Premier, plus live coverage throughout the night on Film Unlimited.",

In short, expensive though it may be to train IT staff, their return, both direct and indirect, makes it eminently desirable to cultivate them as the cash cows of GDP. </p> <p>These were the figures announced to 150 representatives of the EC, national governments, policy makers, growth companies and ITC companies' assembled in Brussels at the summit on technology, innovation, and skills training earlier this month.

Tax breaks on equity holdings, and the simplification of pensions/NI to allow IT workers easier roaming around Europe were also listed as core elements of a future strategy. The recommendations seemed to largely find favour with those assembled, which was lucky really, since despite being billed as a summit \"to develop a call to action\" it turned out that Microsoft (the sponsor) had opted to streamline the consultation process.

George Duckworth and Arthur Wood, who did play for England, stumped him in first-class matches. And EA \"Bill\" Baker of Victoria pulled off a remarkable double in a Sheffield Shield match against South Australia at Adelaide in 1946-47: he stumped The Don in both innings. Baker was a teacher at Upwey High School outside Melbourne, and in his form at the time was Murray Hedgcock, now a distinguished sportswriter who covers events in England for The Australian newspaper. Hedgcock remembers his headmaster Bill Woodfull - himself a former Australian Test captain - announcing the latest score from the MCG to an afternoon assembly, and adding that \"Mr Baker has 17 not out\", to much applause.</p> <p> Bradman was out hit wicket only once in his entire career - in the first Test against India at Brisbane in 1947-48. He had made 185, though, before he broke his own stumps while playing one from opposing captain Lala Amarnath. And he was run out only once in Tests, by England's Jack Hobbs at Adelaide in 1928-29, after scoring 58. In all first-class matches he was only out this way four times. </p> <p> <strong>What is the highest Test score that didn't include any fours?</strong> asks Steve Telfer</p> <p>The highest individual score without a boundary is 84, by Australia's Bill Lawry, in the second innings of the first Test against England at Brisbane in 1970-71.

Openers Alan Butcher (2) and Grahame Clinton (6) both got off the mark, then there were six successive ducks on the scorecard - Surrey were 8 for 8 - before Graham Monkhouse (2) and Sylvester Clarke (4) got the remaining runs. Norbert Phillip took 6 for 4 and Neil Foster 4 for 10. Following on 273 behind Surrey easily averted defeat with 185 for 2 in their second innings: their captain, Roger Knight, now secretary of MCC, made 101 not out this time around.</p> <p> <strong>Which famous player was Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's only first-class wicket? And what was the outcome of Dennis Lillee's last ball in Test cricket?</strong> asks Rob Robinson</p> <p>Conan Doyle's only wicket was WG Grace (he later wrote a poem about it).

It was, as you'd probably expect, a one-sided affair. South Africa ran up 328 for 3 in their 50 overs, with openers Gary Kirsten (86) and Andrew Hudson (161) putting on 186.

      "body": "<p>'Usually I tell people that I woke up one morning and just decided that I wanted to write,\" says Peter Farrelly. \"But, seeing as we're here for a while, I'll give you the real version.\" </p> <p>As you'd expect from a man who created such comic spectacles as Dumb and Dumber and There's Something About Mary, Farrelly at first comes across as a bellowing hurricane of energy and gags. Suddenly, seriousness falls over his face as he explains the origins of his screen-writing career. \"When I was at high school I had a girlfriend who I was crazy about. We had our ups and downs but, to cut a long story short, she ended up falling out of a moving car while we were juniors at college. She broke her neck and died instantly. It made a big impact on me. Three years later, when I still wasn't over it, I decided that it would help if I wrote something down about her. That's how it started.\" </p> <p>It seems odd that such a tragic event would help produce movies defined by their slapstick and engagingly juvenile humour. But then, there are several things that are unlikely about Peter Farrelly. To an extent, he plays the role of comedy writer/director to perfection: at 42, he is still floppy-haired and goatee-bearded. He wears the baggy cotton clothes of a teenage skateboarder and peppers his conversation with gags as he sits cross-legged and shoeless in his London hotel room. This, presumably, is the Peter Farrelly who has his characters drink urine and electrocute dogs. Then there's the other Peter Farrelly - the one who loses eye contact with you when he speaks about the death of his girlfriend, his horrific brush with a suicide and his teenage encounter with a UFO. </p> <p>This is the Peter Farrelly who wrote The Comedy Writer, a new novel so touching, honest and cringingly believable that one can hardly believe it came from the same pen that wrote the movies. \"Ah well,\" he comments says. \"A movie is just about entertainment. Writing a book is about finding the truth. You want it to be real. When you go to a movie you're likely to sit through it unless it's really horrendous. So you've got the viewer for two hours. But if a reader is about 50 pages into a book and starts to suspect that it's a bunch of baloney, they're not going to go on. And even if they do, what have you achieved if they didn't believe it?\" </p> <p>In his quest for realism, Farrelly had his novel's hero, Henry Halloran, replicate many of his own experiences as a young man in Hollywood. The recently dumped Halloran turns his back on a dead-end sales job in Boston and moves to California with high hopes of selling a screenplay. Within days of arriving, he tries, and fails, to stop a woman jumping off the roof of a building. When he writes an article about the experience for the LA Times, he is contacted by the suicide victim's deeply strange sister, who latches on to him and hinders his bungling attempts to penetrate the film industry. </p> <p>In a sense, it's a cautionary tale for aspiring screenwriters everywhere, although Farrelly is keen to play down his own Hollywood struggles. \"I had less to lose than the character in the book,\" he points out. After his girlfriend's death, he became determined to find a focus in life. \"By the time I was 24, I remember feeling that I would have really disappointed her,\" he says. \"I was working as a salesman but I was horrible at it. I was nothing. So I started to pray every night. My prayer was: 'God, show me a sign of something I can do and that I will love.' After a while I got it into my head that if I wrote about her and my days at high school and college, I would see something that I would like to do.\" </p> <p>He soon discovered a passion for the very process of writing and took what seemed like an audacious career decision. \"Where I grew up, people didn't become writers,\" he laughs. \"In my mind, it would have been just as easy to become governor. I didn't tell anyone at first because I was embarrassed by it. When I did confess, I would walk into bars and guys I knew would shout, 'Hey, Pete! C'mere! Tell Charlie what you're going to do! Fucking Hemingway here's gonna write a book!' It was a very hard thing to defend because the odds were that it wouldn't work out.\" </p> <p>Things worked out far quicker for Farrelly than for his fictional counterpart. During his first nine years in Hollywood, he made money out of writing without actually making a movie. \"It's a lot easier to sell scripts than get them made.\" But there was one crucial similarity between Farrelly's early days in Hollywood and those of his fictional character. \"The suicide really did happen. But I had to trim it down for the book because if I told the real story no one would believe it. </p> <p>What really happened was I was walking down the street near where I worked in LA and I saw a woman on a building. I was the only person around and I managed to get her down by sending the security guard up to her. I talked to her for a while and asked if she'd like to have a cup of coffee with me. She didn't want to hear it and drove away. I took her licence plate number, called the police and told them that this woman was going to kill herself and they had to contact her family or something. They said they couldn't because it would violate her civil rights. Two days later I was walking along the same street when I saw her up on the same roof. Again, I was the only person around. As soon as I saw her, she jumped. It was too weird - I couldn't write that in a book.\" </p> <p>That ghastly coincidence is not lost on Farrelly. \"I've had a few strange things like that happen to me,\" he says. \"And because of that I'm very aware of... erm... signs.\" </p> <p>In The Comedy Writer, Henry Halloran briefly mentions that he saw a UFO when he was young. This is another of the autobiographical details. \"I did see a UFO,\" explains Farrelly. \"I've never told this before in an interview. First of all, I'd like to say that that if I hadn't seen a flying saucer, I wouldn't believe it. But I did. And I won't deny it either.\" </p> <p>Late one night in 1975, in his home state of Rhode Island, Farrelly was driving along with a friend when a huge rectangular object approached the car. \"It was about 300 yards above us,\" he remembers. \"It was huge and there were millions of lights on the bottom. It hovered down the highway and right over our car. The next day I was driving into school when there was this announcement on the radio saying that if anyone had seen a UFO, they should call this number. So I called it and said, 'Yeah, I saw it last night. What was it?' They told me they were just taking a poll. So I told a lot of friends about it and they said I should find out who the people were. So I called back about a week later and the phone number had been disconnected. At the time, and for years afterwards, I thought perhaps it was a secret government weapon. But that was 25 years ago and what I saw that night is still not on public record, so I have to believe it was some sort of UFO.\" </p> <p>The sighting has influenced Farrelly's perspective on life ever since. He believes that \"we are in prehistoric times now... there are things we have not discovered yet\". He also applies this open-mindedness to his career. \"I don't exactly believe in fate,\" he says. \"But you've got to realise that it's sometimes not so bad if you don't get what you want.\" </p> <p>Nowadays, he pretty much has everything he wants. He is married with one child and another on the way and, with his brother, Bobby, continues to create some of the biggest-grossing comedies of all time. Their latest effort, Me Myself and Irene, stars Jim Carrey and is released later this year. Unlike Henry Halloran, who allows career setbacks to crush his hope, Farrelly puts his own success largely down to a willingness to \"stick it out\" in Hollywood. Nonetheless, he insists that certain occurrences were somehow inevitable. \"Back in 1990, my brother and I tried to be staff writers on Seinfeld,\" he recalls. \"I was very annoyed that they didn't hire us because I knew we would have done a good job. But thank God they didn't! Where would I be now? Writing jokes every day of the week? I write two months per year now, and I find that hard. Things work out for a reason. At least, they have for me.\" </p> <p>\u0095 To order a copy of The Comedy Writer for \u00a37.99 (rrp \u00a39.99) plus 99p UK p&amp;p, freephone 0800 3166 102 or send orders, payable to The Guardian CultureShop, to 250 Western Avenue, London, W3 6EE.</p>",

Writing a book is about finding the truth. You want it to be real. When you go to a movie you're likely to sit through it unless it's really horrendous. So you've got the viewer for two hours. But if a reader is about 50 pages into a book and starts to suspect that it's a bunch of baloney, they're not going to go on. And even if they do, what have you achieved if they didn't believe it?\" In his quest for realism, Farrelly had his novel's hero, Henry Halloran, replicate many of his own experiences as a young man in Hollywood. The recently dumped Halloran turns his back on a dead-end sales job in Boston and moves to California with high hopes of selling a screenplay. Within days of arriving, he tries, and fails, to stop a woman jumping off the roof of a building. When he writes an article about the experience for the LA Times, he is contacted by the suicide victim's deeply strange sister, who latches on to him and hinders his bungling attempts to penetrate the film industry. In a sense, it's a cautionary tale for aspiring screenwriters everywhere, although Farrelly is keen to play down his own Hollywood struggles. \"I had less to lose than the character in the book,\" he points out. After his girlfriend's death, he became determined to find a focus in life. \"By the time I was 24, I remember feeling that I would have really disappointed her,\" he says. \"I was working as a salesman but I was horrible at it. I was nothing. So I started to pray every night. My prayer was: 'God, show me a sign of something I can do and that I will love.' After a while I got it into my head that if I wrote about her and my days at high school and college, I would see something that I would like to do.\" He soon discovered a passion for the very process of writing and took what seemed like an audacious career decision. \"Where I grew up, people didn't become writers,\" he laughs. \"In my mind, it would have been just as easy to become governor. I didn't tell anyone at first because I was embarrassed by it. When I did confess, I would walk into bars and guys I knew would shout, 'Hey, Pete! C'mere! Tell Charlie what you're going to do! Fucking Hemingway here's gonna write a book!' It was a very hard thing to defend because the odds were that it wouldn't work out.\" Things worked out far quicker for Farrelly than for his fictional counterpart. During his first nine years in Hollywood, he made money out of writing without actually making a movie. \"It's a lot easier to sell scripts than get them made.\" But there was one crucial similarity between Farrelly's early days in Hollywood and those of his fictional character. \"The suicide really did happen. But I had to trim it down for the book because if I told the real story no one would believe it. What really happened was I was walking down the street near where I worked in LA and I saw a woman on a building. I was the only person around and I managed to get her down by sending the security guard up to her. I talked to her for a while and asked if she'd like to have a cup of coffee with me. She didn't want to hear it and drove away. I took her licence plate number, called the police and told them that this woman was going to kill herself and they had to contact her family or something. They said they couldn't because it would violate her civil rights. Two days later I was walking along the same street when I saw her up on the same roof. Again, I was the only person around. As soon as I saw her, she jumped. It was too weird - I couldn't write that in a book.\" That ghastly coincidence is not lost on Farrelly. \"I've had a few strange things like that happen to me,\" he says. \"And because of that I'm very aware of... erm... signs.\" In The Comedy Writer, Henry Halloran briefly mentions that he saw a UFO when he was young. This is another of the autobiographical details. \"I did see a UFO,\" explains Farrelly. \"I've never told this before in an interview. First of all, I'd like to say that that if I hadn't seen a flying saucer, I wouldn't believe it. But I did. And I won't deny it either.\" Late one night in 1975, in his home state of Rhode Island, Farrelly was driving along with a friend when a huge rectangular object approached the car. \"It was about 300 yards above us,\" he remembers. \"It was huge and there were millions of lights on the bottom. It hovered down the highway and right over our car. The next day I was driving into school when there was this announcement on the radio saying that if anyone had seen a UFO, they should call this number. So I called it and said, 'Yeah, I saw it last night. What was it?' They told me they were just taking a poll. So I told a lot of friends about it and they said I should find out who the people were. So I called back about a week later and the phone number had been disconnected. At the time, and for years afterwards, I thought perhaps it was a secret government weapon. But that was 25 years ago and what I saw that night is still not on public record, so I have to believe it was some sort of UFO.\" The sighting has influenced Farrelly's perspective on life ever since. He believes that \"we are in prehistoric times now... there are things we have not discovered yet\". He also applies this open-mindedness to his career. \"I don't exactly believe in fate,\" he says. \"But you've got to realise that it's sometimes not so bad if you don't get what you want.\" Nowadays, he pretty much has everything he wants. He is married with one child and another on the way and, with his brother, Bobby, continues to create some of the biggest-grossing comedies of all time. Their latest effort, Me Myself and Irene, stars Jim Carrey and is released later this year. Unlike Henry Halloran, who allows career setbacks to crush his hope, Farrelly puts his own success largely down to a willingness to \"stick it out\" in Hollywood. Nonetheless, he insists that certain occurrences were somehow inevitable. \"Back in 1990, my brother and I tried to be staff writers on Seinfeld,\" he recalls. \"I was very annoyed that they didn't hire us because I knew we would have done a good job. But thank God they didn't! Where would I be now? Writing jokes every day of the week? I write two months per year now, and I find that hard. Things work out for a reason. At least, they have for me.\" \u0095 To order a copy of The Comedy Writer for \u00a37.99 (rrp \u00a39.99) plus 99p UK p&amp;p, freephone 0800 3166 102 or send orders, payable to The Guardian CultureShop, to 250 Western Avenue, London, W3 6EE.",

Suffolk Central Tory, Michael Lord, owns land in Willington near Bedford, and despite the field being home to the rare great crested grebe (whose mating dance is such a treat), Mr Lord has twice tried and failed to get permission to build 35 houses there. On Sunday, according to Theobald's news agency, Mr Lord turned up with a JCB digger, starting fires and clearing bushes. Details are sketchy, but the following all turned up at the field: around 50 local residents, fire engines, the police, Anglia Television, and the mayor of Bedford.

      "body": "<p>For many of the citizens of Zhukovsky, the town that once represented the pride of socialist Russia's aviation achievements, acting president Vladimir Putin represents the reawakening of an ill-defined sense of hope.</p> <p>Zhukovsky has endured harsh changes since the collapse of the Soviet Union a decade ago. Parts of the prestigious aviation institute - where all of Russia's prototype aircraft were once tested, and which used to be under constant CIA satellite surveillance - have been converted by entrepreneurial former scientists into a cake factory.</p> <p>Some leading rocket scientists have been forced by dwindling state funding to seek work in the building industry. Others have gone to work for a nearby chocolate plant producing Mars bars.</p> <p>As the townspeople decide how to vote in Sunday's presidential election, the privations and indignities of post-Soviet existence have attracted growing numbers of Zhukovsky's voters to Mr Putin.</p> <p>What they like is his promise to resurrect Russia as a great power - though with just three days to go until the national poll, information available to the electorate about precisely what Mr Putin proposes to do once he becomes president remains slim.</p> <p>He has published no manifesto and has set out no economic programme, nor has he explained, except in the broadest of terms, how he plans to run the country. Rather, he has assiduously avoided alienating potential voters by associating himself with precise ideologies or firm commitments.</p> <p>Instead, in an open letter to the electorate, he struck uncontentious emotive chords, stressing the need to impose law and order and to restore national dignity.</p> <p>The inherent vagueness of this electoral non-platform has paid off - winning him a universal appeal which cuts across divides of age, education and background.</p> <p>There is no sense of electoral frenzy in Zhukovsky, a hour's drive from Moscow. The only political posters on the streets are remnants from December's parliamentary elections. But without even needing to orchestrate a formal campaign, Mr Putin has already won the support of an extraordinary diversity of voters here, each of whom firmly believes him capable of achieving a range of irreconcilable feats.</p> <p>As he dealt dominoes to his colleagues in a locker room of one of the aviation institute's run-down annexes, Victor Ivanovich, 55, the building's caretaker, explained why the former KGB apparatchik would be getting his vote.</p> <p>\"He's like Stalin. He knows how to get the country into shape, and he will restore order,\" he said, slapping the dominoes on to the table with tattoed hands. \"Putin is a strong man. Only he can help us.\"</p> <p>It was not Mr Putin's authoritarianism, but his liberal instincts which appealed to Mikhail Nesterov, aged 38, a former aerodynamics academic who was forced to abandon his job when money ran out at the institute, and to turn instead to supervising apartment-block building projects.</p> <p>\"I like the fact that he's fluent in German. His mastery of a foreign language is a good sign - it suggests he's open to western, liberal ideas,\" he said.</p> <p>Yelena Paltsova, an English teacher at the town's main secondary school near by, said that she was delighted by Mr Putin's intelligence.</p> <p>\"He's an educated man who can talk without notes on any subject,\" she said. Listing the areas she believed Mr Putin planned to tackle, she added: \"He wants to cut down the country's bureaucratic apparatus, he wants to stop our money from flowing abroad and plans to develop the country's industrial strengths.</p> <p>\"He won't get caught up with the dirty money of untrustworthy business interests. Moreover, he's got support from abroad - from Tony Blair and from China.\"</p> <p>Until the 1990s, Zhukovsky was considered so sensitive to the Soviet Union's security that the town was closed to outsiders; today the local airfield still remains off-limits to foreigners. Outside its gates, Vladimir, 45, a test pilot with 20 years' experience, said that Mr Putin was the man best equipped to reinvigorate Russia's economy.</p> <p>\"Sometimes the base can't afford the fuel to get the planes in the air,\" he said. \"Conditions for workers here have got much worse. I'm entitled to retire, but with a pension of 400 roubles (\u00a310) a month and two children to feed, I can't afford to stop working. It will take a while, but I believe Putin is capable of improving things.\"</p> <p>Looking at the hazy rhetoric that has come from Mr Putin, it is hard to understand where this optimism stems from. In his open letter to the country, he laid bare the problems facing Russia, but hardly attempted to explain what he would do to resolve them.</p> <p>Instead many voters appear to have invested their hopes in him because he is a new face, untainted by the past. They have chosen to see in him only what they want to see.</p> <p>Admitting that his support for Mr Putin was at heart instinctive, Andrei, the foreman at a nearby building site, said: \"After Yeltsin, it's enough that he is young and energetic. I don't know what he plans to do with the country - we'll know that after the election. But he is the man we need.\"</p> <p>Not all of the city's residents have been won over by Mr Putin's charms, however. Some are dismayed by the lack of any realistic alternative to a man who has a lead in the polls of almost 40%. Such people are preparing to register their protest by voting against all the candidates.</p> <p>Others are alarmed by the prospect of a former spy ruling the country. Irina Samovolnova, the director of the local school for the last 21 years, admitted: \"I'm worried for the children's sake that Putin may restore the culture of the KGB. I don't want them to grow up under that system.\"</p>",

Some leading rocket scientists have been forced by dwindling state funding to seek work in the building industry. Others have gone to work for a nearby chocolate plant producing Mars bars. As the townspeople decide how to vote in Sunday's presidential election, the privations and indignities of post-Soviet existence have attracted growing numbers of Zhukovsky's voters to Mr Putin. What they like is his promise to resurrect Russia as a great power - though with just three days to go until the national poll, information available to the electorate about precisely what Mr Putin proposes to do once he becomes president remains slim. He has published no manifesto and has set out no economic programme, nor has he explained, except in the broadest of terms, how he plans to run the country. Rather, he has assiduously avoided alienating potential voters by associating himself with precise ideologies or firm commitments. Instead, in an open letter to the electorate, he struck uncontentious emotive chords, stressing the need to impose law and order and to restore national dignity. The inherent vagueness of this electoral non-platform has paid off - winning him a universal appeal which cuts across divides of age, education and background. There is no sense of electoral frenzy in Zhukovsky, a hour's drive from Moscow. The only political posters on the streets are remnants from December's parliamentary elections. But without even needing to orchestrate a formal campaign, Mr Putin has already won the support of an extraordinary diversity of voters here, each of whom firmly believes him capable of achieving a range of irreconcilable feats. As he dealt dominoes to his colleagues in a locker room of one of the aviation institute's run-down annexes, Victor Ivanovich, 55, the building's caretaker, explained why the former KGB apparatchik would be getting his vote. \"He's like Stalin. He knows how to get the country into shape, and he will restore order,\" he said, slapping the dominoes on to the table with tattoed hands. \"Putin is a strong man. Only he can help us.\" It was not Mr Putin's authoritarianism, but his liberal instincts which appealed to Mikhail Nesterov, aged 38, a former aerodynamics academic who was forced to abandon his job when money ran out at the institute, and to turn instead to supervising apartment-block building projects. \"I like the fact that he's fluent in German. His mastery of a foreign language is a good sign - it suggests he's open to western, liberal ideas,\" he said. Yelena Paltsova, an English teacher at the town's main secondary school near by, said that she was delighted by Mr Putin's intelligence. \"He's an educated man who can talk without notes on any subject,\" she said. Listing the areas she believed Mr Putin planned to tackle, she added: \"He wants to cut down the country's bureaucratic apparatus, he wants to stop our money from flowing abroad and plans to develop the country's industrial strengths. \"He won't get caught up with the dirty money of untrustworthy business interests. Moreover, he's got support from abroad - from Tony Blair and from China.\" Until the 1990s, Zhukovsky was considered so sensitive to the Soviet Union's security that the town was closed to outsiders; today the local airfield still remains off-limits to foreigners. Outside its gates, Vladimir, 45, a test pilot with 20 years' experience, said that Mr Putin was the man best equipped to reinvigorate Russia's economy. \"Sometimes the base can't afford the fuel to get the planes in the air,\" he said. \"Conditions for workers here have got much worse. I'm entitled to retire, but with a pension of 400 roubles (\u00a310) a month and two children to feed, I can't afford to stop working. It will take a while, but I believe Putin is capable of improving things.\" Looking at the hazy rhetoric that has come from Mr Putin, it is hard to understand where this optimism stems from. In his open letter to the country, he laid bare the problems facing Russia, but hardly attempted to explain what he would do to resolve them. Instead many voters appear to have invested their hopes in him because he is a new face, untainted by the past. They have chosen to see in him only what they want to see. Admitting that his support for Mr Putin was at heart instinctive, Andrei, the foreman at a nearby building site, said: \"After Yeltsin, it's enough that he is young and energetic. I don't know what he plans to do with the country - we'll know that after the election. But he is the man we need.\" Not all of the city's residents have been won over by Mr Putin's charms, however. Some are dismayed by the lack of any realistic alternative to a man who has a lead in the polls of almost 40%. Such people are preparing to register their protest by voting against all the candidates. Others are alarmed by the prospect of a former spy ruling the country. Irina Samovolnova, the director of the local school for the last 21 years, admitted: \"I'm worried for the children's sake that Putin may restore the culture of the KGB. I don't want them to grow up under that system.\"",

Capital gains tax has been slashed. The \"withholding tax\" imposed on financial corporations will be abolished. The biggest lorries - but only the biggest - will be exempted from much of the duty they now pay.</p> <p>For big business, Britain is already one of the world's most luxurious tax resorts. In 1979, corporation tax stood at 52%. After successive Conservative and Labour cuts, it has been reduced to 30%. This, Gordon Brown boasted last year, is \"now the lowest rate in the history of British corporation tax, the lowest rate of any major country in Europe and the lowest rate of any major industrialised country anywhere, including Japan and the United States\". Mr Brown claims that he wants to wage war on tax havens. But, under his guidance, Britain is becoming one of the worst.</p> <p>It is not hard to see why this is happening. More mobile than ever before, big businesses can bully governments into relieving them of their responsibilities. If a state won't cut the taxes it levies, they threaten to disinvest, and move to somewhere which will. By these means they have been able to shift the burden of taxation, worldwide, from the rich to the poor and middle- incomed. Fifty years ago, corporation taxes in the United States rendered more than 30% of federal revenues, which was more than the union received from personal taxation. Now they account for just 12%, a quarter of the amount delivered by personal tax. While the Confederation of British Industry clamours for cuts in corporate taxes, it has also lobbied against cuts in consumer taxes. It wants the money spent, instead, on public infrastructure, providing lucrative contracts for business.</p> <p>Personal taxation has not been growing evenly. The highly paid, like the corporations which employ them, are mobile, and can play one state off against another. The poor are forbidden to move, so their taxes remain as high as their weakened democracies allow. They pay their immobility tax, and reap the insecurity caused by this global race to the bottom.</p> <p>The great corporate tax rebate, in other words, mirrors the great corporate handout. Before it came to power, Labour hinted that it would stop doling out money to big business. But it reckoned without the protection racket big companies now operate in Britain, threatening to clear out and take the economy with them if they don't get what they want. Last week it gave \u00a3530m to BAe, to persuade it to build its new jet here rather than elsewhere. Some economists have suggested that the subsidies corporations receive from governments now outweigh the total tax they pay.</p> <p>Big business has further reduced its contributions by means of ingenious tax avoidance strategies. Rupert Murdoch's British holding company, Newscorp Investments, has managed to pay no net British corporation tax on the \u00a31.4bn in profits it has made since 1988. As companies move their transactions on to the internet - a shift encouraged by this week's Budget - their business will become both more opaque and even more mobile. They will install their servers where taxes are lowest, disguise their trade in goods as a trade in services, and even launch their own virtual currencies. The British inventor of one internet currency - beenz - appears to understand the implications. \"I wouldn't want to be working for the Inland Revenue when it happens,\" he says.</p> <p>The tax burden, in other words, is shifting to those who are unable to move their assets either offshore or out of the old economy and into cyberspace. While the beggar-thy-neighbour economics that Gordon Brown practises hurt rich countries, the poor are wounded still more gravely. With little else to offer, poor countries end up giving everything away in a desperate attempt to undercut their rivals and attract \"investment\". If, in other words, taxation is not to become wholly regressive all over the world, we will have to revolutionise the means by which the rich are charged.</p> <p>Some innovative schemes have been proposed. The \"Tobin tax\", for example, would penalise short-term financial speculation. If it were collected internationally, it could fund, for example, the United Nations, and pay for development and emergency programmes. War on Want calculates that a 0.25% tax would raise an annual \u00a3250bn. The \"total consumption tax\" proposed by Professor Robert Frank would exploit the gap between richer people's incomes and savings, levying steep tariffs on the purchase of luxury goods. Land taxation would make use of one of the few assets big business can't move. Some people have proposed a \"bit tax\", imposed on all electronic communications. This, though, is surely just as likely to punish the impoverished internet anorak (or, for that matter, the information-hungry Guardian columnist) as the tax-exempt corporate predator.</p> <p>But it seems to me that we need to be still bolder. Perhaps it is time to give serious consideration to the idea of a global corporation tax.</p> <p>The corporations have, so far, succeeded in globalising everything except their obligations. Their rights have been harmonised, while their responsibilities have been shed. They have ensured that international bodies such as the World Trade Organisation establish only maximum standards for corporate behaviour, rather than minimum standards. We need to turn this formula around, obliging corporations to respond to human needs. And among the measures we should force on them is a fixed rate of business tax, payable by companies wherever they trade.</p> <p>This would not be easy either to implement or to enforce. It would hand a formidable advantage to countries playing outside the rules, as corporations would flock to them just as they flock to tax havens today. But it is possible to conceive of a system of sanctions, rather like the sanctions imposed today upon countries seeking to protect their markets.</p> <p>None of this could work without the democratisation of global treaty-making: prior parliamentary approval of all national negotiating positions, for example, and referenda on important decisions. But this needs to happen anyway: corporations have been able to extract such advantages from globalisation only because they have been able to keep the public out of international decision-making. Governments will reassert their control over corporations when people reassert their control over governments.</p> <p>Global taxation will be troublesome and politically hazardous. But whether we intervene or not, corporate taxes will converge worldwide, but downwards, rather than upwards. If business is not forced to redistribute its wealth, then the rich will roam the world, free of obligations, while the rest of us will be left to support society, the state and even the corporations through an ever more onerous immobility tax.</p>",

The great corporate tax rebate, in other words, mirrors the great corporate handout. Before it came to power, Labour hinted that it would stop doling out money to big business. But it reckoned without the protection racket big companies now operate in Britain, threatening to clear out and take the economy with them if they don't get what they want. Last week it gave \u00a3530m to BAe, to persuade it to build its new jet here rather than elsewhere. Some economists have suggested that the subsidies corporations receive from governments now outweigh the total tax they pay. Big business has further reduced its contributions by means of ingenious tax avoidance strategies. Rupert Murdoch's British holding company, Newscorp Investments, has managed to pay no net British corporation tax on the \u00a31.4bn in profits it has made since 1988. As companies move their transactions on to the internet - a shift encouraged by this week's Budget - their business will become both more opaque and even more mobile. They will install their servers where taxes are lowest, disguise their trade in goods as a trade in services, and even launch their own virtual currencies. The British inventor of one internet currency - beenz - appears to understand the implications. \"I wouldn't want to be working for the Inland Revenue when it happens,\" he says. The tax burden, in other words, is shifting to those who are unable to move their assets either offshore or out of the old economy and into cyberspace. While the beggar-thy-neighbour economics that Gordon Brown practises hurt rich countries, the poor are wounded still more gravely. With little else to offer, poor countries end up giving everything away in a desperate attempt to undercut their rivals and attract \"investment\". If, in other words, taxation is not to become wholly regressive all over the world, we will have to revolutionise the means by which the rich are charged. Some innovative schemes have been proposed. The \"Tobin tax\", for example, would penalise short-term financial speculation. If it were collected internationally, it could fund, for example, the United Nations, and pay for development and emergency programmes. War on Want calculates that a 0.25% tax would raise an annual \u00a3250bn. The \"total consumption tax\" proposed by Professor Robert Frank would exploit the gap between richer people's incomes and savings, levying steep tariffs on the purchase of luxury goods. Land taxation would make use of one of the few assets big business can't move. Some people have proposed a \"bit tax\", imposed on all electronic communications. This, though, is surely just as likely to punish the impoverished internet anorak (or, for that matter, the information-hungry Guardian columnist) as the tax-exempt corporate predator. But it seems to me that we need to be still bolder. Perhaps it is time to give serious consideration to the idea of a global corporation tax. The corporations have, so far, succeeded in globalising everything except their obligations. Their rights have been harmonised, while their responsibilities have been shed. They have ensured that international bodies such as the World Trade Organisation establish only maximum standards for corporate behaviour, rather than minimum standards. We need to turn this formula around, obliging corporations to respond to human needs. And among the measures we should force on them is a fixed rate of business tax, payable by companies wherever they trade. This would not be easy either to implement or to enforce. It would hand a formidable advantage to countries playing outside the rules, as corporations would flock to them just as they flock to tax havens today. But it is possible to conceive of a system of sanctions, rather like the sanctions imposed today upon countries seeking to protect their markets. None of this could work without the democratisation of global treaty-making: prior parliamentary approval of all national negotiating positions, for example, and referenda on important decisions. But this needs to happen anyway: corporations have been able to extract such advantages from globalisation only because they have been able to keep the public out of international decision-making. Governments will reassert their control over corporations when people reassert their control over governments. Global taxation will be troublesome and politically hazardous. But whether we intervene or not, corporate taxes will converge worldwide, but downwards, rather than upwards. If business is not forced to redistribute its wealth, then the rich will roam the world, free of obligations, while the rest of us will be left to support society, the state and even the corporations through an ever more onerous immobility tax.",

      "body": "<p>There was a spring in the cabinet minister's step as he headed into the Commons yesterday to hear the prime minister deliver the second half of the Brown-Blair double whammy of the Budget's NHS cash spectacular. It may prove to be the first step to a second election triumph. </p> <p>\"What Gordon has done is force the Tories to choose between matching our spending plans or sticking to their own promise to cut taxes. They've been trying to have it both ways and were doing quite well until yesterday,\" he explained. </p> <p>A few minutes later Tony Blair made the same point with brutal clarity when he taunted William Hague with the same choice across the dispatch box: what would it be, tax cuts or extra spending on the NHS?, he repeatedly asked. </p> <p>Mr Hague later retaliated by calling the NHS statement clich\u00e9s and waffle. But Mr Blair will make his challenge again and again from here to the general election his chancellor had uppermost in his mind in Tuesday's Budget. His press spokesman, Alastair Campbell, had cleared the decks a week earlier by admitting that taxes have risen under Labour - to finance the better public services voters say they want. </p> <p><strong> Melting left-wing hearts</strong><br> </p> <p> That is now the ground on which the election will be fought. Will it be on local election day, May 3, 2001, as Foreign Office minister Keith Vaz suggested, four years on from Tony Blair's last landslide? </p> <p>Or a month later, say June 14, after pollsters have scrutinised those local results (as Margaret Thatcher did in 1983)? Or will Mr Blair wait until October so that the fruits of Mr Brown's fifth budget - the next one - have been fully appreciated by voters. When those likely tax cuts have had time to \"fructify\" in their pockets, as Norman Lamont likes to put it. </p> <p>It is easy to understand why the cabinet minister was cheerful yesterday. By its own lucky standards Labour has taken some beatings since Christmas, over the NHS and asylum, over the crisis of confidence among its \"heartland\" voters, last week over Rover cars. </p> <p>\"For one reason or another, we're unpopular in Wales and Scotland, in the north-west (over the Synchrotron research project move to Oxford), in London over the mayor and now in the West midlands over Rover,\" one former minister complained yesterday, ticking off disaffected regions on his fingers. </p> <p>But Mr Brown's description of the state of public finances must have melted the hardest leftwing heart. Even Ken Livingstone's verdict was generous yesterday (though he wished Gordon had acted sooner to relax spending). As for past Labour chancellors - Denis Healey, Roy Jenkins and Jim Callaghan are all alive and well - how they must have contrasted it with their crisis-ridden years. At this stage in both the 1964-70 and the 1974-79 Labour governments, early increases in spending were being reversed in the wake of sterling crises from which neither ever recovered. </p> <p>Yet Labour MPs, trade union leaders and party activists are not wholly euphoric. Nor are the Tories and Liberal Democrats demoralised by Tuesday's coup. Labour worries and Tory opportunities both focus on key target groups: pensioners - who had expected more and are still sore at Mr Brown's preference for targeting help rather than increasing the universal state pension; the regions, manufacturing industry, both still hurt by the high pound. </p> <p>Mr Brown said disappointingly little about all of them in his 51-minute statement. That might explain the muted atmosphere on the Labour benches despite the 35% boost he promised the NHS. Where does he go from here? </p> <p>One interpretation of the four-year NHS bounty is that it was a knee-jerk reaction to the flu epidemic during the winter that brought confidence in the service - not the NHS itself - to the brink of collapse. From this perspective, Labour had no choice but to bring forward a big part of its second comprehensive spending review once the media was full of stories about cancer operations being cancelled and patients being moved hundreds of miles across Britain in search of intensive care beds. </p> <p>The alternative view, promulgated by Treasury officials, is that, far from being a panic measure instigated by No 10, the refinancing of health had long been planned. Certainly Messrs Brown, Blair and Alan Milburn (still at the Treasury when they started the project) talked well before the prime minister sat down for breakfast with David Frost in January - and promised to match EU spending on health if the economy and NHS modernisation stayed on course. </p> <p>Instead of being a sticking-plaster job for the NHS, Gordon Brown's Budget was the start of a long government campaign intended to result in a second Labour election victory in May 2001, the fourth anniversary of Tony Blair's landslide in 1997. </p> <p>Labour strategists carefully timed the second comprehensive review for this year - even though the first three-year-programme is not even a third completed - in the belief that it would give them momentum for a prolonged reelection campaign. </p> <p><strong> City opinion divided</strong><br> </p> <p> Crucial to the entire strategy is that the economy continues to perform well. The forecasts in the Treasury's red book assume that growth will be around 3% this year, above its estimated long-run trend of 2.5%, but smack in line with the consensus view of independent economists. </p> <p>However, the driving force for Britain's expansion in 2000 will be consumer demand, with exports depressed by the strong pound and a current account deficit at levels not seen since the ill-fated Lawson boom of the late 80s. The main risk to the chancellor's rosy scenario is that buoyant demand spills over into higher inflation, forcing the Bank of England into aggressive increases in interest rates. </p> <p>City opinion is divided on this issue. The doves believe rates will not go much higher, perhaps only to 6.5%, while the hawks see the ceiling as being 7.5%.

      "bodyText": "There was a spring in the cabinet minister's step as he headed into the Commons yesterday to hear the prime minister deliver the second half of the Brown-Blair double whammy of the Budget's NHS cash spectacular. It may prove to be the first step to a second election triumph. \"What Gordon has done is force the Tories to choose between matching our spending plans or sticking to their own promise to cut taxes. They've been trying to have it both ways and were doing quite well until yesterday,\" he explained. A few minutes later Tony Blair made the same point with brutal clarity when he taunted William Hague with the same choice across the dispatch box: what would it be, tax cuts or extra spending on the NHS?, he repeatedly asked. Mr Hague later retaliated by calling the NHS statement clich\u00e9s and waffle. But Mr Blair will make his challenge again and again from here to the general election his chancellor had uppermost in his mind in Tuesday's Budget. His press spokesman, Alastair Campbell, had cleared the decks a week earlier by admitting that taxes have risen under Labour - to finance the better public services voters say they want. Melting left-wing hearts That is now the ground on which the election will be fought. Will it be on local election day, May 3, 2001, as Foreign Office minister Keith Vaz suggested, four years on from Tony Blair's last landslide? Or a month later, say June 14, after pollsters have scrutinised those local results (as Margaret Thatcher did in 1983)? Or will Mr Blair wait until October so that the fruits of Mr Brown's fifth budget - the next one - have been fully appreciated by voters. When those likely tax cuts have had time to \"fructify\" in their pockets, as Norman Lamont likes to put it. It is easy to understand why the cabinet minister was cheerful yesterday. By its own lucky standards Labour has taken some beatings since Christmas, over the NHS and asylum, over the crisis of confidence among its \"heartland\" voters, last week over Rover cars. \"For one reason or another, we're unpopular in Wales and Scotland, in the north-west (over the Synchrotron research project move to Oxford), in London over the mayor and now in the West midlands over Rover,\" one former minister complained yesterday, ticking off disaffected regions on his fingers. But Mr Brown's description of the state of public finances must have melted the hardest leftwing heart. Even Ken Livingstone's verdict was generous yesterday (though he wished Gordon had acted sooner to relax spending). As for past Labour chancellors - Denis Healey, Roy Jenkins and Jim Callaghan are all alive and well - how they must have contrasted it with their crisis-ridden years. At this stage in both the 1964-70 and the 1974-79 Labour governments, early increases in spending were being reversed in the wake of sterling crises from which neither ever recovered. Yet Labour MPs, trade union leaders and party activists are not wholly euphoric. Nor are the Tories and Liberal Democrats demoralised by Tuesday's coup. Labour worries and Tory opportunities both focus on key target groups: pensioners - who had expected more and are still sore at Mr Brown's preference for targeting help rather than increasing the universal state pension; the regions, manufacturing industry, both still hurt by the high pound. Mr Brown said disappointingly little about all of them in his 51-minute statement. That might explain the muted atmosphere on the Labour benches despite the 35% boost he promised the NHS. Where does he go from here? One interpretation of the four-year NHS bounty is that it was a knee-jerk reaction to the flu epidemic during the winter that brought confidence in the service - not the NHS itself - to the brink of collapse. From this perspective, Labour had no choice but to bring forward a big part of its second comprehensive spending review once the media was full of stories about cancer operations being cancelled and patients being moved hundreds of miles across Britain in search of intensive care beds. The alternative view, promulgated by Treasury officials, is that, far from being a panic measure instigated by No 10, the refinancing of health had long been planned. Certainly Messrs Brown, Blair and Alan Milburn (still at the Treasury when they started the project) talked well before the prime minister sat down for breakfast with David Frost in January - and promised to match EU spending on health if the economy and NHS modernisation stayed on course. Instead of being a sticking-plaster job for the NHS, Gordon Brown's Budget was the start of a long government campaign intended to result in a second Labour election victory in May 2001, the fourth anniversary of Tony Blair's landslide in 1997. Labour strategists carefully timed the second comprehensive review for this year - even though the first three-year-programme is not even a third completed - in the belief that it would give them momentum for a prolonged reelection campaign. City opinion divided Crucial to the entire strategy is that the economy continues to perform well. The forecasts in the Treasury's red book assume that growth will be around 3% this year, above its estimated long-run trend of 2.5%, but smack in line with the consensus view of independent economists. However, the driving force for Britain's expansion in 2000 will be consumer demand, with exports depressed by the strong pound and a current account deficit at levels not seen since the ill-fated Lawson boom of the late 80s. The main risk to the chancellor's rosy scenario is that buoyant demand spills over into higher inflation, forcing the Bank of England into aggressive increases in interest rates. City opinion is divided on this issue. The doves believe rates will not go much higher, perhaps only to 6.5%, while the hawks see the ceiling as being 7.5%. The latter would not be helpful for the Blair-Brown masterplan, since keeping Middle England sweet would not be made any easier by sharply rising mortgage payments in the run-up to an election. One of the reasons for modest Tory cheer this week is that next month voters will feel the loss of mortgage tax relief and married couples allowance in their pay packets - the result of last year's budget. Its impact will be felt days before this year's local elections on May 4, when Mr Livingstone also looks all but certain to become mayor of London.

Like Tony Blair, Margaret Thatcher made her initial intervention in a January television interview. Like Tony Blair, she was horrified by the wide variations in performance in different parts of the country. Like Tony Blair, she set up a review. But that is where the similarities between the two reviews end. </p> <p>There are three obvious differences. The current health crisis does not compare with the \"bankruptcy\" facing the service in 1987. Next, unlike Margaret Thatcher, Tony Blair signalled yesterday he would be consulting widely and openly with all interested parties - professionals, patients and community groups. Not for him the secret conclave of five people who dreamed up Margaret Thatcher's \"internal market\" without even consulting fellow ministers, let alone the health service. Third and most important, the Thatcher review concluded with the offer of a mere .00005% increase in health spending. Mr Blair's begins with a record four-year increase promising an extra 6% annually. </p> <p>William Hague scored some clever debating points in yesterday's confrontation in the Commons, but in doing so he came near to painting himself into the same dangerous corner that his predecessors did in the 1940s. Just as they opposed the creation of the NHS - which took years for the party to live down - so Mr Hague appeared to oppose the government's plan to modernise it. Yet modernisation is what the NHS needs. </p> <p>The prime minister is right to try to carry the service with him. Carrying the troops - managers as well as medics - is crucial if the reforms are to work. Much of the framework is already in place. The National Institute for Clinical Excellence is one year old but needs more teams to assess new drugs and medical procedures. It has had too slow a start. A new inspectorate - the Commission for Health Improvement - begins next month, ensuring doctors become more accountable under the new system for clinical governance. There are new national service frameworks to improve cancer, heart disease and mental health treatment. Where the government is making a mistake is in the excessive central controls which the health secretary set out after the prime minister had spoken. The idea that the performance of all 100 health authorities would be continually monitored, with quarterly penalties and rewards according to performance, is not just absurd but impossible. </p> <p>The prime minister's programme involved five Ps: closer partnerships, better performance, fewer professional demarcation boundaries, better patient care, and more emphasis on prevention. We would endorse all five, but add a sixth, following the report yesterday by the commissioner for public appointments: an urgent review of patronage. There is nothing wrong in principle in appointing councillors on to health authorities and hospital trusts - indeed they add a much needed democratic element - but it should not be in the hands of the health secretary, as the report amply demonstrates. Cronyism has run rife, with 284 Labour appointees, 36 Lib Dems and just 23 Tories. </p> <p>A seventh P - the proof of the Blair pudding - will not be known for years. Turning round Europe's biggest institution will take time. But voters ought to see the fairness in a prime minister who has delivered the cash asking the service to deliver the performance. This is a major gamble by Mr Blair, but it's one that he fully deserves to win. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.doh.gov.uk/\">Department of Health</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Thirteen years ago a previous prime minister intervened in a \"health crisis\" without knowing what to do. Like Tony Blair, Margaret Thatcher made her initial intervention in a January television interview. Like Tony Blair, she was horrified by the wide variations in performance in different parts of the country. Like Tony Blair, she set up a review. But that is where the similarities between the two reviews end. There are three obvious differences. The current health crisis does not compare with the \"bankruptcy\" facing the service in 1987. Next, unlike Margaret Thatcher, Tony Blair signalled yesterday he would be consulting widely and openly with all interested parties - professionals, patients and community groups. Not for him the secret conclave of five people who dreamed up Margaret Thatcher's \"internal market\" without even consulting fellow ministers, let alone the health service. Third and most important, the Thatcher review concluded with the offer of a mere .00005% increase in health spending. Mr Blair's begins with a record four-year increase promising an extra 6% annually. William Hague scored some clever debating points in yesterday's confrontation in the Commons, but in doing so he came near to painting himself into the same dangerous corner that his predecessors did in the 1940s. Just as they opposed the creation of the NHS - which took years for the party to live down - so Mr Hague appeared to oppose the government's plan to modernise it. Yet modernisation is what the NHS needs. The prime minister is right to try to carry the service with him. Carrying the troops - managers as well as medics - is crucial if the reforms are to work. Much of the framework is already in place. The National Institute for Clinical Excellence is one year old but needs more teams to assess new drugs and medical procedures. It has had too slow a start. A new inspectorate - the Commission for Health Improvement - begins next month, ensuring doctors become more accountable under the new system for clinical governance. There are new national service frameworks to improve cancer, heart disease and mental health treatment. Where the government is making a mistake is in the excessive central controls which the health secretary set out after the prime minister had spoken. The idea that the performance of all 100 health authorities would be continually monitored, with quarterly penalties and rewards according to performance, is not just absurd but impossible. The prime minister's programme involved five Ps: closer partnerships, better performance, fewer professional demarcation boundaries, better patient care, and more emphasis on prevention. We would endorse all five, but add a sixth, following the report yesterday by the commissioner for public appointments: an urgent review of patronage. There is nothing wrong in principle in appointing councillors on to health authorities and hospital trusts - indeed they add a much needed democratic element - but it should not be in the hands of the health secretary, as the report amply demonstrates. Cronyism has run rife, with 284 Labour appointees, 36 Lib Dems and just 23 Tories. A seventh P - the proof of the Blair pudding - will not be known for years. Turning round Europe's biggest institution will take time. But voters ought to see the fairness in a prime minister who has delivered the cash asking the service to deliver the performance. This is a major gamble by Mr Blair, but it's one that he fully deserves to win. Department of Health",

      "bodyText": "The government yesterday promised an overhaul of the way in which candidates are chosen to sit on the boards of health authorities and trusts after an independent inquiry found the NHS had become politicised by the recruitment of a flood of Labour supporters to top positions. In a damning report, published yesterday, Dame Rennie Fritchie, the commissioner for public appointments, called for the overhaul after concluding that political affiliation had been more important than merit in some appointments to health authorities and NHS trusts. The inquiry, which followed Conservative accusations of cronyism over the replacement of some highly experienced trust chairpeople with Labour councillors, also found that the appointments process itself had been politicised through the practice of automatically consulting MPs on candidate shortlists. The shadow health secretary, Liam Fox, yesterday called the findings \"a truly damning indictment\" of how Tony Blair's government had \"corrupted the management\" of the NHS. The report is a serious embarrassment for the health secretary, Alan Milburn, and for his predecessor, Frank Dobson, who is now Labour's candidate for London mayor. Dame Rennie pointed out that while the politicisation of the appointments had begun under the Conservatives, it had \"gained new momentum\" since Labour took power in May 1997. \"Much of this stems from the wish of the then secretary of state for health, Mr Dobson, to increase the presence on NHS boards of representatives from the community and the accompanying decision to seek nominations from MPs and local authorities,\" she concluded. Though Mr Dobson had stressed that appointments should be made on merit, representation seemed to have become the \"primary consideration\", the report found, with the drive to raise the numbers of women and ethnic minority candidates sometimes taking precedence over the needs of the board. Dame Rennie found that, of all the local councillors appointed to health authorities and NHS trusts between May 1 1997, and November 11 last year, 284 were from the Labour party, 36 were Liberal Democrats and 23 were Conservatives. Launching the document yesterday, she said: \"It is clear that there have been instances where a person's political association has been a decisive factor in their early selection and appointment and that decisions have not always been based on merit. \"The public need to know that people who are appointed to run NHS boards are there on merit and are fit for the purpose. Mr Milburn yesterday promised a shake-up of the appointments system to devolve decisions on local appointments out of the hands of ministers and into the power of local health organisations. However, he defended moves to increase the representation of women and ethnic minority candidates on health bodies. Yesterday's report, delayed by three months so that all the evidence could be published, includes more than 20 recommendations for improving the appointments process for chairs and non-executive directors of NHS bodies. It proposes an end to the practice of systematically consulting MPs over shortlisted candidates, and of seeking nominations directly from local authorities. Steps should be taken to speed up the process and to stop the introduction of last-minute entrants to the process - another trend attacked by the Tories who complained that Labour placemen were being parachuted in. Mr Dobson strongly defended his record on improving representation. He said: \"The proper procedures were followed in every case and no recommendation should have arrived on my desk unless the NHS officials and an independent assessor were satisfied that the person concerned was up to the job.\" The NHS confederation, which represents NHS trusts, health authorities and health boards, backed Dame Rennie's call that merit based on an agreed job description should be the \"overriding consideration\" in appointments to health boards.",

The gang used fake documents to fool customs officials into believing the cigarettes were being exported to destinations outside the European Union, avoiding excise duty in Britain, it was alleged. But the cigarettes were really sold on at full price within the EU, mainly in Spain, it was claimed. The smugglers allegedly were able to siphon off the excise duty of more than \u00a31m on each of the 119 lorry loads instead of paying it to the exchequer. But the gang was caught after customs officers mounted a surveillance operation, tipping off authorities in Spain who seized two lorries containing 11m cigarettes, Exeter crown court was told. The millions of pounds the gang made were laundered through a network of companies and reinvested in real estate and fleets of cars, it was claimed. Alun Jenkins, prosecuting, said the ringleader of the tax dodge was businessman Roger Weston, of Theydon Bois, Essex, who denies conspiring with others to evade duty between October 1995 and April 1997. The cigarettes came from a bonded warehouse in Epping which Weston owned, and which was run from a base at the London Industrial Freight Terminal, it was claimed. \"I am not suggesting that Weston has \u00a3178m tucked away in his back pocket, but his cut was substantial, he made an absolute fortune,\" Mr Jones said.

Weston had known assets of \u00a36m - including 34 holiday flats in Spain, a \u00a31m home in Essex, fleets of cars, and a boat. Brian Spellacey, 62, recruited as a UK agent for one of Weston's companies, made out an order under a false name for 11m Sunset cigarettes, Mr Jenkins said. The authorities became aware of the scam in April 1997 and launched a surveillance operation, and in October 1998 the Spanish authorities made 11 arrests. The Spanish end of the conspiracy was run by Juan Chaves, Mr Jenkins said. \"We don't know how many people were involved, but there were a lot,\" he added.

Only India and Pakistan could work out their difficulties, he said. \"I can think of no enduring solution to this problem that can be achieved in any other way.\" He would say the same thing to General Pervez Musharraf, Pakistan's military ruler, at their meeting on Saturday, he said. His remarks came two days after unidentified gunmen killed at least 35 unarmed Sikhs in a Kashmiri village. Soon after that, gunmen stormed the army quarters in Srinagar. Indian paramilitary troops found themselves bombarding their own building for 24 hours with mortars and machine guns before planting explosives on the roof to dislodge the men.

      "body": "<p>The annual analysis of the Budget seems stuck in a time-warp. Two-thirds of people in Britain don't smoke, most don't drink beer or spirits other than occasionally, so why the emphasis on the duties attaching to these products? Growing pensioner numbers and the fact that young people are reverting to renting rather than buying housing means that mortgage changes are becoming increasingly irrelevant to many. And with house prices averaging around \u00a3100,000 in the UK, why feature a woman who is buying a house worth \u00a3275,000? The vast majority of people live in towns and cities where owning a car is plain daft; many sensible people rent at weekends when they need a car and save hundreds of pounds each year, yet 2p on petrol or a rise in car tax is seen as life-threatening.</p> <p>The Budget is a macro-economic tool. By focusing on individuals, none of whom can be average in a country as diverse as this, the whole picture is distorted. <br><b>Stuart Skyte</b> <br>Oxford</p> <p>\u0095 The decision to raise taxes on cigarettes by 25p is disappointing given the mounting evidence of a link between smoking and poverty. Those earning a good salary will pay the additional cost, while people on low incomes will struggle to find the extra money and, given the added stress, could end up smoking more. <br><b>Sam Semoff </b> <br>Liverpool</p> <p>\u0095 Does Gordon Brown know anybody trying to raise a family on \u00a330,000 a year in the London area? A typical young family relying on a single income has already been priced out of the housing market and must be wondering if the government is looking to drive them to bring up their children in the cramped conditions of a small flat comparable only to the space allowances of 19th-century slums. The removal of the married person's allowance on top of the scrapping of Miras means this group is the only one that has been made worse off by the Budget. <br><b>Adam Firth </b> <br>Shoeburyness, Essex</p> <p>\u0095 The announcement that there is to be no real change in the tax treatment of cars may win a few votes, but this government is ambivalent on the pollution and misery caused by traffic congestion. How councils can be expected to implement the changes envisaged by recent papers on reducing child road deaths with this background message of unabashed automania is anyone's guess. <br><b>Cllr Laurence Mann</b> <br>Richmond upon Thames <br><a href=\"mailto:lnmann@cix.compulink.co.uk\">lnmann@cix.compulink.co.uk</a></p> <p>\u0095 This was a disappointing budget for most pensioners. Inflation is running at 2.3%, yet pensioners get an increase of 1.1%. An extra \u00a350 per household winter fuel allowance, worth 96p a week for a single pensioner, is no compensation for the miserly 75p rise in the state pension. <br><b>Cliff Fuller</b> <br>Gloucester</p> <p>\u0095 As a pensioner in my seventies, living on a state pension and small occupational pension, both based on 1975 levels, and occupying a band B house, I calculate that the Chanceller's largesse will just about cover the increase in my council tax bill. <br><b>JM Carter</b> <br>Huddersfield <br><a href=\"mailto:jmmc@cwcom.net\">jmmc@cwcom.net</a></p> <p>\u0095 My inflation-linked pension is going up by 1.1% in April. My inflation linked petrol is going up by 2.5%. Funny stuff this inflation. <br><b>John Loader </b> <br>Ely, Cambs <br><a href=\"mailto:john4jul@waitrose.com\">john4jul@waitrose.com</a></p> <p>\u0095 Gordon Brown said he is putting up the price of petrol and beer \"in line with inflation\". Beer, which in most places costs about \u00a31.50 to \u00a32 a pint, is going up 1p. Petrol, which ranges from about 75p to 85p a litre, is go ing up by 2p. Did Mr Brown do any maths at school? <br><b>Krystyna Wiczkowska</b> <br>Manchester <br><a href=\"mailto:krysia@ukgateway.net\">krysia@ukgateway.net</a></p> <p>\u0095 The day after the Budget and even the television guide (G2, March 22) seems politically charged. On BBC1 the schedule was: 9.30pm Budget Response; 9.35 True Lies. <br><b>Dr Matt Jones</b> <br>London <br><a href=\"mailto:always@acm.org\">always@acm.org</a></p> <p>\u0095 Despite the unprecedented increases in health spending, I wager some letters will still be from whinging cynics. Are these people incapable of giving credit where it's due? <br><b>James Rogers</b> <br>St Albans, Herts</p> <p>\u0095 Mr Hague accuses Labour of increasing taxes by stealth. The Tories invented stealth taxes, with Norman Lamont a leading proponent of staged tax rises.

      "bodyText": "The annual analysis of the Budget seems stuck in a time-warp. Two-thirds of people in Britain don't smoke, most don't drink beer or spirits other than occasionally, so why the emphasis on the duties attaching to these products? Growing pensioner numbers and the fact that young people are reverting to renting rather than buying housing means that mortgage changes are becoming increasingly irrelevant to many. And with house prices averaging around \u00a3100,000 in the UK, why feature a woman who is buying a house worth \u00a3275,000? The vast majority of people live in towns and cities where owning a car is plain daft; many sensible people rent at weekends when they need a car and save hundreds of pounds each year, yet 2p on petrol or a rise in car tax is seen as life-threatening. The Budget is a macro-economic tool. By focusing on individuals, none of whom can be average in a country as diverse as this, the whole picture is distorted. Stuart Skyte Oxford \u0095 The decision to raise taxes on cigarettes by 25p is disappointing given the mounting evidence of a link between smoking and poverty. Those earning a good salary will pay the additional cost, while people on low incomes will struggle to find the extra money and, given the added stress, could end up smoking more. Sam Semoff Liverpool \u0095 Does Gordon Brown know anybody trying to raise a family on \u00a330,000 a year in the London area? A typical young family relying on a single income has already been priced out of the housing market and must be wondering if the government is looking to drive them to bring up their children in the cramped conditions of a small flat comparable only to the space allowances of 19th-century slums. The removal of the married person's allowance on top of the scrapping of Miras means this group is the only one that has been made worse off by the Budget. Adam Firth Shoeburyness, Essex \u0095 The announcement that there is to be no real change in the tax treatment of cars may win a few votes, but this government is ambivalent on the pollution and misery caused by traffic congestion. How councils can be expected to implement the changes envisaged by recent papers on reducing child road deaths with this background message of unabashed automania is anyone's guess. Cllr Laurence Mann Richmond upon Thames lnmann@cix.compulink.co.uk \u0095 This was a disappointing budget for most pensioners. Inflation is running at 2.3%, yet pensioners get an increase of 1.1%. An extra \u00a350 per household winter fuel allowance, worth 96p a week for a single pensioner, is no compensation for the miserly 75p rise in the state pension. Cliff Fuller Gloucester \u0095 As a pensioner in my seventies, living on a state pension and small occupational pension, both based on 1975 levels, and occupying a band B house, I calculate that the Chanceller's largesse will just about cover the increase in my council tax bill. JM Carter Huddersfield jmmc@cwcom.net \u0095 My inflation-linked pension is going up by 1.1% in April. My inflation linked petrol is going up by 2.5%. Funny stuff this inflation. John Loader Ely, Cambs john4jul@waitrose.com \u0095 Gordon Brown said he is putting up the price of petrol and beer \"in line with inflation\". Beer, which in most places costs about \u00a31.50 to \u00a32 a pint, is going up 1p. Petrol, which ranges from about 75p to 85p a litre, is go ing up by 2p. Did Mr Brown do any maths at school? Krystyna Wiczkowska Manchester krysia@ukgateway.net \u0095 The day after the Budget and even the television guide (G2, March 22) seems politically charged. On BBC1 the schedule was: 9.30pm Budget Response; 9.35 True Lies. Dr Matt Jones London always@acm.org \u0095 Despite the unprecedented increases in health spending, I wager some letters will still be from whinging cynics. Are these people incapable of giving credit where it's due? James Rogers St Albans, Herts \u0095 Mr Hague accuses Labour of increasing taxes by stealth. The Tories invented stealth taxes, with Norman Lamont a leading proponent of staged tax rises. More subtly, Tory underfunding, where they postponed essential health and infrastructure spending to buy short-term popularity by keeping taxes down, was, in itself, a stealth tax. For hundreds of thousands of patients, who face long periods on waiting lists or cancelled operations, this stealth tax has become a pain tax, or a stress tax paid by their families. Some have been forced to mortgage their homes to buy private treatment because operations like cardiac bypass surgery often involve waiting periods of a year or more. Ken Daly Pro Euro Conservative party \u0095 Middle England has consitently said it would be willing to pay more tax so the NHS and schools can receive extra funding.

After weeks of daily cooperation with the Foreign Office, we were ambushed by Mr Hain acting - we must-suppose - on behalf of his new American friends. In a little over 24 hours over a weekend, he demanded we cut the number of journalists, aid workers, doctors, religious leaders etc on board from 207 to 104, then to \"30 to 40\" then \"20 or so\".

All of this is in writing and available for inspection and was widely reported. </p> <p>In the face of these new demands, we called a press conference, announced our refusal of these terms, the postponement of the flight and the commencement of a legal case against the government for putting all of this - unlawfully we contend - to the sanctions committee in the first place. Hain's letter now claims there was no significance in these new demands and that he obtained UN clearance as soon as we postponed the flight. Peculiar, you might think, as we refused to answer the long list of new demands we were given three hours to deal with. In any case we have seen no such UN clearance and neither has anyone else.

And no one knows this better than its women.

Serbian men, some of the best Balkan patriarchs, are back home, hangdog faces in an alcoholic blur, too disoriented and depressed to stand in line.</p> <p>\"Women may be the first to be fired, the first to make sacrifices for their children, but they are keeping this country alive,\" says Brankica Grupkovic, a 41-year-old human rights lawyer. \"Like every woman, I used to worry about ageing. Now there are so many more painful problems because every day is an exercise in survival at the most basic level.\"</p> <p>Time is not treating Serbia well. Half its population live below the poverty level, with daily soup kitchen meals jumping from 18,000 to over 100,000 in recent months. Infant mortality is on the increase, as are the invisible poor, prostitution, domestic violence, professors selling smuggled petrol on sombre streets. Such is the spiral of decomposition that, according to the UN, 25% of Serbian women feel it would be \"irresponsible\" to bear children in their nation in its present state. Unlike Kosovo, where the UN mission has ensured that vulnerable persons' lists and 24-hour hotlines now abound, Serbia proper has more or less had to go it alone since international economic sanctions were first imposed eight years ago.</p> <p>With average monthly wages now hovering around \u00a320 (a haircut costs \u00a34), growing numbers of women have taken to sweeping the streets, cleaning offices or bartering on Serbia's burgeoning black market. You see them by the busload, in the middle of the night, travelling the long, rough road to Bulgaria, Romania and Hungary to buy the goods - cheaper cloth, paper towels, underwear. And you see them dreaming of change.</p> <p>\"There will be no revolution here because the sanctions have destroyed the middle class,\" says Grupkovic, a divorcee who has learnt to survive by refurbishing apartments, a strategy that has seen her move four times since 1995. \"My salary was $2,000 in 1990. I used to go to Rome twice a year to buy my wardrobe. Now it's less than $300 and I haven't bought any clothes in years which, of course, impacts on your self-confidence.\"</p> <p>Five hundred thousand of Serbia's brightest and best have fled; those who have stayed have an over-riding sense that things will get worse before they get better. Repression is growing and Milosevic, now despised by the overwhelming majority, shows no sign of going away. But there has been a change, a dramatic shift in gender roles not even he can erase: Serbian women have been empowered by the very hardship that has moved them into the public domain.</p> <p>It is a power shift that has pitted them against Serbia's patriarchal system and turned them into Milosevic's silent foe. For the first time ever, many want to challenge the system, to break out of the old moulds, just as the ANC women's league did years ago during the dark days of apartheid.</p> <p>\"Why should we be exluded, like second-class citizens, and not have a voice in matters of life and death when we are so obviously keeping this country together?\" Grupkovic asks. \"For far too long, we have been separated from power by an invisible wall, but we are no longer willing to be invisible, we make up 54% of this population and we have to be heard.\"</p> <p>Voting is not compulsory in Yugoslavia and most women have rarely used the right. Feminists say they could now play a catalytic role in ushering in democratic changes - if given the chance. Although Yugoslavia has come a long way since 1978 when the Coatian writer Slavenka Draculic set up its first feminist group (causing some men to want to chain her in Zagreb's main square), prejudice is still deep-seated.</p> <p>\"There is this very strong sense here that if you're a feminist, you're either lesbian or divorced,\" sighs Ivana Alexic, a campaigner for women's rights. \"Serbian women have been taught to be passive and told not to vote. They have no idea about their own human and political rights, and that has been reflected in the decline of female representatives at all political levels.\"</p> <p>The response has already been enthusiastic. Since Yugoslavia's descent into civil war, it has been women who have been behind the vast majority of pacifist and civic initiatives, often crossing ethnic lines in the process. \"There has been a tremendous solidarity among women that has not been related to ethnic or national identity,\" Jasmina Tesanovic points out. \"They have covered each other with false names and nationalities, risked lives, written letters, given promises and kept them. Today, 70% of all our new non-governmental groups are created by women.\"</p> <p>Last month, 80 such organisations gathered to discuss ways of mobilising women across the beleaguered state. \"We've got a two-prong strategy to raise gender awareness by educating women in the media, trade unions and other liberal professions, and lobby for more involvement on a political level,\" Alexic says.</p> <p>Time is of the essence. There are fears of another crackdown on dissidents before crucial local elections are held in April. \"For a long time, we knew what we didn't want but not what we wanted,\" Grupkovic says. \"Now we know we want democracy, we also know the only way of getting it is by galvanising women into action.\"</p> <p>With the resumption of air links to Belgrade, it is hoped help will also come from feminists abroad who have yet to experience Belgrade's bad kind of queues.</p>",

Although Yugoslavia has come a long way since 1978 when the Coatian writer Slavenka Draculic set up its first feminist group (causing some men to want to chain her in Zagreb's main square), prejudice is still deep-seated. \"There is this very strong sense here that if you're a feminist, you're either lesbian or divorced,\" sighs Ivana Alexic, a campaigner for women's rights. \"Serbian women have been taught to be passive and told not to vote. They have no idea about their own human and political rights, and that has been reflected in the decline of female representatives at all political levels.\" The response has already been enthusiastic. Since Yugoslavia's descent into civil war, it has been women who have been behind the vast majority of pacifist and civic initiatives, often crossing ethnic lines in the process. \"There has been a tremendous solidarity among women that has not been related to ethnic or national identity,\" Jasmina Tesanovic points out. \"They have covered each other with false names and nationalities, risked lives, written letters, given promises and kept them. Today, 70% of all our new non-governmental groups are created by women.\" Last month, 80 such organisations gathered to discuss ways of mobilising women across the beleaguered state. \"We've got a two-prong strategy to raise gender awareness by educating women in the media, trade unions and other liberal professions, and lobby for more involvement on a political level,\" Alexic says. Time is of the essence. There are fears of another crackdown on dissidents before crucial local elections are held in April. \"For a long time, we knew what we didn't want but not what we wanted,\" Grupkovic says. \"Now we know we want democracy, we also know the only way of getting it is by galvanising women into action.\" With the resumption of air links to Belgrade, it is hoped help will also come from feminists abroad who have yet to experience Belgrade's bad kind of queues.",

He callously took that away. It is obvious to all who have been present at this trial that he is not just a murderous liar but evil personified. According to the evidence, if it is to be believed, this is a person who within 12 hours of murdering my daughter was playing pool with his mate, and who within 18 hours was out on the town again. He has brought eternal shame on his family and tainted them and his friends with his web of deceit and lies.\"</p> <p>Ms King disappeared in the early hours of October 31 1998 after leaving Chaser's night club in Kingswood, Bristol, to walk to her home in Warmley a few miles away.</p> <p>Her brother, Andrew, who had met her in the club that evening, gave her \u00a35 for a taxi, but she did not take one.</p> <p>Her disappearance prompted a huge police search, and her semi-naked body was discovered three days later in a copse a few hundred yards from her home.</p> <p>She had been beaten about the face and strangled with one of the legs of her trousers.</p> <p>The killer had stamped on her abdomen, and had stuffed her underwear and part of her trousers into her mouth to stop her screaming.</p> <p>Forensic experts recovered tiny green fibres from her clothing that were later found to match a Ralph Lauren shirt recovered from Hunt's home. The pattern on the soles of a pair of shoes belonging to Hunt were found to match prints left on Ms King's body.</p> <p>The big breakthrough for police came with the discovery of a set of house keys during the search of the thick undergrowth where the body was found. Hunt was persuaded by his fiancee to ring Crimestoppers to report the loss of a similar set on the night of the killing.</p> <p>Hunt, now 22, was arrested when the keys were found to fit the front and back doors of the house in Warmley where he lived with his mother Teena.</p> <p>Prosecutors told the court that on the night of the killing Hunt had woken his mother at around 3.30 in the morning by banging on the back door of the house because he was locked out.</p> <p>Hunt, an only child whose father left home when he was five, had spent the evening drinking in a city centre nightclub with two friends but, after downing eight pints of lager, left the club alone at around 1.30 in the morning to make his way back to the Warmley area.

      "bodyText": "A factory worker with a previous caution for indecent exposure made 80 threatening phone calls to women on the night he murdered a secretary, police disclosed yesterday. Paul Hunt, who had attended the same primary school as his victim, was last night beginning a life sentence after a jury at Bristol crown court found him guilty of killing Jenny King, 22, as she returned home from a Friday night out in October 1998. Friends and relatives of the dead woman sobbed and applauded as the jury returned its unanimous verdict after four and a half hours deliberation at the end of the 12 day trial. Ms King's father, Ray, said he could find no quotable words to express his \"total contempt\" for the killer. \"Jenny has no future. He callously took that away. It is obvious to all who have been present at this trial that he is not just a murderous liar but evil personified. According to the evidence, if it is to be believed, this is a person who within 12 hours of murdering my daughter was playing pool with his mate, and who within 18 hours was out on the town again. He has brought eternal shame on his family and tainted them and his friends with his web of deceit and lies.\" Ms King disappeared in the early hours of October 31 1998 after leaving Chaser's night club in Kingswood, Bristol, to walk to her home in Warmley a few miles away. Her brother, Andrew, who had met her in the club that evening, gave her \u00a35 for a taxi, but she did not take one. Her disappearance prompted a huge police search, and her semi-naked body was discovered three days later in a copse a few hundred yards from her home. She had been beaten about the face and strangled with one of the legs of her trousers. The killer had stamped on her abdomen, and had stuffed her underwear and part of her trousers into her mouth to stop her screaming. Forensic experts recovered tiny green fibres from her clothing that were later found to match a Ralph Lauren shirt recovered from Hunt's home. The pattern on the soles of a pair of shoes belonging to Hunt were found to match prints left on Ms King's body. The big breakthrough for police came with the discovery of a set of house keys during the search of the thick undergrowth where the body was found. Hunt was persuaded by his fiancee to ring Crimestoppers to report the loss of a similar set on the night of the killing. Hunt, now 22, was arrested when the keys were found to fit the front and back doors of the house in Warmley where he lived with his mother Teena. Prosecutors told the court that on the night of the killing Hunt had woken his mother at around 3.30 in the morning by banging on the back door of the house because he was locked out. Hunt, an only child whose father left home when he was five, had spent the evening drinking in a city centre nightclub with two friends but, after downing eight pints of lager, left the club alone at around 1.30 in the morning to make his way back to the Warmley area. His girlfriend had decided not to join him on his regular Friday night out because she was feeling unwell. In evidence he told the jury he could not recall ever meeting Ms King and said that if he had killed her he would not be standing there \"putting her family, friends and relatives through what they are going through\". That was, said the judge, Mrs Justice Hallett, \"a wicked and bare faced lie\". The evidence against him was overwhelming and as it mounted up he had continued to protest his innocence. She told him: \"Jenny King was a lovely young woman with everything to live for. She died at your hands, tragically young, because she rejected your sexual advances. \"I also suspect the reason you got close enough to make sexual advances to her was because she recognised you as someone from her childhood, someone she trusted.\" It emerged in court that Hunt had in the past received cautions for indecent exposure and making obscene phone calls, and in the six months leading up to the killing had made around 4,000 threatening phone calls to women in the Bristol area from his home in Warmley. The women were apparently chosen at random. Detective Superintendent Bill Davies, who led the police investigation, said there was no evidence that Hunt had made any such calls to his victim. \"Jenny was a lovely young lady. She was well liked in the community, a vivacious young girl. She was brutally murdered by Hunt because she was in the wrong place at the wrong time.\" He said that in the period leading up to his arrest Hunt - \"a callous, ruthless, brutal killer\" - had made thousands of phone calls to women in the Bristol area, threatening rape. Eighty of those calls were made just before he set out on the night he killed Ms King.",

      "bodyText": "Ancestors walked like gorillas Humans evolved from tree-dwelling ancestors who walked in the same way as modern gorillas and chimpanzees, new research shows. Researchers at George Washington University, in Washington DC, report in the journal Nature, today, that they have found a bone in the wrist of Australopithecus, the ancestor of modern humans, that shows it was descended from creatures which walked with their bodies slumped forward and their knuckles to the ground. Knuckle-walking allowed large apes to use their hands to walk with but keep long fingers to help them with tree climbing. The discovery is another piece in the jigsaw of the emergence of human-like creatures from the forests of Africa, according to Leslie Aiello of University College, London, who also writes in Nature. \"It tells us that sometime way back in the dawn of time, the common ancestor of humans and apes walked on its knuckles. \"It puts paid to some alternative ideas - that they were climbers or bipedal from the beginning, or that they dog-paddled in the sea.\" Tim Radford Body of pensioner exhumed The body of a pensioner was exhumed amid tight security yesterday in a police investigation of the deaths of six residents of a care home. The remains of George Fowler, 86, were removed from Surville cemetery near St Helier, Jersey, in the Channel Islands. Graveside prayers were led by the Rev David Shaw before the three-hour exhumation began just after 4am under floodlights but concealed by a screen and tent. The road to the cemetery was sealed off, and officers with dogs patrolled the area. Mr Fowler, who had lived and worked in Jersey for many years, had been a resident at Carnarvon Lodge care home for the elderly in Clacton, Essex, for six weeks before his death last July. Essex police were given permission by the Jersey authorities to exhume his body in a joint investigation with Essex social services of the alleged mistreatment of residents at the home, which has been closed since last October. Acting Detective Superintendent Dick Madden of Essex police said it was a \"sensitive occasion\" for those involved, and that the exhumation had been a \"dignified ceremony\". Mr Fowler's body had been taken to a mortuary at Jersey general hospital for a postmortem, the results of which would not be known for six or seven weeks, he said. Police have said the aim of the postmortem was to seek support for information they had about his death. Mr Fowler's family did not attend the exhumation but were expected to attend the re-internment at the cemetery, scheduled for 11am today. The Essex police investigation into Carnarvon Lodge started in February last year and is now concerned with six deaths including that of Mr Fowler. The bodies of four of the people concerned had been cremated. Four people have been remanded in custody on a variety of charges connected with the deaths of pensioners at Carnarvon Lodge. A man, 46, who has not been named, is on bail pending further police inquiries. Yoko Ono sends love to bed-in Four couples who embarked on a bed-in to win \u00a310,000 and a holiday to Canada, have been sent a basket of flowers by Yoko Ono. The bed-in, begun 14 days ago in Liverpool, was organised by Radio City 96.7FM to recreate John Lennon's call for world peace and mark what would have been his 60th birthday. To win, the couples are required to stay in bed all day - with the exception of 10-minute breaks every two hours So far, no one has dropped out. Ono's gift of roses and freesias came with a card reading: \"Imagine all the people living in peace. Lots of love, Yoko.\" Participant Samantha Woods said: \"We could not believe it when the flowers arrived. It was really kind to think of us and send her encouragement.\" Helen Carter Ex-soldier awarded \u00a3745,000 A former private in the Royal Pioneer Corps who was attacked by a corporal was yesterday awarded \u00a3745,000 in damages by the army. Leslie Hughes was thrown through a first floor window, severely injuring his arm, and later suffered a mental collapse after the incident at the West Moors barracks in Dorset. Mr Justice Sachs, agreeing the settlement at the high court in London, said: \"It is a sad and lamentable story which blighted this claimant's life at the age of 18.\" Timothy Ryder, for Mr Hughes, told the judge that his client was assaulted in 1989 after going to collect his orders for the day. Mr Hughes was grabbed around the waist and pushed out of a window, severely cutting his right arm. He said Mr Hughes had still not fully recovered from the assault which had also triggered chronic paranoid schizophrenia. \"He will remain unemployable and in need of out-patient and at times, in-patient, care.\" Mr Hughes, who now lives with his father in Blackpool, Lancashire, said after the short hearing: \"It has taken a very long time to reach a settlement but I am very happy with the result today.\" A Ministry of Defence spokesman said the compensation was \"acceptable\".",

      "bodyText": "A prison chaplain who claimed she felt \"emotionally raped\" after an argument with a Roman Catholic priest has won a claim for sex discrimination at an industrial tribunal. Margaret Chilton, a Roman Catholic chaplain, discovered that male colleagues at Walton prison, in Liverpool, were paid \u00a310 an hour while she was paid only \u00a325 for a 20-hour week. Miss Chilton was also refused permission to use cell keys while male colleagues were given access to keys to the cells of the 1,500 prisoners. When she complained, she was dismissed. The tribunal at Liverpool ruled the prison service discriminated against Miss Chilton, 57, a theology graduate, because she was a woman. She had complained to the prison chaplain, Father Gerard Burns, and the prison governor that she was being treated differently because of her sex. Fr Burns refused to issue her with cell keys and began shouting at her. \"Father Burns had reduced me to tears by way of his shouting at me, she said. \"When I tried to speak I was told that he could ask me to do as many hours as he saw fit. It was a complete violation of my rights which could be described as emotional rape.\" The tribunal panel ruled that Miss Chilton had suffered discrimination. It added: \"Even on the basis of Fr Burns's own evidence we would be bound to find that there had been unlawful discrimination against Miss Chilton.\" Compensation will be decided at a later date. A second claim that Miss Chilton had been victimised by the prison was dismissed. Miss Chilton said later: \"I feel that I have been put through a long ordeal, both at the prison and in the tribunal, because I am a woman. It was more like I was on trial rather than the prison service. They attempted to brand me as a manipulative, scheming woman, which is the ultimate in sex discrimination.\"",

The articles - headlined House Mistress and Secrets of Madam Speaker - referred to Miss Boothroyd's \"interesting role as the understudy chatelaine of Newton Hall\", Lord Walston's stately home near Cambridge, where she was alleged to have acted as a \"stand-in weekend hostess\" at drunken parties. It was also claimed she acted as a surrogate mother to Lord Walston's six children while his wife, Catherine, conducted her 13-year affair with Graham Greene which was to become the subject of his novel The End of the Affair, now a film starring Ralph Fiennes. In a statement from Miss Boothroyd's office, the speaker insisted that implications that she was the mistress of Lord Walston were entirely untrue. \"The two publications and Mr Cash have accepted that any such suggestions would be wrong. In addition, the two publications and Mr Cash are paying Miss Boothroyd a substantial sum in damages and all her legal costs. Miss Boothroyd has decided to pay the damages to charity.\" Both publications have since printed apologies for the articles by Cash, son of the Eurosceptic Tory MP Bill Cash, published last month. A spokesman for Miss Boothroyd said: \"The speaker was very upset when she saw what the two articles had said about her. She worked as Lord Walston's secretary for several years before entering parliament and, as Lady Walston became increasingly ill with the cancer that eventually killed her, her duties in London and Cambridgeshire became more onerous. \"At no stage, however, was her relationship with Lord Walston other than entirely proper and she remains a firm family friend of the late Lord and Lady Walston's children. She would have had no hesitation in pursuing her claim in the high court for damages and an injunction and, if necessary, taking the case to trial.\" He added: \"The speaker can now put this unpleasant episode behind her, secure in the knowledge that the defendants have publicly accepted the need to repair the damage done to her reputation.\" Both the Express and the Spectator confirmed they had paid \u00a35,000 each in damages to various charities chosen by Miss Boothroyd. Harry Walston was made a Labour life peer in 1961 and became a junior minister under Harold Wilson. Since his death aged 78 in 1991, Miss Boothroyd has continued to live rent free in a cottage close to the Walston family home.",

      "bodyText": "A third man suspected of involvement in the murder of Stephen Lawrence was arrested yesterday as detectives from Scotland Yard's elite racial and violent crimes taskforce continued to question two others about the brutal stabbing seven years ago. Although police refused to give details about the three men and the operation was shrouded in secrecy, there was optimism within the Metropolitan police that the team had achieved a breakthrough. The three men are not among the five previously identified as prime suspects - Jamie and Neil Acourt, Gary Dobson, Luke Knight and David Norris. Significantly, the trio all have fair hair. Detectives believe that a mystery sixth member of a gang that attacked and killed Stephen as he waited for a bus in Eltham, south London, was blond. Yesterday's arrest came 12 hours after another appeal for help on BBC's Crimewatch by Deputy Assistant Commissioner John Grieve, director of the taskforce, and Stephen's parents Doreen and Neville. Scotland Yard said yesterday that detectives had received more than 70 calls after the programme, and that six had provided \"good information\". On Tuesday two men were arrested in connection with the murder. The first, a 24-year-old, was seized in Glasgow in a joint operation with the Scottish crime squad, and the second was arrested as the Crimewatch programme was being broadcast at 9.35pm. The three men were questioned at an unnamed station in south London. Although police say they have challenged every assumption made by previous inquiries into Stephen's death, it is likely that the men are associates of Neil Acourt, Dobson and Knight, who were cleared of Stephen's murder in 1996 when a private prosecution failed. Several names of potential suspects were published by mistake in the index of the Macpherson report into the murder last February. After the failures of the original murder investigation, Scotland Yard was loth to reveal details that might jeopardise the current operation, which has involved 90 officers working from a secret location in south London. \"We are at a very, very delicate stage of the investigation,\" a source said. After questioning, the three men were released last night on police bail. Mr Grieve said his officers were hoping to trace a man who boasted to his girlfriend that he had \"direct knowledge of who was responsible for the murder\". The couple spoke about the stabbing at the Globe Bar in Larnaca, Cyprus, in September last year. He also revealed that advanced DNA tests were being carried out on a yellow lined jacket and a 2ft knife found in Eltham soon after the murder. The taskforce believes the ties that bound the suspects together have loosened, and that ex-partners of those involved might come forward. \"We can solve this. There is no place these racists can hide from justice. Clear your conscience and tell us what you know, any conspiracy can be broken,\" said Mr Grieve. The third arrest yesterday morning coincided with an unrelated anti-racist operation by the taskforce which led to more than 70 arrests, and news that three of the original Lawrence suspects had been arrested on Tuesday in connection with an alleged racket to smuggle illegal immigrants into the country in vans through the Channel tunnel. The Acourt brothers and Dobson were released on police bail pending an investigation by special branch officers in Kent. A friend of the Acourts, John Anthony Caetano, 26, of Dickson Road, Eltham, was charged with assisting the illegal entry of im migrants and is due to appear at Folkestone magistrates court tomorrow. \"None of these arrests is connected in any way with the new leads in the Stephen Lawrence murder inquiry,\" a spokesman for Kent police said.

Similar genetic traits have been found in the Basque country and northern Scottish communities like Orkney, suggesting a western fringe of direct descendants of hunter-gatherers who, in other parts of Europe, fused with new stone age settlers bringing the new technology of agriculture from the eastern Mediterranean. Scientists from Trinity College in Dublin and Leicester University studied distinguishing markers in the Y-chromosomes - found only in males - of 221 Irishmen. The results, published in the scientific journal Nature, show that western Irish men with Gaelic surnames come from families which have effectively been in the same place for up to 15,000, years. The distinctive pattern of genetic markers, known as haplogroup 1, was found in 98.3% of Gaelic-named men in Connaught, the westernmost province of Ireland, and 94.6% in Munster. Fewer than two thirds of Irish men with English names, and a little more than half with Scottish, had the same genetic pattern. Work by other genetic historians across Europe shows a steady falling away of the predominance of haplogroup 1 the further south and east they look, with few men in Greece and Turkey having the markers. But in the Basque country, 89% of men have them. The difference, researchers say, is best explained by the migration across Europe, over thousands of years, of neolithic farmers from the near east.",

According to a report leaked in Washington yesterday, Nasa space engineers knew that the brake thrusters on the polar lander were faulty before it crashed on December 3. The spacecraft arrived at Mars at a speed of 8km a second, and without thrusters to slow it to metres a second, it stood no chance. Although senior managers knew about the design flaws, Nasa concealed the facts and pretended to be mystified by the loss of the probe, according to a leading space commentator, James Oberg of UPI news agency. </p> <p><strong> Irregularities</strong></p> <p> Nasa's Mars exploration programme - there are plans to launch missions until 2005 - is already in crisis. An unpublished inquiry into the presumed crash of the polar lander is said to be \"devastating\". The agency is facing criticism for a series of spectacular space failures, including one on Mars just three months earlier. The report by Thomas Young, a retired aerospace executive, was currently \"locked in a box at Nasa while they work out how to spin it\", a senate source said yesterday. </p> <p>The new allegations about the polar lander crash were due to be debated in public for the first time in Washington yesterday when Nasa's chief, Daniel Goldin, faced a grilling from a senate committee. Committee sources predicted a \"torrid and lively session\". But Nasa officials dismissed the charges as \"wacko in every particular\" and said allegations of a cover-up were untrue. \"The story's major assertions are all wrong,\" Nasa spokesman Brian Welch said in Washington. </p> <p>UPI claimed that the braking thrusters had failed tests at the ultra-low temperatures the lander would have met as it tried to slow for its landing near the Martian south pole. Citing sources close to the independent investigation into the disappearance, UPI said the thruster ignition process was then successfully retried at higher temperatures. The irregularities in the testing process were uncovered by Nasa managers a few days before the loss of the lander - but were concealed from the public. That left the spacecraft heading for a landing in temperatures at which its thrusters had failed to work on at least one occasion. </p> <p>\"The engineers came to the conclusion that MPL wasn't going to work, but they didn't want to tell anyone about it. They said, 'We're already in flight, we've checked it out, there's nothing we can do on the ground - let's think some good thoughts and hope for a miracle,' \" Oberg said yesterday. </p> <p><strong> Confusion</strong></p> <p> Nasa's troubles multiplied in 1999 when a $250m infra-red telescope failed shortly after its launch. In September, the $125m Mars climate orbiter reached the red planet after an 11-month journey and went suddenly silent. After a hurried inquiry, shocked space chiefs admitted that one team working on the spacecraft mission systems had calculating in feet and pounds; another had been thinking in centimetres and kilograms. The software could not cope with the confusion. </p> <p>Then the orbiter's partner spacecraft, the $165m polar lander, vanished during what should have been its descent. With it went two separate probes, designed to crash into the Martian subsoil and detect water vapour. </p> <p>Mars was always a hard target. The Americans and the Soviet Union have launched 31 missions to Mars since the birth of the space race in 1957. In all, 18 had to be counted as failures. Some failed at launch. Others made it to Mars but then fell silent. Only 13 sent back useful data from the red planet, which is arid, bitterly cold, swept by savage dust-storms and scorched by ultraviolet radiation. </p> <p>Critics of Nasa will also point to much deeper problems nearer home. Nasa spent $1bn making the Mars observer spacecraft and lost it just as it arrived at the red planet in 1992. A new administrator, Mr Goldin, arrived and a new philosophy was announced. Things would be done faster, better and cheaper. Spacecraft would cost hundreds of millions rather than billions, and be designed, commissioned and launched in years rather than decades - with fewer failsafe systems in case things went wrong. </p> <p> There were some spectacular successes. But the Goldin years were also the years of squeezed budgets. Until 1990, Nasa was an explicit symbol of US supremacy - the agency that beat the Russians to the moon - and an implicit partner in the cold war. The high ground was space, and the US wanted to keep the high ground. After the end of the cold war, successive administrations began squeezing Nasa's budget and civil enterprise began to exploit the high frontier. </p> <p><strong> Experiment</strong></p> <p> Commercial spending on space overtook government spending five years ago. Other nations began to compete. The Europeans will launch their Mars Express mission in 2003, using a Russian rocket and carrying a British lander. The Japanese already have their own probe on the way to Mars. Nasa began looking for ways to cut costs, and according to critics, began cutting corners as well. A report into the loss of the Mars climate orbiter in September - with a British experiment on board - blamed \"silly mistakes and sloppy management\". Insiders talked of projects left to new recruits while experienced teams were broken up. </p> <p>\"It looks as if these missions haven't had enough money or people working on them, so mistakes have crept in that have led to these failures,\" John Pike of the Federation of American Scientists said. \"We have been trying to go to Mars on the cheap - trying to take a 15-gallon trip with just 10 gallons of gas in the tank.\" </p> <p><strong>Mission: possible - just</strong></p> <p>\u0095 Because the orbits are so different - a Martian year lasts 687 earth days - there is a launch window for an economical journey to Mars only once every 18 months </p> <p>\u0095 Temperatures in space can be higher than 100C in direct sunlight and as low as -200C in the shade.

Alas, a tornado exerts an upward force on a building that is 10 times as strong as the force of gravity. \"Anchor bolts are sheared off. Then the roof is lifted from the walls, the walls drop back down and everything falls apart,\" he says. \"If you just throw everything you know at it, you may produce a building that will withstand a tornado.

The cost of cleaning up US hazardous waste sites is put at between $373 bn and $1.6 trillion over the next three decades. This depends on whether engineers go in for \"suck, muck and truck\" solutions, or something simpler. \"If natural attentuation is used instead in appropriate situations, the expense could be significantly reduced.\" </p> <p><strong> At the heart of darkness </strong><br> Black holes are relatively new: nobody has had time to see one either grow old or get bigger. But Michael Merrifield of Nottingham university and Duncan Forbes and Alejandro Terlevich of the university of Birmingham analysed starlight to determine the ages of 23 galaxies, each with a black hole at its heart. The galaxies ranged in age from 4bn years to 12bn years. The black holes at the heart of the young ones were slimline, containing the mass of only about a million suns. The older ones showed signs of having consumed at least a billion suns. \"There is this indirect inference that the black holes are increasing their mass as the galaxies get older,\" said Prof Merrifield.</p>",

Then the roof is lifted from the walls, the walls drop back down and everything falls apart,\" he says. \"If you just throw everything you know at it, you may produce a building that will withstand a tornado. But will anybody be able to afford to live in it?\" The afterglow of uranium Sandia national laboratories in Albuquerque, New Mexico, are thinking of leaving nature - which will lock the stuff up in other minerals if you wait long enough - to sort out uranium contamination. The cost of cleaning up US hazardous waste sites is put at between $373 bn and $1.6 trillion over the next three decades. This depends on whether engineers go in for \"suck, muck and truck\" solutions, or something simpler. \"If natural attentuation is used instead in appropriate situations, the expense could be significantly reduced.\" At the heart of darkness Black holes are relatively new: nobody has had time to see one either grow old or get bigger. But Michael Merrifield of Nottingham university and Duncan Forbes and Alejandro Terlevich of the university of Birmingham analysed starlight to determine the ages of 23 galaxies, each with a black hole at its heart. The galaxies ranged in age from 4bn years to 12bn years. The black holes at the heart of the young ones were slimline, containing the mass of only about a million suns. The older ones showed signs of having consumed at least a billion suns. \"There is this indirect inference that the black holes are increasing their mass as the galaxies get older,\" said Prof Merrifield.",

      "body": "<p>Last Saturday, at a mathematics meeting in Indiana, four mathematicians announced that they had solved a long-standing conundrum about the shape of soap bubbles. Frank Morgan, of Williams college, Michael Hutchins of Stanford university, and Manuel Ritori and Antonio Ros of the university of Granada, in Spain, have, they say, proved the double-bubble conjecture. </p> <p>This says that the two-chambered soap bubble you can see in your bath is the one that has the least surface area compared with any other double-bubble combination enclosing the same two volumes of air. (A computer-generated picture of this double-bubble is shown in the illustration. The conjecture describes its shape precisely.) The conjecture goes back to work of the French mathematician Plateau in 1873, although it was not formulated precisely until a student at Williams College in Massachusetts - Joel Foisy - wrote an undergraduate thesis about soap bubbles in 1991. Since thin soap films adopt the shape that uses the minimum surface area to enclose a given volume of air, the question about the possible shapes of soap bubbles is of interest to both mathematicians and physicists. </p> <p>The first mathematician to think about the geometry of soap bubbles was Archimedes - he of the famous bath story. He claimed that the sphere was the most efficient way to enclose a given volume, but he did not have the mathematics to prove this. That had to wait until a German mathematician called Schwarz found a proof in 1884. </p> <p>The problem gets much harder when you have a cluster of two or more bubbles. Even for two bubbles, it's not obvious what the most efficient shape is, and for a while mathematicians were reduced to creating bubbles from soap solution and studying them as fast as they could before they burst. </p> <p>In 1976, the mathematician Jean Taylor made a remarkable discovery: in any optimal bubble cluster, each individual surface will have constant mean curvature, that these surfaces will meet in threes at an angle of exactly 120 degrees along curves, and those curves will meet in fours at single points. </p> <p>You can create a double bubble by making two individual bubbles and bringing them gently together until they suddenly fuse into a single structure. Whenever mathematicians did this, they found that the resulting configuration consisted of two bubble-shaped chambers separated by a single film. If the two bubbles they started with were the same size, the soap film that separated the two chambers was flat. If one bubble was bigger than the other, the separating surface bulged into the larger of the two. If you try this, you will see that the outer surfaces of the two chambers look spherical. And if you look really carefully, you will see that the curved separating film looks as though it might be part of a sphere as well. </p> <p>Taylor's theorem tells you that, if the bubble is optimal, all three surfaces are indeed perfectly spherical, and meet at exactly 120 degrees along the central join. (If you start with two equal bubbles, the dividing film is flat, but mathematicians, ever resourceful, think of a flat film as the surface of a sphere of infinite radius, so Taylor's theorem still applies.) What mathematicians wanted to know was whether, as is so often the case, Nature had found the most efficient way to do things. </p> <p>Computer simulations produced other shapes that satisfied the conditions of Taylor's theorem, although no one was able to construct them physically using soap films. </p> <p>In 1996, mathematicians Joel Hass and Roger Schafly proved that for a double-bubble where the two chambers have the same volume, the familiar shape was indeed the optimal one. </p> <p>They started out with a mathematical analysis of all the kinds of shapes possible, carried out by Michael Hutchins a few months earlier, using a computer to examine all the possibilities. They were able to show that the familiar one of two spherical chambers separated by a flat film had the least surface area. </p> <p>But the Hass and Schafly approach did not work when the two chambers had different volumes. The new proof that has just been announced does not use a computer at all. Instead, it uses what mathematicians call a stability argument. The researchers look at the way the overall configuration would have to change when individual portions are rotated about suitably chosen axes at different rates. </p> <p>You could not perform these rotations with a real bubble; it would immediately break up. But you can do it mathematically. And when you do, you see that the familiar one is indeed optimal. It was a long haul, but in the end, the double-bubble toil and trouble paid off. </p> <p>The proof of the double-bubble conjecture is just the latest in a recent spate of results in which mathematicians have had to use some sophisticated mathematics to demonstrate that Nature has been doing things the most efficient way all along. </p> <p>For example, just last year, Thomas Hales of the university of Michigan proved that the familiar hexagonal cross-section of a honeycomb is the one that uses the least amount of wax to store the maximum amount of honey. </p> <p>Although this had been conjectured back in the 4th century AD by the Greek mathematician Pappus, it took Hales 19 pages of complicated modern mathematics to prove it. </p> <p>In a similar vein, in 1993, the French mathematicians Stephane Douady and Yves Couder finally showed why it was that the famous Fibonacci numbers keep on appearing in flowers and plants. These are the numbers you get when you start with a pair of 1s and keep on generating new numbers by adding together the last two. So, the sequence starts: 1+1=2, 1+2=3, 2+3=5, 5+8=13. When you keep going, you get the sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, etc. This particular sequence of numbers was first proposed by the great Italian mathematician Leonardo of Pisa in the early 13th century.

Ministers plan to contact all 200 Labour MPs who have criticised the bill - to try and persuade them to support the government in the debate on the bill on April 4 and 5. Mr Straw is said to be holding back more significant changes in case the bill runs into serious trouble in the Lords. Ministers will table the changes today - and add minor amendments.",

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair is to consider creating a powerful new post of cabinet minister for youth after a government report warned that Britain's young people face more problems than their counterparts elsewhere in Europe. The influential social exclusion unit, which has the prime minister's backing, today proposes creating a team of at least two youth ministers who would take personal responsibility for progress in key areas including reducing pregnancies and suicides among young people. The ministers would work across government departments, aiming to coordinate efforts to lift teenagers out of crime, homelessness, mental illness, educational disadvantage and drug abuse. They would be backed by a new youth unit and have a dedicated budget to spend on alleviating the problems of disadvantaged young people. There would also be a cross-departmental ministerial committee on children's and youth affairs. The report, by the unit's youth policy action team, also recommends using a new youth card to give young people incentives for educational achievement. The inducements could include free driving lessons, holiday discounts and free tickets for arts and sports events. Creating the new posts would bring Britain into line with other EU countries which already have dedicated youth ministers. It is likely that, at cabinet-level, the youth responsibility would be attached to an existing portfolio - probably David Blunkett's education brief. The Home Office minister, Paul Boateng, who will launch the exclusion unit's report today, will underline the government's determination to take forward its recommendations. He will say: \"As we enter the 21st century, there can be no more important task facing us than to ensure that, no matter who they are, each young person has the best possible start in life and the opportunity to develop and achieve their full potential.\" The government is concerned that too many young people fall through the gaps between departmental responsibilities. This leaves the government to pick up the pieces once problems arise, rather than acting early to help those at risk. The report will set out 24 recommendations, including requiring government to test all policies for the impact they will have on young people. It says there should be a clear strategy setting out what the government aims to do to tackle exclusion among young people, to be implemented by a new cross-Whitehall youth unit. The government is already conducting a review of spending on young people at risk across departments including education, the Home Office and health. The social exclusion unit proposes creating a ring-fenced budget to fund work to prevent highly disadvantaged young people - including those in care or suffering serious family conflict - sinking into crime or drug dependency. Today's report will set out a typical case study intended to illustrate the kind of deprived young people the youth ministers would aim to help. \"Matthew\" was abused by his step family and bullied at school before sliding into truancy, crime and drugs.

Following on from the launch of Bush's Internet TV (see last week's Online) NTL has announced the summer introduction of its Internet TV decoder. NTL's trump card is that couch potatoes turned netheads will pay only \u00a35 a month to get on line as all internet calls are free. </p> <p>Unlike the Bush Internet TV, the NTL box features an integrated hard disk drive so viewers with digital sets will also be able to record up to 10 hours worth of video, and pause and rewind live programmes. </p> <p>They will also be able to surf the net and watch TV at the same time, and have access to a host of interactive facilities through their sets. </p> <p><strong> Picture this</strong><br> Toshiba has become the latest digital camera manufacturer to join the exclusive triple mega pixel club. The PDR-M70 is capable of a resolution of 3.37 megapixels which makes it a rival to recently launched top-end models from Sony and Olympus. </p> <p>Tosh reckons that the camera's pictures have been significantly improved thanks to a technology called PicTOP (Picture Optimiser). Apparently, this analyses the image in far greater detail to give a more accurate exposure level. The camera also sports video capturing facilities and can archive up to five minutes of moving images with audio. A digital voice recorder capable of taking up to 65 minutes of audio is another key feature. Other facilities include 3x optical and 2x digital zoom, a boot time of less than three seconds and a one second delay between shots, a USB download port, and a Lithium Ion battery. </p> <p>It will be accompanied by the PDR-M60, a basic model targeted at first time buyers. </p> <p>Toshiba has also announced the September arrival of a pair of DVD Audio players, the SD500E and SD900E. The two models will play standard DVDs and CDs as well as new DVD audio discs. The new format has a significantly higher frequency capability and wider dynamic range than standard audio CDs. </p> <p><strong> My TV</strong><br> Fancy downloading video files from the Net to create your own take-anywhere version of MTV? </p> <p>Coming in autumn is the Motion Yepp, a Palm 5 sized gadget from Samsung that will replay MPEG 4 video files on its 2in TFT screen. As well as being a hit with budding VJs, Samsung reckons that touring business types will use it to download videos of their family and then bore fellow travellers with footage of little Johnny's first steps. </p> <p>Due in the early summer is Photo Yepp, an MP3 player than can download JPEG images on to its 2in TFT screen. Perhaps the most interesting model in Samsung's MP3 range is a player built into a pair of headphones. It's called Headphone Yepp, and it will be in the stores in September. </p> <p><strong> Sounds good</strong><br> Watch out, PC geeks: your favourite music format could soon be moving mass-market. Aiwa has announced MM-FX500, the first ever portable MP3 recorder. The model, which goes on sale in Japan in June, features a built-in encoder that compresses audio signals from analogue output terminals on audio equipment to the MP3 format. Users will be able to convert their CDs, vinyl records and cassettes to MP3 without ever having to go near a PC. It will cost around \u00a3275 and is expected to reach the UK later this year. </p> <p>Aiwa's debut UK MP3 player, the MM-VX100, goes on sale next month via <a href=\"http://www.aiwa.co.uk\">Aiwa's website</a> for \u00a3129.99. </p> <p><strong> Movie magic</strong><br> Forget Citizen Kane!

What they really want is quick access to information. I think that's why we're currently seeing such a wealth of people using handhelds not just for a diary or address book but for many other applications. </p> <p><strong> Any new applications you'd like to see on a handheld?</strong> People want high quality sound, good quality graphics and imaging and eventually they're going to want video. I don't think that people will want to sit and watch a movie on their handheld... even though it could be technically possible. I think the wonder of this ride is that quick little burst of information. </p> <p><strong> Any other favourite gadgets?</strong> My mobile is getting much more intelligent and I can now optimise my combination of the smallest phone and the right handheld. Seeing the two work together is probably my gadget of choice. </p> <p><strong> How does e-commerce differ in the US and the UK?</strong> In Europe in particular I see an opportunity for m-commerce or mobile commerce . I'm a big fan of <a href=\"http://www.ebay.com\">eBay</a> and I found that when I started accessing it via my Palm VII (only available in America) my mentality changed dramatically. I use the web-clipping application and get straight to what I want. In fact I think I'm spending a lot more money because it's so accessible. The next step is \"how do I make the payment?\". Sites like <a href=\"http://www.paypal.com\">PayPa</a> are very interesting because they effectively allow me to send money to anyone with an e-mail address. </p> <p><strong> Is there money to be made from e-commerce?</strong> I think the companies that fail are the ones that just try and take their bricks and mortar store and put it on the internet without thinking they should work any differently. </p> <p><strong> Any favourite places on the web?</strong> I'm fascinated by this whole idea of <a href=\"http://www000115.webvan.com/default.asp\" target=\"_new\">Webvan</a>, this idea of convenience and following my shopping habits and grocery lists.

      "bodyText": "Do hand-helds pose a serious threat to the PC? I think there are a number of people for whom even a laptop or a portable computer is still a little too much. What they really want is quick access to information. I think that's why we're currently seeing such a wealth of people using handhelds not just for a diary or address book but for many other applications. Any new applications you'd like to see on a handheld? People want high quality sound, good quality graphics and imaging and eventually they're going to want video. I don't think that people will want to sit and watch a movie on their handheld... even though it could be technically possible. I think the wonder of this ride is that quick little burst of information. Any other favourite gadgets? My mobile is getting much more intelligent and I can now optimise my combination of the smallest phone and the right handheld. Seeing the two work together is probably my gadget of choice. How does e-commerce differ in the US and the UK? In Europe in particular I see an opportunity for m-commerce or mobile commerce . I'm a big fan of eBay and I found that when I started accessing it via my Palm VII (only available in America) my mentality changed dramatically. I use the web-clipping application and get straight to what I want. In fact I think I'm spending a lot more money because it's so accessible. The next step is \"how do I make the payment?\". Sites like PayPa are very interesting because they effectively allow me to send money to anyone with an e-mail address. Is there money to be made from e-commerce? I think the companies that fail are the ones that just try and take their bricks and mortar store and put it on the internet without thinking they should work any differently. Any favourite places on the web? I'm fascinated by this whole idea of Webvan, this idea of convenience and following my shopping habits and grocery lists. It's the kind of thing that just wouldn't have been possible before. I'm really impressed with CNet. I like this concept of being able to do the different comparison services.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>If nothing else, the destruction of the Iridium telephone network's $5 billion constellation of satellites will make a spectacular fireworks display. Four by four, the 66 satellites will be nudged towards the earth from their orbits 485 miles up, to meet a fiery end in the earth's atmosphere. </p> <p>Only a late rescue bid from a consortium of US investors, which wants to use the network to transmit data, could halt the scuttling. Otherwise the very public dismantling of one of the most glamorous and ambitious technology projects of its day will go ahead. </p> <p>Iridium's day was almost certainly before even one of those satellites had been launched. On 26 June 1990, Motorola executive director Donald Bartram unveiled what he promised would be \"the next major milestone in global communications\" allowing \"any person on the planet to communicate with any other.\" </p> <p>It was a bold dream, a multi-billion dollar bet on the quality of the project's own technology and the paucity of competing earthbound alternatives. It also relied on a public so desperate to keep in touch, wherever they were in the world, they would pay thousands for handsets and $9 a minute for calls. </p> <p>In the end, Iridium's defeat on all three fronts was resounding. Despite startup costs of $7bn and a huge marketing spend, there were only around 55,000 people connected to the worldwide network before it was switched off at midnight on Friday. </p> <p>The end had come earlier that day in New York, when lawyer William Perlstein, representing Iridium, told a bankruptcy court: \"We do not have a qualified bid\". </p> <p>With that confirmation that no saviour had been found, despite approaches to 80 firms, it was guaranteed that Iridium would pass into the history books as one of the greatest business debacles ever, finally folding under debts of $4.4 bn. </p> <p>Yet it all seemed such a good plan at first. The idea for a global satellite telephone network came to the wife of Motorola executive Bary Bertiger in the sun-kissed Caribbean in 1985, after she found she could not place a call to the United States. </p> <p>It took five years of research to find a way to bring satellite communications to handsets which were not connected to immensely powerful transmitters. The solution was a large number of low-flying satellites, which would collectively give blanket coverage of the globe. Iridium was launched, with its name borrowed from the element iridium which has the atomic number 77, the number of satellites originally planned. </p> <p>When its service was finally launched in November 1998, Iridium had only 66 satellites, but the world - and especially mobile communications - had moved on during the years of launches, building and haggling between partners which Iridium had to overcome before going live. </p> <p>While, in 1990, large handsets and huge call costs were still the norm for mobiles, by 1998 mobiles had shrunk and the costs of ownership plunged to the extent they were almost ubiquitous. </p> <p>To add to Iridium's problems, the GSM standard had been adopted in many parts of the world, and most major cities were well served by terrestrial mobile telephone companies. The worldwide agreement on UTMS as the next global mobile standard was a further blow. </p> <p>Iridium's technology also appeared laughably old fashioned in the fast-paced mobile world. At a time when the most fashionable mobile handset was the cigarette packet-sized StarTac (made, ironically, by Motorola) Iridium's handsets were brick sized - throwbacks to the early days of mobile communication in the 1980s. </p> <p>The giant handsets didn't work particularly well, either, as journalists and aid workers discovered last year when the Kosovo crisis erupted.

      "bodyText": "If nothing else, the destruction of the Iridium telephone network's $5 billion constellation of satellites will make a spectacular fireworks display. Four by four, the 66 satellites will be nudged towards the earth from their orbits 485 miles up, to meet a fiery end in the earth's atmosphere. Only a late rescue bid from a consortium of US investors, which wants to use the network to transmit data, could halt the scuttling. Otherwise the very public dismantling of one of the most glamorous and ambitious technology projects of its day will go ahead. Iridium's day was almost certainly before even one of those satellites had been launched. On 26 June 1990, Motorola executive director Donald Bartram unveiled what he promised would be \"the next major milestone in global communications\" allowing \"any person on the planet to communicate with any other.\" It was a bold dream, a multi-billion dollar bet on the quality of the project's own technology and the paucity of competing earthbound alternatives. It also relied on a public so desperate to keep in touch, wherever they were in the world, they would pay thousands for handsets and $9 a minute for calls. In the end, Iridium's defeat on all three fronts was resounding. Despite startup costs of $7bn and a huge marketing spend, there were only around 55,000 people connected to the worldwide network before it was switched off at midnight on Friday. The end had come earlier that day in New York, when lawyer William Perlstein, representing Iridium, told a bankruptcy court: \"We do not have a qualified bid\". With that confirmation that no saviour had been found, despite approaches to 80 firms, it was guaranteed that Iridium would pass into the history books as one of the greatest business debacles ever, finally folding under debts of $4.4 bn. Yet it all seemed such a good plan at first. The idea for a global satellite telephone network came to the wife of Motorola executive Bary Bertiger in the sun-kissed Caribbean in 1985, after she found she could not place a call to the United States. It took five years of research to find a way to bring satellite communications to handsets which were not connected to immensely powerful transmitters. The solution was a large number of low-flying satellites, which would collectively give blanket coverage of the globe. Iridium was launched, with its name borrowed from the element iridium which has the atomic number 77, the number of satellites originally planned. When its service was finally launched in November 1998, Iridium had only 66 satellites, but the world - and especially mobile communications - had moved on during the years of launches, building and haggling between partners which Iridium had to overcome before going live. While, in 1990, large handsets and huge call costs were still the norm for mobiles, by 1998 mobiles had shrunk and the costs of ownership plunged to the extent they were almost ubiquitous. To add to Iridium's problems, the GSM standard had been adopted in many parts of the world, and most major cities were well served by terrestrial mobile telephone companies. The worldwide agreement on UTMS as the next global mobile standard was a further blow. Iridium's technology also appeared laughably old fashioned in the fast-paced mobile world. At a time when the most fashionable mobile handset was the cigarette packet-sized StarTac (made, ironically, by Motorola) Iridium's handsets were brick sized - throwbacks to the early days of mobile communication in the 1980s. The giant handsets didn't work particularly well, either, as journalists and aid workers discovered last year when the Kosovo crisis erupted. They found there was no signal at all indoors, and that even outside conversations would be cut short after a few minutes. Sailors - one of the big niche markets targeted by Iridium - found that they lost their signal if rigging moved in the wind and obstructed the line between phone and satellite. Those failings did not deter lone oarsman Jo Le Guen, 52, who bought an Iridium phone to take with him as he rowed 4,500 miles across the south Pacific to raise awareness of ocean pollution. The father of five planned to use his phone as his primary means of communication, useful for discussing the violent weather scouring the south Pacific with his router in Paris. Le Guen set off on his epic journey on February 3 from Wellington, New Zealand, more than a month before Motorola's warning that Iridium would cut customers off on Friday 17th if a buyer could not be found. As Online went to press, it was unclear how long his Iridium phone would continue to work: the company says its satellite network will continue to work \"for some time\" for vulnerable clients, but that earth based gateways, run by separate companies, could choose to shut down, cutting Le Guen off. Le Guen's team already fears the worst for its satellite link, and is frantically searching for a ship which might pass near to Le Guen's nine metre boat, in order to pass on a new mobile, supplied by Iridium's erstwhile rival GlobalStar. \"We are still able to talk to Jo,\" says Phillipe Tuffigo, a member of Le Guen's Paris-based support team, earlier this week. \"But we are not sure how much longer the phone will work.\" The phone has proved invaluable, says Tuffigo, because force 8-9 gales and mountainous seas have made it too difficult for Le Guen to climb his mast and set up an antenna for an alternative means of communication. \"Iridium have said they will continue for a short while, but May is far too long a time away,\" says Tuffigo. Meanwhile, back in New York, the post-mortems on one of the world's biggest business failures continue. Some analysts are drawing parallels between today's internet boom and the huge optimism for Iridium when it first launched. Others say Motorola just bet too much, too early, on one technology. \"They zigged and the world zagged,\" Paul Saffo, director of the Institute of the Future, told the New York Times last week. Others appear to be in denial about the viability of satellite telephony, despite the technological problems and poor takeup. Motorola insisted until the end that a market of up to 40m subscribers would exist by 2005. And some industry observers are now looking ahead to the launches of other satellite technologies from companies like GlobalStar, Teledesic, SkyBridge and Spaceway, which plan to beam internet services to businesses and households, and asking how they will fare. They point to the fact that these new companies, just as Iridium did five years ago, are now facing formidable terrestrial competition, this time from cable and traditional telephone companies.

His teaching began in Birmingham and then, mainly geography, at St Albans grammar school. Caught up in the immediate post-war need to provide teachers, he joined the staff at Daneshill College, an emergency training college, and then became a staff member at Kesteven College. He was then one of the first members of staff at the University College of North Staffordshire (now Keele University) after which he moved to Manchester University's education department. Like many before him, Alan transferred his focus from training secondary teachers to the preparation of teachers for the primary years. His early researches were on education as a social process, on how knowledge, skills and interests developed in young children, and how small social groupings affected their motivation. After his retirement from Liverpool in 1983 he remained active. The post-1988 national curriculum largely ignored his ideas, but many of these have now returned: the development of economic and industrial understanding is now advocated for the primary curriculum, the teaching of citizenship will be initated from 2001. During the 1960s and early 1970s Alan was an adviser to the Liberal party. A man with deep Christian beliefs, in his last years he led a study group on the place of the humanities in the primary curriculum. He never allowed his intellectual power to unfairly affect his judgment; he met conflict with reason. Primary education has lost one of its greatest champions but, quietly and effectively, he passed the torch on to a new generation. He is survived by his wife Joan - whom he married in 1948 - and their son, Richard. \u0095 William Alan Lansdell Blyth, educationalist, born July 7 1921; died March 12 2000",

      "body": "<p>Robert Welch, who has died aged 70, was one of the star designers of his period who defined the British \u201ccontemporary\u201d style. Old Hall stainless steel candlesticks, the Westclox alarm clock, Alveston cutlery and the Chantry knife sharpener were all cult objects of the late 1950s and early 1960s. Welch adapted his skills as a craft silversmith to become one of the leaders in industrial design. </p> <p>Though enormously sophisticated as a designer, Bob Welch was a country person through and through, loving English village architecture, pubs and cricket matches, the rhythms of small town rural life. He was rooted in the middle west of England, born in Hereford. His mother was a painter. He trained in drawing, painting and silversmithing, first at Malvern School of Art and then at Birmingham College of Art, where he met and later married a fellow student, Patricia Hinksman. Drawing remained the central discipline of Welch\u2019s design practice, and he returned to painting, filling large bright canvases in a sudden new creative burst of energy in the last few years before his death. </p> <p>He was fortunate in arriving at the Royal College of Art in London in 1952, the year after the Festival of Britain, an event which nearly achieved the impossible in converting the British to modernity. The RCA itself was in an optimistic phase with a new and forward-looking rector, Robin Darwin. </p> <p>Welch was enrolled in the silversmithing school under a famous professor, Robert Goodden. The jewellers and silversmiths who emerged from this department brought about a remarkable mid-20th century renaissance of British metalwork design. </p> <p>As a student, Robert Welch made two extended visits to Scandinavia, studying design in Stockholm and working with the silversmith Theodor Olsen in Bergen. The experience made a great impression. Of the British designers of his generation, Welch was the most clearly influenced by Scandinavia in his functional precision, his love of the clean line. He was especially excited by his discovery of Scandinavian modern stainless steel, as developed in neutral Sweden in the war years by the Gense factory. He began to see it as his mission to design an equivalent modern British range of stainless steel. </p> <p>In his final year at the RCA, Welch made contact with J&amp;J Wiggin, a small family firm in Bloxwich, north of Birmingham, at that time the only British manufacturer of stainless steel tableware, marketed under the name Old Hall. In 1955 he was appointed Wiggins\u2019 design consultant, an association which lasted until the firm closed down in 1984. </p> <p>Welch\u2019s work for Old Hall made him the darling of the Council of Industrial Design (now the Design Council), the official body set up to raise standards of consumer goods. Campden cutlery, co-designed in 1957 with my husband David Mellor, his RCA contemporary, was the first modern cutlery in stainless steel to be produced in Britain. Welch\u2019s pristine coffee pots and toast racks are now being recycled in the galleries and salerooms as design classics of their time. </p> <p>In 1955 Welch made another crucial move, settling in Chipping Campden, the most breathtakingly beautiful small town of the Cotswolds. For designs Chipping Campden has powerful resonance. There are local connections with William Morris and with his disciple CR Ashbee, the Arts and Crafts idealist; who made the Old Silk Mill in Campden his headquarters when he brought his Guild of Handi craft from London to Gloucestershire in 1902. </p> <p>Sir Gordon Russell, pioneering modernist furniture manufacturer and director of the Council of Industrial Design, lived up the hill at Kingcombe, his almost hand-built house. It was Russell who suggested that Welch might find a workspace at the Silk Mill. He moved into the top floor, with his little truckle bed. Two floors down, one of Ashbee\u2019s original silversmiths, George Hart, aged 83, was still at work.

      "bodyText": "Robert Welch, who has died aged 70, was one of the star designers of his period who defined the British \u201ccontemporary\u201d style. Old Hall stainless steel candlesticks, the Westclox alarm clock, Alveston cutlery and the Chantry knife sharpener were all cult objects of the late 1950s and early 1960s. Welch adapted his skills as a craft silversmith to become one of the leaders in industrial design. Though enormously sophisticated as a designer, Bob Welch was a country person through and through, loving English village architecture, pubs and cricket matches, the rhythms of small town rural life. He was rooted in the middle west of England, born in Hereford. His mother was a painter. He trained in drawing, painting and silversmithing, first at Malvern School of Art and then at Birmingham College of Art, where he met and later married a fellow student, Patricia Hinksman. Drawing remained the central discipline of Welch\u2019s design practice, and he returned to painting, filling large bright canvases in a sudden new creative burst of energy in the last few years before his death. He was fortunate in arriving at the Royal College of Art in London in 1952, the year after the Festival of Britain, an event which nearly achieved the impossible in converting the British to modernity. The RCA itself was in an optimistic phase with a new and forward-looking rector, Robin Darwin. Welch was enrolled in the silversmithing school under a famous professor, Robert Goodden. The jewellers and silversmiths who emerged from this department brought about a remarkable mid-20th century renaissance of British metalwork design. As a student, Robert Welch made two extended visits to Scandinavia, studying design in Stockholm and working with the silversmith Theodor Olsen in Bergen. The experience made a great impression. Of the British designers of his generation, Welch was the most clearly influenced by Scandinavia in his functional precision, his love of the clean line. He was especially excited by his discovery of Scandinavian modern stainless steel, as developed in neutral Sweden in the war years by the Gense factory. He began to see it as his mission to design an equivalent modern British range of stainless steel. In his final year at the RCA, Welch made contact with J&amp;J Wiggin, a small family firm in Bloxwich, north of Birmingham, at that time the only British manufacturer of stainless steel tableware, marketed under the name Old Hall. In 1955 he was appointed Wiggins\u2019 design consultant, an association which lasted until the firm closed down in 1984. Welch\u2019s work for Old Hall made him the darling of the Council of Industrial Design (now the Design Council), the official body set up to raise standards of consumer goods. Campden cutlery, co-designed in 1957 with my husband David Mellor, his RCA contemporary, was the first modern cutlery in stainless steel to be produced in Britain. Welch\u2019s pristine coffee pots and toast racks are now being recycled in the galleries and salerooms as design classics of their time. In 1955 Welch made another crucial move, settling in Chipping Campden, the most breathtakingly beautiful small town of the Cotswolds. For designs Chipping Campden has powerful resonance. There are local connections with William Morris and with his disciple CR Ashbee, the Arts and Crafts idealist; who made the Old Silk Mill in Campden his headquarters when he brought his Guild of Handi craft from London to Gloucestershire in 1902. Sir Gordon Russell, pioneering modernist furniture manufacturer and director of the Council of Industrial Design, lived up the hill at Kingcombe, his almost hand-built house. It was Russell who suggested that Welch might find a workspace at the Silk Mill. He moved into the top floor, with his little truckle bed. Two floors down, one of Ashbee\u2019s original silversmiths, George Hart, aged 83, was still at work. When I went to visit Welch on a sunny, windy day in 1965, soon after I had joined the Guardian as design correspondent, the sense of continuity was almost tangible. Apart from some rather controversial lavatories for British Rail, Welch\u2019s practice was highly concentrated on domestic design.

If Uncle Sam was America and Marianne was the personification of France, Dosh reasoned, then Srulik, a little boy in a sun hat, would represent the new state of Israel. The cartoon continued until his death.</p> <p>Dosh belonged to that East European cultural milieu eradicated by the Nazis. He became Israel's best-known cartoonist. Born Menachem Goldberger in Budapest, during the second world war he was imprisoned in Hungarian and Yugoslav labour camps. With the Axis's defeat looming, Dosh was among a group of 3,000 Jewish boy slave labourers the Nazis marched to a brick factory and began to shoot. Dosh ran, escaped, and joined the partisans. At liberation he returned to Budapest to discover he was the only member of his family left alive. His parents perished on a death march to Germany.</p> <p>Post-war, after studying literature and philosophy in Hungary and six months in a German displaced persons' camp, he entered France illegally. In Paris, he studied at the Sorbonne and encountered Jean-Paul Sartre, the Romanian playwright Eugene Ionesco and fellow-Hungarian Arthur Koestler.</p> <p>Dosh had embraced right-wing Zionism. He joined the terrorists of Lehi, illustrating their weekly Mas-Lehi. He arrived in Haifa in March 1948. From April to July he was imprisoned, following Lehi's murder of the United Nations emissary Count Folke Bernadotte.</p> <p>Much later, by now established as a cartoonist, Dosh served in the army and was deeply marked by being one of the first soldiers into Arab Jerusalem during the 1967 six day war.

      "bodyText": "In 1953 Kariel Gardosch, who has died aged 78 and worked under the pen-name \"Dosh\", was invited to produce a daily cartoon by the editor of the leading Israeli newspaper Ma-ariv. If Uncle Sam was America and Marianne was the personification of France, Dosh reasoned, then Srulik, a little boy in a sun hat, would represent the new state of Israel. The cartoon continued until his death. Dosh belonged to that East European cultural milieu eradicated by the Nazis. He became Israel's best-known cartoonist. Born Menachem Goldberger in Budapest, during the second world war he was imprisoned in Hungarian and Yugoslav labour camps. With the Axis's defeat looming, Dosh was among a group of 3,000 Jewish boy slave labourers the Nazis marched to a brick factory and began to shoot. Dosh ran, escaped, and joined the partisans. At liberation he returned to Budapest to discover he was the only member of his family left alive. His parents perished on a death march to Germany. Post-war, after studying literature and philosophy in Hungary and six months in a German displaced persons' camp, he entered France illegally. In Paris, he studied at the Sorbonne and encountered Jean-Paul Sartre, the Romanian playwright Eugene Ionesco and fellow-Hungarian Arthur Koestler. Dosh had embraced right-wing Zionism. He joined the terrorists of Lehi, illustrating their weekly Mas-Lehi. He arrived in Haifa in March 1948. From April to July he was imprisoned, following Lehi's murder of the United Nations emissary Count Folke Bernadotte. Much later, by now established as a cartoonist, Dosh served in the army and was deeply marked by being one of the first soldiers into Arab Jerusalem during the 1967 six day war. In the volatile early 1980s, he was cultural attach\u00e9 to London's Israeli Embassy during the right-wing Menachem Begin government. Dosh was always associated with the Israeli right, and when Yitzhak Rabin's Labour party came to power Dosh was pushed out of political cultural circles: an alienation which caused him much pain. But, on Israel's 50th anniversary in l998, he was honoured when a Srulik stamp was commissioned by the Rabin government to honour his achievement. Although a rightist, he was also a secular, pragmatic Jew. He and Tova Pardo, the Bulgarian-born actress and his partner for more than 30 years, entertained artists and intellectuals from across the spectrum.

      "bodyText": "Nelson Mandela, the former president of South Africa, has reacted angrily to a claim that he was recruited as an \"agent of influence\" by British intelligence and that he visited MI6 in Britain to thank them for their help in foiling assassination attempts. \"I never visited the headquarters of any intelligence service,\" he told the Guardian yesterday. The allegations were made in the forthcoming book, MI6: Fifty Years of Special Operations, by Stephen Dorril, a lecturer at Huddersfield University, and they were met by strong denials earlier this week from Pretoria. \"False and nonsensical allegations against Nelson Mandela appearing in the British media and emanating from shadowy rightwing forces have been repeatedly made in a futile attempt to tarnish his image,\" the government said. \"The allegations are baseless and are motivated by a difficulty in accepting that individuals other those from the 'first world' can play an important part in world affairs.\" \"Some, like those making [the book's] allegations, do not realise that the colonial era is past - never to return,\" it said. The tone of the government's response reflected Mr Mandela's indignation at whites and westerners who claim credit for the achievements of the African National Congress - which led the anti-apartheid struggle in South Africa - and those who cannot believe that Africans can take serious initiatives on their own. \"They show a contempt for Africa,\" he said. It is no secret that, after Mr Mandela's release from prison in 1991, British intelligence gave some assistance to the ANC; Lord Renwick, who was British ambassador to Pretoria at the time, confirmed that he asked British intelligence experts to train Mr Mandela's bodyguards and advise on security at his home. \"The intelligence service were involved in these activities, for which Mr Mandela was very grateful,\" Lord Renwick said. \"But there is no truth in the suggestion that the relationship went deeper than that.\" The report that Mr Mandela was recruited is \"an absolute travesty\", he said. British intelligence sources were equally dismissive. \"The idea that we recruited Mandela is crap,\" said one official. British agents were certainly involved with the exiled ANC in Lusaka, Zambia, in the years before Mr Mandela's release; they established close relations with the black leadership and were seen as being to the left of British official policy. At a time when Margaret Thatcher - prime minister from 1979-90 - was forbidding British diplomats to have contacts with the ANC, MI6 had its own connections to the movement and gave it information. And while Mrs Thatcher was supporting the South African Zulu leader, Mangosuthu Buthelezi, as an alternative to the ANC, MI6 agents took the ANC more seriously. But Mr Mandela was in prison at that time. And prison officials were, he says, \"very strict about contacts with the world outside, as the prison records show\". In his book, Mr Dorril says it was \"not clear\" whether Mr Mandela was recruited in London before he was imprisoned in South Africa. But from the evidence of British diplomatic files, it is quite clear that he was not. Those records show that British officials were remarkably uninterested in the ANC and uninformed about Mr Mandela, even after he became one of the most important black leaders. It was not until June 1961 that the Foreign Office opened a file on Mr Mandela and, thereafter, its interest was only sporadic; it kept some tracks of his movements when he fled the country in 1962. When he came to London in June 1962, he was questioned by an immigration official who evidently knew something about him. He was surprised to notice the same official watching him when he left 10 days later, but he had no contact with anyone in government while in London. By the time he was arrested and jailed in August 1962, Mr Mandela had still not made contact with any British diplomat or agent: \"I don't think they knew I existed,\" he said yesterday. When he made his final speech before being sentenced to life imprisonment in 1964, the information and research department in London - the offshoot of MI6 set up to provide anticommunist propaganda - belatedly recognised that \"he was going to be popular figure over the whole continent whether we like it or not\". There was still no record to suggest that the agency had a special relationship with him. During Mr Mandela's ensuing 27 years in prison, British intelligence remained very cautious about making contact with black politicians inside South Africa, knowing such overtures would antagonise the apartheid government. In fact, an MI6 agent was severely interrogated by the South Africans and declared persona non grata after it was discovered that contact had been made with the white opposition, There was some evidence that MI6 had frustrated an attempt by the South African secret service, BOSS, to allow Mr Mandela to be \"rescued\" from Robben Island and flown to the mainland, where he would be killed supposedly escaping. But the scope for British intelligence remained strictly limited by BOSS and it was unable to make contact with Mr Mandela in prison. Mr Dorril also claimed, in an interview with Scotland's Sunday Herald last weekend, that Mr Mandela helped provide MI6 with information about Libya's funding and arming of the IRA. He was said to have picked up the information when he was persuading the Libyan president, Muammar Gadafy, to hand over for trial the Libyan suspects in the Lockerbie air liner bombing.

      "bodyText": "Orang-utans will be extinct in the wild in five to 10 years if rain forest destruction continues at its present level, scientists warn in an alarming report on the large hairy orange primate. This is more than 10 times quicker than the prediction in a survey completed by the World Wide Fund for Nature 18 months ago, and has prompted environmentalists to lobby for the animal's immediate classification as critically endangered. The data has been collated by Carel van Schaik of Duke University in the United States, along with Kathryn Monk and Yarrow Robertson, who are in charge of the Leuser ecosystem management project in the north of Sumatra. It shows that the population of orang-utans (Malay for \"people of the forest\") has declined by about 1,000 a year in Sumatra since 1998, due to accelerated habitat loss caused by rampant logging and forest conversion. They estimate that the current orang-utan population on the island is no more than 5,500. \"We did not realise before that their habitat was under such threat from logging and conversion to oil palm,\" Ms Monk said. \"The highest densities are found in lowland swamps and these are disappearing, as fast as the forests.\" Population figures for Borneo, the only other area where orang-utans live in the wild, are harder to calculate because much of the island is impenetrable. But scientists believe that the death rate there is probably higher than in Sumatra, because Borneo was affected much worse by forest fires in 1997 and 1998. At least 350 young orang-utans have been taken to rehabilitation centres in Borneo in the last 18 months, according to Ashley Leiman, director of the Orang-utan Foundation in London. \"For every one that is brought in there are probably at least another six that have been killed,\" she said. Ms Leiman said there were about 8,000-12,000 orang-utans left in the wild in Borneo. Scientists estimate that the orang-utan population has almost halved since 1993. \"The problem is the [Indonesian government's] policy, or lack of it, on forest conversion,\" Ms Monk said. \"All of Sumatra and the southern two-thirds of Borneo, called Kalimantan, are in Indonesia.\" Not only is illegal logging and illegal conversion to oil palm plantations uncontrolled in many areas of Indonesia and Kalimantan, corruption is so rife that companies are acquiring permits to clear areas that are meant to remain untouched. Ms Monk said: \"Nowhere is fully protected anymore because national parks are being logged as well.\" She said the situation in Malaysia was not as critical because there was little illegal logging in protected areas. \"But forest outside these areas is being cleared as quickly as in Indonesia.\" The orang-utan's slow rate of reproduction and the large area it needs to live have contributed to the problem. Orang-utans rarely reproduce before they are 12 years old, and then have babies on average only once every eight years. Population densities are usually three animals per square kilometre of virgin forest and one per square kilometre of secondary forest. This year international donors were on the verge of threatening to suspend aid to Jakarta unless the government reined in the illegal loggers. In recent weeks some steps have been taken, but foreign forestry experts in Jakarta say that there has been little meaningful change, mainly because in practically all areas the army and police are heavily involved in the illegal trade. Government officials sent to investigate illegal logging in Tanjung Putting national park recently were forced to flee for their lives after being threatened by the loggers. Environmentalists in Britain are so alarmed by the crisis that they are writing this week to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature to demand that the orang-utan's official classification be changed from vulnerable to critically endangered. \"This step is crucial because it is definitely not a sustainable population in the current conditions, as you're talking about 45 years for three generations,\" Ms Leiman said.",

      "bodyText": "A fugitive accused of four murders was shot dead by police yesterday after he fell asleep, allowing his hostages to escape. Lynn Whitehead and Andy McCord climbed out of a window, leaving Mr McCord's 12-year-old son Bradley behind, after Joseph Palczynski dozed off on the fourth day of the stand-off. That gave police in Dundalk, a suburb of Baltimore, Maryland, the signal to move in, free the sleeping boy and shoot 31-year-old Palczynski, an unemployed electrician with a history of mental illness. He had stormed into the apartment on Friday, after being arrested three weeks ago and bailed on charges of beating his ex-girlfriend Tracy, the daughter of Ms Whitehead. Three days after he was bailed the couple to whom Tracy had fled were dead and she had been kidnapped. A neighbour who tried to help her was shot dead. Tracy escaped the next day and another woman was killed as Palczynski stole a car. A week later he turned up at the apartment in Dundalk. A police spokesman, Bill Toohey, said that the officers had to go in once the hostages had escaped. \"They knew there was one 12-year-old boy in there and a man who had murdered four people.\" Palczynski said in a phone call to a television station that police would not let him speak to to Tracy: \"I love. I did not mean to kill those people. I've been begging them to allow me to talk to Tracy. I will surrender peacefully.\"",

      "body": "<p>San Salvador. In the bright morning sunlight of March 24 1980, a car stopped outside the Church of the Divine Providence. A lone gunman stepped out, unhurried. Resting his rifle on the car door, he aimed carefully down the long aisle to where El Salvador's archbishop, Oscar Arnulfo Romero, was saying mass. A single shot rang out. Romero staggered and fell. The blood pumped from his heart, soaking the little white disks of scattered host.</p> <p>Romero's murder was to become one of the most notorious unsolved crimes of the cold war. The motive was clear. He was the most outspoken voice against the death squad slaughter gathering steam in the US backyard. The ranks of El Salvador's leftwing rebels were being swelled by priests who preached that the poor should seek justice in this world, not wait for the next. Romero was the \"voice of those without voice\", telling soldiers not to kill.</p> <p>The US vowed to make punishment of the archbishop's killers a priority. It could hardly do otherwise as President Reagan launched the largest US war effort since Vietnam to defeat the rebels. He needed support in Washington, which meant showing that crimes like shooting archbishops and nuns would not be tolerated.</p> <p>The ordering of the murder was blamed on the bogeyman of the story, a military intelligence officer called Major Roberto D'Aubuisson who had, conveniently for Washington, recently left the army. In the weeks before the murder, he was repeatedly on television using military intelligence files to denounce \"guerrillas\". Those he accused were often murdered. Romero was near the top of the list.</p> <p>But US promises to bring justice came to nothing. With no trigger-man, gun or witnesses, officials claimed lack of evidence. D'Aubuisson went on to become one of El Salvador's most successful politicians before throat cancer killed him at the end of the civil war 12 years later - the revenge of God, many concluded.</p> <p>However, new evidence suggests that Washington not only knew far more about the killing than it admitted - but also did nothing to investigate for fear of jeopardising its war effort. Vital evidence was ignored. Key witnesses, including the most likely gunman, were killed by those supposed to be investigating.</p> <p>Seven years and 50,000 deaths after Romero's murder, I was feeling out of my depth as a novice reporter sitting on a park bench talking to a young deserter from Major D'Aubuisson's death squads who called himself Jorge. In 1984, he told me, he had guarded a safe house for three former guerrillas nicknamed the Little Angels. They spent their days with prostitutes, smoking marijuana and playing rock music at full volume. At night, they sallied out to capture and kill their former rebel comrades.</p> <p>The men received orders from a National Police detective, Oscar Perez Linares, who came to the house. A man of few words, he was treated by the others with the respect reserved for those not afraid to kill. Several times, Jorge heard the others laughing at how Linares had shot Romero. Linares sat with a half-smile. \"You should have seen the blood that came from that priest!\" was his only comment.</p> <p>At the time, Jorge's story was impossible to check - although the rest of what he said turned out to be true. After the war, I looked in declassified CIA files. Sure enough, in mid-1983, an unusually detailed CIA report, quoting a senior Salvadoran police source, named Linares as a member of a four-man National Police squad which murdered Romero. Other Salvadoran officers said the same thing. And the man who drove the car which took the killer to the church also picked out a photo-fit of Linares. So why, if the CIA had such evidence, and solving the murder was such a priority, was nothing done?</p> <p>Linares was not just any detective. Nor were the Little Angels simple ex-guerrillas. Before the war, when D'Aubuisson ran El Salvador's intelligence agency ANSESAL - set up by the CIA to guard against Communist infiltration of its hemisphere - Linares was one of his most successful agents, infiltrating the fledgling rebel groups. One of his best spies inside rebel ranks was the head of the Little Angels, who Jorge knew as El Negro.</p> <p>After the war, I tracked down El Negro's former rebel comrades. He had been a top guerrilla leader, trained in Cuba. But he was, they said, a traitor. In the years following Romero's murder, he helped to systematically destroy the rebels in western El Salvador, where thousands of leftist sympathisers were murdered. He betrayed gun-running units in neighbouring countries and led guerrilla columns into ambushes. The operation continued even after 1982, when the rebels realised El Negro was a traitor and he fled their ranks. For the next three years, he and Linares led police units which dismantled the rebels in the capital. Some rebel survivors described how El Negro would appear during torture sessions. \"Remember the time we were together in Cuba?\" he would say.</p> <p>This was not a death squad rabble, but rather a highly structured and effective dirty war in which the Americans were closely involved. The much-blamed death squads, like the White Hand and the Secret Anti-Communist Army, never existed as more than exotic names used to sow terror. Military and police intelligence, as CIA reports from 1983 make clear, did the killing. The CIA should have known. It helped the police throughout this period, contracting in urban intelligence experts.</p> <p>\"They would sit next door and write out the questions, leaving it up to the Salvadorans to extract the information,\" said Gerardo Le Chevalier, a senior Salvadoran official at the time. Neither was Major D'Aubuisson the boss. He played the bogeyman very well, leading political rallies to sing his party's anthem.</p> <p>\"El Salvador will be the tomb where the reds end up!\" he would shout. But the major always denied his organisation was behind all the bloodshed. \"Who do you think I am, Superman?\" he barked at us when confronted with his death squad record. And, indeed, far too many units were involved for the major to have had control. It was rather the policy of the generals and colonels at the top of the army. In 1980, when Romero was murdered, the major was coordinating closely with the small clique of rightwing generals and colonels struggling to keep the army under their control. D'Aubuisson may have ordered the killing. But it is very unlikely he did so alone.</p> <p>Several US military men told me they could not get rid of the senior officers with the worst human rights records without risking the whole war. The US had no access to spies like El Negro Mario. The Salvadorans, who never really trusted their US backers, kept that for themselves. Linares and the Little Angels moved from safe house to safe house. US officials said that to clean up the army would have fatally demoralised it. More to the point, it would have lost its eyes and ears.</p> <p>By late 1983, however, the dirty war was running out of steam. The army was now losing a conventional war in the mountains - against well-armed guerrillas who could not be arrested and murdered in the middle of the night. Reagan desperately needed Congress to grant more military aid, which meant cleaning up the Salvadoran army's image.</p> <p>Vice President George Bush and his aid Lt Col Oliver North were dispatched to El Salvador. Later Bush claimed he faced down the death squads. In fact, he met with the Salvadoran high command. Afterwards, North slipped them a list of nine names the Americans wanted removed from the army. Linares was one of the names.</p> <p>His end came three years later, in 1986. By now, he and the Little Angels were kidnapping rich businessmen who refused to pay towards keeping the clandestine intelligence operation going. The kidnappers would pretend to be guerrillas. But some victims recognised the voices of army officers talking outside their rat-infested cells. The FBI and the National Police were sent to investigate.</p> <p>Linares, El Negro Mario and the others were quickly identified. Linares was arrested after fleeing to Guatemala by a special police unit the Americans set up to investigate human rights crimes - particularly Romero's murder. They killed him on the way back to San Salvador. El Negro Mario was also captured and killed. \"They knew far too much to live,\" was the verdict of one top Salvadoran officer.</p> <p>The details of Romero's murder, as well as thousands of others, went to the grave with them.</p>",

The independent chair of that inquiry has confirmed that the agencies have indeed acted upon her recommendations.\" On the sentences passed on the couple, Mr Bowman said, \"I recognise that for the public these sentences may seem wholly inadequate, but I also recognise the constraints faced by the judge. I applaud the seriousness of the judge's remarks about the significance of neglect ...\" \u0095 In an article about universities and ethical investment, page 13, Guardian Education, March 21, we misspelt the name of the green officer of Cambridge University Student Union.

Apologies. \u0095 There was an unfortunate slip in our version of Sylvia Plath's poem Lady Lazarus, page 19, Guardian Weekend, March 18, in which \"Bright as a Nazi lampshade\" became \"Bright as a Naxi lampshade\" \u0095 In our report of the British Press Awards, page 1, yesterday, the phrase \"informative and eminently readable critique\" was our summary of the judges' remarks about the work of Nick Davies, reporter of the year, and not a direct quotation from their statement. \u0095 Mishearing department, from page 11, yesterday, \"There would also be regular reports prepared of each bird's progress and its prodigy.\" We should have said progeny (unlike the last time we misused prodigy; on that occasion we meant prot\u00e9g\u00e9).

      "body": "<p><strong> The instant museum piece </strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Last year Bernardine Evaristo was poet-in-residence at the Museum of London. This is an unpublished poem, Routes.</strong> </p> <p>Time has frozen this midwinter night. Outside </p> <p>the pavement coated with a transparent skin, </p> <p>I retreat into down, sensing the vibration </p> <p>of polar sheets creeping south, burying </p> <p>us a thousand feet under blue ice, diverting </p> <p>the river out of the Vale of St Albans </p> <p>into the London Basin. Welcome home. Welcome </p> <p>first citizen, chasing reindeer over the hip joint </p> <p>with France, tropical and glacier cycles, waves </p> <p>of migrators - your long trek north, from below </p> <p>the Sahara, circling a camp fire by the Thames </p> <p>the hair of wolves over tight backs; dread- </p> <p>locked beards, un-polished eyes, your slow, </p> <p>heavy mouths chewing fresh rhinoceros, roasted, </p> <p>no spices; unaware that you are dislocating </p> <p>from France as you eat, that the Channel is rising, </p> <p>that my heated body floats above a London of birch </p> <p>and pine forest, of open grassland where gangs </p> <p>of straight-tusked elephants gather in Trafalgar </p> <p>Square, hippopotami wallow in the brown marshes </p> <p>of Pall Mall and from Marble Arch I gaze longingly </p> <p>on sheets of marigold, meadowsweet, mint. </p> <p> Unless some wealthy philanthropist surfaces with a craving for couplets at checkouts and quatrains on bin bags, the most successful and popular campaign in the history of British poetry is about to come to a full stop. </p> <p>Over the past two years, Poetry Places, a scheme organised by the Poetry Society to get poets out of their ivory towers and into the workplace, has brought poems to the public in the most unlikely places: poems on greaseproof wrappers in Wigan chip shops, poems printed on refuse sacks in Norfolk, poems on spikes among the plants in a botanical garden, and poems on walls, bus shelters and beaches. </p> <p>The two-year programme, the brainchild of outgoing Poetry Society director Chris Meade, attracted the highest ever arts lottery grant for literature: \u00a3450,000. But now the time is up and the money is gone; the final grants have been allocated, and the last poets-in-residence are taking their places. They include: Benjamin Zephaniah, who will shadow Michael Mansfield QC through his court appearances, and, if the clients agree, through his private consultations; James Crowden, who will work at Wheal Jane tin mine in Cornwall; Christine Hemp, who will be in Lambeth, south London, trying to hold a poetic line between police officers and young people judged at risk of becoming offenders; and Antrim-born poet Brendan Cleary, who will take up a post in one of the oldest working cinemas in the country, the 1910 Duke of York's in Brighton, where they hope to put poems on screen between films. </p> <p>The project has generated unprecedented publicity for British poetry: when Peter Sansom became Marks &amp; Spencer's poet-in-residence, the news went round the world. Sub-editors vied in atrocious, punning headlines: \"Shall I compare thee to a summer sale?\" wrote one, while the Star composed an entire verse: \"I wandered lonely through the crowd/At my local M&amp;S/When all at once I saw a bard/Among the pants and vests.\" The Wall Street Journal carried a story on the chip shop poets, Peter Street and Steven Waling, while the media in Canada, India, Japan and Korea reported on Anglo-Czech poet Andrew Fusek Peters being helicoptered to the gas platform off Great Yarmouth where he worked 12-hour shifts like the crew. And the scheme's millennium poet, Simon Armitage, got more admiring reviews for his 1,000-line new year poem, Killing Time, than the Dome itself, where he has been in residence. Indeed, he got rather more sympathetic reviews than the millennium poem by poet laureate Andrew Motion. </p> <p>Morag McRae has run the scheme with fellow poet Christina Patterson from an attic in Covent Garden, and calculates that at least 10,000 people have come into direct contact with a living, published poet, who has turned up in their doctor's waiting room, supermarket, or mobile library. Ian McMillan, who was already club mascot at Barnsley FC, became an online poet in Yorkshire, reading, writing and talking poetry in a specially designated poet's train carriage, and Roger McGough took up his post as internet poet-in-residence at BT before Christmas. </p> <p>Altogether, 124 poets have worked at 146 centres - including a prison and the crypt of Worcester cathedral - for periods lasting between a few days and six months.

      "bodyText": "The instant museum piece Last year Bernardine Evaristo was poet-in-residence at the Museum of London. This is an unpublished poem, Routes. Time has frozen this midwinter night. Outside the pavement coated with a transparent skin, I retreat into down, sensing the vibration of polar sheets creeping south, burying us a thousand feet under blue ice, diverting the river out of the Vale of St Albans into the London Basin. Welcome home. Welcome first citizen, chasing reindeer over the hip joint with France, tropical and glacier cycles, waves of migrators - your long trek north, from below the Sahara, circling a camp fire by the Thames the hair of wolves over tight backs; dread- locked beards, un-polished eyes, your slow, heavy mouths chewing fresh rhinoceros, roasted, no spices; unaware that you are dislocating from France as you eat, that the Channel is rising, that my heated body floats above a London of birch and pine forest, of open grassland where gangs of straight-tusked elephants gather in Trafalgar Square, hippopotami wallow in the brown marshes of Pall Mall and from Marble Arch I gaze longingly on sheets of marigold, meadowsweet, mint. Unless some wealthy philanthropist surfaces with a craving for couplets at checkouts and quatrains on bin bags, the most successful and popular campaign in the history of British poetry is about to come to a full stop. Over the past two years, Poetry Places, a scheme organised by the Poetry Society to get poets out of their ivory towers and into the workplace, has brought poems to the public in the most unlikely places: poems on greaseproof wrappers in Wigan chip shops, poems printed on refuse sacks in Norfolk, poems on spikes among the plants in a botanical garden, and poems on walls, bus shelters and beaches. The two-year programme, the brainchild of outgoing Poetry Society director Chris Meade, attracted the highest ever arts lottery grant for literature: \u00a3450,000. But now the time is up and the money is gone; the final grants have been allocated, and the last poets-in-residence are taking their places. They include: Benjamin Zephaniah, who will shadow Michael Mansfield QC through his court appearances, and, if the clients agree, through his private consultations; James Crowden, who will work at Wheal Jane tin mine in Cornwall; Christine Hemp, who will be in Lambeth, south London, trying to hold a poetic line between police officers and young people judged at risk of becoming offenders; and Antrim-born poet Brendan Cleary, who will take up a post in one of the oldest working cinemas in the country, the 1910 Duke of York's in Brighton, where they hope to put poems on screen between films. The project has generated unprecedented publicity for British poetry: when Peter Sansom became Marks &amp; Spencer's poet-in-residence, the news went round the world. Sub-editors vied in atrocious, punning headlines: \"Shall I compare thee to a summer sale?\" wrote one, while the Star composed an entire verse: \"I wandered lonely through the crowd/At my local M&amp;S/When all at once I saw a bard/Among the pants and vests.\" The Wall Street Journal carried a story on the chip shop poets, Peter Street and Steven Waling, while the media in Canada, India, Japan and Korea reported on Anglo-Czech poet Andrew Fusek Peters being helicoptered to the gas platform off Great Yarmouth where he worked 12-hour shifts like the crew. And the scheme's millennium poet, Simon Armitage, got more admiring reviews for his 1,000-line new year poem, Killing Time, than the Dome itself, where he has been in residence. Indeed, he got rather more sympathetic reviews than the millennium poem by poet laureate Andrew Motion. Morag McRae has run the scheme with fellow poet Christina Patterson from an attic in Covent Garden, and calculates that at least 10,000 people have come into direct contact with a living, published poet, who has turned up in their doctor's waiting room, supermarket, or mobile library. Ian McMillan, who was already club mascot at Barnsley FC, became an online poet in Yorkshire, reading, writing and talking poetry in a specially designated poet's train carriage, and Roger McGough took up his post as internet poet-in-residence at BT before Christmas. Altogether, 124 poets have worked at 146 centres - including a prison and the crypt of Worcester cathedral - for periods lasting between a few days and six months. In a north London tattoo parlour, poet Patience Aghabi and the tattooist gave one client an entire Shakespeare sonnet wrapped around his upper arm. \"It's been wonderful. The public reaction has been astonishing and terribly touching, and the poets themselves feel they have benefited enormously,\" says McRae. All the poets who took up the full residencies, from those with only the slenderest of published volumes to superstars such as McGough and Zephaniah, were paid the same: \u00a35,000 for six months, part-time.

At a time when technology is impinging on our lives in ever-faster ways, the artists here are using it to slow things down - \"allowing us to see things we couldn't see in any other way,\" says Eddie Berg, director of Fact (Foundation for Art and Creative Technology) and something of a pioneer in this field. </p> <p>He staged the first Video Positive exhibition in the late 80s, when much of the British art world saw electronic work as marginal and gimmicky; now the work of just about every Turner prizewinner involves video installation. \"It's become mainstream,\" says Berg. \"So a festival like this has to look at how we can approach video in a different way.\" Hence The Other Side of Zero, a suitable opportunity to pause and take a step back from the much-hyped cutting edge of technology. </p> <p>The nine works on show (on three different sites) have at least one thing in common - a stripped-down style in which flashy, virtuoso displays are noticeable by their absence. </p> <p>Goodwin's Wait shares a gallery with two pieces whose subjects are either static or moving extremely slowly. In AK Dolven's haunting Looking Back, three old women walk backwards across the same Norwegian landscape, projected on to three giant screens. They travel with such glacial slowness that you begin to wonder if they are risking hypothermia. It takes a while to realise that one of them has stopped mid-screen. She scans the surroundings she knows so well before backing gingerly towards the edge of the screen. First she becomes a shadow; then she disappears. The others are not far behind her. All that's left is the landscape: dramatic, indestructible, timeless. </p> <p>If Dolven's videos have a painterly quality, Monika Oeschler's work is distinctly cinematic. Here are seven female poker players, perched on stools in a garish club. A camera positioned in the centre of the table rotates slowly to pick up what action there is so that viewers feel as though they are on a gentle merry-go-round. </p> <p>Unlike the impassive men this viewer has played poker with, these women (all carefully choreographed actresses) allow some mobility to infiltrate their facial muscles. But are the dimpling smiles and dagger-like eyeballings from beneath fluttering lashes just a more feminine way of bluffing? If the eyes are the window of the soul, poker players keep the curtains drawn. </p> <p>Oeschler sets about prising the curtains apart, affording us chinks of light as the group dynamics unfold.

Cavities don't kill, but we've all been to the dentist and most of us hate it. </p> <p>Professor Jeffrey Hillman's new treatment won't put dentists out of a job, but it could leave them with a lot less to do. And the people who have most to lose are worried. \"Some dentists don't believe it will be successful. They see it as a threat,\" says Hillman. </p> <p>The university of Florida researcher has come up with a brilliantly simple way to tackle tooth decay. Using the genetic engineering techniques best known for creating GM food he has engineered a harmless version of the bacteria that rots our teeth. </p> <p>The villain of the piece is Streptococcus mutans, a naturally occurring bacteria that lives in our mouths. Streptococcus mutans is busy on your teeth right now, happily feeding itself on whatever sugar it can find. It provides us with some benefits - producing important vitamins and giving protection against nastier bacteria - but our teeth pay the price. In return for keeping it alive, the bacteria produces lactic acid which attacks tooth enamel and causes cavities. </p> <p>Hillman manipulated Streptococcus DNA to remove the gene responsible for producing lactic acid. The new bacteria - known as an effector strain - thrives on sugar but, unlike the original bacteria, does not produce lactic acid. If this strain were used to replaced the original strain on our teeth the majority of cavities could be prevented. </p> <p>The new strain was tested first on rats who, like humans, suffer the effects of the Streptococcus mutans. No only did the effector strain colonise the rat's teeth, it actually dominated the original strain. Ironically, feeding the rats with a high-sugar diet helped the new strain replace the old one and hence reduced the amount of lactic acid. The long-term prospects are also good - the new strain appears to be stable and to stay permanently on teeth. </p> <p>Clinical trials start this year and Hillman is confident that they will confirm the safety and effectiveness of the new strain. But convincing the authorities to license his treatment may not be his biggest challenge. After a slow start, opposition to GM technologies is taking off in the US. The idea of gargling with a genetically modified bacteria is unlikely to appeal, regardless of what clinical trials prove. </p> <p>Hillman is confident the public will see the benefits. \"This approach is really a lot more natural than most of the antibacterial approaches in use today. Over the next 100,000 or so years, natural selection would act on Streptococcus mutans to reduce its virulence and on humans to increase their resistance to Streptococcus mutans. This therapy is an attempt to speed up this process by doing in the lab in 20 years what it would take nature 100,000 years.\" </p> <p>If Hillman's idea does pass the clinical trials and a sceptical public can be persuaded, the treatment could be in use in two to three years. \"The ideal application would be to treat infants when their first teeth appear. They normally acquire Streptococcus mutans via contaminated saliva from their mother,\" says Hillman. \"The child would simply visit their dentist for a squirt of solution on their teeth.\" </p> <p>Since the new strain dominates over the old this initial treatment should last for a lifetime. And the work with rats suggests that adults - who already have Streptococcus mutans on their teeth - will be protected by the same simple process. </p> <p>Streptococcus isn't the only bacteria that causes decay, but it is reckoned to be responsible for the majority of cavities. And even if it doesn't eliminate tooth decay, it might leave dentists with a little more time on their hands.</p>",

But convincing the authorities to license his treatment may not be his biggest challenge. After a slow start, opposition to GM technologies is taking off in the US. The idea of gargling with a genetically modified bacteria is unlikely to appeal, regardless of what clinical trials prove. Hillman is confident the public will see the benefits. \"This approach is really a lot more natural than most of the antibacterial approaches in use today. Over the next 100,000 or so years, natural selection would act on Streptococcus mutans to reduce its virulence and on humans to increase their resistance to Streptococcus mutans. This therapy is an attempt to speed up this process by doing in the lab in 20 years what it would take nature 100,000 years.\" If Hillman's idea does pass the clinical trials and a sceptical public can be persuaded, the treatment could be in use in two to three years. \"The ideal application would be to treat infants when their first teeth appear. They normally acquire Streptococcus mutans via contaminated saliva from their mother,\" says Hillman. \"The child would simply visit their dentist for a squirt of solution on their teeth.\" Since the new strain dominates over the old this initial treatment should last for a lifetime. And the work with rats suggests that adults - who already have Streptococcus mutans on their teeth - will be protected by the same simple process. Streptococcus isn't the only bacteria that causes decay, but it is reckoned to be responsible for the majority of cavities. And even if it doesn't eliminate tooth decay, it might leave dentists with a little more time on their hands.",

When members of the group Concerned Christians were arrested in Israel two years ago - suspected of plotting violent acts to \"hasten\" the coming of the Messiah - one Israeli millennial specialist was shocked that the group did not have a website. \"How can any self-respecting millennialist group not be on the web?\" he exclaimed. </p> <p>The most shocking example of this type of web use was the mass suicide of the Heaven's Gate community (39 well-educated individuals) three years ago. They believed they were transporting themselves to a space craft tailing the Hale-Bopp comet. Dwelling communally in a small mansion in Rancho Santa Fe, California, the group supported itself designing web sites. When Hale-Bopp appeared, the Heaven's Gate community took it as a sign that their class was ready to \"graduate\". On their home page the words \"Red Alert\" flashed. The page said that Hale-Bopp was the marker for which they had been waiting. After their suicide on March 25 1997, visitors to the Heaven's Gate site found an epitaph written by one of the community, a poignant plea to the world to understand what they had done. </p> <p> Many of the Christian evangelical/ charismatic movements use the web to attract newcomers.

His tongue savours words in English, Tok Pisin and the local language, Kepai. He loves it, you can tell. He is practising for his future.</p> <p>His grandfather, the revered village chief and part-time pastor, watches him carefully, his glances showing pride. The 19-year-old has been brought up by his paternal grandparents. His grandmother harvests two younger granddaughters in her arms, their eyes wide at Danny's homecoming. They reach out to touch his shoes. Grandmother purrs: her husband, her grandson, the visitor and the young men, all in her home. A new vegetable garden, new crops, a truck to get them to market.</p> <p>But as she holds the girls tight, perhaps she senses that Danny is moving on from them; that he won't come home and settle down when he leaves school. His eyes and gestures are full of the future, rooted in the village but encompassing a wider world.</p> <p>Deep in the central highlands of Papua New Guinea, the village is a grower's dream. Pockets of rich, deep soil abound in these mountains and valleys. With the permanent spring weather, carrots, cauliflowers and cabbages grow alongside bananas, pineapples and sweet potatoes. Drop a seed, turn your back and pick the crop. A great place for subsistence-level organic food-growing, which is why the highlands has sustained a large population for centuries.</p> <p>But it is also a nightmare if you want to transport your produce. The outside world did not know these communities existed until the 1930s, because the rugged terrain prevents easy access except by aircraft. But Danny knows of the growing towns on the coastal plains, has studied drought problems, read of his country's huge food imports. It seems easier and cheaper to ship in rice to these areas than to organise and transport home-grown but perishable food from the thousands of isolated village valley gardens in the highlands. Danny is determined to find a way; his education has convinced him that his product is healthy, plentiful and sustainable.</p> <p>His grandparents know that setting up the garden, growing new crops and maintaining the soil fertility are matters that Danny will soon pass on to his friends in the village. The real struggle will be the rest of the job: moving the crops and marketing them. Since Danny was born his mother has spent most of her life working in towns on the coast. He sees her occasionally. She has given him the belief that he can bridge the gap, but there is no money to set up the venture. Fees have had to be raised for the 12 years he has been in school.</p> <p>Danny jumps up, sweeps aside a cloth curtain that conceals his corner of the small house, and fetches paper and a pen. It is the universal student bedroom: papers, books, a radio, pens and rulers, all set out on the earth floor. Not a stick of furniture, no anglepoise lamp, but the essentials are there. He sits by his grandfather's feet, and sketches out the garden: drain lines, nursery area, compost heaps, erosion barriers and water channels. Grandfather asks about pests. Danny turns to the visitor; they talk of mixed cropping, rotations and healthy seeds. Grandmother asks about beetroot; she once heard that it is good for the blood.</p> <p>Finally a juicy ripe pineapple is sliced, and six fresh sticks of sugar cane arrive. Danny says grace. The air is full of sweetness. Departing handshakes are sticky affairs.</p> <p>Through the village, past the round huts,the latrine and the haus man . This place, once the preserve of the men, is now a warm, smoky, thatched pub of a place for all the family after church. Dogs, cats, pigs and babies mingle among the legs. Danny moves between the groups of people, hugging, smiling, clasping hands. The first boy from the village to go so far in education.</p> <p>Danny is ecstatic. The visit home has been part of his dream; he had a sleepless night worrying about it. He sleeps soundly on the trip back to school, the battered bus jolting between sealed and broken roads. The late afternoon rain pours down during the last hour's walk down to the school. He has missed supper, and bed beckons. Danny looks tired but happy. Double advanced mathematics first thing in the morning.</p>",

But Danny knows of the growing towns on the coastal plains, has studied drought problems, read of his country's huge food imports. It seems easier and cheaper to ship in rice to these areas than to organise and transport home-grown but perishable food from the thousands of isolated village valley gardens in the highlands. Danny is determined to find a way; his education has convinced him that his product is healthy, plentiful and sustainable. His grandparents know that setting up the garden, growing new crops and maintaining the soil fertility are matters that Danny will soon pass on to his friends in the village. The real struggle will be the rest of the job: moving the crops and marketing them. Since Danny was born his mother has spent most of her life working in towns on the coast. He sees her occasionally. She has given him the belief that he can bridge the gap, but there is no money to set up the venture. Fees have had to be raised for the 12 years he has been in school. Danny jumps up, sweeps aside a cloth curtain that conceals his corner of the small house, and fetches paper and a pen. It is the universal student bedroom: papers, books, a radio, pens and rulers, all set out on the earth floor. Not a stick of furniture, no anglepoise lamp, but the essentials are there. He sits by his grandfather's feet, and sketches out the garden: drain lines, nursery area, compost heaps, erosion barriers and water channels. Grandfather asks about pests. Danny turns to the visitor; they talk of mixed cropping, rotations and healthy seeds. Grandmother asks about beetroot; she once heard that it is good for the blood. Finally a juicy ripe pineapple is sliced, and six fresh sticks of sugar cane arrive. Danny says grace. The air is full of sweetness. Departing handshakes are sticky affairs. Through the village, past the round huts,the latrine and the haus man . This place, once the preserve of the men, is now a warm, smoky, thatched pub of a place for all the family after church. Dogs, cats, pigs and babies mingle among the legs. Danny moves between the groups of people, hugging, smiling, clasping hands. The first boy from the village to go so far in education. Danny is ecstatic. The visit home has been part of his dream; he had a sleepless night worrying about it. He sleeps soundly on the trip back to school, the battered bus jolting between sealed and broken roads. The late afternoon rain pours down during the last hour's walk down to the school. He has missed supper, and bed beckons. Danny looks tired but happy. Double advanced mathematics first thing in the morning.",

      "bodyText": "British Telecom yesterday announced government-backed plans to create up to 50 regional centres to attract a wave of \"new economy\" companies to the UK and promote the country's role as the European hub for e-commerce. The \u00a370m initiative from BT Elocations - a new division of the group - is designed to help foster the growth of \"clusters\" of hi-tech, internet-based companies throughout the UK, and not just in the golden south east. Sir Peter Bonfield, BT's chief executive, said Britain needed to adjust swiftly to the new economy to retain its position as Europe's premier location for inward investment, attracting 23% of the EU total. The initiative, backed by the Invest in Britain Bureau, the IBB, aims to establish one-stop advice shops for would-be overseas investors in business and technology parks in the UK's 15 regions, including Northern Ireland. Patricia Hewitt, the e-commerce minister, said it should exploit Britain's leading role in wireless telephony and digital television by providing newcommers with \"a physical place and a virtual network.\" Andrew Fraser, the chief executive of the IBB, said the UK must be ready to accept the next era of investment after the establishment of a network of call centres. The aim is to staff the new centres with multi-skilled staff - including people speaking a range of languages.",

      "bodyText": "The Bank of England signalled yesterday that it would be re-examining the chancellor's Budget in case it puts upward pressure on inflation and interest rates. The monetary policy committee was aware of the broad outline of Mr Brown's projections for growth and the public finances when it met earlier this month and left borrowing costs on hold at 6%. The Bank of England's rate-setting committee concluded that \"the impact on future activity and inflation seemed to be failrly small\". However, minutes of its meeting published yesterday showed that the MPC thought \"more analysis would be needed once full details of the Budget were known\". Despite the tax cuts and spending increases announced on Tuesday, the Treasury insists that fiscal policy remains tighter than envisaged at the time of last year's Budget and should have no adverse impact on interest rates. But City analysts pointed out that policy was now considerably looser than if Mr Brown had not cut taxes and increased spending. \"Ahead of the Budget, the chancellor faced the usual calls to tighten fiscal policy further to reduce upward pressure on interest rates and to help stem the strength of sterling,\" said David Walton, of Goldman Sachs, the American investment bank. \"While we expected the chancellor to reject these calls, he did it in a much more emphatic manner than we anticipated,\" he said.

Consumer spending remained strong, earnings growth was rising and the oil price was up, the MPC's minutes noted. However, the decision was finely balanced and there was time to wait for more data which were at present clouded in millennium \"fog\". There was also a danger that more expensive borrowing costs would boost sterling on the foreign exchanges, and there was uncertainty about the impact of the Budget. The minutes record: \"It was not possible to do a full analysis of the Budget yet so it might be prudent to wait before a firm conclusion on the implications for inflation.\" Other MPC members saw no need for an increase in rates this month. They noted that although domestic demand was stronger and trade weaker than in February, there was no clear implication for inflation as these factors were offset by others in the economy. They also thought that the Budget suggested a tighter fiscal stance than previously anticipated by companies and individuals - and that there were risks of a sharp reversal of the oil prices and an American stock market crash which would exert downward pressure on inflation. \"Given that interest rates had increased 100 basis points in four steps over the past six months, it was sensible to wait and see how the economy reacted, particularly given the short-term inflation profile,\" the minutes noted.",

One fifth of these belong to the country's poorest families, but there is a further one sixteenth who earn average incomes and have chosen, out of the hatred that only financial institutions can inspire, to opt out of investing in them. </p> <p>The advantages are largely cardiovascular.

He has since gone bankrupt, suffered a heart attack and, in lieu of keeping a bank account, has chosen to set up a series of jam jars into which he deposits \u00a310 notes on a weekly basis. </p> <p>\"It took some adjusting to,\" he says. \"But you get used to it. I do occasional television appearances to advise on financial exploitation and am paid in cash. You pay your bills in cash at the post office and although they sometimes charge you an extra fiver, it's better than entrusting your money to the banks.\" </p> <p>In 1993, Brian Jones lost his business owing to what he believes to have been bank errors. He not only withdrew from all forms of organised finance, but launched a campaign against Barclays that has elevated him, in some circles, to the status of a superhero: Credit Avenger. </p> <p>\"I tried asking them respectfully to sort out my problems,\" he says from his home in Bristol. \"I wrote 360 letters. I kept saying to myself, 'What am I doing wrong?' I was brought up to respect my peers and I couldn't believe if you rang up with a problem, they wouldn't deal with it.\" </p> <p>Jones dealt with the impasse by setting up an organisation called Safe, Security Against Financial Exploitation, and attracting formerly affluent, disgruntled bank customers to the cause. He dressed up as the Grim Reaper and marched into Barclays head office, rigged an 18ft billboard bearing the legend \"Tell me where I can find the chairman of this bank\" to the roof of his car, christened it the Grief Wagon, and drove it around London. He threatened to drop in on the chairman of the bank during his Christmas dinner and, wherever he went, he left stickers reading: \"I am Brian Jones, I'll be back.\" </p> <p>Jones is at the extreme end of the anti-banking fraternity. A more measured withdrawal is to join an organisation like Lets, the Local Exchange Trading Scheme that has 450 branches and 40,000 members across the country. To some, Lets represents the weirdy-beardy, communitarianism end of non-banking. It advertises itself with the motto \"Enjoy wealth without money\", which sounds like a prelude to some kind of religious recruitment drive, but is an entirely literal compression of its bartering and exchange system. </p> <p>\"Our members come from all different kinds of background,\" says David Robertson, the administrator of Lets Scotland. Members don't have to hate the banks to join the group - many of them, including Robertson, maintain current accounts on the side, while trying to confine their financial dealings to local trading circles - ie exchanging ironing or lawn-mowing duties for cake baking and babysitting. \"A member may not have a current account, but they will have a Lets account to the value of \u00a3200 and that is good enough for us,\" says Robertson. </p> <p>That \u00a3200 worth of credit is referred to as \"local currency\" and can be exchanged at bazaars and Lets trade outlets for food, furniture or services that might otherwise require officially recognised credit. And they have fun with it too. For example, Robertson has a row of plants for sale on his window sill, which, to keep fellow members amused, he has marked up in \"groats\". </p> <p>\"The thing that makes the system sustainable is that it has a cross section of society within it. There are those who offer to do ironing and gardening, as well as those who can fill in a tax form. It shows that you can get by without a bank account.\" </p> <p>This is not financial necessity, but a way of life entertained by people who believe that strengthening the local community means giving its members a wider set of economic choices than are offered by profit-making banks and building societies. </p> <p>It is aided by credit unions, low-income investment houses that lend money at low interest rates and encourage customers to transfer a minimum of \u00a310 a month from their envelope system to an account. </p> <p>\"You are cutting off your nose in spite of your face by boycotting the banking systems,\" says Neil Walkling, principal money researcher at the Consumers Association. \"So many transactions rely on automated credit that to be out of the loop is a severe disadvantage. Customers hostile to the main high street banks might look beyond them to smaller, Scottish banks or places like the Halifax.\" </p> <p>For those who don't, the problems encountered are cruel and obvious. Lena Stewart has to pay all her bills by postal order, which costs her an added fee for each cash conversion. \"When I try to cash a cheque in a shop they charge as much as \u00a35 to do it,\" she says. \"If the gas board overcharges me, they'll say they don't do cash refunds so that it always takes a lot of to-ing and fro-ing before I get my money.\" </p> <p>Keith Whincup thinks of these problems as a small price to pay for the larger benefit of screwing the banks. The only account he would consider opening is with a foreign institution like American Express, which, after years of research, he believes to be less mercenary than the British banks. Meanwhile, he is happy to rely on the superior banking services of his jam jars.</p>",

A more measured withdrawal is to join an organisation like Lets, the Local Exchange Trading Scheme that has 450 branches and 40,000 members across the country. To some, Lets represents the weirdy-beardy, communitarianism end of non-banking. It advertises itself with the motto \"Enjoy wealth without money\", which sounds like a prelude to some kind of religious recruitment drive, but is an entirely literal compression of its bartering and exchange system. \"Our members come from all different kinds of background,\" says David Robertson, the administrator of Lets Scotland. Members don't have to hate the banks to join the group - many of them, including Robertson, maintain current accounts on the side, while trying to confine their financial dealings to local trading circles - ie exchanging ironing or lawn-mowing duties for cake baking and babysitting. \"A member may not have a current account, but they will have a Lets account to the value of \u00a3200 and that is good enough for us,\" says Robertson. That \u00a3200 worth of credit is referred to as \"local currency\" and can be exchanged at bazaars and Lets trade outlets for food, furniture or services that might otherwise require officially recognised credit. And they have fun with it too. For example, Robertson has a row of plants for sale on his window sill, which, to keep fellow members amused, he has marked up in \"groats\". \"The thing that makes the system sustainable is that it has a cross section of society within it. There are those who offer to do ironing and gardening, as well as those who can fill in a tax form. It shows that you can get by without a bank account.\" This is not financial necessity, but a way of life entertained by people who believe that strengthening the local community means giving its members a wider set of economic choices than are offered by profit-making banks and building societies. It is aided by credit unions, low-income investment houses that lend money at low interest rates and encourage customers to transfer a minimum of \u00a310 a month from their envelope system to an account. \"You are cutting off your nose in spite of your face by boycotting the banking systems,\" says Neil Walkling, principal money researcher at the Consumers Association. \"So many transactions rely on automated credit that to be out of the loop is a severe disadvantage. Customers hostile to the main high street banks might look beyond them to smaller, Scottish banks or places like the Halifax.\" For those who don't, the problems encountered are cruel and obvious. Lena Stewart has to pay all her bills by postal order, which costs her an added fee for each cash conversion. \"When I try to cash a cheque in a shop they charge as much as \u00a35 to do it,\" she says. \"If the gas board overcharges me, they'll say they don't do cash refunds so that it always takes a lot of to-ing and fro-ing before I get my money.\" Keith Whincup thinks of these problems as a small price to pay for the larger benefit of screwing the banks. The only account he would consider opening is with a foreign institution like American Express, which, after years of research, he believes to be less mercenary than the British banks. Meanwhile, he is happy to rely on the superior banking services of his jam jars.",

The first movement, Terror of the Hunted, opened with gestures of violence and volatility, with Hosford's screaming clarinet line grating against Simon Limbrick's menacing cowbells and drums. </p> <p>Despite the movement's apparently frenzied increase in activity, with clarinet and piccolo enhanced by trumpet and trombone wails, the music remained curiously static. The texture was dominated by insistent, irregular percussion rhythms, which seemed to grind the momentum of the surrounding parts to a standstill. Causton's depiction of \"terror\" was broad-brush and strangely undynamic - like a freeze-frame photograph of a hunt rather than an animate, vital battle sequence. </p> <p>The Blooding of the second movement provided a complete contrast, with mellifluous vibraphone replacing the opening movement's staccato. Within The Blooding's soft-hued harmonic palette and sense of detachment, John Wallace's concluding flugelhorn solo provided the richest commentary on the preceding pursuit. Like a dissonantly transformed hunting horn, Wallace's instrument no longer sounded the call to the kill, but lamented the victims of the chase. </p> <p>Mezzo-soprano Jean Rigby was reunited with Brabbins and the ensemble in James Macmillan's song cycle Raising Sparks, as this team gave its first performance in 1997. The work sets texts by Michael Symmons Roberts, with whom Macmillan collaborated on his Proms commission, Quickening, last year.

Macmillan's operatic vocal writing and transparent instrumental imagery create a music that cannot escape the centrifugal symbolism of the poetry.

You go up to get away from everything and find yourself surrounded by people.

The threads of its different stories, of past and present, documentary and fiction, and its variety of styles never quite come together. It feels like a series of moments, not a seamless whole. Like its characters, it is often too self-conscious. But it's insightful too, at times capturing the beauty and brutality of the mountains and those who climb them, and the hallucinatory madness of risking all and heading into thin air. </p> <p> Until April 8.
