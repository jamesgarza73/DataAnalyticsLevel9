The move by the watchdog has been prompted by the merger talks between Halifax and Bank of Scotland, which were said to be close to completion last night. Speculation that they were almost ready to reveal details of the deal mounted after BoS took the unusual step of calling off the presentation of its annual results scheduled for today. A combined Halifax/BoS is regarded as having the potential to create a \"fifth force\" on the high street to compete with Lloyds TSB, Barclays, HSBC and Royal Bank of Scotland/NatWest. That merger plan has surfaced since the competition commission began its investigation into the competition implications of Lloyds TSB's hostile bid for Abbey National. Denise Kingsmill, the competition commission deputy chairman, said last night she was writing to Abbey National and Lloyds TSB. \"We are inviting both parties to make rep resentations on how we should regard this new proposed merger.\" She has already suggested to the two banks remedies for any findings of anti-competitive behaviour. Her shortlist includes selling branches and disposing of subsidiaries, but did not rule out unconditional rejection of a merger. Much of her investigation, which began after the Lloyds bid was referred by the Department of Trade and Industry, focuses on the provision of current accounts, in which the \"big four\" have a combined share of over 70%. \"We are still a long way from having formed a view [on the competition implications of the Lloyds/Abbey deal]. A fifth force is one thing, real competition in current accounts is another,\" Mrs Kingsmill said. She has until mid-June to report to the DTI. The City has speculated that a BoS/Halifax merger will make it more likely that the Lloyds bid is cleared. Peter Ellwood, chief executive of Lloyds TSB, has said that the attempted merger between Halifax and BoS changed the \"competitive dynamics\" in the financial markets. \"It will create a major com petitor and therefore the idea of Abbey being a 'fifth force' doesn't have quite the relevance that it was mooted to have had,\" Mr Ellwood said. Abbey refused to comment last night but has resisted the takeover attempt by Lloyds TSB, which scuppered its own attempts to merge with BoS. The negotiations between Halifax and BoS gained pace after reports of the negotiations leaked. Both parties were last night trying to secure agreement on the composition of the combined bank's board and its headquarters. Both sides are thought to be working towards sealing the terms of the deal before the coming holiday weekend. But many issues are still to be settled. Among these are the precise number of job losses, perhaps in the region of 2,000 from a 57,000-strong workforce, and the amount of revenue the new group would make. Both sides are expected to insist the deal is not about cutting costs and that job losses will be kept to minimum and split evenly between Halifax and Edinburgh. At Halifax's annual meeting, held in Edinburgh, shareholders urged the management not to \"cave in to tartan tantrums\".",

The site adds that police are starting to release people one by one from the Holles Street containment area, after searching and photographing them. A total of 35 people have now been arrested.</p> <p><b>6.50pm</b><br>A police announcement urges the core of around 1,000 protesters hemmed in at Oxford Circus to move towards the centre of the area and tells them that if they remain calm, arrangements will be made for them to leave as soon as possible. </p> <p><b>6.38pm</b><br>Two protesters who climbed on to a balcony of the John Lewis building in Holles Street, Oxford Circus, rip two CCTV cameras from their mounts and pass them down to the crowd. They also strip metal segments and pass them into the crowd where people appear to be trying to smash John Lewis windows. Meanwhile police mount a charge on Oxford Street as they come under a hail of bottles from protesters attempting to join other campaigners in Oxford Circus. </p> <p><b>6.15pm</b><br>According to reports from IndyMedia, the demonstrations appear to be petering out, with most protesters leaving the Oxford Circus area. Around 1,000 protesters have moved on to Mayfair where a good-natured carnival atmosphere is prevailing, the site reports. </p> <p><b>6.05pm</b><br>More trouble breaks out at Oxford Circus as police move in to arrest a protester, and are forced back by a volley of missiles outside the boarded up windows of Niketown. They are forced back to join their colleagues sealing off Oxford Circus at the junction with the eastern part of Oxford Street. There is no indication when the 1,000 people crammed into the sealed-off Oxford Circus area will be released.</p> <p><b>5.50pm</b><br>31 people have now been arrested. The London ambulance service said that 15 people have sustained minor injuries, with 10 taken to hospital.</p> <p><b>5.40pm</b><br>Officers, some on horseback and some wielding batons and shields, exchange blows with demonstrators at several points around Oxford Circus.</p> <p>Riot police clash violently with protesters in the flashpoint area of Holles Street near Oxford Circus. Several protesters emerge from the melee with bloodied heads. One protester had to have his head bandaged and said: \"I got kicked in between the legs and then hit over the head with a truncheon.\"</p> <p><b>5.30pm</b><br>Police say all the 29 arrests are for \"relatively minor\" offences. Protesters trying to break out of Holles Street on to Oxford Street fight a battle with dozens of police, and officers use batons to keep back protesters taunting them with chants of \"scum, scum\". </p> <p><b>5.20pm</b><br>Two of those arrested so far were detained for causing alleged criminal damage in a Sainsbury's store in Victoria Street, central London.

      "bodyText": "7.30pm: standoff in Oxford Circus Police and protesters are left in an uneasy standoff in Oxford Circus, with the rump of cold and wet demonstrators remaining penned in by riot police and awaiting permission to leave the area. Headlines from UK latest 7.20pm IndyMedia reports that police containment is contributing to a crush at the centre of the crowd in Oxford Circus. The site adds that police are starting to release people one by one from the Holles Street containment area, after searching and photographing them. A total of 35 people have now been arrested. 6.50pm A police announcement urges the core of around 1,000 protesters hemmed in at Oxford Circus to move towards the centre of the area and tells them that if they remain calm, arrangements will be made for them to leave as soon as possible. 6.38pm Two protesters who climbed on to a balcony of the John Lewis building in Holles Street, Oxford Circus, rip two CCTV cameras from their mounts and pass them down to the crowd. They also strip metal segments and pass them into the crowd where people appear to be trying to smash John Lewis windows. Meanwhile police mount a charge on Oxford Street as they come under a hail of bottles from protesters attempting to join other campaigners in Oxford Circus. 6.15pm According to reports from IndyMedia, the demonstrations appear to be petering out, with most protesters leaving the Oxford Circus area. Around 1,000 protesters have moved on to Mayfair where a good-natured carnival atmosphere is prevailing, the site reports. 6.05pm More trouble breaks out at Oxford Circus as police move in to arrest a protester, and are forced back by a volley of missiles outside the boarded up windows of Niketown. They are forced back to join their colleagues sealing off Oxford Circus at the junction with the eastern part of Oxford Street. There is no indication when the 1,000 people crammed into the sealed-off Oxford Circus area will be released. 5.50pm 31 people have now been arrested. The London ambulance service said that 15 people have sustained minor injuries, with 10 taken to hospital. 5.40pm Officers, some on horseback and some wielding batons and shields, exchange blows with demonstrators at several points around Oxford Circus. Riot police clash violently with protesters in the flashpoint area of Holles Street near Oxford Circus. Several protesters emerge from the melee with bloodied heads. One protester had to have his head bandaged and said: \"I got kicked in between the legs and then hit over the head with a truncheon.\" 5.30pm Police say all the 29 arrests are for \"relatively minor\" offences. Protesters trying to break out of Holles Street on to Oxford Street fight a battle with dozens of police, and officers use batons to keep back protesters taunting them with chants of \"scum, scum\". 5.20pm Two of those arrested so far were detained for causing alleged criminal damage in a Sainsbury's store in Victoria Street, central London. IndyMedia reports that the police have requested the closure of Bond Street tube. 5.15pm Protesters have broken through police lines at Holles Street, just off Oxford Street. Police charged protesters with shields and hit some with batons. 5.05pm IndyMedia reports that windows have been smashed at the H&amp;M store in Oxford Circus. A group of around 500 protesters are making their way west down Oxford Street to Marble Arch, police said. 5.05pm A group of around 40 white-overall clad Wombles make an appearance at the protests and lead a group of hundreds of protesters to Portland Place, north of Regent Street, Guardian Unlimited reporter Simon Jeffery reports. 5pm Police have closed Waterloo, Lambeth, Vauxhall and Hungerford bridges to pedestrians, Scotland Yard said. Police on Regent Street launch another baton charge in new clashes with demonstrators after some of the crowd moves north to Cavendish Square, then storm through the line of police in Holles Street. 4.30pm London ambulance service said seven people are being treated for minor injuries in the Oxford Circus area. There have been a total of 29 arrests, Scotland Yard reports. 4.15pm Police make the following announcement to protesters at Oxford Circus: \"You are being detained here to prevent a breach of the peace and criminal damage to property. You will be released in due course.\" 4pm Scotland Yard says 22 people have been arrested and one person has been wounded. Police in riot gear and protesters remain in a tense standoff at Oxford Circus. 3.48pm IndyMedia reports that police have begun using batons. 3.25pm IndyMedia reports that police are sending snatch squads into the crowd on the north-west corner of the crossroads at Regent Street. Scotland Yard says the number of arrests now stands at 18. 3.21pm The police containment zone has been expanded to half way down Regent Street, IndyMedia reports. One demonstrator is carried away with his face covered in blood. Officers in riot gear replace officers in regular uniform policing the demonstration. 3.12pm Police come under a hail of wine bottles, beer bottles and sticks as protesters attempt to surge forward into Regent Street. The demonstrators advance momentarily before being pushed back towards Oxford Circus. Scuffles break out among the crowds. 3.06pm Police have estimated the number of demonstrators gathered at Oxford Circus at about 3,000. 3.02pm Some reports said \"up to 10,000\" have gathered in Oxford Circus and are now penned in by police vans and officers.

      "body": "<p>A week of travel woes.</p> <p> While in Malawi, I had taken the decision to continue with my circuit of southern Africa rather than trying to fit in Tanzania and Kenya as well. The main reason for this was that I really wanted to explore Namibia properly. It sounds so completely different from anywhere else I've been: the enormous Namib desert with its towering sand dunes; Etosha National Park with its amazing wildlife and salt pans; the lonely Skeleton Coast and the spectacular gorge of the Fish River Canyon. With all this in mind, I had booked myself a three-week trip with a South African-based company called CampWild, which would take me from Victoria Falls through Botswana, Namibia and down to Cape Town.</p> <p> After our visit to Zambia, H and I spent a couple of days relaxing in Lilongwe before we had to go our separate ways again. Obviously neither of us were particularly happy about this and the mood was pretty miserable in the taxi out to the airport. Things didn't improve when I arrived to discover that my flight to Zimbabwe had been cancelled - and there would be no more until October. I saw H off on her London flight and then went back to have an argument with someone, anyone.</p> <p> This was the Easter weekend and therefore not exactly the best time to try to make new travel arrangements. The Air Zimbabawe official was on holiday, and a phone call to Harare proved fruitless. The Air Malawi official was more helpful, and she told me to come back early the next morning and she would see what she could do.</p> <p> I was beginning to get worried. My tour was due to leave in three days and I still needed to get from Harare to Victoria Falls. Back at the hostel in Lilongwe (a nice overland truck place called Kiboko Camp) I spent the afternoon playing bauo with the barman and trying to drown my sorrows.</p> <p> The next morning I was at the airport before they'd even had a chance to open the doors. The Air Malawi lady had good and bad news. I could catch a plane to Blantyre where there was an onward flight to Harare that day. Unfortunately, it was fully booked so I would have to wait and see if someone cancelled. The alternative was a crazy detour via Johannesburg which would mean spending the whole day on planes.</p> <p> So I flew to Blantyre and had a nervous couple of hours watching the Harare flight fill up. Then ten minutes before take-off, an official came over and told me someone hadn't arrived and I was allowed on the plane. Hooray. That afternoon I took a walk round Harare which, although quiet, seemed a pleasant, compact city.</p> <p> A day later I arrived in Victoria Falls and got to check my email for the first time in four weeks. There sitting on the screen was a message telling me that my Cape Town tour had been cancelled due to lack of numbers. All that hassle for nothing.</p> <p> I spent a little while feeling sorry for myself and then went out to come up with a plan. First of all I had a look in all the hostels hoping to find someone driving down to Nambia, but everywhere was quiet. Then I went to a very helpful travel agent in town called the Backpackers Bazaar. The people who ran the hostel I was staying in (357 Gibson Road - I recommend it) also had some good advice. By the end of the day I had lots of scribbled notes and sat down to look at my guidebook and work out the options.</p> <p> Basically, I could do everything I would have done on the tour by using local buses and different companies, but it was going to cost more and take a lot longer. Five months ago I wouldn't have thought twice about this, but now, with only six week left, my budget was beginning to pinch. And it wasn't just the money. For the first time, the end of my trip is beginning to loom on the horizon and I'm not at all sure how I feel about that. On the one hand it will be good to see my friends and family again. On the other, home means coming back down to earth and having to sort out a job and a place to live - none of which I have given a thought to since I arrived in Africa.</p> <p> But it's not all over yet. So back to my current problem. The constraints of time and money meant that something had to give, and unfortunately it had to be my visit to the Okovango Delta in Botswana. This was desperately disappointing - it's supposed to be one of the best parks in Africa - but it's just too expensive. I'll have to save it for another, wealthier time.</p> <p> Determined not to miss out on anything else, I took a day-trip to Chobe National Park across the border in Botswana. This involved a boat trip down the flooded Chobe River (only a tributary of the Zambezi, but still huge for all that) followed by a game drive. The day was okay and we saw plenty of lions and elephants, but there were an awful lot of tourists about. As soon as one boat or truck found an animal then all the others would flock round. I hate to think what it would have been like in high season.</p> <p> Tomorrow, I get on a bus that will take me down to Windhoek to begin my exploration of Namibia, but before I go I should respond to a couple of your emails.</p> <p> Julie asked about getting round South Africa without a car. From what I saw you shouldn't have too many problems. There's a pretty good bus network between the major places, plus there's a backpackers' option called the BazBus which I've had recommended to me again and again. They have a number of useful routes and will even pick you up at your hostel.</p> <p> And Mike's message about my flying to Malawi has to be the most annoying one I've received. I agree, I could have made it by bus. But anyone who's travelled in Africa knows that the buses are notoriously unpredictable. The point (which Mike seems to have missed) is that I needed to be in a certain place at a certain time to meet my girlfriend, who was flying out from London. As I hadn't seen her for four months, I thought it might be rather rude to turn up late. And I'm pleased to say that the one-hour flight was considerably more comfortable than 19 hours on the bus would have been.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Last week, Cathy Kelly became the Romantic Novelist of the Year, winning \u00a35,000 and very little respect from the critics. This is par for the course in the world of romantic fiction: you earn a lot and die unnoticed. \"Romantic\" novels are the mainstay of publishers' fiction lists: know them in their pure form by their thickness (Kelly's Someone Like You is 677 pages long), the blue and gold or violet and silver jackets, and the fetching girl on the cover; see them everywhere, on newsagents' shelves and in the supermarket - buy them, discounted, along with your lottery ticket, that other hope of future bliss. The market is huge and growing - 182m books sold worldwide back in 1996, and add to that the recent chic-lit phenomena, the Bridget Jones lookalikes, and a massive influx of new young female devotees to the genre.</p> <p>All the genre novels have a hard time in literary circles - science fiction gets a bad press, crime thrillers (unless they're John le Carr\u00e9) are shrugged off - but special abuse is reserved for the romantic novel. I suspect we struggle against ourselves. It's the junk food of the literary appetite - fills you up but fails to nourish. Dangerous.</p> <p>Personally I read Someone Like You into the early hours and enjoyed it very much, though skipping the office detail, like pushing the gherkin to the edge of the plate, preferring to focus on the loss and longing bits, not to mention the clothes. I'm so glad Hannah got David in the end: I really am. Felix was bound to be trouble. Of course women can live happy and fulfilled lives without men - and perhaps they should try to, and certainly often have to. It's just, well, you know. You can dream, can't you?</p> <p>And it's not as if falling in love isn't real: we've all been there, done that. So OK, it was a rush of endorphins to the brain, a flood of hormones, a flurry of neurotic dependency because of what your father did - but it felt like romance at the time, if only for a moment. And the more they try to train you out of it, the more late-night hooker programmes they thrust at you on TV - so that's all sex is, yuk! - the more insanely you'll cling to those moments when you felt most alive and knew what you were on this earth for. Love. And you'll reach for the blue and gold, the violet and silver.</p> <p>\"A novel that deals with sexual love in idealised form\" is the formal definition of the romantic novel, but the pattern has changed, as have women's lives, and their practical dependency on men has lessened. There's good sex and bad sex for today's romantic heroine, and in detail, too: she goes out to work, worries about her job, her character, her looks and her weight. Unlike Madame Bovary and Anna Karenina, she does not have to be punished for her infidelities. She is usually written, and read, by other women. Her life is not without real problems. Social issues can surface - in Someone Like You, they are Alzheimer's and infertility.</p> <p>So how do you tell romantic fiction from the rest? Salman Rushdie's The Ground Beneath Her Feet could be seen as sexual love in idealised form: it's certainly long enough, too. But he's not exactly going to join the Romantic Novelists' Association.</p> <p>The style of writing, perhaps? It's effective, certainly: precise and vivid, but tends to the heavy-handed. Sentences are weighed down with adjectives and adverbs: luscious, glowing, rippling, tumbling; gracefully, haltingly, languidly. Long, slender limbs are stretched and it's a rare character who simply speaks: he or she groans, growls, confides, teases, snaps, grins, squeals or roars. Mouths are bruised and sullen. And no jokes, please, no irony. This is not, repeat not, the literature of alienation.</p> <p>But mostly it's just the view from the windows. See it like this.

      "bodyText": "Last week, Cathy Kelly became the Romantic Novelist of the Year, winning \u00a35,000 and very little respect from the critics. This is par for the course in the world of romantic fiction: you earn a lot and die unnoticed. \"Romantic\" novels are the mainstay of publishers' fiction lists: know them in their pure form by their thickness (Kelly's Someone Like You is 677 pages long), the blue and gold or violet and silver jackets, and the fetching girl on the cover; see them everywhere, on newsagents' shelves and in the supermarket - buy them, discounted, along with your lottery ticket, that other hope of future bliss. The market is huge and growing - 182m books sold worldwide back in 1996, and add to that the recent chic-lit phenomena, the Bridget Jones lookalikes, and a massive influx of new young female devotees to the genre. All the genre novels have a hard time in literary circles - science fiction gets a bad press, crime thrillers (unless they're John le Carr\u00e9) are shrugged off - but special abuse is reserved for the romantic novel. I suspect we struggle against ourselves. It's the junk food of the literary appetite - fills you up but fails to nourish. Dangerous. Personally I read Someone Like You into the early hours and enjoyed it very much, though skipping the office detail, like pushing the gherkin to the edge of the plate, preferring to focus on the loss and longing bits, not to mention the clothes. I'm so glad Hannah got David in the end: I really am. Felix was bound to be trouble. Of course women can live happy and fulfilled lives without men - and perhaps they should try to, and certainly often have to. It's just, well, you know. You can dream, can't you? And it's not as if falling in love isn't real: we've all been there, done that. So OK, it was a rush of endorphins to the brain, a flood of hormones, a flurry of neurotic dependency because of what your father did - but it felt like romance at the time, if only for a moment. And the more they try to train you out of it, the more late-night hooker programmes they thrust at you on TV - so that's all sex is, yuk! - the more insanely you'll cling to those moments when you felt most alive and knew what you were on this earth for. Love. And you'll reach for the blue and gold, the violet and silver. \"A novel that deals with sexual love in idealised form\" is the formal definition of the romantic novel, but the pattern has changed, as have women's lives, and their practical dependency on men has lessened. There's good sex and bad sex for today's romantic heroine, and in detail, too: she goes out to work, worries about her job, her character, her looks and her weight. Unlike Madame Bovary and Anna Karenina, she does not have to be punished for her infidelities. She is usually written, and read, by other women. Her life is not without real problems. Social issues can surface - in Someone Like You, they are Alzheimer's and infertility. So how do you tell romantic fiction from the rest? Salman Rushdie's The Ground Beneath Her Feet could be seen as sexual love in idealised form: it's certainly long enough, too. But he's not exactly going to join the Romantic Novelists' Association. The style of writing, perhaps? It's effective, certainly: precise and vivid, but tends to the heavy-handed. Sentences are weighed down with adjectives and adverbs: luscious, glowing, rippling, tumbling; gracefully, haltingly, languidly. Long, slender limbs are stretched and it's a rare character who simply speaks: he or she groans, growls, confides, teases, snaps, grins, squeals or roars. Mouths are bruised and sullen. And no jokes, please, no irony. This is not, repeat not, the literature of alienation. But mostly it's just the view from the windows. See it like this. See all of literature as the City of Invention, the celestial city of the imagination. It's where writers go, over the centuries, to build their houses, choosing the best area they can afford, talent allowing. It's where the readers flock, as tourists, to take a holiday from their lives, and come back to reality refreshed. The critics are the guides, the publishers are the estate agents. The city has its desirable districts and its bad. Castle Shakespeare looms over all, insisting on building standards few live up to.

Over there, crime - lean out of the coaches and take a wave at the twin mayors, Rendell and James - and there, see, stretching into the distance, the vast, pretty suburb of romance, all neat gardens and lace curtains, with spotlessly clean pavements - this is where the guides get off. None of these houses looks outside to the real world. Draw back the lace curtains in the sci-fi district and see outer space and bug-eyed monsters; if it's the Pentagon and an eternal Checkpoint Charlie, why then you're in thrillers.

Some 150 colleges will be designated by 2004-5. </p> <p>However some key questions remain to be answered about precisely how the new initiative is going to work. </p> <p>Some say that this was a wheeze dreamt up by Tony Blair's education adviser, Andrew Adonis, who saw specialising working well in schools and sixth-form colleges. Adonis, it is said, wondered why further education colleges - which were often not performing especially well and were seen to have lost touch with the needs of employers - should not specialise as well. </p> <p>It was then left, so it goes, to civil servants, the new Learning and Skills Council and the Learning and Skills Development Agency to put some flesh on the bones of his idea. </p> <p>So now colleges, together with their local learning and skills councils, will assess present and future local skill needs and attempt to meet them in a more planned and co-ordinated manner. </p> <p>The Learning and Skills Development Agency has been asked by the Learning and Skills Council to help identify colleges which already have areas of excellent skills training that might qualify them as \"pathfinder\" centres of vocational excellence. The plan is to come up with a shortlist of up to 40 such colleges from which 12-15 may eventually be designated. </p> <p>These pathfinder colleges should be exemplars of good practice as recognised by inspection reports and will act as mentors for colleges seeking vocational excellence status in future. </p> <p>The second phase in the summer is to publish the criteria by which a much greater number of colleges will be designated as centres of vocational excellence in future. </p> <p>In March the DfEE published a consultation paper on the proposal to which responses must be received by June 19 2001. </p> <p>A number of key issues have yet to be resolved. Chris Hughes, chief executive, Learning and Skills Development Agency, says that the initiative will only work if it makes colleges more focused on working with employers as clients. It is about being involved in employers' business planning and anticipating future skill needs, as opposed to just laying on some courses. </p> <p>He added that further education has two distinct traditions - one is that of offering technical and vocational education and the other is of access and giving people opportunities. It may be, he added, that the latter tradition has been stronger than the first one in recent years and there is now a need to return to being leading edge technical and vocational institutions. </p> <p>Once the centres of vocational excellence are established, the next task is to identify ways of transferring good practice to other colleges. In order to avoid creating a second tier of colleges that perceive themselves to be second rate, it might be necessary to designate colleges for other kinds of excellent practice, for example, community development. </p> <p>The initiative, he added, might well involve some economies of scale and concentration of effort. But then level 3 training in, say, marine or automobile engineering is expensive and already concentrated in specialist centres anyway. </p> <p>David Sherlock, chief inspector of the Adult Learning Inspectorate, asks why the initiative is restricted to colleges and not extended to sixth-form colleges, or to the private sector which undertakes some \u00a312bn of training annually. He also asks how industry will benefit from the initiative? He adds that there has to be something special about the curriculum, for example trainees spending substantial amounts of time in industry, if there is to be a real partnership with industry. </p> <p>However Sherlock says that such centres could work very well in some industries. For example, in the care industry they could break the downward spiral in work-based training where the already poorly trained train new entrants; or in areas such as gas fitting, railways and IT, where such training centres could offer top-down strategic planning at times of national emergency. </p> <p>Dr John Brennan, director of further education development at the Association of Colleges, said that while the association welcomed the initiative as a way of enhancing the status and capability of colleges, there are also dangers. </p> <p>If one college is designated a centre of excellence, does another college down the road with the same area of vocational provision disband its department? He favours a networking partnership model which would allow other non-designated colleges a role in providing progression routes into the specialist programme. </p> <p>He also asks, how do you define excellence? In some industries, for example, catering and business administration, some 2-300 colleges offer training. So do you have 50 centres of excellence, or 100? </p> <p>If you concentrate provision in a particular college, then students will have to travel to that centre and who is to pay for these travelling costs? </p> <p>Dr Brennan said: \"I think there are some quite big questions around all of this, which have got to be resolved. I don't think as yet the department has produced answers to all of those questions and, in part, this consultation is about trying to refine some of those answers.\"</p>",

So now colleges, together with their local learning and skills councils, will assess present and future local skill needs and attempt to meet them in a more planned and co-ordinated manner. The Learning and Skills Development Agency has been asked by the Learning and Skills Council to help identify colleges which already have areas of excellent skills training that might qualify them as \"pathfinder\" centres of vocational excellence. The plan is to come up with a shortlist of up to 40 such colleges from which 12-15 may eventually be designated. These pathfinder colleges should be exemplars of good practice as recognised by inspection reports and will act as mentors for colleges seeking vocational excellence status in future. The second phase in the summer is to publish the criteria by which a much greater number of colleges will be designated as centres of vocational excellence in future. In March the DfEE published a consultation paper on the proposal to which responses must be received by June 19 2001. A number of key issues have yet to be resolved. Chris Hughes, chief executive, Learning and Skills Development Agency, says that the initiative will only work if it makes colleges more focused on working with employers as clients. It is about being involved in employers' business planning and anticipating future skill needs, as opposed to just laying on some courses. He added that further education has two distinct traditions - one is that of offering technical and vocational education and the other is of access and giving people opportunities. It may be, he added, that the latter tradition has been stronger than the first one in recent years and there is now a need to return to being leading edge technical and vocational institutions. Once the centres of vocational excellence are established, the next task is to identify ways of transferring good practice to other colleges. In order to avoid creating a second tier of colleges that perceive themselves to be second rate, it might be necessary to designate colleges for other kinds of excellent practice, for example, community development. The initiative, he added, might well involve some economies of scale and concentration of effort. But then level 3 training in, say, marine or automobile engineering is expensive and already concentrated in specialist centres anyway. David Sherlock, chief inspector of the Adult Learning Inspectorate, asks why the initiative is restricted to colleges and not extended to sixth-form colleges, or to the private sector which undertakes some \u00a312bn of training annually. He also asks how industry will benefit from the initiative? He adds that there has to be something special about the curriculum, for example trainees spending substantial amounts of time in industry, if there is to be a real partnership with industry. However Sherlock says that such centres could work very well in some industries. For example, in the care industry they could break the downward spiral in work-based training where the already poorly trained train new entrants; or in areas such as gas fitting, railways and IT, where such training centres could offer top-down strategic planning at times of national emergency. Dr John Brennan, director of further education development at the Association of Colleges, said that while the association welcomed the initiative as a way of enhancing the status and capability of colleges, there are also dangers. If one college is designated a centre of excellence, does another college down the road with the same area of vocational provision disband its department? He favours a networking partnership model which would allow other non-designated colleges a role in providing progression routes into the specialist programme. He also asks, how do you define excellence? In some industries, for example, catering and business administration, some 2-300 colleges offer training. So do you have 50 centres of excellence, or 100? If you concentrate provision in a particular college, then students will have to travel to that centre and who is to pay for these travelling costs? Dr Brennan said: \"I think there are some quite big questions around all of this, which have got to be resolved. I don't think as yet the department has produced answers to all of those questions and, in part, this consultation is about trying to refine some of those answers.\"",

The latest national curriculum has been compulsory - all of it - since September 2000. It's the literacy and numeracy strategies that have never been compulsory. </p> <p>Nor is the citizenship programme in primary schools. It's a pity that your governor didn't check facts with the DfEE's Guide to the Law for School Governors to save further misunderstandings. </p> <p><b>Mike Brogden</b><br>Much Wenlock, Shropshire </p> <p><b> Not quite above board</b><br> </p> <p> Your governor has the wrong information (On the board, April 24). </p> <p>The decision to remove a governor on the grounds of poor attendance is one for the governing body, not the headteacher. </p> <p>Neither is the six-month rule an absolute one. Governors can approve absence - which may be entirely unavoidable, for example illness. </p> <p>With regard to the national curriculum, it is the \"freelance writer of educational books\" who is out of date. Whilst there was some relaxation of the foundation subjects while the literacy and numeracy strategies were being introduced, their statutory status was returned from September 2000. </p> <p>Having said that, the foundation curriculum is by no means as prescriptive as some teachers would have you believe. </p> <p><b>Roger Watts</b><br> Chesterfield, Derbyshire</p> <p><b> Snob sentiments</b><br> </p> <p> I have been offered a conditional place at Oxford next year and am disturbed by the sentiments of Jen Taylor and Simon Newton (Letters, April 10 and April 17). </p> <p>Mr Newton, my state tertiary college not only encouraged my Oxford application, but supported it throughout, offering practice interviews and the like. </p> <p>Ms Taylor and Mr Newton, I firmly reject the inference that all Oxford students feel somehow \"better\" than the \u00a36,000 being offered to trainee teachers. </p> <p>I resent the suggestion that students are shaped by their institution. We're all individuals, Mr Newton, and an Oxford degree doesn't turn one automatically into a snob. </p> <p>Ms Taylor, if your job satisfaction comes in the form of a fat paycheck I wish you just as much luck as if it was a classroom full of succeeding students. I believe young people are capable of making their own decisions, whichever university they attend (or not), fully backed by their state education. </p> <p><b>Clare Langley</b><br> by email</p> <p><b> Circles are central</b><br> </p> <p> While it was good to see the value of peer support featured so prominently (Education, April 17), it is sad that it still remains a bolt-on to an essentially academic curriculum. </p> <p>Driving up standards and promoting social inclusion were always potentially incompatible yet, compared to funding for literacy and numeracy, the resources directed towards making schools comfortable, both emotionally and socially, for children with special needs, have been minimal. </p> <p>Creating a Circle of Friends not only transforms the life of the focus child, but helps to make the wider school community more tolerant and respectful of diversity. </p> <p>Having been involved in setting up a Circle of Friends in secondary school, I have been dismayed by the routine bullying that the young person was previously subjected to (and which teachers were largely unaware of). </p> <p>Yes, a Circle of Friends is relatively inexpensive in terms of hard cash, but to listen to young people does require time, proper training and a recognition that educating the emotions is as central to the curriculum as literacy and numeracy. </p> <p> <b> Carole Morgan</b><br> by email </p> <p><b> Cut the red tape</b><br> </p> <p> My wife returned to work after bringing up our family, gaining a degree as a mature student and completing a postgraduate certificate in education. No mean feat. </p> <p>She entered the profession teaching business studies with a wealth of experience gained in commercial environments. She has taught at three secondary schools. In her experience the major problems in education are as follows: </p> <p>Pay. This falls far behind that of any comparable professions in commerce, for example accountancy. </p> <p>Personnel management. Most manager-to-staff relationships seem to be a mixture of bullying and nepotism. People-managing skills are non-existent. </p> <p>Peer relationships. With the refreshing exception, to each other teachers are arrogant, disloyal, unsupportive, sniping, critical in front of pupils and generally lacking in team spirit. </p> <p>Physical environment. The facilities endured by teachers are abysmal compared to industry; sharing desks, computers and dirty, cramped offices where lessons are prepared and marked. Schools are poorly resourced and managed. </p> <p>Teachers don't need more red tape. They need better pay and professional management and support to do the job they are trained for. </p> <p> <b> R D Roberts</b><br>Witham, Essex </p> <p><b> What's in a grade?</b><br> </p> <p> I have just finished unravelling the intricacies of the GCSE sets and exam format. </p> <p>A, B and C are still the pass grades for GCSE (the old O-level), but for foundation-level maths, a student cannot gain a pass grade because the highest available is D - even for a mark of 100%. And everyone gets a grade, even if they score just 2%; for foundation it's D, E, F, and G.

      "bodyText": "Compulsory - it's a fact The parent governor has got things back to front (On the board, April 24). The latest national curriculum has been compulsory - all of it - since September 2000. It's the literacy and numeracy strategies that have never been compulsory. Nor is the citizenship programme in primary schools. It's a pity that your governor didn't check facts with the DfEE's Guide to the Law for School Governors to save further misunderstandings. Mike Brogden Much Wenlock, Shropshire Not quite above board Your governor has the wrong information (On the board, April 24). The decision to remove a governor on the grounds of poor attendance is one for the governing body, not the headteacher. Neither is the six-month rule an absolute one. Governors can approve absence - which may be entirely unavoidable, for example illness. With regard to the national curriculum, it is the \"freelance writer of educational books\" who is out of date. Whilst there was some relaxation of the foundation subjects while the literacy and numeracy strategies were being introduced, their statutory status was returned from September 2000. Having said that, the foundation curriculum is by no means as prescriptive as some teachers would have you believe. Roger Watts Chesterfield, Derbyshire Snob sentiments I have been offered a conditional place at Oxford next year and am disturbed by the sentiments of Jen Taylor and Simon Newton (Letters, April 10 and April 17). Mr Newton, my state tertiary college not only encouraged my Oxford application, but supported it throughout, offering practice interviews and the like. Ms Taylor and Mr Newton, I firmly reject the inference that all Oxford students feel somehow \"better\" than the \u00a36,000 being offered to trainee teachers. I resent the suggestion that students are shaped by their institution. We're all individuals, Mr Newton, and an Oxford degree doesn't turn one automatically into a snob. Ms Taylor, if your job satisfaction comes in the form of a fat paycheck I wish you just as much luck as if it was a classroom full of succeeding students. I believe young people are capable of making their own decisions, whichever university they attend (or not), fully backed by their state education. Clare Langley by email Circles are central While it was good to see the value of peer support featured so prominently (Education, April 17), it is sad that it still remains a bolt-on to an essentially academic curriculum. Driving up standards and promoting social inclusion were always potentially incompatible yet, compared to funding for literacy and numeracy, the resources directed towards making schools comfortable, both emotionally and socially, for children with special needs, have been minimal. Creating a Circle of Friends not only transforms the life of the focus child, but helps to make the wider school community more tolerant and respectful of diversity. Having been involved in setting up a Circle of Friends in secondary school, I have been dismayed by the routine bullying that the young person was previously subjected to (and which teachers were largely unaware of). Yes, a Circle of Friends is relatively inexpensive in terms of hard cash, but to listen to young people does require time, proper training and a recognition that educating the emotions is as central to the curriculum as literacy and numeracy. Carole Morgan by email Cut the red tape My wife returned to work after bringing up our family, gaining a degree as a mature student and completing a postgraduate certificate in education. No mean feat. She entered the profession teaching business studies with a wealth of experience gained in commercial environments. She has taught at three secondary schools. In her experience the major problems in education are as follows: Pay. This falls far behind that of any comparable professions in commerce, for example accountancy. Personnel management. Most manager-to-staff relationships seem to be a mixture of bullying and nepotism. People-managing skills are non-existent. Peer relationships. With the refreshing exception, to each other teachers are arrogant, disloyal, unsupportive, sniping, critical in front of pupils and generally lacking in team spirit. Physical environment. The facilities endured by teachers are abysmal compared to industry; sharing desks, computers and dirty, cramped offices where lessons are prepared and marked. Schools are poorly resourced and managed. Teachers don't need more red tape. They need better pay and professional management and support to do the job they are trained for. R D Roberts Witham, Essex What's in a grade? I have just finished unravelling the intricacies of the GCSE sets and exam format. A, B and C are still the pass grades for GCSE (the old O-level), but for foundation-level maths, a student cannot gain a pass grade because the highest available is D - even for a mark of 100%. And everyone gets a grade, even if they score just 2%; for foundation it's D, E, F, and G. In some subjects at intermediate level, only a C grade is awarded for a mark of 80% and above. This is an educational system catering for children who are supposedly unable to achieve. What sort of mentality says \"if at first you don't achieve, go down a set and then you will be able to get the answers right (because we will make the questions easier for you)\"? If a child achieves a pass in an intermediate paper instead of a higher paper, is the result worthy of the title GCSE O-level? In the \"old days\" the lower paper was called a CSE. And are the children left in the lower levels missing out on that chance to excel and pass a GCSE?

If we are serious about creating a society of lifetime learners can we afford to ignore the opportunities to learn at work for such a large segment of the population? Our competitors in south-east Asia are taking this very seriously, with educational and training programmes targeted at this group of manual workers, who are most at risk in the new economy. Is it not time for us to do the same and send Nellie into a well-earned retirement?

      "bodyText": "SATs revision Revisewise www.bbc.co.uk/education/revisewise Suitable for KS2 pupils An excellent site designed to run in parallel with the television programmes of the same name, although it can be used independently. Maths, English and science are available and there is a choice of activities, factsheets and tests, which aremarked. Within each subject there is a good choice of theme, enabling children to work on their weaknesses. There are also game zones for some light relief after all the hard work. Woodlands www.woodlands-junior.kent.sch.uk/revision/index_main.html Suitable for KS2 pupils &amp; teachers This is a colourful site, providing sample questions from past papers and essential facts. The English pages include a spelling test, parts of a sentence and grammar links. Within the maths section, there is an interactive mental arithmetic test. Sats School www.sats-school.co.uk Suitable for KS2 pupils &amp; teachers The impressive graphics on this site are a major attraction although the content isn't so easy to use, as some areas are restricted to members. Children intending to make good use of the facilities (such as online tutorial support) would find it worthwhile to join. There are plenty of revision activities organised on a weekly basis. Sam Learning Scheme www.freeserve.net/education/examrevision Suitable for: KS1/2 pupils, teachers and parents KS1 material offers maths or English (with a small \"e\"!). The four rules are available in the maths pages and the children can take simple tests - but the result is given in percentages, which will not make much sense to a year 2. KS2 material offers a fairly good choice of material in maths and English but the science activities are divided into a choice of biology, chemistry and physics, terms which will be unfamiliar to most year 6 children. However, within those sub-headings there are the more familiar theme headings such as life processes, forces and materials. The solar system An introduction www.howstuffworks.com Suitable for KS4/5 pupils &amp; teachers Although limited on the solar system in general, it does have illustrated descriptions of the Sun and interplanetary travel. Astroweb cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/astroweb.html Suitable for KS3/4/5 pupils &amp; teachers Links to all aspects of astronomy, from university research departments to dedicated educational websites. Another very useful starting point. The planets (1) www.bbc.co.uk/planets/ Suitable for KS3/4/5 pupils The BBC's planetary tour offers comprehensive descriptions. As a bonus, the site includes star map-making facilities, a quiz and links. The planets (2) pds.jpl.nasa.gov/planets/ Suitable for KS5 pupils &amp; teachers Virtually every hard-to-find fact you may ever wish to know, and this site includes surface images. Keep a science dictionary handy, as technical terms are not explained.

      "body": "<p>Everyone thought she was crazy. Why would anybody send their talented musician daughter, who had won places at private and top-performing state schools, to an inner London secondary where only one-third of a per cent of pupils achieved five GCSEs at grade A-C? </p> <p>But four years later Frances Jagodinska's risk has paid off. The school, St Marylebone, is now the most improved in the country, according to the DfEE. Last year 89% of students attained those grades and it has Beacon School status in performing arts. Her daughter, now 13, is extremely happy there, and, says Jagodinska, the school is getting better all the time. Every year it gets harder to get into. </p> <p>How did Jagodinska get ahead of the pack? A teacher and lecturer for more than 20 years, she did her homework. She looked at league tables, Ofsted reports, even old local authority reports in the public library for 22 schools. She worked out that St Marylebone had gone through a bad patch several years earlier and its reputation had never recovered. But since the current head, Elizabeth Phillips, had arrived, results had improved dramatically and the school had won Performing Arts College status, which would attract more funding and improve facilities. </p> <p>But more than anything, Jagodinska relied on her gut instinct: \"The school had a good atmosphere, it looked welcoming, the staff were upbeat and the girls polite,\" she observed. \"The intake is very mixed, but there is a very good can-do spirit.\" </p> <p>With many parents now paying up to 20% more for a home to live within the ever-shrinking catchment area of a good school, and many more suffering sleepless nights after receiving rejection letters from the school they wanted, such insight is priceless. </p> <p>But now a group of researchers believe they have come up with a formula which will allow any parent to spot a school that may not have a great reputation, but is about to. </p> <p>The Hay Group, a leading international human resources consultancy, were asked by the government to look into what makes highly effective teachers and heads, and concluded that creating the right atmosphere in classrooms is a major factor. Improved results, they claim, are bound to follow. </p> <p>And they came up with some guidelines for parents: follow their advice, they say, and you will be able to spot those schools that, a couple of years down the line, other parents will be queuing round the block to get into. </p> <p>Hay, which also helped develop the award-winning Leadership Programme for Serving Headteachers (LPSH), spoke to hundreds of teachers, parents and academics to find out what really made a difference. But most important of all, they say, is to ask the pupils. \"Our research showed there is a clear link between how pupils feel in the classroom and success in exam results and inspections,\" says Hay's Russell Hobby. </p> <p>\"We checked against the value-added progress that pupils made [ie how much the children had achieved given their abilities on entering the school] and standards of achievement and came out with nine components of successful learning. If potential parents are aware of these, they can identify schools where long-term success can be predicted, even when it may not be obvious to others.\" </p> <p>In other words, a school may come way down the league tables, but still be good. Given a more able or motivated intake, its results will soon soar. </p> <p>The group designed questionnaires that tested these nine components in classrooms across the country. More than 30,000 children have now completed them, and the consultancy has developed a potted version that parents can ask, for example at open days, to establish if the school offers the right \"climate\" for progress and how effectively children are learning. </p> <p>But the Hay Group's findings are not simply designed to assist parents in the increasingly bitter battle for places. It is also hoped that the research will help spot a school which is on the way up, and help others improve more rapidly. </p> <p>For things to change, however, teachers must take pupils' views into account. To this end, Hay has developed a commercial website that enables individual teachers, in total confidence, to access the results of their own pupils' questionnairesand work out a course of action. </p> <p>Kingsthorpe Community College in Northampton participated in the pilot scheme last year, and staff there are among the first to use the website, which went live in January. Trevor Arrowsmith, the head, says: \"The research is well-grounded and staff find it a powerful and efficacious tool.\" </p> <p>But it is early days yet. \"It is not an instant fix - it's a long term thing.\" </p> <p>He confirms that the nine key factors are linked to better performance. \"If you get all these things up to where they should be you are bound to see improvements. Some of the nine elements are very similar to some Ofsted criteria, so working on them should result in better inspection reports.\" </p> <p>Some of the thinking is not new, he concedes, what is different is getting the feedback from pupils. \"It makes the job of the teacher more manageable because the students are going to be more focused if there is clarity and fairness, for example,\" he says. </p> <p>\"It's better value for money than many other commercial packages where staff pay \u00a3200, go away for the day and come back with a ring-binder. I have 87 teachers who can all access the website - that is incredibly cost effective.\" </p> <p>Cynics might say that Hay's findings are simply another government ruse for putting all the onus for improvement onto teachers, and that the consultancy is cashing in on a new market created by performance related pay, while schools stump up the money - from \u00a3500 to \u00a32,000 pounds depending on the size of the school - to use the website. </p> <p>How can a school in a deprived area, for example, turn itself around if the clientele is the same and there is no extra funding to improve facilities? </p> <p>Jeff Richardson took on a school that was at rock bottom. He is head of Wexham Secondary School in Slough, a non-selective comprehensive in an area where 30% of pupils attend grammar schools. He arrived when the school was formed in 1987 by the merger of two others which had closed against total opposition from staff and parents. Within three years of Mr Richardson taking over, Wexham was oversubscribed. </p> <p>There was never a precise moment when he felt the school had turned a corner; he always believed it would. But there were signs that parents could pick up on. \"Change was incremental. The first year I took over the GCSE results were abysmal. Only 1%-2% per cent were getting five at grade C or above. Now that's 29%. And the number getting a pass of any description has risen from 50% to almost 100%.\" </p> <p>He points to two Ofsted reports and an LEA report that highlighted improvements. Another defining moment was five years after his arrival, when every pupil in the school had always been a Wexham pupil, sharing the same values from the word go. Establishing a PTA was another marker. So was a Sportsmark award from the DfEE for quality, range and involvement in physical education. </p> <p>Richardson's philosophy reflects the Hay findings that pupils matter. \"Only they can tell you what it really feels like to be at this school,\" he says. Knowing that Wexham's reputation would lag behind its achievements, Richardson made a point of welcoming visitors so that views were not based on hearsay, especially if they had contacted him to complain about behaviour outside the school gates. All this sends a message to pupils that he is not ashamed of them. </p> <p>As for Frances Jagodinska, she has been ignoring received wisdom again. She is about to take a chance with a school for her son, now in his last year at primary. He will be attending London Nautical School in Southwark, where there is an emphasis on seafaring skills. \"It has a reputation for being discplinarian, traditionalist and non-academic,\" she says. But Jagodinska believes this does not reflect recent improvements in performance and Ofsted ratings. She also believes it is right for her child. \"My son likes the nautical bit and he's also keen on the arts, one of the school's strong points. And I liked the head.\" </p> <p>So, if you want to know if a school is really getting better, the answer, it seems, is do your homework and ask those who really know - the pupils. </p> <p> Visit the Hay Group's website at <a href=\"http://www.transforminglearning.co.uk\">www.transforminglearning.co.uk</a> </p> <p><strong>Ask the children</strong></p> <p>The Hay Group have identified nine tell-tale signs that a school is on the verge of becoming good. To spot the signs, talk to the pupils. </p> <p><strong>1.

      "bodyText": "Everyone thought she was crazy. Why would anybody send their talented musician daughter, who had won places at private and top-performing state schools, to an inner London secondary where only one-third of a per cent of pupils achieved five GCSEs at grade A-C? But four years later Frances Jagodinska's risk has paid off. The school, St Marylebone, is now the most improved in the country, according to the DfEE. Last year 89% of students attained those grades and it has Beacon School status in performing arts. Her daughter, now 13, is extremely happy there, and, says Jagodinska, the school is getting better all the time. Every year it gets harder to get into. How did Jagodinska get ahead of the pack? A teacher and lecturer for more than 20 years, she did her homework. She looked at league tables, Ofsted reports, even old local authority reports in the public library for 22 schools. She worked out that St Marylebone had gone through a bad patch several years earlier and its reputation had never recovered. But since the current head, Elizabeth Phillips, had arrived, results had improved dramatically and the school had won Performing Arts College status, which would attract more funding and improve facilities. But more than anything, Jagodinska relied on her gut instinct: \"The school had a good atmosphere, it looked welcoming, the staff were upbeat and the girls polite,\" she observed. \"The intake is very mixed, but there is a very good can-do spirit.\" With many parents now paying up to 20% more for a home to live within the ever-shrinking catchment area of a good school, and many more suffering sleepless nights after receiving rejection letters from the school they wanted, such insight is priceless. But now a group of researchers believe they have come up with a formula which will allow any parent to spot a school that may not have a great reputation, but is about to. The Hay Group, a leading international human resources consultancy, were asked by the government to look into what makes highly effective teachers and heads, and concluded that creating the right atmosphere in classrooms is a major factor. Improved results, they claim, are bound to follow. And they came up with some guidelines for parents: follow their advice, they say, and you will be able to spot those schools that, a couple of years down the line, other parents will be queuing round the block to get into. Hay, which also helped develop the award-winning Leadership Programme for Serving Headteachers (LPSH), spoke to hundreds of teachers, parents and academics to find out what really made a difference. But most important of all, they say, is to ask the pupils. \"Our research showed there is a clear link between how pupils feel in the classroom and success in exam results and inspections,\" says Hay's Russell Hobby. \"We checked against the value-added progress that pupils made [ie how much the children had achieved given their abilities on entering the school] and standards of achievement and came out with nine components of successful learning. If potential parents are aware of these, they can identify schools where long-term success can be predicted, even when it may not be obvious to others.\" In other words, a school may come way down the league tables, but still be good. Given a more able or motivated intake, its results will soon soar. The group designed questionnaires that tested these nine components in classrooms across the country. More than 30,000 children have now completed them, and the consultancy has developed a potted version that parents can ask, for example at open days, to establish if the school offers the right \"climate\" for progress and how effectively children are learning. But the Hay Group's findings are not simply designed to assist parents in the increasingly bitter battle for places. It is also hoped that the research will help spot a school which is on the way up, and help others improve more rapidly. For things to change, however, teachers must take pupils' views into account. To this end, Hay has developed a commercial website that enables individual teachers, in total confidence, to access the results of their own pupils' questionnairesand work out a course of action. Kingsthorpe Community College in Northampton participated in the pilot scheme last year, and staff there are among the first to use the website, which went live in January. Trevor Arrowsmith, the head, says: \"The research is well-grounded and staff find it a powerful and efficacious tool.\" But it is early days yet. \"It is not an instant fix - it's a long term thing.\" He confirms that the nine key factors are linked to better performance. \"If you get all these things up to where they should be you are bound to see improvements. Some of the nine elements are very similar to some Ofsted criteria, so working on them should result in better inspection reports.\" Some of the thinking is not new, he concedes, what is different is getting the feedback from pupils. \"It makes the job of the teacher more manageable because the students are going to be more focused if there is clarity and fairness, for example,\" he says. \"It's better value for money than many other commercial packages where staff pay \u00a3200, go away for the day and come back with a ring-binder. I have 87 teachers who can all access the website - that is incredibly cost effective.\" Cynics might say that Hay's findings are simply another government ruse for putting all the onus for improvement onto teachers, and that the consultancy is cashing in on a new market created by performance related pay, while schools stump up the money - from \u00a3500 to \u00a32,000 pounds depending on the size of the school - to use the website. How can a school in a deprived area, for example, turn itself around if the clientele is the same and there is no extra funding to improve facilities? Jeff Richardson took on a school that was at rock bottom. He is head of Wexham Secondary School in Slough, a non-selective comprehensive in an area where 30% of pupils attend grammar schools. He arrived when the school was formed in 1987 by the merger of two others which had closed against total opposition from staff and parents. Within three years of Mr Richardson taking over, Wexham was oversubscribed. There was never a precise moment when he felt the school had turned a corner; he always believed it would. But there were signs that parents could pick up on. \"Change was incremental. The first year I took over the GCSE results were abysmal. Only 1%-2% per cent were getting five at grade C or above. Now that's 29%. And the number getting a pass of any description has risen from 50% to almost 100%.\" He points to two Ofsted reports and an LEA report that highlighted improvements. Another defining moment was five years after his arrival, when every pupil in the school had always been a Wexham pupil, sharing the same values from the word go. Establishing a PTA was another marker. So was a Sportsmark award from the DfEE for quality, range and involvement in physical education. Richardson's philosophy reflects the Hay findings that pupils matter. \"Only they can tell you what it really feels like to be at this school,\" he says. Knowing that Wexham's reputation would lag behind its achievements, Richardson made a point of welcoming visitors so that views were not based on hearsay, especially if they had contacted him to complain about behaviour outside the school gates. All this sends a message to pupils that he is not ashamed of them. As for Frances Jagodinska, she has been ignoring received wisdom again. She is about to take a chance with a school for her son, now in his last year at primary. He will be attending London Nautical School in Southwark, where there is an emphasis on seafaring skills. \"It has a reputation for being discplinarian, traditionalist and non-academic,\" she says. But Jagodinska believes this does not reflect recent improvements in performance and Ofsted ratings. She also believes it is right for her child. \"My son likes the nautical bit and he's also keen on the arts, one of the school's strong points. And I liked the head.\" So, if you want to know if a school is really getting better, the answer, it seems, is do your homework and ask those who really know - the pupils. Visit the Hay Group's website at www.transforminglearning.co.uk Ask the children The Hay Group have identified nine tell-tale signs that a school is on the verge of becoming good. To spot the signs, talk to the pupils. 1. Interest You can't force children to learn but if you create a buzz and make learning fun and exciting, they will lap it up. Ask Do you enjoy coming into class? Would you come to school if you didn't have to? 2. Standards Do staff and pupils carry with them a sense of excellence and ambition? Ask Are you always expected to try hard? Do you find the work you are set can be quite difficult? 3. Clarity Knowing why you are doing something helps you do it better. Ask When you study something, are you clear about which bits you will be tested on? By the end of the lesson, do you know what you were supposed to have learned? 4. Safety Children cannot pay attention if they are distracted by fear. Ask In class, do pupils ever damage each other's things or hurt each other? 5. Support Everyone makes mistakes, especially when they are being stretched. If pupils think they will be laughed at they won't bother. Ask Is it OK to say when you don't understand something? Do pupils help each other to solve problems? 6. Fairness Noticing effort and rewarding it consistently are vital if children are going to keep trying. Ask If you do your best, are you praised for it? Are good marks ever given out when someone hasn't done a good piece of work? 7. Participation Do all pupils have the chance to ask questions, discuss issues and work in small groups. Ask Do you get the chance to discuss things in class? Are you encouraged to say what you think in lessons? 8. Environment A dirty, drab room implies children are not important and encourages them to treat their work in the same way. Ask Is your classroom clean and tidy? Do you think it looks nice? 9. Order Buzz must be balanced with a sense of discipline and structure. Ask Do lessons usually start and finish on time? Do you pay attention in class?",

The government has pledged to replenish the coffers for staff pay with \u00a3330m over three years. But compared to their colleagues in the public, never mind the private sector, academics have had an embarrassingly raw deal for over a decade. The case for a substantial rise in academic salaries is overwhelming. </p> <p>A sewage operator for Thames Water earns \u00a312,031. With a good, usually first-class degree and a minimum of three years' doctoral study on the CV, most aspiring academics become research assistants earning between \u00a310k and \u00a315k. Assistant escalator staff on the London Underground can expect \u00a322,247 on the night shift. Junior lecturers in their mid- to late 20s have to settle for \u00a316k-\u00a318k. Professors heading a department are rewarded with \u00a349k, while headteachers can command salaries of up to \u00a378k. </p> <p>Unlike the teaching profession, academia has not yet suffered pervasive recruitment problems for several reasons: lecturers have relatively high social status, far greater autonomy, intellectual satisfaction and, crucially, they are not expected to be disciplinarians. </p> <p>But these attractions are under threat as teaching loads become more onerous, incidents of \"challenging\" behaviour among disaffected students are increasing and social status is diminishing with remuneration. The job is bedevilled by insecurity: short-term contracts are prevalent and only 5% have a modicum of stability. </p> <p>The \"swinging 60s timebomb\" is predicted to explode in 2005, when up to one third of academic staff are due to retire. Attracting applications for their replacements in subjects such as law and economics is proving increasingly problematic. Several universities have resorted to financial incentives to fill their PhD places. But a bright graduate is understandably seduced by starting salaries in other areas that wipe out their money worries. </p> <p>Many lecturers complain that their undergrads have landed lucrative deals surpassing their modest salary. So why are the lecturers' unions, Natfhe and the Association of Uni versity Teachers endorsing a policy to subsidise these predominantly middle-class and potentially high-earning students? The support of the lecturers' unions for a campaign to abolish tuition fees and restore maintenance grants is self-defeating, if not suicidal, and, above all, politically naive. The political process demands prioritisation in apportioning limited resources. The budget for HE has been increased under this government. But it is unreasonable to expect the state to meet all financial demands, never mind revert to a policy that is both highly regressive and very costly. </p> <p>One of the key choices facing policy-makers is how to distribute funds between students on one hand and institutions, including staff, on the other. The UK has historically allotted a far greater percentage of the HE budget to financial aid for students than most other countries. Even in 1997 when maintenance grants were minimal, Britain spent 35% of the total budget on student support compared to the OECD average of 19%. Despite the abolition of grants and introduction of fees, this percentage has not greatly diminished. The taxpayer still foots the bill for the interest on loans, a range of grants to lone parents, mature, disadvantaged and disabled students and a hefty 50% of tuition fees. Even the maximum constitutes approximately 25% of the average cost of a course, much less for subjects such as medicine and engineering. </p> <p>If the cause that AUT and Natfhe are backing ever wins the day, surely the first casualty would be any rise in academics' pay! Equally, the first source of funds for additional pay should be the graduates whose earning potential so exceeds their lecturers' that they are shunning the very profession that wants to subsidise them further. </p> <p>So-called \"top-up fees\" are probably the fairest and most feasible method of funding universities, yet one of the most misunderstood and misrepresented of policy proposals. A relatively \"dilute\" differential fee system could lever in enough funds to provide a substantial pay rise. A fee structure reflecting the ratio of real costs of courses could charge the existing \u00a31,000 for classroom-based subjects, \u00a32,000 for laboratory subjects, law and economics and \u00a34,500 for clinical stages of medicine and dentistry courses. The vast majority would contribute no more than \u00a32,000 and the prospective doctors and dentists would almost certainly be subsidised. Yet this scheme would generate almost \u00a3600m of recurrent additional funding across the HE sector - almost exactly the cost of Bett recommendations for an increase in academic pay. Introducing an element of differentiation between institutions would provide a closer correspondence between course costs and rates of return and might even prevent our most talented academics fleeing across the Atlantic. </p> <p>All the caveats about the dangers of deterring the disadvantaged should be heeded. A portion of the money raised should fund targeted maintenance allowances. The repayment threshold should be raised to \u00a320k so most public-sector workers would be granted a few years' grace at the outset of their careers. Most importantly, young academics should be awarded a bursary akin to the \u00a36,000 introduced for trainee teachers. London colleges could use their extra revenue to emulate their US counterparts in providing accommodation for staff. </p> <p>So when the lecturers' unions meet for their annual conference in Scarborough this month, they could focus on defusing rather than detonating the so-called timebomb. A scheme deriving greater contributions from those who profit handsomely from their education might at last achieve the pay rise their members truly deserve. </p> <p>Dr Wendy Piatt is Research Fellow in Education at the Institute for Public Policy Research.</p>",

Assistant escalator staff on the London Underground can expect \u00a322,247 on the night shift. Junior lecturers in their mid- to late 20s have to settle for \u00a316k-\u00a318k. Professors heading a department are rewarded with \u00a349k, while headteachers can command salaries of up to \u00a378k. Unlike the teaching profession, academia has not yet suffered pervasive recruitment problems for several reasons: lecturers have relatively high social status, far greater autonomy, intellectual satisfaction and, crucially, they are not expected to be disciplinarians. But these attractions are under threat as teaching loads become more onerous, incidents of \"challenging\" behaviour among disaffected students are increasing and social status is diminishing with remuneration. The job is bedevilled by insecurity: short-term contracts are prevalent and only 5% have a modicum of stability. The \"swinging 60s timebomb\" is predicted to explode in 2005, when up to one third of academic staff are due to retire. Attracting applications for their replacements in subjects such as law and economics is proving increasingly problematic. Several universities have resorted to financial incentives to fill their PhD places. But a bright graduate is understandably seduced by starting salaries in other areas that wipe out their money worries. Many lecturers complain that their undergrads have landed lucrative deals surpassing their modest salary. So why are the lecturers' unions, Natfhe and the Association of Uni versity Teachers endorsing a policy to subsidise these predominantly middle-class and potentially high-earning students? The support of the lecturers' unions for a campaign to abolish tuition fees and restore maintenance grants is self-defeating, if not suicidal, and, above all, politically naive. The political process demands prioritisation in apportioning limited resources. The budget for HE has been increased under this government. But it is unreasonable to expect the state to meet all financial demands, never mind revert to a policy that is both highly regressive and very costly. One of the key choices facing policy-makers is how to distribute funds between students on one hand and institutions, including staff, on the other. The UK has historically allotted a far greater percentage of the HE budget to financial aid for students than most other countries. Even in 1997 when maintenance grants were minimal, Britain spent 35% of the total budget on student support compared to the OECD average of 19%. Despite the abolition of grants and introduction of fees, this percentage has not greatly diminished. The taxpayer still foots the bill for the interest on loans, a range of grants to lone parents, mature, disadvantaged and disabled students and a hefty 50% of tuition fees. Even the maximum constitutes approximately 25% of the average cost of a course, much less for subjects such as medicine and engineering. If the cause that AUT and Natfhe are backing ever wins the day, surely the first casualty would be any rise in academics' pay! Equally, the first source of funds for additional pay should be the graduates whose earning potential so exceeds their lecturers' that they are shunning the very profession that wants to subsidise them further. So-called \"top-up fees\" are probably the fairest and most feasible method of funding universities, yet one of the most misunderstood and misrepresented of policy proposals. A relatively \"dilute\" differential fee system could lever in enough funds to provide a substantial pay rise. A fee structure reflecting the ratio of real costs of courses could charge the existing \u00a31,000 for classroom-based subjects, \u00a32,000 for laboratory subjects, law and economics and \u00a34,500 for clinical stages of medicine and dentistry courses. The vast majority would contribute no more than \u00a32,000 and the prospective doctors and dentists would almost certainly be subsidised. Yet this scheme would generate almost \u00a3600m of recurrent additional funding across the HE sector - almost exactly the cost of Bett recommendations for an increase in academic pay. Introducing an element of differentiation between institutions would provide a closer correspondence between course costs and rates of return and might even prevent our most talented academics fleeing across the Atlantic. All the caveats about the dangers of deterring the disadvantaged should be heeded. A portion of the money raised should fund targeted maintenance allowances. The repayment threshold should be raised to \u00a320k so most public-sector workers would be granted a few years' grace at the outset of their careers. Most importantly, young academics should be awarded a bursary akin to the \u00a36,000 introduced for trainee teachers. London colleges could use their extra revenue to emulate their US counterparts in providing accommodation for staff. So when the lecturers' unions meet for their annual conference in Scarborough this month, they could focus on defusing rather than detonating the so-called timebomb. A scheme deriving greater contributions from those who profit handsomely from their education might at last achieve the pay rise their members truly deserve.

Your parents have recently divorced, your mum is depressed and withdrawn and you haven't seen your dad for weeks. You feel abandoned by both of them and are desperate for attention. You've always been good at making people laugh and find yourself little by little slipping into a new persona as disruptive, underachieving clown. Other kids love it. Your teachers don't and show it by shouting, criticising and assuming the worst of you before you've even opened your mouth. </p> <p>Now imagine that you're William's maths or English teacher. Something's wrong with this boy, but you don't know what and don't have the time, energy or inclination to find out. From being occasionally silly he's become a full-blown troublemaker whose attention-seeking is a constant irritant and whose underachievement is a real worry. </p> <p>In a class of 28, William has become a thorn in your side. You've tried cajolery, threats and visits to the deputy head, but nothing seems to bother him. He's got a learning mentor who's suggested that he see the school counsellor, but the waiting list is six weeks because she only comes in twice a week. And, frankly, for one 20-minute session a week, who knows if it's going to be any use? All you know is that you can't wait to see the back of him at the end of the year. </p> <p>William's got problems and he's not the only one. There are more troubled children in mainstream schools than ever before. One in five children and adolescents experiences a mental health problem serious enough to warrant professional help, but only 10% to 20% get it. And it's not that the rest don't want help, it's just that, despite the government's drive for early intervention, it doesn't exist in their area. With the rise in the number of children displaying emotional and behavioural difficulties at school, including the worrying escalation in conduct disorder, classroom teachers have very little in their professional armoury to equip them to deal with it. </p> <p>Initial teacher training pays scant attention to child psychology and the vast majority of inset courses focus on curricular subject areas. But without the understanding, expertise or time to deal with these children, teachers can feel overwhelmed, at a loss and defeated by their demands, particularly when set against the diverse needs of the others in the classroom. </p> <p>In this new era of inclusive schools, no one can say how many children have transient or more serious mental health problems that are ignored and who instead get shouted at, sent to the head or are temporarily excluded, again and again until, finally, they never come back. </p> <p>School counselling services are very variable, says Dinah Morley, deputy director of Young Minds, the child's mental health charity. \"Some are linked up with the health authority's child and adolescent mental health services, but many are hit-and-miss with people who may be qualified counsellors, but have no training in working with children. And then there are many school nurses who take on a counselling role without any training, carrying tremendous case loads of children with mental health problems of real concern.\" </p> <p>The plethora of short, general counselling courses on the market and the absence of quality control has led, says Dorothy Eddi Piper of the Trust for the Study of Adolescence, \"to some extraordinarily badly qualified counsellors working in schools. On one course I know of, people get called counsellors after just 15 hours of training.\" In response to the increasing demands on schools, and the absence of appropriate training, Sue Kegerreis, a child and adolescent psychotherapist and school counsellor, has developed what's believed to be the first such course of its kind: an MSc in psychodynamic counselling with children and adolescents, at Birkbeck College, University of London. </p> <p>Designed for professionals working with young people - including teachers, school counsellors, social workers and youth workers - it's an intensive course that provides the insights and strategies they need to work with troubled young people within the formal structures of school. </p> <p>In contrast to the short courses for professionals working with children, the Birkbeck course, which starts in the autumn, is a demanding commitment for employers as much as for participants. It runs one day a week over a period of two years for a diploma, or three years for an MSc, with the final year on placement. In addition, students are required to go through psychotherapy themselves once a week. </p> <p>Schools and LEAs strapped for cash and staff are unlikely to be clamouring for places on such long-term and expensive training courses for counsellors, teachers and related staff. Since the introduction of local management of schools, education authorities no longer employ a pool of specialist counsellors. Instead, schools must buy in themselves, having to choose from the burgeoning market in counselling services run by voluntary and other agencies. </p> <p>Kegerreis aims to sharpen up practice by offering a course focused on how the young person interacts with the school setting as well as with their home and social environment. </p> <p>\"As well as looking at how the conscious and unconscious mind works, psychodynamic counselling is about looking at the relationships around the child and at the impact of the child on people around them,\" she says. \"It's concerned with the child in context, with what's going on around them and with finding a shared understanding with them about why they're feeling and behaving the way they are, rather than just giving them solutions.\" </p> <p>In a case like William's, for instance, psychodynamic counselling would involve the trained adult working with him to see that his disruptive, clownish behaviour was his way of communicating despair and lack of control over his life because of his parents' divorce and their withdrawal from him. </p> <p>\"If the professional just reacts to the child's aggression, it becomes part of the problem,\" says Kegerreis. </p> <p>\"If a child seems wild or out of control, you can get into a situation where you're just condemning the behaviour and can so easily miss out on the underlying problems.\" </p> <p>An important part of the Birkbeck course is the way students are put in a position of understanding what it means to be a pupil, looking at their own relationship to authority and at their own experience as learners. It's something that the increasingly pres surised \"them and us\" culture in schools, which separates professionals from pupils, doesn't allow reflection for. </p> <p>\"It gives students on the course a way of understanding more fully the kinds of things kids are experiencing with teachers, other figures of authority and their peers.

      "body": "<p>In many parts of the world, university academics and students live in perpetual fear. The same is true for teachers in colleges and schools, and increasingly for pupils. For some, this is the reality of life in the first part of the 21st century. Killings, imprisonment, abuse and harassment are on the increase . </p> <p>This is the reason behind a new global watchdog, Network for Education and Academic Rights (Near). Inspired by a meeting called by Unesco early in 2000, it is being launched to aid the rapid transfer of information on a global basis. It will alert those able to take action to protest to governments and international agencies and will quickly inform the leaders of countries with the worst record that their actions are being closely watched by an international community. </p> <p>News about attacks on educational establishments do not often hit the headlines. How many of us have heard that recently in Ethiopia 49 people were killed in clashes, most of these linked to universities and schools? Amnesty International reported that security forces were using \"excessive force against students and other demonstrators\". According to Agence France-Presse (AFP), students and schoolchildren protested and police rounded up protesters, who were demanding greater freedom of expression. </p> <p>A statement from the Addis Ababa University Students Association posted on the net on April 23 said, \"We are in grave danger . . . we want the world to hear our side of the story . . . many students are seriously wounded and are being detained\". Over the last 10 years, university academics have either been forced to flee Ethiopia or been imprisoned. The BBC website shows the student dormitories splattered with blood. </p> <p>Near will provide a site where reports from many sources have been incorporated. </p> <p>Other examples can be found in Afghanistan, Indonesia, Burma, China, Malaysia, Belarus and Uzbekistan - just a small number of countries where those in education are at risk. In Afghanistan, academics were forced to flee from the Taliban regime. Many arrived in Pakistan where they faced further harassment and threats. </p> <p>Academics in Serbia continue to grapple with the legacy of Slobodan Milosevic's attempts to control the universities that served as centres of opposition to his government. The University Act of 1998 subjected faculty members to political oversight and deprived them of the right to select their administrators. As a result of this law Belgrade University alone lost some 180 instructors and professors. </p> <p>The dictator's measures backfired. Opposition to the University Act was one of the central demands of stu dents and academics protesting against the Milosevic government, with many university professors and members of the Serbian Academy of Science and Arts backing Otpor (\"Resistance\"), a loosely structured, student-led opposition movement that played a critical role in Milosevic's electoral defeat. </p> <p>One of the first moves of the new Serbian Minister of Education was to rescind the University Act. While Yugoslav universities now operate under the law as it was before 1998, they still have to deal with those academics who were sacked because of it. Although ministers have suggested a new law, the first drafts have been criticised as insufficiently protective of academic freedom. In the meantime, cases are being looked at individually. </p> <p>As well as these large-scale occurrences, there are countless situations of police detaining individuals who try to leave the country or those who are dismissed from their posts for expressing views opposing the ruling party. One academic was detained recently leaving a Middle East country because he was an outspoken advocate of human rights. He faced imprisonment because of remarks made at an international conference in which he criticised the country's human rights record. </p> <p>Some will say that others face the same risk from totalitarian regimes. Universities and schools, however, are often at the forefront of any human rights conflict - which is as it should be if basic educational values are to be upheld. </p> <p>But what can be done? Well, quite a lot. China has detained three academics without trial. An international campaign of protest is under way led by the academic freedom committee of Human Rights Watch, the New York Academy of Sciences and the American Association for the Advancement of Science, while 400 international China studies scholars have sent a letter to President Jiang Zemin. China's cultural and academic links are at risk. The authorities there certainly would not realise the extent of the international concern if the world of education had remained silent. </p> <p>So how will the new network be organised?

      "bodyText": "In many parts of the world, university academics and students live in perpetual fear. The same is true for teachers in colleges and schools, and increasingly for pupils. For some, this is the reality of life in the first part of the 21st century. Killings, imprisonment, abuse and harassment are on the increase . This is the reason behind a new global watchdog, Network for Education and Academic Rights (Near). Inspired by a meeting called by Unesco early in 2000, it is being launched to aid the rapid transfer of information on a global basis. It will alert those able to take action to protest to governments and international agencies and will quickly inform the leaders of countries with the worst record that their actions are being closely watched by an international community. News about attacks on educational establishments do not often hit the headlines. How many of us have heard that recently in Ethiopia 49 people were killed in clashes, most of these linked to universities and schools? Amnesty International reported that security forces were using \"excessive force against students and other demonstrators\". According to Agence France-Presse (AFP), students and schoolchildren protested and police rounded up protesters, who were demanding greater freedom of expression. A statement from the Addis Ababa University Students Association posted on the net on April 23 said, \"We are in grave danger . . . we want the world to hear our side of the story . . . many students are seriously wounded and are being detained\". Over the last 10 years, university academics have either been forced to flee Ethiopia or been imprisoned. The BBC website shows the student dormitories splattered with blood. Near will provide a site where reports from many sources have been incorporated. Other examples can be found in Afghanistan, Indonesia, Burma, China, Malaysia, Belarus and Uzbekistan - just a small number of countries where those in education are at risk. In Afghanistan, academics were forced to flee from the Taliban regime. Many arrived in Pakistan where they faced further harassment and threats. Academics in Serbia continue to grapple with the legacy of Slobodan Milosevic's attempts to control the universities that served as centres of opposition to his government. The University Act of 1998 subjected faculty members to political oversight and deprived them of the right to select their administrators. As a result of this law Belgrade University alone lost some 180 instructors and professors. The dictator's measures backfired. Opposition to the University Act was one of the central demands of stu dents and academics protesting against the Milosevic government, with many university professors and members of the Serbian Academy of Science and Arts backing Otpor (\"Resistance\"), a loosely structured, student-led opposition movement that played a critical role in Milosevic's electoral defeat. One of the first moves of the new Serbian Minister of Education was to rescind the University Act. While Yugoslav universities now operate under the law as it was before 1998, they still have to deal with those academics who were sacked because of it. Although ministers have suggested a new law, the first drafts have been criticised as insufficiently protective of academic freedom. In the meantime, cases are being looked at individually. As well as these large-scale occurrences, there are countless situations of police detaining individuals who try to leave the country or those who are dismissed from their posts for expressing views opposing the ruling party. One academic was detained recently leaving a Middle East country because he was an outspoken advocate of human rights. He faced imprisonment because of remarks made at an international conference in which he criticised the country's human rights record. Some will say that others face the same risk from totalitarian regimes. Universities and schools, however, are often at the forefront of any human rights conflict - which is as it should be if basic educational values are to be upheld. But what can be done? Well, quite a lot. China has detained three academics without trial. An international campaign of protest is under way led by the academic freedom committee of Human Rights Watch, the New York Academy of Sciences and the American Association for the Advancement of Science, while 400 international China studies scholars have sent a letter to President Jiang Zemin. China's cultural and academic links are at risk. The authorities there certainly would not realise the extent of the international concern if the world of education had remained silent. So how will the new network be organised? Funded by Unesco - with other grants now being sought worldwide - its whole raison d' tre will be to assist those who already promote educational rights. It will work vigorously to improve information transfer among those best able to take action. Member organisations will be able to post alerts and other information on the Near website, which is now under construction. The network will, through the opportunities provided by the internet and other communication technologies, develop links with NGOs, trade unions, professional bodies, decision makers, educators and the general public making vital information aimed at defending freedom of expression available and accessible. Founding members of the network are the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Human Rights Watch, the Council for Assisting Refugee Academics, the Association of University Teachers, the worldwide teacher organisation Education International, the Scholars at Risk Network (University of Chicago) and the Council for the Development of Social Science Research in Africa. The new network's related organisation is the International Freedom of Expression Exchange (Ifex) with which it already has close links (www.ifex.org). Formed in 1992, with the support of Unesco, Ifex has transformed the global exchange of information about abuses against the rights of journalists. It now has in excess of 50 member organisations throughout the world, and its website receives more than 60,000 hits a week.

Links with Africa, Asia and South America will be a vital part of the network's development plan. Mary Robinson, the UN human rights commissioner, recently stated that universities, colleges and schools have a vital role to play in the development of human rights. The network will be working to ensure their rights are upheld. John Akker is the executive director of Near.

Professor Mikel Azurmendi, a social anthropologist at the University of Bilbao, was a member of the armed separatist group ETA until 1970, when he joined the Basque pro-democracy movement, and founded the Foro Ermua, one of the most prestigious intellectual groups advocating peace and democracy. An author of many books, his major contribution has been to deconstruct the \"ethnic exclusionism\" used by radi cal nationalists to define the Basque historical experience, and to criticise this ideology as one leading to intolerance. Azurmendi has reportedly been on an ETA hit list for some time. Appeals to kill him have been distributed in pamphlets; and he was the direct target of a bomb attack in August 2000 in San Sebastian.

      "body": "<p>For a government supposedly wedded to spin, Labour makes a pig's ear of selling genuinely good news. Childcare offers some. Look at the chart. Childminders are in decline (though 25% of children in paid care still go to them) but nurseries are booming, thanks to Labour. More places are in the pipeline. Enough is going on for the Daycare Trust to be thinking, not implausibly, of a childcare place for every working parent who wants one within a decade*. </p> <p>But its survey finds barely 25% of parents even know the government has a \"national childcare strategy\". One reason for childcare's low salience is fragmentation. This year the Department for Education and Employment is spending \u00a3202m on childcare but in 12 separate packages, \u00a33m for toy libraries, \u00a341m to help recruit childminders and so on. A full accounting of the public money available would also include bits of the separate \u00a3290m for providing nursery places for three- and four-year-olds in schools and the \u00a3450m children's fund giving grants to councils in poor areas. </p> <p>One reason so few parents have been shouting praise from the rooftops is administrative. In the past a major new service would have been announced with a big bang, like Lloyd George on pensions or Attlee and the health service. Labour will not do that partly because it is sensitive over accusations of centralisation, partly because it has not so far wanted to commit the huge sums necessary to create a new national service, at least not up front. An alternative might have been to force employers to do their bit. After all, productivity and profit depend on parents. Yet only 4% of them get any financial help with childcare from their firms and only 5% of companies provide a workplace nursery. </p> <p>Childcare falls between stools because the thrust of policy, so far, is redistributive - it has been about assisting lower income parents first. The \"national\" strategy is in fact sectional, with overlapping ambitions both for poorer people and the areas in which they live. The official target is a childcare place in the most disadvantaged areas for every lone parent entering employment by 2004. But the political cost of such a focus is the programme's invisibility and the non-participation of the middle classes. To realise the Daycare Trust's ambition of a \"universal coherent system based on a children's centre in every neighbourhood\" - with funding to match - is going to take middle-class involvement. More affluent parents are going to be needed both as activists and as voters to approve the large increases in public spending that would be necessary. </p> <p>We are some way off. The 725,000 places available last year serviced some 5m children under eight. The appetite for help with care is huge - children between eight and 11 could benefit mightily from an expansion of after-school-hours supervised activities. Some 58% of mothers with a child aged under five are at work and four out of 10 women of working age have dependent children. Health minister Yvette Cooper was extolling the government's maternity arrangements on these pages yesterday. But as more women return to work after maternity leave, shortfalls in childcare places become more apparent. </p> <p>Still, the number of economically active women whose youngest child is aged less than four rose from 48% to 58% over the decade to last year. Childcare places did expand under the Tories. But in many families it is granny and neighbours who paper over the cracks. Some 70% of work ing women with dependent children make \"informal arrangements\" for all or part of their childcare. Childcare outside the home is used by 13% of parents all the time and by a further 8% in combination with friends and family. </p> <p>Labour has wanted to expand employment as its principal anti-poverty measure. The working families' tax credit (WFTC) is part of the armoury and is meant to contribute to the cost of childcare. WFTC childcare averages \u00a333.48 a week, a long way short of the England average of \u00a388.87 for childminding, let alone the \u00a3110.49 for a nursery place. </p> <p>Meanwhile, in another neck of the woods, women ministers, notably Margaret Hodge and Tessa Jowell, with effective lobbying from former social security secretary Harriet Harman, have tried to expand the local supply of places. A total of 1.6m is promised by 2004 - meaning at the very least that the next three years are going to see terrific expansion of employment in this area. That must mean more training and better payment. </p> <p>It is at this point that the lack of \"strategy\" shows. Is state-supported childcare a welfare state graft, a new arm on an old body? Open acknowledgment that this is the expansion of collective provision would raise the political stakes but might improve chances of the money being found. Childcare helps families and probably children, too - getting children out of their homes is a key aim for the parallel Sure Start programme for the disadvantaged. </p> <p>There is only one subsidised childcare place for every 14 children under three who are living in poverty. But, paradoxically, the best way to provide for them might be to create children's centres in every neighbourhood. Childcare would get its missing political charge if state- sponsored nurseries catered for middle-class women who might be able to afford to pay but find the difficulties of combining parenthood and employment just as acute as poorer women. </p> <p>*Thinking Big: Childcare for All from Daycare Trust 0207 840 3350 </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:david.walker@theguardian.com\">david.walker@theguardian.com</a></p>",

Yet only 4% of them get any financial help with childcare from their firms and only 5% of companies provide a workplace nursery. Childcare falls between stools because the thrust of policy, so far, is redistributive - it has been about assisting lower income parents first. The \"national\" strategy is in fact sectional, with overlapping ambitions both for poorer people and the areas in which they live. The official target is a childcare place in the most disadvantaged areas for every lone parent entering employment by 2004. But the political cost of such a focus is the programme's invisibility and the non-participation of the middle classes. To realise the Daycare Trust's ambition of a \"universal coherent system based on a children's centre in every neighbourhood\" - with funding to match - is going to take middle-class involvement. More affluent parents are going to be needed both as activists and as voters to approve the large increases in public spending that would be necessary. We are some way off. The 725,000 places available last year serviced some 5m children under eight. The appetite for help with care is huge - children between eight and 11 could benefit mightily from an expansion of after-school-hours supervised activities. Some 58% of mothers with a child aged under five are at work and four out of 10 women of working age have dependent children. Health minister Yvette Cooper was extolling the government's maternity arrangements on these pages yesterday. But as more women return to work after maternity leave, shortfalls in childcare places become more apparent. Still, the number of economically active women whose youngest child is aged less than four rose from 48% to 58% over the decade to last year. Childcare places did expand under the Tories. But in many families it is granny and neighbours who paper over the cracks. Some 70% of work ing women with dependent children make \"informal arrangements\" for all or part of their childcare. Childcare outside the home is used by 13% of parents all the time and by a further 8% in combination with friends and family. Labour has wanted to expand employment as its principal anti-poverty measure. The working families' tax credit (WFTC) is part of the armoury and is meant to contribute to the cost of childcare. WFTC childcare averages \u00a333.48 a week, a long way short of the England average of \u00a388.87 for childminding, let alone the \u00a3110.49 for a nursery place. Meanwhile, in another neck of the woods, women ministers, notably Margaret Hodge and Tessa Jowell, with effective lobbying from former social security secretary Harriet Harman, have tried to expand the local supply of places. A total of 1.6m is promised by 2004 - meaning at the very least that the next three years are going to see terrific expansion of employment in this area. That must mean more training and better payment. It is at this point that the lack of \"strategy\" shows. Is state-supported childcare a welfare state graft, a new arm on an old body? Open acknowledgment that this is the expansion of collective provision would raise the political stakes but might improve chances of the money being found. Childcare helps families and probably children, too - getting children out of their homes is a key aim for the parallel Sure Start programme for the disadvantaged. There is only one subsidised childcare place for every 14 children under three who are living in poverty. But, paradoxically, the best way to provide for them might be to create children's centres in every neighbourhood. Childcare would get its missing political charge if state- sponsored nurseries catered for middle-class women who might be able to afford to pay but find the difficulties of combining parenthood and employment just as acute as poorer women. *Thinking Big: Childcare for All from Daycare Trust 0207 840 3350 david.walker@theguardian.com",

      "body": "<p>Students organisations have been scared away from today's May Day protests in London because of media coverage and political statements, notably Ken Livingstone's on Friday, which have suggested the demonstration will be violent and confrontational.</p> <p>In previous years, large numbers of students took part in the anti-capitalism protests. This is still likely to be the case this year, as individual students around the country have been gearing up for the event, but it is clear that organised student groups have been hesitant about getting involved.</p> <p>Legally, unions cannot use their funding for issues that do not directly affect students. But union officials are usually informally involved with organising student events. Hugh Johnson, campaigns officer at Sussex University, is helping to organise a May Day protest, but not in his official role.</p> <p>However, he is not campaigning in London. \"What the government and media have been saying is actually more likely to make London's May Day violent, because that's what people will be expecting. So we\u00eare going to have a demonstration in Brighton outside a multinational company.\"</p> <p>Matt Coakley, president of Cambridge\u00eas student union, agreed that organisations are wary of getting involved, and that predictions of violence have influenced that decision.</p> <p>However, Owain James, president of the National Union of Students (NUS), said there is a bigger issue at stake. Although he supports environmental issues and believes many of the protestors in London are acting in good faith, \"I don't think the protests take the issues forward. They need to engage the public, but incidents like the one at the cenotaph put off most of society.\"</p> <p>It is not just the unions that are worried. Individual students have also voiced their concern. Seasoned protestor Tom Greaves, of Warwick University, is reconsidering his involvement.</p> <p>\"I'm getting so angry. It's incredible the stuff that's getting printed. But it has made me a bit worried. I was in that crush a couple of years ago where a police officer ran over a woman, and knew I didn\u00eat want to be in those scenes again. But then I decided to see what was going on for myself,\" he said.</p> <p>Like Hugh Johnson at Sussex, he has organised his own agenda for the day.

      "bodyText": "Students organisations have been scared away from today's May Day protests in London because of media coverage and political statements, notably Ken Livingstone's on Friday, which have suggested the demonstration will be violent and confrontational. In previous years, large numbers of students took part in the anti-capitalism protests. This is still likely to be the case this year, as individual students around the country have been gearing up for the event, but it is clear that organised student groups have been hesitant about getting involved. Legally, unions cannot use their funding for issues that do not directly affect students. But union officials are usually informally involved with organising student events. Hugh Johnson, campaigns officer at Sussex University, is helping to organise a May Day protest, but not in his official role. However, he is not campaigning in London. \"What the government and media have been saying is actually more likely to make London's May Day violent, because that's what people will be expecting. So we\u00eare going to have a demonstration in Brighton outside a multinational company.\" Matt Coakley, president of Cambridge\u00eas student union, agreed that organisations are wary of getting involved, and that predictions of violence have influenced that decision. However, Owain James, president of the National Union of Students (NUS), said there is a bigger issue at stake. Although he supports environmental issues and believes many of the protestors in London are acting in good faith, \"I don't think the protests take the issues forward. They need to engage the public, but incidents like the one at the cenotaph put off most of society.\" It is not just the unions that are worried. Individual students have also voiced their concern. Seasoned protestor Tom Greaves, of Warwick University, is reconsidering his involvement. \"I'm getting so angry. It's incredible the stuff that's getting printed. But it has made me a bit worried. I was in that crush a couple of years ago where a police officer ran over a woman, and knew I didn\u00eat want to be in those scenes again. But then I decided to see what was going on for myself,\" he said. Like Hugh Johnson at Sussex, he has organised his own agenda for the day. The May Day organisers have encouraged autonomous protests, and Mr Johnson and his friends will be protesting peacefully outside a Brighton company involved with oil exploitation in West Papua. Having decided to be in London, though, Mr Greaves will be at the main rally in Oxford Street at 4pm, where everyone will discover how accurate the predictions of violence have been.",

      "body": "<p>Boeing, the world's largest aircraft manufacturer, is a company in crisis, painfully embarking on the slow process of transforming a business which has more to offer than just history-making aircraft.</p> <p>This past week, at its Seattle headquarters, Boeing has gone to considerable lengths to show that all is right with the company and that the future beckons brightly. </p> <p>With Blairite echoes, Phil Condit, the planemaker's chief executive, refers to his organisation as \"New Boeing\" in an attempt to demonstrate that a fitter, leaner company will make strides in areas where it had faltered. </p> <p>The company has just published its quarterly report, showing that Boeing made a profit of \u00a3540m, a good starting point. </p> <p>But it is involved in a rationalisation programme which it has been forced to implement because of the relentless competition from Airbus, its buoyant European competitor in the commercial airliner market. </p> <p>From a position of complacency over the past five years, Boeing has finally admitted that Airbus has bitten deep into its financial skin and that it must repair the damage. </p> <p><strong> End of the affair</strong><br> </p> <p>Mr Condit claims that while Boeing holds 60% of the commercial market today, that could sink to less than 50% over the next few years, a figure Airbus already claims to have relegated its US rival to several times already. \"Yes, I have to admit that commercial will amount to a lesser percentage of our company, but we are certainly not going to shrink it.\" </p> <p>The company has also had to admit that it must finally part company with Seattle as its corporate headquarters. The city has long been associated with Boeing's remarkable success in civil aviation, where a long line of proud and profitable large airliners has been built, culminating in the 747, one of the most popular and safest aircraft ever to be manufactured. </p> <p>Mr Condit and his colleagues now feel that Seattle and Boeing must end their love affair, with corporate headquarters moving to a more anonymous location such as Chicago or Denver. Final decisions will be made over the next few months, with Chicago the pundits' favourite. </p> <p>Mr Condit does not blink when he utters the words \"leaner enterprise\", which in the minds of most people is synonymous with a reduction in staff. Neither the staff nor the unions appear to be restless, although the city of Seattle itself is extremely unhappy and is toiling to prevent the departure, to the extent of offering the company belated but generous tax concessions. </p> <p>A \"leaner enterprise\" does not mean to Mr Conditwhat many might fear. It means a 15% growth in the company this year, without any reduction in staff. \"The goal is to continue to expand, but to become leaner.\" </p> <p>The immediate course for Boeing is to try to trump Airbus. If the European consortium can build the A380, the world's largest superjumbo, able to carry upwards of 555 passengers, then Boeing is prepared to develop the world's fastest \"sonic airliner\", a trim double delta winged craft with a speed of 750mph. </p> <p>Boeing's \u00a36bn project makes it possible for such an aircraft to fly non-stop between London and Sydney in 18 hours, knocking four hours off the existing flight time, Mike Bair, Boeing's marketing director, said yesterday. </p> <p>Mr Bair said that deals might be signed with several leading American airlines over the next 12 months which would enable the first \"sonic cruiser\" to fly by 2006. Coincidentally, this is the year when Airbus plans to roll out its first A380. </p> <p>But Airbus is further down the commercial runway. While the Americans have scoffed at the concept of a superjumbo, Airbus has secured firm orders for 60 A380s and the first will start construction next year. </p> <p>Boeing's project has been greeted with a mixture of scepticism and excitement in the industry. Critics are unconvinced that Boeing can commercially outsmart its main rival whose senior executives pri vately scoff at the technical and commercial feasibility of the \"sonic cruiser\". </p> <p>Mr Bair said the new aircraft would open up \"entirely new routes for a non-stop faster service\". But he conceded that much had to be done before the project could take off. The success of the cruiser rested on talks with airlines - Boeing has only been taking the idea seriously for the past five months - \"and they will decide what they want and we will have to decide whether we can adapt to their ideas\". </p> <p><strong> Spoiling operation</strong><br> </p> <p>Mr Bair rejected the idea that a flight ceiling of 45,000 ft would expose it to cosmic radiation and a heightened risk of cabin decompression. Potential buyers are bothered about such matters, although executives such as Maurice Flanagan, managing director of Emirates, are more concerned about whether the aircraft's fuel burn would lead to higher fuel prices. </p> <p>Mr Flanagan and other airline chief executives have received only three spread sheets from Boeing and are unhappy about the paucity of information. If Boeing is to outmanoeuvre Airbus, it will have to hurry. Nobody in the business sees Boeing able to achieve this spoiling operation before 2006, with 2010 as the earliest in-service date. </p> <p>If Boeing is to become the truly global aerospace company to which Mr Condit and his colleagues aspire, it will have to place much more emphasis on its other activities. </p> <p>Mr Condit concedes that it has faced a setback in its \"traditional military and space markets\", and that to achieve new business and higher earnings it must reduce costs faster than its competition. \"At the same time, we must recognise that parts of our traditional business are maturing\" - another way of suggesting that the company is out of date in many areas. </p> <p>Boeing intends focusing just as strongly on its space and communications achievements and its missiles systems, which are thriving. It is about to launch its sixth satellite as part of its Sea Launch programme, an alliance with the Russians, Ukrainians, and Norwegians. </p> <p>Other parts of its \"new\" empire have yet to be tested. It has the skill and technology to run an efficient system of air traffic management, but this means breaking down national government barriers. It can turn your aircraft seat into a virtual office with superfast internet access, but is still awaiting takers. </p> <p>Boeing is at a crossroads and uncertain of its direction. Being a large company it has an immense capacity to adjust. But the most poignant revelation of the past week is that Boeing now has its own real estate company. This is busy selling off tracts of its base at Long Beach, California, home of the 717 short hop jet, for a lucrative property development.</p>",

Mr Condit does not blink when he utters the words \"leaner enterprise\", which in the minds of most people is synonymous with a reduction in staff. Neither the staff nor the unions appear to be restless, although the city of Seattle itself is extremely unhappy and is toiling to prevent the departure, to the extent of offering the company belated but generous tax concessions. A \"leaner enterprise\" does not mean to Mr Conditwhat many might fear. It means a 15% growth in the company this year, without any reduction in staff. \"The goal is to continue to expand, but to become leaner.\" The immediate course for Boeing is to try to trump Airbus. If the European consortium can build the A380, the world's largest superjumbo, able to carry upwards of 555 passengers, then Boeing is prepared to develop the world's fastest \"sonic airliner\", a trim double delta winged craft with a speed of 750mph. Boeing's \u00a36bn project makes it possible for such an aircraft to fly non-stop between London and Sydney in 18 hours, knocking four hours off the existing flight time, Mike Bair, Boeing's marketing director, said yesterday. Mr Bair said that deals might be signed with several leading American airlines over the next 12 months which would enable the first \"sonic cruiser\" to fly by 2006. Coincidentally, this is the year when Airbus plans to roll out its first A380. But Airbus is further down the commercial runway. While the Americans have scoffed at the concept of a superjumbo, Airbus has secured firm orders for 60 A380s and the first will start construction next year. Boeing's project has been greeted with a mixture of scepticism and excitement in the industry. Critics are unconvinced that Boeing can commercially outsmart its main rival whose senior executives pri vately scoff at the technical and commercial feasibility of the \"sonic cruiser\". Mr Bair said the new aircraft would open up \"entirely new routes for a non-stop faster service\". But he conceded that much had to be done before the project could take off. The success of the cruiser rested on talks with airlines - Boeing has only been taking the idea seriously for the past five months - \"and they will decide what they want and we will have to decide whether we can adapt to their ideas\". Spoiling operation Mr Bair rejected the idea that a flight ceiling of 45,000 ft would expose it to cosmic radiation and a heightened risk of cabin decompression. Potential buyers are bothered about such matters, although executives such as Maurice Flanagan, managing director of Emirates, are more concerned about whether the aircraft's fuel burn would lead to higher fuel prices. Mr Flanagan and other airline chief executives have received only three spread sheets from Boeing and are unhappy about the paucity of information. If Boeing is to outmanoeuvre Airbus, it will have to hurry. Nobody in the business sees Boeing able to achieve this spoiling operation before 2006, with 2010 as the earliest in-service date. If Boeing is to become the truly global aerospace company to which Mr Condit and his colleagues aspire, it will have to place much more emphasis on its other activities. Mr Condit concedes that it has faced a setback in its \"traditional military and space markets\", and that to achieve new business and higher earnings it must reduce costs faster than its competition. \"At the same time, we must recognise that parts of our traditional business are maturing\" - another way of suggesting that the company is out of date in many areas. Boeing intends focusing just as strongly on its space and communications achievements and its missiles systems, which are thriving. It is about to launch its sixth satellite as part of its Sea Launch programme, an alliance with the Russians, Ukrainians, and Norwegians. Other parts of its \"new\" empire have yet to be tested. It has the skill and technology to run an efficient system of air traffic management, but this means breaking down national government barriers. It can turn your aircraft seat into a virtual office with superfast internet access, but is still awaiting takers. Boeing is at a crossroads and uncertain of its direction. Being a large company it has an immense capacity to adjust. But the most poignant revelation of the past week is that Boeing now has its own real estate company. This is busy selling off tracts of its base at Long Beach, California, home of the 717 short hop jet, for a lucrative property development.",

      "bodyText": "A leading mental health scholar in New Zealand has been accused of killing his wife by administering a lethal cocktail of hypoglycemic drugs to her over a three-month period until her death last year on January 5. The preliminary hearing of a murder charge against Colin D Bouwer, who at the time of his wife's death was the head of the department of psychological medicine at the University of Otago, in the southern township of Dunedin, is currently in its third week at the city's district court. The case is the second involving a university lecturer in recent years to have come before the New Zealand courts, and one of a growing number worldwide involving mental health specialists accused of killing their spouses or colleagues, including the manslaughter conviction handed down in London last September in the case of Steven Reid, a psychology lecturer at the University of Westminster who battered to death a female researcher at the institution. The prosecution has alleged that the South African-born Dr Bouwer began prescribing the drugs for Annette Bouwer, 47, after he embarked upon an ill-starred sexual affair with a colleague during an international medical conference in Copenhagen. Both the name of the other woman and details about her occupation have been suppressed by the court. It was alleged that Dr Bouwer gave his wife drugs designed to promote insulin secretion, and that the resultant abnormal lowering of her blood glucose levels led to her being admitted to hospital in a hypoglycemic coma. Believing that her condition stemmed from a pancreatic tumour, or insulinoma, Ms Bouwer subsequently underwent surgery to have two-thirds of her pancreas removed - although no traces of any malignancy were found at the time of her operation or in tissue tests conducted after her unexpected death less than a fortnight later. Her death came as \"a complete shock\" to medical staff who had treated her during the preceding weeks, the court was told by a nurse late last week. Sarah Romans, a professor of psychology at the university, told the court yesterday that Ms Bouwer had said shortly before her death that she had been the victim of foul play, possibly at the hand of a family member. Dr Bouwer has claimed that he is innocent of any wrongdoing. In a bizarre but unrelated coincidence, the court also heard that Dr Bouwer's son, who shares his father's name, is currently on trial for the murder of his own wife, in their Kempton Park home in Johannesburg. Of more immediate interest to watching academics, however, were the similarities between aspects of the New Zealand case and another local trial held five years ago in nearby Christchurch, in which a molecular biologist from the University of Canterbury's department of plant and microbial sciences was accused of administering a near-fatal dose of a neurotoxin to a botanist colleague who had broken off a relationship with her for another academic. The \"Unapoisoner\" trial, as the earlier case was dubbed in some quarters, transfixed the New Zealand public, all the more so because of its parade of often traumatised faculty members testifying for and against the accused, Victoria Calder, who was later acquitted of attempting to murder David Lloyd. Although the case has been closely followed in academic circles, New Zealand law forbids any public comment on the proceedings of a criminal trial or depositions hearing. Even it is found that he has no case to answer for, it is unlikely that Dr Bouwer will again find work at the University of Otago. During the police investigation that led to his arrest, it was discovered that he had previously been suspended from practising medicine in his native South Africa in 1981, as a result of pethidine abuse.",

The group has consistently fallen foul of EU competition regulators and shareholders. Watchdogs have ordered EMI to shed its Virgin subsidiary in order to let a deal through. However, the shareholders do not want the group's value diminished by a deal. Related stories 01.05.2001: EMI calls off \u00a310bn BMG merger 01.05.2001: EMI merger with BMG stumbles",

      "body": "<b>Germany</b> <br> Police battled hundreds of violent May Day protesters in Berlin, using water cannon to break up burning street blockades and arresting several dozen leftists. Far-right marchers took to the streets later in the day, kept apart from counter-demonstrators by police. Even with 9,000 police in the streets, the violence dented the city's hopes of ending an annual ritual of violence that officials view as undignified for Germany's revived capital. <p><b>France</b><br> Thousands of workers and trade unionists took to the streets across France on Tuesday to celebrate May Day but also to protest against recent layoffs. Pride of place at the head of the marches was given to those affected by a recent wave of restructuring in companies, including food giant Groupe Danone SA and Marks &amp; Spencer. Many M&amp;S former employees wore black t-shirts carrying the words, \"I was one of 4,000 employees made redundant by e-mail.\" Marches were due to be held in around 70 French towns and cities. </p> <p><b>Ukraine</b><br> Around 1,000 Communists rallied in Kiev against President Leonid Kuchma, whom they blame for creating miserable conditions in the former Soviet country. To the sound of Soviet anthems, the procession slowly wound its way through the city centre, bearing red Communist flags, portraits of Lenin and banners proclaiming: \"All power to the workers\" and \"Out with the bourgeoisie.\" The protesters, mainly pensioners nostalgic about life under Soviet rule, did not mince their words in reference to their leaders. \"They should all be hanged, Kuchma and company,\" said Lidia, a 75-year-old protester.</p> <p><b>Indonesia</b><br> Thousands of workers staged mostly peaceful rallies in major cities across Indonesia to demand greater freedom to organise, an end to arbitrary layoffs and that May Day be declared an official public holiday. At one rally in Bandung, the capital of West Java, hundreds of protesting workers clashed with police and several were injured. More than 1,000 workers marched to Monas square in central Jakarta, urging the government to declare May 1 as Indonesia's labour day. Some of the protestors staged dances and marching band performances.</p> <p><b>Iran</b><br> Several thousand Iranian factory workers staged a peaceful rally outside parliament. \"We have come before the house of the people to attract the attention of government officials to our problems,\" said a worker from a factory close to Tehran. The workers listened to speeches from reformist MP Elias Hazrati and a workers' representative Ali-Reza Mahjub. The workers urged the authorities to take measures to solve their problems. \"We are asking the authorities to pay more attention to our problems such as the presence of foreign labour force and temporary working contracts\", a statement read.</p> <p><b>Greece</b><br> More than 10,000 people joined a march through central Athens, but many Greeks used the holiday to go to the country. Trades unions held two separate demonstrations in the capital and later formed a single march to parliament. Similar demonstrations were held around the country. \"We win our rights through struggle,\" workers chanted as they waved red banners and flags. Unions took advantage of the rallies to protest a decision by the Socialist government to overhaul the country's nearly bankrupt pension system.</p> <p><b>Korea</b><br> North and South Korean workers sang and danced together in their first joint celebration of May Day. Some 1,000 workers from the two Koreas observed May Day at Diamond Mountain, a scenic North Korean resort area. The festivities were the first of their kind since the division of the Korean peninsula in 1945. In Seoul, 10,000 workers and students beating gongs and drums marched under a large banner reading: \"Down with (President) Kim Dae-jung, who ruined workers' lives.\" During a separate march in Seoul, 3,000 workers cheered while protesters set fire to a coffin symbolising the government's economic reforms that have resulted in layoffs</p> <p><b>Australia</b><br> In Sydney, hundreds of anti-globalisation protesters fought with riot police. Two police were hospitalised and 28 protesters injured as police detained 30 demonstrators. In Brisbane, about 35 activists were arrested and several people injured as protesters tried to storm the stock exchange. Protesters in Melbourne briefly threatened to storm a McDonald's restaurant and sprayed it with slogans in front of cheering onlookers.</p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/story/0,7369,481319,00.html\">1.05.2001: First arrests as May Day protests begins</a><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/story/0,7369,481407,00.html\">01.05.2001: May Day mood begins to darken</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/story/0,7369,480988,00.html\">1.05.2001, comment: Politics not parliament</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/story/0,7369,481222,00.html\">1.05.2001: Blair attacks \u00a5spurious\u0090 May Day protest</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/story/0,7369,481125,00.html\">1.05.2001: Confusion reigns as police brace for mayhem</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/story/0,7369,481096,00.html\">1.05.2001, comment: Violence is our enemy</a></p> <p><b>The London May Day protests at a glance</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/story/0,7369,481318,00.html\">Minute-by-minute coverage of the demonstrations</a></p> <p><b>Picture gallery</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/gall/0,8542,481316,00.html\">Pictures of today's protests</a></p> <p><b>Interactive guide</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/flash/0,7365,477858,00.html \">Interactive guide to global protests </a><br></p> <p><b>Map of London</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/graphic/0,7367,480993,00.html\">What\u0090s happened so far</a></p> <p><b>The issue explained </b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theissues/article/0,6512,479726,00.html\"> The May Day protests</a></p> <p><b>Talk about it</b><br> <a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee81d50/0\">What do you think?</a></p> <p><b>Special reports</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/\">May Day 2001 </a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/globalisation/ \">Globalisation </a></p> <p><b>Net notes</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/netnotes/article/0,6729,214862,00.html \">May Day protests - the story in links</a></p> <p><b>Quiz</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/quiz/questions/0,5961,480911,00.html\">What kind of May Day protester are you?</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b> <br><a href=\"http://www.maydaymonopoly.net/\" target=\"_new\">May Day Monopoly </a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.urban75.com/\" target=\"_new\">Urban 75 </a> <br> <a href=\"http://www.wombleaction.mrnice.net/\" target=\"_new\">Womble Action </a> <br><a href=\"http://uk.indymedia.org/\" target=\"_NEW\">Independent Media Centre</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.critical-mass.org/\" target=\"_NEW\">Critical Mass</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.reclaimthestreets.net/\" target=\"_NEW\">Reclaim the Streets</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.london.gov.uk/\" target=\"_NEW\">Greater London Assembly</a> <br><a href=\"http://www.met.police.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Metropolitan police </a></p>",

      "bodyText": "The Conservative party tonight moved to close ranks over the damaging race issue which has seen two of its MPs forced to apologise for their views. The black Tory peer, Lord Taylor of Warwick, who had strongly criticised William Hague's handling of the affair, has now told the party he is happy the situation has been resolved. His move comes after Tewkesbury MP Laurence Robertson apologised for backing the Yorkshire East MP John Townend's controversial remarks on immigration. Lord Taylor, who had been linked with possible defections to both Labour and the Liberal Democrats after his earlier comments on Mr Hague's leadership, said tonight: \"I have made my point and am not currently planning to take the matter further.\" Lord Taylor said he had achieved his goal in getting the party to make clear its commitment to a vision of Britain where racial intolerance and bigotry were \"totally unacceptable\". Mr Robertson was today forced to apologise for endorsing Mr Townend's stand, and retracted his own remarks after a 10 minute grilling from the party's whips. They threatened to expel him from the party if he did not back down. Last night Mr Robertson defied the leadership to appear on television condoning Mr Townend's opinions, and adding that \"cramming\" different racial groups together was making society difficult to manage. Today Mr Robertson said: \"I apologise for saying that John Townend's comments were right, and I retract my own comments to that effect. \"I undertake not to cause further embarrassment to the Conservative Party, nor to give further offence to others... nor will I repeat my remarks under any circumstances.\" Meanwhile, a Tory spokesman said the party had \"no quarrel\" with remarks on the issue made earlier today by veteran rightwinger Lord Tebbit. The peer said he did not know of any \"happy multicultural society\". And the shadow chancellor, Michael Portillo, earlier today rejected claims that William Hague acted too late in the row over racism that has dominated coverage of the party. At a press conference in Scotland, Mr Portillo claimed that by bringing MP John Townend to account over controversial remarks, the Tory leader had shown firm and effective action and had defined the party's stance against racism. Mr Portillo was speaking in Edinburgh at an event where his central message - an attack on Labour over the economy - was overshadowed by the row over race. Mr Portillo added: \"It has led to an opportunity in the end to define ourselves, to make clear we will not tolerate racism or inflammatory language and anyone who transgresses that will be dealt with.\" Mr Portillo also said he hoped Lord Taylor, the black Tory peer who led demands for Mr Townend's expulsion following his remarks, would recognise the depth of Mr Townend's apology.

      "body": "<p>One of the more enduring mysteries of the 2001 general election/Tory leadership campaign is likely to prove to be William Hague's reluctance to expel the far right Tory MP, John Townend, over his warning that immigration was creating \"a mongrel race\".</p> <p>For the political party which has held the western European record for winning elections over the past 130 years, it seemed such an obvious political howler. Hague showed no qualms last month about throwing the pro-Fayed MP, Charles Wardle, out of the party. Nor did Heath show any such hesitation in sacking Enoch Powell in 1968 from the shadow cabinet after making his infamous \"rivers of blood\" immigration remarks.</p> <p>Much speculation has already centred on the idea that Hague's refusal to con front his own racist right has been part of a deliberately cynical decision to shore up what remains of the core Tory vote. Conservative candidates have never commanded more than negligible support among black and Asian voters - only 11% voted Tory in 1997 and even among their strongest supporters, the Indian community, they took only 18% of the votes.</p> <p>On this theory, Hague has made a cold calculation that the electoral arithmetic favours keeping Townend in the party while presenting the defection of the black Tory peer, John Taylor, as merely some kind of well orchestrated Labour plot to maximise Conservative discomfort.</p> <p>But this explanation falls down when you consider that not even Hague's brand of \"skinhead Conservatism\" contains an avowedly racist agenda. He is not some kind of closet racist.</p> <p>So what about an alternative explanation? As the decision day for a May or June election approached, Central Office strategists sat down and had a long hard look at all their political polling data. Despite the foot and mouth crisis they have failed to make any headway since the petrol protests last autumn. Their share of the vote has flatlined at about 33-34% leaving Tony Blair heading straight for another 100-plus Commons majority.</p> <p>The only ray of hope that the figures have offered is on the single issue of asylum and immigration. While Labour has commanding poll leads on all the other big questions that voters say they care about - health, schools, crime, the economy - asylum is the only issue that appears to be a vote winner rather than a vote loser. None of the traditional opposition party tactics seems to be doing the trick. The old tunes of Time For A Change and Labour Isn't Working don't seem to provoke the kind of mass singalong among the voters that they once enjoyed.</p> <p>In this desperate situation that one shaft of light (the polling lead on asylum) takes on an importance out of all proportion to the other concerns of the average voter. For the Tories it becomes something like football's \"golden goal in extra time\", some kind of totem by which they can magically win the whole election if they win on that one issue.</p> <p>Asylum also had the advantage over Europe in being an issue on which the party did not immediately start to tear itself apart as soon as Hague opened his mouth. Whenever Europe is debated in Tory circles those who want to leave the EU soon make their voices heard. At least until now there was a line in the sand within the party which divided a harsh policy on asylum from a more tolerant position on race and community relations.</p> <p>Labour is partly to blame, for the way it has fought the asylum debate has only encouraged them. It is rather as though Blair's team is six goals up with 10 minutes to go. Instead of leaving it alone they are so determined to get that seventh goal with the result that they let the Tories score one in the final minute. The Tories get a consolation goal and claim a moral victory. Hague keeps Blair's majority below 100 and lives to fight another day.</p> <p>That, at least, is the way some inside Conservative Central Office saw the way the election might unfold. Hague made his now famous \"foreign country\" speech in which he promised \"elect a Conservative government and we will give you back your country\".</p> <p>But the row over the commission for racial equality's anti-racist pledge smoked out Townend. Then Hague's closest rival for the leadership, Ann Widdecombe, successfully sidestepped the whole issue by saying she had signed it but thought it \"silly\" thus avoiding alienating either wing of her party.</p> <p>Hague failed to close down the row. He knows that to make real inroads into the Labour vote he has to drive the party back to the centre-left of British politics. The problem lies in the fact that some parts of the Tory party do not know the difference between asylum and race. Discussion of asylum soon turned to calls for the abolition of the CRE. The left of the Tory party - stronger on race than on Europe - fought back and the hoped for surge in the polls turned to an alarming drop in Hague's own standing, as Tory voters took fright at the sight of a party out of control.</p> <p>Hague's weak threat to Townend yesterday - no more than a warning - is really little more than another day of vacillation and humiliation in his own campaign diary.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:alan.travis@theguardian.com\">alan.travis@theguardian.com</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b> <br><a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/conservatives/story/0,9061,479358,00.html\">27.04.2001: New race speech blow to Hague</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/racism/Story/0,2763,479241,00.html\">27.04.2001: Athlete tells how 'race campaign' hit gold hopes</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/racism/Story/0,2763,479360,00.html\">27.04.2001: No manslaughter trial for police five</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/racism/Story/0,2763,479171,00.html\">27.04.2001: Attack on pensioner 'was not racist'</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.cre.gov.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Commission for Racial Equality</a><br><a href=\"http://www.homebeats.co.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Institute of Race Relations</a><br><a href=\"http://www.blink.org.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Black nformation link (BLINK)</a><br><a href=\"http://www.carf.demon.co.uk/index.html\" target=\"_new\">Campaign Against Racism and Fascism (CARF)</a><br><a href=\"http://www.ercomer.org/\" target=\"_new\">European Centre on migration and ethnic relations</a><br><a href=\"http://aar.vrx.net/\" target=\"_new\">Artists against racism</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "One of the more enduring mysteries of the 2001 general election/Tory leadership campaign is likely to prove to be William Hague's reluctance to expel the far right Tory MP, John Townend, over his warning that immigration was creating \"a mongrel race\". For the political party which has held the western European record for winning elections over the past 130 years, it seemed such an obvious political howler. Hague showed no qualms last month about throwing the pro-Fayed MP, Charles Wardle, out of the party. Nor did Heath show any such hesitation in sacking Enoch Powell in 1968 from the shadow cabinet after making his infamous \"rivers of blood\" immigration remarks. Much speculation has already centred on the idea that Hague's refusal to con front his own racist right has been part of a deliberately cynical decision to shore up what remains of the core Tory vote. Conservative candidates have never commanded more than negligible support among black and Asian voters - only 11% voted Tory in 1997 and even among their strongest supporters, the Indian community, they took only 18% of the votes. On this theory, Hague has made a cold calculation that the electoral arithmetic favours keeping Townend in the party while presenting the defection of the black Tory peer, John Taylor, as merely some kind of well orchestrated Labour plot to maximise Conservative discomfort. But this explanation falls down when you consider that not even Hague's brand of \"skinhead Conservatism\" contains an avowedly racist agenda. He is not some kind of closet racist. So what about an alternative explanation? As the decision day for a May or June election approached, Central Office strategists sat down and had a long hard look at all their political polling data. Despite the foot and mouth crisis they have failed to make any headway since the petrol protests last autumn. Their share of the vote has flatlined at about 33-34% leaving Tony Blair heading straight for another 100-plus Commons majority. The only ray of hope that the figures have offered is on the single issue of asylum and immigration. While Labour has commanding poll leads on all the other big questions that voters say they care about - health, schools, crime, the economy - asylum is the only issue that appears to be a vote winner rather than a vote loser. None of the traditional opposition party tactics seems to be doing the trick. The old tunes of Time For A Change and Labour Isn't Working don't seem to provoke the kind of mass singalong among the voters that they once enjoyed. In this desperate situation that one shaft of light (the polling lead on asylum) takes on an importance out of all proportion to the other concerns of the average voter. For the Tories it becomes something like football's \"golden goal in extra time\", some kind of totem by which they can magically win the whole election if they win on that one issue. Asylum also had the advantage over Europe in being an issue on which the party did not immediately start to tear itself apart as soon as Hague opened his mouth. Whenever Europe is debated in Tory circles those who want to leave the EU soon make their voices heard. At least until now there was a line in the sand within the party which divided a harsh policy on asylum from a more tolerant position on race and community relations. Labour is partly to blame, for the way it has fought the asylum debate has only encouraged them. It is rather as though Blair's team is six goals up with 10 minutes to go. Instead of leaving it alone they are so determined to get that seventh goal with the result that they let the Tories score one in the final minute. The Tories get a consolation goal and claim a moral victory. Hague keeps Blair's majority below 100 and lives to fight another day. That, at least, is the way some inside Conservative Central Office saw the way the election might unfold. Hague made his now famous \"foreign country\" speech in which he promised \"elect a Conservative government and we will give you back your country\". But the row over the commission for racial equality's anti-racist pledge smoked out Townend. Then Hague's closest rival for the leadership, Ann Widdecombe, successfully sidestepped the whole issue by saying she had signed it but thought it \"silly\" thus avoiding alienating either wing of her party. Hague failed to close down the row. He knows that to make real inroads into the Labour vote he has to drive the party back to the centre-left of British politics. The problem lies in the fact that some parts of the Tory party do not know the difference between asylum and race. Discussion of asylum soon turned to calls for the abolition of the CRE. The left of the Tory party - stronger on race than on Europe - fought back and the hoped for surge in the polls turned to an alarming drop in Hague's own standing, as Tory voters took fright at the sight of a party out of control. Hague's weak threat to Townend yesterday - no more than a warning - is really little more than another day of vacillation and humiliation in his own campaign diary. alan.travis@theguardian.com Related articles 27.04.2001: New race speech blow to Hague 27.04.2001: Athlete tells how 'race campaign' hit gold hopes 27.04.2001: No manslaughter trial for police five 27.04.2001: Attack on pensioner 'was not racist' Useful links Commission for Racial Equality Institute of Race Relations Black nformation link (BLINK) Campaign Against Racism and Fascism (CARF) European Centre on migration and ethnic relations Artists against racism",

But the local party made it clear they were not happy with the idea of a black MP: Taylor was called a \"bloody nigger\" by one Tory activist, and some supporters defected. The Lib Dems won. Some decent Tories privately conceded that Taylor had not worked the patch hard enough. He is not a hyperactive peer (John Major ennobled him in 1996), - \"not there in the heat of debate,\" as one Lib Dem noted.

Accordingly, I withdraw the recent words which I have issued on the subject of race, apologise for the embarrassment which they have caused the Conservative party, regret any offence which I have caused to others and undertake not to repeat them under any circumstances. Tory candidates and MEPs Coming from many different ethnic backgrounds, we are Conservatives because we believe in Conservative principles and policies. We believe that the Conservative party is an open and tolerant party which values the rich variety of our multicultural society today.

      "body": "<p><strong>SHORT HAIR, BIG CUP</strong></p> <p>In recent weeks, Steve McManaman has trimmed his trademark shaggy locks for a suspiciously mid-west-looking mullet. But don't worry: the care-free Scouser isn't about to starting foolin' around with his cousin or plannin' to buy a pick-up truck. He's got better things on his mind. Namely having a pop at Manchester United. Again. \"United suffered this season because they never sorted out a proper game-plan in Europe,\" claimed Macca through crocodile tears today. \"When you look at United's results in Europe all season, you could say as soon as they came up against a decent side they would struggle. I know most of the lads at Madrid wanted United in the semi-final, because they felt it would be the easier tie.\"</p> <p>Unfortunately for Macca (providing he shakes off an ankle injury) and Madrid, they face a much tougher Big Cup proposition tonight: Bayern Munich. The \"confident\" Germans, as Clive Tyldesley so delicately puts it, will no doubt be buoyed by hearing that Giovane Elber and Jens Jeremies are both likely to be fit despite having knee surgery little more than a week ago. \"My knee is fine and I am on fire for the match against Real,\" Elber said. \"Now it's up to the coach to decide whether I'll start or not.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, according to Spanish paper Marca, Valencia coach Hector Cuper is preparing his defenders to face Leeds by encouraging them to mimic \"the illegal play typical of dirty British defenders\" in training sessions. Just in case you're wondering, that includes giving license to \"elbow, knee, push and shove\" John Carew, Juan Sanchez and Pablo Aimar in preparation for tomorrow's match against Leeds. The paper also picks out two unlikely hardmen that Valencia need to look out for: Dominic Matteo and Rio Ferdinand. \"Matteo is one of the toughest players in the Premiership,\" the paper claims, \"and Ferdinand's aggression on the pitch is as noteworthy as his \u00a318m transfer fee.\" Yeah, and Alan Smith's a little angel too.</p> <p><strong>HURL-Y BURLEY</strong></p> <p>The Fiver has always said that Ipswich are rubbish. That kit, that funny pair of lips on Richard Wright, that sweet, flowing football that has mesmerised defences all across the country - Joe Pasquale, the lot of it. So when those crazy Scythe-wielding Boys announced today that they've given joker George Burley a new five-year contract expected to earn him \u00a3500,000 a year, we weren't surprised. Oh no. After all, it wasn't city folk who invented pigswill.</p> <p>\"I doubt that the club can call any more important press conference than announcing a new contract for their manager,\" said Ipswich chairman David Sheepshanks today, momentarily forgetting about the signing-Rivaldo conference, the beating-Real-Madrid-ten-nil conference, and the we've-annexed-Poland conference. \"George has done tremendously well over the past six years and this is due reward and recognition for that. We are fourth in the Premiership, still challenging for a [Big Cup] place and in [Euro Vase] for sure so there is a tremendous amount to celebrate.\"</p> <p>Talk about getting over-excited. And it doesn't stop there. \"I couldn't be any happier,\" said Burley himself, momentarily forgetting about how happy he would feel if he'd just single-handedly wrestled Godzilla into submission and saved Japan. \"Ipswich has always been a special club for me. This year, it has just got better and better for everyone concerned. There is lots still to be done but I am so proud of the way we have performed at the highest level.\" Yeah, well enjoy it why you can, laughing boy. When the revolution comes, attractive, home-grown, financially sound, family football clubs will be the first against the wall.</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"I have never given an interview to a dirty magazine.

And they seem to have made a difference. \"I have always said that I will do what I feel is best for the club rather than listening to supporters,\" chairman Firoz Kassam said this afternoon, \"but on Saturday there was not just a handful of fans chanting for David to go but thousands. That was not nice for me to listen to and I don't think it was very good for David either.\"</p> <p>As a result, Kemp and his assistant Alan McLeary were dismissed by Kassam following the club's annual general meeting today. \"We are moving into a new stadium for the start of next season and we will be looking to start afresh with a new manager,\" explained the chairman, who has placed former player Mike Ford in temporary control. However, Kemp was still hanging around like a bad smell, telling everyone he hadn't been sacked and that he wanted to leave anyway. \"I offered to stay for the last two games but the chairman said I might as well go straight away,\" he grimaced, kidding on he didn't care. \"It's not true that I was sacked.

Mr Jackson enjoyed an 8.5% increase on his 1999 remuneration of \u00a3494,000 to \u00a3536,000. He is now more highly paid than the BBC director general, Greg Dyke, who earned \u00a3432,000, according to the BBC's last annual accounts. But he gets significantly less than other bosses in the commercial sector. The Carlton chairman, Michael Green, got a package of \u00a3892,000 last year, in addition to his lucrative share options. Other Channel 4 executives also enjoyed significant salary rises. Tim Gardam, the broadcaster's director of programmes, saw his pay package swell from \u00a3227,000 to \u00a3262,000 - a rise of 15%, year on year. He and Janet Walker, the director of business affairs, each got \u00a325,000 in bonuses. David Brook, the Channel 4 director of strategy and development, gained a pay rise of \u00a318,000 - or nearly 7% - to \u00a3287,000. The managing director, David Scott, earned \u00a3380,000, while the commercial director, Andy Barnes, took home \u00a3376,000, \u00a3119,000 of which was a bonus. Mr Barnes is responsible for Channel 4's advertising and sponsorship. His total package was down on the year before, when he received \u00a3385,000. The total wage bill last year for Channel 4's six full-time executives, seven non-executive board members and four retired board members was \u00a32.271m - down from \u00a32.337m in 1999. Vanni Treves, the non-executive chairman, was paid \u00a362,000, while each of the non-executive board members were paid \u00a319,000 a year.",

The company's Fanta Best Mates Challenge will give talented teenagers across the country the change to appear in a series of commercials as part of a marketing blitz. Its search launches today with a series of TV commercials kicking off in tonight's episode of the Channel 4 chat show, the Priory. The advertising features real-life teenage best friends telling funny stories about what they have got up to together. They will direct viewers to a website that gives details of the \"Fanta cam\", the talent scouts that will be visiting shopping malls around the country to spot teenagers to appear in the next campaign. The campaign will run for six weeks before being replaced by a new set of adverts featuring the teenage stars. \"Programmes like Popstars have shown that fame is a great motivator for young people,\" said a Coca-Cola spokeswoman. \"The campaign is a sort of virtual circle with the TV adverts driving entries to the auditions.\" The advertising is part of a major marketing blitz from Coca-Cola that began last week with the launch of a campaign for the main Coca-Cola brand. Two more campaigns will launch on Friday, one for Dr Pepper and for Coca-Cola's new still fruit drink Alive. All four campaigns have been specially made for the UK market, a change of tack for Coca-Cola, which has traditionally tended to focus on global advertising campaigns.

Wrong answer. \"No... drugs and firearms,\" she snarled, after a pause to much hilarity. After forensic tests on all luggage, computers and Toblerones proved fruitless, she had to let them go. And finally, a return to Angus Deayton who left Montreux before he could officially be told his Have I Got News for You show had lost out to Lenny Henry, Anne Robinson, Popstars and everything else. Unwittingly, he ended up in the vicinity of journalists once again on his plane home, one of whom overheard him say this: \"Well it must have been very difficult for foreign juries to understand even with subtitles, because everyone talks over the top of each other\". Yes, Angus, yes.",

Yet the team will not require Hakkinen to play a subservient role until his own chances are effectively extinguished. </p> <p>\"In principle we will not ask one driver to drive in a supporting role to the other until he has no chance of winning the title,\" said Martin Whitmarsh, the McLaren managing director, yesterday. </p> <p>\"However, I think when you get to the point where, to all intents and purposes, our second driver in the championship placings has no longer got a reasonable chance, then we will obviously call team orders.\" </p> <p>If Coulthard stays ahead, he will eventually get the same level of support from Hakkinen as he himself provided in 1998 and '99 when he rode shotgun to the Finn in the closing races of the season after his own chances of the title had faded away. </p> <p>For the moment this means putting aside the fact that Michael Schumacher's 36 points put him eight ahead of Coulthard. Although Hakkinen is 32 points down on the Ferrari driver, which means he has to win at least three races without Schumacher scoring a point toget within striking distance, with 12 of the season's 17 races to go there is plenty of time for things to change. </p> <p>That also means, therefore, that Coulthard may have to wait some time before he is given the sort of priority treatment enjoyed by Schumacher at Ferrari. </p> <p>Schumacher's contract with the Italian team gives him absolute priority status as team leader, even though his proven superiority over first Eddie Irvine and now Rubens Barrichello means he has seldom needed to pull rank in any obtrusive fashion. </p> <p>\u0095 The crash that killed the Italian Michele Alboreto was caused by a damaged tyre, the Audi car company said yesterday. Alboreto, 44, was killed last Wednesday on the Euro-Speedway circuit at Lausitz, Germany, at the wheel of an Audi R8 that he was testing for the Le Mans 24-hour race.</p>",

      "bodyText": "David Coulthard knows better than to ask the McLaren-Mercedes management to throw their entire efforts behind his attempt on the world championship after his team-mate Mika Hakkinen's bitterly disappointing retirement from Sunday's Spanish grand prix when almost within sight of the chequered flag. The Scot, who finished fifth after stalling on the grid and getting involved in a first-corner collision, is widely regarded as the only McLaren driver to have a realistic chance of the title. Yet the team will not require Hakkinen to play a subservient role until his own chances are effectively extinguished. \"In principle we will not ask one driver to drive in a supporting role to the other until he has no chance of winning the title,\" said Martin Whitmarsh, the McLaren managing director, yesterday. \"However, I think when you get to the point where, to all intents and purposes, our second driver in the championship placings has no longer got a reasonable chance, then we will obviously call team orders.\" If Coulthard stays ahead, he will eventually get the same level of support from Hakkinen as he himself provided in 1998 and '99 when he rode shotgun to the Finn in the closing races of the season after his own chances of the title had faded away. For the moment this means putting aside the fact that Michael Schumacher's 36 points put him eight ahead of Coulthard. Although Hakkinen is 32 points down on the Ferrari driver, which means he has to win at least three races without Schumacher scoring a point toget within striking distance, with 12 of the season's 17 races to go there is plenty of time for things to change. That also means, therefore, that Coulthard may have to wait some time before he is given the sort of priority treatment enjoyed by Schumacher at Ferrari. Schumacher's contract with the Italian team gives him absolute priority status as team leader, even though his proven superiority over first Eddie Irvine and now Rubens Barrichello means he has seldom needed to pull rank in any obtrusive fashion. \u0095 The crash that killed the Italian Michele Alboreto was caused by a damaged tyre, the Audi car company said yesterday. Alboreto, 44, was killed last Wednesday on the Euro-Speedway circuit at Lausitz, Germany, at the wheel of an Audi R8 that he was testing for the Le Mans 24-hour race.",

However, slow play came on the agenda in two second-round matches. </p> <p>Peter Ebdon employed attritional tactics against Stephen Lee, who would have preferred a more free-flowing game. In Sunday's second session Ebdon's average shot time soared to 36 seconds, reduced to 33 by the close with Lee, drawn into playing similarly, on 30 seconds.

      "body": "<p>A couple of decades ago, when the mighty Imran was in his pomp and hurtling himself down the Hove slope for Sussex, he would respond to the nickname Fred, as in Khano. But how nicely ironic that the greatest captain Pakistan has possessed, indeed in the eyes of many the only captain they have ever had, should be associated with the undisputed maestro of disorganisation. </p> <p>In fact, by comparison with those who try to run Pakistan cricket, Fred Karno would be a byword for efficiency. The current situation is that flight PK 757 will be bringing the Pakistan touring team into Heathrow airport tomorrow afternoon whence, eventually, they will play two Tests and a limited-overs triangular series also involving Australia. This presupposes they can go for a month or so without everyone falling out with each other. </p> <p>Originally, according to the chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board Lt Gen Tauqir Zia, the party was to consist of 16 players captained by Waqar Younis, a wonderful bowler in his more youthful days, who has played 71 Tests and led the side ona single occasion (as it seems has just about anyone who has ever played for Pakistan) 7 years ago. </p> <p>When the squad was finally announced last Saturday, however, 17 names were read out, there having been the last-minute addition of Wasim Akram, the greatest left-arm pace bowler ever but someone whom Waqar regards as a couple of points below bubonic plague in the popularity stakes. </p> <p>They formed one of the most potent bowling partnerships in the history of the game and they have fuelled it on pure unadulterated hate. </p> <p>The team will arrive with a bowling consultant, the Australian Daryl Foster, a member of a specialised committee at the University of Western Australia which has just passed as legitimate the bowling action of another member of the party Shoaib Akhtar, the Rawalpindi Express. </p> <p>They do not have a coach, however. Javed Miandad resigned after the recent tour of New Zealand, demanding an investigation into what he described as deliberate under-performance by his players, something which has already attracted the attention of the International Cricket Council's Anti-Corruption Unit. </p> <p>The wicketkeeper in this party will not be Moin Khan, who led them against England in the winter when his delaying tactics on the final day of the series led to the match finishing at a time and in conditions normally associated with Ovaltine rather than overs, but another former captain Rashid Latif, a team-mate of Waqar in domestic cricket. </p> <p>Latif has not played a Test in three years since he came home from a tour of South Africa and Zimbabwe and accused his team-mates, a number of whom are still in the side, of match fixing. </p> <p>Not least among them are Wasim, who after the investigation by Justice Malik Qayyum was fined and banned from captaining his country again, and Waqar, who was deemed to be guilty of \"amnesia\" under questioning. </p> <p>Finally, the vice-captain of the side is Inzamam-ul-Haq, a batsman who can have you gasping at his talent and clutching your ribs at his ineptitude in the course of the same innings. This is the fellow who sits in a comfy chair while his team-mates flog their way through training sessions and fielding drills and who once, during a match in Canada, waded into the crowd, wielding a cricket bat, in pursuit of a spectator who called him a potato.

      "bodyText": "A couple of decades ago, when the mighty Imran was in his pomp and hurtling himself down the Hove slope for Sussex, he would respond to the nickname Fred, as in Khano. But how nicely ironic that the greatest captain Pakistan has possessed, indeed in the eyes of many the only captain they have ever had, should be associated with the undisputed maestro of disorganisation. In fact, by comparison with those who try to run Pakistan cricket, Fred Karno would be a byword for efficiency. The current situation is that flight PK 757 will be bringing the Pakistan touring team into Heathrow airport tomorrow afternoon whence, eventually, they will play two Tests and a limited-overs triangular series also involving Australia. This presupposes they can go for a month or so without everyone falling out with each other. Originally, according to the chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board Lt Gen Tauqir Zia, the party was to consist of 16 players captained by Waqar Younis, a wonderful bowler in his more youthful days, who has played 71 Tests and led the side ona single occasion (as it seems has just about anyone who has ever played for Pakistan) 7 years ago. When the squad was finally announced last Saturday, however, 17 names were read out, there having been the last-minute addition of Wasim Akram, the greatest left-arm pace bowler ever but someone whom Waqar regards as a couple of points below bubonic plague in the popularity stakes. They formed one of the most potent bowling partnerships in the history of the game and they have fuelled it on pure unadulterated hate. The team will arrive with a bowling consultant, the Australian Daryl Foster, a member of a specialised committee at the University of Western Australia which has just passed as legitimate the bowling action of another member of the party Shoaib Akhtar, the Rawalpindi Express. They do not have a coach, however. Javed Miandad resigned after the recent tour of New Zealand, demanding an investigation into what he described as deliberate under-performance by his players, something which has already attracted the attention of the International Cricket Council's Anti-Corruption Unit. The wicketkeeper in this party will not be Moin Khan, who led them against England in the winter when his delaying tactics on the final day of the series led to the match finishing at a time and in conditions normally associated with Ovaltine rather than overs, but another former captain Rashid Latif, a team-mate of Waqar in domestic cricket. Latif has not played a Test in three years since he came home from a tour of South Africa and Zimbabwe and accused his team-mates, a number of whom are still in the side, of match fixing. Not least among them are Wasim, who after the investigation by Justice Malik Qayyum was fined and banned from captaining his country again, and Waqar, who was deemed to be guilty of \"amnesia\" under questioning. Finally, the vice-captain of the side is Inzamam-ul-Haq, a batsman who can have you gasping at his talent and clutching your ribs at his ineptitude in the course of the same innings. This is the fellow who sits in a comfy chair while his team-mates flog their way through training sessions and fielding drills and who once, during a match in Canada, waded into the crowd, wielding a cricket bat, in pursuit of a spectator who called him a potato. He does not want Wasim there, either. Genuinely, one could not make this lot up. But the relationship between Waqar and Wasim is the intriguing one. Wasim, unquestionably, is a genius, the only player to have taken more than 400 wickets in both the long and short form of international cricket. His partnership with Waqar was arguably the most devastating of all time, with more wickets taken as an opening combination than any other, although they were especially productive when the ball was old and reverse swinging. Waqar, for his part, has 319 wickets and a remarkable strike rate of a wicket per roughly 43 balls. He maintains he would have had a shed-load more victims, too, if Wasim, during his own tenure(s) as captain, particularly the last one, had not ignored him where possible. In 1993 Waqar was at the centre of a players' revolt against Wasim who, he believes, has been determined to get even ever since. During the 1999 World Cup, in which Pakistan reached the final, Waqar played only one match after the side had qualified for the later stages and was pointedly ignored for much of the subsequent tour of Australia. For this tour Waqar could make out a genuine case, as opposed to one based purely on antipathy, for not including Wasim, who has performed sporadically in recent years and has become increasingly prone to injury. Now, though, he has been imposed upon him in the worst possible way, by the casting vote of Tauqir Zia, against Waqar's vehement wishes and by some accounts following intervention from Imran. Not that Wasim will get a game if Waqar has his way. \"I cannot assure him a place in the side for the first Test,\" the new captain said on Sunday. \"I would like to play Shoaib Akhtar, Mohammad Sami, Abdur Razzaq and Saqlain Mushtaq.\" So, Wasim has had his card marked.

It had educated the public to think it was as fiscally continent as the Tories. In February 1997 49% of those polled believed that once Labour came to power it would spend more than the Tories. Four years later that figure was 24%. Indeed, more people believed the Tories would spend more if they achieved office.</p> <p>This turnaround stemmed from Labour's key promise in the run-up to the 1997 election: to stick to Tory spending plans for the first two years. Perhaps it was \"existentially\" necessary to sunder Labour from its past. But from it grew an enervating sense of disappointment in Labour ranks and among the public at large. Where, people asked, were the better schools and surgeries they thought Labour would build - though Labour's formal promises in 1997 promised nothing of the kind.</p> <p>Besides, only a third of the public actually cast their ballots for Tony Blair in 1997, which might imply that most people had willed either the status quo or minimal change. None the less the buzz had been that Labour would be better for public services and, though that has eventually been proved to be true, the differences after four years are not as dramatic as expected. They couldn't be when, in aggregate, the UK state as a proportion of GDP declined. In John Major's last year the ratio of government spending to GDP was 41.2. It will still be less than that (40.6%) when Gordon Brown's extensive spending plans are realised by March 2004. The economy, of course, is growing so the physical resources available for public services will expand. Still, Labour's Third Way has not been a bonanza for public services. Blairism offered no fundamental recalibration of the importance of government in our society or economy.</p> <p>The first Blair government has been busy. Its large majority tramped through the lobbies passing a raft of laws. A book could be written enumerating the policy initiatives and plans, made and accomplished. (We wrote it)</p> <p>An audit of the Blair term might note, first, that there are no signs of improvement on what Labour ministers themselves identified as the battleground of modern governance: productivity. On it depends the capacity of the economy to break through the limits that have kept annual growth below 3%. Labour no longer believes the state should own significant economic assets nor plan in any traditional sense. Its main job is making markets more competitive, pulling down barriers to trade and improving the quality of the factors of production.</p> <p>But government can aid science and research, in so doing improving capital, and above all it can educate and train. Labour would say that it has. The Blair cabinet can notch up improved educational attainments in the primary sector and continuing improvements at exams for 16- and 18-year-olds. The expansion of higher education has continued, unimpeded by Labour's introduction of university tuition charges and the abolition of student maintenance grants. A start has been made on reshaping vocational education. But British productivity rates remain below those in both the United States and the allegedly bloated welfare states of France and Germany.</p> <p>Fearful of saying anything remotely critical about business or the British system of free enterprise, Labour ministers were never heard to speculate about one possible reason - deformations in the business culture and corporate sector. Instead the chancellor, Gordon Brown, led a chorus extolling enterprise, blaming culture for being insufficiently attuned to economic opportunity, but never addressing the structure of economic power as a possible cause of under-achievement.</p> <p>But if Labour did not affect such fundamentals as productivity, it did manage to accomplish some traditional goals of socialism, including making Britain a fairer place. Changes were small in scale but noteworthy. The combined impact of Labour's changes in tax and social security increased the income of the bottom 10th of households by some 8%, over \u00a38 a week, and it cut the income of the richest 10th by 0.5%, or \u00a34.74 a week. Economic growth (2.6% on average since 1997) may have pulled the income distribution at large into an even more unequal shape. Labour's measures hindered rather than helped that outcome.</p> <p>A ledger of achievements is hard to compile because Labour policies often contradicted each other. For example, in fulfilment of a 1997 manifesto promise, Gordon Brown cut VAT on domestic fuel to 5%: in other words, he encouraged the consumption of fossil fuels. His levy on climate change, due to be introduced in April 2001, is meant to do the opposite. It was bitterly resisted by industrialists, though it will be critical in cutting emissions of greenhouse gases in line with promises made at the Kyoto summit. Devolution of power to the new parliament in Edinburgh and, to a lesser extent, the Cardiff assembly was not accompanied by reform at Westminster. The creation of a London mayor and assembly was not matched by a coherent reappraisal of Whitehall's relationship with elective local government in England. A \"liberal\" approach to matters of sexual orientation led Labour to equalise the age of consent and seek the abolition of Section 28 (accomplished by the Scottish parliament but not at Westminster, after the conservative majority in the House of Lords mobilised).</p> <p>A \"progressive\" approach to justice for young people was accompanied by a punitive policy for adult offenders leading to a 6,000-person increase in the prison population from 1997 onwards, even though no greater number of criminals was being caught. A muscular determination to uphold human rights in the Balkans did not prevent Labour pursuing commercial opportunities in China, despite the regime's record. The reconfiguration of the UK's defence after a widely praised review still left room for procurement decisions that had more to do with trade and constituency interest than military posture.</p> <p>The social account is especially full, in principle as much as in practice. The various New Deals promised that nobody was going to be left out of the labour market. The Sure Start programme was introduced for poor young children; the incomes of poor families with children were greatly augmented; and money was found for pensioners, not across the board but concentrated on the poorest.</p> <p>Schools, especially primaries, have been given new focus and teachers are returning to the public's esteem. After April 2001, teachers' salaries will reflect that rising esteem.</p> <p>At work Labour established the minimum wage and for the first time gave workers a formal right to belong to a trade union.</p> <p>Of course all judgements must be interim. The great spending increase announced in July 2000 only comes on stream in April 2001. Tony Blair liked to point out how little Margaret Thatcher accomplished in her first term - she had barely thought of privatisation.

      "bodyText": "Thousands of community police thronged the centre of London as pro-free market protesters converged on the capital today. There were no reports of arrests or violence as the first wave of demonstrators slowly drove their cars along the city's cycle ways. Metropolitan community police commissioner Errol Winston dismissed rumours that his mostly female force would use the controversial virtual rubber bullet system if the demonstration grew violent. There have also been reports, dismissed by the authorities, that the police may use high-volume broadcasts of songs by Dame Kylie Minogue to break up the rallies - a tactic which experts warn could cause lasting brain damage. \"We have no need of these draconian methods,\" said an MPC spokesperson. \"We hope that the demonstration will be peaceful, but if it isn't, we will be relying on proven community police techniques, like issuing quite stern warnings.\" As the demonstrators gathered in grounds of the People's Rest Home at the western end of the Mall, the mood was determined. One pro-capitalism protester, dressed provocatively in a three-piece suit with a collar and tie, told Guardian Unlimited that politicians and police had exaggerated the risk of confrontation. \"We haven't come here looking for trouble,\" he said. \"Of course you will always get a lunatic fringe element, like the people who want to bring back the Conservative party, but they are a tiny minority.\" As he spoke, there was a ragged cheer from the crowd and a chant of \"What do we want? Individual savings accounts! When do we want 'em? Now!\" The prime minister, Leo Blair, repeated his appeal for calm and restraint on all sides, while offering total support to the police. Echoing his famous father's rallying cry, he added: \"You know, we really have to be sensible about this. I mean, if we were not, it wouldn't be, you know, sensible.\" The demonstrations have attracted widespread interest abroad. In Brussels, United States of Europe officials are assessing the damage that the protests might do to Britain's prospects of finally joining the euro zone. One source said the disruption to the largely rural British economy could knock the value of the pound, now standing at an all-time low of \u00a356,250 to the euro. In Washington, President George Bush III has reiterated his offer to buy Britain, and turn it into what he calls a \"thematically themed theme park\".

      "bodyText": "Waitrose will this week launch its first-ever TV advertising, nearly two months after it postponed the campaign due to the outbreak of foot and mouth. The supermarket giant had been due to launch the advertising in March. But it decided to delay the multimillion pound campaign because one of the three adverts focused on a herd of cows that produce milk for Waitrose - a subject deemed too sensitive at the time. Waitrose has won many plaudits for its print advertising, created by its agency, Banks Hoggins O'Shea/FCB, but has never advertised on TV before. The \u00a32.5m campaign will be in the same vein as the press adverts, which emphasise the quality of Waitrose products with the slogan, \"Waitrose - quality food, honestly priced\". The advert for Waitrose milk shows a tanker travelling through green countryside and boasts how \"only one supermarket knows every farm and farmer that supplies every pint of its fresh milk\". The Waitrose managing director, David Felwick, said the campaign came as the chain, which employs 27,000 workers and has 136 stores nationwide, announced a first quarter rise of 14% on \u00a32bn-a-year sales in the three months to the end of April. \"We decided to break with tradition because we now feel it is a wider audience which should hear our message,\" he said. \"Our TV campaign helps to explain the Waitrose difference. The Food Standards Agency has shown that three-quarters of consumers are concerned about food safety and we are showing how we are first for freshness, attention to detail, quality and value.\"",

One permanent secretary, a strong Europhile, told me not long ago that there wasn't a chance of the pound being abolished for the next decade. Top people at the Bank of England say the same. When EU reform proposals emerge, such as yesterday's from Gerhard Schr\u00f6der's SPD, caricatured with the unfailing factual deficiency of the British media as building-blocks for a superstate, these mordant witnesses are confirmed in their belief that Tony Blair will duck the euro-crunch for the indefinite future.</p> <p>This belief rests on a mass of historic evidence about politicians. Political leaders seldom take life-threatening gambles that are not forced upon them. In this case, though, the hoary seers are out of touch. They underestimate the prime minister's commitment. They also, probably, misread a shift in Gordon Brown's position. It remains to be seen how much Europe gets into the election campaign. Maybe rather little. But what happens after that will be seismic. It grows out of an analysis that's far deeper than Mr Blair, trapped in domestic crisis-management for the last nine months, has yet chosen to explain.</p> <p>He sees the Europe question with ever greater clarity, and will make it his prime preoccupation, alongside public service reform, immediately the next term begins. June 8 is ground zero for Britain-in-Europe. Entry into the euro has become in Blair's mind a destiny question, for Britain and himself. Even the size of the majority is insignificant beside it. Those who say a three-figure majority must surely be a precondition for the gamble are rebutted with the assertion that a single-figure lead would be enough. But that's an academic point. The majority will not be single figures. Anticipating a much larger one, Blair is beginning to assemble a critical mass of momentum for the policy which, in 1997, he declared against: a purposeful campaign for swift entry into the single currency.</p> <p>The economics, for a start, are converging. With an interest rate gap of barely 1%, euro-land looks more congenial. The economic bedrock has always been vital, not just a verbal sideshow. Sceptics will find some reason to challenge the economics for the next several decades, but for anyone else the time is getting as ripe as it will ever be. The notion, incidentally, that the economic assessment will be made exclusively by the Treasury is self-serving poppycock. The prime minister will be closely engaged.</p> <p>The politics also are ripening. Urgency begins to press. The debate about the future of Europe, to which the German SPD paper is an early contribution, reaches climax in 2004. The next EU presidency, held by Belgium, will coincide with the likely launch of Britain's euro debate, and is a matter of some alarm to the Brits. They see the Belgians accelerating the 2004 process along integrationist lines. When Blair met the Belgian prime minister, Guy Verhofstadt, last week it was in the hope of deflecting the kind of centralising and harmonising proposals canvassed also by the Germans.</p> <p>However divided the EU may be about that trend, it's certain to keep on intruding into the 2004 debate. This poses problems for a British leader who has a different vision, yet knows that his chances of winning allies for it will be much diminished by the UK's absence from Europe's central project. My impression is that he has a chance to finesse his way around that. But it's the last one. The Euro-centralisers, all of whom want Britain in the euro, may be prepared to delay and soften their ambitions, but only on one condition: that Blair gets off the fence and commits to a critical path towards a referendum, probably next year.</p> <p>This plays into another crucial circumstance, which again compels the British leader towards an early decision. The euro and its political structures are not static. The evolution of the EU, with enlargement coming, will continue. It will be, in some measure, integrationist, though the methodology is debated. It will make the EU progressively more objectionable to the same nationalist forces that dominate the British press now. The longer that hiatus lasts, with Britain clinging to the margin and still postponing the decisive referendum, the harder it will be to win any contest - after five more years of baleful propaganda that deepens British anti-Europeanism and exposes Blair to ridicule for another term of feeble indecision.</p> <p>So tactical preparations are being made. People in Downing Street and the Cabinet Office are sketching the path, phase by phase, to a referendum, drafting words that might be said on June 8, at the Labour party conference, on a series of other landmark dates in the next nine months. More important is a looming shift in the psychodrama: a strategic undertaking to frontally address the intimidatory power of the Murdoch, Rothermere and Black press, and sweep it aside. That doesn't mean the papers can be ignored. Their arguments have to be taken seriously and countered. But the fact of deciding to hold the referendum will remove one of the most potent elements in this enduring political stand-off: the belief that, because the sceptic grip on the press is so tight, and the polling evidence so unfavourable, Blair wouldn't have the nerve to presume he might overturn both factors.</p> <p>How he may go about this I'll discuss on Thursday. Before he gets there, he has colleagues to consider. Most of the cabinet will be less sanguine than he is, though none is a Eurosceptic. He evidently doesn't expect to have any difficulty in bringing them in behind him, especially if he does get the large majority. There's only one colleague who matters. But he does matter a great deal.</p> <p>Gordon Brown's role in the saga has been enigmatic. To an extent, it still is. He's as jealous of his economic power as he is of his political ambition. A successful referendum would curb the former, a failed one might destroy the latter. Because, above all other things, Gordon wants to be prime minister, perhaps he can't face that risk. There are those who believe that if Brown doesn't stop Blair taking the plunge, he will find a score of furtive ways to limit the damage to himself in case it ends in a fatal drowning. A sulking Brown, skulking on the sides of the campaign, is summoned up.</p> <p>This now looks unlikely. Close observers find the chancellor getting his pro-euro arguments into place. A month ago, abandoning his notorious veto on discussion, he told Michael Portillo, in a carefully framed Commons reply, that he was \"happy for the general election campaign ... to be fought with a considerable amount of debate on the issue of the euro.\" He may not like it.

The Scottish-based company has suffered from heavy losses due to expansion of its UK network, but Thus today said it was ready to reap the rewards from its expenditure. William Allen, the chief executive of Thus, said underlying profits would turn positive before the end of the financial year, as the company unveiled a full-year pre-tax loss of \u00a363m, up from \u00a366.9m last year. A competitive telecoms market has forced the company to gamble its future on becoming a business-focused operator in a bid to separate itself from smaller rivals. \"Our improving performance demonstrates a successful strategy to move our company from a regional to a national, business focused, service provider,\" said Mr Allen. \"The service integration, network reach and quality provided by Thus has already attracted a portfolio of large scale, national corporate and SME accounts.\" The long-awaited statement boosted the company's beleaguered shares by 13% in early trading. Thus stock has lost 85% of its value over the last year, collapsing from a high of 844p. Revenues rose 8% to \u00a3234m for the year to March, at the top end of analysts' expectations, while turnover at its business services division climbed 31% to \u00a3160m. However, the telecoms operator's troublesome interactive division continued to underperform, with revenues tumbling 34% to \u00a322.7m. Thus said the \u00a315m operation should be sold by the end of June, following nine formal offers for the loss-making subsidiary. Thus has built up a debt of \u00a3167.8m and is working with parent company Scottish Power to ensure it has enough funding until its underlying profits turn positive over the next 12 months.

A successful deal would have brought together the Spice Girls, Robbie Williams and Whitney Houston under the same label, and would have given EMI a much-needed boost in the US market. EMI must now attempt to forge its own way in a stagnating market that has seen six successive years of falling record sales and only offers modest margin and revenue growth. However, EMI offset the merger news with a preview of its full-year results, which are due on May 22. Revenues rose 12% to \u00a32.7bn and adjusted pre-tax profits rose by 6% to \u00a3260m, which boosted the group's shares by over 2%. Related story 01.05.2001: EMI merger with BMG stumbles",

      "bodyText": "Hundreds of family doctors are today closing their surgeries or staging a \"work to rule\" in protest about their working conditions, despite the refusal of their trade union to back them. Around 100 surgeries were expected to close, while other doctors were planning to either only see patients and do no paperwork, or refuse appointments and only perform administrative tasks. The British Medical Association (BMA), which proposes to ballot its family doctor members about resignation from the NHS, says it cannot support the action because it would harm patients and break trade union laws. Health minister John Denham described the action as \"uneccessary\", although he admitted that the government's NHS reforms had put pressure on GPs and their staff. He said: \"There is no need for action to persuade us of that. What we want to do is work with the professions to tackle these pressures and we are doing that in a number of ways.\" Mr Denham also attacked the BMA over its decision to ballot members over what it sees as the slow progress the government has made over the introduction of a new GP contract. In a letter to BMA GPs' committee chairman Dr John Chisholm, Mr Denham said: \"I cannot accept that the progress of contract negotiations provides any rational for balloting your members.\" He added: \"It is hard to avoid the conclusion that the GPC (general practitioners' committee) is set on a particular course of action irrespective of anything we might do.\" The minister listed a series of initiatives which he said he would improve the lives of all staff working in primary care, inlcuding a planned expansion of the GP workforce, and a reduction in GPs' paperwork. The GPs' day of action has been organised by Doctor magazine after a survey showed that eight out of 10 family doctors would quit the NHS if they could. Doctors have complained that government initiatives and targets are leaving them overstretched, with increased bureaucracy and less time to see patients. The average GP now has just eight minutes to see each patient and doctors claim they cannot deliver the necessary standards of care. Phil Johnson, editor of Doctor, said: \"We estimate that about 100 practices across the country will close, and many are shutting down for the whole day. \"Something like 1,000 others will be showing active support in other ways, but it could be much more than that. We don't know what the full scale of support is going to be.\" Mr Johnson said that in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, all 40 GPs in about a dozen surgeries were planning to walk out. In Marlow, Buckinghamshire, the town's only practice covering 20,000 patients was also closing for the day. Dr Chisholm said: \"I understand and share the concerns of general practitioners. Many of them are at breaking point because of their intolerable workload. \"It is important that the government listens to their concerns and takes urgent action to give patients the high quality service they deserve and which doctors want to provide - a service that protects patient health and safety, and the health of family doctors too. \"For that very reason, doctors will not wish to take any action that damages the care their patients receive.\"",

      "bodyText": "A huge row over tobacco advertising has divided delegates at the anti-tobacco treaty talks in Geneva. Advertising has become the flashpoint of talks among the world's nations to stem the spread of tobacco-related death and disease. The treaty, sponsored by the World Health Organisation, aims to achieve worldwide agreement on issues such as tobacco smuggling and packaging. The African nations have united in advocating a total ban in the face of the draft treaty, which has set out a milder alternative - a ban on advertising targeting under-18s. But the US, the EU, Japan and other countries are happy to endorse the under-18s ban, which leaves tobacco companies some room for manoeuvre. Clive Bates, the director of anti-smoking pressure group Action on Smoking and Health, is in Geneva this week to lobby for a tougher treaty. Mr Bates believes that if the treaty's position on tobacco advertising is not strengthened it could damage other anti-tobacco advertising legislation. \"If this draft is agreed it is worse than useless and will create a really bad precedent,\" he said. \"It sends a signal to developing countries that tobacco advertising is a kids' issue, that restrictions should be concentrated on young people with a laissez-faire attitude on everyone else.\" Related stories 30.04.2001: Anti-tobacco treaty rejects advertising ban 30.04.2001: Ad-free dream fades MediaGuardian.co.uk special report Tobacco advertising and promotion",

And we don't expect that to change any time soon, well, unless a draconian government comes to power. We have our self-regulations, usually unwritten, but inbred in most local journalists. The press, and the media at large, has to be culturally sensitive, the need arising from traditional ties to and respect for traditional Fijian institutions like the Great Council of Chiefs and also high chiefs. The coup last May was one of the most trying times for local journalists, especially, the indigenous; but everyone came out of that experience wiser. There were times during the coup when the terrorists attacked and threatened the media: on May 28th the Fiji Television station in Suva was trashed by armed terrorists, forcing the station off air for two days and there were numerous threats to local newspapers for stories not suiting the terrorists' tastes throughout the crisis. Near parliament in Suva, where the terrorists had taken the government hostage, Fiji Sun cameraman, Sitiveni Moce was assaulted by armed gunmen and ended up hospitalised. The sensitivities so prevalent in the Fijian society were tested and many indigenous journalists had to live with the reprimand of their kinsmen for trying to maintain objectivity during the whole crisis. Indo-fijian journalists like myself, were encouraged not to go near parliament by most media organisations out of fear they might be attacked the nationalist gunmen. As one of the few Indo-fijian faces around parliament on Friday 19th last May, I felt anything but secure. One of the classic cases of a journalist being shunned by his own people for not respecting his chief is Jo Nata, sadly a coup accomplice last May and in custody right now. Nata did investigative reports on business dealings of his chief and former president Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara and was rebuked by his people. That aside, there is a local media code ethics but the onus is on the individual journalist to adhere to it. We count ourselves lucky coming out of the political crisis last year without having any restrictions imposed and I guess we should be when we look at the plight of our counterparts overseas who have not been as lucky.

Asked yesterday whether he was pleased to have been able to prove them wrong, David Sumner, the society's chairman, said: \"Not half.\" \"Seventy-four locks had been destroyed, 17 bridges lowered, five pipe lines laid at water level, and 2,200 metres of the line had been filled in,\" he said at the opening ceremony. \"It's a great testament to the faith of everyone who has supported us. It's the end of a hard slog.\" The society brought together three local councils and British Waterways for a \u00a330m restoration programme supported by a \u00a314.85m grant from the millennium commission and \u00a312m from English Partnerships. The newly restored route is expected to create 400 jobs and generate investment along the canal corridor. In the canal's commercial heyday, leggers used their feet to propel boats through the Standedge tunnel in about four hours. But in 1914, David Whitehead, a stocky man with, according to a contemporary photograph, a perilously an gled flat cap, walked a boat through in 85 minutes. Today's boats will be pulled through by the electronic tug. One trip between Marsden and Diggle costs \u00a335 per boat and will take more than three hours.",

A statement from PMP said the merger had been halted because concessions required by the Australian anti-monopolies watchdog would have undermined the value of the merger. \"While a merger in its original form would have enhanced shareholder returns, PMP has concluded that the concessions likely to be required to address the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission concerns would substantially reduce the value of the merger to shareholders,\" the statement said. Under the existing merger plan, IPMG would have taken a 40% stake in PMP. A spokesman for Attic Futura said it was too early to comment on how the development would affect the company. After the merger plans were announced in March, Attic Futura, which publishes teen titles Sugar, Shine and the new CD:UK magazine, took back control of its UK titles from joint ownership with its German parent company, North South. Several UK publishers were named as potential buyers of Attic Futura after PMP said it planned to divest itself of the company. The National Magazine Company, IPC and Emap were thought to be the frontrunners in the race to buy the company. PMP was believed to be seeking an asking price of around \u00a360m.",

      "body": "<p>The tiny Toyota Yaris was European Car of the Year in 2000 and would even now be hard to shove aside in another category - the Dinkiest Among Dinkies. Back in an all-new sporty format, the Yaris cheerfully embraces many of the design aspects of the toy delivery van - particularly in its snubbed front end and its Tonka-style bumpers. Once you get over the way that its name sounds unpromisingly like Cockney slang for the backside (\"I gave it a good kick up the Yaris\"), this car is as cute as a fluffy pencil case. </p> <p>Cute and small. It makes a basic hatchback look almost wantonly space-consuming and vulgar. In Paris, where parking is done with a professional elan that British urban parkers can only be in awe of, the Yaris is the sort of car you might see wedged backwards into a gap, its bumper parallel with the kerb. </p> <p>Still, these days, a car that craves a reputation for city-friendly titchiness has really got to work for it. Both the jocularly tiny Smart and the Mercedes A class have opened up the market for all-weather golf carts and if your prime requirement from a car is the ability to be able to park it in a pothole, the Smart in particular (roughly half the price and almost half the size) would serve you more fulsomely than the Yaris. </p> <p>The difference is that the Yaris - for all its dinkydom and its readiness to continue down the kind of narrow urban roads where even cyclists might think about dismounting - is properly a four-seater car, and not just a four-seater in a merely cosmetic or wishful sense. Most of us will, at some time or other, have been obliged to force ourselves into the back of an alleged four-seater in which the rear cabin is actually little more than an upholstered parcel-shelf, on which there is only room to sit comfortably if you happen to be a nodding dog or an expert in tantric yoga. </p> <p>From the outside, the Yaris seems set to offer passengers this kind of experience in spades. You know, from the width of the doors, that the driver and his cohort are going to be OK. But what about the people in the back, behind those tiny porthole windows? Aren't they going to be needing oxygen, or even a saline solution, by the time they've finished in there? And how are they going to get into the car in the first place? From the pavement, you may fancy your best chance is by going in head-first via the boot, punching out the seat-backs and clambering through the gap. </p> <p>But no. Thanks to a spatial illusion unrivalled since the Tardis, the front seats of the Yaris tip enough to allow fairly dignified passage to the back, where one can sit upright and uncrushed in a cabin that is startlingly roomy and, thanks to the sunroof, perfectly airy. One can even avail oneself of the facilities: a moulded drinks holder and an overhead light. That doesn't sound like a lot, but bear in mind that in many rival city cars you wouldn't be looking for somewhere to rest your grande latte; you'd be sitting with cramp in your neck and your knees in your ears. </p> <p>The traditional drawback with city cars is pace. In something like a Seat Arosa, in order to get to speeds above 40mph you need to apply in writing to the accelerator several days in advance. Hence the new T Sport version of the Yaris. T Sport is the brand name for Toyota's new soup-up routine; other models in the Toyota range are soon to be given the T Sport treatment. In the case of the Yaris, the makeover has involved stiffening the suspension and the steering, for that special Mika Hakkinen feeling, and equipping the car with a 1.5 litre engine, which doesn't sound astonishingly powerful, but is more than capable of moving something that is roughly the size and weight of a cardboard box. </p> <p>As a result, the new Yaris can be made to whip around the place and achieve speed as and when needed. That said, you will have to put up with the noise of the engine, which may not be one of the most refined sounds in modern motoring. Other connoisseurs may differ, but I was getting washing machine, with some persistent top notes of lawnmower. </p> <p>Should city cars be aiming to go small anyway? Arguably, the curse of modern urban driving isn't the absence of parking space so much as the proliferation of speed bumps. In which case, what you need isn't a tiny car but a tank. Needless to say, hitting a speed bump in the Yaris felt like being tossed into an empty skip. </p> <p>Other reservations: the dashboard is a grim tundra of slick plastic; the dials are in the middle of the dash, located in their own elliptical bay and angled exclusively towards the driver - depriving passengers of the fun of complaining about how fast you are going.

      "bodyText": "Hollywood is working on a cliffhanger which will reach its climax tonight in one of five ways, which include its film and television actors being left speechless. The 11,500 members of the Writers' Guild of America may strike now, defer action until the summer, win or lose the battle, or arrive at a compromise with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers. A strike would test the Cheers writer and producer Rob Long's assertion in Conversations With My Agent, his insider's account of screen industry bedlam, that \"the main reason television sitcoms are so bad is that too many educated people are involved in creating them\". On the big screen an eventual return to work might resemble the world of F Scott Fitzgerald's Pat Hobby Stories, the sour 1930s satires about a washed-up hack writer trying, none too hard and none too successfully, to get back into the business. \"It could be a disaster all round if a strike should hold,\" said Paul Schulman, president of Schulman/Adanswers, a New York media-buying company. \"Some people will desert permanently, finding other things to do with their time: on the internet or with programming, other than network programming.\" Neither side was speaking to the press yesterday but the feeling was that neither wanted to risk a strike when the economy is slowing down, or to repeat the 1988 stoppage which is estimated to have cost the industry $500m (\u00a3347m). On that occasion the writers made their point by picketing studios with wordless banners. Richard Riordan, the mayor of Los Angeles, has produced a study which estimates that a strike would cost the city $6.9bn (\u00a34.8bn) in business and 130,000 jobs, raising the unemployment rate from 4.8% to 6.9%. Negotiations between the parties broke down in March and resumed at the weekend. The main issue for film writers is respect for their craft: they want to curb directors who like to put their names after the phrase \"A film by\", even though they may not have written any of it. The television writers are more concerned about money: they want a bigger share of the residuals, the payments received when shows are sold abroad or on tape or DVD, or are rerun on television. If there is a strike, cinema-goers and television viewers will not notice much of a difference at first. The studios have accelerated production and have 76 more films on general release than at this time last year. Television shows such as Sex in the City would not be affected because the summer schedules are completed. In time, however, the small screen might have to run more script-free \"reality\" shows such as Survivor, and firm producers might turn to old unproduced scripts or foreign films. \"Imagine if the networks' Monday line-up was essentially Survivor, Millionaire and Weakest Link, and then on Tuesday Survivor, Millionaire, and Weakest Link,\" said Doug Lieblein, a writer-producer of the CBS comedy Yes, Dear. \"The networks may pretend that won't kill them, but it will.\" There was little television production planned until the summer, he said.",

      "bodyText": "The future of the BT chief executive, Sir Peter Bonfield, was looking even more uncertain this morning after the telecoms group revealed plans to sell its Japanese assets. BT confirmed it is negotiating the sale of its highly prized 20% stakes in Japan Telecom and J-Phone to its arch-rival, Vodafone. \"BT today confirms that it is currently in discussions with Vodafone regarding the possible acquisition by Vodafone of BT's interests in Japan Telecom and the J-Phone Group,\" BT said in a statement. Although a successful deal would shave \u00a33bn off BT's \u00a330bn debt burden, it would also signal the abandonment of one of Sir Peter's core strategies. He has made no secret of his ambition to conquer the Japanese telecoms market, but his attempt to muscle in on the far east has left BT with expensive and ineffective minority stakes. Shareholders have openly questioned the value of the stakes, when BT had no hope of converting them into a majority, despite repeated claims that its Japanese holdings were key investments. The debt-reduction package, and Sir Peter's fate, will be sealed by a \u00a35bn rights issue. The sale of new shares will anger shareholders who have already had their fingers burnt by a volatile telecoms sector, but they will accept the move as long as it results in a P45 landing on Sir Peter's desk before the end of the month. Today's announceent, which also revealed the possible sale of BT's Airtel asset in Spain, comes as the BBC boss, Sir Christopher Bland, arrives at BT headquarters for his first day as chairman of the group. He will lead a board meeting to discuss other debt-slashing options, which will include the trade sale of its Yell directories business. BT shares rose nearly 5% to 585p in early trading, while Vodafone fell 1% to 210p. Vodafone will be very close to majority control of Japanese mobile phone company J-Phone if the deal goes through, giving it a prime position in the world's most mature mobile phone market. Telecoms operators see Japan as the perfect testing ground for 3G mobile phone services, which promise high-speed internet access, data, video and CD-quality music services.

      "body": "<p>After months of heated debate, China's parliament has finally amended the national marriage law to deal with men who \"keep a second woman.\"</p> <p>An amendment to the 20-year-old marriage law, approved by the standing committee of the national people's congress, states that \"cohabitation (by a married person) with another person is prohibited.\"</p> <p>The change will not, by itself, bring about a sharp reduction in the second households kept by many officials and businessmen - usually in discreet suburbs outside the city limits. The legislators have drawn a distinction between bigamy, which is already punished under the criminal code, and cohabitation, which carries no such sanction.</p> <p>Aggrieved spouses seeking to divorce a cohabiting husband may now seek financial compensation in the civil courts - something that was not available before - but the legislators have resisted demands for cohabitation to be turned into an actual crime.</p> <p>\"We certainly cannot deal with all behaviour which undermines marriage by legal measures,\" says marriage law professor Wu Changzhen, who helped draft the amendment.</p> <p>Yet the concept of a morality that is in need of defence by society and the state still plays a much greater part in China than in the west. Ms Wu goes on to say that the measures that should be adopted include \"public opinion, moral censure and the restraint of communist party discipline.\"</p> <p>The problem of \"keeping a second woman\" is closely associated, and for good reasons, with the growth of corruption over the past two decades and the decline of what many still loosely refer to as \"socialist\" morality.</p> <p>Statistics abound to prove the point: in 95% of corruption cases in Guangdong province over recent years, it is explained, the guilty official or businessman was running a second household.</p> <p>The \"other woman\" factor has sometimes been exploited crudely by the official press to explain away the worst cases of massive corruption running into billions of Chinese yuan.</p> <p>It is also easier to focus upon an aspect of changing male sexual behaviour that is still relatively uncommon because of the financial outlay needed. Far more men regularly visit prostitutes without incurring the same censure.</p> <p>Yet running a second household also has a particular resonance for a society in which the memory of concubinage is still recent - and a popular theme for film and drama.</p> <p>It implies too that the \"feudal\" attitudes, thought to have been eradicated by the revolution, are still widespread.</p> <p>The first marriage law, drafted soon after the 1949 communist victory, sought with some success to establish new standards for equality between the sexes and shared responsibility for child-rearing.</p> <p>Yet over the Maoist decades, this emphasis upon normal family life too often became a repressive instrument, forcing unhappy couples to stay together and severely punishing sexual misbehaviour.</p> <p>The post-Mao reforms since 1978 have been followed, though at first more slowly, by a loosening of these political-cum-social restraints. In recent years, the pace of change has increased to a point which scandalises the old party faithful.</p> <p>Sexual experimentation before marriage is widely accepted and some young Chinese even opt to remain unmarried - unthinkable in the past, where staying single was regarded as deviant behaviour.</p> <p>Many women taking part in the debate over revisions to the law acknowledge the need to recognise that China is a more diverse society, but fear that it is also becoming more exploitative again.</p> <p>There were hopes that the amendments would impose tougher measures against domestic violence, which is said by the Chinese women's federation to occur in three out of 10 families and to be a factor in three-fifths of divorce cases.</p> <p>Yet the law still only deals with the problem in general terms. A new provision of protecting the rights of children born outside marriage is more specific, providing for financial support by the father and stipulating equal rights with those born in wedlock.</p> <p>Away from the Chinese cities, the effect of the new amendments will still depend upon popular acceptance - far from assured in many rural areas, where Chinese feminists complain that male attitudes are reverting to feudalism.</p> <p>Some would argue that the largest category of exploited women today are not wives - whether first or second - in relatively well off urban households. They are the hundreds of thousands of rural women - including thousands of under age girls - who are forced into prostitution or sexual slavery.</p> <p><b>Email</b><br> <a href=\"mailto:john.gittings@theguardian.com\">john.gittings@theguardian.com</a></p> <p><b>Related special reports</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/china/ \">China</a><br></p> <p><b>Other articles</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.searchunlimited.co.uk/search97cgi/s97networkr_cgi?QueryText=%28john+gittings%29AND+%28VdkPublicationDate+%3E%3D+01%2DSep%2D1998%29&amp;ResultColSize=2000&amp;ResultTemplate=ArchiveFull%2Ehts&amp;Collection=archive&amp;SortSpec=score+Desc&amp;Query=john+gittings&amp;ResultStart=1&amp;ResultCount=10&amp;ResultMaxDocs=1000&amp;Dtv=\">More articles by John Gittings</a></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.chinadevelopmentbrief.com/\" target=\"_new\">China Briefing</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.china.org.cn/\" target=\"_new\">Chinese government</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.peopledaily.com.cn/english/\" target=\"_new\">People's Daily</a><br><a href=\"http://www.sinopolis.com\" target=\"_new\">Sinopolis.com</a><br><a href=\"http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/cntoc.html\" target=\"_new\">US Library of Congress Country Study: China</a><br></p>",

      "bodyText": "After months of heated debate, China's parliament has finally amended the national marriage law to deal with men who \"keep a second woman.\" An amendment to the 20-year-old marriage law, approved by the standing committee of the national people's congress, states that \"cohabitation (by a married person) with another person is prohibited.\" The change will not, by itself, bring about a sharp reduction in the second households kept by many officials and businessmen - usually in discreet suburbs outside the city limits. The legislators have drawn a distinction between bigamy, which is already punished under the criminal code, and cohabitation, which carries no such sanction. Aggrieved spouses seeking to divorce a cohabiting husband may now seek financial compensation in the civil courts - something that was not available before - but the legislators have resisted demands for cohabitation to be turned into an actual crime. \"We certainly cannot deal with all behaviour which undermines marriage by legal measures,\" says marriage law professor Wu Changzhen, who helped draft the amendment. Yet the concept of a morality that is in need of defence by society and the state still plays a much greater part in China than in the west. Ms Wu goes on to say that the measures that should be adopted include \"public opinion, moral censure and the restraint of communist party discipline.\" The problem of \"keeping a second woman\" is closely associated, and for good reasons, with the growth of corruption over the past two decades and the decline of what many still loosely refer to as \"socialist\" morality. Statistics abound to prove the point: in 95% of corruption cases in Guangdong province over recent years, it is explained, the guilty official or businessman was running a second household. The \"other woman\" factor has sometimes been exploited crudely by the official press to explain away the worst cases of massive corruption running into billions of Chinese yuan. It is also easier to focus upon an aspect of changing male sexual behaviour that is still relatively uncommon because of the financial outlay needed. Far more men regularly visit prostitutes without incurring the same censure. Yet running a second household also has a particular resonance for a society in which the memory of concubinage is still recent - and a popular theme for film and drama. It implies too that the \"feudal\" attitudes, thought to have been eradicated by the revolution, are still widespread. The first marriage law, drafted soon after the 1949 communist victory, sought with some success to establish new standards for equality between the sexes and shared responsibility for child-rearing. Yet over the Maoist decades, this emphasis upon normal family life too often became a repressive instrument, forcing unhappy couples to stay together and severely punishing sexual misbehaviour. The post-Mao reforms since 1978 have been followed, though at first more slowly, by a loosening of these political-cum-social restraints. In recent years, the pace of change has increased to a point which scandalises the old party faithful. Sexual experimentation before marriage is widely accepted and some young Chinese even opt to remain unmarried - unthinkable in the past, where staying single was regarded as deviant behaviour. Many women taking part in the debate over revisions to the law acknowledge the need to recognise that China is a more diverse society, but fear that it is also becoming more exploitative again. There were hopes that the amendments would impose tougher measures against domestic violence, which is said by the Chinese women's federation to occur in three out of 10 families and to be a factor in three-fifths of divorce cases. Yet the law still only deals with the problem in general terms. A new provision of protecting the rights of children born outside marriage is more specific, providing for financial support by the father and stipulating equal rights with those born in wedlock. Away from the Chinese cities, the effect of the new amendments will still depend upon popular acceptance - far from assured in many rural areas, where Chinese feminists complain that male attitudes are reverting to feudalism. Some would argue that the largest category of exploited women today are not wives - whether first or second - in relatively well off urban households. They are the hundreds of thousands of rural women - including thousands of under age girls - who are forced into prostitution or sexual slavery.

      "body": "<p>Imagine for a moment that you're William, a year 10 pupil who's feeling strange. Your parents have recently divorced, your mum is depressed and withdrawn and you haven't seen your dad for weeks. You feel abandoned by both of them and are desperate for attention. You've always been good at making people laugh and find yourself little by little slipping into a new persona as disruptive, underachieving clown. Other kids love it. Your teachers don't and show it by shouting, criticising and assuming the worst of you before you've even opened your mouth. </p> <p>Now imagine that you're William's maths or English teacher. Something's wrong with this boy, but you don't know what and don't have the time, energy or inclination to find out. From being occasionally silly he's become a full-blown troublemaker whose attention-seeking is a constant irritant and whose underachievement is a real worry. </p> <p>In a class of 28, William has become a thorn in your side. You've tried cajolery, threats and visits to the deputy head, but nothing seems to bother him. He's got a learning mentor who's suggested that he see the school counsellor, but the waiting list is six weeks because she only comes in twice a week. And, frankly, for one 20-minute session a week, who knows if it's going to be any use? All you know is that you can't wait to see the back of him at the end of the year. </p> <p>William's got problems and he's not the only one. There are more troubled children in mainstream schools than ever before. One in five children and adolescents experiences a mental health problem serious enough to warrant professional help, but only 10% to 20% get it. And it's not that the rest don't want help, it's just that, despite the government's drive for early intervention, it doesn't exist in their area. With the rise in the number of children displaying emotional and behavioural difficulties at school, including the worrying escalation in conduct disorder, classroom teachers have very little in their professional armoury to equip them to deal with it. </p> <p>Initial teacher training pays scant attention to child psychology and the vast majority of inset courses focus on curricular subject areas. But without the understanding, expertise or time to deal with these children, teachers can feel overwhelmed, at a loss and defeated by their demands, particularly when set against the diverse needs of the others in the classroom. </p> <p>In this new era of inclusive schools, no one can say how many children have transient or more serious mental health problems that are ignored and who instead get shouted at, sent to the head or are temporarily excluded, again and again until, finally, they never come back. </p> <p>School counselling services are very variable, says Dinah Morley, deputy director of Young Minds, the child's mental health charity. \"Some are linked up with the health authority's child and adolescent mental health services, but many are hit-and-miss with people who may be qualified counsellors, but have no training in working with children. And then there are many school nurses who take on a counselling role without any training, carrying tremendous case loads of children with mental health problems of real concern.\" </p> <p>The plethora of short, general counselling courses on the market and the absence of quality control has led, says Dorothy Eddi Piper of the Trust for the Study of Adolescence, \"to some extraordinarily badly qualified counsellors working in schools. On one course I know of, people get called counsellors after just 15 hours of training.\" In response to the increasing demands on schools, and the absence of appropriate training, Sue Kegerreis, a child and adolescent psychotherapist and school counsellor, has developed what's believed to be the first such course of its kind: an MSc in psychodynamic counselling with children and adolescents, at Birkbeck College, University of London. </p> <p>Designed for professionals working with young people - including teachers, school counsellors, social workers and youth workers - it's an intensive course that provides the insights and strategies they need to work with troubled young people within the formal structures of school. </p> <p>In contrast to the short courses for professionals working with children, the Birkbeck course, which starts in the autumn, is a demanding commitment for employers as much as for participants. It runs one day a week over a period of two years for a diploma, or three years for an MSc, with the final year on placement. In addition, students are required to go through psychotherapy themselves once a week. </p> <p>Schools and LEAs strapped for cash and staff are unlikely to be clamouring for places on such long-term and expensive training courses for counsellors, teachers and related staff. Since the introduction of local management of schools, education authorities no longer employ a pool of specialist counsellors. Instead, schools must buy in themselves, having to choose from the burgeoning market in counselling services run by voluntary and other agencies. </p> <p>Kegerreis aims to sharpen up practice by offering a course focused on how the young person interacts with the school setting as well as with their home and social environment. </p> <p>\"As well as looking at how the conscious and unconscious mind works, psychodynamic counselling is about looking at the relationships around the child and at the impact of the child on people around them,\" she says. \"It's concerned with the child in context, with what's going on around them and with finding a shared understanding with them about why they're feeling and behaving the way they are, rather than just giving them solutions.\" </p> <p>In a case like William's, for instance, psychodynamic counselling would involve the trained adult working with him to see that his disruptive, clownish behaviour was his way of communicating despair and lack of control over his life because of his parents' divorce and their withdrawal from him. </p> <p>\"If the professional just reacts to the child's aggression, it becomes part of the problem,\" says Kegerreis. </p> <p>\"If a child seems wild or out of control, you can get into a situation where you're just condemning the behaviour and can so easily miss out on the underlying problems.\" </p> <p>An important part of the Birkbeck course is the way students are put in a position of understanding what it means to be a pupil, looking at their own relationship to authority and at their own experience as learners. It's something that the increasingly pres surised \"them and us\" culture in schools, which separates professionals from pupils, doesn't allow reflection for. </p> <p>\"It gives students on the course a way of understanding more fully the kinds of things kids are experiencing with teachers, other figures of authority and their peers. It reminds them of how difficult it is to learn.\" </p> <p>Morley believes that there is, finally, \"an awakening to the realisation that children's mental health matters,\" with the growth of child and adolescent mental health services and their attempts to link up with the education sector. </p> <p>Enabling teachers and school counsellors to understand the mental health problems being played out before their eyes day in, day out, also gives them an opportunity to reclaim their professionalism. </p> <p>\"The space to think is at a terrible premium in schools,\" says Kegerreis, \"and it can be soul-destroying for teachers. If anything contributes to burn-out, it's that.\"</p>",

Justice secretary Hernando Perez also ordered the arrest of at least 11 key opposition figures today, including senators Gringo Honasan and Juan Ponce Enrile, Estrada's former spokesman Ernesto Maceda and former Philippine national police chief Panfilo Lacson. Colonel Reynaldo Berroya, police intelligence chief, said that the arrests were ordered in connection with the protests, but did not outline the accusations. At least four people were reported dead as thousands of supporters of the jailed former president skirmished with police around the presidential palace. According to police, at least 12 policemen, a newspaper photographer and 25 civilians were injured and 30 protesters were arrested. It was the second time in as many nights that Ms Arroyo survived an attempt to force her from office and reinstall Estrada. She claimed that he and his allies incensed supporters in an effort to seize power for their own benefit.

It is clear that their theme is to bring down the legitimate government so ... they would establish their own junta.\" Earlier, there were pre-dawn clashes on a 10-mile march to the presidential palace from a shrine to the 1986 revolt that toppled late dictator Ferdinand Marcos. At least two policemen were killed and scores injured as the crowd, which had been rallying for Estrada's release from custody on corruption charges, forced its way through police lines. Some officials played down the significance of the clashes. \"As far as we are concerned, this is not a large-scale rebellion or insurrection, just a rampage of mindless people who have absolutely no love for the country,\" said Renato Corona, Ms Arroyo's chief of staff. House of representatives speaker Feliciano Belmonte added: \"We will not become like Indonesia, where upheavals are non-stop.

After spending time in prison, he has been undergoing medical tests at a hospital. He was airlifted out this morning, with local TV reporting that he was transferred to a special detention centre at Santa Rosa, 40 miles south of Manila. Estrada's lawyers have sought house arrest or bail, neither of which is usually granted for plunder. Ms Arroyo has vowed to permit peaceful protest and crack down hard on efforts to destabilise her government. \"Last night, there was going to be a power grab, but it fizzled out,\" Ms Arroyo said Monday. \"I was hoping they would act so I could crush them.\" Ms Arroyo was sworn in January 20 as Estrada was packing to leave the presidential palace in the face of growing protests over the corruption allegations. He denies any wrongdoing.

Childminders are in decline (though 25% of children in paid care still go to them) but nurseries are booming, thanks to Labour. More places are in the pipeline. Enough is going on for the Daycare Trust to be thinking, not implausibly, of a childcare place for every working parent who wants one within a decade*. </p> <p>But its survey finds barely 25% of parents even know the government has a \"national childcare strategy\". One reason for childcare's low salience is fragmentation. This year the Department for Education and Employment is spending \u00a3202m on childcare but in 12 separate packages, \u00a33m for toy libraries, \u00a341m to help recruit childminders and so on. A full accounting of the public money available would also include bits of the separate \u00a3290m for providing nursery places for three- and four-year-olds in schools and the \u00a3450m children's fund giving grants to councils in poor areas. </p> <p>One reason so few parents have been shouting praise from the rooftops is administrative. In the past a major new service would have been announced with a big bang, like Lloyd George on pensions or Attlee and the health service. Labour will not do that partly because it is sensitive over accusations of centralisation, partly because it has not so far wanted to commit the huge sums necessary to create a new national service, at least not up front. An alternative might have been to force employers to do their bit. After all, productivity and profit depend on parents. Yet only 4% of them get any financial help with childcare from their firms and only 5% of companies provide a workplace nursery. </p> <p>Childcare falls between stools because the thrust of policy, so far, is redistributive - it has been about assisting lower income parents first. The \"national\" strategy is in fact sectional, with overlapping ambitions both for poorer people and the areas in which they live. The official target is a childcare place in the most disadvantaged areas for every lone parent entering employment by 2004. But the political cost of such a focus is the programme's invisibility and the non-participation of the middle classes. To realise the Daycare Trust's ambition of a \"universal coherent system based on a children's centre in every neighbourhood\" - with funding to match - is going to take middle-class involvement. More affluent parents are going to be needed both as activists and as voters to approve the large increases in public spending that would be necessary. </p> <p>We are some way off. The 725,000 places available last year serviced some 5m children under eight. The appetite for help with care is huge - children between eight and 11 could benefit mightily from an expansion of after-school-hours supervised activities. Some 58% of mothers with a child aged under five are at work and four out of 10 women of working age have dependent children. Health minister Yvette Cooper was extolling the government's maternity arrangements on these pages yesterday. But as more women return to work after maternity leave, shortfalls in childcare places become more apparent. </p> <p>Still, the number of economically active women whose youngest child is aged less than four rose from 48% to 58% over the decade to last year. Childcare places did expand under the Tories. But in many families it is granny and neighbours who paper over the cracks. Some 70% of work ing women with dependent children make \"informal arrangements\" for all or part of their childcare. Childcare outside the home is used by 13% of parents all the time and by a further 8% in combination with friends and family. </p> <p>Labour has wanted to expand employment as its principal anti-poverty measure. The working families' tax credit (WFTC) is part of the armoury and is meant to contribute to the cost of childcare. WFTC childcare averages \u00a333.48 a week, a long way short of the England average of \u00a388.87 for childminding, let alone the \u00a3110.49 for a nursery place. </p> <p>Meanwhile, in another neck of the woods, women ministers, notably Margaret Hodge and Tessa Jowell, with effective lobbying from former social security secretary Harriet Harman, have tried to expand the local supply of places. A total of 1.6m is promised by 2004 - meaning at the very least that the next three years are going to see terrific expansion of employment in this area. That must mean more training and better payment. </p> <p>It is at this point that the lack of \"strategy\" shows. Is state-supported childcare a welfare state graft, a new arm on an old body? Open acknowledgment that this is the expansion of collective provision would raise the political stakes but might improve chances of the money being found. Childcare helps families and probably children, too - getting children out of their homes is a key aim for the parallel Sure Start programme for the disadvantaged. </p> <p>There is only one subsidised childcare place for every 14 children under three who are living in poverty. But, paradoxically, the best way to provide for them might be to create children's centres in every neighbourhood.

Her daughter was born last July and will be three by the time her mother is eligible for parole in July 2002. Two other Styal prisoners, J and K, have cases pending. Mr Gordon said fundamental rights were at stake. The rigid \"arbitrary, irrational and discriminatory\" policy of removing babies at 18 months prevented the assessment of cases on their individual merits. The across the board policy was contrary to the European convention on human rights because it interfered with a prisoner's right to family life. \"The importance of the mother-child attachment is self-evident and should be preserved if at all possible,\" Mr Gordon said. \"There is clear parliamentary intent that children in need shall receive a full assessment of their need.\" Lawyers for the Home Office are expected to argue that the home secretary, Jack Straw, has developed a policy which allows mothers to look after young children, while protecting older children from the damaging experience of prison.",

      "bodyText": "A fantasy football website that launched last summer in a blaze of publicity has gone into voluntary liquidation with debts of \u00a33m. Premierwin.com, which offered a \u00a31m first prize and \u00a3100,000 to the runner-up, said it hoped to be able to pay out to the winners at the end of the season. A spokesman for the liquidator ,Parker Wood, said the \u00a31.1m main prize money had been placed in an escrow protecting the prize money. \"It is hoped the site will continue to run for team changes to enable participants to continue to play,\" a statement posted on the premierwin.com website said. Premierwin.com will not be able to pay the outstanding \u00a31,000 weekly and \u00a35,000 monthly prizes it promised, according to the website statement. The statistics on the site, which are supplied by Opta, have not been updated since the end of March. The last entry in the premierwin.com monthly winner's gallery is from January. The Parker Wood spokesman said a number of factors had contributed to premierwin.com's failure. \"They weren't able to generate enough sponsorship money and they didn't attract enough players - in part due to early administrative difficulties,\" he added. \"The company also had very high running costs and a huge advertising spend.\" Premierwin.com signed a deal with national commercial radio station TalkSport to promote the website. The agreement involved a weekly announcement of premierwin.com winners on Alan Brazil's TalkSport breakfast show. But the Parker Wood spokesman said this arrangement had already come to an end, adding that TalkSport had been \"pre-paid\" as part of the agreement. He said the current intention was for a premierwin.com winner to be announced through TalkSport within 90 days of the end of the football season. It was also hoped the publicity generated by the announcement of the two winners can be used to create interest in the sale of premierwin.com's assets. These include the domain name, data-base - which is estimated to include the 17-18,000 competitors who signed up for premierwin.com - and the game format. The Parker Wood spokesman said a number of interested parties had been in contact with the liquidator about buying premierwin.com's assets. \"The company has gone but we think it's a good concept and believe people will want to learn from this and create a successful operation, \" he added. He said a shareholder owning 52% of the company behind premierwin.com, Football Manager Limited, had invested \u00a32.38m in the internet venture, including the \u00a31.1m for the two main prizes. This backer did not want their identity revealed, he added. The other major creditors include software company Systems for Windows, which inputted all the football results data, and marketing outfit Advanced Response Marketing Direct, the spokesman said. Opta, which supplied the results data, is also owed a smaller amount of money, he added. The spokesman said because premierwin.com had outsourced its operations, there would be relatively few job losses.

      "bodyText": "The BBC enjoyed a stunning night of success at the 2001 Sony Radio Academy Awards last night, with its stations, programmes and presenters picking up 23 of the 30 main prizes. Even by the corporation's own standards - the BBC usually does better than its commercial rivals at TV and radio awards ceremonies despite not necessarily being more popular ratings-wise - it was a good night. Last night's BBC awards haul was six above last year's total of 17. The commercial radio sector mustered only seven Sonys last night. BBC Radio 4 led the way for the corporation with six awards, including a special Sony award for the Food Programme creator and presenter, Derek Cooper, who was honoured \"for his pioneering work as one of the first journalists to take the subject of food seriously\". Radio 2 bagged five Sonys, including the prestigious national station of the year award, which last year went to Classic FM. \"Over the last 12 months Radio 2's development has continued apace,\" the Sony judges said, \"and its online presence in particular, has come to play a significant part alongside the station's audio appeal.\" Other Radio 2 winners included A Beginner's Guide to Reggae, presented by Mark Lamarr, for best specialist music show; and Stuart Maconie, who beat off competition from Henry Kelly and the Dreem Teem to be voted best music broadcaster by the Sony judges. BBC regional and local stations came away with seven Sonys, including three for The Jon Gaunt Breakfast Show, from BBC Three Counties Radio. The show was honoured for breaking the news of the closure of the Vauxhall car plant in Luton and staying with the story for the following 24 hours. The Jon Gaunt Breakfast Show came away with the Sony news coverage award and the breakfast award for a news and talk show. Mr Gaunt also beat off competition from BBC Radio 4's Eddie Mair and Radio 5 Live's Peter Allen and Victoria Derbyshire to be named radio news broadcaster of the year. On a night of slim pickings for the commercial sector, Heart 100.7 FM's Daryl Denham snuck past Kiss 100's Bam Bam and Radio 2's Terry Wogan to secure the breakfast music show award. And Murf Media, a Sheffield-based independent radio producer, saw off Radio 2's Jonathan Ross Show and Radio 1's Mark Radcliffe Show to take the entertainment award for its Bitz and Pieces CD show for selected Emap and local stations.

While there are other hostels in Manchester for young people to turn to, this high support project is designed to help those 16 to 21-year-olds most at risk from life on the streets.</p> <p>But the trust's work does not stop with emergency night shelters.

At present more than 70% of young people released from young offender institutions will re-offend. The Depaul Trust is working with this group to help them break out of the cycle of crime and despair.</p> <p>The Outside Link project is based in Feltham, Middlesex. It targets young offenders who have little or no support \"on the outside\". The project's specialist advice worker then helps them to forge links with support networks in the community and helps them overcome immediate problems with accommodation.</p> <p>Through its one to one project, the trust recruits volunteer mentors from the local community to befriend young offenders before they are released. With the help of a caring adult mentor young offenders can gain a new confidence in their futures.</p> <p>Employment issues are a key concern for the Depaul Trust. The Next Step project is a good example of its work. Established last January, it aims to provide jobs for young people who have been socially excluded by long-term employment. </p> <p>The project has set up a furniture store. This involves finding old furniture, storing it, and transporting it to the charity's furniture restoration project - Step Ahead II - based in the Wirral. Training is given in furniture restoration and the young people can take an HGV driving course. Both can lead to full-time employment.</p> <p>The Community Development project has recently been established in east Newcastle. It works with 16 to 25-year-olds who have few other opportunities. One way this scheme aims to help is by establishing a credit union to help young people learn to budget and save money. It is also planning to run a training scheme in sports coaching.</p> <p>The Depaul Trust is a diverse organisation. Then again, the problems and issues faced by disadvantaged young people across the country are also diverse. In this sense the trust is responsive. It reacts to poverty, deprivation and despair faced by young people by offering opportunities and hope.</p>",

It targets young offenders who have little or no support \"on the outside\". The project's specialist advice worker then helps them to forge links with support networks in the community and helps them overcome immediate problems with accommodation. Through its one to one project, the trust recruits volunteer mentors from the local community to befriend young offenders before they are released. With the help of a caring adult mentor young offenders can gain a new confidence in their futures. Employment issues are a key concern for the Depaul Trust. The Next Step project is a good example of its work. Established last January, it aims to provide jobs for young people who have been socially excluded by long-term employment. The project has set up a furniture store. This involves finding old furniture, storing it, and transporting it to the charity's furniture restoration project - Step Ahead II - based in the Wirral. Training is given in furniture restoration and the young people can take an HGV driving course. Both can lead to full-time employment. The Community Development project has recently been established in east Newcastle. It works with 16 to 25-year-olds who have few other opportunities. One way this scheme aims to help is by establishing a credit union to help young people learn to budget and save money. It is also planning to run a training scheme in sports coaching. The Depaul Trust is a diverse organisation. Then again, the problems and issues faced by disadvantaged young people across the country are also diverse. In this sense the trust is responsive. It reacts to poverty, deprivation and despair faced by young people by offering opportunities and hope.",

Armed with samurai swords and machetes, supported by the Real IRA, bolstered by hordes of asylum seekers, the protesters gathering in some of London's most famous streets threaten to bring life as we know it to an end. The police have been releasing pictures of the terrifying looking people whom, they say, have been waiting to pounce upon innocent Londoners since the chaotic protests on May Day last year.</p> <p>All this, of course, is about as likely as a Tory victory in June. The police are seeking to persuade us that unless they receive extra resources we'll all be murdered in our beds, while some newspapers appear to be using the threat of minor mayhem as a means of delegitimising all protest, violent or otherwise. But while most of the past week's reports are absurd, there's little doubt that some parts of the protest movement have changed.</p> <p>Four or five years ago, video newsreels such as Undercurrents and Conscious Cinema broadcast heroic images of peaceful campaigners being dragged away and beaten up by police. Today the means of instruction have changed. Crowd Bites Wolf, a commemoration of last September's protests in Prague, produced by a collective called Guerillavision, celebrates anarchist attacks on police lines, including a firebombing in which a policeman - who had not been issued with fireproof clothing - was severely burned. Another sequence frames a police helmet as if it were a target in a video game, before the helmet is struck by a rock and its occupant collapses.</p> <p>This is a fetishisation of violence, a sadistic pornography of pain. A few years ago it would have been furiously dismissed. Today I am sure that the great majority of activists are privately horrified by these images. But they appear to have lost the will to speak out.</p> <p>It's not hard to see why. While funny, inclusive, colourful events, organised by women as well as men, still take place all over the country, some of the key planning meetings for the big demonstrations have become dominated by a handful of aggressive and overbearing men. People questioning their plans are dismissed as \"reformists\" or \"middle-class wankers\". Inverted snobbery (articulated in some cases by men whose estuary accents come and go as the occasion demands) has become a powerful weapon against competing ideologies.</p> <p>A few months ago, one of Reclaim the Streets' most prominent activists arrived at a meeting to discover that he had been branded a heretic. A list of his sins (such as speaking to the media) was read out, then he was excommunicated. When conflicting voices have been driven away and the remaining participants cowed, the organisers claim that they have achieved a consensus built on \"direct democracy\".</p> <p>The result is that non-violent direct action has gradually been displaced by anything-goes direct action. Though the physically and psychologically powerful people who hector the doubters at some of the meetings impose their will on everyone else, they argue that it is undemocratic to decide how the group as a whole should behave. If some people want to be violent, that's up to them. While nearly all the protesters opposing globalisation, corporations and environmental destruction are peaceful, they - or perhaps I should say we - have become reluctant to demand that our movement abides by the principles of non-violence. We call upon the world to exercise collective responsibility for the state of the planet. Yet we seem unprepared to exercise collective responsibility for the state of our own movement.</p> <p>The advocates of violence insist that their aggression is insignificant by comparison to the violence of global capitalism. This is true, but it's hard to see how it could be construed as a justification. I have heard activists condemn the continued bombing of Iraq on the grounds that violence of this kind will only hurt the people it is supposed to protect, then go on to advocate attacking the police as a means of saving the world. If, as they argue, advanced capitalism is the most violent of all political systems, then violent conflict with that system is surely doomed to fail.</p> <p>They, who also maintain that activists shouldn't talk to the press, now seek to justify violence by insisting that it is the only form of protest the media will report. There is some truth in this, but part of the reason why peaceful protest is seldom covered is that the media now expect to see bloodshed, and judges the newsworthiness of the event accordingly. The cycle blockades, the peaceful actions outside corporate headquarters, the cardboard city being built by homelessness activists on Park Lane, the demos taking place in Swansea, Bristol, Brighton, Birmingham, Dudley, Manchester, Sheffield, Newcastle and Glasgow today, will all be blotted out of the public consciousness by images of violence.</p> <p>Even if one were to accept the legitimacy of violence in principle, it must also be clear that it's seldom the perpetrators of global injustice who get hurt. The only victims of rock throwing and petrol bombing are the police, passers-by and other protesters (after four cans of Special Brew no one seems able to tell the difference). By masking up and refusing to be held accountable for their actions, violent protesters provide cover for any skinhead or agent provocateur who wants either to discredit the movement or use someone else's demo as an excuse for a ruck.</p> <p>Violent activists are stealing the political space which peaceful protesters have worked so hard to secure. They are squandering the goodwill we have accumulated, the burgeoning public demand for radical change which will disappear or find another outlet if we cannot mobilise it within the next couple of years. Like the police, they compress our protests both physically and politically, lumping us together with them in the public mind, ensuring that our peaceful actions are broken up with baton charges. Violence is our enemy, yet we refuse to treat it as such.</p> <p>Confronting violent protest requires far more physical and moral courage than throwing rocks at the police. It means standing up to the bullies who seek to corral and dominate some of our meetings. It means seeking, as some brave souls have done during international protests, both to remove the sticks and stones from the hands of masked-up class warriors and to stand between them and the police. We're likely to be harangued and vilified, perhaps even beaten up by both sides. But if we think we're big enough to stand up to globalisation, we're surely big enough to stand up to a handful of its opponents.</p> <p>If violence holds sway, it will deliver the movement into the hands of its enemies. Many protesters have argued that seeking to tackle it would be divisive. But if we can't divide ourselves from violence, then violence will divide us from society.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",

The secretary of state, John Reid, says this burst of honesty signals a new openness. We hope that it signals not only that - but a new maturity, too.",

The information commission - an official watchdog - told the Guardian that the system, due to be launched next month by the Lord Chancellor's Department, could become unworkable because of the error-riddled police information that might allow previous offenders to slip the net.

Harry Fletcher, Napo's assistant general secretary, said: \"I am amazed that department after department is going to be relying on the PNC because of what we know. They have to put this new scheme on hold or they are going to end up with people on juries who have all sorts of convictions.\" The scale of the PNC's shortcomings is overwhelming. Every two years, the Metropolitan police conducts an unannounced audit of the PNC information. The last audit, between January and April 1999, found \"wholly unacceptable\" levels of inaccuracy. The overall error rate was 86%, an increase of 34% on the previous audit in 1997. According to the Met report, 85% of those errors were, being \"those that could lead to serious consequences with the possibility of financial compensation to those affected\". In a nationwide study of PNC data last year, the chief inspector of constabulary found an error rate of between 15% and 65%, with substantial delays in updating records. The report concluded: \"Overall, the level and nature of errors, omissions and discrepancies found were unacceptable.\" Police forces have complained that they do not have the resources to keep the PNC data up to date, or to train officers on data input. Deficiencies in PNC data are already the source of serious concern about the new criminal records bureau, which will use the information to allow employers to vet applicants wanting to work with children. The bureau should start work in July, but earlier this month the Commons home affairs committee urged the government to postpone the launch amid doubts about the quality of PNC data. A spokeswoman for the department admitted the police data was not ideal but said the new system would mean vetting that was more thorough than random manual checks.",

      "bodyText": "German leaders of both left and right made it clear yesterday that they were backing an all-out push for the political integration of Europe by the end of the decade. The text of a document drawn up under the guidance of the chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, showed that he was aiming for the key decisions on the continent's future to be taken within the next 10 years. It also showed that Mr Schr\u00f6der and his fellow Social Democrats see it as essential to harmonise taxes in the European Union: a policy which is anathema to both the main parties in Britain and to governments in some other EU states. The document, which was leaked at the weekend, was unveiled at a press conference in Berlin by the general secretary of Mr Schr\u00f6der's Social Democratic party, Franz M\u00fcnterfering. \"The debate must begin urgently, even if everyone does not agree on everything,\" he said. He and other senior Social Democrats will get their first opportunity to lobby for their ideas at a meeting of the pan-European Party of European Socialists in Berlin on Monday. Mr M\u00fcnterfering presented the scheme as an attempt to democratise the workings of the EU, and the German opposition seized on this aspect to welcome it. \"We have a democratic deficit in the EU and that must change,\" the leader of the Christian Democrat Union (CDU), Angela Merkel, said . Mr Schr\u00f6der expressed delight at the reaction of the opposition conservatives, describing it as \"great\". At the heart of his plan is a transformation of the European commission, the union's unelected executive. \"We want the EU commission from now [on] to be strengthened to become a government - a real European government beside the national governments,\" the SPD's chief spokesman, Michael Donnermeyer, said. Many of the details of the plan, which is to be put before the SPD's conference in November, have yet to be defined. In essence, senior SPD sources said yesterday, the chancellor would like a set-up similar to that in Germany with the considerable powers of the states serving as a model for the future powers of nation states. But it remains unclear, for example, how the proposed European government would be chosen, and whether its leader would be elected by one or both of the chambers in a new, two-tier legislature. While the document contains several nods in the direction of preserving national identities, it is emphatic that the SPD wants a pan-continental structure to emerge from talks on the future of Europe due to begin in 2004. \"There is no alternative to further integration and Europeanisation\", the paper declares. Its key passage is set out in the language of cast-iron inevitability: \"In 10 years we shall live in a Europe with a constitution. In 10 years, we shall live in a Europe with a [single] currency\". The document argues that \"an internal market and a common currency demand more energetic harmonisation of fiscal policy, especially with regard to taxes on business, the taxation of capital gains, the taxation of investment in energy and the organisation of value added and corporation tax\". If that is enough to provoke apoplexy among some British MPs, then there are plenty of other passages able to incite an angry reaction elsewhere in the community.

Judge Baltasar Garzon, the investigating magistrate who tried to extradite the former Chilean dictator General Augusto Pinochet from Britain, is investigating allegations that Mr Berlusconi broke Spanish media laws restricting ownership to 25% of any television channel and defrauded Spain of \u00a34m in tax. Prosecutors have claimed that Mr Berlusconi actually owned between 52% and 80% of the channel. El Mundo alleges that he abused this illegal dominant holding to drain the channel's funds and boost Fininvest. \"Fininvest overshot the limit on ownership... using front companies and third countries to simulate fictitious holdings and deliberately mislead ministries,\" the prosecuting state attorneys have claimed. Judge Garzon has been trying for eight months to get the European parliament to lift Mr Berlusconi's immunity as an MEP. But there is no chance of this happening before the Italian elections. The opinion polls show that his centre-right House of Liberties coalition is the clear favourite to win. Fininvest said yesterday that El Mundo's accusation were \"not only totally unfounded and defamatory but also totally lacking in logic and common sense\". It said in a statement issued in Milan that Mr Berlusconi headed so many companies that he could not possibly be expected to know the minute details of each of them. It confirmed that some of the companies cited by El Mundo formed part of the group, but others were not,\"as has been clearly demonstrated to Spanish government authorities\".",

But yesterday it emerged that, under a convertible bond issue used to finance the purchase of 25% of SLEC earlier this year, Kirch has the right to become the dominant partner, taking its stake in SLEC from 37.5% to 57.5%. EM.TV's stake would fall to 17.5%. </p> <p>EM.TV said that both sides wanted to see the Kirch stake increased though Kirch itself was more cautious, saying that no decision had been taken. </p> <p>The news comes shortly after a row over TV coverage of the sport which Kirch has sought to diffuse with assurances that formula one would remain available on terrestrial television. The formula one teams had previously threatened to set up their own cham pionship if coverage was moved from terrestrial television, where it attracts huge audiences and advertising, to pay-TV. </p> <p>Yesterday EM.TV, where Kirch in turn has a 16.74% stake, said that it was taking a DM1.3bn (\u00a3412m) write-down against the original SLEC stake and a further DM684m write-down against its purchase of Muppets maker, the Jim Henson Company. </p> <p>The write-downs pushed the Munich based group DM2.8bn into the red in 2000 - more than double its total turnover for the year. </p> <p>Chief executive Thomas Haffa said the results marked the end of the company's difficulties. \"We've cleaned up our numbers without mercy. This is very painful but with this we are creating a basis for the future of EM.TV,\" he said. </p> <p>The company is still considering what to do with the Jim Henson Company. \"It may be a complete sale or it may be a strategic partner,\" a spokeswoman said yesterday. </p> <p>However, EM.TV is believed to prefer a strategic partner as that would allow it to keep distribution rights. </p> <p>EM.TV shares rose more than 8% to \u20ac5.68 (\u00a33.52).</p>",

The news comes shortly after a row over TV coverage of the sport which Kirch has sought to diffuse with assurances that formula one would remain available on terrestrial television. The formula one teams had previously threatened to set up their own cham pionship if coverage was moved from terrestrial television, where it attracts huge audiences and advertising, to pay-TV. Yesterday EM.TV, where Kirch in turn has a 16.74% stake, said that it was taking a DM1.3bn (\u00a3412m) write-down against the original SLEC stake and a further DM684m write-down against its purchase of Muppets maker, the Jim Henson Company. The write-downs pushed the Munich based group DM2.8bn into the red in 2000 - more than double its total turnover for the year. Chief executive Thomas Haffa said the results marked the end of the company's difficulties. \"We've cleaned up our numbers without mercy. This is very painful but with this we are creating a basis for the future of EM.TV,\" he said. The company is still considering what to do with the Jim Henson Company. \"It may be a complete sale or it may be a strategic partner,\" a spokeswoman said yesterday. However, EM.TV is believed to prefer a strategic partner as that would allow it to keep distribution rights. EM.TV shares rose more than 8% to \u20ac5.68 (\u00a33.52).",

      "bodyText": "The Periodical Publishers Association has strengthened its interactive division by appointing FT.com's Michael Murphy as chairman. Mr Murphy takes over from Julian Treasure, who has served as PPAi chairman for the last two years and who will remain on the PPAi council. The appointment of Mr Murphy, chief operating officer of FT.com, comes at a time of expansion for the interactive division. It wants to set more targeted goals for interactive publishing, improve its website and expand into new areas, such as research and training. Mr Murphy will work with other magazine publishing chiefs, such as Helen Alexander of the Economist Group, Julian Turner of beeb ventures and Roger Green of Emap. His priorities as PPAi chairman will be to push for an industry-wide standard for site metrics and auditing standards, as well as developing ways of making content pay online - something also top of his own list at FT.com. \"PPAi has an important role to play in the internet publishing industry,\" said Mr Murphy. \"These are exciting times for the sector and I am delighted to be playing a key role in driving the industry forward.\" The PPAi was set up as an offshoot of the PPA two years ago in order to educate and bring publishers online. It meets four times a year and will meet later this month to discuss e-commerce practices, web traffic measurement and auditing.",

      "bodyText": "The debacle of the Leeds United trial and the resignation of the Sunday Mirror editor, Colin Myler, brought a remarkable twist of fate for Tina Weaver. The way something begins often reveals the seeds of its future, so will her editorship of the Sunday Mirror be subject to the same lawless upsets? The good news is Ms Weaver takes over at a time when her horoscope (June 17 1965) is on a lucky Jupiter high and nothing could indicate more strikingly that she just happened to be in the right place at the right time. Ms Weaver is a streetwise, networking Gemini, a sign perfectly at home in the fast, shifting world of the press and ideal for a media queen with a tabloid background. She has all the smartness of the Gemini twins, coupled with the toughness of aggressive Mars square to her Sun in the hard-working sign of Virgo. This can make her highly strung and prone to sudden, ratty arguments when she is stressed out. Astrologer Isabelle Pagan says of this Gemini quality: \"There is always a strong desire to be 'in the running' and in the very centre of things; and if these people find themselves in any way inferior to those around them - and are consequently compelled to take a back seat - they feel very sore and ill-used - and show it.\" (From Pioneer to Poet). Her big rival on the Sundays is Rebekah Wade at News of the World and, as the only women editors left in the nationals, comparisons are inevitable. Since Ms Wade is another magpie Gemini (May 27 1968), we can expect fun and \"coincidences\" as these two second-guess each other's headline-grabbing moves. There is, however, a huge difference between them. Ms Weaver's horoscope is not fully typical of Gemini because it contains gallons of emotional water, giving her a strongly humane touch and making her super-sensitive to other people's needs. This high level of compassion for the suffering of others is not common in horoscopes connected to the tabloids - Ms Wade has no water at all - but it seems to motivate Ms Weaver more than outsiders might imagine. Her watery Venus in Cancer gives her a populist, caring instinct and tunes her in to the human interest side of any story, with such scoops as the Blairs' baby and Michael Jackson's marriage. This fits well with the Sunday Mirror - the paper is a watery Pisces with origins in the Sunday Pictorial (March 14 1915) - but it does mean Ms Weaver can go soft at the wrong moment. As she goes with the flow it will be difficult for her to forge the distinct identity the paper now needs. She has no planets in fire so, although she can pull off Gemini tricks, taking risks and playing a dangerous game does not suit her and Ms Wade beats her hands down in the dare-devil department. Enter Piers Morgan. Although he has a watery Pisces moon, he is a fiery, courageous Aries with a pioneering spirit that makes up for Ms Weaver's missing fire. The astrology suggests she will need support from his nerves of steel, especially when she hits her first Saturn crisis this August and when self-doubt and panic over the ABC figures affect her adversely and test her authority in August 2002. When the going gets tough, Geminis get going, usually as far away as possible from the trouble. This is the Peter Pan sign that wants to stay forever young and forever foolish and, often, just at the point of achieving what they want, their innate duality makes the Twins question whether they do want it after all. For Ms Weaver, the either/or, hot/cold Gemini games are over; the main astrological connection between her and the Sunday Mirror puts weighty, heavy-duty Saturn onto her Sun. It's the call of destiny and the test is whether she has the gravitas to carry it off. Email the Media Medium at maggie@companyguide.co.uk",

      "body": "<p>Rioters went on the rampage tonight as London's May Day protest finally escalated into violence.</p> <p>As darkness fell, a group of hard core demonstrators turned their attention to the busy and unguarded Tottenham Court Road area.</p> <p>Militant anarchists intent on violence broke away from peaceful demonstrators and left a trail of destruction.</p> <p>More than 20 shopfront windows on the road were smashed with rocks and other missiles, including those of Bank of Scotland, Abbey National, Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays Bank, Coffee Republic and Habitat.</p> <p>The rioters also attempted to set fire to a Tesco store on nearby Goodge Street.</p> <p>Staff were in the store at the time. One said: \"I was working downstairs when the manager told us to stay down because the shop was being attacked.</p> <p>\"We stayed down for about 20 minutes and then they said we should all go because we were being evacuated.\" Scotland Yard said about 50 to 60 of the protesters contained in the Oxford Circus area had broken away into Oxford Street at about 8.30pm.</p> <p>\"They regrouped very quickly and overturned a car. They tried to set fire to Tesco's in Goodge Street,\" a spokesman said. \"Some of those were arrested. Tension in the area remains high.\"</p> <p>Nearby Goodge Street tube station was closed by British Transport Police after the attack and Tottenham Court Road tube was also reported to be shut.</p> <p>Police in riot gear this afternoon penned several thousand anti-capitalism protesters into Oxford Circus in central London as several further groups of May Day protesters attempted to break through police lines in the area.</p> <p>The capital's May Day protests became tense as police formed human barricades to prevent groups of demonstrators from converging on Oxford Street. Surrounding side streets were cordoned off.</p> <p>Although the protest has been largely peaceful, there have been some skirmishes, with bottles and cans thrown at police. Riot police have surged forward on several occasions, batting protesters with shields and batons. Shops closed their doors and boarded up windows. Several demonstrators have emerged from scuffles covered with blood.</p> <p>Some 50 demonstrators have been arrested in today's protests across the capital, seven of them \"foreign nationals\", police said. Fifteen people have been injured in the skirmishes, 10 of whom were taken to hospital, according to the London ambulance service.</p> <p>Riot police are not allowing anyone into or out of the intersection of Oxford Street and Regent Street. A repeated police announcement to protesters said: \"You are being detained here to prevent a breach of the peace and criminal damage to property. You will be released in due course.\"</p> <p>Two protesters who climbed on to a balcony of the John Lewis building in Holles Street ripped two CCTV cameras from their mounts and passed them down into the crowd. They also stripped metal segments from the balcony and passed them down into the crowd where people appeared to be trying to smash John Lewis windows.</p> <p>Meanwhile police mounted a series of charges on Oxford Street as they came under a hail of bottles from protesters attempting to join other campaigners in Oxford Circus.</p> <p>One demonstrator managed to kick in the windows of the disused C&amp;A building after climbing the balcony running around the building.</p> <p>Police charged again as protective chipboard hoardings were ripped off the front of a Wallis shop.</p> <p>Members of the public who were not involved in the demonstrations were told by police to leave the Oxford Street area and the Tube station was closed at police request.</p> <p><b>Wombles lead protests</b></p> <p>Meanwile, a group of 600 to 1,000 people has slipped around the police lines to the north side of Oxford Circus. The group was led by around 40 \"Wombles\", protesters dressed in white overalls and padding.</p> <p>In Holles Street, beside the John Lewis department store, protesters broke through police lines several times to join up with another group of demonstrators.</p> <p>Demonstrators have complained that there is no water and no toilets inside the cordon, with some protesters pointing to police and saying, \"They're the urinals.\"</p> <p>Earlier in the afternoon, before the atmosphere became aggressive, the May Day demonstrators in Oxford Circus chanted and sang in front of front of shops such as Niketown that were closed and protected by wooden hoardings. The protestors threw Monopoly money into the air.</p> <p><b>Nike store targeted</b></p> <p>Police later faced a hail of bricks from close range and pushed protesters back into Oxford Circus. Demonstrators also attempted to break the windows of the Niketown store by hurling bricks but the windows held. A protester on stilts approached a police cameraman perched on a lamppost outside Niketown and began filming him amid cheers from the crowd.</p> <p>The demonstrators have accused the police of fuelling tension by surrounding groups of anti-capitalism protesters at various locations in central London.</p> <p><b>Protests around capital</b></p> <p>While the main body of the protest converged on Oxford Circus, at the Elephant and Castle roundabout in south-east London, two groups of demonstrators - one cyclists and the other an environmental group with a pedal-powered sound system - met. The atmosphere was carnival-like and there were many different groups.</p> <p>Sebastian Martineau, a member of the Dangerous Anarchist League, who was wearing a green uniform complete with padded armour, elongated ears and two small horns on his forehead said: \"We are just protesting.

      "bodyText": "Rioters went on the rampage tonight as London's May Day protest finally escalated into violence. As darkness fell, a group of hard core demonstrators turned their attention to the busy and unguarded Tottenham Court Road area. Militant anarchists intent on violence broke away from peaceful demonstrators and left a trail of destruction. More than 20 shopfront windows on the road were smashed with rocks and other missiles, including those of Bank of Scotland, Abbey National, Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays Bank, Coffee Republic and Habitat. The rioters also attempted to set fire to a Tesco store on nearby Goodge Street. Staff were in the store at the time. One said: \"I was working downstairs when the manager told us to stay down because the shop was being attacked. \"We stayed down for about 20 minutes and then they said we should all go because we were being evacuated.\" Scotland Yard said about 50 to 60 of the protesters contained in the Oxford Circus area had broken away into Oxford Street at about 8.30pm. \"They regrouped very quickly and overturned a car. They tried to set fire to Tesco's in Goodge Street,\" a spokesman said. \"Some of those were arrested. Tension in the area remains high.\" Nearby Goodge Street tube station was closed by British Transport Police after the attack and Tottenham Court Road tube was also reported to be shut. Police in riot gear this afternoon penned several thousand anti-capitalism protesters into Oxford Circus in central London as several further groups of May Day protesters attempted to break through police lines in the area. The capital's May Day protests became tense as police formed human barricades to prevent groups of demonstrators from converging on Oxford Street. Surrounding side streets were cordoned off. Although the protest has been largely peaceful, there have been some skirmishes, with bottles and cans thrown at police. Riot police have surged forward on several occasions, batting protesters with shields and batons. Shops closed their doors and boarded up windows. Several demonstrators have emerged from scuffles covered with blood. Some 50 demonstrators have been arrested in today's protests across the capital, seven of them \"foreign nationals\", police said. Fifteen people have been injured in the skirmishes, 10 of whom were taken to hospital, according to the London ambulance service. Riot police are not allowing anyone into or out of the intersection of Oxford Street and Regent Street. A repeated police announcement to protesters said: \"You are being detained here to prevent a breach of the peace and criminal damage to property. You will be released in due course.\" Two protesters who climbed on to a balcony of the John Lewis building in Holles Street ripped two CCTV cameras from their mounts and passed them down into the crowd. They also stripped metal segments from the balcony and passed them down into the crowd where people appeared to be trying to smash John Lewis windows. Meanwhile police mounted a series of charges on Oxford Street as they came under a hail of bottles from protesters attempting to join other campaigners in Oxford Circus. One demonstrator managed to kick in the windows of the disused C&amp;A building after climbing the balcony running around the building. Police charged again as protective chipboard hoardings were ripped off the front of a Wallis shop. Members of the public who were not involved in the demonstrations were told by police to leave the Oxford Street area and the Tube station was closed at police request. Wombles lead protests Meanwile, a group of 600 to 1,000 people has slipped around the police lines to the north side of Oxford Circus. The group was led by around 40 \"Wombles\", protesters dressed in white overalls and padding. In Holles Street, beside the John Lewis department store, protesters broke through police lines several times to join up with another group of demonstrators. Demonstrators have complained that there is no water and no toilets inside the cordon, with some protesters pointing to police and saying, \"They're the urinals.\" Earlier in the afternoon, before the atmosphere became aggressive, the May Day demonstrators in Oxford Circus chanted and sang in front of front of shops such as Niketown that were closed and protected by wooden hoardings. The protestors threw Monopoly money into the air. Nike store targeted Police later faced a hail of bricks from close range and pushed protesters back into Oxford Circus. Demonstrators also attempted to break the windows of the Niketown store by hurling bricks but the windows held. A protester on stilts approached a police cameraman perched on a lamppost outside Niketown and began filming him amid cheers from the crowd. The demonstrators have accused the police of fuelling tension by surrounding groups of anti-capitalism protesters at various locations in central London. Protests around capital While the main body of the protest converged on Oxford Circus, at the Elephant and Castle roundabout in south-east London, two groups of demonstrators - one cyclists and the other an environmental group with a pedal-powered sound system - met. The atmosphere was carnival-like and there were many different groups. Sebastian Martineau, a member of the Dangerous Anarchist League, who was wearing a green uniform complete with padded armour, elongated ears and two small horns on his forehead said: \"We are just protesting. It is important that people come along.\" Nick Wrack said: \"The day is a good carnival atmosphere, people came to demonstrate against global capitalism and the destruction of the environment - and it is their right to do so.\" He added that the police presence was completely unnecessary. The police ringed the traffic island as the demonstration was about to move on, and it turned into a rally as a spokesman told the protesters that it was their right to demonstrate in central London, but they should be aware of provoking any violence. The police then moved the demonstrators off the traffic island and through back streets to the north bank of the Thames. Activists have staged demonstrations at a variety of places in the capital today, including Trafalgar Square and Euston. Cyclists start day of action Today's demonstrations in the capital began early today with a mass cycle ride through the City to King's Cross station. Following the two Critical Mass bike rides, hundreds of protesters gathered in Euston station plaza were corralled by police and searched before they were allowed to leave. One of the marchers, Mick Gordon, from Cambridge, said he believed the police actions had led to an escalating feeling of tension among the crowd. \"I'm appalled by the police's behaviour in this situation. They seem to be turning this peaceful process into a potentially dangerous situation by penning people in.\" By lunchtime the independent website IndyMedia reported that police had surrounded Trafalgar Square, blocking in protesters who had been feeding the pigeons, which is now banned. The demonstration has so far been peaceful, with Sir David Howard, the Lord Mayor of London, reporting a \"carnival atmosphere\" as the first cyclists set off from Liverpool Street station at 8am. Professor Kayoss, of the Save The World Club, who was attending the demonstration, said that he hoped the day would pass without violent clashes. \"Thousands of people want to just protest without violence and show some kind of statement about what they feel is happening to the planet,\" he said. Police prepare for May Day The Metropolitan police chief, Sir John Stevens, today ruled out the use of plastic bullets, despite police intelligence estimates that around 1,000 activists were intent on causing trouble. He also denied suggestions that police would be armed with CS gas but said it would be \"much more likely\" that officers would have their own individual sprays. This year police fear Oxford Street could be the flashpoint for violence after pamphlets were found urging demonstrators to gather there. Intelligence suggested that all protest groups intended to meet during the rush hour to target shops and restaurants. The 6,000 police who have been drafted in for the day have been briefed to take a \"zero tolerance\" approach to avoid last year's chaotic scenes in Westminster. The country's top policeman today said he was \"praying\" for a non-violent May Day protest as thousands of anti-capitalism demonstrators prepared to take to the streets. Desecration of monuments, such as the damage caused last year to the statue of Winston Churchill, will not be tolerated and there will be immediate arrests, Sir John Stevens said. Sir John said that there were more than 240 commercial targets for today's protest. \"I personally hope there will be no violence but I firmly believe there will be damage to property and we need to police this,\" he said. He said that a repeat of last year's violence would not be accepted but denied the suggestion that the force was adopting a zero tolerance policy. Sir John said he was aware of the possibility of a strike by the Real IRA under the cover of the chaos today.

The Howard League for Penal Reform yesterday urged candidates to back its manifesto, which also calls for more community sentences and imprisonment only as a last resort. The league said it would be open about those who refuse to offer support, though it said it would be \"naming and praising\" rather than \"naming and shaming\". The new challenge to candidates comes after an anti-racism pledge drawn up by the commission for racial equality ignited the current race row within the Conservative party. The Howard League manifesto also comes after William Hague clashed with Lord Woolf, the Lord Chief Justice, who last year urged politicians to steer clear of playing the \"prison card\" as he warned of growing prison overcrowding. The Conservative leader then argued it might be necessary to increase the country's prison population - already the second highest in Western Europe - in order to tackle crime. The league is also unhappy with government prison policy. Its president, creator of Rumpole of the Bailey, Sir John Mortimer QC, yesterday made clear his personal view that Labour had \"failed totally\". He said: \"The business of leaders is to reawaken thinking about the efficacy of prisons. Politicians should lead public opinion rather than slavishly following it.\" The league's manifesto sets out five principles, including basing the penal system on \"effective community penalties\" and concentrating public resources on preventing crime. Prisons should \"provide a positive experience and a realistic chance of rehabilitation\", and the criminal justice process should be based on the principle of repairing the damage done by crime, the statement adds. Publishing statistics showing that the use of imprisonment in Britain is second only to Portugal among western European states, the league sets out five priorities for action, including reducing the prison population to the European average. Campaigners also want children taken out of prisons, \"proper status\" for the rights and needs of victims of crime and promotion of safer communities through social and economic policies. A spokesman yesterday acknowledged that the league did not anticipate party leaders signing the declaration.

      "bodyText": "George Bush will launch the biggest weapons policy gamble of his presidency today when he announces that Washington is willing to spend whatever it takes to build its controversial missile defence shield. The announcement, which involves crucial decisions for America's allies including Britain, will put relations between the US, EU and Russia to their most critical test since Ronald Reagan's 1980s cruise missile deployments. On the day which the former Soviet Union always chose to parade its military might, Mr Bush will tell a May Day military audience that the US is preparing to scrap the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty which both Russia and China claim is the cornerstone of arms control agreements. The scrapping of the treaty paves the way for a vastly more ambitious missile defence programme than anything the Pentagon has yet contemplated. Instead of the relatively limited but still controversial national missile defence system developed under Bill Clinton, Mr Bush intends to build a \"multi-layered\" shield for the US and its allies, using sea- and space-based radars, lasers and interceptors, in a project reminiscent of the Reagan-era \"Star Wars\" system. The Clinton administration's plans were confined to 100 land-based interceptors in Alaska that were intended to provide a shield for the US. The 1972 treaty explicitly bans the US and Russia from developing national missile interceptor systems for defence, and is regarded by most countries as the foundation of three decades of negotiations to prevent arms proliferation. Military chiefs and Republican politicians in the US have long disliked the treaty, however, and have won the argument in the new administration. \"We will deploy defences as soon as possible. Therefore we believe that the ABM treaty will have to be replaced, eliminated or changed in a fundamental way,\" a Bush administration official, Lucas Fischer, said in Denmark last week. \"Mr Bush appears to be on the threshold of unleashing nuclear anarchy,\" Dan Plesch of the British American Security Information Council in Washington, said. In an attempt to cushion the inevitable blow which the decision will deliver to the existing structure of international arms control, Mr Bush is expected to signal US willingness to make deep new cuts in its nuclear arsenal, reducing the current 7,500 warheads by up to two-thirds. The US is already committed to cutting its strategic nuclear warheads to 3,500 under the 1993 Start-2 strategic arms limitation treaty with Russia, but Mr Bush is expected to go further. Administration hawks believe such decisions should be made unilaterally, befitting the US's post-cold war status as the sole global superpower. Mr Bush will also announce that the US is launching an intensive diplomatic offensive with Nato and Russia to win international acceptance for the missile shield plan. Britain will be a particularly important part of that persuasion effort because the US shield involves the upgrading of the Fylingdales radar station in north Yorkshire. Yesterday he telephoned Tony Blair and Jacques Chirac, the French president, to discuss today's announcement. Teams of senior US officials are expected in European capitals within days in an exercise which governments on both sides of the Atlantic hope will give a face-saving cover of consultation to what most independent observers now see as a fait accompli . President Bush is due to come to Europe next month for the first time to meet Nato chiefs in Brussels and to attend a US-EU summit in Gothenberg. Britain and other US allies have pressed Washington to consult widely and in detail about its plans before announcing its conclusions, but there has never been any question of the administration's commitment to a policy which was at the heart of Mr Bush's election platform. \"We want this to be a consultative process,\" the US secretary of state, Colin Powell, told a congressional committee last week. \"But we're going forward with a missile defence.\" Mr Bush is not expected to go into detail about his plans in today's speech to the National Defence University in Washington, but the announcement will make little attempt to hide the fact that his administration has already decided to commit billions of extra dollars over the coming decades to missile defences.

      "bodyText": "Gerhard Schr\u00f6der's proposals for European Union reform created less outrage among his fellow leaders yesterday than among British Eurosceptics. But they are still unlikely to find many buyers elsewhere in the club. Romano Prodi, president of the European commission, welcomed the German chancellor's ideas as a \"contribution\" to the debate about the EU's future, though he gave no hint of his own thoughts, due to be published shortly. Tony Blair has good reason to be irritated by Mr Schr\u00f6der's views - not so much because he disagrees with most of them, but because they are grist to the mill of a Tory party desperate to make Europe an election issue. But the French president, Jacques Chirac, and the Spanish prime minister, Jose-Maria Aznar, a fierce defender of his national interests, will be no less annoyed at this revival of divisive debate so soon after last December's Nice summit. Wolfgang Sch\u00fcssel, the Austrian chancellor, who often speaks for smaller countries, warned against a \"European superstate\". The federally minded Belgium, which is taking over the EU's rotating presidency in July, was predictably delighted. But under EU rules the kind of changes under discussion in Berlin could only take place if all 15 member states agreed: that is simply unimaginable. Viewed from Brussels, Mr Schr\u00f6der's ideas are a mixed bag: his call for transforming the European commission into a \"real executive\" sounds radical if unclear, but will please integrationists. \"Some of the things we do clearly do involve governing,\" said one bemused commission official, \"though calling us a government is obviously a red rag in the UK.\" Others suggested that the ideas were half-baked, and were not the chancellor's own. But Mr Schr\u00f6der's suggestion of making the council of ministers into a second chamber of the European parliament is revolutionary. It is likely to be brusquely rejected in most national capitals. French officials insisted that they would not accept such a dilution of sovereignty. Paris feels Mr Schr\u00f6der is making a renewed bid for a leadership role for Germany. \"He's constructed himself a nice platform,\" said one veteran EU-watcher. But however much they disagree, EU leaders do not publicly rubbish each others ideas. Mr Schr\u00f6der's are part of a series of attempts to put national stamps on a debate that will be raging in 2004, when a conference on changing the European treaty is to be held. It was at Nice that leaders agreed, largely under German pressure, on a fresh round of reform negotiations to clarify the crucial division of labour between EU institutions, national governments and regional authorities. Germany's Green foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, set the ball rolling before that, followed by Mr Chirac, who effectively called for a \"two-speed\" Europe in which like-minded states would forge ahead, leaving the laggards behind. Tony Blair, whose main worry is the euro, followed suit in October -declaring that he wanted a Europe that was a \"superpower, but not a superstate\". But the prime minister's most significant point then was the idea that the 626-member European parliament should have a second chamber to redress the democratic deficit and increase links with voters at home. Here he has something important in common with Mr Schr\u00f6der - a desire to bring Europe closer to its citizens. British reactions to the German proposals were greeted with familiar dismay in Brussels. \"It is a massive problem for Britain,\" sighed a commission insider, \"because as soon as anyone says anything about Europe people rush out to dig air-raidshelters in their back gardens. It means we just can't have a serious discussion.\"",

      "body": "<p>Red Herring Communications, publisher of Red Herring magazine, one of the first newsletters of the dot.com community, could be looking for a buyer. </p> <p>The San Francisco-based owner of the magazine, a website, a conference business and a research unit, according to the Wall Street Journal, recently approached AOL Time Warner's magazine division and Ziff Davis Media, a US-based internet magazine publisher, about selling part or all of the company. </p> <p>Ross Settles, senior vice-president for marketing, refused to be more specific but said the firm recently secured funding and did not need to sell. It is thought AOL Time Warner and Ziff Davis Media may not be interested in completing a deal with Red Herring. </p> <p>A company spokeswoman said: \"We do not need to sell the business, we just finished a strategic round of financing to grow the business and we are looking to expand internationally.\" </p> <p>The reports come weeks after the demise of the European arm of internet business magazine Industry Standard. Red Herring, which was at the centre of the dot.com boom, is the latest in a series of internet publications to suffer as the demand for technology and new economy magazines has waned. </p> <p>Magazine publisher Future Network announced last week the closure of all the European editions of its new economy title, Business 2.0. There has been speculation over the possible sale of the US edition during the past couple of months, with some estimating it to be valued at $50m (\u00a335m). </p> <p>Red Herring is one of the more established internet magazines - it was founded in 1993 - and describes itself on its website as providing \"timely market information, strategic insight and access to growing entrepreneurial communities\". </p> <p>The company expanded last year and doubled the magazine's publishing frequency at the height of the technology sector boom. Red Herring has, however, seen advertising revenues fall and has had two rounds of staff cuts. In December the companycut 32 workers - 9% of its employees - two months after announcing the loss of 22 jobs. </p> <p>The Wall Street Journal report said the number of pages of advertising in Red Herring fell 28% in the first quarter of 2001 as dot.com firms ran out of cash. It is thought to be more financially secure than some of its competitors because it has a relatively large circulation - 325,000, according to the company. </p> <p>Red Herring's chairman, Tony Perkins, last month was said to have considered selling the company to help fund a campaign to run for governor of California. </p> <p>Ziff Davis Media yesterday refused to comment and AOL Time Warner and Red Herring were unavailable.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.redherring.com\">Red Herring magazine</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Red Herring Communications, publisher of Red Herring magazine, one of the first newsletters of the dot.com community, could be looking for a buyer. The San Francisco-based owner of the magazine, a website, a conference business and a research unit, according to the Wall Street Journal, recently approached AOL Time Warner's magazine division and Ziff Davis Media, a US-based internet magazine publisher, about selling part or all of the company. Ross Settles, senior vice-president for marketing, refused to be more specific but said the firm recently secured funding and did not need to sell. It is thought AOL Time Warner and Ziff Davis Media may not be interested in completing a deal with Red Herring. A company spokeswoman said: \"We do not need to sell the business, we just finished a strategic round of financing to grow the business and we are looking to expand internationally.\" The reports come weeks after the demise of the European arm of internet business magazine Industry Standard. Red Herring, which was at the centre of the dot.com boom, is the latest in a series of internet publications to suffer as the demand for technology and new economy magazines has waned. Magazine publisher Future Network announced last week the closure of all the European editions of its new economy title, Business 2.0. There has been speculation over the possible sale of the US edition during the past couple of months, with some estimating it to be valued at $50m (\u00a335m). Red Herring is one of the more established internet magazines - it was founded in 1993 - and describes itself on its website as providing \"timely market information, strategic insight and access to growing entrepreneurial communities\". The company expanded last year and doubled the magazine's publishing frequency at the height of the technology sector boom. Red Herring has, however, seen advertising revenues fall and has had two rounds of staff cuts. In December the companycut 32 workers - 9% of its employees - two months after announcing the loss of 22 jobs. The Wall Street Journal report said the number of pages of advertising in Red Herring fell 28% in the first quarter of 2001 as dot.com firms ran out of cash. It is thought to be more financially secure than some of its competitors because it has a relatively large circulation - 325,000, according to the company. Red Herring's chairman, Tony Perkins, last month was said to have considered selling the company to help fund a campaign to run for governor of California. Ziff Davis Media yesterday refused to comment and AOL Time Warner and Red Herring were unavailable. Red Herring magazine",

      "body": "<p>A grey cloud hangs almost permanently above Franny Traynor's head. A thick fug of smoke curls from the cigarettes he nurses in thin, nervous hands. \"Look at me,\" he says. \"I'm still smoking. I have had nine heart attacks, I have had open-heart surgery and I'm still smoking. All I hear from the doctors is stop the smoking but I am addicted. I will be smoking until I die.\"</p> <p>That day may well come sooner rather than later; or so, at least, contends Imperial Tobacco. This week, at the tobacco giant's request, Traynor faces a grilling by its lawyers at the court of session in Edinburgh. The 66-year-old from Milngavie near Glasgow is one of 20 people suing the tobacco industry in the Scottish courts, and the company has asked for him to give his evidence \"on commission\" in case he dies before his legal action comes to court.</p> <p>Over three days from tomorrow, despite his frailty, Traynor will be questioned by a QC for Imperial. He has been refused legal aid, so he will have no lawyer of his own to lead him gently through his evidence-in-chief as a build-up to a tough cross-examination by the company's QC. His solicitor, Cameron Fyfe, who is running the cases on a no-win, no-fee basis, has prepared an affidavit for him to hand in, but otherwise he will be on his own.</p> <p>The tobacco industry has been forced to pay out millions of dollars in the US, but in Britain it has managed to see off all attempts so far to bring it before the courts. Litigation on behalf of more than 50 lung cancer victims in England collapsed in 1999, losing the lawyers who backed it on a no-win, no-fee basis \u00a32m in fees. But north of the border, the industry is still in the line of fire. The first test case, pursued by Margaret McTear from Ayrshire, whose husband, Alfred, died of lung cancer in 1993, goes to court in September. The evidence Alfred McTear gave on commission before his death will form part of her case.</p> <p>The tactic of taking evidence on commission has been condemned by anti-smoking campaigners, who say it can be used as a means of intimidating victims, scaring them away from pursuing a case. (Imperial insists it is \"a straightforward and normal procedure to preserve evidence\", approved by the court; and points out that McTear's solicitors had suggested it in his case.) Does the prospect frighten Traynor? \"I'm not worrying about it,\" he says, lighting and lifting another cigarette with the practised ease of the lifelong smoker. \"There's no point any more in worrying. Although, if I'm honest, I'm nervous about a couple of QCs trying to talk smart to me.</p> <p>\"The thing I object to, that unsettles me, is that they have gone through my whole life: all my files, every record from the day I was born to the present day, my health, my work, my DHSS, my criminal cases have been pulled. I'm no angel, I've been in court maybe half a dozen times, and they will be pulling all of this out of the hat. But it has nothing to do with cigarettes; 90% of my life has nothing to do with cigarettes.\"</p> <p>Fyfe, a Glasgow solicitor who is acting for Traynor and the others who have lodged cases against the tobacco trade, says the commission hearing will be gruelling. \"It will be an ordeal for him and I applaud his courage in proceeding with this. It is bad enough for a healthy man with experience of court matters to go through what he will go through, but for someone with no experience and in poor health it will be even more of an ordeal. But I know he is a very brave and determined man and he will fight his corner in that commission.\"</p> <p>Like so many, Traynor started smoking at school. \"I was the same as any other boy. I started smoking at 10 or 11 in the toilets. You will hear the same from any boy. Most of them stuck with it, like me. I've been a regular 20-a-day man. I wouldn't say I was a heavy smoker but I have been smoking all my life.\"</p> <p>He has always smoked Embassy and he can still recite the gifts he collected from the old Embassy coupons; an electric cordless screwdriver, a jigsaw. After spells in the army and navy he set himself up in the furniture removal trade, operating in and around Milngavie, where he was born. It was a thriving business that he had to give up after his heart packed in. He had his first heart attack when he was 53. \"The pain is that bloody severe that you lie about the floor like an idiot writhing. That's the terrible thing about heart attacks. It's like someone switched you into a socket. The pain is tremendous; people were all around me trying to hold me down.\"</p> <p>The attack almost killed him and doctors told him to stop smoking and drinking. He managed to give up the drink, but not the cigarettes. \"I tried to come off but I found it terrible because I have been smoking all my life. I told the doctors I couldn't do it. I was ready to thump somebody.\" In the past 14 years he has had eight more heart attacks. He says he could die at any time. \"It might even be next week.\"</p> <p>His wife, Mary, herself a lifelong smoker, has been listening to him talk. A quiet, questioning woman, she wonders why America seems so far ahead in the tobacco litigation battle and why her husband must face a gruelling court ordeal to try to convince the authorities that he is addicted.</p> <p>\"When I think back to when he tried to give up, he was just so depressed. It got to the stage where he would just sit and stare and say nothing. He just couldn't do it. I have tried to stop so many times but I can't, even although they have made my husband so ill.\"</p> <p>The English cases, run by two leading law firms, Leigh Day &amp; Co and Irwin Mitchell, involved exhaustive research and cost Leigh Day \u00a3750,000 in out-of-pocket expenses, according to senior partner Martyn Day. They collapsed when the judge, Mr Justice Wright, ruled that most of the claims had been launched too long after the original diagnosis of lung cancer. He refused to exercise his discretion to allow them to go ahead anyway, describing them as \"speculative\".</p> <p>Cameron Fyfe explains: \"The problem in England was that they were required to take the cases on as a group action, whereas in Scotland we could just go ahead with one case, that being McTear. So it's much more manageable. We're trying as well as we can to do it very simplistically, just putting forward very basic arguments without getting tied up in millions of documents, which is what the tobacco companies try to do. Our basic argument is that prior to 1971, when the warnings came on cigarette packets, the tobacco companies knew or ought to have known that cigarettes were injurious to health, but they failed to warn the consumers. When the warnings came on in 1971, our clients, in particular Mr McTear, tried to stop smoking but couldn't, because by that time they were addicted.\"</p> <p>If Mrs McTear loses, all the other cases, including Franny Traynor's, will be dismissed. \"If she wins, I would hope Imperial Tobacco might then settle some or most of them,\" says Fyfe. \"If they do, fine. If they don't, I'm almost certain we will get legal aid for the ones that are in dispute. Sometimes I think, if you'll excuse the pun, that there's a smokescreen around the tobacco cases. If it were anything else - if Coca-Cola was producing products that kill people and didn't warn anybody about it - there would be a national outcry.\"</p> <p>In the Traynors' home in Milngavie, seven of the nine children smoke and the conversation is interrupted by one son who comes in to beg a cigarette off Mary. Traynor says he is not going to court for their sake, or anyone else's for that matter. \"I'm not bothered about anyone else. I'm not out crusading for other people. I'm just doing this because I'm angry. I'm doing it because I'm angry with them. It is the chief interest for me getting them to say that it is bloody addictive and getting that put on the packet with all their other fancy warnings. I'm addicted and if any judge asks me to prove that I'll just ask him to give me an ashtray.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p>The serial killer Harold Shipman was being interviewed yesterday over nine suspicious deaths while he was working as a GP in West Yorkshire at the beginning of his medical career.</p> <p>The inquiry reinforces the fears of the relatives of some of his victims that the former family doctor could have been systematically murdering patients for more than a quarter of a century.</p> <p>Detectives from West Yorkshire police travelled to Frankland prison in Durham, where the bearded and bespectacled killer is serving 15 life sentences, to talk to him about the deaths in the Todmorden area in the 1970s.</p> <p>Shipman worked at the Abraham Ormerod medical centre between 1974 and 1976. Colleagues remembered his dedication, hard work and energy, but he also had an unusually high death rate. Police were investigating all 22 death certificates signed by Shipman.</p> <p>It is the first time Shipman has spoken to detectives since the run-up to his court case last year, when he was convicted of killing 15 women patients from Hyde, Greater Manchester. He has always refused to cooperate with Greater Manchester police, who have been investigating the deaths of hundreds of other patients.</p> <p>Shipman has also turned down requests from the South Manchester coroner, John Pollard, who has held 24 inquests into deaths of former patients. In all but two cases the coroner recorded verdicts of unlawful killing.</p> <p>Three patients from the Todmorden practice died on the same day - January 21 1975. Relatives of Lily Crossley, Robert Lingard and Elizabeth Pearce insist that they died suddenly after bedside visits from Shipman.</p> <p>His modus operandi in all his known murders was to inject his patients with a lethal dose of diamorphine. Most of his victims were elderly women - although some were middle aged and a handful were men.</p> <p>Shipman worked in Todmorden, a former mill town, until forced to leave when he was convicted of illegally possessing the prescription drug pethidine - an analgesic and anaesthetic often used to relieve the pain of childbirth. He was fined by Halifax magistrates and escaped a General Medical Council disciplinary hearing after he was treated for drug addiction.</p> <p>A former GP, now retired, who worked with Shipman in Todmorden described him as a breath of fresh air to the Todmorden practice.

      "bodyText": "The serial killer Harold Shipman was being interviewed yesterday over nine suspicious deaths while he was working as a GP in West Yorkshire at the beginning of his medical career. The inquiry reinforces the fears of the relatives of some of his victims that the former family doctor could have been systematically murdering patients for more than a quarter of a century. Detectives from West Yorkshire police travelled to Frankland prison in Durham, where the bearded and bespectacled killer is serving 15 life sentences, to talk to him about the deaths in the Todmorden area in the 1970s. Shipman worked at the Abraham Ormerod medical centre between 1974 and 1976. Colleagues remembered his dedication, hard work and energy, but he also had an unusually high death rate. Police were investigating all 22 death certificates signed by Shipman. It is the first time Shipman has spoken to detectives since the run-up to his court case last year, when he was convicted of killing 15 women patients from Hyde, Greater Manchester. He has always refused to cooperate with Greater Manchester police, who have been investigating the deaths of hundreds of other patients. Shipman has also turned down requests from the South Manchester coroner, John Pollard, who has held 24 inquests into deaths of former patients. In all but two cases the coroner recorded verdicts of unlawful killing. Three patients from the Todmorden practice died on the same day - January 21 1975. Relatives of Lily Crossley, Robert Lingard and Elizabeth Pearce insist that they died suddenly after bedside visits from Shipman. His modus operandi in all his known murders was to inject his patients with a lethal dose of diamorphine. Most of his victims were elderly women - although some were middle aged and a handful were men. Shipman worked in Todmorden, a former mill town, until forced to leave when he was convicted of illegally possessing the prescription drug pethidine - an analgesic and anaesthetic often used to relieve the pain of childbirth. He was fined by Halifax magistrates and escaped a General Medical Council disciplinary hearing after he was treated for drug addiction. A former GP, now retired, who worked with Shipman in Todmorden described him as a breath of fresh air to the Todmorden practice. Michael Grieve, now 72, said he was very keen and a good technician. \"If any extra work came up, you didn't have to ask for a volunteer because Fred - as he was known to colleagues and patients alike - was there two paces ahead of you,\" he said. Other former colleagues spoke of a sense of disbelief about the alleged murders. Another said: \"He didn't bump off everybody he treated, so presumably he did some of them some good.\" Jane Ashton-Hibbert, who runs a support group for the families, said she would be very surprised if Shipman answered the detectives' questions. Her grandmother, Hilda Hibbert, was unlawfully killed by Shipman in 1996. \"I have seen the pain these families have gone through and the hurt because he has not admitted what he has done. It must be particularly bad for people in Todmorden because it happened such a long time ago. \"I would love to be wrong, but I would doubt he will ever admit his guilt. He has got all the power, so why would he help any of us?\" A public inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the activities of Shipman will begin in Manchester in June, chaired by Dame Janet Smith, a high court judge.",

      "body": "<p>I think the favourite of all the books on my shelves (yeah, I've got Ulysses and War and Peace and all that stuff too) is a Penguin Special from 1958 by one RC Churchill entitled 60 Seasons of League Football. According to the pencil-mark at the front, it cost me 10p. </p> <p>This forgotten masterwork devotes a page of mostly tedious stats to every club that has ever played in the Football League. Churchill, however, was a polymath in an era when football intellectualism was far less fashionable than it is now, and he adorns each team with an apt literary quotation. And it is the clubs that were long since buried, even in 1958, that make the book so resonant. </p> <p>Ashington, the Charlton boys' home town, were in Division III (North) in the 1920s (\"Ye Northumbrian shades... How gladly I recall\" - Akenside). So were Durham City, Nelson and Stalybridge Celtic. In Division III (South) were Merthyr Tydfil (\"Afar behind a western hill\" - Flecker) and Thames, based in the East End. </p> <p>Long before that came Darwen, Glossop North End and - savour this - Middlesbrough Ironopolis. Bootle were voted into the Second Division in 1892 and voted out in 1893 (\"Hope of a season's fame\" - Newbolt). There was even a town which now has no League clubs that once had two. Naming the town (answer below) used to be a cruel press-box initiation rite for tyro sports journalists. </p> <p>Nowhere is there a mention of any town as one-horse as Rushden (pop: 25,000). Yet this week, barring an improbable set of results, a football club called Rushden and Diamonds will be promoted to what some of us still call the Fourth Division of the Football League. And this is a game so metropolitan that Norwich, once England's second city, are usually referred to as \"country cousins\". Rushden's elevation is not just a bit of football trivia; it is a slice of geopolitical history. </p> <p>Rushden, you may need to be told, is an old Northamptonshire shoe town. The only apt quote comes from HE Bates, who was born there and called it \"a palpably dreadful mess ... blue slate, factory, chapel and that harsh Midland red brick which equally oppresses heart, soul, eye and senses.\" </p> <p>Writers can only be that cruel about their home town. I worked briefly in a Rushden newspaper office and found it charmingly dull: like Aberystwyth on Valium.

      "bodyText": "I think the favourite of all the books on my shelves (yeah, I've got Ulysses and War and Peace and all that stuff too) is a Penguin Special from 1958 by one RC Churchill entitled 60 Seasons of League Football. According to the pencil-mark at the front, it cost me 10p. This forgotten masterwork devotes a page of mostly tedious stats to every club that has ever played in the Football League. Churchill, however, was a polymath in an era when football intellectualism was far less fashionable than it is now, and he adorns each team with an apt literary quotation. And it is the clubs that were long since buried, even in 1958, that make the book so resonant. Ashington, the Charlton boys' home town, were in Division III (North) in the 1920s (\"Ye Northumbrian shades... How gladly I recall\" - Akenside). So were Durham City, Nelson and Stalybridge Celtic. In Division III (South) were Merthyr Tydfil (\"Afar behind a western hill\" - Flecker) and Thames, based in the East End. Long before that came Darwen, Glossop North End and - savour this - Middlesbrough Ironopolis. Bootle were voted into the Second Division in 1892 and voted out in 1893 (\"Hope of a season's fame\" - Newbolt). There was even a town which now has no League clubs that once had two. Naming the town (answer below) used to be a cruel press-box initiation rite for tyro sports journalists. Nowhere is there a mention of any town as one-horse as Rushden (pop: 25,000). Yet this week, barring an improbable set of results, a football club called Rushden and Diamonds will be promoted to what some of us still call the Fourth Division of the Football League. And this is a game so metropolitan that Norwich, once England's second city, are usually referred to as \"country cousins\". Rushden's elevation is not just a bit of football trivia; it is a slice of geopolitical history. Rushden, you may need to be told, is an old Northamptonshire shoe town. The only apt quote comes from HE Bates, who was born there and called it \"a palpably dreadful mess ... blue slate, factory, chapel and that harsh Midland red brick which equally oppresses heart, soul, eye and senses.\" Writers can only be that cruel about their home town. I worked briefly in a Rushden newspaper office and found it charmingly dull: like Aberystwyth on Valium. Mind you, I didn't last long: after being sent to interview four golden wedding couples in four days and reporting back each time that the happy pair had gone away on holiday without giving the neighbours a phone number, I thought it safest to resign before someone cottoned on. And nothing is happening in Rushden, even now. The successful football club was formed from a merger between two old rivals, Rushden Town and Irthlingborough Diamonds, and they actually play in Irthlingborough, several miles away (pop: 6.500). This is a town with no horses at all, possibly because they were all rendered at the animal products factory that traditionally stank the place out. Locals call the town Artlenock and don't ask me why. All it has, apart from a \"remarkable\" (Pevsner) church tower is a swanky new football stadium, Nene Park (Note to BBC: it's pronounced Nen not Neen). It's more like a multiplex - you get shown to your seat by \"Rusherettes\" and have your own popcorn holder - instead of a proper ground, with someone peeing on the back of your leg.

      "bodyText": "A takeover is brewing at Whittard of Chelsea, the purveyor of fine teas, which saw its shares surge 38% yesterday on news of a bid approach. The news came at a tricky time for the 115-year-old company, which has dipped into the red after heavy investment in new stores and online activities. Shares in Whittard rose 10.5p to 38p, valuing the business at \u00a38.2m. The biggest shareholders are chairman Will Hobhouse, who has a 24% stake, and non-executive director David Glyne-Thompson, with 20%. The identity of the bidder remained a mystery. It is understood that the management is not involved, and neither is PizzaExpress entrepreneur Luke Johnson, who recently resigned from the board. Insiders ruled out internet incubator Antfactory, which has a 15% stake. Rival tea specialist Taylors of Harrogate is not a runner and neither is Associated British Foods, which owns Twinings Tea. Analyst David Stoddart of Teather &amp; Greenwood said: \"Broadly speaking, it's a good business. Their problem has been that they overexpanded the UK retail side and, at the same time, they incurred launch costs on the internet.\" Traditionally, Whittard's sales were split into three roughly equal portions: tea, coffee and ceramics. However, Whittard's crockery has lost ground to bigger stores such as Woolworth and Bhs. Whittard last year bought bestofbritish.com, a luxury goods website, from Conrad Black's Hollinger Group. As part of the deal, Hollinger took an 8% stake in Whittard.",

This is more than a 'bare possibility' but less than 'more likely than not.'\" </p> <p>This monstrosity is with us because the current regulatory regime governing financial markets, which largely dates from 1986, has not worked. The wording of legislation has alternately proved to be too tight or too slack, with the result that only the most gormless have had their collars felt for insider dealing and precious few of these have been convicted. Meanwhile, blatant cases of market rigging and price manipulation have become a daily occurrence in London - and just about every outrageous example has remained beyond the regulators' reach. </p> <p>Yet whether the latest policy statement from the FSA, carrying the sexy sub-title Feedback on CP59 and CP76, does much to level the field for the cops and robbers of finance remains as debatable as ever. The immediate response among most City practitioners yesterday was to go into spasm. They foresee wrangle after wrangle, dealing rooms carpeted with legal advisers and a whopping great thing called \"cost\" which, in the end, will be passed on to the end customer of the financial markets - the public. </p> <p>What we can be sure of is that there is more than a bare possibility that, as soon as the FSA tries to implement any of the heavier powers soon to be at its disposal, the whole matter will end up in the courts. In fact, it is more likely than not. </p> <p><strong> Six of the best </strong><br> </p> <p>Bank of Scotland and Halifax have not declared it publicly but in the next few days, provided executive egos can be suitably massaged, they will bill their \u00a327bn merger as a creation of a \"fifth force\" on the high street. </p> <p>This is precisely how BoS and Abbey National had described their potential alliance - before Lloyds TSB spoilt the party with its attack on Abbey. </p> <p>Little wonder, then, that Lloyds is taking heart. A combined Halifax/Edinburgh bank would be a new powerhouse on the high street to rival the big four - Lloyds TSB, HSBC, Barclays and NatWest/Royal Bank of Scotland. The competition would come not just in the sensitive area of current accounts but also in business banking, where a separate competition investigation is under way. </p> <p>If Lloyds has its way, this changing dynamic will be enough to persuade the competition commission that its \u00a318bn bid for Abbey should be given the green light. The City has started to begin thinking this way, too, and it is not difficult to see why. </p> <p>But this is just too simplistic. Two players uniting to take on the undoubted dominance of the big four does not automatically mean that the competitive mismatch in high street banking has magically disappeared. </p> <p>Abbey still has a crucial role to play in competing against the big four, most importantly in the area of current accounts, which affects almost every consumer's life. One day, Abbey might even manage to break in to business banking where the big four - and BoS - have provided all the muscle. And, with a bit of luck, Abbey's chief executive Ian Harley will eventually realise the error of his decision to ditch his own talks with BoS, and find another suitable partner. </p> <p>Yes, we should have a decent sixth force in banking. </p> <p>Creating a fifth and then instantly tipping the cart over with a newly empowered sector leader rather misses the point. </p> <p>As for Lloyds, it should get on and do what it has been threatening to do for years: expand into Europe.</p>",

Yet whether the latest policy statement from the FSA, carrying the sexy sub-title Feedback on CP59 and CP76, does much to level the field for the cops and robbers of finance remains as debatable as ever. The immediate response among most City practitioners yesterday was to go into spasm. They foresee wrangle after wrangle, dealing rooms carpeted with legal advisers and a whopping great thing called \"cost\" which, in the end, will be passed on to the end customer of the financial markets - the public. What we can be sure of is that there is more than a bare possibility that, as soon as the FSA tries to implement any of the heavier powers soon to be at its disposal, the whole matter will end up in the courts. In fact, it is more likely than not. Six of the best Bank of Scotland and Halifax have not declared it publicly but in the next few days, provided executive egos can be suitably massaged, they will bill their \u00a327bn merger as a creation of a \"fifth force\" on the high street. This is precisely how BoS and Abbey National had described their potential alliance - before Lloyds TSB spoilt the party with its attack on Abbey. Little wonder, then, that Lloyds is taking heart. A combined Halifax/Edinburgh bank would be a new powerhouse on the high street to rival the big four - Lloyds TSB, HSBC, Barclays and NatWest/Royal Bank of Scotland. The competition would come not just in the sensitive area of current accounts but also in business banking, where a separate competition investigation is under way. If Lloyds has its way, this changing dynamic will be enough to persuade the competition commission that its \u00a318bn bid for Abbey should be given the green light. The City has started to begin thinking this way, too, and it is not difficult to see why. But this is just too simplistic. Two players uniting to take on the undoubted dominance of the big four does not automatically mean that the competitive mismatch in high street banking has magically disappeared. Abbey still has a crucial role to play in competing against the big four, most importantly in the area of current accounts, which affects almost every consumer's life. One day, Abbey might even manage to break in to business banking where the big four - and BoS - have provided all the muscle. And, with a bit of luck, Abbey's chief executive Ian Harley will eventually realise the error of his decision to ditch his own talks with BoS, and find another suitable partner. Yes, we should have a decent sixth force in banking. Creating a fifth and then instantly tipping the cart over with a newly empowered sector leader rather misses the point. As for Lloyds, it should get on and do what it has been threatening to do for years: expand into Europe.",

If MPs are dissatisfied with his reply they can start impeachment proceedings. With seven of the 10 parliamentary factions, together occupying more than 80% of the seats, apparently determined to depose him, most MPs said the only uncertainty was how long it would take to organise the session of the People's Consultative Assembly to begin the impeachment proceedings. Their estimates varied from one or two months. Expecting huge protests by fanatical Wahid loyalists, the authorities turned the parliament building into a fortress, surrounding it with barbed wire and barricades, and stationed thousands of police officers and troops throughout the capital, Jakarta. Several thousand of Mr Wahid's supporters marched from the central square to parliament but a tropical storm and the heavy police presence dampened their enthusiasm and they dispersed without incident. Mr Wahid's fate was effectively sealed early in the debate when the three biggest parties all declared that they would support the second censure. The Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle, led by Vice-President Megawati Sukarnoputri, attacked Mr Wahid's mismanagement and failure to tackle the rampant corruption. Other parties adopted a similar tone, each focusing on a different issue. The former government party Golkar concentrated on the economy and the biggest Islamic party, United Development, criticised Mr Wahid's propensity to travel abroad - he has visited more than 50 countries since taking office 18 months ago - during regional unrest at home. The influential military and police faction abstained. Mr Wahid spent the day listening to classical music and receiving ministerial briefings. His spokesman said the opposition was \"blaming Wahid for everything from A-Z\", but had no right to, since the first censure focused on his alleged involvement in two financial scandals.",

      "body": "<p>The beds of the four teenagers take up an entire wall at Wafa hospital in Gaza. Tharif Ghora, 16, was shot in the shoulder when he peeked over a barricade at the Karni border crossing on November 19. Hussein Na'ezi, also 16 and with Tharif a regular at the confrontations with Israeli soldiers at Karni, took a bullet in the neck the day before.</p> <p>Ahmed Abu Taha, a stick-thin boy with almond eyes, the baby of the ward at 14, was running from a tank in Rafah refugee camp on February 18 when a bullet penetrated his back. Mahmoud Sarhan, 16, was shot in the neck.</p> <p>None of them will walk again. Hussein and Mahmoud will not even be able to lower themselves into wheelchairs because their injuries are higher up the spinal cord.</p> <p>They - and 1,000 others - are the maimed of the intifada, with permanent injuries which range from a limp or the loss of an eye to paralysis and mental disability: a harvest of mutilation which far outstrips the death toll in the Palestinian uprising.</p> <p>All four of the boys threw stones at Israeli soldiers and tanks - Tharif used to detour past Karni on his way home from school - and all four were unarmed.</p> <p>They, like many of the other injured and dead, are the victims of what the UN security council and international and Israeli human rights groups condemn as excessive use of force by Israel against the uprising, now in its seventh month.</p> <p>A great deal of the criticism has focused on Israel's use of high-velocity bullets fired from M-16 assault rifles. When these penetrate flesh they cartwheel through the body with explosive force.</p> <p>None of the four boys is aware that he will spend the rest of his life as prisoner of his body. In his hospital bed, a beaming Tharif is being fattened up with shwarma, the meat sandwiches his father sells at a roadside stall in Gaza City.</p> <p>There is an involuntary twitch in his swollen left foot. \"You see?\" says his father, Abid Ghora. \"One day, God willing, he will make a full recovery. Maybe if we can send him to Germany, they can do something for him.\"</p> <p>The number of Palestinians left with some form of permanent disability by this uprising is not entirely clear. According to the Palestinian Red Crescent Society, the injured up to two days ago numbered 13,296, 20% of the hit by bullets.</p> <p>The Institute of Community and Public Health at Bir Zeit University, the premier Palestinian academic establishment, sifted through mounds of hospital records to arrive at an estimate of at least 1,000 people who will be permanently afflicted after being hit by Israeli live fire, shrapnel, or rubber-tipped steel bullets.</p> <p>More than 400 of the injured have been treated for lasting disability at three rehabilitation 12centres in the West Bank and Gaza Strip - the only places of their kind for a combined population of 3m people - and at an eye hospital in occupied Arab East Jerusalem. Five hundred of the seriously injured have been treated abroad, including Tharif and Hussein, who were sent to Jordan.</p> <p>In the West Bank town of Beit Jala, Elias Saba, a therapist at the Bethlehem Arab Society for Rehabilitation, is trying to coax a response from Amjed Saadi, 18.</p> <p>\"Marhaba,\" Dr Saba, says to him: hello in Arabic. Sitting in his wheelchair with his right hand clenched in a fist, Mr Saadi grunts twice in reply.</p> <p>The doctor asks him to put a hand on his nose; Mr Saadi shades his eyes.</p> <p>Mr Saadi was shot in the head with a high velocity bullet fired by an Israeli soldier on October 2, in the first few days of the intifada. He woke from his coma five weeks ago with permanent brain damage.His eyes are alert but spinal fluid is collecting in a bulge on the side of his head, and he will need more surgery.</p> <p>Human rights groups have condemned Israel for relying heavily on live ammunition, rather than non-lethal force, and for shooting when its soldiers' lives are not in danger.</p> <p>The Nobel prize-winning US group Physicians for Human Rights blames the widespread use of the M-16 automatic rifle for the high rate of crippling Palestinian injuries. The American-designed weapon is standard issue for Israeli troops.</p> <p>Daniel Reisner, a colonel in the advocate general's office of the Israeli army, admits that some soldiers have broken the undisclosed rules on opening fire.</p> <p>\"Did all cases in which Israeli army soldiers shoot Palestinians involve live fire incidents? I don't think so,\" he said. \"Could it be that some soldiers reacted with more fire than I would have used in hindsight? Maybe. Some of the reports seem to indicate that.\"</p> <p>The chief of staff, General Shauf Mofaz, told comman ders last month to investigate every fatal shooting of a Palestinian by Israeli soldiers in circumstances where there was no12 previous exchange of fire. The army is making criminal investigations in six such cases.</p> <p>Col Reisner argues that many of the soldiers - like a third of the 370 Palestinians killed to date - are practically children themselves. \"These are kids out of high school. We train them, but we can not make them adults in a day.</p> <p>\"In a lot of the incidents with the Palestinians there has been talk about children doing the fighting, and that they were sending 16-year-olds to throw stones or firebombs. We were sending 18-year-olds, only ours are lawful.</p> <p>\"The general staff can give orders, but at the end of the day the person that has to carry out those orders is a 20-year-old kid, and that is in a good situation, with a 22-year-old commanding office, and a 25-year-old company commander.\"</p> <p>The results - particularly when M-16s are used - are devastating.

      "bodyText": "The beds of the four teenagers take up an entire wall at Wafa hospital in Gaza. Tharif Ghora, 16, was shot in the shoulder when he peeked over a barricade at the Karni border crossing on November 19. Hussein Na'ezi, also 16 and with Tharif a regular at the confrontations with Israeli soldiers at Karni, took a bullet in the neck the day before. Ahmed Abu Taha, a stick-thin boy with almond eyes, the baby of the ward at 14, was running from a tank in Rafah refugee camp on February 18 when a bullet penetrated his back. Mahmoud Sarhan, 16, was shot in the neck. None of them will walk again. Hussein and Mahmoud will not even be able to lower themselves into wheelchairs because their injuries are higher up the spinal cord. They - and 1,000 others - are the maimed of the intifada, with permanent injuries which range from a limp or the loss of an eye to paralysis and mental disability: a harvest of mutilation which far outstrips the death toll in the Palestinian uprising. All four of the boys threw stones at Israeli soldiers and tanks - Tharif used to detour past Karni on his way home from school - and all four were unarmed. They, like many of the other injured and dead, are the victims of what the UN security council and international and Israeli human rights groups condemn as excessive use of force by Israel against the uprising, now in its seventh month. A great deal of the criticism has focused on Israel's use of high-velocity bullets fired from M-16 assault rifles. When these penetrate flesh they cartwheel through the body with explosive force. None of the four boys is aware that he will spend the rest of his life as prisoner of his body. In his hospital bed, a beaming Tharif is being fattened up with shwarma, the meat sandwiches his father sells at a roadside stall in Gaza City. There is an involuntary twitch in his swollen left foot. \"You see?\" says his father, Abid Ghora. \"One day, God willing, he will make a full recovery. Maybe if we can send him to Germany, they can do something for him.\" The number of Palestinians left with some form of permanent disability by this uprising is not entirely clear. According to the Palestinian Red Crescent Society, the injured up to two days ago numbered 13,296, 20% of the hit by bullets. The Institute of Community and Public Health at Bir Zeit University, the premier Palestinian academic establishment, sifted through mounds of hospital records to arrive at an estimate of at least 1,000 people who will be permanently afflicted after being hit by Israeli live fire, shrapnel, or rubber-tipped steel bullets. More than 400 of the injured have been treated for lasting disability at three rehabilitation 12centres in the West Bank and Gaza Strip - the only places of their kind for a combined population of 3m people - and at an eye hospital in occupied Arab East Jerusalem. Five hundred of the seriously injured have been treated abroad, including Tharif and Hussein, who were sent to Jordan. In the West Bank town of Beit Jala, Elias Saba, a therapist at the Bethlehem Arab Society for Rehabilitation, is trying to coax a response from Amjed Saadi, 18. \"Marhaba,\" Dr Saba, says to him: hello in Arabic. Sitting in his wheelchair with his right hand clenched in a fist, Mr Saadi grunts twice in reply. The doctor asks him to put a hand on his nose; Mr Saadi shades his eyes. Mr Saadi was shot in the head with a high velocity bullet fired by an Israeli soldier on October 2, in the first few days of the intifada. He woke from his coma five weeks ago with permanent brain damage.His eyes are alert but spinal fluid is collecting in a bulge on the side of his head, and he will need more surgery. Human rights groups have condemned Israel for relying heavily on live ammunition, rather than non-lethal force, and for shooting when its soldiers' lives are not in danger. The Nobel prize-winning US group Physicians for Human Rights blames the widespread use of the M-16 automatic rifle for the high rate of crippling Palestinian injuries. The American-designed weapon is standard issue for Israeli troops. Daniel Reisner, a colonel in the advocate general's office of the Israeli army, admits that some soldiers have broken the undisclosed rules on opening fire. \"Did all cases in which Israeli army soldiers shoot Palestinians involve live fire incidents? I don't think so,\" he said. \"Could it be that some soldiers reacted with more fire than I would have used in hindsight? Maybe. Some of the reports seem to indicate that.\" The chief of staff, General Shauf Mofaz, told comman ders last month to investigate every fatal shooting of a Palestinian by Israeli soldiers in circumstances where there was no12 previous exchange of fire. The army is making criminal investigations in six such cases. Col Reisner argues that many of the soldiers - like a third of the 370 Palestinians killed to date - are practically children themselves. \"These are kids out of high school. We train them, but we can not make them adults in a day. \"In a lot of the incidents with the Palestinians there has been talk about children doing the fighting, and that they were sending 16-year-olds to throw stones or firebombs. We were sending 18-year-olds, only ours are lawful. \"The general staff can give orders, but at the end of the day the person that has to carry out those orders is a 20-year-old kid, and that is in a good situation, with a 22-year-old commanding office, and a 25-year-old company commander.\" The results - particularly when M-16s are used - are devastating. Other high-speed ammunition passes cleanly through the body, but a lightweight 5.56mm bullet from an M-16 tends to tumble and spin after it penetrates the flesh at a speed of more than 800 metres a second. Then it breaks up into tiny metal fragments. \"They move like an insect, buzzing around your body, said Dr Jumaa Saqqa, spokesman for the Shifa hospital in Gaza City, where the territory's worst injuries are treated. \"On the outside of the body you just see a small inlet - one centimetre big - but if there is no exit we find hundreds of small metallic pieces inside.\" Most of the new disabled were hurt during the first three months of the uprising. Hailed as heroes in the early days, and handed cheques for up to $1,000 (\u00a3700) afterwards, they now in danger of being abandoned on the outer margins of a society on the verge of economic collapse, and itself crippled by a corrupt and undemocratic leadership. \"Most of these injured are relatively young,\" said Mohammed Abu Tair, an orthopaedics specialist at Mukassad hospital in Jerusalem, \"the potential labour force - the power of society itself.\" Related articles 27.04.2001: Israeli minister in diplomatic U-turn 26.04.2001: Security alert for independence day 24.04.2001: EU ready to take hard line on Israel 23.04.2001: Europe colludes in Israeli trade scams Useful links Palestinian national authority Office of the Israeli prime minister Jerusalem Post Palestine Times Arabic internet network Ha'aretz",

      "body": "<p>A teenage girl, in teeth braces, grey T-shirt and denim shorts, stands among a crowd in the tiny township of Assiniboia, out on the wide prairie of Saskatchewan. As she waits for the arrival of the man who might one day be her king, she rolls her gum around her mouth. \"It's kind of nice that he's coming,\" she says. \"Really neat. But ... I don't think it will make any difference to me whether he's king or not. Some old people would be really sad but most people here just wouldn't notice.\"</p> <p>A few minutes later, the appearance of a rather gaunt, middle-aged Englishman with a diffident wave and a double-breasted suit, tips the teenage girl into a mild screaming fit. But otherwise there is distinctly modified rapture from the local inhabitants, whose leathery faces bear witness to a hard life in the harsh climate of the central Canadian plains. It is, someone remarks, not so much empire loyalism as small town curiosity that has driven them out to gaze at Prince Charles.</p> <p>This Englishman who may one day inherit the crown of Canada (not that such a thing exists) and become its head of state returns to Britain this morning after a whistlestop five-day sweep through his mother's largest dominion. He's been out there meeting the people like a particularly low-key politician. He has shaken hands with elders representing indigenous tribes, greeted farmers and flown to meet the folks in the far northern Yukon territory, where winter temperatures sink to -60C.</p> <p>Each has been met, in the fleeting seconds he spends with them, with a wry grin, a muttered aside, a shy twisting of the signet ring on his left hand and sometimes a worried stroke of his forehead. He is a man conscious of the need to fly the flag, to cover the ground and to shore up the commonwealth - and, perhaps, to restore the credibility of the monarchy in a country in which, if there is no great move to get rid of it, there is little sense of real support either.</p> <p>Canada remains one of half a dozen commonwealth countries to have the queen as head of state. Although there is not much sign of any move to get rid of her here, people murmur privately that the question may reopen when she dies. For the present though, the Monarchist League, with its complaints about the lack of royal portraits in public buildings, remains a small force to be reckoned with. And a rosy fairy-tale view of the monarchy seems to remain. For a Brit it is almost like stepping back a decade to before the Diana debacle and all the rest - 10 years of disaster that have reawakened and strengthened the republican debate in Britain, and even caused the monarchy to start questioning itself, seem barely to have registered here. Not even Sophiegate has caused comment in Canada: people appear not to know who Sophie is.</p> <p>So once again Charles has been out there, shaking hands and meeting the people and trying on costumes, just as he always has. This is what the more managerial royal courtiers are now calling the Marmite-pot monarchy. It is corpo rate-speak culled from business practice and it is designed quietly to reposition the institution for the 21st century. As one senior palace strategist says: \"The idea is like the Marmite jar: everyone thinks it's never changed its design over the decades but that's because the changes have been so subtle, no one's noticed them. The Marmite jar isn't a bit like it was - it's changed its shape and its top and its label but everyone thinks it's still the same product. That is what we're trying to do with the monarchy.\" But if the Marmite jar is changing it is changing very slowly indeed.</p> <p>The prince's appearance before the actually rather small crowds in Canada, made up largely of the elderly and the very young, had overtones of a medieval progress, with all the laying on of hands and touching of the hems of garments. But there were strict limits to this intimacy. Journalists accompanying the trip were instructed that photographers and cameramen must not approach closer than 20ft. This left us with the curious experience of having less contact with the prince than the most casual passer-by engaged in conversation. We might as well have been watching a play, which I suppose we were.</p> <p>Charles barely spoke publicly during the trip and when he did he confined himself to shoring up the fairy-tale image with references to his beloved grandmother and wry allusions to himself. The number of issues on which he is allowed to speak publicly, or have views on, is small. He tried a reference to holistic health care in a speech to the Saskatchewan parliament, which is considering medical reforms, and he met organic farmers in Assiniboia.</p> <p>\"It is vital to take stock of the long term consequences of industrialised farming systems ... we neglect the delicate balance of the rural community and the need for harmony with the workings of nature at our peril,\" he said in virtually the only comments that might be considered outspoken on the whole trip. Not surprisingly the organic farmers agreed with him, though whether his views have any wider resonance on the open prairie, where grain fields stretch to the far horizon, is questionable.</p> <p>In return for actually meeting him, the grateful citizens bestowed propitiatory honours and gifts to one of the most affluent men on the planet: a teddy bear in a hand-knitted jersey during a walkabout in Sparks Street, Ottawa; a small pot of violets thrust into the prince's hands in the same place; pictures that will not replace the royal Rembrandts; walking sticks to assist the royal stroll round Highgrove; blankets to warm the royal feet in winter; mittens and moccasins made of moose hide and beaver skins; even trouser belts made of rubber reconstituted from old car tyres.</p> <p>And there were also titles to add to those he has already. At the weekend, the prince who, on an earlier visit was named Son of the Big Boss by the Inuit and who has also been called Picanniny Belong Mrs Queen by the natives of Papua New Guinea, was awarded the highest honour the Cree tribe can bestow. The elders retreated into a sweat lodge - local equivalent of a sauna - overnight and the prince's new name was revealed unto elder Gordon Oakes. Charles is now officially Kisikawpisim Kanayowahpahmikoot, which apparently means The Sun Watches Over Him in a Good Way, a translation that delighted the Sun's royal correspondent.</p> <p>Canada's indigenous tribes rather like Charles, possibly more than the white people do. They remember it was his great great great grandmother who first gave them a measure of protection in the 1870s when the Americans across the border were ruthlessly embarking on genocide. Lloyd King, 85 year-old elder of the Ojibway people, waiting to meet Charles in Ottawa, said: \"Offhand I'd say what do I care about a foreigner in our land? We were here first. But you'll find more honour and ceremony and respect in the documents signed between our ancestors and the governors-general and the Great Father than you would find nowadays. In some ways I am still impressed with that.\"</p> <p>Another part of the royal tour ritual is the wearing of funny hats for photographers, just as ceremonial in its way as medals and uniforms used to be. This time, however, there was only one hat. At the tyre recycling plant, the prince's eyes lit up when he saw a white hard hat that was being provided for him. \"At last - a hat!\" he exclaimed, perching it like a small white pimple on top of his head.</p> <p>But there is also a limit to these signs of down-to-earth humanity. Watching closely as the factory tour ended, one could see the prince casually remove his protective gloves and drop them negligently by his side for an aide to catch before they fell to ground.</p> <p>And there are straws in the wind that the prince could not fail to have noticed. \"Say Hi! to William For Me,\" read one placard held aloft in Ottawa. \"Meet Your Future Daughter-in-law,\" read another. In Saskatoon, Saskatchewan's state premier Lorne Calvert effortlessly mortified his 15-year-old daughter Stephanie by telling Charles: \"Come back soon, or send the kids.\" The prince muttered that he would do his best to package his offspring and send them over by parcel post. For it is William the crowds really wanted to see, not their ageing father.</p> <p>Charles will have flown home last night with a warm glow of duty done, but while Canada is nowhere near following Australia down the path towards republicanism there is no real sense of identification with this foreign prince either.</p> <p>But perhaps there is one thing way beyond its powers of control that helps the monarchy here. Senator Frank Mahovlich, a former ice hockey star turned politician, puts it most succinctly: \"The monarchy is something we're an important part of. I like it for our country and I like it partly because it is something the Americans haven't got.\" Whereas in Australia the debate helps shape a sense of national identity, here it still, just, helps define what makes Canada distinctive - and that is not being part of the United States.</p> <p><b>Charles on tour: the highs and the lows</b></p> <p>He's very photogenic, Charles, on his holidays; snapped naked in a hotel window, patting his wife's derriere on a trip to New Zealand, and then, some 10 years later, in South Korea in 1992, the royal couple, looking anywhere but at each other. Then there was the trip to Oz in 1994, which saw David Kang, aged 23, firing blanks at the prince with a starting gun during a ceremony in Sydney.</p> <p>There was more photo magic in South Africa, when he tackled the bongo drums. Xhosa tribal dancer, Nick Madlebe said: \"The prince was a very good drummer and had a natural sense of rhythm.\"</p> <p>Mr Madlebe was right. On a trip to Buenos Aires in 1999, we witnessed the lovely Adriana Vasile tangoing with the prince, resplendent in fishnets, red lipstick and a dress split thigh-high (Ms Vasile, you understand, not the prince).</p> <p>Not that Charles is a stranger to donning a nation's traditional costume. Last year he insisted upon wearing a Rastafarian hat backwards. He has something of a soft spot for headgear: over the years he has sported eagle-feathered titfers, trilbies, woolly hats and even, in Krygyzstan, a kakelpak - whatever that may be.</p> <p>And it doesn't end there, for the Prince of Wales has made continued efforts to blend with the natives, sipping jungle root brew as if it were Darjeeling, in deepest, darkest Guyana. On the last day of his 1993 Mexican tour, he even tried his hand at troughing - working a wooden-bladed plough pulled by two bullocks. After ploughing two furrows he called it a day, declaring: \"I am upset that I do not have time to do some more ploughing.\" Aren't we all, Charles.</p>",

He is there to plug this month's BBC Music Live weekend in Leeds, but mentions en passant his Hyde Park appearance with Pavarotti in July, an engagement to sing for the Pope, the theme song he has recorded for the film of Captain Corelli's Mandolin, his imminent US tour, his new album (to be released in September), a Christmas concert in Manchester, and something or other with Spice Girl Mel C. I look impressed, if a little confused, as I try to imagine other possible links between the Pope, Pavarotti and Mel C.</p> <p>Watson is also appearing on that evening's BBC news in the north-west. The presenter talks to him as if he were an old friend: his two-year march to superstardom has been minutely chronicled hereabouts. On the way to the studio, we bump into Roger Wright, the controller of Radio 3, in the lift, and he introduces himself to Watson. I reflect on this symbolic (and entirely accidental) meeting of posh and pop, and wonder if it will result in Watson and Mel C duetting together on future editions of In Tune. Possibly introduced by the Pope.</p> <p>Watson prides himself on his skill as an interviewee. He has just been on a tour of Japan, where, he says, he had to do dozens of interviews with journalists who insist on their hour even if they have nothing to ask. This puts me on my mettle, and I busily ask inconsequential questions about his pre-stardom life that he must have answered a thousand times before. He looks unfazed and goes through his repertoire of funny northern accents and time-honoured working-men's-club stories.</p> <p>He learned piano and guitar as a child, but says he preferred football, and his only exposure to classical music came from the records of Chopin waltzes that his parents liked to play. He became a steelworker, but at 21 entered a local talent competition, won and started singing in pubs and clubs, soon afterwards abandoning his lathe for the bright lights of Batley and Goole. High spots included appearing in Cinderella at the Bradford Alhambra and a summer season with Lily Savage in Blackpool. It all sounds grimly Les Dawson-ish, and it lasted for 10 years (or perhaps three if you trust the record company).</p> <p>\"There were times when I thought about chucking it in, but I kept batting away,\" he says. \"There were clubs where the audience wasn't interested in me in any way, shape or form, and I'd be stood on stage singing my heart out thinking, 'What the bloody hell am I doing up here?' It's like anything: you have your good days and your bad days, and the good days were good and the bad days were terrible.\"</p> <p>He sang a mixture of Neil Diamond, Elvis Presley and \"West End classical\" (Phantom, Les Mis), depending on the sophistication of the venue. \"I learned how to assess an audience when I walked in,\" he says. \"One of the things that makes me different is that I've gone through this club route, and I wouldn't change that for anything. It made me a different person. It taught me how to communicate with audiences and bring an audience round.\"</p> <p>Enter fate, in the form of the club secretary of the Wigan Road Working Men's Club, who suggested Watson sing Nesty Doormat by Pavarotti. He did, won a standing ovation and realised that his future lay in operatic blockbusters rather than Neil Diamond torch songs. That club secretary ought now by rights to be head of A&amp;R at Decca International, which has sold 800,000 copies of The Voice in the UK alone. It has been top of the classical charts since it was released last September and made substantial inroads into the pop album charts too. As Melvyn Bragg perceptively noted, Watson is \"a phenomenon\".</p> <p>When Watson changed his repertoire, he also decided to get some vocal coaching, and is currently under the tutelage of William Hayward. \"When I first went to Bill, he said that if I continued to sing the way I was - forte and full on all the time - I would burn myself out, so I had to go on to develop the lighter side of the voice and inject some light and shade into my music.\"</p> <p>Watson didn't get his big break until 1999, when he was singing at a charity evening in Manchester. Martin Edwards, the chairman of Manchester United, was in the audience and invited him to sing Nessun Dorma at Old Trafford, which he did before the last game of the season. Watson, a lifelong Man U fan, almost certainly did not sleep the night before. \"I walked on to the pitch and nobody was taking much notice,\" he recalls, \"but when I started singing, the buzz from the crowd began to die down and I could feel people were beginning to think, 'Who is this guy?' By the end, when I hit the top note, the whole place erupted. I felt like David Beckham on the edge of the 18-yard box after curling one in to the top left-hand corner.\"</p> <p>Watson sang at England rugby union matches, at the European Cup final in Barcelona, and before England's World Cup match with Germany at Wembley. (He was one of the few participants to escape censure for that ignominious defeat.) An enterprising producer introduced him to Decca, and there followed another of those moments that belong to Broadway fantasy rather than Salford reality.</p> <p>\"There were eight or nine executives from Decca,\" Watson recalls, \"and they asked me if I'd brought a CD or video for them to hear. I said, 'No, but I have brought my voice.' I burst into O Sole Mio, holding the top note and, like the cheeky bugger I am, looking at my watch at the same time. I held it longer than I had ever held it before. Their jaws dropped gradually to the floor and that was it: I walked out of the office and within an hour there was a fax back in Manchester with an offer of a five-album deal.\"</p> <p>Success has brought fame, fortune and a broken marriage. Watson was all over the tabloids in March when he split with his wife, Helen. It is clearly a horrible situation, and for a moment Watson's jovial persona is punctured. All that matters, he says, is the well-being of their two children.</p> <p>The past year looks, to this observer at least, to have been a kind of madness. He says he hasn't changed as a person, and quotes a rehearsal in Manchester where he was tucking into a meat pie while everyone else picked at sushi. Maybe, but being separated from your daughter of five months must be desperate, and at some stage he will have to learn to say no. Even if it means disappointing Japanese journalists, record executives eager to squeeze a little more from their \"27-year-old\" superstar, and the Pope. At least the Pope will understand.</p> <p>\u0095 Russell Watson will sing in Millennium Square, Leeds, on May 25 as part of BBC Music Live. For tickets call 0113-244 4600. He will also perform at the Classical Brits on May 31. Visit <a href=\"http://www.classicalbrits.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">Classical Brits</a> to vote.</p>",

This puts me on my mettle, and I busily ask inconsequential questions about his pre-stardom life that he must have answered a thousand times before. He looks unfazed and goes through his repertoire of funny northern accents and time-honoured working-men's-club stories. He learned piano and guitar as a child, but says he preferred football, and his only exposure to classical music came from the records of Chopin waltzes that his parents liked to play. He became a steelworker, but at 21 entered a local talent competition, won and started singing in pubs and clubs, soon afterwards abandoning his lathe for the bright lights of Batley and Goole. High spots included appearing in Cinderella at the Bradford Alhambra and a summer season with Lily Savage in Blackpool. It all sounds grimly Les Dawson-ish, and it lasted for 10 years (or perhaps three if you trust the record company). \"There were times when I thought about chucking it in, but I kept batting away,\" he says. \"There were clubs where the audience wasn't interested in me in any way, shape or form, and I'd be stood on stage singing my heart out thinking, 'What the bloody hell am I doing up here?' It's like anything: you have your good days and your bad days, and the good days were good and the bad days were terrible.\" He sang a mixture of Neil Diamond, Elvis Presley and \"West End classical\" (Phantom, Les Mis), depending on the sophistication of the venue. \"I learned how to assess an audience when I walked in,\" he says. \"One of the things that makes me different is that I've gone through this club route, and I wouldn't change that for anything. It made me a different person. It taught me how to communicate with audiences and bring an audience round.\" Enter fate, in the form of the club secretary of the Wigan Road Working Men's Club, who suggested Watson sing Nesty Doormat by Pavarotti. He did, won a standing ovation and realised that his future lay in operatic blockbusters rather than Neil Diamond torch songs. That club secretary ought now by rights to be head of A&amp;R at Decca International, which has sold 800,000 copies of The Voice in the UK alone. It has been top of the classical charts since it was released last September and made substantial inroads into the pop album charts too. As Melvyn Bragg perceptively noted, Watson is \"a phenomenon\". When Watson changed his repertoire, he also decided to get some vocal coaching, and is currently under the tutelage of William Hayward. \"When I first went to Bill, he said that if I continued to sing the way I was - forte and full on all the time - I would burn myself out, so I had to go on to develop the lighter side of the voice and inject some light and shade into my music.\" Watson didn't get his big break until 1999, when he was singing at a charity evening in Manchester. Martin Edwards, the chairman of Manchester United, was in the audience and invited him to sing Nessun Dorma at Old Trafford, which he did before the last game of the season. Watson, a lifelong Man U fan, almost certainly did not sleep the night before. \"I walked on to the pitch and nobody was taking much notice,\" he recalls, \"but when I started singing, the buzz from the crowd began to die down and I could feel people were beginning to think, 'Who is this guy?' By the end, when I hit the top note, the whole place erupted. I felt like David Beckham on the edge of the 18-yard box after curling one in to the top left-hand corner.\" Watson sang at England rugby union matches, at the European Cup final in Barcelona, and before England's World Cup match with Germany at Wembley. (He was one of the few participants to escape censure for that ignominious defeat.) An enterprising producer introduced him to Decca, and there followed another of those moments that belong to Broadway fantasy rather than Salford reality. \"There were eight or nine executives from Decca,\" Watson recalls, \"and they asked me if I'd brought a CD or video for them to hear. I said, 'No, but I have brought my voice.' I burst into O Sole Mio, holding the top note and, like the cheeky bugger I am, looking at my watch at the same time. I held it longer than I had ever held it before. Their jaws dropped gradually to the floor and that was it: I walked out of the office and within an hour there was a fax back in Manchester with an offer of a five-album deal.\" Success has brought fame, fortune and a broken marriage. Watson was all over the tabloids in March when he split with his wife, Helen. It is clearly a horrible situation, and for a moment Watson's jovial persona is punctured. All that matters, he says, is the well-being of their two children. The past year looks, to this observer at least, to have been a kind of madness. He says he hasn't changed as a person, and quotes a rehearsal in Manchester where he was tucking into a meat pie while everyone else picked at sushi. Maybe, but being separated from your daughter of five months must be desperate, and at some stage he will have to learn to say no. Even if it means disappointing Japanese journalists, record executives eager to squeeze a little more from their \"27-year-old\" superstar, and the Pope. At least the Pope will understand. \u0095 Russell Watson will sing in Millennium Square, Leeds, on May 25 as part of BBC Music Live. For tickets call 0113-244 4600. He will also perform at the Classical Brits on May 31. Visit Classical Brits to vote.",

He changed roles - ending up as Vladimir - just before rehearsals began. But although he looked at home in all kinds of play, he did not reach those heights for which he had seemed destined at the Old Vic in the 1950s and 1960s, when he brought what the young Kenneth Tynan called \"a touching bewilderment\" to Henry VI in Douglas Seale's legendary revival of Shakespeare's trilogy (1957).</p> <p>He also acted a witty and unsentimentalised Justice Shallow in Henry IV - \"a forked radish of a man with a rambling tongue, a senile reiteration but a shrewd eye still to the main chance and possible court advancement,\" as one reviewer put it.</p> <p>JW Lambert wrote: \"It is not clear to me how an actor whom I recall as an extremely well set up Aufidius [in Coriolanus] has transformed himself into a twig-limbed old silly.\" But then Daneman was a supremely good exponent of doddering silliness - or the younger variety, such as the self-torturing, anxious lover, Faukland, in Sheridan's The Rivals, whose complicated character he refused to explore too seriously, settling instead for just the right level of what a critic called \"inflated Byronism.\"</p> <p>Or what about his suave young aristocrat in BBC-TV's Corrigan Blake (1963), the breezy sidekick to John Turner's cockney layabout? He is remembered also as Commander Ryan, in the BBC's Spytrap (1972), as the suburban patriarch opposite Wendy Craig in Not In Front of the Children (1967), and, a year later, in another television domestic comedy, Never A Cross Word, playing opposite Nyree Dawn Porter (Obituary, April 12).</p> <p>These performance were a long way from the feverish vitality of the deplorable Duberdat, in the Doctor's Dilemma (Saville, 1956), or his long-nosed Richard III at Birmingham Rep in the 1950s (which he repeated at the Old Vic in 1962), or his princely Malcolm to Paul Rogers's Macbeth.</p> <p>Born in London, Daneman was educated at Haberdashers' Aske' school in Borehamwood, and Sir William Borlase's school in Marlow, Buckinghamshire. He then read fine art at Reading University. From 1943-47, he served in RAF Bomber Command, where stage performances for fellow service-men whetted his appetite for the theatre. Then came Rada and a Boxing Day 1947 debut, at Bromley's New Theatre, as the front legs of a horse in Alice In Wonderland.</p> <p>In the early 1960s, he was Christopher Marlowe's Dr Faustus and Richard III with the Old Vic, before joining the Nottingham Playhouse, with which he toured west Africa. He also played King Arthur, in Lerner and Loewe's Camelot, touring Australia before taking over from Laurence Harvey at Drury Lane (1965), after starring in CP Snow's The New Men, at the Strand.</p> <p>It was not in Daneman's nature to stray for long from the classics, though television was, by then, a force in the land. In order to keep abreast of the theatre, he had a way of turning up in all kind of West End plays, thrillers and farces. When, in 1979, he took over from Donald Sinden in Shut Your Eyes and Think Of England, he had a heart attack while tending one of the characters in the play who was supposed to have suffered the same thing.</p> <p>So he turned to writing. His television sitcom, Affairs Of The Heart (1985) starred Derek Fowlds as a man who had had a heart attack. His novel, If I Only Had Wings, was published in 1995.</p> <p>Another role which the versatile Daneman assumed was Rolfe, which Alec McCowen had created, in Hadrian The Seventh (Haymarket, 1969), in which the character's dream of being the first English pope seemed, to him, to have come true. Later stage credits were Don't Start Without Me (Garrick, 1971), Macbeth (Guildford), Henry Higgins in Pygmalion (Malvern), Double Edge (Vaudeville) and Spine Chiller (Duke of York's).</p> <p>Among other television credits were The Professionals (1977), Alan Bleasdale's GBH (1991), and as Douglas Hird in Thatcher: The Final Days (1991). His films included Joseph Losey's Time Without Pity (1956), Cy Endfield's Zulu (1964), and Dick Lester's How I Won The War (1967).</p> <p>His 1952 marriage to Susan Courtney, with whom he adopted a daughter, ended in divorce. He is survived by his second wife, Meredith, and their two daughters.</p> <p>\u0095 Paul Daneman, actor, born October 26 1925; died April 28 2001</p>",

From 1943-47, he served in RAF Bomber Command, where stage performances for fellow service-men whetted his appetite for the theatre. Then came Rada and a Boxing Day 1947 debut, at Bromley's New Theatre, as the front legs of a horse in Alice In Wonderland. In the early 1960s, he was Christopher Marlowe's Dr Faustus and Richard III with the Old Vic, before joining the Nottingham Playhouse, with which he toured west Africa. He also played King Arthur, in Lerner and Loewe's Camelot, touring Australia before taking over from Laurence Harvey at Drury Lane (1965), after starring in CP Snow's The New Men, at the Strand. It was not in Daneman's nature to stray for long from the classics, though television was, by then, a force in the land. In order to keep abreast of the theatre, he had a way of turning up in all kind of West End plays, thrillers and farces. When, in 1979, he took over from Donald Sinden in Shut Your Eyes and Think Of England, he had a heart attack while tending one of the characters in the play who was supposed to have suffered the same thing. So he turned to writing. His television sitcom, Affairs Of The Heart (1985) starred Derek Fowlds as a man who had had a heart attack. His novel, If I Only Had Wings, was published in 1995. Another role which the versatile Daneman assumed was Rolfe, which Alec McCowen had created, in Hadrian The Seventh (Haymarket, 1969), in which the character's dream of being the first English pope seemed, to him, to have come true. Later stage credits were Don't Start Without Me (Garrick, 1971), Macbeth (Guildford), Henry Higgins in Pygmalion (Malvern), Double Edge (Vaudeville) and Spine Chiller (Duke of York's). Among other television credits were The Professionals (1977), Alan Bleasdale's GBH (1991), and as Douglas Hird in Thatcher: The Final Days (1991). His films included Joseph Losey's Time Without Pity (1956), Cy Endfield's Zulu (1964), and Dick Lester's How I Won The War (1967). His 1952 marriage to Susan Courtney, with whom he adopted a daughter, ended in divorce. He is survived by his second wife, Meredith, and their two daughters. \u0095 Paul Daneman, actor, born October 26 1925; died April 28 2001",

The BBC has admitted that it has not paid enough attention to its more mature viewers and is to produce a raft of shows - particularly on BBC2 - for this market.</p> <p>Nigel Havers, Steve Coogan and Paul Whitehouse will star in three comedy series for which divorce and desire will be the new broadcasting buzzwords.</p> <p>Jane Root, controller of BBC2, said she wanted to provide more \"sophisticated, intelligent, educated entertainment\". She recognised that there were shows, such as the music programme Trevor Nelson's Urban Choice, that said \"piss off if you're over 30\".</p> <p>But BBC2's \"centre of gravity\", she said, was around age 35. As more viewers were able to reach other BBC networks, such as the digital youth and entertainment channel BBC Choice, BBC2 could concentrate on a more discerning audience.</p> <p>\"There is not a u-turn but a slight shift towards an audience which has not really been concentrated upon in the past,\" Ms Root said at the Golden Rose television festival in Montreux.</p> <p>Earlier at the festival it was revealed that the BBC had signed up the former Big Breakfast star Johnny Vaughan in a \u00a33m deal.</p> <p>It almost clinched the Channel 4 presenter Graham Norton with an offer worth \u00a34m, the Guardian has learned.</p> <p>The first of the three new comedies commissioned, Manchild, written by the teen magazine agony uncle Nick Fisher, stars Nigel Havers, Anthony Head, Ray Burdis and the former Rising Damp actor Don Warrington.</p> <p>They play four middle aged men who appear to have forgotten their age. \"It's Sex in the City for the Viagra generation,\" a BBC source said.</p> <p>The show is likely to reinvent the television career of Havers, who has tended to play upper-class cads.

      "bodyText": "Broadcasters are rediscovering the \"Viagra generation\", after years of pursuing the lucrative youth audience. The BBC has admitted that it has not paid enough attention to its more mature viewers and is to produce a raft of shows - particularly on BBC2 - for this market. Nigel Havers, Steve Coogan and Paul Whitehouse will star in three comedy series for which divorce and desire will be the new broadcasting buzzwords. Jane Root, controller of BBC2, said she wanted to provide more \"sophisticated, intelligent, educated entertainment\". She recognised that there were shows, such as the music programme Trevor Nelson's Urban Choice, that said \"piss off if you're over 30\". But BBC2's \"centre of gravity\", she said, was around age 35. As more viewers were able to reach other BBC networks, such as the digital youth and entertainment channel BBC Choice, BBC2 could concentrate on a more discerning audience. \"There is not a u-turn but a slight shift towards an audience which has not really been concentrated upon in the past,\" Ms Root said at the Golden Rose television festival in Montreux. Earlier at the festival it was revealed that the BBC had signed up the former Big Breakfast star Johnny Vaughan in a \u00a33m deal. It almost clinched the Channel 4 presenter Graham Norton with an offer worth \u00a34m, the Guardian has learned. The first of the three new comedies commissioned, Manchild, written by the teen magazine agony uncle Nick Fisher, stars Nigel Havers, Anthony Head, Ray Burdis and the former Rising Damp actor Don Warrington. They play four middle aged men who appear to have forgotten their age. \"It's Sex in the City for the Viagra generation,\" a BBC source said. The show is likely to reinvent the television career of Havers, who has tended to play upper-class cads. Sophie Clarke-Jervoise, the producer, said of the characters: \"They think they are the coolest guys, but in fact they make complete prats of themselves.\" Steve Coogan has written a \"prequel\" to his acclaimed comedy Marion and Geoff, titled A Small Summer Party. The original series charted the breakdown of Marion's marriage and her relationship with Geoff. In the prequel, Geoff will be seen for the first time, played by Coogan. There are also plans for a second series of Happiness, the dark comedy from the Fast Show's Paul Whitehouse, in which he plays a voice-over actor experiencing a mid-life crisis. And in a nod to the theme of appealing to older viewers, the 1960s star Twiggy is to make a guest appearance in the new series of Absolutely Fabulous. Danielle Lux, controller of entertainment commissioning, said there was room across all BBC channels for \"a range of programmes as wide as the tastes of the British public, and as diverse as the ambitions of the artists we work with\". But Ms Root insisted that certain youth-oriented shows were safe on BBC2 for the foreseeable future: \"The thought of the Robot Wars viewers of Britain marching on Television Centre is not appealing.\"",

I've seen him addressed as Sir Paul to his face on television (and Cliff Richard as Sir Cliff) and I feel embarrassed on behalf of both the interviewer and the lord or knight or whatever he has become. The Beatles were part of my youth and Sir Paul McCartney is no longer the same person as Paul McCartney of Lennon and McCartney, the Beatles - it is as if I've been robbed of something.</p> <p>The delight with which Michael Caine received his title was ghastly to behold. I loathe the word \"Sir\", except as used by a child to their teacher. Whenever someone accepts a knighthood they are reinforcing the pyramid of privilege that sits above us. <br><b> Michael Farley </b><br> Yelverton, Devon <br></p> <p>\u0095 Why stop at titles? The whole honours system rewards supposedly eminent persons with what are now completely remote, pretentious and defunct titles. As far as I am aware, knights, with their shining armour, and cavalries, disappeared with the Middles Ages, and the British empire (OBEs, CBEs etc) is no longer in existence. As for dames, they sound more like the names of pantomime characters than real-life people.

I've seen him addressed as Sir Paul to his face on television (and Cliff Richard as Sir Cliff) and I feel embarrassed on behalf of both the interviewer and the lord or knight or whatever he has become. The Beatles were part of my youth and Sir Paul McCartney is no longer the same person as Paul McCartney of Lennon and McCartney, the Beatles - it is as if I've been robbed of something. The delight with which Michael Caine received his title was ghastly to behold. I loathe the word \"Sir\", except as used by a child to their teacher. Whenever someone accepts a knighthood they are reinforcing the pyramid of privilege that sits above us. Michael Farley Yelverton, Devon \u0095 Why stop at titles? The whole honours system rewards supposedly eminent persons with what are now completely remote, pretentious and defunct titles. As far as I am aware, knights, with their shining armour, and cavalries, disappeared with the Middles Ages, and the British empire (OBEs, CBEs etc) is no longer in existence. As for dames, they sound more like the names of pantomime characters than real-life people.

Alfred the Great (871-899) was the King of Wessex who in 878 set out from his residence in Athelney to win his great victory over the Danes at Ethandun. The fact that Alfred was the only king able to read until Henry I (1100-35), over 200 years later, shows that today's learned scribes should study Anglo-Saxon history, and maybe learn a few facts, such as Wessex did and does exist - the water from our taps from Dorset westward is Wessex water.
