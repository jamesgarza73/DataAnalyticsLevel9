It was first performed in 1943 as the Nazi armies began to retreat from Russia, and the Soviet authorities, expecting another call to arms after the fashion of the Leningrad Symphony, loathed it. Shostakovich, however, had gone beyond his earlier all- important demand for anti-fascist resistance to contemplate the effects of atrocity and its aftermath. He famously remarked that the symphony was \"an attempt to look towards the post-war age\", but the end result evokes a physical and cultural landscape gutted and ravaged beyond repair, and explores an emotional territory that passes through the absolute extremes of human suffering into the numbed void that lies beyond pain. It's so intense that some conductors shirk its implications, either by attempting to inject humour into its scherzos or by trying to find some sort of lyrical consolation in the instrumental solos that separate its shouts of agony. Bernard Haitink, however, stares unblinkingly into its depths and offers us no such hope. He takes it extremely slowly, emphasising the subtle ferocity of Shostakovich's harmonic and orchestral palette. The symphony swings not between discord and consonance, but between discord and irresolute emptiness. The denuded spaces that lie between the meandering phrases of the opening slowly fill with excruciating dissonances that seem to hover in the air. Lyricism is relentlessly soured by shrillness. The brass chords that repeatedly silence the screaming woodwind cut into you like knives. The best performance of the work I've ever heard, it was unendurable, as it should be, and I'm not sure I want to sit through its like again for a while. The LSO played as if their lives depended on it and at the end Haitink, desperately moved, looked as if he was about to break down. The shock that the performance generated was intensified by Haitink's decision to juxtapose it with the humane playfulness of Haydn's B Flat Sinfonia Concertante, mischievously written for a curious line-up of soloists - oboe, cello, bassoon, though the lion's share goes to the violinist, who, in the final section, virtually goes it alone and almost turns the work into a concerto. It was done with tremendous warmth and tenderness, coupled with virtuoso playing, particularly from the LSO's leader Gordon Nikolitch and generating throughout an atmosphere of safety and certainty. The contrast with Shostakovich's vision of devastation couldn't have been more telling.</p>",

Billion Dollar Babies by Bob Greene</strong><br>On tour with Alice Cooper in 1973, by a bemused Chicago newspaperjournalist. Hilarious analysis of spoilt rock-star lifestyle makes it one of the best on-the-road books ever.<br><strong><br>2. STP: A Journey Through America with the Rolling Stones by Robert Greenfield</strong><br>The Stones on their famously excessive 1972 tour. Greenfield had complete access and doesn't hesitate to reveal Jagger and friends in all their whingeing glory. Great sense of time and place, too.</p> <p><strong>3. Powder by Kevin Sampson</strong><br>Novel by the former manager of The Farm concerning a fictitious Liverpool band's rise and fall. Lots of really gross sex and drugs details: a salutary tale.</p> <p><strong>4. Groupie by Jenny Fabian, Johnny Byrne and Jonathon Green</strong><br>Cultish swinging 60s novel (recently republished) of a London pop fan who's not satisfied with just an autograph. Fabian was a real-life groupie, and got to know some of the era's stars very well indeed. Half the fun is working out who's who behind the pseudonyms.</p> <p><strong>5. I'm With the Band by Pamela Des Barres</strong><br>Des Barres is a California version of Fabian - except that she names names and rates performance (Jimmy Page gets five stars). Well-written, too, with a great sense of humour.</p> <p><strong>6. Everything: A Book About the Manic Street Preachers by Simon Price</strong><br>The definitive story of the most passionately loved band of the 90s, with lots of hitherto unpublished information about Richey Edwards's disappearance. The best rock biography of the decade.</p> <p><strong>7. Diary of a Rock'n'Roll Star by Ian Hunter</strong><br>Mott the Hoople's lead singer is no Dostoevsky, but his story of a 1972 US tour is straight from the poodle-permed horse's mouth.</p> <p><strong>8.

      "bodyText": "Caroline Sullivan is a Guardian feature writer and pop critic. Bye Bye Baby: My Tragic Love Affair with the Bay City Rollers is published by Bloomsbury. Buy Bye Bye Baby at Amazon.co.uk 1. Billion Dollar Babies by Bob Greene On tour with Alice Cooper in 1973, by a bemused Chicago newspaperjournalist. Hilarious analysis of spoilt rock-star lifestyle makes it one of the best on-the-road books ever. 2. STP: A Journey Through America with the Rolling Stones by Robert Greenfield The Stones on their famously excessive 1972 tour. Greenfield had complete access and doesn't hesitate to reveal Jagger and friends in all their whingeing glory. Great sense of time and place, too. 3. Powder by Kevin Sampson Novel by the former manager of The Farm concerning a fictitious Liverpool band's rise and fall. Lots of really gross sex and drugs details: a salutary tale. 4. Groupie by Jenny Fabian, Johnny Byrne and Jonathon Green Cultish swinging 60s novel (recently republished) of a London pop fan who's not satisfied with just an autograph. Fabian was a real-life groupie, and got to know some of the era's stars very well indeed. Half the fun is working out who's who behind the pseudonyms. 5. I'm With the Band by Pamela Des Barres Des Barres is a California version of Fabian - except that she names names and rates performance (Jimmy Page gets five stars). Well-written, too, with a great sense of humour. 6. Everything: A Book About the Manic Street Preachers by Simon Price The definitive story of the most passionately loved band of the 90s, with lots of hitherto unpublished information about Richey Edwards's disappearance. The best rock biography of the decade. 7. Diary of a Rock'n'Roll Star by Ian Hunter Mott the Hoople's lead singer is no Dostoevsky, but his story of a 1972 US tour is straight from the poodle-permed horse's mouth. 8. The Rolling Stone Album Guide ed Anthony Decurtis Acerbic, colloquial dissertations on virtually every album ever released make this worth reading in its own right. 9. Starlust by Fred and Judy Vermorel This husband and wife pop-culture team analyse fan worship through interviews, diaries and letters. There are some strange people out there, and they all love Nick Heyward of Haircut 100... 10. I Hate Rock' n' Roll by Tony Tyler A former NME hack who, as the title says, hates rock 'n' roll. Excrutiatingly funny, and probably out of print due to its sacrilegous theme.",

The deal will add 200,000 Bank One credit card customers - many acquired through \"affinity\" deals with football clubs including Manchester City, Bristol City and Cardiff City - to Halifax's 1.2m card holders. The Bank One brand will disappear. Until now Halifax has been a relatively small player in Britain's credit card market, charging 18.9% on its Visa card compared with 10.9% at the current market leader Egg and 14.6% at rival Nationwide Building Society. Bank One's standard rate is 18%. Dick Spelman, chief executive of Halifax Retail Financial Services said: \"Credit cards will be a key part of Halifax's plans to diversify away from its traditional dependency on mortgages and savings.

And there were no pit-stops on this outing. The audience were already raring to go, having been warmed up by violinist Omar Puente and his Eclipse band's flares and swoops, snatches of Czardes, wistful violin-guitar duets and witty piano-tag. Elias certainly knows how to pick a good band. Brazilian-born and classically trained, she started out with Eddie Gomez, played with Steps Ahead in the early 80s and worked with Herbie Hancock and Antonio Carlos Jobim, recording two Jobim collections. Marc Johnson on bass and Satoshi Takeishi on drums were clearly in the premier league, but at times they seemed incidental to Elias's compelling journey. Her first two numbers were from her latest album - the Cole Porter title track, Everything I Love, and Charlie Mingus's wonderful Nostalgia in Times Square, which she rendered with slinky chromatic precision. She introduced pieces with a pensive conversation between hands, a dainty, enquiring and impatient dialogue surrendering finally to theme or rhythm. In a Jobim medley, her stride bassline led the way for a splash of brass. Then, in the emotive The Way You Love Me, she got quite jittery with excitement. It was like watching a drunken tramp as we held our breath, waiting to see which way she would reel. A drum solo recovered the balance, to which Elias added - gracefully, mind - the occasional wilful plonk. A Gershwin concoction saw her slamming out slicks of melody, using both ends of the piano to fantastic effect. Later she used her fingers less as hammers than levers, pulling out sounds like a harpist. The Time is Now and Jobim's Desafinado gave Johnson a chance to shine: a low bass refrain in the first gave a sinister underhang to his skittering fingers, and then a high range in the second conjured great musty, moonlit patches of sound. Elias sang only once - a husky ballad, picked out sparingly - but it was a restful interlude in an evening defined by coiled energy. </p>",

The left-handed Elliott was out near the end as he slogged to square leg after four sixes and 17 fours. Both batsmen scored at a run a ball as Dorset's bowlers were remorselessly caned.

He could not have pushed Worcestershire over the line on his own, however, and with 47 needed from the last eight the side were grateful to the veteran Illingworth for his 25 from 29 balls. Earlier, Gloucestershire had finished about 20 runs short of their expectations. But on a slow, difficult pitch, they crashed the gears whenever they attempted to accelerate. Rob Cunliffe scored his first one-day fifty and Jack Russell, surprisingly, only his second in this competition, a cheeky, 102-ball 84. \u0095 Warwickshire came closest to suffering an upset as they allowed the Essex Board to within 11 runs of their modest 214 for eight at Billericay. The opener Nick Carlier made 56 for the club cricketers.",

Yet Cronje's demeanour was surprisingly upbeat throughout, and his recollection of facts and figures nothing short of outstanding. </p> <p>Asked by his own defence counsel Malcolm Wallis to detail how much money he had earned during his playing career, he easily recalled all the figures and where it was invested, from his NatWest bank account in Leicester to an overseas investment account with Merril Lynch in London. </p> <p>This made his later claim that he knew nothing of a payment of R139,000 (\u00a313,500), made to his South African building society account on January 15 1997, extraordinary.

I do love money but I assure you, every time I walked on to the field I gave my all.\" It was a crushing admission of character failure, and he knew it. </p> <p>With scant regard for his reputation, which Cronje clearly believes will never be repaired, he detailed the frugality of his lifestyle. He said his team-mates would vouch for the fact that he \"was never the first to bring his wallet out for a round of drinks\". In fact, he said, his cost of living was \"very low, because I lived at home with my parents and because of the generosity of South African restaurant owners and friends\". </p> <p>Recounting the day in 1995 when the mysterious figure known as \"John\" first asked Cronje if he was interested in fixing a match result - the final of the Mandela Cup against Pakistan in Cape Town - Cronje said: \"I wish I could say I told him to get lost, or jump off the building, because if I had my life would have been very different and I would not find myself in this terrible position today. But I didn't. I said I would go back to my room and think about it.\" </p> <p>He did not take the money on that occasion, but in the world of sports betting, where bookmakers and pun ters will stop at nothing to gain an edge, word spread quickly that Cronje was weak and was a definite target for the future. </p> <p>As the day's cross-examination went on, Cronje's demeanour improved markedly, and by the end he was even making attempts at humour. Today, however, the pressure will intensify again as the commission's chief \"prosecutor\" Shamila Batohi takes her turn to cross-examine him. </p> <p>She was distinctly unimpressed by Dr Lewis's warnings of Cronje's mental frailty, wondering aloud whether his depressed state had prevented Cronje from playing cricket or, cuttingly, \"golf at Fancourt\", the luxury country-club estate on which he purchased a house recently after transferring funds from bank accounts around the world. </p> <p>Nevertheless, Cronje's performance in the stand yesterday suggests that further dramatic revelations are unlikely today.</p>",

I said I would go back to my room and think about it.\" He did not take the money on that occasion, but in the world of sports betting, where bookmakers and pun ters will stop at nothing to gain an edge, word spread quickly that Cronje was weak and was a definite target for the future. As the day's cross-examination went on, Cronje's demeanour improved markedly, and by the end he was even making attempts at humour. Today, however, the pressure will intensify again as the commission's chief \"prosecutor\" Shamila Batohi takes her turn to cross-examine him. She was distinctly unimpressed by Dr Lewis's warnings of Cronje's mental frailty, wondering aloud whether his depressed state had prevented Cronje from playing cricket or, cuttingly, \"golf at Fancourt\", the luxury country-club estate on which he purchased a house recently after transferring funds from bank accounts around the world. Nevertheless, Cronje's performance in the stand yesterday suggests that further dramatic revelations are unlikely today.",

      "bodyText": "\u0095 Tournament organisers, while breathing a sigh of relief at the exit of England and Germany and their accompanying hooligans, have said they will continue with the policy of zero tolerance towards any football-related unrest. The Belgian newspaper La Derni\u00e8re Heure echoed the sentiments of many in Brussels and Charleroi with its front-page headline of Hooligans, Go Home! \"Taking account of the numerous incidents in the last few days,\" the paper continued, \"it is with some relief that we see the English players and above all their supporters going home.\" Monique de Knop, an official from the interior ministry, said: \"After the incidents we saw before the tournament and at the start, there was tension in several towns. I presume that tension will be much less now. \"That is not to say that these [Germany and England] are the only countries that cause problems. There are hooligans from many nations, so we will not be letting our guard down.\" \u0095 Gheorghe Popescu, stretchered off after 32 minutes of Romania's 3-2 victory over England, will miss the rest of the tournament with an injury to his left thigh. The defender ruptured a muscle and Romania's coach Emerich Ienei said that he would need four weeks to recover. Also definitely out of Romania's quarter-final against Italy on Saturday evening are the striker Adrian Ilie, wing-back Dan Petrescu and defender Cosmin Contra, who all picked up their second yellow cards of the tournament on Tuesday. \u0095 Filip de Wilde, largely blamed for Belgium's premature exit from the tournament they are co-hosting, has been given a two-match suspension by Uefa for being sent off in his side's 2-0 defeat against Turkey on Monday.

      "body": "<p>Some 12 hours after watching his team have a nightmare, Kevin Keegan looked like a man who had woken from a dream. Gone was the fairyland view with which he began the tournament, convinced that his England squad was packed with so much quality that they could actually win Euro 2000. </p> <p>Instead Keegan looked yesterday like someone who had seen the cold light of day, forced to accept that England's players were not as good as he thought and that his famed gifts of communication had failed to make up the difference. </p> <p>\"Things we talked about on the training ground haven't quite found their way on to the pitch,\" he said. \"I have to take responsibility for that.\" </p> <p>However, his admission of failure was made in the comforting knowledge that it would not count against him. He still believes he is the man for the job, and more importantly the Football Association does not disagree. </p> <p>But Keegan needs to improve his act if he is not to be booed off the stage. One tournament failure constitutes a yellow card at this level, and one more almost certainly means red. </p> <p>The impression Keegan offered the media yesterday as he shuddered at the way his players failed to pass the ball properly all tournament was of a man who had not quite realised what he was letting himself in for when he took the coach's job amidst a tide of national relief last season. </p> <p>It was as if no one had told him that it basically entailed shaping a successful England purse from a collection of sows' ears to compete at a standard of football that has surprised even this seasoned international. \"I've played in big games at club level but this is another level again,\" he said. </p> <p>Much of the future hopes for England's improvement rest on whether Armthorpe's eternal optimist can assimilate the torturous lessons learned against the ball-lovers of Portugal and Romania and come up with an answer.

      "bodyText": "Some 12 hours after watching his team have a nightmare, Kevin Keegan looked like a man who had woken from a dream. Gone was the fairyland view with which he began the tournament, convinced that his England squad was packed with so much quality that they could actually win Euro 2000. Instead Keegan looked yesterday like someone who had seen the cold light of day, forced to accept that England's players were not as good as he thought and that his famed gifts of communication had failed to make up the difference. \"Things we talked about on the training ground haven't quite found their way on to the pitch,\" he said. \"I have to take responsibility for that.\" However, his admission of failure was made in the comforting knowledge that it would not count against him. He still believes he is the man for the job, and more importantly the Football Association does not disagree. But Keegan needs to improve his act if he is not to be booed off the stage. One tournament failure constitutes a yellow card at this level, and one more almost certainly means red. The impression Keegan offered the media yesterday as he shuddered at the way his players failed to pass the ball properly all tournament was of a man who had not quite realised what he was letting himself in for when he took the coach's job amidst a tide of national relief last season. It was as if no one had told him that it basically entailed shaping a successful England purse from a collection of sows' ears to compete at a standard of football that has surprised even this seasoned international. \"I've played in big games at club level but this is another level again,\" he said. Much of the future hopes for England's improvement rest on whether Armthorpe's eternal optimist can assimilate the torturous lessons learned against the ball-lovers of Portugal and Romania and come up with an answer. He insists he will. \"I've done my very, very best here, and I will certainly be better for the experience. I've learned a lot.\" The cry at such moments of national navel gazing is normally for a clear-out of the team to make way for youth. But with a World Cup qualifying campaign beginning in October with another collision against Germany, Keegan needs to be careful to throw out only the bathwater. Though he will be keen to bring in fresh legs, the experience offered by the likes of Martin Keown, David Seaman and even Tony Adams in defence is likely to be utilised in the short term. Turning wholesale to youth is no panacea and Keegan did not give the impression of a coach about to wield the axe. \"We've got some very good players in this squad who will retain their positions until the next World Cup,\" he said. \"I'll look at all the current squad and if they're fit and playing well for their clubs they will be in contention.\" Some experimentation will be required to blend in the younger players needed for the finals two years hence, but it offers no guarantee that the passing will improve. Keegan pointed out that his players pass the ball well in training and for their clubs. But there is no pressure attached to the former, and the latter is usually executed while orbiting the foreign stars who do most of the creative work in the Premiership. Regardless, what the country demands now is action. And on that score even the main juror is out. \"I've asked myself whether I am the right man for the future and the answer is yes,\" Keegan said. \"But until I prove that, there are always going to be question marks.\"",

      "body": "<p>Will Self may not have been too pleased with the reviews of his novel, How the Dead Live (Bloomsbury \u00a315.99), but there was one consolation: <strong>Julie Burchill</strong>, in her reliably crazed <strong>Guardian</strong> column, announced to the world that she no longer fancied him.</p> <p> \"To get the full clout of this,\" she explained, \"you've got to understand what Will Self represented, sexually, in the 90s. Despite his drug and alcohol intake, to us London media babes he was a sexual icon packing the oomph of Jimi Hendrix, Robbie Williams and Gordon Brown all rolled into one. Every man wanted to be him and every woman wanted to have him. They usually did, too.\"</p> <p> Burchill picked up on the rebranding of Self (\"no more the junkie stud, instead the funky dad\"), which was seen to best effect in <strong>Lynn Barber</strong>'s interview with him in the<strong>Observer</strong>. The Demon Barber's vitriol was kept firmly in its bottle. \"Normally, he would celebrate the delivery of a manuscript by going on a bender,\" she cooed. \"This time he took his seven-year-old daughter to buy presents in Hamleys.\"</p> <p> Self, not surprisingly, used the interview to tell us how good the book was: \"I didn't get any sense of completion until I was very near the end, when suddenly I could look back and see that it was working. But up till then I was in the dark wood.\"</p> <p> Unfortunately,<strong> Adam Mars-Jones</strong>, who reviewed the book for the same paper, found it entirely wooden. \"It may seem a perverse criticism of a book like How the Dead Live to say that it lacks vitality. But a book about fish doesn't have scales and a book about death needs a pulse as much as any other, perhaps more than most.\" (The book is narrated by a dead woman called Lily Bloom and deals, in part, with an area called Dulston, the centre of what Elaine Showalter in the Guardian called \"necropolitan\" London and home to an animated spirit community.)</p> <p> Mars-Jones, along with most critics, admired the ambition but attacked the execution. \"At the heart of the novel is a desire to tackle big themes and extreme situations, coupled with an absolute unwillingness to risk being uncool. The tone is one of unvarying contempt... a dutiful nihilism which over hundreds of pages becomes mysteriously vanilla for lack of anything to contrast with it.\"</p> <p> <strong> Tom Deverson</strong>, in the Sunday Times, was even more combative. His opening set the tone: \"It takes more than average chutzpah to write a long novel in which peregrinations around a city are interspersed with literary allusions, inner monologues, phantasmagoric episodes, mythological references, a funeral and daytime sex - and to call your main character Bloom. But then nobody would accuse Will Self of literary modesty.\"</p> <p> It got worse: \"The verbal excess is a thin would-be impressive membrane over an inner tissue of more commonplace commentary. There are incidentally interesting thoughts, such as the affinity of addicts with the dying, both of whom 'operate within tiny windows of temporal opportunity'. There are brief moments of enchanting imaginative transformation, as when Lily's duvet pattern dissolves into the grid of Manhattan. But more frequently, the look-at-me-mum metaphors and the compulsive alliteration are striking without being enlightening.\"</p> <p> <strong> Robert Hanks</strong>, in the <strong>Daily Telegraph</strong>, also thought the book showy and chaotic: \"Self's creative consciousness seems to have become a no-go area for the forces of law and order, the mental equivalent of a really rough inner-city estate... The ingenuity and moral depth detectable in parts of the book only make its overall failure more frustrating.</p> <p> \"Self's gifts as a writer are undeniable; they shriek from every page.

      "bodyText": "Will Self may not have been too pleased with the reviews of his novel, How the Dead Live (Bloomsbury \u00a315.99), but there was one consolation: Julie Burchill, in her reliably crazed Guardian column, announced to the world that she no longer fancied him. \"To get the full clout of this,\" she explained, \"you've got to understand what Will Self represented, sexually, in the 90s. Despite his drug and alcohol intake, to us London media babes he was a sexual icon packing the oomph of Jimi Hendrix, Robbie Williams and Gordon Brown all rolled into one. Every man wanted to be him and every woman wanted to have him. They usually did, too.\" Burchill picked up on the rebranding of Self (\"no more the junkie stud, instead the funky dad\"), which was seen to best effect in Lynn Barber's interview with him in theObserver. The Demon Barber's vitriol was kept firmly in its bottle. \"Normally, he would celebrate the delivery of a manuscript by going on a bender,\" she cooed. \"This time he took his seven-year-old daughter to buy presents in Hamleys.\" Self, not surprisingly, used the interview to tell us how good the book was: \"I didn't get any sense of completion until I was very near the end, when suddenly I could look back and see that it was working. But up till then I was in the dark wood.\" Unfortunately, Adam Mars-Jones, who reviewed the book for the same paper, found it entirely wooden. \"It may seem a perverse criticism of a book like How the Dead Live to say that it lacks vitality. But a book about fish doesn't have scales and a book about death needs a pulse as much as any other, perhaps more than most.\" (The book is narrated by a dead woman called Lily Bloom and deals, in part, with an area called Dulston, the centre of what Elaine Showalter in the Guardian called \"necropolitan\" London and home to an animated spirit community.) Mars-Jones, along with most critics, admired the ambition but attacked the execution. \"At the heart of the novel is a desire to tackle big themes and extreme situations, coupled with an absolute unwillingness to risk being uncool. The tone is one of unvarying contempt... a dutiful nihilism which over hundreds of pages becomes mysteriously vanilla for lack of anything to contrast with it.\" Tom Deverson, in the Sunday Times, was even more combative. His opening set the tone: \"It takes more than average chutzpah to write a long novel in which peregrinations around a city are interspersed with literary allusions, inner monologues, phantasmagoric episodes, mythological references, a funeral and daytime sex - and to call your main character Bloom. But then nobody would accuse Will Self of literary modesty.\" It got worse: \"The verbal excess is a thin would-be impressive membrane over an inner tissue of more commonplace commentary. There are incidentally interesting thoughts, such as the affinity of addicts with the dying, both of whom 'operate within tiny windows of temporal opportunity'. There are brief moments of enchanting imaginative transformation, as when Lily's duvet pattern dissolves into the grid of Manhattan. But more frequently, the look-at-me-mum metaphors and the compulsive alliteration are striking without being enlightening.\" Robert Hanks, in the Daily Telegraph, also thought the book showy and chaotic: \"Self's creative consciousness seems to have become a no-go area for the forces of law and order, the mental equivalent of a really rough inner-city estate... The ingenuity and moral depth detectable in parts of the book only make its overall failure more frustrating. \"Self's gifts as a writer are undeniable; they shriek from every page. But he is a talent entirely without discipline or discrimination. The book is packed with puns, assonances and alliterations; polysyllables, jargon and slang run amok; metaphors and similes blunder about, crashing into one another. After the first 40 pages, I was ready to give in, to say:'All right, Self, you're bloody marvellous. Now can't you just shut up and leave me alone?' But no, he keeps on going for another 360 pages.\" Katie Owen, in the Sunday Telegraph, found similar faults, but was a good deal more forgiving. \"The unruliness and extravagance of Self's writing is both his strength and his failing.

The space agency is planning missions to Mars in 2003 and 2005 which will include the use of a robot to sample the planet's surface. </p> <p>Several missions have found what look like dried-up gullies, canyons and even lakes or seas on Mars, but no evidence that any water is left. That is not surprising, as the average temperature on Mars is far below freezing at minus 63 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 53 C), although it can rise as high as 80 degrees Fahrenheit (27 C) on a blazing midday at the planet's equator. </p> <p>The thin atmosphere and roaring dust-storms that sweep the planet are also not conducive to placid lakes and trickling streams. </p> <p>And the structures that have been seen are missing the little \"feeder\" elements of an earthly river, such as the rills and small channels that feed into a stream. </p> <p>\"Whatever the explanation for the absence of these features, the possibility that liquid water flowed across the martian surface in a sizable volume for an extended period of time, and especially in the recent past, seems quite remote,\" Malin and Edgett wrote. </p> <p>They took a closer look at some of the features that had looked like seepage, found for the most part on crater walls. It would be in the partially protected craters that water would be most likely to last for any length of time before evaporating, scientists agree. </p> <p>The structures look like seepage gullies and classic landslides found on Earth, they said. Even more interesting, although much of the surface of Mars has been pocked by craters, these structures do not have craters in them, suggesting they formed quite recently. </p> <p>The scientists said they had looked for other explanations for the structures. \"However, it is unlikely that 'dry' mass movement processes (such as granular flows or avalanches fluidized by atmospheric or soil gases) can explain the observed landforms,\" they wrote. </p> <p>They said it looked to them as if water had percolated up from below the surface and perhaps a frozen barrier of ice had built up and slowed its evaporation. </p> <p>They are not sure how much water is involved, but they did an estimate on one structure that suggests there would be 250 million litres or 66 million gallons. \"For reference, if fully accessible, this would be enough water to supply 100 people for nearly 20 years (without recycling).\"</p>",

The space agency is planning missions to Mars in 2003 and 2005 which will include the use of a robot to sample the planet's surface. Several missions have found what look like dried-up gullies, canyons and even lakes or seas on Mars, but no evidence that any water is left. That is not surprising, as the average temperature on Mars is far below freezing at minus 63 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 53 C), although it can rise as high as 80 degrees Fahrenheit (27 C) on a blazing midday at the planet's equator. The thin atmosphere and roaring dust-storms that sweep the planet are also not conducive to placid lakes and trickling streams. And the structures that have been seen are missing the little \"feeder\" elements of an earthly river, such as the rills and small channels that feed into a stream. \"Whatever the explanation for the absence of these features, the possibility that liquid water flowed across the martian surface in a sizable volume for an extended period of time, and especially in the recent past, seems quite remote,\" Malin and Edgett wrote. They took a closer look at some of the features that had looked like seepage, found for the most part on crater walls. It would be in the partially protected craters that water would be most likely to last for any length of time before evaporating, scientists agree. The structures look like seepage gullies and classic landslides found on Earth, they said. Even more interesting, although much of the surface of Mars has been pocked by craters, these structures do not have craters in them, suggesting they formed quite recently. The scientists said they had looked for other explanations for the structures. \"However, it is unlikely that 'dry' mass movement processes (such as granular flows or avalanches fluidized by atmospheric or soil gases) can explain the observed landforms,\" they wrote. They said it looked to them as if water had percolated up from below the surface and perhaps a frozen barrier of ice had built up and slowed its evaporation. They are not sure how much water is involved, but they did an estimate on one structure that suggests there would be 250 million litres or 66 million gallons. \"For reference, if fully accessible, this would be enough water to supply 100 people for nearly 20 years (without recycling).\"",

      "bodyText": "A police officer was yesterday fined and could lose his job for calling a colleague - the aunt of supermodel Naomi Campbell - a \"flat-nosed monkey\". PC Peter Ferguson, 42, was fined \u00a3500 and ordered to pay \u00a3300 costs after being found guilty at Tower Bridge magistrates court, London, of using threatening or insulting words or behaviour which were racially aggravated to PC Sonia Campbell, 36. Stipendiary magistrate Shamoon Somjee was told that Ferguson pushed his nose down and made racial insults to Ms Campbell at a charity police quiz night in Kensington, west London, in November. The officers were off duty at a wine bar with more than 50 colleagues from Kensington police station when Ferguson also told her that she looked like \"she could have gone six rounds with Mike Tyson\". The court heard evidence from three other officers who witnessed the incident but made no reference to it. Only the wife of another police officer gave evidence backing Ms Campbell's complaint. Mr Somjee said the officers were \"deliberately selective\" in what they heard. After the verdict Ms Campbell, who has been a police officer since 1993, said: \"It has been a traumatic eight months waiting for this trial to come and to be dealt with. I'm pleased with the outcome and the support that I have been given by my colleagues.\" Ferguson had denied using threatening or insulting words or behaviour which were racially aggravated. He told the court his comments had been intended as \"banter\" between friendly colleagues. He now faces an internal Metropolitan police tribunal where his future will be decided. After the verdict Steve Otter, borough commander for Kensington and Chelsea, said: \"We dealt with this within a day of it happening which demonstrates our commitment to not tolerating in any way racist insults or behaviour by any of our officers.\"",

      "bodyText": "ITV has been told to move its late night news bulletin to an earlier slot by the Independent Television Commission, which has rejected the network's plans to boost audiences. The industry regulator is insisting channel bosses bring forward their 11pm nightly news programme to help revive falling audiences following last year's axing of News at Ten. Plans to boost ratings by injecting extra cash into popularising the peaktime 9pm to 11pm schedule on ITV were ruled out. Today's ITC decision comes a month after it gave ITV extra time to arrest the plunging audience figures suffered since News at Ten was dropped in spring last year. It comes on the back of fierce criticism from MPs, including prime minister Tony Blair, who want to see the long-running bulletin restored. An ITC spokesman said today's announcement meant ITV was effectively being ordered to move the Nightly News. If it refused to do so, its only recourse would be to appeal through the courts. \"If ITV choose not to come forward with a proposal for a bulletin earlier in the evening, we are in a position to direct them to move it,\" he said. \"We have statutory powers which enable us to order ITV to bring forward the news.\" He added: \"This is all about public service broadcasting. It's about scheduling for the benefit of the viewers, and at the moment people are going to bed before the Nightly News goes out at 11pm.\" Sir Robin Biggam, ITC chairman, said: \"ITV has a public service obligation to deliver national and international news to viewers. About 60% of the population still don't have access to multi-channel television, so they rely on terrestrial services to get their news and information.\" When News at Ten ended last year it was attracting nearly twice as many viewers as its successor, which currently brings in an average of three million. The spokesman said the ITC was being open-minded about how much earlier the Nightly News should be scheduled. As research showed 30% more viewers were available at 10.30pm than at 11pm, the station was not necessarily being told to bring back News at Ten. Gerald Kaufman, chair of the culture select committee, said he was \"very pleased\" with the ITC's ruling and hoped it would signal the return of News At Ten. \"It is now for ITV to take note of the very strong feeling across the country and bring back News At Ten,\" he said. ITV's original decision to scrap News at Ten was attributed, in part, to its wish to show uninterrupted films, dramas and live sports coverage at peak time. Responding to today's announcement, a statement from ITV read: \"ITV regrets the ITC's rejection of its proposals for improving the audiences for national and international news programmes. \"ITV is considering its position in the light of the ITC's statement and will respond in full in due course.\" Useful links The ITC ITC press release ITN ITV",

      "bodyText": "Police have launched a \"major investigation\" into the deaths of 18 children aged between eight weeks and 17 years. A nurse has been suspended from an Essex NHS trust. The investigation centres on suspected overdoses of painkillers given to terminally ill children over a three-year period between 1996 and May 1999, reports today's Sun newspaper. An Essex police statement said: \"We are investigating allegations made against a nurse from the former Southend community care services NHS trust - now replaced by the South Essex mental health and community care NHS trust - concerning care of patients.\" \"The police were called in by the trust following concerns raised by an unrelated internal investigation. The nurse is currently suspended by the trust. \"Police officers and clinicians from the trust have visited families involved in the investigation and given them information about it and offer any support required.\" Police denied that any bodies of children would have to be exhumed as part of the inquiry. \"I am not considering exhumations at all,\" said detective superintendent Ian Weaver at a lunchtime news conference. The nurse, who is in her 40s and has worked in several hospitals during a long career, including London's world-famous Great Ormond Street hospital, was suspended last September in an unconnected matter, the NHS trust confirmed. Police were called in and picked up the current line of inquiry. According to the Sun, the suspension was triggered after the mother of one boy wrote a letter of complaint about her to health bosses. The letter is said to have complained of \"serious misgivings\" about the professional conduct of the nurse which, the parent said, had \"jeopardised and compromised\" her son's treatment. A spokesman for the UKCC, nursing's regulatory body, said it was sending the woman a letter today telling her she faced interim suspension from the nursing register. The nurse would probably be formally suspended for the interim within the next three weeks, the spokesman said. \"We have to give people notice of interim suspension and a committee has to consider the case but we have moved to act very quickly today,\" he said. \"She will face interim suspension while the police investigation is carried out.\" The move will stop the nurse from working anywhere in the country, as well as at the hospital trust where she was employed and from which she has already been suspended. The Sun reports that Essex police have been in contact with colleagues in Manchester who investigated Harold Shipman and police in Lincolnshire who helped convict hospital nurse Beverley Allitt. Allitt was dubbed The Angel of Death after killing four young children while she worked at Grantham hospital in the early 1990s.

That's why he's been off. But the gravel erupted two weeks ago.\" </p> <p> \"Maybe, but\u0097\" </p> <p> \"Watch this work.\" </p> <p> The horse shot past them. You could see the exercise boy gritting his teeth, the horse was pulling so hard. Buddy said, \"That horse loves to run, and I'm not going to stand in his way. In fact, I'm going to provide him with an opportunity to do what he loves to do.\" </p> <p> \"Buddy\u0097\" But in the end, he couldn't bring himself to say what he was thinking, which was that the horse was going to break down. </p> <p> \"You know what?\" </p> <p> \"What?\" </p> <p> \"These horses are here to race and win. Their owners pay me seventy bucks a day and all they fucking care about is racing and winning. But that's not even it. The owners don't: care as much about racing and winning as I do. If the fucking horse falls over two steps after the finish line, he's done his job that he was born into this world to do.\" </p> <p> \"I don't think\u0097\" </p> <p> \"What? A Thoroughbred is not a natural phenomenon. His mommy and daddy didn't fall in love, get married, and decide to have a baby. None of these horses would be here if they weren't meant to race and win.

I'm smart enough to know how to get by without being smart.\" </p> <p> \"Anyone can learn\u0097\" </p> <p> \"Can they? You had that colt Rough Strife, remember him? You had him around here for a year and a half. He was dumb as a post, wasn't he? He's a legend. He fell down at the quarter pole in his first race, and every start after that, he shied at the quarter pole. He couldn't learn not to. Lots of them can, but he couldn't.\" </p> <p> \"Just get his stifles\u0097\" </p> <p> \"I don't want to know about it. He's ready to run. As long as he tells me he wants to run, I'm going to run him.\" Buddy leaned out the window and shouted, \"Gaspar, you were okay this time, so I'm going to put you on another crazy one. I think you're learning something!\" And he turned and marched out of the grandstand. In the ensuing lull, Farley realized that his own second set were discreetly milling about, awaiting instructions. He sighed. </p> <p> By Wednesday, Farley was back to normal, sleepwise, and Oliver was back to normal, flu-wise, so Farley didn't get to the grandstand until dawn was breaking over Pasadena. There were two or three trainers standing about, and Farley joined in the joking. Henry, who was over seventy but under eighty-five, said, \"You know, there were these two veterinary surgeons who shall remain nameless, but you know them, golfing up there at Pebble Beach, before the Japs bought the place. They were on the third hole, there, in the woods, and the guy from around here says to the guy from Kentucky, 'See that tree down there with that knothole about four feet from the ground?' </p> <p> \"'Yeah,' says the other one. </p> <p> \"'This is the kind of surgeon I am. There's an owl in that tree, and I'm going to take these surgical instruments I got in my golf bag, and I'm going to remove that owl's tonsils without waking him up.' </p> <p> \"'Nah,' says the other surgeon. </p> <p> \"But the guy goes down there, leans into the knothole, and comes back ten minutes later. He's got these two tiny little pink things in his hand, and sure enough, they look like tonsils. </p> <p> \"So they each take another shot, and the surgeon from Kentucky says, 'Gimme those instruments. I'm such a good surgeon that I'm gonna go down there and remove that owl's balls without him waking up.' So he heads down to the tree, leans in, comes back ten minutes later. He's got two tiny red things in his hand, and he says, 'Sleeping like a baby.' So the California guy says, 'You win,' and they finish their round. </p> <p> \"Well, around dusk the owl wakes up, and he goes out flying around for a while, and he comes over to a friend's tree, and lands, and they're sitting there talking, and he says, 'You know, there's something funny going on over there on the third hole. Stay away from there is my advice. I woke up tonight, and I can't hoot worth a fuck or fuck worth a hoot.'\" </p> <p> Everyone laughed and, after a while, headed back to the barns, except Farley and Henry. Henry looked up at Farley. He said, \"So\u0097Buddy Crawford says you broke that horse of his down.\" </p> <p> \"I did hear that colt of his broke down Saturday, but all I did was\u0097\" </p> <p> \"Shouldn'ta done even that.\" </p> <p> \"Even what?\" </p> <p> \"Even make a suggestion, or a comment, or whatever.\" </p> <p> \"The horse was moving just like a filly I had. I knew for sure\u0097\" </p> <p> \"Shoulda kept your mouth shut. Buddy says you jinxed it for him.\" </p> <p> \"Henry, that's ridi\u0097\" </p> <p> \"You may think so, Farley, and I may think so. I may. I'm not saying I do. But this is a racetrack, Farley. Jinxes, curses, luck, superstitions, evil eyes\u0097this is where they live.\" </p> <p> \"Breakdowns have causes, like stress fractures and toegrabs and bad conditioning.\" </p> <p> \"They do. But you tangled yourself in this one.\" </p> <p> \"I was right, is all.\" </p> <p> \"That's an even worse mistake, to be right about another man's horse.\" Henry shook his head, then he said, \"I know something's up with you, boy. You haven't had such a good year this year. Those come and go.\" </p> <p> \"I know that. That's not\u0097\" </p> <p> \"Listen to me, I'll tell you something. I've worked all over California, here and up north and at the fairs. You know I saw Phar Lap? Down at Agua Caliente. Right there is what I'm getting at. The things I've seen men do to horses made me believe in sin, original and every other kind. And when I die, and that isn't so far away now, I expect to be punished for the sins I looked upon but didn't stop. But what I'm telling you is, that's the wages of a life at the track. You don't say everything you know.\" </p> <p> Farley knew that this was true. Henry shook his head, then turned and walked away. </p> <p> Chapter Three </p> <p> IF WISHES WERE HORSES </p> <p> The reason Tiffany Morse left her purse on the bench in front of the clothes dryer in the Spankee Yankee Laundromat in Lowell, Massachusetts, was that she had to run out the door into the dank November cold to catch her niece Iona, and in the panic of that, she forgot where her purse was. Then she had to make Iona look at her and understand that she was not to ever ever ever go outside without Tiffany ever again, but of course, Iona was too young to understand that\u0097she was only three. Fast, though. Anyway, when she came back to dryer number four (\"John Adams\"\u0097all the dryers were named after famous Massachusetts politicians, right down to \"Michael Dukakis,\" number sixteen), her purse was open and her money was gone. The Laundromat was empty, too. The worst thing was that she hadn't fed any quarters into the dryer yet, and her wet clothes were sitting inside in a lump with the door open. It actually would have been easier if the thief had stolen the clothes as well as the money, since now she had to cart all those wet things back to her apartment and try to corral Iona, too, but he hadn't. Tiffany could not say that she was having a good day. She certainly could not say that. </p> <p> But Tiffany didn't really require good days anymore. She was always willing to settle for a good morning, or even a good hour. And she and Iona had had a good hour just that evening, before coming out to the Laundromat. What happened was, Tiffany picked Iona up at her mother's on her way home from work because she had agreed to take Iona for the night while her mother went to choir practice and then out with some of the other choir members, and her mother had been making pork stew, and when she got there, tired and hungry, her mother had been in a good mood, and had sat her down at the table and given her a big plateful. Iona had been a good girl, so there had been no ill-tempered references to Iona's father, Tiffany's brother, Roland, who was up to no good in Ohio somewhere, or maybe Texas. The stew had lots of potatoes and carrots in it, and nice chunks of pork. In the larger war that was Tiffany's relationship with her mother, they had made a truce. The next thing that happened was that, when Tiffany got home, she saw that the Christmas cactus in her window was starting to bloom. Between them, the stew and the flowers made her feel good enough to endure the Spankee Yankee, but now, in retrospect, she saw that they had been bad, or at least false omens, because if she hadn't had that good hour she would have stayed home watching TV, and would not have lost her money and had to hang all her wet clothes around the apartment. By the time she did that, and got Iona to bed on the couch (never an easy task), she was exhausted and even more blue than she'd been when she first discovered the money missing. </p> <p> It was more than the money, it was what the theft meant\u0097that you couldn't afford to be happy, because being happy made you do things that then ended in greater unhappiness than you had been feeling before you got happy. Everyone knew that that's the way it was with love and sex and men\u0097the happier you were when you fell in love, the more crushed you would be when it didn't work out\u0097but what was even more depressing was that that was the way it was with simple things like pork stew and flowers. The whole depressing idea made your life pretty impossible, especially since all the time you were telling your mom that (1) things were fine and (2) everything was going to be all right. Tiffany had always told herself and her mother that she wasn't going to end up where her mother had\u0097always saying things like \"Don't count on that,\" and \"There's many a slip 'tween the cup and the lip\" (an assertion that everyday experience showed to be patently untrue) and \"If wishes were horses,\" a phrase of her mother's that made no sense at all. </p> <p> Another thing her mom always said was \"Good-looking ain't necessarily good-acting.\" She usually said this in reference to guys Tiffany had turned up here and there, and in reference to Iona's father and Tiffany's brother, Roland. But often Tiffany expected that she was saying it in reference to her, because everyone said, and Tiffany herself knew, that she was a knockout, a fox, a babe, you name it. She was so used to being a drop-dead gorgeous black woman no matter what she wore or how she did her makeup that she didn't even care anymore. Where had it gotten her, now that she was twenty-one with very little to show for it? Iona was drop-dead gorgeous, too, the way tiny things are especially gorgeous because you can't believe they are so small and perfect, but Tiffany never complimented her. Drop-dead gorgeous was just a thing, like sleet or snow or flowers, that happened. And you had to be drop-dead gorgeous to know what a trivial thing it was. Tiffany often wondered what she would exchange her looks for, if she could. Something more interesting to do than working as a checker at Wal-Mart would be one thing, but the fact was, she couldn't think of what that interesting thing to do would be. That was her problem, she thought. She knew perfectly well what others wanted her to do and what she didn't want to do, but when she tried to pull up from her depths something she herself wanted to do, the bucket came up empty. Once in a while she did some research. There were programs on TV that showed you what other people did. They worked in offices or police stations or bars. Lots of them worked in show business. But none of them really did anything except sit around and make jokes, which was what Tiffany herself did all day at Wal-Mart, and so all of them looked as idle as she felt herself to be. Or she bought a magazine, but all the women's magazines made it seem as though everyone was either working full-time on her appearance, which Tiffany could afford to disdain, or else making different recipes all day, which seemed nearly as boring. There was a channel on the TV called the Discovery Channel, which Tiffany sometimes monitored, but those shows didn't focus on what the people did, only on the results of what they did. She didn't ever see how they had made the move from, say, Lowell, Massachusetts, to the plains of the Serengeti. If those people were calling out to her, then they were calling across an abyss of space that she didn't see how anyone could cross. Especially now that she had no money at all, not even bus fare to get to work tomorrow. She turned off the TV and went into the living room to check on Iona. Here Iona was, already three, already having her own ideas about stuff she wanted to do that weren't the same as your ideas about stuff Iona was supposed to do. That sort of thing made you think about how fast time went. But, then, here she was, here her mother was, doing the same things year after year, having the same arguments, not getting anywhere. That sort of thing made you think just the opposite, that time went all too slowly. She covered Iona and picked up the girl's shoes, which she set on the corner of the table so she could find them easily in the morning. </p> <p> After she had gotten into bed and turned out the light, she thought that all she had was the same prayer she had uttered before. She lay on her back and looked at the ceiling. She whispered, \"Please make something happen here.\" Tiffany sighed. This was a prayer that always worked. Unfortunately, it didn't always work as she hoped. For example, she had prayed for a job, and gotten hired at Wal-Mart. She had prayed for a boyfriend, and attracted the deathless interest of Lindsay Wicks, her dampest, palest co-worker. She had prayed for a couch, and her mother had decided to buy a new one, passing the seventeen-year-old brown thing on to Tiffany, who was required to appear grateful. She continued, \"This time, I mean it.\"</p>",

He's got two tiny red things in his hand, and he says, 'Sleeping like a baby.' So the California guy says, 'You win,' and they finish their round. \"Well, around dusk the owl wakes up, and he goes out flying around for a while, and he comes over to a friend's tree, and lands, and they're sitting there talking, and he says, 'You know, there's something funny going on over there on the third hole. Stay away from there is my advice. I woke up tonight, and I can't hoot worth a fuck or fuck worth a hoot.'\" Everyone laughed and, after a while, headed back to the barns, except Farley and Henry. Henry looked up at Farley. He said, \"So\u0097Buddy Crawford says you broke that horse of his down.\" \"I did hear that colt of his broke down Saturday, but all I did was\u0097\" \"Shouldn'ta done even that.\" \"Even what?\" \"Even make a suggestion, or a comment, or whatever.\" \"The horse was moving just like a filly I had. I knew for sure\u0097\" \"Shoulda kept your mouth shut. Buddy says you jinxed it for him.\" \"Henry, that's ridi\u0097\" \"You may think so, Farley, and I may think so. I may. I'm not saying I do. But this is a racetrack, Farley. Jinxes, curses, luck, superstitions, evil eyes\u0097this is where they live.\" \"Breakdowns have causes, like stress fractures and toegrabs and bad conditioning.\" \"They do. But you tangled yourself in this one.\" \"I was right, is all.\" \"That's an even worse mistake, to be right about another man's horse.\" Henry shook his head, then he said, \"I know something's up with you, boy. You haven't had such a good year this year. Those come and go.\" \"I know that. That's not\u0097\" \"Listen to me, I'll tell you something. I've worked all over California, here and up north and at the fairs. You know I saw Phar Lap? Down at Agua Caliente. Right there is what I'm getting at. The things I've seen men do to horses made me believe in sin, original and every other kind. And when I die, and that isn't so far away now, I expect to be punished for the sins I looked upon but didn't stop. But what I'm telling you is, that's the wages of a life at the track. You don't say everything you know.\" Farley knew that this was true. Henry shook his head, then turned and walked away. Chapter Three IF WISHES WERE HORSES The reason Tiffany Morse left her purse on the bench in front of the clothes dryer in the Spankee Yankee Laundromat in Lowell, Massachusetts, was that she had to run out the door into the dank November cold to catch her niece Iona, and in the panic of that, she forgot where her purse was. Then she had to make Iona look at her and understand that she was not to ever ever ever go outside without Tiffany ever again, but of course, Iona was too young to understand that\u0097she was only three. Fast, though. Anyway, when she came back to dryer number four (\"John Adams\"\u0097all the dryers were named after famous Massachusetts politicians, right down to \"Michael Dukakis,\" number sixteen), her purse was open and her money was gone. The Laundromat was empty, too. The worst thing was that she hadn't fed any quarters into the dryer yet, and her wet clothes were sitting inside in a lump with the door open. It actually would have been easier if the thief had stolen the clothes as well as the money, since now she had to cart all those wet things back to her apartment and try to corral Iona, too, but he hadn't. Tiffany could not say that she was having a good day. She certainly could not say that. But Tiffany didn't really require good days anymore. She was always willing to settle for a good morning, or even a good hour. And she and Iona had had a good hour just that evening, before coming out to the Laundromat. What happened was, Tiffany picked Iona up at her mother's on her way home from work because she had agreed to take Iona for the night while her mother went to choir practice and then out with some of the other choir members, and her mother had been making pork stew, and when she got there, tired and hungry, her mother had been in a good mood, and had sat her down at the table and given her a big plateful. Iona had been a good girl, so there had been no ill-tempered references to Iona's father, Tiffany's brother, Roland, who was up to no good in Ohio somewhere, or maybe Texas. The stew had lots of potatoes and carrots in it, and nice chunks of pork. In the larger war that was Tiffany's relationship with her mother, they had made a truce. The next thing that happened was that, when Tiffany got home, she saw that the Christmas cactus in her window was starting to bloom. Between them, the stew and the flowers made her feel good enough to endure the Spankee Yankee, but now, in retrospect, she saw that they had been bad, or at least false omens, because if she hadn't had that good hour she would have stayed home watching TV, and would not have lost her money and had to hang all her wet clothes around the apartment. By the time she did that, and got Iona to bed on the couch (never an easy task), she was exhausted and even more blue than she'd been when she first discovered the money missing. It was more than the money, it was what the theft meant\u0097that you couldn't afford to be happy, because being happy made you do things that then ended in greater unhappiness than you had been feeling before you got happy. Everyone knew that that's the way it was with love and sex and men\u0097the happier you were when you fell in love, the more crushed you would be when it didn't work out\u0097but what was even more depressing was that that was the way it was with simple things like pork stew and flowers. The whole depressing idea made your life pretty impossible, especially since all the time you were telling your mom that (1) things were fine and (2) everything was going to be all right. Tiffany had always told herself and her mother that she wasn't going to end up where her mother had\u0097always saying things like \"Don't count on that,\" and \"There's many a slip 'tween the cup and the lip\" (an assertion that everyday experience showed to be patently untrue) and \"If wishes were horses,\" a phrase of her mother's that made no sense at all. Another thing her mom always said was \"Good-looking ain't necessarily good-acting.\" She usually said this in reference to guys Tiffany had turned up here and there, and in reference to Iona's father and Tiffany's brother, Roland. But often Tiffany expected that she was saying it in reference to her, because everyone said, and Tiffany herself knew, that she was a knockout, a fox, a babe, you name it. She was so used to being a drop-dead gorgeous black woman no matter what she wore or how she did her makeup that she didn't even care anymore. Where had it gotten her, now that she was twenty-one with very little to show for it? Iona was drop-dead gorgeous, too, the way tiny things are especially gorgeous because you can't believe they are so small and perfect, but Tiffany never complimented her. Drop-dead gorgeous was just a thing, like sleet or snow or flowers, that happened. And you had to be drop-dead gorgeous to know what a trivial thing it was. Tiffany often wondered what she would exchange her looks for, if she could. Something more interesting to do than working as a checker at Wal-Mart would be one thing, but the fact was, she couldn't think of what that interesting thing to do would be. That was her problem, she thought. She knew perfectly well what others wanted her to do and what she didn't want to do, but when she tried to pull up from her depths something she herself wanted to do, the bucket came up empty. Once in a while she did some research. There were programs on TV that showed you what other people did. They worked in offices or police stations or bars. Lots of them worked in show business. But none of them really did anything except sit around and make jokes, which was what Tiffany herself did all day at Wal-Mart, and so all of them looked as idle as she felt herself to be. Or she bought a magazine, but all the women's magazines made it seem as though everyone was either working full-time on her appearance, which Tiffany could afford to disdain, or else making different recipes all day, which seemed nearly as boring. There was a channel on the TV called the Discovery Channel, which Tiffany sometimes monitored, but those shows didn't focus on what the people did, only on the results of what they did. She didn't ever see how they had made the move from, say, Lowell, Massachusetts, to the plains of the Serengeti. If those people were calling out to her, then they were calling across an abyss of space that she didn't see how anyone could cross. Especially now that she had no money at all, not even bus fare to get to work tomorrow. She turned off the TV and went into the living room to check on Iona. Here Iona was, already three, already having her own ideas about stuff she wanted to do that weren't the same as your ideas about stuff Iona was supposed to do. That sort of thing made you think about how fast time went. But, then, here she was, here her mother was, doing the same things year after year, having the same arguments, not getting anywhere. That sort of thing made you think just the opposite, that time went all too slowly. She covered Iona and picked up the girl's shoes, which she set on the corner of the table so she could find them easily in the morning. After she had gotten into bed and turned out the light, she thought that all she had was the same prayer she had uttered before. She lay on her back and looked at the ceiling. She whispered, \"Please make something happen here.\" Tiffany sighed. This was a prayer that always worked. Unfortunately, it didn't always work as she hoped. For example, she had prayed for a job, and gotten hired at Wal-Mart. She had prayed for a boyfriend, and attracted the deathless interest of Lindsay Wicks, her dampest, palest co-worker. She had prayed for a couch, and her mother had decided to buy a new one, passing the seventeen-year-old brown thing on to Tiffany, who was required to appear grateful. She continued, \"This time, I mean it.\"",

If they attack you, you hit them back with an axe.\"</p> <p>Mr Mugabe predicted that his party would trounce the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), the opposition group that has emerged as the most credible threat to Zanu-PF in 20 years. The president has sought to tar the MDC by accusing it of receiving financial support from Britain, the former colonial power in Zimbabwe.</p> <p>\"The MDC has won abroad, especially in Britain. That is where they are conducting their election. Here, this is Zanu-PF land,\" Mr Mugabe said. \"We rule the roost here. These British puppets are not going to win here.\"</p> <p>But the MDC appears likely to win at least 30, and perhaps 60, of the 120 elected seats in parliament. Some optimists believe that, even if the 30 Mugabe-appointed MPs are included, the opposition may win the 76 seats required for an overall majority.</p> <p><b>Useful link</b></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/zimbabwe/0,2759,181131,00.html\">Zimbabwe: special report</a></p>",

Zimbabwe has authorised 300 monitors from the Commonwealth, European Union, Organisation for African Unity and the Southern Africa Development Community to observe. The US yesterday joined others in criticising the Mugabe government, saying it had failed to create a climate conducive to credible elections. The US said Harare had extended a ban to staff from the American and other embassies, and this would detract from the credibility of the polls. Philip Reeker, a state department spokesman, said in Washington: \"We strongly disagree with such actions to limit observation efforts, and we really...deplore the government of Zimbabwe's failure to create a climate conducive to credible elections.\" The head of the 150-strong EU electoral observer group yesterday said the election campaign was the most violent he had seen. \"We have never encountered so many problems with accreditation anywhere in the world,\" Pierre Schori said during a tour of Zimbabwe's second city, Bulawayo. \"And we have never seen such violence. Intimidation and violence have no place in a democratic environment and must be condemned.\" Violence has been rampant in the runup to Saturday and Sunday's vote with more than 13,000 rural people fleeing to the relative safety of the cities, according to the Human Rights Forum. But true to form, Mr Mugabe, who has led Zimbabwe for the past 20 years, was contemptuous of criticism. He told an enthusiastic rally of 40,000 supporters in a Zanu-PF stronghold yesterday: \"We want this election to be peaceful, (but) I am not saying that if the opposition provokes you, you must fold your arms. If they attack you, you hit them back with an axe.\" Mr Mugabe predicted that his party would trounce the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), the opposition group that has emerged as the most credible threat to Zanu-PF in 20 years. The president has sought to tar the MDC by accusing it of receiving financial support from Britain, the former colonial power in Zimbabwe. \"The MDC has won abroad, especially in Britain. That is where they are conducting their election. Here, this is Zanu-PF land,\" Mr Mugabe said. \"We rule the roost here. These British puppets are not going to win here.\" But the MDC appears likely to win at least 30, and perhaps 60, of the 120 elected seats in parliament. Some optimists believe that, even if the 30 Mugabe-appointed MPs are included, the opposition may win the 76 seats required for an overall majority. Useful link Zimbabwe: special report",

      "bodyText": "Although he could not see right inside, the customs officer knew something was terribly wrong the moment he opened the heavy swing doors. The container on the white Mercedes lorry was a refrigeration unit, yet the air that belched out was warm and smelled putrid. In the half-light he saw two Chinese men sprawled in front of him, gasping for breath. Behind them the officer saw what a colleague described as a scene \"out of a nightmare\". Fifty-eight bodies lay on the metal floor in between crates of tomatoes. Police suspect that the 54 men and four women found dead during the routine inspection at Dover last Sunday were illegal entrants from the Fujian province of China, who paid a criminal gang thousands of dollars for the chance to start a new life in Britain. A driver called Perry Whacker, probably a false name, had picked up the load of tomatoes in Rotterdam in the Netherlands. The company name on the lorry was Van Der Spek Transportation. Its address is a nondescript flat in the suburbs of Rotterdam. Dutch police spent much of Monday questioning the company's owner, Arie Van Der Spek. As the police started their cross-border inquiry and continued to question the lorry driver, the British Home Secretary, Jack Straw, led a chorus condemning the trafficking that had caused \"a most terrible human tragedy\". Those who perished \"must have died a terrible death\", he said during a statement to the Commons. \"Let no one be in any doubt that this is a profoundly evil trade whose perpetrators have no regard for human life.\" Tony Blair, who is at a European Union summit in Portugal, called it a \"dreadful incident\". As detectives moved the two men who survived from hospital to a police station ready for questioning, there were urgent calls for a reassessment of the Goverment's policy towards illegal entrants. According to recent figures, the Chinese are the second-largest group - after Sri Lankans - applying to stay in the UK. Many of them arrive without documents, and China refuses to take them back. Last year's Immigration and Asylum Act, which introduced a $3,000 fine for drivers for each illegal entrant found in their vehicle, led to a 26% fall in the number of people being caught at the docks. However, Nick Hardwick, chief executive of the Refugee Council, said: \"It is virtually impossible for people fleeing persecution to enter Britain legally, and they are therefore forced to resort to such desperate measures in their search for sanctuary.\" Customs sources said that they thought the lorry had stayed near the dock all day in temperatures of up to 32C, and that its refrigeration unit was turned off. Some reports described how the Chinese, who were locked in from the outside, were already suffering in the extreme heat at Zeebrugge, in Belgium, and had tried to raise the alarm by banging on the doors and walls, screaming for help. It would have been difficult for anyone to hear their cries; the container is like a giant, airtight fridge. The gangs who organise Chinese illegal migration are believed to have targeted western Europe in greater numbers after a recent clampdown in Canada and the United States. The 58 who died on their way to Dover may have been assured that Britain was a safer destination. Experts in illegal emigration from China said on Monday that it was much harder to control the land and air routes to Europe than those across the oceans to north America. The smugglers have been known as snakeheads for many years: their clients are described as \"human snakes\". The International Organisation for Migration estimates that in 1996 global immigration racketeering was already worth as much as the drugs trade, with annual profits of $7bn. There is little doubt that it has grown larger since then.",

It is also playing a leading role in reforestation of Scottish landscapes blighted by generations of tree-felling and <a href=\"http://www.nts.org.uk/country.html\" target=\"_new\">overgrazing by sheep and deer</a>. One of the most exciting projects, run by the <a href=\"http://www.scotweb.co.uk/environment/wildwood/\" target=\"_new\">Borders Forest Trust</a>, is to recreate an ancient forest in the breathtaking <a href=\"http://www.scotweb.co.uk/environment/wildwood/tour/aerial.htm\" target=\"_new\">Carrifran Valley</a>, in the southern Uplands.</p> <p>6.

      "bodyText": "1. At 4,406ft, Ben Nevis must be Britain's biggest real estate bargain. It has been sold to the John Muir Trust for \u00a3450,000. That is just over 100 quid per foot. 2. The owner, Duncan Fairfax-Lucy, sold at less than the going rate for mountains, because he wanted to secure the future of the region. The trust is now appealing for funds to pay for the management and protection of Ben Nevis. 3. The trust is named after a Victorian pioneer of wilderness conservation who emigrated to the USA from Scotland as a boy. It has a clutch of remote and wildly beautiful properties in the Highlands and Scottish islands. 4. Unlike the lairds and absentee landlords who still own much of the land, the trust aims to restore and conserve the wilderness, while making it accessible to the public. 5. It is also playing a leading role in reforestation of Scottish landscapes blighted by generations of tree-felling and overgrazing by sheep and deer. One of the most exciting projects, run by the Borders Forest Trust, is to recreate an ancient forest in the breathtaking Carrifran Valley, in the southern Uplands. 6. Many other associations, trusts and voluntary bodies are working to conserve the ancient glories of the Scottish landscape. Among them are the National Trust for Scotland and Scottish Natural Heritage. 7. A quarter of a millennium on, hopes are even stirring that the Highland clearances, an early exercise in ethnic cleansing which saw the clans of Scotland's Highlands disbanded after the Jacobite rebellion of 1745-46, may at last be reversed, with the restoration of the land to those who live there. 8. Recent years have seen a new community spirit of resistance to the absentee landlords and would-be exploiters of the land. The Isle of Eigg has been bought by the people who live on it, and the even tinier community of Knoydart has taken back control of much of the peninsula. 9. The Knoydart Foundation has ambitious plans for sustainable development, and hopes to build a modest number of homes for newcomers. 10. After years of malign neglect, the Scottish wilderness regions are likely to depend for many years on the decidedly mixed blessing of tourism.",

The original Steven Spielberg adventure took more than \u00a3300m following its release in 1993 and its sequel, The Lost World, scooped another \u00a3400m in 1997. Now the master film-maker is taking a step back into the shadows in order to allow another director to take charge of the third movie - and the last - in the series. To date, only Sam Neill is on board to re-visit the infamous park where DNA-created beasts roamed out of control. Jeff Goldblum, who played his offbeat sidekick, is believed to be interested in joining him but there are no signs of Laura Dern who played Goldblum's romantic interest or Julianne Moore from The Lost World. Director Joe Johnston who made Jumanji with Robin Williams is putting JP3 together for Universal Studios with a reported budget of \u00a360m. Richard Attenborough, who played the scientist responsible for creating the dinosaur 'playground' in Jurassic Park is also being approached to appear in a cameo role. A production insider said: \"Steven Spielberg would never have made the sequel unless he felt there was a very good reason. \"There is certainly room for a third movie.

In a discussion paper published yesterday on its website, Ofsted said the teaching of writing was \"unsatisfactory\" in a quarter of all such lessons, with guided writing supervised by teachers taking place in only half the literacy hours seen by inspectors.

The results also reinforce the gender gap, with only 47% of boys achieving level 4 in writing in 1999, compared with 62% of girls. The study's conclusions of \"unsatisfactory\" teaching in a quarter of all lessons was borne out by an inspection of 300 literacy hours, where there was no shared writing.

      "body": "<p>There's something faintly disturbing about cereal packets, something you may not have noticed. It's that reassurance at the bottom of the blurb promoting special offers: \"Your statutory rights are not affected.\" Rights? What rights? Ignorance can be costly. In this consumer age, which has just invented a pill to treat shopaholics, most of us are likely to make a dud purchase at some point, whether from a shop, by mail order or by a salesperson on the doorstep. Without knowing our legal rights, we may not even realise we've been had. </p> <p><strong> Statutory rights</strong><br> </p> <p> These are the laws that help customers to complain about substandard goods. They stipulate, for instance, that a purchase must be of satisfactory quality, taking into account price and how they were described in the shop. If goods are scratched, warped or break down after a short period, you are entitled to a refund, provided the salesman didn't point out the fault before you paid. Even if the condition is fine, you can still demand a refund if the item is not fit for its purpose. Say, for instance, you had requested a printer cartridge to fit a specified printer and the shopkeeper sold you the wrong size, he would be obliged to take it back. However, you would have no such prerog ative if a dress you chose is the wrong size or simply decided you don't like it. Stores which refund in such cases are motivated by goodwill, not legal necessity. Third, goods must be as described correctly, so if the display sign or the salesperson tells you a jumper is 100% wool, you can make a fuss if it contains polyester. </p> <p><strong> Getting redress</strong><br> </p> <p> Speed is of the essence. It's no good sitting on a new toaster for a year then taking it out of its box and discovering that it doesn't work. The law gives you \"reasonable time\" to examine a purchase and to complain if you find a problem. It doesn't define how much time is reasonable - just make sure that you try purchases out as soon as possible and make the complaint immediately. You don't need a receipt, although it makes things easier to have one. Don't let the shop- keeper fob you off with a replacement, repair or credit note if you don't want one. You are entitled to your money back and shops which claim a policy of no-refunds are committing a criminal offence. Nor should you listen if the vendor blames the manufacturer; under law it's the vendor's responsibility. If, however, you let a certain amount of time slip by, you lose your right to a refund and will probably have to agree to a repair or replacement. </p> <p>Where possible, pay by credit card, especially for mail order: under the Consumer Credit Act the credit card company is jointly liable if things go wrong and may be obliged to refund the money if the goods or service cost more than \u00a3100. This also applies to hire purchase. </p> <p><strong> Guarantees</strong><br> </p> <p> Many manufacturers offer these and they are useful after \"reasonable time\" has elapsed and statutory rights no longer apply. Beware extended guarantees or warranties, however. These promises of \"peace of mind\" are dangled when you buy electrical goods. However, the word \"warranty\" is not recognised in law; each contract depends on the conditions drawn up by the seller and while ostensibly for the benefit of the customer, the clauses often favour the dealer who may earn big commissions on policies. Check exclu sions and claim limits before signing and if these are not on the explanatory leaflet, ask to see a list. A car warranty, for example, might specify that mechanical parts are covered but not electrical ones, but it could be that a mechanical part fails because of an electrical problem. Even if the insurer pays up, your policy premiums are likely to have cost up to four times the amount you would have paid for a one-off repair. </p> <p><strong> Mail order</strong><br> </p> <p> Your statutory rights apply here as they would in a shop, plus you have the right to cancel your order if it fails to show after 28 days or within the timescale specified. Most newspapers and magazines have mail order protection schemes which refund money paid for goods advertised on their pages if the supplier goes out of business. If a firm sends goods that you didn't order you don't have to accept or pay for them. They become yours after 30 days if you write to the company rejecting them and the company fails to collect them. If you don't write you can claim them after six months. Any company which hassles you for money is likely to be breaking the law and should be reported to your local Trading Standards authority. </p> <p><strong> Doorstep selling</strong><br> </p> <p> If you sign up to a deal costing more than \u00a335 you are entitled to a seven- day cooling-off period in which to change your mind, provided that the seller called uninvited and the contract was signed in your home (it's extended to 14 days if the salesman is a member of the Direct Selling Association). It's too bad, though, if you invited the dealer to call, and that includes responding to an advertise ment. In that case you have no automatic right to cancel. If, on the other hand, you agree to a visit after being cold-called, you are entitled to those seven days. There's an additional escape route if you pay more than \u00a350 on credit - you may back down within five days provided you discussed the deal face-to-face with the seller and weren't on his business premises at the time. </p> <p><strong> When all else fails</strong><br> </p> <p> Should a seller not respond when you complain in person and in writing, get in touch with the relevant trade association if the dealer is a member. Many offer cheap arbitration services. Or write to the trading standards authority, under the umbrella of your county or district council. The small claims court is a last resort, although this option is barred if you've tried arbitration. In England and Wales a claim has to be \u00a35,000 or less to qualify for a county court hearing. In Scotland, claims of up to \u00a3750 are heard in the sheriff court. </p> <p>In the English system, you don't need a solicitor and if the other side chooses to employ one you won't be liable for the cost if you lose, unless you fail to attend hearings or bring a case that stands little chance of winning. Obtain a form from the court office (look under \"courts\" in the telephone directory) and fill out the details. If your claim is \u00a3200 or less you pay a \u00a327 court fee (your opponent pays if you win), rising to \u00a360 for claims of \u00a3400-\u00a3500, \u00a380 for claims up to \u00a31,000 and \u00a3115 thereafter. The downside is that if you win and your opponent declares himself bankrupt or vanishes you may not see the money.

      "body": "<p><strong>What was Hansie Cronje's record as captain in one-day internationals?</strong> asks Vineet Sarat </p> <p> In a word, excellent - despite what we now know. Cronje captained South Africa in 138 one-dayers between 1993-94 and 1999-2000. He won 99 of them (71.7%), lost 35, and tied one (that unforgettable World Cup semi-final last year), with three no-results. He made 4070 runs as captain at an average of 37.68 with no hundreds but 31 half-centuries, including 79 in what looks likely to have been his last international innings, against Pakistan in Sharjah in April.</p> <p> <strong>I'm thinking of celebrating my 40th birthday in style next January by going to the West Indies. Do you know who will be touring the Caribbean early next year?</strong> asks Dick Wearmouth</p> <p> South Africa will be touring the West Indies early next year for what should be an exciting five-Test series - South Africa won all five Tests of their home series in 1998-99, so West Indies will be looking for revenge in the first series between the sides in the Caribbean (where they have met only in the one-off Test of 1991-92). There will also be several one-day internationals. January may be a little early though - the exact dates have not been announced, but the tour is expected to last from February to April.</p> <p> <strong> In the recent three-day match between Glamorgan and the West Indian tourists, there were an inordinate amount of lbws. Has there been an international where all ten wickets have been given out leg-before?</strong> asks Paul Canham</p> <p> There were 17 lbws in all in that match at Cardiff, and that's the Test record too. It was set in the match between West Indies and Pakistan at Port-of-Spain in 1992-93. The overworked umpires were Steve Bucknor, who raised the fatal finger 12 times, and Dickie Bird (five). The record for a Test innings is six lbws, which has happened 11 times. In one-day internationals the record is five lbws in an innings (five instances) and eight in a match (two).</p> <p> <strong>To settle a bet, what was the nickname of Allan Border?</strong> asks Gavin Chesher</p> <p> In the later stages of his career Border was known simply as \"AB\". Earlier he was known for a while as \"Captain Grumpy\" - but that name became less and less appropriate as Australia started winning regularly. And before he became captain he was briefly known as \"Pugsley\", because of a supposed resemblance to one of the characters in the Addams Family!</p> <p> <strong> Where was Fred Trueman born?</strong> asks Ken Main</p> <p> Frederick Sewards Trueman was born in Scotch Springs, Stainton, near Maltby in Yorkshire, on February 6, 1931. He made his debut for Yorkshire in 1949, and played his first Test in 1952. In 1964 he became the first bowler to take 300 wickets in Tests, and he finished up with 307. For The Observer's interview with him about his new-ball partner Brian Statham, who died this month, <a href=\"http://www.cricketunlimited.co.uk/Articles/0,5217,333503,00.html\">click here</a>.</p> <p> <strong> Sixteen years ago I used to play for Hoddesdon Cricket Club in Hertfordshire, and would like to catch up with them again. Do you know how I could contact the club?</strong> asks M Hick</p> <p> Hoddesdon CC do seem to be still going strong. According to the Club Cricket Conference, their secretary is Mr DG Sutherland, 8 Burnside, Hoddesdon, Herts EN11 8PG.</p> <p> <strong>Have England confirmed where they will be touring this winter (2000-01)?</strong> asks Pete Whittaker</p> <p> England will start with their first tour of Pakistan since 1987-88, and will be making a nervous return to the Iqbal Stadium in Faisalabad, scene of the incident between Mike Gatting and umpire Shakoor Rana which disfigured that tour. There will be three one-day internationals - at Karachi (Oct 24), Lahore (Oct 27) and Rawalpindi (Oct 29) - followed by three Tests, at Lahore (Nov 15-19), Faisalabad (Nov 29-Dec 3), and Karachi (Dec 7-11). After a break for Christmas, England undertake a similar programme in Sri Lanka. The Tests will be at Galle (Feb 22-26), Kandy (March 7-11) and Colombo (March 15-19), and the ODIs will all be in Colombo (March 23, 25 and 27).</p> <p> <strong>Who was the England player who broke his kneecap on tour in the early 1990s?</strong> asks Peter Drake</p> <p> The unfortunate man was David \"Syd\" Lawrence, the big-hearted Gloucestershire fast bowler. He had just started his third over in the closing stages of the drawn third Test against New Zealand at Wellington in February 1992 when he fell to the ground in agony. Other players spoke of hearing a noise like a gunshot as his kneecap broke in half. Lawrence, who was 28 at the time, never played for England again (this was his fifth cap), although he did make a brave but short-lived comeback for Gloucestershire.</p> <p> <strong>I've got stuck on a crossword question: The New Ball (Cricket) - six letters (starts with C, fifth letter R). Can you help?</strong> asks Tony French</p> <p> I think the word you're looking for is \"cherry\" - that's what some of our more poetic commentators and even players call the ball when it's a bright shiny red.</p> <p><em>Steven Lynch is managing editor of Wisden Cricket Monthly.

Cronje captained South Africa in 138 one-dayers between 1993-94 and 1999-2000. He won 99 of them (71.7%), lost 35, and tied one (that unforgettable World Cup semi-final last year), with three no-results. He made 4070 runs as captain at an average of 37.68 with no hundreds but 31 half-centuries, including 79 in what looks likely to have been his last international innings, against Pakistan in Sharjah in April. I'm thinking of celebrating my 40th birthday in style next January by going to the West Indies. Do you know who will be touring the Caribbean early next year? asks Dick Wearmouth South Africa will be touring the West Indies early next year for what should be an exciting five-Test series - South Africa won all five Tests of their home series in 1998-99, so West Indies will be looking for revenge in the first series between the sides in the Caribbean (where they have met only in the one-off Test of 1991-92). There will also be several one-day internationals. January may be a little early though - the exact dates have not been announced, but the tour is expected to last from February to April. In the recent three-day match between Glamorgan and the West Indian tourists, there were an inordinate amount of lbws. Has there been an international where all ten wickets have been given out leg-before? asks Paul Canham There were 17 lbws in all in that match at Cardiff, and that's the Test record too. It was set in the match between West Indies and Pakistan at Port-of-Spain in 1992-93. The overworked umpires were Steve Bucknor, who raised the fatal finger 12 times, and Dickie Bird (five). The record for a Test innings is six lbws, which has happened 11 times. In one-day internationals the record is five lbws in an innings (five instances) and eight in a match (two). To settle a bet, what was the nickname of Allan Border? asks Gavin Chesher In the later stages of his career Border was known simply as \"AB\". Earlier he was known for a while as \"Captain Grumpy\" - but that name became less and less appropriate as Australia started winning regularly. And before he became captain he was briefly known as \"Pugsley\", because of a supposed resemblance to one of the characters in the Addams Family! Where was Fred Trueman born? asks Ken Main Frederick Sewards Trueman was born in Scotch Springs, Stainton, near Maltby in Yorkshire, on February 6, 1931. He made his debut for Yorkshire in 1949, and played his first Test in 1952. In 1964 he became the first bowler to take 300 wickets in Tests, and he finished up with 307. For The Observer's interview with him about his new-ball partner Brian Statham, who died this month, click here. Sixteen years ago I used to play for Hoddesdon Cricket Club in Hertfordshire, and would like to catch up with them again. Do you know how I could contact the club? asks M Hick Hoddesdon CC do seem to be still going strong. According to the Club Cricket Conference, their secretary is Mr DG Sutherland, 8 Burnside, Hoddesdon, Herts EN11 8PG. Have England confirmed where they will be touring this winter (2000-01)? asks Pete Whittaker England will start with their first tour of Pakistan since 1987-88, and will be making a nervous return to the Iqbal Stadium in Faisalabad, scene of the incident between Mike Gatting and umpire Shakoor Rana which disfigured that tour. There will be three one-day internationals - at Karachi (Oct 24), Lahore (Oct 27) and Rawalpindi (Oct 29) - followed by three Tests, at Lahore (Nov 15-19), Faisalabad (Nov 29-Dec 3), and Karachi (Dec 7-11). After a break for Christmas, England undertake a similar programme in Sri Lanka. The Tests will be at Galle (Feb 22-26), Kandy (March 7-11) and Colombo (March 15-19), and the ODIs will all be in Colombo (March 23, 25 and 27). Who was the England player who broke his kneecap on tour in the early 1990s? asks Peter Drake The unfortunate man was David \"Syd\" Lawrence, the big-hearted Gloucestershire fast bowler. He had just started his third over in the closing stages of the drawn third Test against New Zealand at Wellington in February 1992 when he fell to the ground in agony. Other players spoke of hearing a noise like a gunshot as his kneecap broke in half. Lawrence, who was 28 at the time, never played for England again (this was his fifth cap), although he did make a brave but short-lived comeback for Gloucestershire. I've got stuck on a crossword question: The New Ball (Cricket) - six letters (starts with C, fifth letter R). Can you help? asks Tony French I think the word you're looking for is \"cherry\" - that's what some of our more poetic commentators and even players call the ball when it's a bright shiny red.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The 20th century saw massive growth in English language teaching, dominated by the United States and Britain. Now the demographics of English are changing, and this is influencing the debate about how English is being taught. One area where debate is now raging is over the use of the learner's first language (L1) in the classroom rather than the second language (L2, here, English). In the methodology proposed by the core countries - the US and Britain - the use of L1 was strongly discouraged, but times have changed and there are now two opposing camps.</p> <p>Supporters of only L2 claim that children do not learn with reference to another language. This model has been the basis of all 20th century teaching methodologies. Using L2 meant that learners got lots of practice in speaking and listening to English and had to \"negotiate\" meaning if they did not understand. </p> <p>Many of the teaching techniques were developed for use in multi-lingual classes in Britain, where the use of L1 was not an option, and then exported. The exclusive use of L2 also meant the supremacy of the native speaker. Cynics in the opposing camp pointed out that while the methodologists themselves only spoke English, their assertions also meant that coursebooks could be published in English and sold around the world, and that native English teachers were a great export. The dominant methodologies of the 20th century were direct methods (like the Berlitz Method) and the audio-lingual methods, which involved carefully controlled practice and repetition of sentences - all in English. In some schools translation was, and still remains, a sackable offence.</p> <p>In recent years, however, even native speakers, who would seem to have a vested interest in the continuing exclusive use of L2, have started to challenge this legacy. Professor Guy Cook of Reading University has given lectures challenging the dominance of 20th-century fashions. Philip Prowse, author of highly successful coursebooks, suggests that native speakers are a useful resource, and that \"every school should have one\", but that they are not much more useful than that.</p> <p>Reformers claim that, by trumpeting the benefits of native speakers you devalue non-native speakers. By insisting only L2 is used you neglect the advantages that using L1 can bring. By applying teaching techniques developed in one situation to another situation you are blindly following ideology. </p> <p>It is now recognised that learners learn in different ways, and that some learners prefer to learn through L1 - who is to say that they shouldn't? Indeed most learners do use L1, and rather than creating a new language store, they mentally map the L2 on to the existing L1, drawing connections, contrasting ideas and viewing the L2 through their L1.</p> <p>The changing demographics of global ELT have sharpened the debate. Most English teachers are non-natives. Most people in the world already speak more than one language. Soon more people will speak English as a second or foreign language than speak it as a first language. So why should native speakers of English, who often speak only one language and are a minority, dictate how English is taught? A more balanced view is needed.</p> <p>Non-native speakers have a choice: they can use L1 or they can play a game of \"Let's pretend I don't speak it - only use English\". There have been cases of successful teachers going on training course in Britain and, on their return, abandoning all they did before in favour of communicative language teaching using only L2. They were seduced by the fun and gloss of teaching techniques developed in an entirely different teaching context than their own. This is tragic, as non-native speakers should value themselves and their techniques. This includes the use of L1. While activities should be conducted in English so as to give practice using English, much can be done in L1. Learners can discuss their problems with their teachers. The L1 can be contrasted with L2, a knowledge of the L1 gives the teacher an enormous advantage in predicting problems and difficulties in learning the L2 and translation - another 20th- century taboo - can be used. Using the L1 in a principled way is the key.</p> <p>Choices have to be made: when to use L1, and how much to use. Can this be usefully done in L2? Is this a waste of an opportunity for practice or communication?</p> <p>Native-speakers do not have this choice, and the lack of knowledge of the learners' L1 is a handicap - to teach a simple word such as \"garlic\" involves a great deal of description or use of a picture (does every teacher have a picture of garlic?). It is much simpler to translate such words. Garlic is garlic.</p> <p>Of course native speakers have other advantages: learners have to use L2 to talk to them. But how stressful is that when there is a problem? By using the learners' L1 badly the teacher can show that making mistakes is not a big deal. By trying to learn their L1 the teacher shows respect for their language and culture, and it can also make your students laugh.</p> <p><strong>The pros and cons of using L1</strong></p> <p>In an ideal world learners will want to use English as much as possible. Teachers should try to encourage learners to choose to use English even when they could use L1. L1 should only be used as a tool to achieve specific aims. Although it is possible to learn a language only using L2, it's probably easier and less stressful when L1 is used in a disciplined way.</p> <p><strong>When L1 is useful...</strong></p> <p>\u0095 Translating some words - especially concrete nouns.</p> <p>\u0095 Highlighting false friends, collocations and partial synonyms between languages.</p> <p>\u0095 Discussing grammar differences between languages.</p> <p>\u0095 Discussing abstract grammar ideas with learners - especially at lower levels.</p> <p>\u0095 Explaining teaching approaches to learners.</p> <p><strong>...and when it's not</strong></p> <p>\u0095 Over use can mean dependency. Learners may not feel they understand unless they understand exactly in their L1. Exact translation can blur a word's many meanings and different collocations in different languages. It can also lead to a loss of useful language practice.</p> <p>\u0095 Learners should know that they are using L1 for a specific reason: it is the most appropriate technique for that situation.</p> <p>\u0095 All teachers should talk to their class socially in English - for realistic listening and speaking practice, and to show that the teacher values English.</p> <p>\u0095 Robert Buckmaster is an EFL teacher working for the British Council in Poland</p>",

The dominant methodologies of the 20th century were direct methods (like the Berlitz Method) and the audio-lingual methods, which involved carefully controlled practice and repetition of sentences - all in English. In some schools translation was, and still remains, a sackable offence. In recent years, however, even native speakers, who would seem to have a vested interest in the continuing exclusive use of L2, have started to challenge this legacy. Professor Guy Cook of Reading University has given lectures challenging the dominance of 20th-century fashions. Philip Prowse, author of highly successful coursebooks, suggests that native speakers are a useful resource, and that \"every school should have one\", but that they are not much more useful than that. Reformers claim that, by trumpeting the benefits of native speakers you devalue non-native speakers. By insisting only L2 is used you neglect the advantages that using L1 can bring. By applying teaching techniques developed in one situation to another situation you are blindly following ideology. It is now recognised that learners learn in different ways, and that some learners prefer to learn through L1 - who is to say that they shouldn't? Indeed most learners do use L1, and rather than creating a new language store, they mentally map the L2 on to the existing L1, drawing connections, contrasting ideas and viewing the L2 through their L1. The changing demographics of global ELT have sharpened the debate. Most English teachers are non-natives. Most people in the world already speak more than one language. Soon more people will speak English as a second or foreign language than speak it as a first language. So why should native speakers of English, who often speak only one language and are a minority, dictate how English is taught? A more balanced view is needed. Non-native speakers have a choice: they can use L1 or they can play a game of \"Let's pretend I don't speak it - only use English\". There have been cases of successful teachers going on training course in Britain and, on their return, abandoning all they did before in favour of communicative language teaching using only L2. They were seduced by the fun and gloss of teaching techniques developed in an entirely different teaching context than their own. This is tragic, as non-native speakers should value themselves and their techniques. This includes the use of L1. While activities should be conducted in English so as to give practice using English, much can be done in L1. Learners can discuss their problems with their teachers. The L1 can be contrasted with L2, a knowledge of the L1 gives the teacher an enormous advantage in predicting problems and difficulties in learning the L2 and translation - another 20th- century taboo - can be used. Using the L1 in a principled way is the key. Choices have to be made: when to use L1, and how much to use. Can this be usefully done in L2? Is this a waste of an opportunity for practice or communication? Native-speakers do not have this choice, and the lack of knowledge of the learners' L1 is a handicap - to teach a simple word such as \"garlic\" involves a great deal of description or use of a picture (does every teacher have a picture of garlic?). It is much simpler to translate such words. Garlic is garlic. Of course native speakers have other advantages: learners have to use L2 to talk to them. But how stressful is that when there is a problem? By using the learners' L1 badly the teacher can show that making mistakes is not a big deal. By trying to learn their L1 the teacher shows respect for their language and culture, and it can also make your students laugh. The pros and cons of using L1 In an ideal world learners will want to use English as much as possible. Teachers should try to encourage learners to choose to use English even when they could use L1. L1 should only be used as a tool to achieve specific aims. Although it is possible to learn a language only using L2, it's probably easier and less stressful when L1 is used in a disciplined way. When L1 is useful... \u0095 Translating some words - especially concrete nouns. \u0095 Highlighting false friends, collocations and partial synonyms between languages. \u0095 Discussing grammar differences between languages. \u0095 Discussing abstract grammar ideas with learners - especially at lower levels. \u0095 Explaining teaching approaches to learners. ...and when it's not \u0095 Over use can mean dependency. Learners may not feel they understand unless they understand exactly in their L1. Exact translation can blur a word's many meanings and different collocations in different languages. It can also lead to a loss of useful language practice. \u0095 Learners should know that they are using L1 for a specific reason: it is the most appropriate technique for that situation. \u0095 All teachers should talk to their class socially in English - for realistic listening and speaking practice, and to show that the teacher values English. \u0095 Robert Buckmaster is an EFL teacher working for the British Council in Poland",

      "bodyText": "Almost half British authors earn less than the \u00a35,000 yearly minimum wage and three quarters make less than the national average of \u00a320,000, a survey found yesterday. The survey - the first to be carried out for nearly 20 years - shows that the universal creative dream of self-sufficiency through writing is receding farther than ever. Despite publishing hype about a tiny number of high earners, only one writer in seven can now afford to live on earnings from writing. This number has been shrinking steadily for some 40 years. In 1966, nearly half of authors could rely on their output as a sole source of income. By 1971, this had fallen to less than a third. By the time of a survey conducted by the Society of Authors in 1981, it was down to less than a sixth. \"The trend continues down,\" says the new survey in the society's journal, The Author.

Caked on to the front of Omana Gangadharan's house, a 70s brick terrace with a neat front lawn, the dried yokes are the only evidence of several ugly things that have recently been hurled at the woman inside. It's not locks or barbed wire that keep Omana Gangadharan trapped inside her home but the words that have fallen through her letterbox and been spat down her telephone.</p> <p>It began on February 25 this year. Gangadharan answered the phone in her family home in East Ham, east London, to hear a man's voice telling her he was going to rip out her uterus. She was so shocked that she hung up. Earlier that evening, her house had been pelted with stones and bottles. No one inside was hurt but the timing was significant: it was the eve of the launch of Gangadharan's novel, The Final Phase, at the local town hall.</p> <p>The novel tells the story of the postwar immigration to East Ham of Malayalees (the people of Kerala, south India). It was a departure from the writer's previous work, which had been set in India and serialised in various regional publications, and it was published with the aid of a grant from the Peabody Trust.</p> <p>A week before the launch, Gangadharan gave a copy to a friend and it began to circulate in East Ham's Malayalee community. \"The story relates to the life of every immigrant who has come here,\" she explains. \"I wanted to write about the experience of being invited but not welcomed.\" Set on the Poet's Estate, home to 10,000 of Newham's Malayalees, the novel fictionalises the arrival of a generation of men who came to Britain in the 50s from India and Singapore. Gangadharan, a 46-year-old mother of two who arrived in East Ham from Kerala 27 years ago, chose Newham, she says, because \"it's where I've spent more than half my life\".</p> <p>But the setting turned out to be too close to home: outraged by what they saw as caricatures of individual members of the community, some locals began a campaign to stop the book's launch. Phone calls were made asking speakers Gangadharan had invited to the event not to come and leaflets were circulated telling people to stay away. Protesters picketed the town hall. While Gangadharan was inside, her car was vandalised. So, too, were the cars of her best friend and her daughter. Gangadharan says some of the protesters were chanting that she was a prostitute and telling her 26-year-old daughter she'd slept with other members of the family.</p> <p>After the launch, the threats escalated. A message on the answerphone informed Gangadharan's husband and son that they would be stoned to death. The family received death threats through the post. One night, three minicabs were sent to her home in succession. After sending them all away, she received an anonymous phone call. \"He told me the cabs were intended to take me to Epping Forest where I would be stripped, gang-raped and burnt,\" she says. \"He went into detail about how he intended to remove my clothes.\"</p> <p>Even before publication of her book, Gangadharan was well-known within the community, due in part to one of her earlier novels having been made into a Malayalee film. But primarily it was because she got involved, volunteering for an Aids charity and a women's refuge, as ward secretary of the local Labour Party and a translator at the town hall. Then overnight, she became infamous for rubbishing her own community.</p> <p>\"It's clear who she's talking about,\" says Sreejith Sreedharan, cultural secretary of the Malayalee Association of the UK Trust. \"The characters are based on real-life people.\" The shopkeeper who sells \"mouldy vegetables\" and his \"moustached wife\", he says, are based on local people.</p> <p>He objects, too, to Das, a character who develops a penchant for Soho's sex shows: \"The novel gives the impression that the community is illiterate, dependent on the state and has no sexual morals.\" Sreedharan says he condemns intimidation and violence but he is campaigning for the book to be withdrawn and \"an unconditional public apology\" to be made to the Malayalee community \"for the insult, distress and discomfort\" they say she has caused.</p> <p>Gangadharan is unrepentant. \"When there are 10,000 people in the community and 200 characters in my book, what name could I possibly have used that didn't belong to someone?\" she asks. \"They say: 'That character must be so-and-so because he's got a gold tooth.' I can think of four people in the community with gold teeth.\"</p> <p>Most of the threats have been sexually violent or have made insinuations about Gangadharan's sexual conduct. Lurking insidiously within the threats, she says, is a potent objection to a woman telling men's stories. \"Until the 70s, immigration to Britain was largely male, so I've written about men's lives - looking for work at Dagenham's Ford factory and, yes, visiting strip joints in Soho. I've written from a male angle and they've said a man helped me. I've never been to Singapore but I spoke to those who have and I visited the Ford factory so that I could describe it. I was not here in postwar Britain, I'm a middle-aged Asian woman sitting at home, so the attitude is: 'How could she write about that?' I'm supposed to remain a housewife, not a person who writes about public life.\"</p> <p>On East Ham's High Road, black, Asian and white residents all claim to care little for the controversy. A white newsagent who has owned the shop for over 20 years argues the case for freedom of speech: \"Otherwise you'll get restrictions that disregard the intelligence of the reader.\" A young Malayalee woman adds: \"People are saying all sorts of things but until I've read it, I can't have an opinion.\"</p> <p>The manager of Newham Bookshop says she received a letter from the Malayalee Association \"suggesting I don't stock the book and asking me to speak to them\". She is remaining neutral, she says: she sells the novel but chooses to keep it under the counter. \"I've sold 15 copies, which is 15 more than I would have sold without the controversy,\" she adds.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Newham Library is still assessing whether it will stock copies. \"Reading the book from outside the community, we see no reason not to stock it,\" a council spokeswoman says, \"unless it has been legally established that it libels individuals. Saying 'I don't like it' is not a good enough reason for us not to keep it.\"</p> <p>Plaistow police have arrested two men for threats to kill Gangadharan, though no one has been charged. She is now too afraid to leave her home. She has stopped her community work and her health has deteriorated, she says, but she insists she will not apologise. \"When I write, I have to be free,\" she says. \"I'm living in London and I write for the whole community. I can't be confined to writing about an Indian woman looking after children and going to the temple.\"</p>",

A week before the launch, Gangadharan gave a copy to a friend and it began to circulate in East Ham's Malayalee community. \"The story relates to the life of every immigrant who has come here,\" she explains. \"I wanted to write about the experience of being invited but not welcomed.\" Set on the Poet's Estate, home to 10,000 of Newham's Malayalees, the novel fictionalises the arrival of a generation of men who came to Britain in the 50s from India and Singapore. Gangadharan, a 46-year-old mother of two who arrived in East Ham from Kerala 27 years ago, chose Newham, she says, because \"it's where I've spent more than half my life\". But the setting turned out to be too close to home: outraged by what they saw as caricatures of individual members of the community, some locals began a campaign to stop the book's launch. Phone calls were made asking speakers Gangadharan had invited to the event not to come and leaflets were circulated telling people to stay away. Protesters picketed the town hall. While Gangadharan was inside, her car was vandalised. So, too, were the cars of her best friend and her daughter. Gangadharan says some of the protesters were chanting that she was a prostitute and telling her 26-year-old daughter she'd slept with other members of the family. After the launch, the threats escalated. A message on the answerphone informed Gangadharan's husband and son that they would be stoned to death. The family received death threats through the post. One night, three minicabs were sent to her home in succession. After sending them all away, she received an anonymous phone call. \"He told me the cabs were intended to take me to Epping Forest where I would be stripped, gang-raped and burnt,\" she says. \"He went into detail about how he intended to remove my clothes.\" Even before publication of her book, Gangadharan was well-known within the community, due in part to one of her earlier novels having been made into a Malayalee film. But primarily it was because she got involved, volunteering for an Aids charity and a women's refuge, as ward secretary of the local Labour Party and a translator at the town hall. Then overnight, she became infamous for rubbishing her own community. \"It's clear who she's talking about,\" says Sreejith Sreedharan, cultural secretary of the Malayalee Association of the UK Trust. \"The characters are based on real-life people.\" The shopkeeper who sells \"mouldy vegetables\" and his \"moustached wife\", he says, are based on local people. He objects, too, to Das, a character who develops a penchant for Soho's sex shows: \"The novel gives the impression that the community is illiterate, dependent on the state and has no sexual morals.\" Sreedharan says he condemns intimidation and violence but he is campaigning for the book to be withdrawn and \"an unconditional public apology\" to be made to the Malayalee community \"for the insult, distress and discomfort\" they say she has caused. Gangadharan is unrepentant. \"When there are 10,000 people in the community and 200 characters in my book, what name could I possibly have used that didn't belong to someone?\" she asks. \"They say: 'That character must be so-and-so because he's got a gold tooth.' I can think of four people in the community with gold teeth.\" Most of the threats have been sexually violent or have made insinuations about Gangadharan's sexual conduct. Lurking insidiously within the threats, she says, is a potent objection to a woman telling men's stories. \"Until the 70s, immigration to Britain was largely male, so I've written about men's lives - looking for work at Dagenham's Ford factory and, yes, visiting strip joints in Soho. I've written from a male angle and they've said a man helped me. I've never been to Singapore but I spoke to those who have and I visited the Ford factory so that I could describe it. I was not here in postwar Britain, I'm a middle-aged Asian woman sitting at home, so the attitude is: 'How could she write about that?' I'm supposed to remain a housewife, not a person who writes about public life.\" On East Ham's High Road, black, Asian and white residents all claim to care little for the controversy. A white newsagent who has owned the shop for over 20 years argues the case for freedom of speech: \"Otherwise you'll get restrictions that disregard the intelligence of the reader.\" A young Malayalee woman adds: \"People are saying all sorts of things but until I've read it, I can't have an opinion.\" The manager of Newham Bookshop says she received a letter from the Malayalee Association \"suggesting I don't stock the book and asking me to speak to them\". She is remaining neutral, she says: she sells the novel but chooses to keep it under the counter. \"I've sold 15 copies, which is 15 more than I would have sold without the controversy,\" she adds. Meanwhile, Newham Library is still assessing whether it will stock copies. \"Reading the book from outside the community, we see no reason not to stock it,\" a council spokeswoman says, \"unless it has been legally established that it libels individuals. Saying 'I don't like it' is not a good enough reason for us not to keep it.\" Plaistow police have arrested two men for threats to kill Gangadharan, though no one has been charged. She is now too afraid to leave her home. She has stopped her community work and her health has deteriorated, she says, but she insists she will not apologise. \"When I write, I have to be free,\" she says. \"I'm living in London and I write for the whole community. I can't be confined to writing about an Indian woman looking after children and going to the temple.\"",

Increasing the sheer volume of bilateral contacts with small and medium-sized EU members, the theory goes, is helping Britain set agendas and win arguments.</p> <p>Mr Blair's warm relationship with Spain's prime minister, Jose Maria Aznar, is the most conspicuous example of step change. With differences over Gibraltar put to one side, the Spanish conservative and Britain's New Labour pioneer of the third way have become powerful and increasingly visible allies.</p> <p>But Portugal, Belgium, the Netherlands, Ireland, Sweden and Denmark have also become important partners across a range of issues.</p> <p>Step change emerged from a brainstorming session in Downing Street in late 1998 as the government sought ways to live up to its pledge to be \"at the heart of Europe\".</p> <p>British officials insist it is not about competing with the Franco-German axis, far weaker now than in its Fran\u00e7ois Mitterand-Helmut Kohl heyday.</p> <p>Step change is as much about economics as politics for the largely centre-left governments - Aznar's Spain is the exception - that now run the 15-member union.</p> <p>Relations with Portugal's Antonio Guterres were crucial in turning March's Lisbon \"dot.com\" summit into a showcase for the structural reforms needed to help Europe catch up with the more dynamic US - and neatly sidestepped the ever neuralgic question of whether Britain would join euroland.</p> <p>Blair has also cultivated Belgium's Guy Verhofstadt, the boyish Liberal prime minister whose \"active welfare\" policies matter more in London than his country's traditional commitment to European integration.</p> <p>Next door in the Netherlands, prime minister Wim Kok is seen as a useful Blair ally on third way issues, even though he too backs EU reforms that his British colleague could never accept.</p> <p>Sweden figures prominently on the list of step change priorities not only because Social Democratic leader Goran Persson will be running the EU's rotating presidency in the first half of next year but also because Stockholm shares Britain's enthusiasm for enlargement to the east. \"Scandinavians are like us,\" says one diplomat. \"They didn't invent the EU either but look at it as a means to an end. They're not ideological or emotional about it like the founding members.\"</p> <p>Looking further ahead in time and space, Foreign Office efforts are starting to focus on Poland, the leading candidate for the next step of EU enlargement. But there is increasing concern that the timetable is slipping.</p> <p>None of this diplomatic creativity solves Blair's enduring problems about what to do about the single currency, with Greece now the 12th member and Denmark and Sweden due to make their choice before any British referendum.</p> <p>Nor does it mean that Britain will get its way in this year's intergovernmental conference, with Paris and Berlin coordinating closely and keen on writing a new agreement on \"flexibility\" into the Treaty of Nice in December.</p> <p>But it does help explain the claim, made by a delighted prime minister as he left Portugal for home yesterday, that Feira marked the end of an era of \"Britain versus the rest\" in Europe.</p> <p><b>What the papers say</b> <br><br> 'Schr\u00f6der and Chirac are expecting too much from the EU by burdening it with the row about strengthened cooperation.

Mr Blair's warm relationship with Spain's prime minister, Jose Maria Aznar, is the most conspicuous example of step change. With differences over Gibraltar put to one side, the Spanish conservative and Britain's New Labour pioneer of the third way have become powerful and increasingly visible allies. But Portugal, Belgium, the Netherlands, Ireland, Sweden and Denmark have also become important partners across a range of issues. Step change emerged from a brainstorming session in Downing Street in late 1998 as the government sought ways to live up to its pledge to be \"at the heart of Europe\". British officials insist it is not about competing with the Franco-German axis, far weaker now than in its Fran\u00e7ois Mitterand-Helmut Kohl heyday. Step change is as much about economics as politics for the largely centre-left governments - Aznar's Spain is the exception - that now run the 15-member union. Relations with Portugal's Antonio Guterres were crucial in turning March's Lisbon \"dot.com\" summit into a showcase for the structural reforms needed to help Europe catch up with the more dynamic US - and neatly sidestepped the ever neuralgic question of whether Britain would join euroland. Blair has also cultivated Belgium's Guy Verhofstadt, the boyish Liberal prime minister whose \"active welfare\" policies matter more in London than his country's traditional commitment to European integration. Next door in the Netherlands, prime minister Wim Kok is seen as a useful Blair ally on third way issues, even though he too backs EU reforms that his British colleague could never accept. Sweden figures prominently on the list of step change priorities not only because Social Democratic leader Goran Persson will be running the EU's rotating presidency in the first half of next year but also because Stockholm shares Britain's enthusiasm for enlargement to the east. \"Scandinavians are like us,\" says one diplomat. \"They didn't invent the EU either but look at it as a means to an end. They're not ideological or emotional about it like the founding members.\" Looking further ahead in time and space, Foreign Office efforts are starting to focus on Poland, the leading candidate for the next step of EU enlargement. But there is increasing concern that the timetable is slipping. None of this diplomatic creativity solves Blair's enduring problems about what to do about the single currency, with Greece now the 12th member and Denmark and Sweden due to make their choice before any British referendum. Nor does it mean that Britain will get its way in this year's intergovernmental conference, with Paris and Berlin coordinating closely and keen on writing a new agreement on \"flexibility\" into the Treaty of Nice in December. But it does help explain the claim, made by a delighted prime minister as he left Portugal for home yesterday, that Feira marked the end of an era of \"Britain versus the rest\" in Europe. What the papers say 'Schr\u00f6der and Chirac are expecting too much from the EU by burdening it with the row about strengthened cooperation. The Paris-Berlin plan is like Fischer's vision: it is right but it is premature' Der Tagesspiegel, Germany 'In one respect, European politics degenerated into farce in Feira: being tied down by unilateral decisionmaking forced the Union to vote for a solution that is no solution. The minority will in future have to bend to the decision of the majority. Otherwise the EU will turn into a lame duck giant' Sueddeutsche Zeitung, Germany 'The summit in Portugal served to highlight the profound identity crisis suffered by the EU, which appears incapable of making progress on its two key medium term goals: enlargement and institutional reform' El Mundo, Spain 'In the face of a revitalised Franco-German axis, Aznar has been poorly served by his close relationship with Blair and euro-unenthusiastic Britain. It would be wise for Mr Aznar to review his alliances . . . he runs the danger of becoming Mr Niet' El Pais, Spain 'Behind yesterday's agreement lies the objective of a unified fiscal policy: without majority decisions we will never achieve it, not even via decade-long postponements' La Stampa, Italy 'A bottle of port, vintage 1981, and all-round smiles on the faces of government officials with the successful conclusion of Greece's entry into the Eurozone is not enough to automatically solve, as if with a magic wand, the country's huge economic and social problems' Ta Nea, Greece 'Sch\u00fcssel can go home to Austria with his head held high. The compromise he accepted at the last minute contains enough safety nets for Austria to be able to change its mind tomorrow, and at the same time the country has its ticket back into the EU fold virtually in the bag' Lib\u00e9ration, France",

      "bodyText": "A nurse has been suspended from an Essex NHS trust as police investigate the deaths of 18 children aged between eight weeks and 17 years. The investigation centres on suspected overdoses of painkillers given to terminally ill children over a three-year period between 1996 and May 1999, says today's Sun newspaper. \"We are investigating allegations made against a nurse from the former Southend community care services NHS trust [now the South Essex mental health and community care NHS trust] concerning care of patients,\" Essex police said in a statement. \"The police were called in by the trust following concerns raised by an unrelated internal investigation. The nurse is currently suspended by the trust. \"Police officers and clinicians from the trust have visited families involved in the investigation and given them information about it and offer any support required,\" Essex police said. Police would not comment on whether any bodies of children would have to be exhumed as part of the inquiry. The nurse, who is in her 40s and has worked in several hospitals during a long career, including London's world-famous Great Ormond Street hospital, was suspended last year four days after the mother of one boy wrote a letter of complaint about her to health bosses. The letter is said to have complained of \"serious misgivings\" about the professional conduct of the nurse which, the parent said, had \"jeopardised and compromised\" her son's treatment. A spokesman for the UKCC, nursing's regulatory body, said it was sending the woman a letter today telling her she faced interim suspension from the nursing register. The nurse would probably be formally suspended for the interim within the next three weeks, the spokesman said. \"We have to give people notice of interim suspension and a committee has to consider the case but we have moved to act very quickly today,\" he said. \"She will face interim suspension while the police investigation is carried out.\" The move will stop the nurse from working anywhere in the country, as well as at the hospital trust where she was employed and from which she has already been suspended. The Sun reports that Essex police have been in contact with colleagues in Lincolnshire who helped convict hospital nurse Beverley Allitt. Allitt was dubbed The Angel of Death after killing four young children while she worked at Grantham Hospital in the early 1990s. She also attacked and injured a further nine young children, leaving some of them severely disabled. She was arrested after a major investigation and later sentenced to 13 life sentences at Nottingham crown court and told there was no chance that she would ever be released.

The deputy head, Peter Sainsbury, and five other teachers found jobs elsewhere.

The chairman of the governors, John Heamon, said the school had been \"wrecked\" by the decision. Parents were told by the authority on Monday.</p> <p>The council said the past 12 months \"have been a stressful period for staff at the school\".

      "bodyText": "All 12 teachers at a primary school have resigned in the wake of an inspection by the Office for Standards in Education. Moor Lane junior school in Chessington, south-west London, was found to have \"serious weaknesses\" by inspectors last April. The headteacher, Jane Wright, announced she was retiring, blaming the pressure of paperwork. The deputy head, Peter Sainsbury, and five other teachers found jobs elsewhere. All are due to leave at the end of this term. Ofsted returned for a follow-up inspection last month and told Ms Wright and school governors chairman, John Heamon, that \"insufficient progress\" had been made. \"Teaching staff considered that their efforts over the past 12 months had not been recognised in the progress report and consequently the remaining staff tendered their resignations,\" Kingston local education authority said in a statement. The chairman of the governors, John Heamon, said the school had been \"wrecked\" by the decision. Parents were told by the authority on Monday. The council said the past 12 months \"have been a stressful period for staff at the school\". A head and deputy head have been seconded from other schools and three teachers appointed. Interviews for the other jobs are being carried out over the next three weeks. A spokesman for Ofsted said the resignations were \"unfortunate\" and would \"leave the school facing a very difficult situation\". He said: \"It's not something we welcome. It's clearly a matter for them and their consciences and it's something that the governors and the LEA are going to have to address. What matters is the education of the children - that's what inspections are about. It's keeping parents informed about what is going on in the schools.\" The school had made \"negligible progress\" in implementing its action plan after last year's inspection, and was not doing enough to address serious weaknesses. It emerged this week that 23 of 55 teachers at Kingswood high school, a \"fresh start\" school in Hull, have handed in their notice. \u0095 The government will fail to meet national targets for achievement in English unless standards in children's writing is dramatically improved over the next year, Ofsted warned yesterday, writes Rebecca Smithers . It blamed teachers in primary schools for concentrating on reading rather than writing in the daily literacy hour. In a discussion paper published on its website, Ofsted said the teaching of writing was \"unsatisfactory\" in a quarter of all such lessons. The education and employment secrtetary David Blunkett has said he will resign if 80% of final year primary school pupils fail in the national tests to reach the expected standard in literacy by 2002, and 75% fail to achieve the same level in numeracy.",

I knew I'd never get into the game, but I wasn't there to watch football. I was there to watch football hooligans. </p> <p>Then something unexpected happened: I became a hooligan sympathiser.

Virtually all of the so-called \"hooligans\" I met were actually decent fans who had been shafted outrageously by Uefa and by the host city of Charleroi. Many of them were \"detained\" for a few hours by chip-on-the-shoulder Belgian police for no crime other than showing up in a relentlessly unhelpful host city and trying to find a spot to watch the game. </p> <p>One such unfortunate was a 31-year-old Arsenal fan. He told me he had sent off his application for Euro 2000 tickets on the first day of sale last year, requesting seats for any England game. Months later, he received two tickets for a match between Yugoslavia and Slovenia. Thanks a lot, Uefa. The Arsenal man told me that when he went to a website to try to arrange a swap - on the theory that Uefa had probably pulled a similar trick on some poor Slovenian fan - he received an officious email warning him that his tickets would be voided, without refund, if he passed them to any other person. </p> <p>\"It's the real fan who gets passed over,\" the Arsenal man told me. \"The guys in suits and the corporate sponsors get big blocs of seats, and there's nothing left over for me and my mates.\" </p> <p>Uefa, in its wisdom, made things even worse by putting the England-Germany match - a high-profile contest between two of the tournament's most populous nations - in one of the smallest venues available.

In Place Charles II, the big central square where the \"riot\" occurred, there were no outdoor television screens, no loudspeakers, not even a scoreboard. (There was a traffic sign flashing the phrase \"Be Fair Play\", whatever that means.) The only way the ticketless England fan could see the game was to find a bar that had a TV set, grab a chair, and stay in it. Since the bars had no tolerance for customers who weren't spending money, you had to keep on buying beer, hour after hour, to hold your place until game time. </p> <p>Some people in the square that Saturday afternoon, perhaps 100 or more, were swinish thugs who seemed to be looking for trouble from the beginning.

It was a download rather than a statement; Mr Blair spoke at around 9,600 baud, letting the words tumble out as if he had an urgent appointment with a dirty nappy.</p> <p>Mr Hague rose to agree with some parts of this sustained gabble: the single market, the campaign against drugs and so on. Then he added: \"May I also congratulate him on the fact that after many years of difficult negotiations, carefully crafted compromises and repeated isolation, he has finally got the foreign secretary and the chancellor to talk to each other?\"</p> <p>This is becoming the standard, template Hague joke: a three-section series of cliches, followed by a punchline which reverses the listener's expectation. It's fairly amusing, but it is becoming predictable; he may soon hear MPs chanting along with him.</p> <p>Anyhow, Robin Cook turned to Gordon Brown and smiled incredulously, as if it were the most hilariously misbegotten joke he had ever heard. The very thought, he seemed to imply, that we might not be the closest of friends! Why, his heartfelt grin seemed to say, we are famous as the David and Jonathan of British politics!</p> <p>Mr Brown's facial response was slightly less enthusiastic. For there is no reason to believe that this rift is at an end.

      "bodyText": "The prime minister had given his account of the European summit meeting in Portugal. It was a download rather than a statement; Mr Blair spoke at around 9,600 baud, letting the words tumble out as if he had an urgent appointment with a dirty nappy. Mr Hague rose to agree with some parts of this sustained gabble: the single market, the campaign against drugs and so on. Then he added: \"May I also congratulate him on the fact that after many years of difficult negotiations, carefully crafted compromises and repeated isolation, he has finally got the foreign secretary and the chancellor to talk to each other?\" This is becoming the standard, template Hague joke: a three-section series of cliches, followed by a punchline which reverses the listener's expectation. It's fairly amusing, but it is becoming predictable; he may soon hear MPs chanting along with him. Anyhow, Robin Cook turned to Gordon Brown and smiled incredulously, as if it were the most hilariously misbegotten joke he had ever heard. The very thought, he seemed to imply, that we might not be the closest of friends! Why, his heartfelt grin seemed to say, we are famous as the David and Jonathan of British politics! Mr Brown's facial response was slightly less enthusiastic. For there is no reason to believe that this rift is at an end. Like those Sherlock Holmes stories in which it turns out that the murder was committed because of events in Utah 50 years earlier, this feud dates back to a dark Caledonian revenge tragedy. Back in 1972, young Robin, having been secretary of the Edinburgh Labour party, moved to seek his political fortune in London. Gordon, five years younger, and then the student rector of Edinburgh university, went to ask for his backing as the next party boss. \"I'm sure you'll be very successful,\" said Robin, but refused to give him his public support. Gordon has neither forgotten nor forgiven. Periodically, kind friends and colleagues try to mortice them together, but after a short chat, this invariably fails. All this may seem bewilderingly trivial to you, especially compared to the question of the euro, or events in Sierra Leone, but that is to underestimate the sheer swirling maelstrom of hatred which is the Scottish Labour party, upon which umbrage lies as thick as winter snow on Ben More. Earlier, during prime minister's questions, Mr Hague tried to stir up trouble over the probable decision not to let the NHS prescribe beta interferon for multiple sclerosis sufferers. Mr Blair had done his homework - it turned out, to nobody's surprise, that the Tories had also rationed expensive drugs - so Mr Hague contented himself with one of those soundbites which he and his team pray will make the early evening news: \"He is blaming everybody else for every problem which ever comes into his view.\" The smartest riposte came from David Amess, the Tory MP who took the \"chicken run\" from Basildon to Southend before the last election.

      "bodyText": "Two Chinese men suspected of being members of the gang responsible for the deaths of 58 illegal immigrants in a lorry at Dover have been arrested, Kent police revealed last night. The pair, alleged to have played a junior role in the operation, are from London and surrendered to police in Kent on Tuesday evening. A police source confirmed that the men, who are being held in Canterbury, were not the two survivors, but two suspected gang members involved at a low level. \"We're not talking about Mr Big here,\" he said. Police were continuing to question the driver of the lorry, and have until the early hours of tomorrow to charge or release him. Meanwhile in Rotterdam, the Dutch port where the lorry was registered, the justice ministry revealed that it had made a second arrest. Dutch police confirmed the man they arrested on Tuesday night was Arjan van der Spek, 24, the owner of the white Mercedes lorry, while a second unnamed man also in custody is believed to be van der Spek's 55-year-old father. A source said: \"We are holding them for questioning as long as is necessary. They will be brought before the magistrates on Friday. We don't exclude further arrests.\" As the net began to close on the racketeers, it emerged the death toll in the Dover tragedy could have been even greater. Eight more people tried to board the doomed lorry before it left Rotterdam last weekend, according to a solicitor acting for Chinese asylum applicants. Wah-Piow Tan said the eight were unable to board because the vehicle was already overcrowded, and remained behind in the Netherlands. Five families in the UK, who believe relatives of theirs could be among the dead, have contacted the solicitor. Mr Tan will meet Home Office officials to discuss how his clients can come forward without endangering their immigration status. \"My clients are in a grey area. Some of them are awaiting the result of asylum applications and others have been refused asylum but have not yet departed,\" he said. \"What is required of the Home Office is a political, humanitarian decision to grant exceptional leave to remain to anyone who comes forward with information that can help the police identify these people.\" The Belgian interior ministry yesterday admitted that it may have briefly detained some of the 58 who died but had let them walk free because its detention centres were full. In an admission which is likely to spark a debate about just how effective European cooperation on asylum really is, the Belgian authorities disclosed they had detained a similar group of Chinese asylum seekers just two months ago. It is customary Belgian practice for asylum applicants to be held in a detention centre, and if their application fails, to be flown back to their country of origin. In this case, police simply told the Chinese to leave Belgium and put them on a train to the port city of Antwerp unescorted. Controversially, the group was told to steer clear of countries which along with Belgium have signed up to the Schengen open borders agreement - the UK has not. No Belgian official bothered to check what became of them and the episode has drawn criticism from Kent police. A source complained: \"The Belgians openly send people out of Belgium without escorting them, which obviously opens up the opportunity for them to come into the UK.\" Another source said: \"I would say that we have an excellent relationship with their police. But the sort of decision we are looking at is a political issue.\" Belgium's interior ministry yesterday said that it had fingerprinted the Chinese group, intercepted on April 16 in two villages near Antwerp called Bornem and Puurs. These fingerprints have been passed to the British police who are trying to establish a match. Officers hope for results later today. A Belgian police spokesman admitted that the country's immigration service had been aware at the time that the group was involved in \"illegal people trading\". The country's interior ministry was yesterday adamant, however, that it had done absolutely nothing wrong. Pascal Smet, a ministry spokesman, told the BBC: \"Belgium is not a police state where we put a police agent against every person and where we follow people.\" A British Home Office spokesman said: \"Immigration by its very nature is a cross-border problem and it's important for us all to work together.\" Film footage of the Chinese immigrants taken by a Belgian TV station shows a smartly dressed group of young people, occasionally smiling, and chatting to each other. It is unclear why they chose to use the sleepy town of Puurs (population 16,000, one pub and zero crime) as a stopping-off point. The exclusively white community of Puurs first noticed two Chinese men arrive in March. They rented a one-bedroom flat which had no furniture and rarely went out. Greetye Mouton, 35, a baker, said: \"They seemed to have a fair amount of money on them, but they spoke no French and very little English. \"All they could say was 'Can we have some bread' or 'give me a Coca Cola'.\" But they would buy eight loaves of bread every day which I thought was strange for just two people.

In a pioneering move, which follows growing pressure from readers amid alarm at an escalation in the numbers of women suffering from eating disorders, the planned code is also aimed at encouraging the fashion industry to produce and promote clothes for a wider range of body sizes and shapes. Advertisements which use images of ultra-thin women, or which promote plastic surgery in an unacceptable way, could also be banned. Meanwhile, in a further move prompted by the government-organised body image summit yesterday, the broadcasting standards commission is to monitor media images on television in an attempt to evaluate whether a sufficiently diverse group of women appear as presenters and guests. The full details of how the study will be conducted are yet to be decided. But Conservatives were quick to criticise it as \"fatty monitoring\". The offer to adopt a code of self-regulation - similar to the code covering privacy adopted by newspapers - was put forward by magazine editors at yesterday's summit. Ministers are concerned at evidence that media images of super-thin models are stripping women of their confidence and self-esteem. Although the government will not issue its own prescriptive regulations on the issue to the media or fashion industries, Tessa Jowell, the minister for women, is concerned at the potential influence of images such as the superwaif and \"heroin chic\" shots in fashion magazines. Around 1m people in the UK are estimated to suffer from an eating disorder, the majority of them women. Teenage girls are particularly at risk, according to recent research, but children as young as six are also conscious of pressure to lose weight. According to a study on body image, eating disorders and the media published this year by the British Medical Association, models and actresses today generally have 10-15% body fat whereas the average body fat for a healthy woman is 22-26%. The self-regulatory body will be made up of top magazine editors, fashion stylists, photographers and young readers who will monitor the contents of fashion pages and keep a check on the model industry. The editor of Marie Claire magazine, Liz Jones, said: \"The fashion industry is a very rarefied world and I think it has become a bit divorced from reality recently. \"A code of self-regulation would mean that if an agency sent us a very thin model whose bones were showing through her skin, then we would send her back and write to the agency as well as other magazines telling them not to use her.\" The Conservatives attacked the BSC monitoring of women on television as ludicrous.

Labour said Tim Bush, 38, a former PricewaterhouseCoopers accountant, wanted to \"return to a commercial career for personal reasons\" after working for the party for two and a half years.</p> <p>His departure underlines the problems faced by Mr Blair. \"They've either not got the money, don't want to donate any more or can't stand the hassle,\" said a key figure involved in discussions with donors. \"The climate has definitely changed since 1997 and the honeymoon after the victory.\"</p> <p>The reluctance of wealthy figures to fill the party's coffers leaves Labour more heavily dependent on the unions, which will shortly promise around \u00a38m for the election war chest. But they are also proving troublesome; the Communications Workers Union is refusing to increase its political levy to raise an extra \u00a3200,000.</p> <p>Labour is also haemorrhaging members. Officially the total has fallen from 405,000 to 387,776 since the election.

      "bodyText": "Labour is struggling to raise money from wealthy business people in the latest signal that industry's love affair with Tony Blair is over. Party officials charged with creating a war chest to fight next year's election are finding it increasingly difficult to persuade would-be donors to part with their money - a clear sign that the broad coalition which swept Labour into power is under severe strain. The head of Millbank's business unit is to quit his post next month as well-heeled sympathisers and former supporters refuse to back the party financially. Labour said Tim Bush, 38, a former PricewaterhouseCoopers accountant, wanted to \"return to a commercial career for personal reasons\" after working for the party for two and a half years. His departure underlines the problems faced by Mr Blair. \"They've either not got the money, don't want to donate any more or can't stand the hassle,\" said a key figure involved in discussions with donors. \"The climate has definitely changed since 1997 and the honeymoon after the victory.\" The reluctance of wealthy figures to fill the party's coffers leaves Labour more heavily dependent on the unions, which will shortly promise around \u00a38m for the election war chest. But they are also proving troublesome; the Communications Workers Union is refusing to increase its political levy to raise an extra \u00a3200,000. Labour is also haemorrhaging members. Officially the total has fallen from 405,000 to 387,776 since the election. However, senior party figures believe the true membership is nearer the 305,000 inherited by Mr Blair from John Smith in 1994. Three years ago defeating the Tories cost Labour \u00a326m but the pressure will be eased next year by the proposed \u00a320m cap on election spending for each party. Ministers and Labour officials are now confident the proposed ceiling will be law by the election, even if Mr Blair sticks to his original plan and calls a spring poll. The bill imposing the cap is currently becalmed in the House of Lords where a legislative logjam is building up. Recent speculation suggested that ministers would not mind jettisoning the bill, which would postpone the cap until the following election. That would have given Labour the freedom to spend far more than \u00a320m in order to ensure a historic second term for the party. But ministers and officials, aware of the uphill task to raise \u00a320m, let alone \u00a326m, have decided to make the cap a priority. Labour is also aware that the finances of the Conservatives, which are currently reliant on Lord Ashcroft, could be transformed by the decision of Paul Sykes, the Yorkshire Eurosceptic multimillionaire, to rejoin the Tory party. He had been planning to give the anti-single currency Democracy Movement as much as \u00a320m and has already hinted he may be willing to give the Tories a minimum of \u00a32m. Labour's relationship with big business has cooled after a series of clashes over employment rights, the high pound, the minimum wage and new business regulations. The party's decision to name all donors over \u00a35,000 - copied by the Tories after the Home Secretary, Jack Straw, declared it would be enshrined in law - has put off some supporters who fear the attendant publicity. \"The system needed cleaning up and we have done it,\" said a Millbank source. \"If we were to take a short-term hit as a result, creating some sort of short-term problems, we just have to say it was the right thing to do. We needed to restore public trust in politics.\" Labour's target is to raise 40% of its funds from small donors, 30% from unions, 20% from big donors and 10% from commercial activities. Party accounts for last year, due to be published next month, are expected to show Labour operating a small surplus. It is the election fund that is worrying party bosses . Ahead of the 1997 election, Labour pocketed six donations of \u00a31m or more plus another two worth \u00a3500,000. Lord Sainsbury of Turville was one of the \u00a31m donors and, after becoming science minister, disclosed last year that he had handed over another \u00a32m. But Bernie Ecclestone, the Formula One magnate, is unlikely to donate again after Mr Blair sent back his seven-figure gift during the row over tobacco advertising. Another member of the \u00a31m club, Matthew Harding, the deputy chairman of Chelsea football club, died in a helicopter crash. The party has also fallen out with the former boss of Creation records, Alan McGee, once a favourite at Downing Street receptions, after he accused Mr Blair of copying Conservative policies. A trawl of the accounts of 3,000 public and private companies by the independent Labour Research Department before Christmas found only 10 had donated \u00a3200 or more to the party.",

      "body": "<p>The government yesterday urged British football to introduce a voluntary quota on the number of foreign players, blaming England's premature departure from Euro 2000 on the influx of foreign stars to the Premier League. </p> <p>The call to show restraint was made by the employment minister, Margaret Hodge, who is responsible for overseeing work permits for foreign stars. She insisted that a voluntary curb could be implemented by English clubs and the Football Association without breaching EU laws on the freedom of movement of labour. \"It is unrealistic to think European labour market rules can be changed just for football, but there is absolutely nothing to stop football bodies taking control of this themselves,\" Ms Hodge said. \"There is a lot to say for football authorities agreeing among themselves they will only play a proportion of players from abroad. Football clubs do not have to go out and buy foreign players and the European court cannot intervene.\" </p> <p>The influx of foreign players has often been highlighted as a contributing factor to the decline of the national side, with claims that footballing mercenaries are taking the places of promising English youngsters who find it increasingly difficult to break into the top sides. The England manager, Kevin Keegan, has himself called for a cap on the number of foreigners, saying his pool of talent is smaller than it should be. </p> <p>But last night the Premier League sharply disagreed with Ms Hodge, saying quotas would break the Bosman ruling of the European court of justice in 1995 which ruled they were unlawful. </p> <p>Whatever the outcome of the government's demand, a growing body of opinion in the game believes the national side's poor performance at Euro 2000 had little to do with the number of foreign players in the Premiership, and more with the structure and style of football in England. </p> <p>On the surface English football has never been in ruder health. The Premier League has just signed one of the most lucrative television deals in football history, bringing \u00a31.6bn into the game over the next three years. Even on the continent few would argue that England has one of the most exciting leagues. Top stars can earn anything from \u00a320,000 to \u00a350,000 a week. In financial terms the Premiership is the biggest league in the world, with a turnover of \u00a3169m more than its nearest rival, Italy's Serie A. </p> <p>But despite the huge sums of money that have been injected into domestic football, the national side has consistently failed to make it at the highest level, displaying skills far below that of its supposedly poorer counterparts. According to some analysts, at the heart of the problem is the massive discrepancy between the biggest clubs and the grassroots. </p> <p>The Premier League, formed in 1992 when the top clubs broke away from the rest of the football league to secure more revenue from television, is a money making machine for the top clubs, which have become multimillion pound businesses in their own right. </p> <p><strong> Grassroots problems</strong><br> </p> <p> According to accountants Deloitte and Touche, football has been growing over the last decade at a rate that other businesses would die for, but only a small percentage of the money has filtered down. </p> <p>The problems at the grassroots level were illustrated by the news yesterday that non-league club Deal Town, who won the amateur FA Vase at Wembley last month, have given their supporters three weeks to raise \u00a320,000 to save the club from folding, a sum for which David Beckham would barely kneel to tie a bootlace. </p> <p>Alex Fynn, a football consultant who was one of the architects of the Premier League, said that while the rest of Europe operated a pyramid system, with a semi professional level rising up gradually to a showcase top division, in England all the power and money is concentrated at the top. The result is that the national team is seen as a hindrance by many top clubs, who resent the fact they have to release players for international duty. Clubs are unlikely to accept a self imposed quota on foreigners to help the national side when continental players are some of their most important stars. </p> <p>\"Clubs in Europe play fewer games than in England and they play them in such a way as to give the national team time and space to play,\" Mr Fynn said. \"In England the national team has to be fitted around domestic fixtures because of the power and money of the Premier League.\" </p> <p>But the problems of English football are not purely financial. According to John Williams, lecturer at the Sir Norman Chester centre for football research at Leicester University, the national team's failings can be attributed to \"an almost wilful desire not to modernise\". </p> <p>\"English football has always had a fear of thinkers and tacticians, preferring instead to rely on size, speed, brute force and team spirit. But when it comes to international football you need to be able to think on the ball.\" </p> <p>Competitive matches are played at a very young age by footballers whose skills have not been properly developed. In many countries, including Holland, Spain and Romania, the emphasis until the age of 11 or 12 is on ball skills rather than playing competitive matches. </p> <p>The one possible light on the horizon for English football are the 40 youth academies set up across the country by Premier and football league clubs. The FA hopes the academies will be a breeding ground for future international stars. </p> <p>The academy system has allowed clubs for the first time to have sole power over the footballing programme of children as young as nine years old. But even at academy level the clubs appear to be set on a collision course with the needs of the national team that is likely to bring them into conflict with the Football Association. Premier League first teams do not observe national boundaries, and there is little reason to imagine their youth academies will either. According to Mike Kelleher, the administrator of the academies for the Premier League, at some point the clubs are going to want to bring young players from all over the world into their academies, forcing out promising English youngsters. </p> <p>But whatever happens it will be at least six years before the first recruits to the club academies begin to filter through to the national team. Roll on Euro 2008. </p> <p> <strong>Why huge sums of money are no guarantee of success</strong> <br> <strong> The star</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Phil Neville (Manchester Utd)</strong> <br>Estimated earnings \u00a31.25m and forecast to rise </p> <p>His mistake may have catapulted his country out of Euro 2000, but that will not prevent Phil Neville thriving. Although he cannot command a regular place in his club side, he is contracted to stay there until 2005. </p> <p>The 23-year-old earns an estimated \u00a320,000 a week, with endorsements on top. Four years ago he was on \u00a31,000 a week. </p> <p>Players like Phil Neville, a talent in the English if not the world game, are the fruit United bore from their youth scheme, which produced players such as his brother Gary, David Beckham, Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt. </p> <p>He captained Manchester United to win the youth cup, making his debut for the first team aged 18 in 1995. A year later he was first picked for England. </p> <p> <strong> The import</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Massimo Taibi (Manchester Utd) </strong><br>Estimated earnings \u00a31m </p> <p>Taibi's move to Old Trafford represents what can go wrong with big money transfers. He joined United for \u00a34.4m, but his reign as first choice keeper was short-lived after blunders in matches against Chelsea and Southampton, including letting a ball slip through his legs into the net. He was allowed to return to Italy on loan to Serie A team Reggina. </p> <p>The huge sums involved highlight how much cash some of the top clubs have to spend, but also shows that spending such sums does not guarantee success. </p> <p>Undeterred, Manchester United have now spent \u00a310m on Fabien Barthez to plug a hole in their defence. </p> <p> <strong> The chairman</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Peter Boizot (Peterborough Utd)</strong> <br>Football earnings Nil</p> <p>After making a \u00a340m fortune from the Pizza Express chain, Mr Boizot took control of his home town club Peterborough United four years ago and last season the team won promotion to Division Two for the first time in six seasons. </p> <p>It is Boizot's large pockets, not the trickle down of the Premiership's riches, that keeps the club in business. </p> <p>Despite having the best attendences in Division Three last season and the fact that all its players earn less than \u00a31,000 a week each, the club runs at an estimated loss of \u00a320,000 a week and had to sell two of its best young players last season. Boizot hopes Peterborough's football academy will turn his club into \"the Manchester United of East Anglia\". </p> <p> <strong> The fan</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Ed Saunders, 33 </strong><br>Football earnings Nil </p> <p>Dedicated football fans are, if Manchester United's board is to be believed, the people who pay the players wages, yet their influence on the development of the game is minor. </p> <p>Mr Saunders, a QPR fan from London, believes that the English players' lack of technical ability, the number of foreign players and a paucity of resources for non-Premiership clubs are hampering the British game. </p> <p>\"The difference between the Premiership and the other leagues is vast. If you don't have the money then it's very difficult to improve,\" he said. </p> <p> <strong> The failure</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Chris Sutton (Chelsea) </strong><br>Estimated earnings \u00a31.25m</p> <p>A season of failure with his club and a probable transfer at a reduced fee is unlikely to damage Sutton's earning power. </p> <p>Last summer he moved from relegated Blackburn Rovers to Chelsea for \u00a310m, hoping that success there would get him back in contention for an England place. </p> <p>Instead this summer Sutton, 26, is being linked to a \u00a36m move to Middlesbrough or Celtic after failing to impress at Stamford Bridge. In a side packed with continental stars with greater technical prowess, he struggled to score goals, getting one in the premiership. His manager had expected 20. </p> <p>This summer's arrival of the Dutch striker Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink for \u00a315m left Sutton surplus to requirements. </p> <p> <strong> The hopeful</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Jon Harley (Chelsea) </strong> <br> Earns \u00a3250 a week </p> <p>Started as an apprentice at Chelsea and broke into the first squad in April 1998. His spell in the first team was short-lived, however, some would say due to the influx of the \"foreign legion\". But it is a claim he is quick to dismiss. </p> <p>\"If you're good enough you will get your chance,\" he said. \"It just shows that, if young players are ready, they will come through.\" </p> <p>He said that the quality of the imports was beneficial to everyone at the club. \"It might be an issue if they were buying players who aren't that great and were blocking English players just as good.\" </p> <p>The 20-year-old has signed a new three-and-a-half year deal and got back into the first team last season with a run in Chelsea's FA Cup squad. </p> <p> <strong> The coach</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong>John Robinson, 31 </strong><br> Coaches kids voluntarily <br> Football earnings: Nil</p> <p>Football coaches, whether they run a local youth team, or simply help develop children's skills, are at the bottom of the football funding food chain. </p> <p>\"It's important to improve skills, but there's not the funding available,\" said Mr Robinson, of Coventry. \"The money that is around goes no further than the football clubs because the FA is trying to put money into academies.

The failure Chris Sutton (Chelsea) Estimated earnings \u00a31.25m A season of failure with his club and a probable transfer at a reduced fee is unlikely to damage Sutton's earning power. Last summer he moved from relegated Blackburn Rovers to Chelsea for \u00a310m, hoping that success there would get him back in contention for an England place. Instead this summer Sutton, 26, is being linked to a \u00a36m move to Middlesbrough or Celtic after failing to impress at Stamford Bridge. In a side packed with continental stars with greater technical prowess, he struggled to score goals, getting one in the premiership. His manager had expected 20. This summer's arrival of the Dutch striker Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink for \u00a315m left Sutton surplus to requirements. The hopeful Jon Harley (Chelsea) Earns \u00a3250 a week Started as an apprentice at Chelsea and broke into the first squad in April 1998. His spell in the first team was short-lived, however, some would say due to the influx of the \"foreign legion\". But it is a claim he is quick to dismiss. \"If you're good enough you will get your chance,\" he said. \"It just shows that, if young players are ready, they will come through.\" He said that the quality of the imports was beneficial to everyone at the club. \"It might be an issue if they were buying players who aren't that great and were blocking English players just as good.\" The 20-year-old has signed a new three-and-a-half year deal and got back into the first team last season with a run in Chelsea's FA Cup squad. The coach John Robinson, 31 Coaches kids voluntarily Football earnings: Nil Football coaches, whether they run a local youth team, or simply help develop children's skills, are at the bottom of the football funding food chain. \"It's important to improve skills, but there's not the funding available,\" said Mr Robinson, of Coventry. \"The money that is around goes no further than the football clubs because the FA is trying to put money into academies. Children's teams don't really get any funding.\" Useful links Euro 2000 Official site Football Unlimited Football Association National Criminal Intelligence Service Football violence: special report",

      "body": "<p>When 42 The Calls, the chic hotel located in three converted corn and flower mills overlooking the old waterfront area on the edge of Leeds city centre, was voted business hotel of the year in 1998, Ajaz Ahmed was working as store manager in the local PC World. </p> <p>It was his 16th year with the Dixons group and having spent most of that time in the Huddersfield branch of Britain's largest electrical goods retailer, the move into Leeds and the new responsibility it brought with it was a welcome opportunity. However, it was unlikely to bring the 34 -year-old into contact with the local suits who regularly flexed their expense accounts on lunches at the smart brasserie inside 42 The Calls. </p> <p>Two years on and Mr Ahmed can eat just about anywhere he wants. As business development director of Freeserve, one of the FTSE 100's highest profile companies, he has joined the upper echelons of the Yorkshire business community. His loftspace office overlooks 42 The Calls and if he wants to pop across the road for a quick lunch they are hardly likely to refuse him a table. </p> <p>A large part of the Leeds economy depends on the internet and technology and Mr Ahmed is one of its leading lights. \"Leeds is becoming an internet capital and I think that surprises a lot of people,\" Mr Ahmed says. \"People assume Manchester or Birmingham are likely to be the hot spots outside London but they're not. It's us - 30% of all UK internet traffic is routed through this city. It's a town on the move.\" </p> <p>Much of the dot.com momentum has come from Freeserve. Britain's largest internet service provider was founded in Leeds in late 1998. There is some dispute over who came up with the original concept but the story goes something like this: Mr Ahmed, a humble store manager, buys a PC for home but finds that neither he nor anyone who works in his branch is able to access this new thing called the internet. </p> <p><strong>Banging on doors</strong><br> </p> <p>Realising that most consumers face the same problem and that the majority of Britain's PCs are sold through the Dixons group, he thinks the chain has an unrivalled chance to become a leading internet player by pre-loading net access on to its computers. Armed with his idea he goes banging on doors at head office only to be dismissed by everyone except corporate development executives John Pluthero and Mark Danby. </p> <p>Together they work on a concept but cannot make it work until Peter Wilkinson, founder of local internet services company Planet Online, devises a way to offer the service to customers for free, not have to worry about collecting subscriptions and rely on a share of the resulting telephone call charges to generate revenue. </p> <p>Freeserve was born and the rest, as they say, is history. Today Freeserve's corporate head office is based in the Dixons main office in Hemel Hempstead, Berkshire and Mr Pluthero is its chief executive. But the company's heart still beats from Leeds. A team of 35 designers, producers, engineers and business development staff operate out of a converted warehouse by the docks striking the content deals and building the portal. </p> <p>Heavily incentivised through equity they spend much of the day checking their online share portfolios to see how the latest takeover speculation is affecting Freeserve's share price. \"The success of companies like Freeserve and Planet [now a key subsidiary of telecoms group Energis] has acted as a catalyst to others,\" says Mr Ahmed, relaxing in an armchair in an open plan office complete with CD rack and inflatable basketball hoop. </p> <p>\"Leeds has always been a very service orientated town full of banks, building societies and call centres. The transport is good as well. I can jump on the train and be in London for a meeting inside 2 hours.\" </p> <p>The strength of the local service industry sector and the city's history of innovation - First Direct set the telephone banking revolution rolling from Leeds - has encouraged several hi-tech firms to open offices in the area. More than 10,000 people now work in the Leeds new media industry for companies including Teamtalk, the Press Association, Totalise and Sports.com, according to local e-business consultancy Evaxyx. A further 15,000 people work in call centres for companies like Direct Line, First Direct and BT Cellnet. </p> <p>The city is now Britain's third largest manufacturing centre and third largest financial centre. In education terms Leeds is second only to London with 45,000 students studying at local institutions. </p> <p>Citria, which is a London-based e-business solutions company, said it was that skills base which encouraged it to choose Leeds over Birmingham, Liverpool and Manchester when it recently opened its first regional office. \"Building e-business isn't possible without the right people and we will move wherever the talent is,\" said chief executive Chris Potts. </p> <p>The emergence of the likes of Freeserve and Planet has been a huge relief to locally based professional advisers. \"A few years ago businesses were being taken private and we were talking about the death of the PA in Leeds,\" said Phil Evans, partner at Arthur Anderson. \"Now there are several new businesses looking to float. The focus of our work has changed dramatically as a result.\" </p> <p>Local development agencies have been keen to replicate the success Leeds has enjoyed in attracting new economy companies in other areas of Yorkshire and the Humber region in need of regeneration. The subsequent emergence of several new firms has led some locals to dub the region Silicon Dale. </p> <p><strong> Fantastic work force</strong><br> </p> <p>Steel and coalworks used to belch out fumes across the countryside surrounding Manvers, on the edge of Wath-upon-Dearne in south Yorkshire. Today the heavy industry is largely gone, replaced by acres and acres of call-centres, car parks and cavernous warehouses. EuroTelecom Communications, an AIM listed firm that specialises in building and managing fully networked buildings for hi-tech firms, moved on to the site six weeks ago. \"The whole area is buzzing,\" says chief executive Phil Derry. \"The workforce resource here is fantastic, the infrastructure links are excellent and costs are lower than down south.\" </p> <p>Further north in Harrogate is the home of Sports Internet, recently bought by BSkyB for \u00a3300m. Across in York several biotech and computer companies are conducting pioneering research in the city science park. Sheffield, the steel city, is also catching up and recently spawned Kazoo 3D, a computer graphics firm which listed on AIM less than a year after starting up. </p> <p>Nick Pascoe, an entrepreneur who runs the northern branch of networking group First Tuesday, says: \"The northern business climate comes from manufacturing and is still a bit dour and cynical in places. The old boy network and the grey hairs are still a bit impenetrable, but you only have to walk through Leeds to see how it is changing and becoming more vibrant. That can only be a good thing.\"</p>",

Two years on and Mr Ahmed can eat just about anywhere he wants. As business development director of Freeserve, one of the FTSE 100's highest profile companies, he has joined the upper echelons of the Yorkshire business community. His loftspace office overlooks 42 The Calls and if he wants to pop across the road for a quick lunch they are hardly likely to refuse him a table. A large part of the Leeds economy depends on the internet and technology and Mr Ahmed is one of its leading lights. \"Leeds is becoming an internet capital and I think that surprises a lot of people,\" Mr Ahmed says. \"People assume Manchester or Birmingham are likely to be the hot spots outside London but they're not. It's us - 30% of all UK internet traffic is routed through this city. It's a town on the move.\" Much of the dot.com momentum has come from Freeserve. Britain's largest internet service provider was founded in Leeds in late 1998. There is some dispute over who came up with the original concept but the story goes something like this: Mr Ahmed, a humble store manager, buys a PC for home but finds that neither he nor anyone who works in his branch is able to access this new thing called the internet. Banging on doors Realising that most consumers face the same problem and that the majority of Britain's PCs are sold through the Dixons group, he thinks the chain has an unrivalled chance to become a leading internet player by pre-loading net access on to its computers. Armed with his idea he goes banging on doors at head office only to be dismissed by everyone except corporate development executives John Pluthero and Mark Danby. Together they work on a concept but cannot make it work until Peter Wilkinson, founder of local internet services company Planet Online, devises a way to offer the service to customers for free, not have to worry about collecting subscriptions and rely on a share of the resulting telephone call charges to generate revenue. Freeserve was born and the rest, as they say, is history. Today Freeserve's corporate head office is based in the Dixons main office in Hemel Hempstead, Berkshire and Mr Pluthero is its chief executive. But the company's heart still beats from Leeds. A team of 35 designers, producers, engineers and business development staff operate out of a converted warehouse by the docks striking the content deals and building the portal. Heavily incentivised through equity they spend much of the day checking their online share portfolios to see how the latest takeover speculation is affecting Freeserve's share price. \"The success of companies like Freeserve and Planet [now a key subsidiary of telecoms group Energis] has acted as a catalyst to others,\" says Mr Ahmed, relaxing in an armchair in an open plan office complete with CD rack and inflatable basketball hoop. \"Leeds has always been a very service orientated town full of banks, building societies and call centres. The transport is good as well. I can jump on the train and be in London for a meeting inside 2 hours.\" The strength of the local service industry sector and the city's history of innovation - First Direct set the telephone banking revolution rolling from Leeds - has encouraged several hi-tech firms to open offices in the area. More than 10,000 people now work in the Leeds new media industry for companies including Teamtalk, the Press Association, Totalise and Sports.com, according to local e-business consultancy Evaxyx. A further 15,000 people work in call centres for companies like Direct Line, First Direct and BT Cellnet. The city is now Britain's third largest manufacturing centre and third largest financial centre. In education terms Leeds is second only to London with 45,000 students studying at local institutions. Citria, which is a London-based e-business solutions company, said it was that skills base which encouraged it to choose Leeds over Birmingham, Liverpool and Manchester when it recently opened its first regional office. \"Building e-business isn't possible without the right people and we will move wherever the talent is,\" said chief executive Chris Potts. The emergence of the likes of Freeserve and Planet has been a huge relief to locally based professional advisers. \"A few years ago businesses were being taken private and we were talking about the death of the PA in Leeds,\" said Phil Evans, partner at Arthur Anderson. \"Now there are several new businesses looking to float. The focus of our work has changed dramatically as a result.\" Local development agencies have been keen to replicate the success Leeds has enjoyed in attracting new economy companies in other areas of Yorkshire and the Humber region in need of regeneration. The subsequent emergence of several new firms has led some locals to dub the region Silicon Dale. Fantastic work force Steel and coalworks used to belch out fumes across the countryside surrounding Manvers, on the edge of Wath-upon-Dearne in south Yorkshire. Today the heavy industry is largely gone, replaced by acres and acres of call-centres, car parks and cavernous warehouses. EuroTelecom Communications, an AIM listed firm that specialises in building and managing fully networked buildings for hi-tech firms, moved on to the site six weeks ago. \"The whole area is buzzing,\" says chief executive Phil Derry. \"The workforce resource here is fantastic, the infrastructure links are excellent and costs are lower than down south.\" Further north in Harrogate is the home of Sports Internet, recently bought by BSkyB for \u00a3300m. Across in York several biotech and computer companies are conducting pioneering research in the city science park. Sheffield, the steel city, is also catching up and recently spawned Kazoo 3D, a computer graphics firm which listed on AIM less than a year after starting up. Nick Pascoe, an entrepreneur who runs the northern branch of networking group First Tuesday, says: \"The northern business climate comes from manufacturing and is still a bit dour and cynical in places. The old boy network and the grey hairs are still a bit impenetrable, but you only have to walk through Leeds to see how it is changing and becoming more vibrant. That can only be a good thing.\"",

Winning that affection back is vital to the future success of the whole BBC,\" the governors said. </p> <p>One of Mr Salmon's triumphs at the BBC has been his promotion of the new genre of popular factual programming: docusoaps such as Driving School, Hotel and Airport; and consumer shows such as Changing Rooms have proved huge hits with viewers. </p> <p>But the governors have detected the sound of dead horses being flogged around White City: the early evening schedules rely too heavily on light factual shows at the ex pense of drama, comedy and serious factual programmes, they said. And sensitive to the argument of cultural snobbishness, they were at pains to point out that it was not that the BBC was too populist, but that the programmes were not \"truly distinctive\" enough to serve viewers. </p> <p>This is a recurring problem for the BBC. Does public service broadcasting mean that it should provide programmes that others do not? Or does it have a responsibility to compete in the market with its commercial rivals? Clearly, the answer is both, and the BBC at the moment is failing to get the balance right. </p> <p>Greg Dyke, BBC director general, announced an extra \u00a315m for BBC1 and BBC2 for this financial year, but recently Mr Salmon said that he needed \u00a3100m more and his counterpart at BBC2, Jane Root, pitched for \u00a350m. </p> <p>Yet while the governors put down BBC1's failures \"substantially\" to lack of cash, it is not as if the BBC is short of money. The latest licence fee settlement has turned it into a \u00a33bn organisation. Money is not the key to making programmes: imagination and ambition are, say programme makers. </p> <p>Yet it would be unfair to paint the governors' report as a doom-laden document. The BBC's chairman Sir Christopher Bland said the corporation could be proud of its performance during a tough year: the \"distinctiveness, ambition and range\" of programmes and services had been maintained \"during a year of unprecedented challenge\" to the organisation. </p> <p>The BBC's discomfort over its governors' criticisms of BBC1 were deepened when details leaked on the internet of its \"secret\" autumn schedule. </p> <p>Plans for a variety of new shows and returning favourites - kept confidential to prevent rivals from stealing a march - were revealed on the news website annanova.com. </p> <p>This showed that the BBC has convinced the writer of the hit comedy One Foot in the Grave to pen a new series, and that the corporation has lined up the historian Simon Schama to front a 16-part series, History 2000: the History of Britain, costing \u00a36m. </p> <p>It is hoped that the series, an ambitious project to document the nation's history, will become a \"landmark\" programme of the type recently advocated by the culture secretary, Chris Smith. It will also please the BBC's governors, who are determined to see the corporation make more high quality programmes. </p> <p>Equally, persuading David Renwick to write a new series of the show, starring Richard Wilson as the crotchety Victor Mel drew, is being seen as a coup. \"We are thrilled that Victor is back. The character is a legend,\" said a BBC comedy source quoted by the website. </p> <p>Among other highlights for the new season is a \u00a33m production of Love in a Cold Climate, Nancy Mitford's comedy of manners. It has been adapted by Deborah Moggach, and follows the fortunes of three upper class girls who dedicate their lives to the pursuit of love. </p> <p>Filming is already under way, with a cast including Celia Imrie, Frances Barber and Alan Bates. </p> <p>The three heroines are played by newcomers Elizabeth Dermot Walsh, Rosamund Pike and Megan Dodds. </p> <p>Drama favorites also figure in the new schedule: Casualty, Holby City, Silent Witness and The Scarlet Pimpernel. </p> <p>There is new comedy with the Rab C Nesbitt star Gregor Fisher; Caroline Aherne returns in the Royle Family. The creator of Common as Muck has written a new comedy drama, The Sins, in which Pete Postlethwaite plays an ex-con struggling with life on the outside.</p>",

This is a recurring problem for the BBC. Does public service broadcasting mean that it should provide programmes that others do not? Or does it have a responsibility to compete in the market with its commercial rivals? Clearly, the answer is both, and the BBC at the moment is failing to get the balance right. Greg Dyke, BBC director general, announced an extra \u00a315m for BBC1 and BBC2 for this financial year, but recently Mr Salmon said that he needed \u00a3100m more and his counterpart at BBC2, Jane Root, pitched for \u00a350m. Yet while the governors put down BBC1's failures \"substantially\" to lack of cash, it is not as if the BBC is short of money. The latest licence fee settlement has turned it into a \u00a33bn organisation. Money is not the key to making programmes: imagination and ambition are, say programme makers. Yet it would be unfair to paint the governors' report as a doom-laden document. The BBC's chairman Sir Christopher Bland said the corporation could be proud of its performance during a tough year: the \"distinctiveness, ambition and range\" of programmes and services had been maintained \"during a year of unprecedented challenge\" to the organisation. The BBC's discomfort over its governors' criticisms of BBC1 were deepened when details leaked on the internet of its \"secret\" autumn schedule. Plans for a variety of new shows and returning favourites - kept confidential to prevent rivals from stealing a march - were revealed on the news website annanova.com. This showed that the BBC has convinced the writer of the hit comedy One Foot in the Grave to pen a new series, and that the corporation has lined up the historian Simon Schama to front a 16-part series, History 2000: the History of Britain, costing \u00a36m. It is hoped that the series, an ambitious project to document the nation's history, will become a \"landmark\" programme of the type recently advocated by the culture secretary, Chris Smith. It will also please the BBC's governors, who are determined to see the corporation make more high quality programmes. Equally, persuading David Renwick to write a new series of the show, starring Richard Wilson as the crotchety Victor Mel drew, is being seen as a coup. \"We are thrilled that Victor is back. The character is a legend,\" said a BBC comedy source quoted by the website. Among other highlights for the new season is a \u00a33m production of Love in a Cold Climate, Nancy Mitford's comedy of manners. It has been adapted by Deborah Moggach, and follows the fortunes of three upper class girls who dedicate their lives to the pursuit of love. Filming is already under way, with a cast including Celia Imrie, Frances Barber and Alan Bates. The three heroines are played by newcomers Elizabeth Dermot Walsh, Rosamund Pike and Megan Dodds. Drama favorites also figure in the new schedule: Casualty, Holby City, Silent Witness and The Scarlet Pimpernel. There is new comedy with the Rab C Nesbitt star Gregor Fisher; Caroline Aherne returns in the Royle Family. The creator of Common as Muck has written a new comedy drama, The Sins, in which Pete Postlethwaite plays an ex-con struggling with life on the outside.",

      "bodyText": "The spiralling costs needed to protect Her Majesty's wardrobe from collapsing through the floor of Buckingham Palace are revealed today in an official report. It reveals that the Queen, like many of her subjects, suffers the same problems with builders - asked to do one job, they do three and the bill goes through the roof. The original proposal was a simple one. Design and build wall-to-wall wardrobes in three rooms in the palace to hang up the Queen's outfits and official robes. But the carpenters called in had to abandon the work after they discovered that the floor would collapse if they went ahead. No sooner had this been put right than electricians had to be employed to rewire the rooms. Security experts were then also summoned to ensure that nobody was able to steal any of the costumes. The cost of providing the new wardrobes escalated from an original figure of \u00a351,000 to a final \u00a370,000, with \u00a39,000 spent on redesigning them to new standards. The 37% cost overrun is the highest quoted in a national audit office report published today. The report is the first in which auditors from parliament's financial watchdog have been given access to the royal accounts. The report into some \u00a37.2m spent on building work at Buckingham Palace, St James' Palace, Clarence House, Kensington Palace and Windsor Castle actually concludes that too little may be being spent by the taxpayer on the maintenance of the royal family's official residences. Maintenance costs have been reduced from \u00a319m a year in 1991 to \u00a37.2m last year. The report reveals that altogether some \u00a387,000 has been spent on double glazing windows and installing long-life lightbulbs in the royal palaces and some \u00a31.67m has been spent on health and safety measures. These included large rewiring jobs and fire measures after the fire that burnt down parts of Windsor Castle. Another \u00a33.1m was spent on re-roofing buildings and resurfacing roads. Staff in the palace have also had new and refurbished offices as part of a \u00a31.3m modernisation programme. The report also praises the royal household for cutting overall costs to the taxpayer form \u00a329m a year to \u00a315.8m a year between 1992 and 1999. It also points out that visitor charges at Windsor Castle and Buckingham Palace have brought in \u00a325.9m which has been spent on renovating the fire damaged at Windsor Castle without having to charge the taxpayer more money.",

      "bodyText": "Labour MPs are accusing the cabinet minister heading moves to modernise the Commons of pandering to the Conservatives rather than backing Labour backbenchers over the need to speed up the pace of reform. One Labour member of the modernisation committee denounced the leader of the Commons, Margaret Beckett, as an \"absolute disgrace\", after a report setting out agreed reforms, including an end to voting in the early hours of the morning on key issues, was not finally agreed as expected yesterday. MPs who are backing change have learned that the Commons will now not have the chance to vote on the modernisation measures until the autumn. This will be during the \"spillover period\" after the summer recess. A vote had been expected before the break, allowing a special order to permit planned reform of timetabling to be passed before the end of the parliamentary session in October. The order will now not be passed until after the start of the new session, delaying the implementation of change. Labour members on the committee have argued for changes to voting times and for improved timetabling of legislation, in the face of strong opposition from some Conservative members. The plans would mean that no key votes will take place after 10pm, with votes falling after that time being taken during a designated period the following day. The plans would also give the government powers to set out a fixed time for a bill's passage through the Commons, while allowing the opposition to decide how much time was allocated to each clause, in order to permit the challenging of ministers on controversial elements. The committee has agreed the changes, but a report confirming them is now not due to be agreed for a further fortnight, after Ms Beckett once more permitted delays. Two Labour members of the committee are understood to be considering stepping down after progress stalled again. One MP said: \"This is a delay too far. \"There is pressure from Labour members and those outside the Commons for far more radical change, but we have kept our MPs on board by reassuring them the report was imminent. \"But Margaret is listening more to the Tories than her own backbenchers. We have been taken for a ride - we are lecturing business about efficiency and effectiveness, and yet it has taken us four months to get an agreed report out.\" Many Labour MPs will not be satisfied with the committee's proposals in any case.

Members threw out proposals for a smaller, cut price chamber favoured by the first secretary, Rhodri Morgan, and the assembly cabinet. Opponents - some of whom derided the cabinet plan as a \"lean-to conservatory\" and a \"\u00a320m bog on stilts\" - claimed the scaled down project was a face saving ploy to allow Mr Morgan to distance himself from the grander, Richard Rogers designed glass building that is thought to be unpopular with sections of the electorate.

He subsequently asked Lord Rogers to examine the idea of building a smaller extension in the assembly car park. The decision to recommend a project that Lord Rogers had warned would not represent value for money was felt by some in the assembly to have been damaging to Mr Morgan's credibility. In a free vote 12 members of the Labour group voted against the cabinet option. The Conservative group, which has previously called for the money to spent on a children's hospital, voted against the idea of a new building.

For supporting Zimbabwe's opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), he suffered unspeakable torture and his brother Finos was beaten to death.</p> <p>\"I thought I had the right to support any party of my choice,\" the visibly terrified Mr Zhou said in his hospital bed. \"But now I think these politics are dirty. It's not good.\"</p> <p>Violence and torture are rampant throughout rural Zimbabwe before the crucial parliamentary elections this weekend. Teachers, doctors and nurses have been picked on. More than 13,000 rural people have fled to the relative safety of the cities, according to the Human Rights Forum.</p> <p>Confronted by swelling support for the MDC, President Robert Mugabe's government is also using new voting regulations and restrictions on observers in a frantic attempt to reduce the size of the opposition vote.</p> <p>These aspects of intimidation are evident in Mataga, 250 miles south-east of Harare.</p> <p>The Zhou brothers were abducted from their home near Mataga on June 4 by 18 supporters of President Mugabe's Zanu-PF party. They were taken to Texas Farm, where they were beaten and burned for more than 24 hours.</p> <p>The violence was prompted by the fact that Finos had signed nomination papers for the local MDC candidate for parliament.</p> <p>Finos died of internal injuries on June 6. James will need extensive skin grafts and reconstructive surgery to restore his backside.</p> <p>Despite numerous identifications, the police have not arrested anyone for the Zhous' murder and torture. They have not gone to Texas Farm which, war veterans and other Zanu-PF supporters have taken over for use as a torture centre.</p> <p>The Zhou brothers' horrific story is depressingly familiar in Mataga. Another man was wrapped in plastic bags which were set alight.</p> <p>More than 150 cases of assault, rape, genital mutilation and other torture of opposition supporters have been recorded, yet the police have taken virtually no action.</p> <p>At first glance the town appeared normal to three visiting journalists, with people going to the shops along the main street. But just minutes after we got out of our car at the post office we were surrounded by about a dozen youths, some wearing Zanu-PF T-shirts.</p> <p>They questioned us and ordered us to stay where we were. We decided to move on.

      "bodyText": "James Zhou has two gaping wounds where his buttocks used to be. For supporting Zimbabwe's opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), he suffered unspeakable torture and his brother Finos was beaten to death. \"I thought I had the right to support any party of my choice,\" the visibly terrified Mr Zhou said in his hospital bed. \"But now I think these politics are dirty. It's not good.\" Violence and torture are rampant throughout rural Zimbabwe before the crucial parliamentary elections this weekend. Teachers, doctors and nurses have been picked on. More than 13,000 rural people have fled to the relative safety of the cities, according to the Human Rights Forum. Confronted by swelling support for the MDC, President Robert Mugabe's government is also using new voting regulations and restrictions on observers in a frantic attempt to reduce the size of the opposition vote. These aspects of intimidation are evident in Mataga, 250 miles south-east of Harare. The Zhou brothers were abducted from their home near Mataga on June 4 by 18 supporters of President Mugabe's Zanu-PF party. They were taken to Texas Farm, where they were beaten and burned for more than 24 hours. The violence was prompted by the fact that Finos had signed nomination papers for the local MDC candidate for parliament. Finos died of internal injuries on June 6. James will need extensive skin grafts and reconstructive surgery to restore his backside. Despite numerous identifications, the police have not arrested anyone for the Zhous' murder and torture. They have not gone to Texas Farm which, war veterans and other Zanu-PF supporters have taken over for use as a torture centre. The Zhou brothers' horrific story is depressingly familiar in Mataga. Another man was wrapped in plastic bags which were set alight. More than 150 cases of assault, rape, genital mutilation and other torture of opposition supporters have been recorded, yet the police have taken virtually no action. At first glance the town appeared normal to three visiting journalists, with people going to the shops along the main street. But just minutes after we got out of our car at the post office we were surrounded by about a dozen youths, some wearing Zanu-PF T-shirts. They questioned us and ordered us to stay where we were. We decided to move on. We went to some shops owned by opposition supporters which had been vandalised and burned by Zanu-PF. A truck roared by filled with young men waving iron bars, clubs and machetes. They shouted and jeered at us. One pointed at us and pulled his machete across his throat as if to slit ours. The people at the shops were obviously frightened and would not speak to us. At the Mataga police station the officer in charge assured us that the situation was calm and normal and that opposition parties were free to campaign. He admitted that the MDC offices had been burned down and he knew of no MDC people we could meet. A few minutes later we found the officer laughing with the leader of the gang that had surrounded us. They were clearly in league with each other. It was getting dark so we decided to leave. The truck with youths waving crowbars and clubs followed us to the edge of town. We came to a crossroads and stopped to decide way to go. A man leaned into the car and demanded to see our Zanu-PF cards and to search our vehicle. We said he was not a policeman and he had no right to demand anything. He shouted and eight men approached our car. We sped off and they threw stones at the car. We came to another group setting up an illegal roadblock and drove right through it. Once again stones were thrown at us. The intimidation we encountered was minor, and it was clear that if we had been local Zimbabweans much more serious assaults could have occurred. But Mataga is not all menace and fear. It is also full of heroic resistance. The MDC candidate for the Mataga area is a courageous woman called Sekai Holland. She was held by the Mataga police without charges for two nights and then taken away to the nearest city, Zvishavane. She has not been able to return to Mataga because of the roadblocks. Her car was burned and more than Z$85,000 (\u00a31,460) was stolen from her by Zanu-PF supporters. \"They are terrorising our area,\" said Lewellin Sibanda. \"But we go back to campaign at night and to put up posters.

The independent television commission, which has criticised the network for the loss of 1m viewers since the news schedule changes last year, is meeting to discuss a final set of proposals by ITV to bolster the ratings of ITN bulletins. It is understood the regulator wants ITV to bring forward its 11pm news to 10.30 but, in their proposals to the committee today, ITV chiefs are refusing to back down. Chief executives of the three main ITV companies - Granada, Carlton and United - have told the network head, David Liddiment, they are prepared to go to court rather than give in. The commission has the power to force a judicial review, but ITV believes the regulator does not have the nerve to go through with a highly damaging court action. It was the commission, ITV sources say, that gave permission for the schedule change more than a year ago, and they believe it has moved the goalposts in introducing ratings as a criteria by which to judge the performance of the bulletins. \"They know that all our legal advice shows that they don't have the power to regulate for ratings,\" an ITV source said. \"This is such a parochial debate - you can't stop the march of digital television and 24-hour news channels.\" In the compromise package, ITV would bring back News at Ten for election campaigns, and extend the problematic 11pm news by five minutes.

At the end of the 90s, Scotland was spending 7% more per head than it needed.

Especially the north-east. Here is an area which has suffered all the torments of de-industrialisation experienced by west-central Scotland, where poverty is rife and the health record is none too good. In 1997 GDP per head in the north-east was some 13% below Scotland's. But government spending is less than in Scotland, on a per capita basis nearly 20% less. Take death (standardised mortality rate) as an index of ill health. Scotland's is 5% higher than the north-east's. That justifies higher health spending. Scotland, however, spends 23% more per head on health than the north-east. The chart captures other areas in which Scotland does better - in Glasgow pupil-teacher ratios are about a fifth lower than in Middlesbrough. The differences do not stop there. Locate in Scotland has just secured a record number of jobs while a new academic study of business networks shows the competitiveness of the north-east (along with Yorkshire and the Midlands) is falling relative to other parts of England. Yet spending on trade and industry is again less in the north-east.</p> <p>Such figures will remain of academic interest unless they become the subject of political mobilisation. Unless, in other words, there is a \"Geordie rebellion\" similar to that in the late 70s, differences will not be addressed.

      "body": "<p>Jo Evans has not seen her ex-headmaster's study for almost a quarter of a century, but she can remember it as clearly as if she had been summoned there this morning. It's the smell that comes back most vividly - leather, and the sharp scent of polish rising from Mr Peverett's mahogany table. She remembers the slip-on shoes he wore and his perma-crease trousers. And she remembers how he routinely sexually abused her there. Day after day. Again and again.</p> <p>She was 10 years old when the abuse began. She was shy and quiet, and in the academic shadow of her three elder siblings who were also at the school. Mr Peverett (she still uses the polite title like a schoolgirl responding to the class register) called her to his study after she had a poor report and told her she needed some extra tuition. The abuse began gradually - taking her out of class perhaps once a month for some one-to-one tuition in his office. Then he began to summon her daily.</p> <p>\"Pervert Peverett\" as he was known by his pupils (he was always twanging girls' bra straps and knicker elastic) chose victims who were pretty, physically well developed and easily intimidated. Each time Evans was called to his study, she knew exactly what to expect. She never came out of that room without being abused.</p> <p>The more he abused her, the worse her work became and the more reason he had to summon her for \"extra coaching\". She couldn't talk to anyone, least of all her parents, who were friends with the headmaster. She was not even safe at the weekend. Peverett told her parents she needed extra coaching on a Saturday, so she was taken to her abuser kicking and screaming and begging not to go.</p> <p>She felt frightened, powerless, and utterly under his control. If he had told her to walk on hot coals she would have done it. And her life has never been quite her own since.</p> <p>It was not until years later that Evans, now 35 with three children of her own, learned she was not Peverett's only victim. An unknown number of children who were in his care were abused by him in the same way. They were called to his office for so-called punishments. They were made to lie across his knee either naked or with their clothes and underwear pulled down and he would rub their bare buttocks in a circular motion and spank them.</p> <p>The consequences of his actions will last a lifetime for Evans and others like her. Yet on June 8, Robin Peverett OBE, former adviser to the Thatcher government, Ofsted inspector and headmaster of Dulwich College preparatory school, in Cranbrook, Kent, was sentenced to 18 months in prison suspended for two years. He admitted nine charges of indecently assaulting seven pupils - six girls and one boy - between the ages of 10 and 13, dating back to the late 60s and 70s, yet he walked free from court. The maximum sentence for indecent assault is 10 years. A further seven charges remain on the file.</p> <p>Peverett's case was originally listed for a three-week trial at Maidstone crown court - police and witnesses realised there would be considerable media interest, mainly because the Countess of Wessex, Sophie Rhys-Jones, was a pupil at the school, though she played no part in the police investigation. Peverett's victims were looking forward to their day in court. \"The trial was going to be our chance to say 'Hello. I'm back. I'm going to tell those 12 good men and women of the jury exactly what you did to me,' \" says Evans.</p> <p>In the end, after lengthy legal wrangling, the public hearing lasted less than an hour and a half and as a result of a bit of nifty plea-bargaining, Peverett, 66, pleaded guilty and got to go home that night. The headmaster's crimes were, Judge David Griffiths said, a serious breach of trust which would normally warrant custodial sentence, but because of Peverett's achievements in the field of education - there were glowing testimonies from former pupils, staff, parents, fellow heads and even one ex-cabinet minister - his was an exceptional case.</p> <p>So the former headmaster, who worked at the popular Dulwich Preparatory school for 30 years until his retirement in 1990, never had to face a jury and he never had to listen to his victims describe his crimes and the anguish they caused. Most of his accusers were not even in court to see him sentenced - Evans, by chance, was there expecting to be called as a witness. \"When I saw him in the court, for a split second I was back in his office. That's the power he had.\"</p> <p>As children they were betrayed by the man in whose care they had been placed; as adults they feel they have been cheated by the judicial system in which they put their faith. \"The sentence will be of great comfort to other headmasters, past and present, who assault children in their care,\" says another of Peverett's victims, Vicky Bennison, 41. \"On the other hand, victims of such abuse will be thinking, is all the emotional upheaval worth it if I go to the police and this is the result? They would conclude that it was not worth it and they would be right.\"</p> <p>Evans and Bennison, who were not identified in court, but have agreed to be named here, are now contacting the crown prosecution service (CPS) asking for the case to be referred to the attorney general, who could in turn refer it to the court of appeal to consider whether the sentence was unduly lenient. However, a CPS spokeswoman said there were no plans to refer the case on. The CPS view, it seems, is that at the time the offences were committed the maximum sentence was two years - taking that into consideration an 18-month suspended sentence does not seem unduly lenient, with the emphasis on unduly. Bennison and Evans, who have lived with the consequences of his actions for the best part of their lives, would disagree.</p> <p>It was Evans who sparked off the original investigation into Peverett, a father of three, after watching a Channel 5 programme about the marriage of Sophie Rhys-Jones to Prince Edward. \"Sophie was a good friend of mine. She was in my class. We had had contact up to her engagement. I watched it out of curiosity. Twenty minutes into the programme Mr Peverett came on to the screen. Seeing his face, I just lost the plot. I was inconsolable. I frightened myself. I started chucking things around the room. I frightened my husband. I couldn't believe he was still out there.\"</p> <p>She didn't eat or sleep for four days as she struggled to reach a decision about whether she should report him. She plucked up the courage and the inquiry began. \"Physically he did the same thing every single time. I got to expect that. It was humiliating and degrading. It was the mental abuse that shattered me at the time and has affected my life ever since. That's what they don't take into account in court.\"</p> <p>After Peverett's violations, her subsequent school career was unimpressive; she was deeply distrustful of male teachers and men in authority, worried that one of them would pick up where Peverett had left off. She was introverted and had problems forming relationships; she is still obsessive about covering up her body and is terrified of passing her problems on to her children.</p> <p>\"I'm supposed to be a role model for my children, but there's this thing in my past which has distorted my view of being female. I'm very frightened of passing on my warped view to my two young daughters. It's not OK for him to be infecting them. The main thing I have looked for is some peace in my life. I have not had peace since he did this to me.\"</p> <p>Bennison, who was a weekly boarder at the school for her last four terms, was summoned to Peverett's office because he noticed she had started to use deodorant. \"He was able to pick up on anxieties of children. He had this thing that I did not wash properly. He would sidle up to me and say, 'Have you washed? I'm sure you haven't.' I had to be punished for this.</p> <p>\"He used to call me out of the dormitory after lights out. He made me take my clothes off and lie across his knees for not having washed properly. I had to be naked in front of this man at the age of 11.</p> <p>\"I did not tell anyone about it. I didn't have the language to tell anyone. I told a boyfriend at the age of 17 and he didn't respond so I thought maybe this isn't important. For the next 15 years I could tell people when I got drunk at parties, but I couldn't tell my family and friends.\"</p> <p>Then last year Bennison, who was working on an aid project in Russia, returned to visit her parents and discovered that Evans had made a statement to the police and an investigation was underway. She was one of 20 former pupils to contact the police following publicity about Peverett - not all of them were part of the final case. Peverett, of Battle, East Sussex, admitted the charge of indecent assault relating to Bennison; he admitted two of the three charges relating to Evans.</p> <p>It should have been the beginning of the road to recovery for Bennison and Evans. Instead they feel cheated. They feel their voices have not been heard and their tormentor has escaped proper justice. \"He should have had a custodial sentence. He was an OBE. Big deal. It doesn't mean he isn't guilty,\" says Evans. \"So he was an Ofsted inspector. Big deal. He admitted he was guilty of child abuse. Why didn't he go to prison?</p> <p>\"I would have been happy if he had lost his liberty for just a short period of time. So maybe, just maybe, he might have had time to look back on his life and think about what he has done to us.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Jo Evans has not seen her ex-headmaster's study for almost a quarter of a century, but she can remember it as clearly as if she had been summoned there this morning. It's the smell that comes back most vividly - leather, and the sharp scent of polish rising from Mr Peverett's mahogany table. She remembers the slip-on shoes he wore and his perma-crease trousers. And she remembers how he routinely sexually abused her there. Day after day. Again and again. She was 10 years old when the abuse began. She was shy and quiet, and in the academic shadow of her three elder siblings who were also at the school. Mr Peverett (she still uses the polite title like a schoolgirl responding to the class register) called her to his study after she had a poor report and told her she needed some extra tuition. The abuse began gradually - taking her out of class perhaps once a month for some one-to-one tuition in his office. Then he began to summon her daily. \"Pervert Peverett\" as he was known by his pupils (he was always twanging girls' bra straps and knicker elastic) chose victims who were pretty, physically well developed and easily intimidated. Each time Evans was called to his study, she knew exactly what to expect. She never came out of that room without being abused. The more he abused her, the worse her work became and the more reason he had to summon her for \"extra coaching\". She couldn't talk to anyone, least of all her parents, who were friends with the headmaster. She was not even safe at the weekend. Peverett told her parents she needed extra coaching on a Saturday, so she was taken to her abuser kicking and screaming and begging not to go. She felt frightened, powerless, and utterly under his control. If he had told her to walk on hot coals she would have done it. And her life has never been quite her own since. It was not until years later that Evans, now 35 with three children of her own, learned she was not Peverett's only victim. An unknown number of children who were in his care were abused by him in the same way. They were called to his office for so-called punishments. They were made to lie across his knee either naked or with their clothes and underwear pulled down and he would rub their bare buttocks in a circular motion and spank them. The consequences of his actions will last a lifetime for Evans and others like her. Yet on June 8, Robin Peverett OBE, former adviser to the Thatcher government, Ofsted inspector and headmaster of Dulwich College preparatory school, in Cranbrook, Kent, was sentenced to 18 months in prison suspended for two years. He admitted nine charges of indecently assaulting seven pupils - six girls and one boy - between the ages of 10 and 13, dating back to the late 60s and 70s, yet he walked free from court. The maximum sentence for indecent assault is 10 years. A further seven charges remain on the file. Peverett's case was originally listed for a three-week trial at Maidstone crown court - police and witnesses realised there would be considerable media interest, mainly because the Countess of Wessex, Sophie Rhys-Jones, was a pupil at the school, though she played no part in the police investigation. Peverett's victims were looking forward to their day in court. \"The trial was going to be our chance to say 'Hello. I'm back. I'm going to tell those 12 good men and women of the jury exactly what you did to me,' \" says Evans. In the end, after lengthy legal wrangling, the public hearing lasted less than an hour and a half and as a result of a bit of nifty plea-bargaining, Peverett, 66, pleaded guilty and got to go home that night. The headmaster's crimes were, Judge David Griffiths said, a serious breach of trust which would normally warrant custodial sentence, but because of Peverett's achievements in the field of education - there were glowing testimonies from former pupils, staff, parents, fellow heads and even one ex-cabinet minister - his was an exceptional case. So the former headmaster, who worked at the popular Dulwich Preparatory school for 30 years until his retirement in 1990, never had to face a jury and he never had to listen to his victims describe his crimes and the anguish they caused. Most of his accusers were not even in court to see him sentenced - Evans, by chance, was there expecting to be called as a witness. \"When I saw him in the court, for a split second I was back in his office. That's the power he had.\" As children they were betrayed by the man in whose care they had been placed; as adults they feel they have been cheated by the judicial system in which they put their faith. \"The sentence will be of great comfort to other headmasters, past and present, who assault children in their care,\" says another of Peverett's victims, Vicky Bennison, 41. \"On the other hand, victims of such abuse will be thinking, is all the emotional upheaval worth it if I go to the police and this is the result? They would conclude that it was not worth it and they would be right.\" Evans and Bennison, who were not identified in court, but have agreed to be named here, are now contacting the crown prosecution service (CPS) asking for the case to be referred to the attorney general, who could in turn refer it to the court of appeal to consider whether the sentence was unduly lenient. However, a CPS spokeswoman said there were no plans to refer the case on. The CPS view, it seems, is that at the time the offences were committed the maximum sentence was two years - taking that into consideration an 18-month suspended sentence does not seem unduly lenient, with the emphasis on unduly. Bennison and Evans, who have lived with the consequences of his actions for the best part of their lives, would disagree. It was Evans who sparked off the original investigation into Peverett, a father of three, after watching a Channel 5 programme about the marriage of Sophie Rhys-Jones to Prince Edward. \"Sophie was a good friend of mine. She was in my class. We had had contact up to her engagement. I watched it out of curiosity. Twenty minutes into the programme Mr Peverett came on to the screen. Seeing his face, I just lost the plot. I was inconsolable. I frightened myself. I started chucking things around the room. I frightened my husband. I couldn't believe he was still out there.\" She didn't eat or sleep for four days as she struggled to reach a decision about whether she should report him. She plucked up the courage and the inquiry began. \"Physically he did the same thing every single time. I got to expect that. It was humiliating and degrading. It was the mental abuse that shattered me at the time and has affected my life ever since. That's what they don't take into account in court.\" After Peverett's violations, her subsequent school career was unimpressive; she was deeply distrustful of male teachers and men in authority, worried that one of them would pick up where Peverett had left off. She was introverted and had problems forming relationships; she is still obsessive about covering up her body and is terrified of passing her problems on to her children. \"I'm supposed to be a role model for my children, but there's this thing in my past which has distorted my view of being female. I'm very frightened of passing on my warped view to my two young daughters. It's not OK for him to be infecting them. The main thing I have looked for is some peace in my life. I have not had peace since he did this to me.\" Bennison, who was a weekly boarder at the school for her last four terms, was summoned to Peverett's office because he noticed she had started to use deodorant. \"He was able to pick up on anxieties of children. He had this thing that I did not wash properly. He would sidle up to me and say, 'Have you washed? I'm sure you haven't.' I had to be punished for this. \"He used to call me out of the dormitory after lights out. He made me take my clothes off and lie across his knees for not having washed properly. I had to be naked in front of this man at the age of 11. \"I did not tell anyone about it. I didn't have the language to tell anyone. I told a boyfriend at the age of 17 and he didn't respond so I thought maybe this isn't important. For the next 15 years I could tell people when I got drunk at parties, but I couldn't tell my family and friends.\" Then last year Bennison, who was working on an aid project in Russia, returned to visit her parents and discovered that Evans had made a statement to the police and an investigation was underway. She was one of 20 former pupils to contact the police following publicity about Peverett - not all of them were part of the final case. Peverett, of Battle, East Sussex, admitted the charge of indecent assault relating to Bennison; he admitted two of the three charges relating to Evans. It should have been the beginning of the road to recovery for Bennison and Evans. Instead they feel cheated. They feel their voices have not been heard and their tormentor has escaped proper justice. \"He should have had a custodial sentence. He was an OBE. Big deal. It doesn't mean he isn't guilty,\" says Evans. \"So he was an Ofsted inspector. Big deal. He admitted he was guilty of child abuse. Why didn't he go to prison? \"I would have been happy if he had lost his liberty for just a short period of time. So maybe, just maybe, he might have had time to look back on his life and think about what he has done to us.\"",

We also do not believe that a merger between BA and KLM is in the interests of the consumer.\" The two men have agreed to arrange a cricket match between the two companies, the first for a decade. They emphasised that while there are business issues on which they will be on opposing sides, there is a need for a sensible working relationship.",

Ruskin dated his recognition of this beauty to his first vision of the Alps while travelling as a child with his parents. \"The seen walls of lost Eden could not have been more beautiful to us,\" he remembered.

      "body": "<p>Few singers can claim to have inspired not one but several of the great writers, philosophers and songwriters of the 20th century. Few can justly claim to have become international icons. Juliette Gr\u00e9co can. As muse to Sartre, Camus, Cocteau, Pr\u00e9vert, Serge Gainsbourg and Jacques Brel, and lover of jazz legend Miles Davis, Gr\u00e9co came to personify Paris's Left Bank chic. More than a singer, she came to embody rebellion, freedom and individualism. Both she and the songs she sang have become an integral part of French culture. </p> <p>From the late 40s, through the 50s and 60s, Gr\u00e9co's records were the sound on a thousand bedsit turntables, and her face adorned a thousand garret walls. She created the style of a generation, with her jet-black sweep of long, straight hair, short fringe, black eyeliner and ivory pallor. \"You moonbathe while others sunbathe,\" Picasso once told her. Black sweaters and pedal pushers completed the look, which became the paradigm of bohemian chic. Her voice was no less dark. This was Edith Piaf with the elegance and femme fatale allure of Marlene Dietrich, singing songs that were part Kurt Weill, part jazz and a large part French chanson. </p> <p>Gr\u00e9co was also a success as an actress. By the 50s Hollywood had recognised her glamour and she appeared alongside Orson Welles, Ingrid Bergman and Errol Flynn. But perhaps her most memorable and deservedly famous role was as the leather-jacketed gang leader - Queen of the Bacchantes - in Cocteau's Orph\u00e9e, with Jean Marais. </p> <p>Cocteau had based the character on Gr\u00e9co's own persona. Although only in her late teens when she first met Sartre and Cocteau, Gr\u00e9co already had a self-possession beyond her years, an anti-establishment disdain and a tendency not only to stick two fingers up at her adversaries but frequently to offer her fists. \"I was a very difficult young person and I was very violent. I used to fight,\" she recalls in a voice that sounds at least 20 years younger than her 73 years. \"When you have a stupid person in front of you, or someone who's a little fascist, when you feel there are no more words, you feel like hitting them. So I did. And that's how Cocteau saw me.\" </p> <p>It was this anti-authoritarian stance, coupled with the literary pedigree of her songs' lyrics, that made Gr\u00e9co a star. Her life mirrored that of the French as a nation during and after the second world war. Her Corsican father had left the family home in the Dordogne when Gr\u00e9co was a child, and her mother and sister were sent to concentration camps for Resistance activities when she was 15. A year later Gr\u00e9co herself was arrested and spent a month in a prison cell that she shared with three prostitutes. After a strict convent upbringing, it was a rude awakening. </p> <p>But on her release, finding herself alone in Paris, Gr\u00e9co was taken in by a friend who introduced her to Sartre and his circle. Sartre was already a cult hero by this time, and the older man quickly became her friend and mentor, captivated by what appeared to be a genuinely free spirit. </p> <p> Hers was the spirit of the time, and that was to be part of Gr\u00e9co's great fortune. The years immediately after the war saw an enormous unleashing of pent-up emotions and frustrations, and the centre of the new-found freedom was the area of Saint Germain des Pr\u00e9s on the left bank of the Seine. The area's caf\u00e9s, bars and nightclubs quickly became a magnet for writers, artists, musicians and philosophers. </p> <p>\"It was absolutely magic,\" says Gr\u00e9co. \"Freedom happened, and suddenly we could talk and we could speak loud and we could walk in the street without having eyes in our back. We were free, and to be free is the most precious thing in life.\" </p> <p>Sartre subsequently based the singer in his Roads to Freedom trilogy on Gr\u00e9co, but it was his decision to write songs for her that had the greatest impact on her career. Handing her a newly finished song before she went on her first tour outside France, he told her, \"Here - this will be your passport.\" \"And,\" she agrees, \"they were my passport, those songs. My whole life.\" </p> <p>Sartre's idea to write for Gr\u00e9co came in 1949 when she was asked to sing at the reopening of the famous prewar night club Le Boeuf sur le Tot. She had already been singing in the Tabou club - the centre of Saint Germain nightlife, but she needed new material for the venue. Sartre offered her some poems to adapt and suggested the composer Joseph Kosma could provide the music. </p> <p>Gr\u00e9co and her material proved a sensation, and over the next few years she recorded songs by virtually every major writer of the time. The idea that such revered names as Sartre, Camus and Pr\u00e9vert could write lyrics for a chanteuse seemed revolutionary. But to Sartre it seemed entirely natural. \"Playwrights write for actors,\" he said, \"so why shouldn't one write poems for a singer? The writer often forgets that words have a sensual beauty. Gr\u00e9co's voice reminds us. Gentle, warm and light, her voice rekindles their fire. I wrote those songs because of her and for the pleasure of seeing my words become precious stones.\" </p> <p>The lyrics talked of love, life, death and freedom, but while the non- conformity of the Left Bank set reflected the feelings of many French people, others were scandalised when rumours spread about the extent of Gr\u00e9co's free-living. \"I am different,\" Gr\u00e9co said later. \"I was born liberated and scandalous. I am not vain, I am proud, and yes, I have the right to have a body.\" Some of the more conservative sectors of society were shocked further still when Gr\u00e9co began a lengthy relationship with a black man - Miles Davis, who had newly arrived in Paris. \"We just fell in love, you know. It was just one look and it was quite amazing. It was a coup de foudre,\" she says. Gr\u00e9co's courage gained her further fame as she stood up to the prejudice, spitting in the hand of a restaurant matre d' who refused to serve her and Davis. </p> <p>Her songwriters played up to her reputation for scandal, and numbers such as D\u00e9shabillez-Moi (Undress Me) and Je Hais les Dimanches (I Hate Sundays) became her signature tunes, along with classics such as l'Eternel F\u00e9minin (The Eternal Feminine) and Pr\u00e9vert's Les Feuilles Mortes (Autumn Leaves). </p> <p>By the end of the 50s, when Gainsbourg offered to write for her, she was an international star. The two had dinner and the next day Gainsbourg arrived at her door with La Javanaise - a song now so ingrained in French culture that it is learnt by children at school. </p> <p>Gainsbourg went on to write many more songs for her over the next few years and, despite the arrival of the Beatles and the \"y\u00e9 y\u00e9\" boom, Gr\u00e9co remained a national heroine. </p> <p>Forty years later she is still revered - as much for what she stood for as for her songs. And this is at least part of her enduring appeal. It is the independent spirit that inspired Sartre et al, the woman who was not afraid to live her life in the way she wanted. \"Je suis une femme debout,\" she says. \"I don't lose my dignity.\" </p> <p>Juliette Gr\u00e9co is at the Barbican, London EC2 (020-7638 8891), on June 30.</p>",

My whole life.\" Sartre's idea to write for Gr\u00e9co came in 1949 when she was asked to sing at the reopening of the famous prewar night club Le Boeuf sur le Tot. She had already been singing in the Tabou club - the centre of Saint Germain nightlife, but she needed new material for the venue. Sartre offered her some poems to adapt and suggested the composer Joseph Kosma could provide the music. Gr\u00e9co and her material proved a sensation, and over the next few years she recorded songs by virtually every major writer of the time. The idea that such revered names as Sartre, Camus and Pr\u00e9vert could write lyrics for a chanteuse seemed revolutionary. But to Sartre it seemed entirely natural. \"Playwrights write for actors,\" he said, \"so why shouldn't one write poems for a singer? The writer often forgets that words have a sensual beauty. Gr\u00e9co's voice reminds us. Gentle, warm and light, her voice rekindles their fire. I wrote those songs because of her and for the pleasure of seeing my words become precious stones.\" The lyrics talked of love, life, death and freedom, but while the non- conformity of the Left Bank set reflected the feelings of many French people, others were scandalised when rumours spread about the extent of Gr\u00e9co's free-living. \"I am different,\" Gr\u00e9co said later. \"I was born liberated and scandalous. I am not vain, I am proud, and yes, I have the right to have a body.\" Some of the more conservative sectors of society were shocked further still when Gr\u00e9co began a lengthy relationship with a black man - Miles Davis, who had newly arrived in Paris. \"We just fell in love, you know. It was just one look and it was quite amazing. It was a coup de foudre,\" she says. Gr\u00e9co's courage gained her further fame as she stood up to the prejudice, spitting in the hand of a restaurant matre d' who refused to serve her and Davis. Her songwriters played up to her reputation for scandal, and numbers such as D\u00e9shabillez-Moi (Undress Me) and Je Hais les Dimanches (I Hate Sundays) became her signature tunes, along with classics such as l'Eternel F\u00e9minin (The Eternal Feminine) and Pr\u00e9vert's Les Feuilles Mortes (Autumn Leaves). By the end of the 50s, when Gainsbourg offered to write for her, she was an international star. The two had dinner and the next day Gainsbourg arrived at her door with La Javanaise - a song now so ingrained in French culture that it is learnt by children at school. Gainsbourg went on to write many more songs for her over the next few years and, despite the arrival of the Beatles and the \"y\u00e9 y\u00e9\" boom, Gr\u00e9co remained a national heroine. Forty years later she is still revered - as much for what she stood for as for her songs. And this is at least part of her enduring appeal. It is the independent spirit that inspired Sartre et al, the woman who was not afraid to live her life in the way she wanted. \"Je suis une femme debout,\" she says. \"I don't lose my dignity.\" Juliette Gr\u00e9co is at the Barbican, London EC2 (020-7638 8891), on June 30.",

      "body": "<p>Tony Blair and Jack Straw set much store by something called the contract with society. Every Briton has one. We're all contracted to do our duty. The contract is especially visible in New Labour sentiment about both law and order and social security. All benefits, says Labour, are conditional on people fulfilling their side of the social bargain. All law-breakers violate not only the criminal code but this larger civil contract, on which social order depends and through which citizens must learn to respect their obligations.</p> <p>This may be a useful way of expressing the principle of community. As metaphor, it has value. But now the government wants an extension. Breach of contract is being deemed fit for a penalty which is, in its way, unique. The extension is breezing through parliament. The House of Lords has a last chance to stop it today. The issue is narrow but deep, the case for the government seductive - but ultimately repellent. What does society really want from these contracts? New Labour refuses to recognise that they can be poisonously oppressive.</p> <p>The issue arises low down the ladder of contractors, among the very poorest. Community service orders, imposed by the courts for a range of mostly petty crimes, are, as is well known, sometimes not obeyed. The community work is not done, offenders fail to clock in when they should, and so on. When this happens, the court that imposed the order looks at the circumstances. Maybe the order is reimposed, maybe the offender is reassessed, maybe he goes to jail. This is a messy world, full of inadequates, of people going missing, of social chaos. The probation service, along with the magistrates courts, does its best to keep control.</p> <p>Meanwhile, pending further adjudication, the alleged breaker of a community order receives social security benefits. Enter the new revision of the social contract. Benefits are now to be removed, peremptorily, without court intervention. Breaches are often contested. That's what courts are for. But now the diktat of the Department of Social Security will replace the court, after a probation officer has reported an alleged breach. Forty per cent of income support and 100% of jobseeker's allowance will immediately be docked. If it takes six weeks, the average, for the court case to come up, that means six weeks on starvation rations or, quite possibly, nothing - unless \"hardship\" money has been allowed, itself a process that takes a minimum two weeks.</p> <p>This, remember, is to be the fate of the very poor, against whom no new offence has yet been proved. Wealthier breakers of CSOs won't suffer, until the court hears the case. The unemployed will have double penalties: first the removal of benefit then, if guilty, the further punishment, all this to take place in a context whose purpose is supposed to be getting damaged and otherwise hopeless people back into work and society.</p> <p>That version of the social contract has powerful supporters. It's all about message, they say. The breaker of a CSO is typically a chronic menace, terrorising housing estates, vandalising neighbours' lives, scorning the very concept of community order. Lord Warner, a former Straw adviser, is incredulous of critics. Such offenders mustn't keep on getting benefit, he said. They've broken a contract, one of the terms of which is to abide by court orders. In any case, the punishment \"will be no more than a four-week deprivation of benefit. . . This does not seem to me to be a very onerous set of circumstances.\" To another government peer, backwoodsman reborn, the issue of benefit-loss was even simpler: \"Why can't these people toe the line when they know the issue with which they are faced?\"</p> <p>Such ruthless dispensing with existing rights rests, however, on a grotesquely one-sided view of contract. First, a valid contract can exist only between two parties that both know what they are doing. The kind of people commonly subject to CSOs are too often irrational, unaware, reckless and cruelly pressured by their lives. The idea that a change in the law that hits them hardest will make them more aware of their personal contract is the invention of politicians desperate for quick fixes. But second, no contract with society can exist that excludes the court as prime adjudicator. It's elementary. By breaking that term, the government not the miscreant looks more like the law-breaker, refusing to acknowledge a fundamental contractual duty.</p> <p>The social crimes that CSOs address are serious. Failure to comply is widespread, though not so rife as some government propaganda suggests: only a minority of non-compliers, when caught, are sent to prison. The probation service has toughened up its act. Within the skein of social breakdown that most of us never see, the issues are complex and the remedies often inventive. This initiative, hitting a lot of hard nuts where any law-and-order populist must think entirely justified, surely just breaks a fragment of innocuous new ground. That's the argument.</p> <p>There are two objections. They seem to me overwhelming. The first is practical. The Penal Affairs Consortium, representing 41 organisations concerned with the penal system, says the measure is \"retrograde, counter- productive and bound to increase crime\". Offenders who find themselves suddenly without money are likely to reoffend. That's their impulse, what they're good at, the only way to survive when left in limbo. Nobody has come forward to rebut this probability, save some Labour stoolies in the Lords rabbiting on about it being an insult to the unemployed to say they're more likely to offend than other people. It is just about universally agreed that the price of making this big public statement, that reoffenders must not get social benefits, will be an increase in reoffending.</p> <p>Second, the principle of punishment before conviction is being too smoothly accepted as quite proper for people already on their uppers. The CSO is not an administrative condition, but a judicial penalty. Its breaching should be not for civil servants but judges to decide. Pious language about social contracts doesn't address that point, any more than sanctimonious ranting about the socialist case for protecting victims of lawless housing-estate marauders.</p> <p>Lady Hollis, the minister who will lead today, almost admits that withdrawal of benefit is being used as punishment. She claimed this was \"not our primary intent\", but didn't deny it was a common perception. She also said she \"would not on principle rule out further extensions\". The conditions of benefit, in other words, might well be extended as swiftly as this one has appeared. The culture of administrative decision slowly glides to dominance over that of judicial propriety - as long as you're poor enough to be so easily victimised. Is it for this that Lady Hollis and her boss, Alistair Darling, became Labour politicians?</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:hugoyoung@compuserve.com\">hugoyoung@compuserve.com</a></p>",

That version of the social contract has powerful supporters. It's all about message, they say. The breaker of a CSO is typically a chronic menace, terrorising housing estates, vandalising neighbours' lives, scorning the very concept of community order. Lord Warner, a former Straw adviser, is incredulous of critics. Such offenders mustn't keep on getting benefit, he said. They've broken a contract, one of the terms of which is to abide by court orders. In any case, the punishment \"will be no more than a four-week deprivation of benefit. . . This does not seem to me to be a very onerous set of circumstances.\" To another government peer, backwoodsman reborn, the issue of benefit-loss was even simpler: \"Why can't these people toe the line when they know the issue with which they are faced?\" Such ruthless dispensing with existing rights rests, however, on a grotesquely one-sided view of contract. First, a valid contract can exist only between two parties that both know what they are doing. The kind of people commonly subject to CSOs are too often irrational, unaware, reckless and cruelly pressured by their lives. The idea that a change in the law that hits them hardest will make them more aware of their personal contract is the invention of politicians desperate for quick fixes. But second, no contract with society can exist that excludes the court as prime adjudicator. It's elementary. By breaking that term, the government not the miscreant looks more like the law-breaker, refusing to acknowledge a fundamental contractual duty. The social crimes that CSOs address are serious. Failure to comply is widespread, though not so rife as some government propaganda suggests: only a minority of non-compliers, when caught, are sent to prison. The probation service has toughened up its act. Within the skein of social breakdown that most of us never see, the issues are complex and the remedies often inventive. This initiative, hitting a lot of hard nuts where any law-and-order populist must think entirely justified, surely just breaks a fragment of innocuous new ground. That's the argument. There are two objections. They seem to me overwhelming. The first is practical. The Penal Affairs Consortium, representing 41 organisations concerned with the penal system, says the measure is \"retrograde, counter- productive and bound to increase crime\". Offenders who find themselves suddenly without money are likely to reoffend. That's their impulse, what they're good at, the only way to survive when left in limbo. Nobody has come forward to rebut this probability, save some Labour stoolies in the Lords rabbiting on about it being an insult to the unemployed to say they're more likely to offend than other people. It is just about universally agreed that the price of making this big public statement, that reoffenders must not get social benefits, will be an increase in reoffending. Second, the principle of punishment before conviction is being too smoothly accepted as quite proper for people already on their uppers. The CSO is not an administrative condition, but a judicial penalty. Its breaching should be not for civil servants but judges to decide. Pious language about social contracts doesn't address that point, any more than sanctimonious ranting about the socialist case for protecting victims of lawless housing-estate marauders. Lady Hollis, the minister who will lead today, almost admits that withdrawal of benefit is being used as punishment. She claimed this was \"not our primary intent\", but didn't deny it was a common perception. She also said she \"would not on principle rule out further extensions\". The conditions of benefit, in other words, might well be extended as swiftly as this one has appeared. The culture of administrative decision slowly glides to dominance over that of judicial propriety - as long as you're poor enough to be so easily victimised. Is it for this that Lady Hollis and her boss, Alistair Darling, became Labour politicians? hugoyoung@compuserve.com",

He admits to assaulting her repeatedly during their eight years together. But without her he is lost. Karla, a striking woman with a capacity for tenderness, believes Colin hides behind his fierce image.

      "standfirst": "In 1958, a brilliant but socially inept 15-year-old began his studies at Harvard. Like many of his peers, he volunteered for a number of personality tests in return for a small fee. Only these were no ordinary tests. And the student was Ted Kaczynski - now better known as the Unabomber. By  Alston Chase",

      "body": "<p>Like many Harvard alumni, I sometimes wander the neighborhood when I return to Cambridge, reminiscing about the old days and musing on how different my life has been from what I hoped and expected then. Last fall, my return there was prompted not by nostalgia but by curiosity.</p> <p>I found myself a few blocks north of Harvard Yard, on Divinity Avenue. No 7 Divinity Avenue is a modern multi-story academic building today, housing the university's department of molecular and cellular biology. In 1959 a comfortable old house stood on the site. Known as the Annex, it served as a laboratory in which staff members of the department of social relations conducted research on human subjects. There, from the fall of 1959 through the spring of 1962, Harvard psychologists, led by professor Henry A Murray, conducted a disturbing and what would now be seen as ethically indefensible experiment on 22 undergraduates. To preserve the anonymity of these student guinea pigs, experimenters referred to individuals by code name only. One of these students, whom they dubbed \"Lawful\", was Theodore John Kaczynski, who would one day be known as the Unabomber, and who would later mail or deliver 16 package bombs to scientists, academics, and others over 17 years, killing three people and injuring 23.</p> <p>I first heard of the Murray experiment from Kaczynski himself. We had begun corresponding in July 1998, a couple of months after a federal court in Sacramento sentenced him to life without possibility of parole.</p> <p>Kaczynski, I quickly discovered, was an indefatigable correspondent. He hinted darkly that the Murray Center seemed to feel it had something to hide. One of his defence investigators, he said, reported that the center had told participating psychologists not to talk with his defence team.</p> <p>Through research at the Murray Center and in the Harvard archives I found that, among its other purposes, Henry Murray's experiment was intended to measure how people react under stress. Murray subjected his unwitting students, including Kaczynski, to intensive interrogation - what Murray himself called \"vehement, sweeping, and personally abusive\" attacks, assaulting his subjects' egos and most - cherished ideals and beliefs. My quest was specific - to determine what effects, if any, the experiment may have had on Kaczynski.</p> <p>Kaczynski was accepted by Harvard in the spring of 1958; he was not yet 16 years old. One friend remembers urging Kaczynski's father, Turk, not to let the boy go, arguing, \"He's too young, too immature, and Harvard too impersonal.\" But Turk wouldn't listen. \"Ted's going to Harvard was an ego trip for him,\" the friend recalls.</p> <p>Murray, a wealthy and blue-blooded New Yorker, was both a scientist and a humanist. Before the war he had been the director of the Harvard Psychological Clinic; during it, he served in the Office of Strategic Services, the forerunner of the CIA, helping develop psychological screening tests for applicants and monitoring military experiments on brainwashing.</p> <p>After the war Murray returned to Harvard, where he continued to refine techniques of personality assessment. By 1950 he had resumed studies on Harvard undergraduates that he had begun, in rudimentary form, before the war, titled Multiform Assessments of Personality Development Among Gifted College Men. The experiment in which Kaczynski participated was the last and most elaborate of these. In their postwar form these experiments focused on stressful interpersonal relations, designing confrontations akin to those mock interrogations he had helped to orchestrate for the OSS.</p> <p>Kaczynski has said that he was \"pressured into participating\". His hesitation turned out to be sensible. Researchers gave the volunteers almost no information about the experiment in which they would participate. Each was simply asked to answer yes to the following question: \"Would you be willing to contribute to the solution of certain psychological problems (parts of an on-going program of research in the development of personality), by serving as a subject in a series of experiments or taking a number of tests (average about 2 hours a week) through the academic year (at the current College rate per hour)?\"</p> <p>In fact it would never be clear what the \"certain psychological problems\" were. And the test that served as the centrepiece for this undertaking appears remarkably similar to the old OSS stress test. Students would be given the third degree. But whereas the OSS applicants must have known that enduring unpleasant interrogations could be part of their job, these students did not. The intent was to catch them by surprise, to deceive them, and to brutalise them. The students were led to believe that they would debate their philosophy of life with another student like themselves. In fact they were confronted by a well-prepared \"stooge\" - a lawyer.</p> <p>When the subject arrived, he was escorted to a \"brilliantly lighted room\" and seated in front of a one-way mirror. A motion-picture camera recorded his every move and facial expression through a hole in the wall. Electrodes leading to machines that recorded his heart and respiratory rates were attached to his body.</p> <p>Forrest Robinson, the author of a biography of Murray, has described what happened next.</p> <p>\"As instructed, the unwitting subject attempted to represent and to defend his personal philosophy of life. Invariably, however, he was frustrated, and finally brought to expressions of real anger, by the withering assault of his older, more sophisticated opponent ... while fluctuations in the subject's pulse and respiration were measured.\"</p> <p>Not surprisingly, most participants found this highly unpleasant, even traumatic. \"We were led into the room with bright lights, very bright,\" one of them, code-named Cringle, recalled afterward. \"[I] had a sensation somewhat akin to someone being strapped on the electric chair with these electrodes ... I really started getting hit real hard ... Wham, wham, wham! And me get ting hotter and more irritated and my heartbeat going up ... and sweating terribly ...\"</p> <p>\"Right away,\" said another, code-named Trump, describing his experience afterward, \"I didn't like [the interrogator].</p> <p>\"[Dr G] ... came waltzing over and he put on those electrodes but in that process, while he was doing that, kind of whistling ... And then [Mr R] . . . who was bubbling over, dancing around, started to talk to me about he liked my suit ... the buzzer would ring or something like that, we were supposed to begin ... he was being sarcastic or pretty much of a wise guy ... And the first thing that entered my mind was to get up and ask him outside immediately ... but that was out of the question, because the electrodes and the movie and all that ... I kind of sat there and began to fume and then he went on and he got my goat and I couldn't think of what to say ... And then they came along and they took my electrodes off.\"</p> <p>During the last year of the experiment Murray made the students available to his graduate-student assistants, to serve as guinea pigs for their own research projects. By graduation, as Kenneth Keniston, one of these researchers, summarised the process later, \"each student had spent approximately 200 hours in the research, and had provided hundreds of pages of information about himself, his beliefs, his past life, his family, his college life and development, his fantasies, his hopes and dreams.\"</p> <p>Why were the students willing to endure this ongoing stress and probing into their private lives? Some who had assisted Murray in the experiment confessed to me that they wondered about this themselves. But they - and we - can only speculate that some of the students (including Kaczynski) did it for the money, that some (again, probably including Kaczynski) had doubts about their own psychic health and were seeking reassurance about it, that some, suffering from Harvard's well-known anomie, were lonely and needed someone to talk to, and that some simply had an interest in helping to advance scientific knowledge. But in truth we do not know. Alden E Wessman, a former research associate of Murray who has long been bothered by the unethical dimension of this study, said to me recently, \"Later, I thought: 'We took and took and used them and what did we give them in return?' \"</p> <p>What was the purpose of the experiment? Keniston told me that he wasn't sure what the goals were. \"Murray was not the most systematic scientist,\" he explained.</p> <p>Murray himself gave curiously equivocal answers. Sometimes he suggested that his research might have no value at all. \"Cui bono?\" he once asked. \"As [the data] stand they are nothing but raw data, meaningless as such; and the question is what meaning, what intellectual news, can be extracted from them?\" In another context he asked, \"Are the costs in man-hours incurred by our elaborate, multiple procedures far greater than any possible gains in knowledge?\"</p> <p>Such equivocation prompts one to ask if the experiment could have had a purpose that Murray was reluctant to divulge. Was the multiform-assessments project intended, at least in part, to help the CIA determine how to test, or break down, an individual's ability to withstand interrogation? The writer Alexander Cockburn has asked whether the students might have been given the hallucinogenic drug LSD without their knowledge, possibly at the request of the CIA. By the late 50s, according to some, Murray had become quite interested in hallucinogenics, including LSD and psilocybin. And soon after Murray's experiments on Kaczynski and his classmates were under way, in 1960, Timothy Leary returned to Harvard and, with Murray's blessing, began his experiments with psilocybin.</p> <p>In his autobiography, Leary, who would dedicate the rest of his life to promoting hallucinogenic drugs, described Murray as \"the wizard of personality assessment who, as OSS chief psychologist, had monitored military experiments on brainwashing and sodium amytal interrogation. Murray expressed great interest in our drug-research project and offered his support.\"</p> <p>It is clear that Murray's experiment deeply affected at least some of its subjects. Even 25 years later some recalled the unpleasantness. In 1987 Cringle remembered the \"anger and embarrassment ... the glass partition ... the electrodes and wires running up our sleeves.\"</p> <p>Likewise, 25 years later Drill still had \"very vivid general memories of the experience ... I remember someone putting electrodes and blood pressure counter on my arm just before the filming ... [I] was startled by [my interlocutor's] venom ... I remember responding with unabating rage.\"</p> <p>And 25 years later, Locust wrote: \"I remember appearing one afternoon for a 'debate' and being hooked up to electrodes and sat in a chair with bright lights and being told a movie was being made ... I remember him attacking me, even insulting me, for my values, or for opinions I had expressed in my written material ... I remember being shocked by the severity of the attack, and I remember feeling helpless to respond . . . What is the point of this? They have deceived me, telling me there was going to be a discussion, when in fact there was an attack.\"</p> <p>We don't know what effect this experiment may have had on Kaczynski. I did not have access to his records, and therefore cannot attest to his degree of alienation then. Kaczynski must certainly have been among the most vulnerable of Murray's experimental subjects - a point that the researchers seem to have missed. He was among the youngest and the poorest of the group. He may have come from a dysfunctional home.</p> <p>As Kaczynski's college life continued, outwardly he seemed to be adjusting to Harvard. But inwardly he increasingly seethed. According to Sally Johnson, the forensic psychiatrist who examined Kaczynski, he began worrying about his health. He began having terrible nightmares. He started having fantasies about taking revenge against a society that he increasingly viewed as an evil force obsessed with imposing conformism through psychological controls.</p> <p>These thoughts upset Kaczynski all the more because they exposed his ineffectuality. Johnson reported that he would become horribly angry with himself because he could not express this fury openly. \"I never attempted to put any such fantasies into effect,\" she quoted from his writings, \"because I was too strongly conditioned ... against any defiance of authority ... I could not have committed a crime of revenge, even a relatively minor crime, because . . . my fear of being caught and punished was all out of proportion to the actual danger of being caught.\"</p> <p>Kaczynski felt that justice demanded that he take revenge on society. But he lacked the personal resources at that time to do so. He was - had always been - a good boy. Instead he would seek escape. He began to dream about breaking away from society and living a primitive life. According to Johnson, he \"began to study information about wild edible plants\" and to spend time learning about the wilderness. And like many American intellectuals before him he began to form a plan to seek personal renewal in nature.</p> <p>Today, society would not tolerate the deceptions inherent in the Murray experiments. But different standards prevailed then, and its ethics were definitely acceptable in their day. But the ethics of the day were wrong. And they framed Kaczynski's first encounter with a reckless scientific value system that elevated the pursuit of scientific truth above human rights.</p> <p>When, soon after, Kaczynski began to worry about the possibility of mind control, he was not giving vent to paranoid delusions. In view of Murray's experiment, he was not only rational but right. The university and the psychiatric establishment had been willing accomplices in an experiment that had treated human beings as guinea pigs, and had treated them brutally. Here is a powerful logical foundation for Kaczynski's latterly expressed conviction that academics, in particular scientists, were thoroughly compromised servants of \"the system\", employed in the development of techniques for the behavioral control of populations.</p> <p>It was the confluence of two streams of development that transformed Kaczynski into the Unabomber. One stream was personal, fed by his anger toward his family and those who he felt had slighted or hurt him, in high school and college. The other derived from his philosophical critique of society and its institutions, and reflected the culture of despair he encountered at Harvard and later. The Murray experiment, containing both psychological and philosophical components, may well have fed both streams.</p> <p>A longer version of this article appears in this month's issue of Atlantic Monthly.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Like many Harvard alumni, I sometimes wander the neighborhood when I return to Cambridge, reminiscing about the old days and musing on how different my life has been from what I hoped and expected then. Last fall, my return there was prompted not by nostalgia but by curiosity. I found myself a few blocks north of Harvard Yard, on Divinity Avenue. No 7 Divinity Avenue is a modern multi-story academic building today, housing the university's department of molecular and cellular biology. In 1959 a comfortable old house stood on the site. Known as the Annex, it served as a laboratory in which staff members of the department of social relations conducted research on human subjects. There, from the fall of 1959 through the spring of 1962, Harvard psychologists, led by professor Henry A Murray, conducted a disturbing and what would now be seen as ethically indefensible experiment on 22 undergraduates. To preserve the anonymity of these student guinea pigs, experimenters referred to individuals by code name only. One of these students, whom they dubbed \"Lawful\", was Theodore John Kaczynski, who would one day be known as the Unabomber, and who would later mail or deliver 16 package bombs to scientists, academics, and others over 17 years, killing three people and injuring 23. I first heard of the Murray experiment from Kaczynski himself. We had begun corresponding in July 1998, a couple of months after a federal court in Sacramento sentenced him to life without possibility of parole. Kaczynski, I quickly discovered, was an indefatigable correspondent. He hinted darkly that the Murray Center seemed to feel it had something to hide. One of his defence investigators, he said, reported that the center had told participating psychologists not to talk with his defence team. Through research at the Murray Center and in the Harvard archives I found that, among its other purposes, Henry Murray's experiment was intended to measure how people react under stress. Murray subjected his unwitting students, including Kaczynski, to intensive interrogation - what Murray himself called \"vehement, sweeping, and personally abusive\" attacks, assaulting his subjects' egos and most - cherished ideals and beliefs. My quest was specific - to determine what effects, if any, the experiment may have had on Kaczynski. Kaczynski was accepted by Harvard in the spring of 1958; he was not yet 16 years old. One friend remembers urging Kaczynski's father, Turk, not to let the boy go, arguing, \"He's too young, too immature, and Harvard too impersonal.\" But Turk wouldn't listen. \"Ted's going to Harvard was an ego trip for him,\" the friend recalls. Murray, a wealthy and blue-blooded New Yorker, was both a scientist and a humanist. Before the war he had been the director of the Harvard Psychological Clinic; during it, he served in the Office of Strategic Services, the forerunner of the CIA, helping develop psychological screening tests for applicants and monitoring military experiments on brainwashing. After the war Murray returned to Harvard, where he continued to refine techniques of personality assessment. By 1950 he had resumed studies on Harvard undergraduates that he had begun, in rudimentary form, before the war, titled Multiform Assessments of Personality Development Among Gifted College Men. The experiment in which Kaczynski participated was the last and most elaborate of these. In their postwar form these experiments focused on stressful interpersonal relations, designing confrontations akin to those mock interrogations he had helped to orchestrate for the OSS. Kaczynski has said that he was \"pressured into participating\". His hesitation turned out to be sensible. Researchers gave the volunteers almost no information about the experiment in which they would participate. Each was simply asked to answer yes to the following question: \"Would you be willing to contribute to the solution of certain psychological problems (parts of an on-going program of research in the development of personality), by serving as a subject in a series of experiments or taking a number of tests (average about 2 hours a week) through the academic year (at the current College rate per hour)?\" In fact it would never be clear what the \"certain psychological problems\" were.

      "body": "<p>Whatever the outcome of Zimbabwe's parliamentary elections this weekend, the period following the results will be nearly as crucial as the voting itself.</p> <p>Whichever side wins, President Robert Mugabe's ruling Zanu-PF party or the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), it will be important to see if the loser accepts defeat. There is a danger that either side, but particularly Zanu-PF in the event of an MDC victory, will violently reject the result.</p> <p>Zimbabwe has been traumatised by the terror unleashed by Mugabe during the election campaign, yet the opposition has grown in strength. The MDC appears on the verge of a historic victory, in which it could win a majority of the 120 elected seats, and possibly of the total 150 parliamentary seats (Mugabe appoints 30 of them). The mood of the country has swung in its favour. The intimidation and the blatant propaganda of the state news media appear only to have infuriated the public.</p> <p>The small and listless crowds at rallies for Mugabe and the Zanu-PF candidates have been dramatically shown up by the turnouts for the MDC - even though MDC supporters knew that they were exposing themselves to the risk of beatings by attending the rallies.</p> <p>Certainly Zanu-PF's current stranglehold on parliament, in which it held all but three seats, is over. At the very least, the MDC should win 40 seats, which would be an impressive accomplishment. The nine-month-old opposition party has been able to campaign freely only in 25 constituencies. With 40 seats, the MDC could function as a viable opposition, working to hold the government accountable.</p> <p>But it is likely that the MDC will win more than 60 seats. It should sweep all 40 in urban and semi-urban areas, where antipathy to the government is particularly marked. The two southern provinces of Matabeleland should provide another 12 MDC seats because of the hatred the Matabele people have for Zanu-PF. They cannot forget the massacres of the mid-80s, in which 10,000 to 20,000 Matabele civilians were killed by the army on Mugabe's orders. The eastern province of Manicaland, which voted strongly against Mugabe's draft constitution in the February referendum, is expected to provide another 12 MDC seats. That would bring the MDC 64 seats. There would be considerable domestic and international pressure on Mugabe not to load the 30 appointed seats with Zanu-PF stalwarts - and several Zanu-PF backbenchers might be encouraged to cross the floor and join the MDC, at least on crucial issues such as the Congo war, land reform and economic management.</p> <p>A recent public opinion poll suggests the MDC might even do better than this, winning 70 seats, and political analysts at the University of Zimbabwe say it could win 80 and an absolute parliamentary majority.</p> <p>The MDC might be an unknown quantity to outsiders. But inside Zimbabwe it seems to offer the best hope of reversing the economic decline and the racial and social divisions caused by Mugabe's policies.</p> <p>Mugabe has driven Zimbabwe's once strong economy to its knees. The MDC has attracted top businessmen and economists, black and white, who have put together an impressive recovery package. The cabinet will be reduced from Mugabe's 54 ministers to just 15. Government spending will be reduced accordingly, in particular by withdrawing Zimbabwe's 13,000 troops from the Congo war, which is estimated to be costing US$32m a month.</p> <p>Morgan Tsvangirai, the president of MDC, has been a dynamic labour leader for 20 years, and the party's base comes from the trade union movement. But Tsvangirai and others recognise that pragmatic market-driven economic policies will encourage economic growth.</p> <p>Tsvangirai also offers a return to respect for civil rights. He wants the police to uphold the law and for the government to respect court rulings. The MDC says a commission of justice must investigate the 30 murders and the thousands of beatings committed by Zanu-PF. It will not seek retribution, but the country must have justice.</p> <p>The MDC also has a wealth of expertise in its ranks. As well as labour leaders, it has attracted human rights lawyers, women's activists, leaders of student groups and community leaders from across the country. In ordinary circumstances, it is almost certain that the MDC would win a parliamentary majority and form the next government.</p> <p>But Mugabe and his party are desperate and determined. They have changed the voting regulations twice in the past week to reduce the role of independent monitors.

      "bodyText": "Whatever the outcome of Zimbabwe's parliamentary elections this weekend, the period following the results will be nearly as crucial as the voting itself. Whichever side wins, President Robert Mugabe's ruling Zanu-PF party or the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), it will be important to see if the loser accepts defeat. There is a danger that either side, but particularly Zanu-PF in the event of an MDC victory, will violently reject the result. Zimbabwe has been traumatised by the terror unleashed by Mugabe during the election campaign, yet the opposition has grown in strength. The MDC appears on the verge of a historic victory, in which it could win a majority of the 120 elected seats, and possibly of the total 150 parliamentary seats (Mugabe appoints 30 of them). The mood of the country has swung in its favour. The intimidation and the blatant propaganda of the state news media appear only to have infuriated the public. The small and listless crowds at rallies for Mugabe and the Zanu-PF candidates have been dramatically shown up by the turnouts for the MDC - even though MDC supporters knew that they were exposing themselves to the risk of beatings by attending the rallies. Certainly Zanu-PF's current stranglehold on parliament, in which it held all but three seats, is over. At the very least, the MDC should win 40 seats, which would be an impressive accomplishment. The nine-month-old opposition party has been able to campaign freely only in 25 constituencies. With 40 seats, the MDC could function as a viable opposition, working to hold the government accountable. But it is likely that the MDC will win more than 60 seats. It should sweep all 40 in urban and semi-urban areas, where antipathy to the government is particularly marked. The two southern provinces of Matabeleland should provide another 12 MDC seats because of the hatred the Matabele people have for Zanu-PF. They cannot forget the massacres of the mid-80s, in which 10,000 to 20,000 Matabele civilians were killed by the army on Mugabe's orders. The eastern province of Manicaland, which voted strongly against Mugabe's draft constitution in the February referendum, is expected to provide another 12 MDC seats. That would bring the MDC 64 seats. There would be considerable domestic and international pressure on Mugabe not to load the 30 appointed seats with Zanu-PF stalwarts - and several Zanu-PF backbenchers might be encouraged to cross the floor and join the MDC, at least on crucial issues such as the Congo war, land reform and economic management. A recent public opinion poll suggests the MDC might even do better than this, winning 70 seats, and political analysts at the University of Zimbabwe say it could win 80 and an absolute parliamentary majority. The MDC might be an unknown quantity to outsiders. But inside Zimbabwe it seems to offer the best hope of reversing the economic decline and the racial and social divisions caused by Mugabe's policies. Mugabe has driven Zimbabwe's once strong economy to its knees. The MDC has attracted top businessmen and economists, black and white, who have put together an impressive recovery package. The cabinet will be reduced from Mugabe's 54 ministers to just 15. Government spending will be reduced accordingly, in particular by withdrawing Zimbabwe's 13,000 troops from the Congo war, which is estimated to be costing US$32m a month. Morgan Tsvangirai, the president of MDC, has been a dynamic labour leader for 20 years, and the party's base comes from the trade union movement. But Tsvangirai and others recognise that pragmatic market-driven economic policies will encourage economic growth. Tsvangirai also offers a return to respect for civil rights. He wants the police to uphold the law and for the government to respect court rulings. The MDC says a commission of justice must investigate the 30 murders and the thousands of beatings committed by Zanu-PF. It will not seek retribution, but the country must have justice. The MDC also has a wealth of expertise in its ranks. As well as labour leaders, it has attracted human rights lawyers, women's activists, leaders of student groups and community leaders from across the country. In ordinary circumstances, it is almost certain that the MDC would win a parliamentary majority and form the next government. But Mugabe and his party are desperate and determined. They have changed the voting regulations twice in the past week to reduce the role of independent monitors. They might as well advertise that they want to increase their chances of rigging. It is quite possible that Zanu-PF will intimidate and rig its way to a spurious victory. And there is also the possibility that Mugabe will use the army to carry out a coup if the MDC wins. But neither course of action would be sustainable. The economy is on the verge of collapse - and the cities are seething with protest. comment@theguardian.com",

She was to become friend, confidante and biographer of Nelson Mandela - but this was a complete change of direction from the ambitions of her early life.</p> <p>She grew up in a comfortable, happy home in Pretoria, younger daughter of Cyril Benson, Irish administrator of the Pretoria General Hospital, and his wife, Lucy Stubbs, descended from 1820 settlers in the Eastern Cape, and with all the colour prejudices of the English-speaking white South African of the time.</p> <p>Mary was a romantic, stage-struck child of passionate determination who, at about 18, succeeded in leaving provincial Pretoria in search of a stage or film career. In London and California, as an ardent fan, she encountered many of the stars, but before she found any personal success the approach of war drove her home. Briefly she was a secretary in the British High Commission. Then, still seeking wider shores, she joined the SA Women's Auxiliary Army Service.</p> <p>In 1942, Benson was in Egypt. Attractive, intelligent, capable and hard-working, she soon was promoted to captain and served as PA to a series of distinguished commanders. There were two unhappy love affairs. She also served in Algeria and Italy, where she lured a production of The Barretts Of Wimpole Street, with old acquaintances Brian Aherne and Katherine Cornell, from Naples to play to the troops in Siena. Then there was work with United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) in Athens and Vienna.</p> <p>After the war, Benson returned to her interest in films and became secretary to David Lean, whose Brief Encounter was showing in London.</p> <p>Benson had a great capacity for making - and keeping - friends, and there were many of them in Britain, America and Africa. She seized an opportunity to return to America and tried to improve her prospects of writing for the screen. But then she read Alan Paton's Cry The Beloved Country (1948) and, extremely moved by it, wrote to him, beginning a life-long friendship. The book awakened her sense of \"African-ness\" and set her thinking of the life of her black fellow South Africans, realising that while working to alleviate the suffering and dreadful deprivations in postwar Europe, she had never considered the parallel conditions endured by millions of South African blacks. She began to feel that it was there that she should be working.</p> <p>With this in mind, she left the US. In London, however, she attended a meeting addressed by the Reverend Michael Scott, an Anglican priest of whose work in South Africa and the UN she vaguely remembered hearing. She was immediately in thrall. Asking if she could be of use, she was installed in a dark little room with piles of assorted papers which she quickly reduced to order. So began a seven-year partnership, and return to South Africa was delayed.</p> <p>Scott at this time was much involved in lobbying the UN on behalf of certain South West African tribes, particularly the Herero and the Nama, who were bitterly opposed to the projected incorporation of their lands into South Africa. Benson, now working for and with African people, found her racial prejudices fade.</p> <p>She became Scott's right hand, writing, speaking, lobbying, her wartime organising experience, writing ability and \"way\" with people being invaluable. Scott's health was very fragile and Mary had often to deputise. Together, and with such figures as Lord Hemingford and David Astor of the Observer, they launched the Africa Bureau in 1952. Its purpose was to inform the British public on African affairs, to enable African leaders to discuss their problems with colonial authorities and to build up support for independence movements.</p> <p>Benson was involved in opposing British colonial policy in forming the Central African Federation and in lobbying for reforms in the High Commission Territories (Botswana, Lesotho and Swaziland). In 1951, when the exiled Tshekedi Khama of the then Bechuanaland (Botswana) came to Britain to negotiate for his return home, she acted as his secretary, the first African she had ever worked for. She came to know him and his family very well. And, some years later, after his untimely death, she undertook his biography, thus beginning her writing career.</p> <p>Benson returned to South Africa in 1956, ending her partnership and deep personal relationship with Scott and the Africa Bureau. The Treason Trial of 156 South Africans of all races had begun, and she was asked to take over the office of the Treason Trial Defence Fund. This enabled her to meet many of the opponents of apartheid and gain a first-hand insight into the conditions under which the majority of the people lived.</p> <p>But deteriorating health forced her resignation, and she went into her father's old hospital in Pretoria, where her illness was diagnosed as rheumatoid arthritis. Cortisone was prescribed, and though it provided no cure, it effectively held the disease at bay and enabled her to continue her punishing career with enormous and determined courage for many years.</p> <p>Meeting so many of the people's leaders gathered in Johannesburg for the trial encouraged her to embark on the hitherto unrecorded history of the African National Congress. She travelled round the country, interviewed many of the older members (Mweli Skota and Canon Calata among them), founders or early officers, and gathered their life stories.</p> <p>When Chief Luthuli was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, she went to Natal to act as his secretary. She had secret interviews with Nelson Mandela, then known as the \"Black Pimpernel\", while he was underground in 1961. In 1964, she had many clandestine meetings with Bram Fischer, the distinguished Afrikaner advocate and one-time leader of the South African Communist party, whom she warmly admired. He had also gone underground to continue his anti-apartheid political work, and through him Mary began to learn about the Afrikaans. All this time she was also attending political trials in remote parts of the country and reporting them overseas.</p> <p>In 1963, she was in the US, invited by the United Nations to testify (the first South African to do so) to the Committee on Apartheid, thus inviting the wrath of the South African government. She travelled in the south of the country, meeting many of the black anti-segregation leaders. The next year, after the Rivonia arrests in South Africa, she was back at the UN to testify, particularly about the men on trial, many of whom she knew.</p> <p>In South Africa, Benson had become deeply interested in the work of the playwright Athol Fugard, who was working for a non-racial theatre, and for breaking the cultural barriers of apartheid. Once again, her latent theatrical interests were aroused and she co-operated with Fugard in the production of his work in Britain and America as well as in South Africa.</p> <p>But this freedom in her own country could not last: in 1966, the authorities imposed a banning order. Unable to move about the country, to meet people, to write or speak in public, she realised she had to leave. She returned there once more, heavily restricted, to be with her father while he was dying.</p> <p>In London, where she settled, she devoted herself to writing. In addition to her two invaluable volumes on the history of the ANC (unique because she was able to interview many now dead), she published a novel At The Still Point (1969) and an autobiography, A Far Cry (1989); for radio she wrote a play and several documentaries, and she frequently broadcast on political developments in South Africa. The stage-struck schoolgirl eventually was able (in a very unforeseen form) to return to her early love - of drama - and combine it with the later love - of her people, white and black.</p> <p>She is survived by a sister.</p> <p><b>Ross Devenish writes:</b> I first became aware of the name Mary Benson when as a boy I read a front-page story in my father's newspaper.

Any England supporter who truly loves their team would have shown that love by recognising the brilliance and courage of their team in that game, irrespective of the result. Alas, at the end of the match, the English supporters stood in chilly, disappointed silence and the TV commentators immediately launched into their cold, critical, destructive discussion.</p> <p>How like those parents who show positive regard for their children only when their children win prizes. This is utter selfishness. If you love your team, you must show that love when your team wins or loses. That way you give them the boost they need to win. No wonder England does so badly in sport. <br><b>Dorothy Rowe</b><br> London<br><a href=\"mailto:Drowe70@cs.com\">Drowe70@cs.com</a></p> <p>\u0095 I am not a football expert, but as the American wife of an Englishman, I have been on hand to witness England's performance in international football competitions since their defeat by the Germans in the 1990 World Cup. Over these years, I have been constantly amazed - and frankly disgusted - by the reaction of the press and so many so-called fans to the team's performance. When any international tournament comes round, the general approach seems to be: expect the English team to be the very worst and don't be satisfied unless they are the very best. This means the manager and individual players can be freely criticised and taunted both on and off the field. They, for their part, are expected to absorb abuse uncomplainingly, overcome it and deliver winning results. When they don't, the knives are out again.</p> <p>Why would a team want to win for fair-weather fans like these? And if after every tournament loss, you call in new management and players, how do you ever expect the team to learn and develop? I say hurrah to Keegan, to Shearer, Beckham, Scholes and the rest of the squad.

Win, lose or draw, we enjoyed ourselves and celebrated being at those tournaments in Germany, Italy and the US.</p> <p>The English proudly boast they gave the world the game so many of us love. But it is also the country that gave us the cancer of soccer hooliganism. The scenes of Charleroi must ensure the 2006 World Cup is not held in England. <br<b> Dermot Keyes <br> Portlaw, Co Waterford </br<b></p> <p>\u0095 Let's just pretend hooligans are miners on strike.

Scots do not cause trouble because they have distanced themselves from their imperial heritage. The British state still stands for empire, a seat on the UN security council and \"punching above our weight\". The songs, chants and tattoos show that, in the dreams of many, the British empire still straddles the globe.

The French historian Marc Bloch, a liaison officer between the British and French armies, made the following comment in his diary in 1940: \"The English soldier obeys well and fights bravely as he has proved once again with his blood in Belgium. But he is a looter and a lewd drunkard. The Englishman on the continent never behaves as he ought ...

      "bodyText": "I watched the England- Romania game only because it was such gripping drama I could not switch to another channel (Late penalty sinks England, June 21). Any England supporter who truly loves their team would have shown that love by recognising the brilliance and courage of their team in that game, irrespective of the result. Alas, at the end of the match, the English supporters stood in chilly, disappointed silence and the TV commentators immediately launched into their cold, critical, destructive discussion. How like those parents who show positive regard for their children only when their children win prizes. This is utter selfishness. If you love your team, you must show that love when your team wins or loses. That way you give them the boost they need to win. No wonder England does so badly in sport. Dorothy Rowe London Drowe70@cs.com \u0095 I am not a football expert, but as the American wife of an Englishman, I have been on hand to witness England's performance in international football competitions since their defeat by the Germans in the 1990 World Cup. Over these years, I have been constantly amazed - and frankly disgusted - by the reaction of the press and so many so-called fans to the team's performance. When any international tournament comes round, the general approach seems to be: expect the English team to be the very worst and don't be satisfied unless they are the very best. This means the manager and individual players can be freely criticised and taunted both on and off the field. They, for their part, are expected to absorb abuse uncomplainingly, overcome it and deliver winning results. When they don't, the knives are out again. Why would a team want to win for fair-weather fans like these? And if after every tournament loss, you call in new management and players, how do you ever expect the team to learn and develop? I say hurrah to Keegan, to Shearer, Beckham, Scholes and the rest of the squad. Thanks for giving it your all and better luck next time. Terri Paddock London Terri@Unmissable.com \u0095 When the Irish national soccer team enjoyed a period of success in the 80s and 90s, our supporters were the greatest ambassadors a tournament could hope for, just as the brilliant Slovenian fans have proven at Euro 2000. Win, lose or draw, we enjoyed ourselves and celebrated being at those tournaments in Germany, Italy and the US. The English proudly boast they gave the world the game so many of us love. But it is also the country that gave us the cancer of soccer hooliganism. The scenes of Charleroi must ensure the 2006 World Cup is not held in England. Dermot Keyes Portlaw, Co Waterford \u0095 Let's just pretend hooligans are miners on strike. It worked in 83-84, didn't it? John Moloney London \u0095 In your articles (Comment, June 20) about the troublemakers who attach themselves to football you missed out one essential ingredient of any solution - the need to sort out the confusions over English-British identity. Scots do not cause trouble because they have distanced themselves from their imperial heritage. The British state still stands for empire, a seat on the UN security council and \"punching above our weight\". The songs, chants and tattoos show that, in the dreams of many, the British empire still straddles the globe. Until this albatross is removed from our necks, England will never adapt to the idea that it is a middle-ranking European power with far more diverse traditions than going round the world bashing up foreigners. Steve Richards London \u0095 English hooliganism in Europe is nothing new. The French historian Marc Bloch, a liaison officer between the British and French armies, made the following comment in his diary in 1940: \"The English soldier obeys well and fights bravely as he has proved once again with his blood in Belgium. But he is a looter and a lewd drunkard. The Englishman on the continent never behaves as he ought ... Once over the Channel he confuses the European with the natives of the British colonies and by definition any such a man is treated as an inferior being.\" Philip Wardle London p.j.wardle@btinternet.com \u0095 So the controversy about the potential exclusion of England from Euro 2000 was for nothing - the team was perfectly capable of arranging its own exit. David Beeson Strasbourg, France \u0095 How can we join the single currency when our football team has just demonstrated that we cannot compete on a level playing field? PL Hurst London \u0095 Maybe we should encourage asylum seekers from Slovenia, Croatia, and Yugoslavia. In five years or so we might have a decent football team. John Garrett Gayton, Merseyside \u0095 They're coming home, they're coming, England's coming home. Three Lions on the shirt ... Brian Lynch Attleborough, Norfolk",

Within three years we should begin to have fundamental insights about the nature of neutrinos, the energy generating processes in the sun, and - because neutrinos are produced by nuclear reactions - perhaps also provide an early warning to astronomers to look out for the brilliance of supernova explosions in our galaxy. \u0095 Frank Close's latest book, Lucifer's Legacy: The Meaning Of Asymmetry is published by Oxford University",

      "body": "<p>Somewhere around 4.20am, half an hour before sunrise, a semi-naked man clambered on top one of the great sarsens of Stonehenge and began inciting the crowd to follow him.</p> <p>In the spooky light and the driving rain, it was a gesture of defiance, a potential return to the 1970s when the Stonehenge free festival became an ugly battleground and the authorities responded by putting the stones off limits at the summer solstice for 15 years.</p> <p>The police - just a few on site but plenty more stashed round the Wiltshire lanes in case of trouble - held their breath. English Heritage, the government's site custodians who had gambled that the masses could police themselves, as they had argued for 15 years, crossed their fingers.</p> <p>The crowd of at least 6,000 - hippies, bards, students, locals, representatives of more than 30 druidical orders, horny road protesters, travellers, witches (white and black), teenagers, gents in robes and wings, the brew crew, resplendent knights of King Arthur's Round Table and a who's who of alternative England - just about stopped dancing to the relentless drums.</p> <p>The women were first on the case: \"Gerroff, yer silly bugger\", came the first cry from the middle of the stones. \"Stupid fucker... we'll never be allowed back,\" said another, dressed as a Queen of the Night. \"Idiot,\" said the third.</p> <p>In seconds, the man slithered down the 20ft stone and retreated into the rain. The first and only real point of tension had passed and the early morning salesmen got back to working the crowds.</p> <p>\"Skunk truffles, trunk scuffles... \u00a31 a go... wibbly wobbly truffles anyone?\" Even the ancient order of HM constabulary, who could not have failed to have seen what was going on, or to have breathed deeply the billowing clouds of cannabis drifting in on the wild wind, had to laugh.</p> <p>That 6,000 people should want to walk miles to spend all night in the middle of a bleak wind and rain lashed moor to celebrate the invisible rising of a midsummer sun and get stoned out of their collective skull, never ceases to amaze tourists and middle England.</p> <p>But for those who have embraced romanticism, paganism and the many strands of druidism and the counter culture, the stones hold a symbolic and physical power of place.</p> <p>\"Scum and germs... remember your culture\", cried Helen, self-styled Lancastrian mistress of the night's ceremonies, dressed somewhere between Simon Bolivar and an Italian traffic cop - but with specs and a three foot horn which she blew frequently to the four winds.</p> <p>\"It's calm, just as it should be\", said Des, the mild - or perhaps stoned - Quest Knight and Battle Chieftain of the Loyal Arthurian Warband, parading a banner embroidered with the names of road protests of the last decade.</p> <p>\"It's a return to the spirit of the free festivals of the 1970s,\" said Tim Sebastian, whose title - Archdruid of Wiltshire, Chosen Chief of the Secular Order Of Druids, Conservation Officer for the Council Of British Druid Orders and Bard of the Gorsedd of Caer Abiri (Avebury) - defied any state-conferred nobility in its arcane absurdity. \"We are seeing a return to Celticity.\"</p> <p>Sebastian, a star in the druidic firmament, argues, controversially, druids should unite in \"brotherhood of love and peace\" and give up any pretence of high ritual or priesthood.</p> <p>\"That idea should have died with William Blake. Modern-day druids disclaim druidism from being a religion,\" he says.</p> <p>Where other druids had come garlanded in white and green, lugging antlers, staves and the paraphernalia of their cults, Sebastian had come as a jester and bearing mistletoe - the \"golden bough\" - to counteract, he said, the \"macho oakiness\" of the occasion. But like them, he had performed some rituals round the stones.</p> <p>Should the police, the bards or even New Labour want to award medals for gallantry and saving the day from being a potential battlefield, they should consider the bizarre Barking Balleria - a collection of up to 100 salsa players who acted as pied piper to the crowd.</p> <p>Made up of several different London groups, including students of anthropology at East London University and Reclaim the Streets, they were last seen leading the Mayday throng past the Cenotaph.</p> <p>Led by flaming torches and gals in bikinis, they alternately drummed, danced and ritually sang the crowd through the shortest night.

      "bodyText": "Somewhere around 4.20am, half an hour before sunrise, a semi-naked man clambered on top one of the great sarsens of Stonehenge and began inciting the crowd to follow him. In the spooky light and the driving rain, it was a gesture of defiance, a potential return to the 1970s when the Stonehenge free festival became an ugly battleground and the authorities responded by putting the stones off limits at the summer solstice for 15 years. The police - just a few on site but plenty more stashed round the Wiltshire lanes in case of trouble - held their breath. English Heritage, the government's site custodians who had gambled that the masses could police themselves, as they had argued for 15 years, crossed their fingers. The crowd of at least 6,000 - hippies, bards, students, locals, representatives of more than 30 druidical orders, horny road protesters, travellers, witches (white and black), teenagers, gents in robes and wings, the brew crew, resplendent knights of King Arthur's Round Table and a who's who of alternative England - just about stopped dancing to the relentless drums. The women were first on the case: \"Gerroff, yer silly bugger\", came the first cry from the middle of the stones. \"Stupid fucker... we'll never be allowed back,\" said another, dressed as a Queen of the Night. \"Idiot,\" said the third. In seconds, the man slithered down the 20ft stone and retreated into the rain. The first and only real point of tension had passed and the early morning salesmen got back to working the crowds. \"Skunk truffles, trunk scuffles... \u00a31 a go... wibbly wobbly truffles anyone?\" Even the ancient order of HM constabulary, who could not have failed to have seen what was going on, or to have breathed deeply the billowing clouds of cannabis drifting in on the wild wind, had to laugh. That 6,000 people should want to walk miles to spend all night in the middle of a bleak wind and rain lashed moor to celebrate the invisible rising of a midsummer sun and get stoned out of their collective skull, never ceases to amaze tourists and middle England. But for those who have embraced romanticism, paganism and the many strands of druidism and the counter culture, the stones hold a symbolic and physical power of place. \"Scum and germs... remember your culture\", cried Helen, self-styled Lancastrian mistress of the night's ceremonies, dressed somewhere between Simon Bolivar and an Italian traffic cop - but with specs and a three foot horn which she blew frequently to the four winds. \"It's calm, just as it should be\", said Des, the mild - or perhaps stoned - Quest Knight and Battle Chieftain of the Loyal Arthurian Warband, parading a banner embroidered with the names of road protests of the last decade. \"It's a return to the spirit of the free festivals of the 1970s,\" said Tim Sebastian, whose title - Archdruid of Wiltshire, Chosen Chief of the Secular Order Of Druids, Conservation Officer for the Council Of British Druid Orders and Bard of the Gorsedd of Caer Abiri (Avebury) - defied any state-conferred nobility in its arcane absurdity. \"We are seeing a return to Celticity.\" Sebastian, a star in the druidic firmament, argues, controversially, druids should unite in \"brotherhood of love and peace\" and give up any pretence of high ritual or priesthood. \"That idea should have died with William Blake. Modern-day druids disclaim druidism from being a religion,\" he says. Where other druids had come garlanded in white and green, lugging antlers, staves and the paraphernalia of their cults, Sebastian had come as a jester and bearing mistletoe - the \"golden bough\" - to counteract, he said, the \"macho oakiness\" of the occasion. But like them, he had performed some rituals round the stones. Should the police, the bards or even New Labour want to award medals for gallantry and saving the day from being a potential battlefield, they should consider the bizarre Barking Balleria - a collection of up to 100 salsa players who acted as pied piper to the crowd. Made up of several different London groups, including students of anthropology at East London University and Reclaim the Streets, they were last seen leading the Mayday throng past the Cenotaph. Led by flaming torches and gals in bikinis, they alternately drummed, danced and ritually sang the crowd through the shortest night. And crucially, as the official 7am deadline to leave the site approached, they led the crowd quietly back to the car park. \"Happy solstice,\" said one, conferring a huge smacker on a policeman. \"See you next year.\"",

Because what started as Jerry's Guide to the World-Wide Web - actually a pooling of links between Jerry and his friend David Filo - is called <a href=\"http://www.Yahoo.com\" target=\"_new\">Yahoo!</a>, and it's the most popular site on the net, with 145m users. </p> <p>Obviously some things have changed. Yahoo! has become a profitable multi-national corporation with subsidiaries in more than 20 countries and more than 2,000 staff. But the atmos phere in the UK offices, at least, can't be that far from the university trailer where the operation started. For example, there are gold stars stuck on the meeting room wall, and there's a bar-football table only a couple of feet from where we're talking. </p> <p>Yahoo!'s success has also made the softly-spoken Yang an icon for a net generation that believes that, with a bit of luck, anybody can make it. He was born in Taiwan in 1968, after his parents fled China, and his father died when he was two. His mother moved the family to San Jose when he was 10, and he had to learn the language from scratch. But he worked his way to the top of his high-school class and won a place at Stanford, one of the world's leading universities, and the heart of the Silicon Valley revolution. </p> <p>Unlike Bill Gates or Steve Jobs or even Jeff Bezos, who started Amazon, Yang didn't set out to become rich. Even after they'd started their web directory, Yang and Filo were still trying to think of a way to make money on the internet, rather than look for jobs in their field, computer-aided design. Yahoo! took off because it provided what users wanted, and the two young men were swept along in an adoring rush. Yang had started with nothing, and knew he could end up with nothing, but it promised to be an exhilarating ride. </p> <p>However, turning Yahoo! from a hobby into a company with venture capital backing, which Yang and Filo did in 1995, didn't mean they wanted to run it. They hired a professional chief executive, TK (Tim Koogle, interviewed in Online, September 30, 1999.) and a chief operating officer, Jeff Mallett. Yang became Chief Yahoo!, a mixture of business strategist, media spokesman and figurehead, while Filo, who sometimes styles himself Cheap Yahoo!, continued to work on the technical side. </p> <p>Since he's not motivated by money, Yang wasn't fazed by the collapse in dot.com share prices. \"We pay surprisingly little attention to the ups and downs of the stock market,\" he says, \"and I honestly think what's happened in the past six months has been extremely healthy, because it's separated the better companies from the bad companies, which don't deserve to be valued at high premiums. The separation of good and bad is always good for the leaders, and I think we're in that pack. It's made it easier for us to hire people, and from a partnering standpoint, people say: 'Do I want to partner with a dot.com I've never heard of or do I want to partner with Yahoo!, who'll still be around to yell at in two years time?' \" </p> <p>In the past five years, Yahoo! has hugely expanded its range of offerings, either by buying companies - <a href=\"http://www.GeoCities.com\" target=\"_new\">GeoCities</a> for its free home pages, <a href=\"http://www.Broadcast.com\" target=\"_new\">Broadcast.com</a> for streaming media - or by partnering with them, as with <a href=\"http://www.Reuters.com\" target=\"_new\">Reuters</a>, for its news feed. Yang points out that the directory and content services are now only one leg of the company's tripod, the others being communications (email, chatrooms, instant messaging etc) and e-commerce (shopping, classifieds, auctions etc). But the Yahoo! interface has stayed much the same: plain and fast. </p> <p>Reminding him of the Boo disaster, I ask if the secret is to stay behind the cutting edge. </p> <p>\"We say we don't like to be at the bleeding edge, because we don't like to bleed,\" he grins, swinging round in his chair. \"But we like to be at the leading edge, introducing services using technologies that can be exposed to millions of our users, rather than a smaller subset. </p> <p>\"The internet is a very rough environment, as you know, so unless something's pretty battle-tested, we tend not to put it out there.

It is the middle of the afternoon, and although they moved into the premises only four months ago, the phones are weirdly silent. </p> <p>Three abandoned iMacs sit at empty desks in the room next door. Last Tuesday, the bullet suspended day-to-day maintenance of its three media websites to pursue what they call \"new business opportunities\". Three recently recruited staff were, very reluctantly, made redundant. </p> <p>Only six months ago, Monroe and Billam were mentioned in Online as one of the bright prospects in dot.coms. They were riding high on the back of a valuation that priced their small internet company at \u00a32m. It might sound a lot, but the pair had quickly cottoned on to what was then a virgin market of a daily news site catering for the TV industry. Pitching themselves as a \"guerrilla force in UK media\", they quickly developed an audience of key media executives that made them extremely lucrative to online advertisers. </p> <p>But the last six months have proved a very, very long time for the e-conomy. They are learning the hard lesson that fortunes can fall just as quickly as they rise. Monroe says: \"It really wasn't nice and it wasn't clever and I am ashamed of the fact that I have given people jobs and literally within months, I've had to take them away.\" </p> <p>A month ago it was looking so good. The-bullet had just celebrated the launch of its third website. They had also hosted a handful of networking parties and ad revenue had increased significantly. </p> <p>The pair insist that this is not another <a href=\"http://www.Boo.com\" target=\"_new\">Boo.com</a>; they haven't run out of money and are not about to file for bankcruptcy. Rather, they decided to take some very tough decisions about how to make a profit in the future. They say enough remains in the bank to operate until the end of the year and there are no immediate plans to vacate the offices in Old Street. </p> <p> Since February, they had attracted an undisclosed amount of seed capital from a private investor, Tom Singh, of First Choice clothing group. This allowed The-bullet to expand and, for the first time, begin paying themselves a wage. They recruited quickly, poaching staff from Media Week and UK Press Gazette. </p> <p>Monroe says: \"Seed financing lets you get used to spending pretty large sums - ie five salaries, office costs, phone bills and other people's expenses. But it also forces you to be cautious. Now we've learnt how to spend money I don't think we'd be overawed by paying 20, or 50 salaries because we understand what you get for your money. </p> <p>\"Whereas if we'd been given \u00a31m straight off I think it would have all been too much like playing Monopoly.\" </p> <p>They are tight-lipped about their plans, although they stress that the website will only be one of many revenue streams. </p> <p>What advice would they give to other dot.coms? Billam says: \"The main thing is don't expect too much from other people and expect everything to take twice as long as you planned. Keep a close eye on what everyone is doing, and if you do trustpeople to do things for you, make sure you have got goals, and assess their progress. Also don't be afraid to question the experts.\" </p> <p>\"Yes,\" says Monroe, \"because if we'd been clued up about business and finance at the launch, I think we'd be in a very strong position by now. But the upside is that it gave us a long time to get to know our product and our market - and I think that counted for a lot of our success. We lost a lot of 'first mover advantage' because we couldn't move quickly enough. It was also very, very hard being that skint for that long.\" </p> <p>So The-bullet will definitely be having another shot at it. Next time a little tougher and a lot wiser. The websites are still live, and they will be adding new content. </p> <p>The statement on their website simply reads more like a declaration that an epitaph: \"We have not been shot dead, run out of ammo or bitten the bullet, but thanks for the headlines anyway.\" </p> <p>But a message on a <a href=\"http://www.chinwag.com/uk-netmarketing\">Chinwag talkboard</a> read: \"I really must say that The-bullet was second string in many ways (sorry guys) so again, it is far from a 'death knell for the industry'. Rather, it is a warning to all those who would try and profit from a poorly realised and/or shabbily executed concept.\" </p> <p>While, Kris Jones, head of public affairs at Pact, a leading trade association for UK independent television, film and new media companies said: \"It didn't always have a good enough grasp of the issues and I didn't find it a useful service. I guess its problem is that it is competing against sites that have much greater resources, and although it is a bold venture, I think it launched in a very difficult marketplace.\"</p>",

This allowed The-bullet to expand and, for the first time, begin paying themselves a wage. They recruited quickly, poaching staff from Media Week and UK Press Gazette. Monroe says: \"Seed financing lets you get used to spending pretty large sums - ie five salaries, office costs, phone bills and other people's expenses. But it also forces you to be cautious. Now we've learnt how to spend money I don't think we'd be overawed by paying 20, or 50 salaries because we understand what you get for your money. \"Whereas if we'd been given \u00a31m straight off I think it would have all been too much like playing Monopoly.\" They are tight-lipped about their plans, although they stress that the website will only be one of many revenue streams. What advice would they give to other dot.coms? Billam says: \"The main thing is don't expect too much from other people and expect everything to take twice as long as you planned. Keep a close eye on what everyone is doing, and if you do trustpeople to do things for you, make sure you have got goals, and assess their progress. Also don't be afraid to question the experts.\" \"Yes,\" says Monroe, \"because if we'd been clued up about business and finance at the launch, I think we'd be in a very strong position by now. But the upside is that it gave us a long time to get to know our product and our market - and I think that counted for a lot of our success. We lost a lot of 'first mover advantage' because we couldn't move quickly enough. It was also very, very hard being that skint for that long.\" So The-bullet will definitely be having another shot at it. Next time a little tougher and a lot wiser. The websites are still live, and they will be adding new content. The statement on their website simply reads more like a declaration that an epitaph: \"We have not been shot dead, run out of ammo or bitten the bullet, but thanks for the headlines anyway.\" But a message on a Chinwag talkboard read: \"I really must say that The-bullet was second string in many ways (sorry guys) so again, it is far from a 'death knell for the industry'. Rather, it is a warning to all those who would try and profit from a poorly realised and/or shabbily executed concept.\" While, Kris Jones, head of public affairs at Pact, a leading trade association for UK independent television, film and new media companies said: \"It didn't always have a good enough grasp of the issues and I didn't find it a useful service. I guess its problem is that it is competing against sites that have much greater resources, and although it is a bold venture, I think it launched in a very difficult marketplace.\"",

      "body": "<p>The other week I went to London to visit Tate Modern. Two days later my head was reeling with the innovative juxtaposition of art, such as Brontosaurus (naked man filmed by a woman dancing to house, redubbed with Adagio For Strings) next to Bust of a Woman (naked woman painted by well-known male artist). The scale of some pieces, such as Louise Bourgeois's steel spider, and her towers of doing and undoing, is overwhelming, as is the sheer volume of art. By the end of day two I still hadn't seen everything in the art gallery much less chilled out in the chill corners. </p> <p>As I don't get to London all that often, I wondered if it would be possible to view the rest of the Tate's collection from my PC, drinking suitably strong expressos in lieu of the ones they weren't selling in the Tate. <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/modern/\">The Tate's website</a> is nicely laid out and gives you a guide to what is on in each gallery and one image of one work of art in that section. </p> <p>There is a search facility for all the Tates combined: there are 48 Picassos for instance, 19 of which have digital images; 12 of them (including Bust Of A Woman) are on display. But it's not quite the same as walking round the gallery and seeing what else is in the Naked/Nude gallery. </p> <p>Like the Tate, the <a href=\"http://www.uffizi.firenze.it/welcomeE.html\">Uffizi</a> in Florence is a bit of a list as to what is on and where.

      "bodyText": "The other week I went to London to visit Tate Modern. Two days later my head was reeling with the innovative juxtaposition of art, such as Brontosaurus (naked man filmed by a woman dancing to house, redubbed with Adagio For Strings) next to Bust of a Woman (naked woman painted by well-known male artist). The scale of some pieces, such as Louise Bourgeois's steel spider, and her towers of doing and undoing, is overwhelming, as is the sheer volume of art. By the end of day two I still hadn't seen everything in the art gallery much less chilled out in the chill corners. As I don't get to London all that often, I wondered if it would be possible to view the rest of the Tate's collection from my PC, drinking suitably strong expressos in lieu of the ones they weren't selling in the Tate. The Tate's website is nicely laid out and gives you a guide to what is on in each gallery and one image of one work of art in that section. There is a search facility for all the Tates combined: there are 48 Picassos for instance, 19 of which have digital images; 12 of them (including Bust Of A Woman) are on display. But it's not quite the same as walking round the gallery and seeing what else is in the Naked/Nude gallery. Like the Tate, the Uffizi in Florence is a bit of a list as to what is on and where. Also you have to squint at the few pictures they do show as they are tiny. Rather more forthcoming was the Museo del Prado which does allow you to browse a number of its works of art online. The quality of the images is also excellent: one in particular struck me, a painting by Joaqu\u00edn Sorolla Y Bastida called Children At The Beach.

      "body": "<p><strong> Colour call</strong><br> If you like surprises, you're sure to be charmed by the latest mobile phone in Motorola's Timeport series. The T250's unique feature is that it glows one of three different colours depending on who's calling. It can be programmed so that for example a business call can cause the screen to glow yellow, a friend on the line will turn it a shade of blue while anonymous callers will send the screen green. The phone also features a Wap browser, an apparently improved user interface and a couple of new games. </p> <p>Motorola has also been giving sneak previews of products it may or may not bring to the UK next year. </p> <p>Among its latest prototypes is the Accompli A6188, or the Tai Chai, to give its slightly funkier title. It's essentially a touch-screen personal organiser that's been paired with a Wap phone. So in addition to sending emails and finding out the latest football news you can store addresses, make appointments and generally keep yourself up to speed. If it does make it to the UK it will retail for around \u00a3250. </p> <p><strong> Small view</strong><br> Canon has launched what it is billing as \"the smallest and lightest digital camera in the world\". The Digital Ixus is a 2.1 Megapixel model that you can virtually hide behind your credit card. </p> <p>Among its facilities are a 4x zoom, a range of intelligent focusing features and a mode that helps the user shoot seamless panoramic pictures. The Ixus uses CompactFlash memory cards. </p> <p><strong> Screen gem </strong><br> Even manufacturers as innovative as Sony understand that sometimes \"if you can't beat 'em, join 'em\". For the Japanese giant has unveiled the first of its Pocket Cinema products, a personal DVD player complete with LCD screen that's not unlike one of last year's most coveted gadgets - Panasonic's DVD-L50. </p> <p>Sony's version, the \u00a31,200 DVP-FX1, pairs a very sleek DVD player with a 7in wide LCD screen. It has the usual DVD widgets - trick play, on-screen prompts - but also features an option that apparently delivers surround sound via its accompanying headphones. </p> <p>Not to be outdone, Panasonic has released its latest portable DVD player, the DVD-LV75, which it claims is the smallest and lightest of its kind. In spite of its size, the player features a 7in widescreen LCD monitor and Dolby Digital and DTS (Digital Theater Sound) surround sound decoders. Just like the Sony, it too sports a \u00a31200 price tag. </p> <p><strong> Extra high fi</strong><br> Hi-fi fans who feel short-changed by the CD format - it apparently has a rather limited bandwidth and is missing little chunks at either end of the frequency spectrum - will be cheered this week by news from Philips and Marantz. Both companies have decided to join Sony in championing the SACD (Super Audio CD) format. SACD offers significantly higher frequency capability and wider dynamic range than standard audio CDs. It also delivers multi-channel music, and has much in common with the DVD-audio format soon to be launched by Panasonic, JVC and others. The SACD group claims to deliver superior sound reproduction to DVD-Audio through the use of DSD (Direct Stream Digital) technology. </p> <p>The Marantz model, the SA-1, is a stereo-only player due to go on sale later in the year. It will be followed by the Philips SACD1000 which will also play back DVD-video discs in addition to the 200 or so audio SACD discs now on sale. </p> <p>Philips is also hoping to cement its position as number one in the hi-fi CD-recorder with a trio of new models. Top billing goes to the CDR-785 which sports a three-disc playback changer designed to speed up the process of making compilation CDs.

      "bodyText": "Colour call If you like surprises, you're sure to be charmed by the latest mobile phone in Motorola's Timeport series. The T250's unique feature is that it glows one of three different colours depending on who's calling. It can be programmed so that for example a business call can cause the screen to glow yellow, a friend on the line will turn it a shade of blue while anonymous callers will send the screen green. The phone also features a Wap browser, an apparently improved user interface and a couple of new games. Motorola has also been giving sneak previews of products it may or may not bring to the UK next year. Among its latest prototypes is the Accompli A6188, or the Tai Chai, to give its slightly funkier title. It's essentially a touch-screen personal organiser that's been paired with a Wap phone. So in addition to sending emails and finding out the latest football news you can store addresses, make appointments and generally keep yourself up to speed. If it does make it to the UK it will retail for around \u00a3250. Small view Canon has launched what it is billing as \"the smallest and lightest digital camera in the world\". The Digital Ixus is a 2.1 Megapixel model that you can virtually hide behind your credit card. Among its facilities are a 4x zoom, a range of intelligent focusing features and a mode that helps the user shoot seamless panoramic pictures. The Ixus uses CompactFlash memory cards. Screen gem Even manufacturers as innovative as Sony understand that sometimes \"if you can't beat 'em, join 'em\". For the Japanese giant has unveiled the first of its Pocket Cinema products, a personal DVD player complete with LCD screen that's not unlike one of last year's most coveted gadgets - Panasonic's DVD-L50. Sony's version, the \u00a31,200 DVP-FX1, pairs a very sleek DVD player with a 7in wide LCD screen. It has the usual DVD widgets - trick play, on-screen prompts - but also features an option that apparently delivers surround sound via its accompanying headphones. Not to be outdone, Panasonic has released its latest portable DVD player, the DVD-LV75, which it claims is the smallest and lightest of its kind. In spite of its size, the player features a 7in widescreen LCD monitor and Dolby Digital and DTS (Digital Theater Sound) surround sound decoders. Just like the Sony, it too sports a \u00a31200 price tag. Extra high fi Hi-fi fans who feel short-changed by the CD format - it apparently has a rather limited bandwidth and is missing little chunks at either end of the frequency spectrum - will be cheered this week by news from Philips and Marantz. Both companies have decided to join Sony in championing the SACD (Super Audio CD) format. SACD offers significantly higher frequency capability and wider dynamic range than standard audio CDs. It also delivers multi-channel music, and has much in common with the DVD-audio format soon to be launched by Panasonic, JVC and others. The SACD group claims to deliver superior sound reproduction to DVD-Audio through the use of DSD (Direct Stream Digital) technology. The Marantz model, the SA-1, is a stereo-only player due to go on sale later in the year. It will be followed by the Philips SACD1000 which will also play back DVD-video discs in addition to the 200 or so audio SACD discs now on sale. Philips is also hoping to cement its position as number one in the hi-fi CD-recorder with a trio of new models. Top billing goes to the CDR-785 which sports a three-disc playback changer designed to speed up the process of making compilation CDs.

It carries updates to the Food List - a list of gluten-free products which can be eaten by sufferers of this very painful condition. I have been accustomed with the help of Netmind notification to download these updates within a few hours of their release. The entire site has now been updated to use Macromedia Flash, with no alternative for those who don't want to download the plugin. I can't Netmind the page, and what used to take seconds now takes minutes, even on an ISDN connection. It is very poor design not to offer a straight HTML alternative. Steve Annells annells@annells.worldonline.co.uk Lost chance One of the important events on the internet in the last few months was Amazon getting a patent on One-Click ordering. Because of the ramifications of this action, a large number of people have been boycotting Amazon (see www.nowebpatents.org or www.noamazon.com for details). Ashley Norris's interview with Jeff Bezos would have been a good opportunity to challenge Amazon on this action and to hear their response. It's a shame, therefore, that all we got was a corporate puff piece on what a nice bloke Bezos is and how successful Amazon is. Dave Cross dave@dave.org.uk Break free Yes, Microsoft does have an effective monopoly on operating systems. We know the problems this brings, and the (current) limitations of the alternatives. But MS does not have a monopoly on word-processing, spreadsheets, databases, desktop publishing programs (DTP) and the like. Why do so many people complain about Microsoft's stranglehold and then hand their monopoly to them on a plate? It is possible to live/run a business without MS Office. Bill Blackledge (address supplied) Bounce back Of course my PC crashes... but I discovered that by pressing Ctrl-Alt-Delete and selecting RNAAPP (it is always there when my pc crashes) in the list of programs my PC springs back to life. I don't know whether this is a panacea but believe me when I say it has changed my life: I haven't lost a day's work since. Simon Harding sales@theatrebreaks.com Jack Schofield replies: RNAAPP is the Remote Network Access Application (part of Windows' Dial Up Networking). It sometimes sticks in memory from an earlier connection, and may cause a later connection to fail. Whenever you get the message to say that \"Dial-up Networking could not establish a compatible set of network protocols\" or something similar, press Ctrl-Alt-Delete, find RNAAPP in the task list, select it, and then click on the End Task button.",

      "body": "<p>Bioinformatics is the science of life as a software problem. An international co-operation called the Human Genome Project is about to finish putting the human DNA blueprint on the internet. </p> <p>And a team working closely with them is about to distribute a software package that will turn the world of biology into a co-operative research laboratory. The exploration of the human software will become a kind of global interactive game, with a new tool called Ensembl. </p> <p>Consider the problem. DNA is an alphabet of four chemical letters, known as A, C, G and T. The genes are \"written\" in this language. The catch is that human genes are huge and sprawling (some of them more than a million characters). </p> <p>The other catch is that most of the human DNA alphabet is impolitely known as \"junk\". It must have meant something once, it must tell some kind of evolutionary story, but as far as gene hunters are concerned, it is junk. The catch is, it looks exactly like the stuff that spells out the genes. </p> <p>So the game is to find an unknown number of genes - there could be 40,000, there could be 140,000 and bioinformaticians have a sweepstake going - concealed in 3 billion letters of cryptic alphabet called human DNA. That is why Tim Hubbard and colleagues at the Wellcome Genome Campus in Cambridge - the site of the Sanger Centre where the DNA sequence is being transcribed at a rate of millions of characters a day - came up with Ensembl. </p> <p>It looks like an anagram. The name is a concealed pun on the initials of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory, one of the partners in the enterprise. But Ensembl is information technology's answer to a once-unimaginable challenge. </p> <p>A 3bn letter blueprint written in four letters sets challenges that would make an ordinary espionage code-cracker reach for the whisky bottle. \"I worked out that if you close-typed it on an A4 page, it would be three quarters of a million pages stacked on top of each other,\" says Dr Hubbard. \"That's what we have now. It looks bad, just looking at one page of ACTG, but that is the size of the thing we have got to deal with. It's big.\" </p> <p>Genes carry the instructions to assemble proteins out of amino acids. The command for one amino acid occurs in a \"codon\", a group of three letters. It's a start: something to look for. But the raw data is just that - unrefined. </p> <p>Suppose somebody does decipher a secret message in a long string of the four letters A, C, G and T, grouped into triplets of three, somewhere in those 750,000 A4 pages? And then the information gets refined, missing bits get inserted, passages get corrected, the punctuation gets changed? Could you find the passage again, given that it is written in four letters, in a book containing only four letters? To add to the confusion many, if not most, genes are written in instalments in those four letters, interrupted by long passages of junk, also written in the same four letters. </p> <p>\"We had to think about how to deal with that,\" says Dr Hubbard. \"The difficulty with dealing with the unfinished sequence is that it keeps changing. But where you have identified a gene, you want to keep track of that as the sequences change underneath. That is actually technically messy.\" </p> <p>Ensembl searches the data, looks for what might be genes, marks the passages in the book of the human that tell a coherent story, and then keeps note of them. It does so first of all by a method called ab initio. A group of three letters will spell out the commands for an amino acid. A series of such three letter codons will spell out all the commands to make a whole protein. Somewhere at the beginning will be a kind of instruction manual: a kind of control panel for the whole gene. At the end there will be some kind of full stop. </p> <p>In between the bits of gene there will be stutters that say \"there will now be a short intermission\" and after an interval of meaningless alphabet, another bit that says, \"I will now take up the story again\". All of this is there, in the code, told in three letter codons. The catch is that DNA doesn't print out neatly in neat groups CGA and GAT and GCG. It just goes GATTACCATACCAGAT for a whole chromosome. </p> <p>So Ensembl has to break the whole text up into three letter words and stare at them to see if any of them make sense, and then shift each letter along one into another book of three letter words, and so on, until suddenly, it starts seeing sentences that seem to mean something. If so, it's probably a gene. </p> <p>But a string of letters doesn't mean anything. So Ensembl now does more than that. It looks at other books in the library of life, the book of yeast and fruitfly and nematode worm, for instance, and the books of the bacteria, all of them written in the same four letters of DNA, and does a bit of comparative literature. </p> <p>The great thing about yeast and bacteria and nematode worms is that the genes are much more tidily written and strung close to each other, like a rope of pearls. The other great thing about yeast and bacteria and nematodes is that they are related to each other, and to humans. </p> <p>Baker's yeast contains genes which in humans - if there are transcriptions errors - lead to breast cancer, or colorectal cancer. Nematode worms have genes which dictate whether their lives are short and merry, or long and serene; humans have very similar genes. </p> <p>Nature is conservative: life began with one organism and one set of genetic tools and 3.8bn years of evolution and speciation later, is still using them. Genes mutate across the generations, nature selects the ones that happen to fit the environment and discards the rest. It is the machinery of evolution. </p> <p>So some of the things that worked for trilobites or dinosaurs or mammoths are still going to be working for titmice, dachshunds and merchant bankers. Find a gene in one organism, and it will be easier to recognise in another. </p> <p>\"You can find a lot that way,\" Dr Hubbard says. \"We are quite highly related to the ancestor of bacteria. The bigger problem is that the genes might be the same but they may have mutated in some way that makes it impossible to find the similarity any more.\" </p> <p>So the next trick is to complete the laboratory mouse genome, or the genome of the zebra fish (pictured), and use them to do some comparison, because both are vertebrates, and one of them is a mammal. As relatives go, that is pretty close. Ensembl will not just compare the books of life, it will compare books in the same genre to get ever better answers. </p> <p>And then there is a third approach: look at the catalogue. Start using DNA's own command system to find the answers. \"You take the cells of your chosen organism, and you smash them up and take out the messenger RNA, the thing you are going to use to make the proteins, and you sequence that instead. That is the so-called EST, the express sequence transcript. You can build up a whole library of those, little fragments that you know are genes, and you can search those against your genomic sequence.\" </p> <p>So far, so difficult. Last year, Sanger scientists finished the sequence of chromosome 22. They announced a total of 540 genes and then added a caveat: maybe there were another 100 or so lurking in the thickets of impenetrable prose. And chromosome 22 is only 1.4% of the whole book of life. The exercise is beyond any one group. The bureaucracy of trying to keep track of worldwide research on this one set of data would drive strong men mad. That is why the Ensembl team are working on the next neat trick. They are preparing a package that anybody can use: a game that any geneticist or biologist, anywhere, can play. The idea is that biologists in Bogota can annotate the information about breast cancer genes, and geneticists in Geneva can block it out because they want only to look at genes that govern geriatric factors. </p> <p>\"The idea is that rather than having one central authority, where you have problems with politics, persuading people that your stuff is worthwhile including, where somebody else's might not be, you don't have to have that any more,\"says Dr Hubbard. \"Anybody can set up their own little site. And this is now a question of software engineering: all of those little sites communicate with the central one automatically, so that all the co-ordinates are matched. Anybody can provide information, anybody can be a receiver. It still isn't quite possible yet,\" he says. </p> <p>He sees it as working like Linux, but on top of the source code, there's the bonus of lots of information flowing back. </p> <p>\"We intend to provide a complete package so that biologists with very little knowledge will be able to download a package, set up on a Mac in a corner, and just add little bits of information if they think they have something to contribute.\" </p> <p>There is a long way to go. Ensembl is just a beginning. \"These methods are a huge amount better than nothing at all, but they are not perfect,\" Dr Hubbard says. \"It is the same for everybody. Nobody has a secret weapon for this.\" </p> <p> To learn more about Ensembl visit <a href=\"http://www.ensembl.org  \">www.ensembl.org</a> </p> <p><strong> The trouble with tribbles</strong><br> Biologists discover genes, name them, then discover what they do.

      "body": "<p>And so the \"historic victory\" over Germany came to be seen for what it was: a battle between two wounded and worn-out tigers, in which the winner was the one with the most teeth left in its head. </p> <p>When confronted in their other matches by sides full of youth, vigour, ideas and purpose, England were exposed as the no-hopers they truly are. Only in the decrepit Germans did they find an opponent whose powers were even more thoroughly atrophied. </p> <p>Well, the rebuilding had better start here, although whether England have the planners and engineers required to carry out the job is another matter. Kevin Keegan will continue to lead the squad into the qualifying campaign for the 2002 World Cup and the nation can only hope that he and his employers have learnt the hard and painfully obvious lessons of the last few days. </p> <p>Although England's football community will briefly echo with self-criticism and mutual recrimination, the real enemy is the much deeper sense of self-satisfaction. Wembley will be full for the Charity Shield, BSkyB will run its vainglorious trailers in the countdown to the Premiership kick-off, and all will be well once again the soi-disant \"greatest league in the world\". Vast salaries will continue to be paid from the proceeds of ludicrously inflated television contracts, the marketing men will fill the hospitality boxes, and the cheap perfume of all-round prosperity will once again disguise the stench arising from the rotting fibres of the national game. </p> <p>That game is embodied in its players, which is to say its ever-diminishing number of English players, and particularly the young ones. The foreign stars are welcome guests, but they are not English football. Thanks to the cultural irresponsibility of men like Ken Bates of Chelsea and David Dein of Arsenal, the presence of so many foreign footballers has turned the Premiership into a circus, a gaudy entertainment far removed not only from its own roots but even from the formative environments of those newcomers who are arriving almost daily in the great footballing transmigration. </p> <p>In a fascinating and provocative interview with L'Equipe this week Ars\u00e8ne Wenger spoke of how, after growing up as a French football fan in Alsace, just across the border from Germany, he still has to pinch himself to make sure he is not dreaming when he realises that the old inferiority complex has been consigned to history. </p> <p>\"In Germany,\" he said, \"five million people are licensed to play, but they have no players. Five million people playing football, and they still have to pick a 39-year-old. So you can see the problem right there.\" </p> <p>French football, he said, is now \"five to 10 years ahead\" of the rest of the world, thanks to a carefully planned and rigorously controlled programme of national selection and coaching, in which the national federation not only forced professional clubs to create what we know as centres of excellence but also set up residential schools of their own - principally the famous institute at Clairfontaine, from which Thierry Henry and Nicolas Anelka emerged. </p> <p>Henry and Anelka are the children of immigrants, brought up in the suburbs of Paris. Wenger, who has managed both men at club level, certainly had them in mind when he spoke - in terms that few would dare to use in England - of the special value of players drawn from France's black minorities. Since the World Cup triumph of 1998 the team's ethnic variety has been used as a symbol of a new and more enlightened version of Frenchness, but symbolism was not what was on Wenger's mind. His point was about their value as athletes. </p> <p>\"The make-up of the national team benefits from the variety of ethnic origins of the players,\" he said. \"For example, our black players have special qualities. I think black sportsmen have a certain advantage, and in football it shows itself in an explosive speed. You can't contradict that when you look at Anelka, Henry and [Sylvain] Wiltord. And that bit is genetic. The rest is culture and education. But the genetic bit can't be added. Not yet, anyway.\" </p> <p>Britain is no less fortunate than France in the existence of a pool of immigrant communities. But have our coaches identified and exploited the unique attribute of \"explosive speed\" noted by Wenger? With the single exception of John Barnes, a product of the Jamaican middle class, our internationally successful black players - such as Viv Anderson, Sol Campbell, Paul Ince and now Emile Heskey - have been chosen on the basis of other virtues, virtues which do not differentiate them from their white counterparts, including an appetite for trench warfare.

      "bodyText": "And so the \"historic victory\" over Germany came to be seen for what it was: a battle between two wounded and worn-out tigers, in which the winner was the one with the most teeth left in its head. When confronted in their other matches by sides full of youth, vigour, ideas and purpose, England were exposed as the no-hopers they truly are. Only in the decrepit Germans did they find an opponent whose powers were even more thoroughly atrophied. Well, the rebuilding had better start here, although whether England have the planners and engineers required to carry out the job is another matter. Kevin Keegan will continue to lead the squad into the qualifying campaign for the 2002 World Cup and the nation can only hope that he and his employers have learnt the hard and painfully obvious lessons of the last few days. Although England's football community will briefly echo with self-criticism and mutual recrimination, the real enemy is the much deeper sense of self-satisfaction. Wembley will be full for the Charity Shield, BSkyB will run its vainglorious trailers in the countdown to the Premiership kick-off, and all will be well once again the soi-disant \"greatest league in the world\". Vast salaries will continue to be paid from the proceeds of ludicrously inflated television contracts, the marketing men will fill the hospitality boxes, and the cheap perfume of all-round prosperity will once again disguise the stench arising from the rotting fibres of the national game. That game is embodied in its players, which is to say its ever-diminishing number of English players, and particularly the young ones. The foreign stars are welcome guests, but they are not English football. Thanks to the cultural irresponsibility of men like Ken Bates of Chelsea and David Dein of Arsenal, the presence of so many foreign footballers has turned the Premiership into a circus, a gaudy entertainment far removed not only from its own roots but even from the formative environments of those newcomers who are arriving almost daily in the great footballing transmigration. In a fascinating and provocative interview with L'Equipe this week Ars\u00e8ne Wenger spoke of how, after growing up as a French football fan in Alsace, just across the border from Germany, he still has to pinch himself to make sure he is not dreaming when he realises that the old inferiority complex has been consigned to history. \"In Germany,\" he said, \"five million people are licensed to play, but they have no players. Five million people playing football, and they still have to pick a 39-year-old. So you can see the problem right there.\" French football, he said, is now \"five to 10 years ahead\" of the rest of the world, thanks to a carefully planned and rigorously controlled programme of national selection and coaching, in which the national federation not only forced professional clubs to create what we know as centres of excellence but also set up residential schools of their own - principally the famous institute at Clairfontaine, from which Thierry Henry and Nicolas Anelka emerged. Henry and Anelka are the children of immigrants, brought up in the suburbs of Paris. Wenger, who has managed both men at club level, certainly had them in mind when he spoke - in terms that few would dare to use in England - of the special value of players drawn from France's black minorities. Since the World Cup triumph of 1998 the team's ethnic variety has been used as a symbol of a new and more enlightened version of Frenchness, but symbolism was not what was on Wenger's mind. His point was about their value as athletes. \"The make-up of the national team benefits from the variety of ethnic origins of the players,\" he said. \"For example, our black players have special qualities. I think black sportsmen have a certain advantage, and in football it shows itself in an explosive speed. You can't contradict that when you look at Anelka, Henry and [Sylvain] Wiltord. And that bit is genetic. The rest is culture and education. But the genetic bit can't be added. Not yet, anyway.\" Britain is no less fortunate than France in the existence of a pool of immigrant communities. But have our coaches identified and exploited the unique attribute of \"explosive speed\" noted by Wenger? With the single exception of John Barnes, a product of the Jamaican middle class, our internationally successful black players - such as Viv Anderson, Sol Campbell, Paul Ince and now Emile Heskey - have been chosen on the basis of other virtues, virtues which do not differentiate them from their white counterparts, including an appetite for trench warfare. Our \"explosive speedsters\", from Laurie Cunningham through Franz Carr and the Wallace brothers to Mark Walters and Tony Daley, have not in general been nurtured within a culture of trust and encouragement. Maybe that's a good place to start, a place to spend some of the tens of millions of pounds flooding in from those who want to exploit a commercial relationship with the game of 22 men and a ball. Maybe it's time, as we say goodbye to the international careers of Alan Shearer, Tony Adams, Martin Keown, David Seaman, Paul Ince, Dennis Wise and a few others besides, to take some really meaningful steps to re-establish the supply of talented young players available to wear the white shirt. The old concept of the Football Association school at Lilleshall, which was closed down because the clubs resented having talented youngsters taken out of their hands, needs resurrecting. And we need not one Lilleshall but a dozen, taking boys from around the country and giving them \"culture and education\". Does Adam Crozier, the former advertising man who is now the chief executive of the Football Association, have the vision to create such a scheme, and the strength to bully the likes of Bates and Dein into accepting it? Or is football now so much a pale imitation of New Labour that presentation is the only virtue? Wenger, of course, is not entirely without guilt. At Arsenal, under Liam Brady's care, more than one generation of young players is kicking its heels, waiting its turn while the manager buys veterans from Ukraine, from Croatia, from France. He wants to win the European Cup, but the price of his success, and Chelsea's, and soon maybe even Manchester United's, is too high. Dein, Bates and Martin Edwards must recognise their part in England's Euro 2000 debacle. They need to be told that they have a responsibility not just to providing immediate satisfaction for the holders of their shares and their season tickets but to the long-term growth of the game on whose profits they have grown fat. Altruism and professional football are further apart now than they have ever been - but the wider the gap is allowed to grow, the harder Kevin Keegan's job becomes.
