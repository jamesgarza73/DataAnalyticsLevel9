      "bodyText": "Dairy Crest has just become Britain's largest dairy company - but \"milk\" seems to be a taboo word around the business. As the group announced a \u00a31m fall in annual pre-tax profits to \u00a344m, the only things the management wanted to talk about were butter, cheese and yoghurt. The chief executive of Dairy Crest, John Houliston, is still basking in the success of winning a fierce bidding battle with Robert Wiseman Dairies to snatch Unigate's milk and cheese businesses for \u00a3250m last month. That deal has sparked a 20% revival in the value of the company's shares. The acquisition means Dairy Crest processes a quarter of Britain's entire milk production, with more than 9,000 employees in 23 factories. The only problem is that milk is a declining industry - Britons have been buying less and less for years. So Mr Houliston prefers to dwell on Clover spreads, stilton cheese and Petits Filous desserts - which are growing, albeit at rather meagre, single-digit levels. Dairy Crest has some decent brands - Cathedral City cheddar, for instance, managed 20% growth in volume sales in a market which expanded just 1%. Clover is doing well as a happy medium between \"unhealthy\" butter and low-fat spreads. However, the bulk of the business still revolves around selling billions of litres of milk. Instead of getting a pint from the milkman every day, Britons have switched to buying several pints a week from the local supermarket. The dairy industry has been in no state to respond to this problem, having been through big changes with the break-up of the Milk Marque co-operative. This summer, however, the industry is planning to begin a major advertising campaign promoting the virtues of milk. But this is unlikely to be enough to inject much excitement into the sector - Dairy Crest's shares slipped 5.5p to 177.5p yesterday.",

      "body": "<p>Yet another internet bank will take to the small screen this weekend as the race for cyberspace banking customers gathers pace. This time the advertiser will be Cahoot, Abbey National's internet venture which aims not to be just a bank but also a shopping experience. </p> <p>Last night, ahead of Monday's launch, Cahoot was being coy about the interest rates it would offer other than to say that the rates would be customised for customers. </p> <p>The key to the idea is to be low cost - it employs just 56 staff - and grab a 5% share of the internet banking market by 2003. At about the same time it should start to make a profit. Abbey spent \u00a350m on Cahoot last year, as well as \u00a330m on its own-brand internet bank and a further \u00a320m on various online projects. </p> <p>Its own-branded retail internet bank, launched four weeks ago, is already claiming to have 120,000 customers, putting it on track for 1m customers in 12 months. </p> <p>Abbey yesterday tried to impress the City with its next generation of e-credentials by announcing a mobile phone deal with Carphone Warehouse and <a href=\"http://www.orange.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">Orange</a>. </p> <p>It also wants to be big in the world of digital TV, where it sets itself the target to be the dominant player. In a sad reflection of the TV viewer, the first 75,000 or so registrations for digital banking show that most activity takes place at 7.59pm each evening, the gap between Coronation Street and The Bill. </p> <p>As with its closest rival the Halifax, the internet is also the avenue for Abbey to try to break into the business of banking to small businesses, where the dominance of the \"big four\" is already being investigated by the competition commission. </p> <p>But despite all the hype surrounding yesterday's announcements, the City was left cold as Abbey's shares drifted down 5% to 867.5p. </p> <p>One thing that did emerge from yesterday's presentations is the fact that by getting customers to use the net, Abbey can manage accounts at 60% of the cost of traditional equivalents in branches. That kind of statistic is likely to be true for all the banks, and it remains to be seen whether they will pass the lower costs on their customers or please the City by boosting their profits.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Yet another internet bank will take to the small screen this weekend as the race for cyberspace banking customers gathers pace. This time the advertiser will be Cahoot, Abbey National's internet venture which aims not to be just a bank but also a shopping experience. Last night, ahead of Monday's launch, Cahoot was being coy about the interest rates it would offer other than to say that the rates would be customised for customers. The key to the idea is to be low cost - it employs just 56 staff - and grab a 5% share of the internet banking market by 2003. At about the same time it should start to make a profit. Abbey spent \u00a350m on Cahoot last year, as well as \u00a330m on its own-brand internet bank and a further \u00a320m on various online projects. Its own-branded retail internet bank, launched four weeks ago, is already claiming to have 120,000 customers, putting it on track for 1m customers in 12 months. Abbey yesterday tried to impress the City with its next generation of e-credentials by announcing a mobile phone deal with Carphone Warehouse and Orange. It also wants to be big in the world of digital TV, where it sets itself the target to be the dominant player. In a sad reflection of the TV viewer, the first 75,000 or so registrations for digital banking show that most activity takes place at 7.59pm each evening, the gap between Coronation Street and The Bill. As with its closest rival the Halifax, the internet is also the avenue for Abbey to try to break into the business of banking to small businesses, where the dominance of the \"big four\" is already being investigated by the competition commission. But despite all the hype surrounding yesterday's announcements, the City was left cold as Abbey's shares drifted down 5% to 867.5p. One thing that did emerge from yesterday's presentations is the fact that by getting customers to use the net, Abbey can manage accounts at 60% of the cost of traditional equivalents in branches. That kind of statistic is likely to be true for all the banks, and it remains to be seen whether they will pass the lower costs on their customers or please the City by boosting their profits.",

The so-called tie-ins, where insurance and mortgages are linked together, are being targeted by the Department of Trade and Industry, which along with the Treasury is trying to clean up the mortgage industry. The ban will be contained in the consumer protection bill, expected to be included in the next Queen's speech, and should become law by the end of the year. The discovery that building societies - which often claim their mutuality allows them to offer better products than listed banks - are using tie-in insurance deals is expected to embarrass the dwindling mutual sector at the start of the annual Building Societies Association conference this morning in Edinburgh. The major mortgage lenders in the banking sector have already stopped offering such tie-ins and compulsory products and some of the smaller building societies which would have featured on the list as recently as April have with drawn their range of insurance-mortgage deals. Industry sources believe that by continuing to offer tie-ins, some of the building societies may be featuring too prominently in \"best buy\" charts. While many of the building societies contacted by the Guardian insisted they not do make it compulsory for customers to take the insurance, many of them continue to offer a preferential rate of interest to those customers who take the insurance product.

Some of the bigger lenders are still cleaning up their acts in this area: as recently as yesterday Barclays agreed to waive redemption penalties for fixed-rate customers.

      "body": "<p>Sergio Leone might have enjoyed the past few months, for with the King Commission into corruption in cricket about to begin and England's Test series against Zimbabwe finished there would have been no better time to revive The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. </p> <p>The capacity of the England team to teeter between sublime and ridiculous remains unchallenged, even in the new era of Nasser Hussain, Duncan Fletcher and central contracts. </p> <p>At Lord's, albeit against a side whose knees were knocking so noisily they sounded like Andy Flintoff breaking in a new bat, they were brilliantly efficient in conditions that favoured the seam bowlers. </p> <p>Andy Caddick and Darren Gough confirmed that on their day they compare with any opening attack in the game, and Ed Giddins took with aplomb the chance offered him. Centuries from Alec Stewart and Graeme Hick emphasised England's superiority, the former clearly settled into his role down the order now and Hick, in his latest reincarnation, justifying the faith of Fletcher in particular. </p> <p>The innings defeat was one of the heaviest inflicted by England on anyone. Was it complacency that England transported to Nottingham? Were there too many eyes gazing ahead to Edgbaston next week and the first Test against West Indies? </p> <p>The final two days of the Trent Bridge test plumbed the depths once more, the sort of performance which must make coach and captain wonder why they did not take up something less stressful for a living, such as bomb disposal. </p> <p>There was Good, of course, and it came in the form of Mike Atherton. The former captain made scarcely a mistake in scoring 172 runs in the match, and there was a less telling but significant contribution from Mark Ramprakash, who needs a decent run if he is to grow into the role of opener. </p> <p>Graham Gooch, who can tell you more about the techniques and requirements of opening the batting than any man alive, admires Ramprakash's technical ability and believes he can be a class player at the top of the order. The Middlesex man's half-century was well constructed, freer of constraint than for months and ended by a worthy delivery. But centuries are what you are judged by and he knows he has to deliver them. </p> <p>These two apart, Bad and Ugly reared their heads and the batting at Trent Bridge generally was below the standard required in terms of technique and concentration. Twice now, for instance, Hussain has been caught driving in the air, weight on the back foot, and Nick Knight's footwork was way off beam on Monday when promoted to opening. </p> <p>Fletcher seems to think that all Flintoff requires is patience, but the statistics of his innings - 62 balls, 16 runs, one six and one four - point to something more than this. He needs to bone up on simple run accumulation, a necessary adjunct to his massive power, and work is needed on his footwork. </p> <p>\"His form is a concern to us,\" said Fletcher. \"He's an attacking player, but you get to the stage where you are thinking whether you should turn him into a defensive player, and destroy this ability he's got, or let him carry on as he is doing.\" </p> <p>The England bowling was as poor as it had been good at Lord's, offering scoring opportunities galore to Murray Goodwin, a player brought up in Western Australia where back-foot shots are the name of the game. </p> <p>Gough did not look 100% fit and Giddins came back to earth with a bump. Caddick appeared unsure of his length, trying to bowl fuller at times but floating the ball into the drive as a consequence. </p> <p>The leg-spin of Chris Schofield had gone unused at Lord's, and when it was finally unveiled at Trent Bridge it was to reveal a lad full of nerves who received much the same treatment from Goodwin as Hansie Cronje had meted out to Ian Salisbury on the same ground two years ago.

      "bodyText": "Sergio Leone might have enjoyed the past few months, for with the King Commission into corruption in cricket about to begin and England's Test series against Zimbabwe finished there would have been no better time to revive The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. The capacity of the England team to teeter between sublime and ridiculous remains unchallenged, even in the new era of Nasser Hussain, Duncan Fletcher and central contracts. At Lord's, albeit against a side whose knees were knocking so noisily they sounded like Andy Flintoff breaking in a new bat, they were brilliantly efficient in conditions that favoured the seam bowlers. Andy Caddick and Darren Gough confirmed that on their day they compare with any opening attack in the game, and Ed Giddins took with aplomb the chance offered him. Centuries from Alec Stewart and Graeme Hick emphasised England's superiority, the former clearly settled into his role down the order now and Hick, in his latest reincarnation, justifying the faith of Fletcher in particular. The innings defeat was one of the heaviest inflicted by England on anyone. Was it complacency that England transported to Nottingham? Were there too many eyes gazing ahead to Edgbaston next week and the first Test against West Indies? The final two days of the Trent Bridge test plumbed the depths once more, the sort of performance which must make coach and captain wonder why they did not take up something less stressful for a living, such as bomb disposal. There was Good, of course, and it came in the form of Mike Atherton. The former captain made scarcely a mistake in scoring 172 runs in the match, and there was a less telling but significant contribution from Mark Ramprakash, who needs a decent run if he is to grow into the role of opener. Graham Gooch, who can tell you more about the techniques and requirements of opening the batting than any man alive, admires Ramprakash's technical ability and believes he can be a class player at the top of the order. The Middlesex man's half-century was well constructed, freer of constraint than for months and ended by a worthy delivery. But centuries are what you are judged by and he knows he has to deliver them. These two apart, Bad and Ugly reared their heads and the batting at Trent Bridge generally was below the standard required in terms of technique and concentration. Twice now, for instance, Hussain has been caught driving in the air, weight on the back foot, and Nick Knight's footwork was way off beam on Monday when promoted to opening. Fletcher seems to think that all Flintoff requires is patience, but the statistics of his innings - 62 balls, 16 runs, one six and one four - point to something more than this. He needs to bone up on simple run accumulation, a necessary adjunct to his massive power, and work is needed on his footwork. \"His form is a concern to us,\" said Fletcher. \"He's an attacking player, but you get to the stage where you are thinking whether you should turn him into a defensive player, and destroy this ability he's got, or let him carry on as he is doing.\" The England bowling was as poor as it had been good at Lord's, offering scoring opportunities galore to Murray Goodwin, a player brought up in Western Australia where back-foot shots are the name of the game. Gough did not look 100% fit and Giddins came back to earth with a bump. Caddick appeared unsure of his length, trying to bowl fuller at times but floating the ball into the drive as a consequence. The leg-spin of Chris Schofield had gone unused at Lord's, and when it was finally unveiled at Trent Bridge it was to reveal a lad full of nerves who received much the same treatment from Goodwin as Hansie Cronje had meted out to Ian Salisbury on the same ground two years ago. We need to see what he is made of next time he bowls. The performance has provided an interesting test of the merits of central contracts. Between the two Tests, five players - Atherton, Hussain, Stewart, Gough and Caddick - played no cricket. Atherton's response was obvious and Stewart kept wicket immaculately. But the bowlers are more worrying, for it is they who ought to benefit most from the break, the theory being that if they are fit at the end of one match they should be fit for the next, something that all too frequently has not applied to England. It looked at Trent Bridge as if fitness had been traded for efficiency. Neither Gough nor Caddick has bowled sufficient overs this season and their presence for Yorkshire and Somerset respectively in this next round of championship matches ought to serve them well if they stay fit.

Under us it has risen. Who cares more about state education - the people increasing spending, or the person that cut it?\" he asked Hague.</p> <p>\"We are the government investing \u00a36 billion in school buildings,\" he ended.</p> <p>Later in the session, Charles Kennedy brought up the issue of university tuition fees, claiming that their recent abolition in Scotland had led to an increase in the numbers of school leavers going on to higher education.</p> <p>\"If we are going to expand [university numbers] there is going to have to be a balance,\" Blair answered, before raising the political temperature with an attack on the \"piddling little measures\" for reducing crime promoted by the shadow home secretary.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Class war dominated the battle of the soundbites at Prime Minister's Questions this afternoon, as William Hague sought repeatedly to expose differences on the issue between Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. After cursory congratulations on the birth of the Prime Minster's new son, the Tory leader opened his attack early in the session by pointing to the comments on academic elitism made by the Chancellor while the Prime Minister was on paternity leave. \"We all know how difficult it must have been - sleepless nights, a lot of noise, a refusal to settle down, and that was just the Chancellor!\" Hague declared to Tory laughter - and a grin from Gordon Brown. \"Wasn't it a shame that Mr Brown re-ignited class war, plunged the Government into a complete shambles, made statements that he could not back up and exposed a whole catalogue of hypocrisy at the heart of new Labour?\" he continued. He asked the Prime Minister to repeat the Chancellor\"s statement that Oxford University\"s admission process was \"scandalous\". Hague claimed that by speaking out on the issue the Chancellor had exposed a \"catalogue of hypocrisy at the heart of new Labour\". With Brown sitting next to him, the Prime Minister took care not to fall into the trap of seeming to differ from his Chancellor, responding by turning on the record of the Conservatives whilst in office. ``It is only the Tories that could be satisfied with the numbers of children going from state schools to university,\" he said. Blair could not avoid the Tory leader's trump card, however: the fact that whilst the Prime Minster was educated at a fee-paying selective school, Hague had gone to Oxford from his local state comprehensive. \"Hasn't it occurred to you that when the Chancellor whinges about public school boys getting the top jobs, he\"s not just talking about Oxford University,\" the Tory leader demanded, claiming that \"it looks like the Chancellor is being hung out to dry!\" \"However many times you re-launch this Government, isn't it now clear they are happy to use opportunity and privilege for themselves, while trying to deny it to others,\" Hague said. The Prime Minister sustained his attack on the actions of the last Conservative government, reeling off a string of facts which claimed demonstrated Tory failures. \"In the two years you were in the Conservative Cabinet, education spending as a proportion of national income fell. Under us it has risen. Who cares more about state education - the people increasing spending, or the person that cut it?\" he asked Hague. \"We are the government investing \u00a36 billion in school buildings,\" he ended. Later in the session, Charles Kennedy brought up the issue of university tuition fees, claiming that their recent abolition in Scotland had led to an increase in the numbers of school leavers going on to higher education. \"If we are going to expand [university numbers] there is going to have to be a balance,\" Blair answered, before raising the political temperature with an attack on the \"piddling little measures\" for reducing crime promoted by the shadow home secretary.",

      "bodyText": "William Hague's populist attacks on the \"liberal elite\" carry an uncanny echo of criticism of the same group by a maverick rightwinger nicknamed Bonkers. The Conservative leader has read The Abolition of Britain by Peter Hitchens, a very conservative columnist on the very New Labour Daily Express, and has discussed it with the author. Other opposition spokesmen, including David Willetts and Peter Ainsworth, have also read it. Mr Hitchens, like Mr Hague, is for marriage, discipline, private schools, institutions, countryside, patriotism and God. Mr Hague, like Mr Hitchens, is against single parents, welfare, drugs, homosexuality and anybody who can be remotely painted as a liberal do-gooder. When Mr Hitchens published his book last August, he promoted it with the slogan: \"Who stole our country and how can we get it back.\" When Mr Hague addressed the Tory conference last October, he declared: \"If you believe in an independent Britain then come with me and I will give you back your country.\" His aides were anxious to play down the influence of Mr Hitchens on his thinking, but there are clear parallels. When prodded yesterday, Mr Hitchens said: \"It's actually a sign of the dumbing down of the education system that someone like me can even be considered a guru. I got two Bs and a C at A-level.\" Mr Hitchens, 48, started out as a Trotskyist but gradually moved to the right of the Tory party. By his own admission he was a \"crazed Dave Spart\" in the late 1960s and 1970s after joining the International Socialists, occupying the student union at York university and charging a police line protecting Enoch Powell. For years he has been in the shadow of his elder brother, Christopher Hitchens, a flamboyant leftwinger who converted him to Trotskyism before losing influence as sibling rivalry grew. After university Mr Hitchens started work as a journalist in Swindon. He later became a member of Hampstead Labour party, then a disillusioned member and then, in the 1980s, a Thatcherite. During the 1992 election campaign he hounded Neil Kinnock, and before the 1997 contest infuriated the Labour camp by targeting Cherie Blair's leftwing past. When Mr Hitchens considered standing in last year's Kensington and Chelsea byelection, some at Westminster thought it was in part a protest at Michael Portillo's gay past. The Abolition of Britain blamed Thatcher for dismantling much of the beloved past, and its author is now regarded as even to the right of his one time heroine. Mr Hitchens argued that a cultural revolution had robbed Britain of stability and continuity in education, the church, literature and government to the point where they were fast disappearing. Labour was organising a slow coup d'\u00e9tat on the back of a collapse of British self-confidence that started in the 1950s with the adoption of an American way of life. The \"great scaly monster of national abolition\" was close, he wrote.. He said Tony Blair was hell bent on the destruction of Britain by transforming the monarchy, parliament, the union with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland and Britain's relationship with Europe. At the Conservative party conference in Blackpool last autum, Mr Hague said the party believed in the traditions, institutions, values and instincts of the British people. \"That's what the commonsense revolution is all about.\" Mr Hitchens wrote: \"A nation is the sum of its memories, and when those memories are allowed to die, it is less of a nation.\"",

Lady Blackstone An education minister, Lady Blackstone went to Ware grammar school before moving on to the London School of Economics where she completed a doctorate. Her liberal views on issues such as education, race, crime and social disadvantage have made her something of a hate figure for sections of the Tory right.

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair will today assert that New Labour's drive to modernise outdated institutions is rooted in \"the best of old British values\", not promulgated by the liberal elite that William Hague is seeking to blame. As the Conservative party leader refines his main targets in the run-up to the general election, the prime minister will seek to wrest the \"opportunity for all\" agenda back from what he sees as his rival's old-fashioned Tory defence of vested interests. But Mr Hague's team is determined to paint the cabinet into a political corner after the attack by Gordon Brown, the chancellor, on \"old school tie\" elitism - which the Tories say is class warfare, not the classless meritocracy that ministers envisage. In the wake of Mr Hague's broadside yesterday against a liberal elite that is allegedly ruining education, the Tory leader plans a denunciation of a similar group responsible for welfare policy. A senior Hague aide told the Guardian that his sights were also on \"elites\" in charge of health, immigration, social services and adoption. \"The liberal establishment, which lives in a secret garden, is highly resistant to scrutiny and needs to be held to account,\" said the adviser. Mr Hague hopes to make \"culture war\" issues between left and right a crucial election battleground, as Tory campaign strategists at central office accept that fighting the election on the economy will be difficult while incomes rise and unemployment falls. He intends to portray the prime minister and Labour as part of an establishment that is destroying Britain and ignoring the concerns of both working and middle-class citizens - the \"aspirational\" voters who decide the results of most elections. Yesterday he spoke of \"the elitism of a New Labour government increasingly in thrall to the obsessions of the liberal establishment\", and pledged that the next Conservative administration \"will not just turn the tide - we will defeat the liberal elite\". In a counter-blast, Mr Blair will today claim that Mr Hague embodies the \"forces of conservatism\", invoking the keynote phrase in his speech to last year's Labour conference. His speech will be made to a 10,000-strong conference of the Women's Institute at Wembley. The prime minister is not backtracking from attacks on unjustified privilege launched against Oxbridge and other citadels of Old Britain by Mr Brown and other ministers, but his tone will be more inclusive of middle England. And he will emphasise responsibility as well as rights. \"He will be making clear that the programme of modernisation that the government has embarked upon, and is seeing through the building of a New Britain, is rooted in the best of old British values,\" the Down ing Street spokesman, Alastair Campbell, told reporters. \"The central purpose of the government is to deliver opportunity for all, but it can only be possible if we recapture the eroded values of responsibility for all,\" Mr Campbell said, invoking \"the revival of civic society\" as crucial to Mr Blair's ambition. It will be founded in \"rights and responsibilities, rule and order, rather than a society of hierarchy and prejudice\", Mr Blair will tell the WI audience, after first joining them in singing what is both one of theirs and Labour's favourite anthems - Jerusalem. Mr Blair will invoke a series of Labour reforms of public services, designed to root out \"inefficient, old-fashioned systems\" in which staff work flat out but need fundamental change to deliver what voters want, he will say. Health, education, transport and crime will feature in the \"opportunity agenda\", along with Labour's plans for a drugs bill next winter - trailed tomorrow by the home secretary, Jack Straw - to give greater power to the police. \"True equality is not equality of outcomes but equality of worth\", the prime minister will say, a formula that may alarm Labour traditionalists. Mr Hague will have none of it. \"We are speaking up for the silent majority.

This is, after all, a man with a mission to root out wickedness within the Church. </p> <p>But the vicar of Lechlade, Gloucestershire, turns out to be a tall, diffident figure, somewhat overwrought by his research. This has nevertheless resulted in a book likely to re-open issues the Church would prefer not to consider - the abuse of church-goers by priests. </p> <p>The case studies Parsons has detailed in his new book, Ungodly Fear, are hair-raising accounts of vulnerable parishioners manipulated by ministers, accused of demonic possession and homosexuality, sexually abused by priests and made to donate huge sums - in one instance, life savings and the proceeds of a house sale totalling \u00a378,000. </p> <p>The surprise is not that these incidents should occur occasionally but that Parsons, and others working in the field, believe them to be commonplace, much more widespread than the Church of England has ever admitted. In Parsons's view, much abuse is the responsibility of fundamentalist, Bible-bashing sects, many originating their beliefs and techniques in the US. </p> <p>\"I would say that 50 to 75% of middle-of-the-road clergy have at some point in their ministry had to help someone who has come through an experience of abuse,\" says Parsons. \"Abusive episodes are two a penny.\" </p> <p>In his book, Parsons tells the story of Teresa, a parishioner at a large church in the Midlands, who suddenly found herself being progressively shunned by other members of the congregation, including old friends, following the arrival in 1994 of a charismatic but dogmatic new vicar. </p> <p>She discovered that they had been told to avoid her because she was possessed of a devil, apparently because the priest had discovered she had once been raped. Teresa eventually went to see her bishop: \"He said that this vicar had psychological problems. They had been keeping an eye on him since he was ordained, but they weren't sure what was going on. He sort of apologised and said they would keep their eye on him.\" </p> <p>In the case of another woman, Rita, the rapist was her own vicar. He told her it had been prophesied to him that God had made her beautiful so that she could sexually appease Christian men. When she tried to complain, other clergymen accused her of being a liar, or a witch. </p> <p>In the case of Peter, a young and successful minister, church elders at first told him he must be mistaken when he came out as homosexual: \"Don't be silly, you're much too hairy,\" was one comment. They drummed him out of his church flat. They tried to persuade his wife to shun him, wrote to his previous parishes and insisted that all the parishioners he had ever christened should be rebaptised, as if the revelation of his sexuality had rendered the earlier ceremonies invalid. </p> <p>Parsons identifies common features in every case: the exploitation by those in authority of vulnerable people and the use - and sometimes misuse - of biblical references as a means of exercising that authority. </p> <p>He points out that evangelical Christians, especially those on the charismatic and fundamentalist wings of the Anglican and free churches, are used to emphasising the infallibility of the Bible and then to selective referencing to bear out their doctrines. In this way, even child-beating can be justified, as American evangelical writers have happily pointed out - Proverbs 13:24: \"A father who spares the rod hates his son, but one who loves him keeps him in order,\" or the improving tale in Deuteronomy in which parents watch as a disobedient son is stoned to death. </p> <p>This leads some US evangelicals to advise parents to chastise their children from babyhood onwards. Such \"experts\" unaccountably fail to notice the message of a God of love in the New Testament but their own is much more about control. It leads on to other saws such as that \"she [the female child] should never be allowed to argue at all. She should be submissive and obedient. She must obey immediately . . . The parents who require this have done a big favour for their future son-in-law.\" </p> <p>If a congregation can be persuaded to believe such rubbish, the possibilities for misusing power are extensive. As in many of the cases cited by Parsons, anyone choosing such a church at a difficult time - after a divorce or a breakdown, the loss of a job or a bereavement - will be open to being impressed by new friends among the congregation and perhaps less likely to question the code by which they live. </p> <p>As Parsons says: \"Members of the congregation are offered belonging on condition that they conform to the rules offered by the leadership. The rules are not just about behaviour but also about their beliefs and attitudes. </p> <p>\"In return for obedience the individual within the congregation is offered assurance that he or she is saved and also enjoys the promise of eternal life with God. Thus, the individual is allowed to feel safe, a sensation they may only have enjoyed before as a very small child and which has been lost in the harsh realities of adult life. </p> <p>\"But the membership is conditional; at any moment that promise can be withdrawn and the individual left to fend for themselves outside the warmth of the family in a spiritual and social wilderness.\" </p> <p>Reverend John Smith, UK director of the Evangelical Alliance, which has a membership of more than 1m church-goers of various denominations, says: \"We must take our accountability seriously. We try to make sure people are appropriate for their positions of trust but we have an increasing number of independent churches where selection of ministers is decided locally and people may not have sufficient training. </p> <p>\"If we were to suggest a code of good practice, we would be suggesting a Christian leadership model based on the life of Jesus Christ.

      "byline": "Mark Tran",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<b>What's in it for BA and KLM?</b> <br> BA loses money in Europe, partly because its base at Heathrow is too congested. KLM's Schiphol base, on the other hand, has been developed specifically to handle transfer passengers. If they combine, BA would handle the expensive direct flights to and from London, while KLM would handle the cheaper indirect flights. <p><b>Would passengers benefit?</b><br> Passengers after a bargain might come up short. BA and KLM operate discount carriers, Go and Buzz respectively, at Stansted. If the combination knocks out start-ups such as EasyJet, also based at Stansted, then bargain travellers could lose out. EasyJet has already voiced its strong opposition to the planned merger and this is something the competition authorities would have to consider.</p> <p><b>How big would BA/KLM be?</b><br> If this deal goes through, the combined company would create Europe's biggest airline and the world's third-largest career, behind United Airlines and American Airlines in the US, with a value of more than $7.5bn and a fleet of almost 600 aircraft. Strictly speaking it would not be a merger if BA buys the much smaller KLM; more of a friendly take-over.</p> <p><b>Why have there been so many mergers recently?</b><br> It's not just airlines, but across the board and the answer lies in one word: globalisation. As national markets slowly merge with the harmonisation of regulations and globalised communications, including the internet, companies want more resources to compete. In the media world, America Online, the world's biggest online service, is merging with media giant Time Warner. Banking has seen a rash of mergers, including Citicorp in the US, which has acquired a swath of smaller institutions. In the airline industry, United wants to buy US Airways, and BA has been trying for years to form an alliance with American.</p> <p><b>Who has the final say on whether BA can merge with KLM?</b><br> A merger would face scrutiny in the US and Europe as both carriers have significant operations on both sides of the Atlantic. In the US, the planned merger would be investigated by either the US department of justice or the federal trade commission. In Europe, the EU competition commission in Brussels has the final say, with input from the national competition authorities. If BA and KLM decide to merge, Brussels will consult the UK office of fair trading and the department of trade and industry and their Dutch equivalents.</p> <p><b>What powers does the European competition commission have? </b><br> The EU commission can investigate mergers of any companies - not just European ones - that will affect European consumers. It is currently pondering whether to begin a full-scale inquiry into the planned $127bn acquisition of Time Warner by AOL. The commission has forced companies to modify their merger plans in the past, most notably in the Boeing-McDonnell Douglas deal of 1997, which provoked a political row between the US and Europe. The EU agreed to the alliance only after Boeing dropped arrangements that would force airlines to buy exclusively from Boeing.</p> <p><b>Is the BA/KLM deal likely to be approved?</b><br> Yes, Brussels is likely to grant its approval, though the merged group could run into problems over the issue of international route rights, which are governed by official bilateral treaties. This system, dating back to the 1940s, requires a carrier to be majority-owned by nationals where the country is based.

      "bodyText": "What's in it for BA and KLM? BA loses money in Europe, partly because its base at Heathrow is too congested. KLM's Schiphol base, on the other hand, has been developed specifically to handle transfer passengers. If they combine, BA would handle the expensive direct flights to and from London, while KLM would handle the cheaper indirect flights. Would passengers benefit? Passengers after a bargain might come up short. BA and KLM operate discount carriers, Go and Buzz respectively, at Stansted. If the combination knocks out start-ups such as EasyJet, also based at Stansted, then bargain travellers could lose out. EasyJet has already voiced its strong opposition to the planned merger and this is something the competition authorities would have to consider. How big would BA/KLM be? If this deal goes through, the combined company would create Europe's biggest airline and the world's third-largest career, behind United Airlines and American Airlines in the US, with a value of more than $7.5bn and a fleet of almost 600 aircraft. Strictly speaking it would not be a merger if BA buys the much smaller KLM; more of a friendly take-over. Why have there been so many mergers recently? It's not just airlines, but across the board and the answer lies in one word: globalisation. As national markets slowly merge with the harmonisation of regulations and globalised communications, including the internet, companies want more resources to compete. In the media world, America Online, the world's biggest online service, is merging with media giant Time Warner. Banking has seen a rash of mergers, including Citicorp in the US, which has acquired a swath of smaller institutions. In the airline industry, United wants to buy US Airways, and BA has been trying for years to form an alliance with American. Who has the final say on whether BA can merge with KLM? A merger would face scrutiny in the US and Europe as both carriers have significant operations on both sides of the Atlantic. In the US, the planned merger would be investigated by either the US department of justice or the federal trade commission. In Europe, the EU competition commission in Brussels has the final say, with input from the national competition authorities. If BA and KLM decide to merge, Brussels will consult the UK office of fair trading and the department of trade and industry and their Dutch equivalents. What powers does the European competition commission have? The EU commission can investigate mergers of any companies - not just European ones - that will affect European consumers. It is currently pondering whether to begin a full-scale inquiry into the planned $127bn acquisition of Time Warner by AOL. The commission has forced companies to modify their merger plans in the past, most notably in the Boeing-McDonnell Douglas deal of 1997, which provoked a political row between the US and Europe. The EU agreed to the alliance only after Boeing dropped arrangements that would force airlines to buy exclusively from Boeing. Is the BA/KLM deal likely to be approved? Yes, Brussels is likely to grant its approval, though the merged group could run into problems over the issue of international route rights, which are governed by official bilateral treaties. This system, dating back to the 1940s, requires a carrier to be majority-owned by nationals where the country is based. So if BA were to buy KLM, some countries might say that KLM was no longer a national carrier, forcing the Netherlands to renegotiate its air service agreements. That would hugely complicate life for the combined company. Until now, airlines have dodged this problem by buying minority shares in each other and establishing international alliances such as Star Alliance, founded by United and Germany's Lufthansa.

      "body": "<p><strong>West Indies</strong><br></p> <p><strong>Sherwin Campbell</strong><br> Doesn't move his feet very well, but he's added a little more aggression to his batting and took on a quality Pakistan attack very well at times. He may have played here with Durham but I think he'll struggle in these conditions. The vice-captaincy should make him more determined to succeed.</p> <p><strong>Adrian Griffith</strong><br> Has fallen on lean times and could be the one forced out by Lara's return. The progress he made against New Zealand at the beginning of the year was rudely interrupted by Streak and Wasim Akram. One of the genuinely nice guys of the side, and a good team man. Has no qualms about taking on the role of towel-carrier - may be required to. </p> <p><strong>Brian Lara</strong><br> Two runs in three innings is an embarrassing start to the tour. But genius is about really turning it on, and Lara can go from single-figures one innings to a double-century next. It will be tough, and it looks as if he was right when he told one Barbadian radio journalist recently that he hadn't picked up a bat for so long that even he could get him out. Will he be able to fit into the ranks, and which batsman will he (a) replace, or (b) force to open with Campbell?</p> <p><strong>Wavell Hinds</strong><br> Could (harshly, some may think) be forced by Lara's return to drop down or open. But, like Madonna's new movie, he's the Next Big Thing. Scoring runs for fun at the moment, and, in unfamiliar English conditions, is beginning to pick up where he left off against Pakistan. The quality of his debut 165 against Moin's men had to be seen to be believed. Tall, upright, with decisive strokeplay, he is equally at home in Tests or one-dayers. Will be examined by an England attack that knows how to use the conditions, but progressing very quickly.</p> <p><strong>Jimmy Adams</strong><br> Taken to the captaincy very impressively. Excellent handling of his Jamaican teammate Hinds helped him to blossom, and his 48 not out to win the series against Pakistan is probably the most important innings he's played for the side in eight years. His play reminded me of Larry Gomes - an important and underrated player in the successful West Indies team of the '80s. Could be the Gomes to Lara's Viv. </p> <p><strong>Shivnarine Chanderpaul</strong><br> Welcome back. The real determined, adhesive Chandra had gone missing for about two years, but an encouraging end to the Pakistan series and a big hundred at Worcester shows he's rediscovering his good qualities and may be over his chronic fatigue. A crucial member of the side with Lara's form uncertain. </p> <p><strong>Ramnaresh Sarwan</strong><br> A sleepy and jetlagged Ted Dexter was jolted wide awake watching him on TV. Comparisons have been made with the great Rohan Kanhai - a Guyanese East Indian like Sarwan. All this stuff can go to a young man's head. Just ask Lara. At 19, he's been around a long time already - he was being spoken of as a star of the future when I left Guyana five years ago. Could be the one to make way when Lara returns, but as one of only two right-handers in the top eight, it makes sense to play him.</p> <p><strong>Ridley Jacobs</strong><br> His batting's tailed off sharply. Worrying. It's time for him to remind people that he's actually a good batsman. I would move him up to open with Campbell, and keep Hinds in the position in which he's been scoring runs - No.3. </p> <p><strong>Curtly Ambrose</strong><br> There'll be a few tears at The Oval when the great Antiguan takes his cap and sweater from the umpire for the last time. He needs 12 more to make it to 400. Less quick these days, but if the weather stays the way it is, few will be able to exploit it better.</p> <p><strong>Reon King</strong><br> King has forced himself into the position as the third choice behind Ambrose and Walsh. Will interest a few counties by the end of the tour.</p> <p><strong>Franklin Rose</strong><br> Gets movement both ways, has good control, and will get wickets here. Will keep out the quickest bowler in the side Nixon McLean, and the slowest, legspinner Mahendra Nagamootoo.</p> <p><strong>Courtney Walsh</strong><br> 449 and counting. Nursing a slight ankle injury at the moment which could be telling because this remarkable man has stayed relatively free of injury in his 16 years playing Test cricket. His record here speaks for itself, and he'll improve his haul by 12 wickets at least. Then, who knows? Maybe he'll stick around a few more years for a crack at 500.</p> <p>Honourable mentions go to <strong>Chris Gayle</strong> and <strong> Nagamootoo</strong>, both of whom are just on the fringe, and could be involved at some point. Gayle showed promise as yet another left-hander. Lost form and place to Sarwan. Aggressive, can bowl a bit. Nagamootoo on the other hand is kind of passive, but can bat some offspin. Neither of the legspinners - him or Chris Schofield - will have a series to remember. </p> <p><strong>England</strong></p> <p><strong>Mike Atherton</strong><br> Will score runs provided the old back holds up. His mental toughness has served him well against the Windies, and will again this series. He'll be severely tested by Ambrose, who's dismissed him more times (16) than any other bowler. Tends to get squared up by away movement. Ambrose in particular will take note. </p> <p><strong>Mark Ramprakash</strong><br> The Windies bowlers will indicate to us whether he's a Test-class opener. Will be successful if he decides to be attacking. We know he's got the shots, but the only time he made that side of his game sing in harmony with his sound technical ability was the only time he scored a century - 154 at Bridgetown in 1997-98. He'll do well to remember his debut series in 1991, again against West Indies, when he batted well and defended stoutly but only ended up with a string of 20s. Be enterprising. Besides, England don't need two blockers at the top of the order.</p> <p><strong>Nasser Hussain</strong><br> Owes his side some runs, and good enough to get them against this attack. Has improved his strokeplay against quality fast bowling. Who can forget his thunderous hooking against Shaun Pollock? Has tended lately to get himself out to loose shots rather than good balls. Has to be careful that Walsh in particular doesn't have him spooning his slower one to mid-off.</p> <p><strong>Alec Stewart</strong><br> Colin Croft tells me Stewart would never have scored against him, Holding and Co., because he doesn't move his feet. True, the Reeboks often look leaden, but he's always had a teriffic eye to go with his flashing blade, is a very good player of short, fast bowling and his record over the past decade speaks for itself. But he'll struggle once West Indies' bowlers pitch it up and move it around. He's a better player against them in the Caribbean. Won't ignite this series, except perhaps at home at The Oval in the final Test.</p> <p><strong>Graeme Hick</strong><br> Could be the surprise package of the summer. His old aversion to short, fast bowling is well known, and the Windies quartet will be queueing up for a bowl at him. But am I the only journalist in England who wonders why this player has to keep proving himself? His record over the last three years is actually a good one. Could expose the tourists' thin spin options.</p> <p><strong>Nick Knight</strong><br> Would not be in my side. Sorry Nick - you really are just a one-day batsman, but being a specialist is nothing to be ashamed of. One of the greatest Test batsmen, Sunil Gavaskar, just couldn't get his head around the fact that he had a limited number of overs in which to bat. I'd play Graham Thorpe instead, England's best left-hander. </p> <p><strong>Andrew Flintoff</strong><br> Heath Streak took Flintoff to school at Trent Bridge, and showed up embarrassing gaps in his education. He'd better learn very fast, or his could be a short summer. Still, has got awesome potential. Should adopt a policy of attack against Adams's left-arm spin and if he plays, Nagamootoo's legbreaks.</p> <p><strong>Chris Schofield</strong><br> Needs time to prove himself, and if England's much-mentioned new consistency of selection is to mean anything, he should be given that time.</p> <p><strong>Darren Gough</strong><br> The Windies rate him, and if fit he'll get wickets. Has a troubling tendency to disappear from a game for entire sessions, in which time his side could be effectively out of it. I also worry about his batting, which is summed up now by an attempted legs-together heave over extra cover, a shot that gets him out too often. He looks impatient at the crease, as if he's got to catch the 17:15 to Leeds. Once good for at least 20, now a permanent tenant in a longish tail.</p> <p><strong>Andrew Caddick</strong><br> Disappointing at Trent Bridge (who wasn't apart from Atherton and to a lesser extent Ramprakash?), but has been a revelation since his return to the side. Also hangs in there for his 15 or so runs, something that will be valuable in what I think will be low-scoring series.</p> <p><strong>Ed Giddins</strong><br> Calls for his omission after a poor performance in Nottingham were as premature as they were predictable. Come on guys - you've been demanding consistency of selection, and it's only one match since he took seven at Lord's. Having said that though, it looks as if he'll struggle to be menacing on pitches that are not green-tops, but with his ability to move it both ways he'll trouble this long line-up of lefties.</p> <p>Honourable mentions go to two Surrey players, <strong>Graham Thorpe</strong> and <strong> Alex Tudor</strong>, both of whom could be involved before the series is finished. Apart from Stewart, Thorpe cuts and pulls better than any other England player. That's useful against this attack. Proved he's no Lara by being punished for missing a tour. Tudor's batting for Surrey has confirmed that his 99 not out against New Zealand wasn't a fluke. And his bowling's looked penetrative this season too.</p> <p> Overall, the ball will dominate, and unless the weather intervenes, I expect results in four of the matches. Two-two is my call.</p> <p><em>Orin Gordon, born and brought up in Guyana, has lived in London for five years and currently works as a broadcast journalist. <a href=\"http://www.wisden.com/Story_Co_Brand/0,5642,255401,00.html\"> Click here</a>to read his last Anglo-Caribbean View, on Brian Lara: blessing or burden?</em> </p>",

Will interest a few counties by the end of the tour. Franklin Rose Gets movement both ways, has good control, and will get wickets here. Will keep out the quickest bowler in the side Nixon McLean, and the slowest, legspinner Mahendra Nagamootoo. Courtney Walsh 449 and counting. Nursing a slight ankle injury at the moment which could be telling because this remarkable man has stayed relatively free of injury in his 16 years playing Test cricket. His record here speaks for itself, and he'll improve his haul by 12 wickets at least. Then, who knows? Maybe he'll stick around a few more years for a crack at 500. Honourable mentions go to Chris Gayle and Nagamootoo, both of whom are just on the fringe, and could be involved at some point. Gayle showed promise as yet another left-hander. Lost form and place to Sarwan. Aggressive, can bowl a bit. Nagamootoo on the other hand is kind of passive, but can bat some offspin. Neither of the legspinners - him or Chris Schofield - will have a series to remember. England Mike Atherton Will score runs provided the old back holds up. His mental toughness has served him well against the Windies, and will again this series. He'll be severely tested by Ambrose, who's dismissed him more times (16) than any other bowler. Tends to get squared up by away movement. Ambrose in particular will take note. Mark Ramprakash The Windies bowlers will indicate to us whether he's a Test-class opener. Will be successful if he decides to be attacking. We know he's got the shots, but the only time he made that side of his game sing in harmony with his sound technical ability was the only time he scored a century - 154 at Bridgetown in 1997-98. He'll do well to remember his debut series in 1991, again against West Indies, when he batted well and defended stoutly but only ended up with a string of 20s. Be enterprising. Besides, England don't need two blockers at the top of the order. Nasser Hussain Owes his side some runs, and good enough to get them against this attack. Has improved his strokeplay against quality fast bowling. Who can forget his thunderous hooking against Shaun Pollock? Has tended lately to get himself out to loose shots rather than good balls. Has to be careful that Walsh in particular doesn't have him spooning his slower one to mid-off. Alec Stewart Colin Croft tells me Stewart would never have scored against him, Holding and Co., because he doesn't move his feet. True, the Reeboks often look leaden, but he's always had a teriffic eye to go with his flashing blade, is a very good player of short, fast bowling and his record over the past decade speaks for itself. But he'll struggle once West Indies' bowlers pitch it up and move it around. He's a better player against them in the Caribbean. Won't ignite this series, except perhaps at home at The Oval in the final Test. Graeme Hick Could be the surprise package of the summer. His old aversion to short, fast bowling is well known, and the Windies quartet will be queueing up for a bowl at him. But am I the only journalist in England who wonders why this player has to keep proving himself? His record over the last three years is actually a good one. Could expose the tourists' thin spin options. Nick Knight Would not be in my side. Sorry Nick - you really are just a one-day batsman, but being a specialist is nothing to be ashamed of. One of the greatest Test batsmen, Sunil Gavaskar, just couldn't get his head around the fact that he had a limited number of overs in which to bat. I'd play Graham Thorpe instead, England's best left-hander. Andrew Flintoff Heath Streak took Flintoff to school at Trent Bridge, and showed up embarrassing gaps in his education. He'd better learn very fast, or his could be a short summer. Still, has got awesome potential. Should adopt a policy of attack against Adams's left-arm spin and if he plays, Nagamootoo's legbreaks. Chris Schofield Needs time to prove himself, and if England's much-mentioned new consistency of selection is to mean anything, he should be given that time. Darren Gough The Windies rate him, and if fit he'll get wickets. Has a troubling tendency to disappear from a game for entire sessions, in which time his side could be effectively out of it. I also worry about his batting, which is summed up now by an attempted legs-together heave over extra cover, a shot that gets him out too often. He looks impatient at the crease, as if he's got to catch the 17:15 to Leeds. Once good for at least 20, now a permanent tenant in a longish tail. Andrew Caddick Disappointing at Trent Bridge (who wasn't apart from Atherton and to a lesser extent Ramprakash?), but has been a revelation since his return to the side. Also hangs in there for his 15 or so runs, something that will be valuable in what I think will be low-scoring series. Ed Giddins Calls for his omission after a poor performance in Nottingham were as premature as they were predictable. Come on guys - you've been demanding consistency of selection, and it's only one match since he took seven at Lord's. Having said that though, it looks as if he'll struggle to be menacing on pitches that are not green-tops, but with his ability to move it both ways he'll trouble this long line-up of lefties. Honourable mentions go to two Surrey players, Graham Thorpe and Alex Tudor, both of whom could be involved before the series is finished. Apart from Stewart, Thorpe cuts and pulls better than any other England player. That's useful against this attack. Proved he's no Lara by being punished for missing a tour. Tudor's batting for Surrey has confirmed that his 99 not out against New Zealand wasn't a fluke. And his bowling's looked penetrative this season too. Overall, the ball will dominate, and unless the weather intervenes, I expect results in four of the matches. Two-two is my call.

And if that wasn't enough to make him stand out, Koller usually wears white cycling shorts as well.</p> <p><strong>Cycling shorts? That's a bit 1991 isn't it? </strong> Look, he's a Czech. Be thankful he's not got a heavy metal style mullet and a Scorpions T-shirt.</p> <p><strong>I bet his height makes him a bit of a Kevin Francis on the deck</strong> Not according to Paul Doyle of the Irish Times. \"Koller is one of my favourite players,\" he wrote. \"He's more powerful than a well-publicised lie, yet has feet so magical he could perform in a sequel to the Wizard of Oz. I tell you, you should have a butcher's at this boy: when the Czechs drew away to Holland before Christmas, he made spam of Jaap Stam and pounced on chances like a rat in an abattoir.\"</p> <p><strong>Crikey! But can he score? </strong> He certainly can. Last season he scored 27 goals for KSC Lokeren which secured him a move to Anderlecht, and this year he's hit another 20. He also came runner-up in the poll for the Belgian league's player of the year. </p> <p><strong>Wow! I guess it doesn't come much bigger than that. Surely his record at international level can't be as impressive? </strong> How does 14 goals in 14 international matches sound?</p> <p><strong>Isn't that the best performance by a Czech since the legendary Josef Bican in the 1940s? </strong> It certainly is. </p> <p><strong>So who will Koller partner in Euro 2000? </strong> Czech manager Jozef Chovanec will either play with the 6ft 5ins Vratislav Lokvenc (place your bets now on the first commentator to call them the 'Twin Towers') or Vladimir Smicer. </p> <p><strong>Isn't he the slightly built one who doesn't even get into Liverpool's midfield? </strong> Yes - but when he's got a Czech shirt on he's usually pretty good.</p> <p><strong>Really? </strong> Yes, really.</p> <p><strong>So how does Koller think he'll do in Euro 2000? </strong> \"We play teams with some of the best defenders in the world, it'll be difficult to score,\" he admits. \"In Anderlecht, it's different. I have a lot of space and a lot of chances. But at the Euro, we will rely more on team spirit than on the individual performances.\"</p> <p><strong>If he's 27, why haven't I heard of him before? </strong> He was a unknown in the Czech Republic, and it was only after he joined lowly Belgian side Lokeren in 1998 (after being dropped from Sparta Prague's first team for his 'clumsiness' and 'lack of efficiency') that he blossomed.</p> <p><strong>So now he's made it, I bet he gives it large</strong> Very funny. Despite being tipped for a big money move to Lazio this summer, Koller is known for his modesty and congenial personality. \"I know what it's like to be down,\" he says, \"I will never forget the times when I was not even on the bench.\"</p> <p><strong>Not to be confused with: </strong> Jaap Stam, Andre the Giant, Will Self, Dracula, a donkey.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Appearance: Jaap Stam's bigger (and badder) brother. Nickname: 'Dino', as in Dinosaur, for his towering figure. So how tall is he? A gigantic 6ft 8ins Why, he must be the tallest footballer in the world! He's certainly the tallest in Europe. And if that wasn't enough to make him stand out, Koller usually wears white cycling shorts as well. Cycling shorts? That's a bit 1991 isn't it? Look, he's a Czech. Be thankful he's not got a heavy metal style mullet and a Scorpions T-shirt. I bet his height makes him a bit of a Kevin Francis on the deck Not according to Paul Doyle of the Irish Times. \"Koller is one of my favourite players,\" he wrote. \"He's more powerful than a well-publicised lie, yet has feet so magical he could perform in a sequel to the Wizard of Oz. I tell you, you should have a butcher's at this boy: when the Czechs drew away to Holland before Christmas, he made spam of Jaap Stam and pounced on chances like a rat in an abattoir.\" Crikey! But can he score? He certainly can. Last season he scored 27 goals for KSC Lokeren which secured him a move to Anderlecht, and this year he's hit another 20. He also came runner-up in the poll for the Belgian league's player of the year. Wow! I guess it doesn't come much bigger than that. Surely his record at international level can't be as impressive? How does 14 goals in 14 international matches sound? Isn't that the best performance by a Czech since the legendary Josef Bican in the 1940s? It certainly is. So who will Koller partner in Euro 2000? Czech manager Jozef Chovanec will either play with the 6ft 5ins Vratislav Lokvenc (place your bets now on the first commentator to call them the 'Twin Towers') or Vladimir Smicer. Isn't he the slightly built one who doesn't even get into Liverpool's midfield? Yes - but when he's got a Czech shirt on he's usually pretty good. Really? Yes, really. So how does Koller think he'll do in Euro 2000? \"We play teams with some of the best defenders in the world, it'll be difficult to score,\" he admits. \"In Anderlecht, it's different. I have a lot of space and a lot of chances. But at the Euro, we will rely more on team spirit than on the individual performances.\" If he's 27, why haven't I heard of him before? He was a unknown in the Czech Republic, and it was only after he joined lowly Belgian side Lokeren in 1998 (after being dropped from Sparta Prague's first team for his 'clumsiness' and 'lack of efficiency') that he blossomed. So now he's made it, I bet he gives it large Very funny. Despite being tipped for a big money move to Lazio this summer, Koller is known for his modesty and congenial personality. \"I know what it's like to be down,\" he says, \"I will never forget the times when I was not even on the bench.\" Not to be confused with: Jaap Stam, Andre the Giant, Will Self, Dracula, a donkey.",

      "body": "<p> <b>rubenruben: </b> Do you think it smacks somewhat of marginalisation to title two pages of the Guardian 'women'? Doesn't it imply that the rest of the paper is for/by/about men? How about redressing the imbalance with a men's spread too? </p> <p> <b>LBRooks: </b> Obviously, that's an argument that we encounter a lot, and as editor I'm continually reassessing our pages' place in the paper. I don't believe that the women's pages give out the message that women aren't interested in anything else in the paper. I hope that our readers are far more sophisticated than that. Over three decades since their inception, I feel very strongly that the women's pages continue to serve a valuable purpose, providing a forum for the sort of debate that simply doesn't get airplay elsewhere in the paper, or indeed in any other broadsheet. What we're good at is picking out that line in a news story, that detail of a current event, that every woman is talking about in the pub, and that can be unpicked to provide a real insight into women's place in society at the moment. Take the Shipman case for example. Throughout the trial, the one topic that all the women I spoke to were gripped by was the question of why he'd concentrated on killing elderly women. But the women's page was the only broadsheet section to tackle this. That's the sort of analysis we do best. And additionally, you must bear in mind that a large part of my job involves liaising with other parts of the newspaper and suggesting woman-y ideas to them: comment pages, news, and features in particular. We don't work in a vacuum. </p> <p> <b>rubenruben: </b> Libby, sorry, I didn't at all mean to diss the women's page. I think it's a great read. What I meant was that some of the under-reported men's issues would benefit from similar treatment - issues such as men's role as parents, paternity leave, those undiscussed male illnesses, the pressure to be macho etc... </p> <p> <b>john208: </b> While ideally I agree that a women's page shouldn't be necessary, I accept that it probably still is. But I notice a lot more fashion coverage in the news pages these days - or is that just the Guardian's way of having \"Page 3\" type images while pretending to be above body-consciousness?? Do you complain about this to your male editorial colleagues?? Are all the subs male?? </p> <p> <b>LBRooks: </b> john208, well spotted re: fashion coverage. Actually, I think the argument is more 'why do we use Big Wierdy Pix of the latest hip-lacerating McQueen confection rather than presenting innovative but less spooky couture? It's a problem that fashion editors have right across the board I think ,not just at the Guardian. </p> <br> <p> <b>pollster: </b> How about positive discrimination? If a publication wants to cater for all of its readers, surely this would help form a more representative view. </p> <p> And, do you think a man could do your job? </p> <p> <b>LBRooks: </b> pollster. I don't quite understand your point about positive discrimination. As I said before, often it's about sensibility rather than gender and equally about having the space, confidence and respect to articulate oneself in a working environment rather than a mathematical question of numbers. Could a man do my job? Are you offering? I don't doubt that a man can spot the issues of the day that are relevant and/or interesting to women, commission good writers to tackle them, and think up jolly headlines. And often the issues we cover are about women AND men. But that's the mechanics of it. Again, think sensibility. There's a certain sensibility I bring to my work, having been born a woman, an understanding of the female life experience that men - obviously - don't have. So does that mean I think that white journalists can't write about a black issue? Actually, I think that there comes a point, a depth, where they can't, and where having lived the experience becomes essential. So no, lads, you can't do my job. You wouldn't like the hours anyhow. </p> <br> <p> <b>rubenruben: </b> It seems to me that the so-called women's movement is weakened and discredited by huge ideological splits between its various factions. How can it shed itself of the separatist/radical feminist label that means lots of men still laugh at it and lots of ordinary women are put off? </p> <p> <b>DavisJ: </b> A response to rubenruben's comment: Any movement which tries to represent more than 50% of the world's population is necessarily going to be factional. While that makes it difficult to label and box - a good thing, in my opinion - it doesn't discredit it. There is no ONE woman's movement - and that's how it should be. Regarding your comment that it should shed \"itself of its separatist/radical feminist label that means lots of men still laugh at it and lots of ordinary women are put off\", where's the radicalism in Britain? It's all about 'let's all be ladettes' and middle-class angst and little to do with empowering disenfranchised women. As for those men that laugh at the movement - they must prefer to laugh than cry. </p> <p> <b>RPrasad: </b> rubenruben, the word 'feminism' has indeed had many images attached to it. And yes, most labels have been of the 'hairy-legged', 'lesbian' and therefore negative variety. What people laugh at, women as well as men, so often shrouds what the word means. To oversimplify, its about women living fulfilled lives. Who exactly are the 'ordinary' women you say are put off? A survey this week found that women in their 30s and 40s i.e. mothers, working and with partners felt that feminism still had a long way to go. Are they 'ordinary'? The issue of factionalism is often levelled against feminism but this is inevitable when women's lives are richly varied. I see these 'splits' as a strength. Women are still talking, exchanges ideas and yes, disagreeing. </p> <p> <b>LBRooks: </b> DavisJ, I think you're right about there being no single women's movement. Just as women are not homogenous creatures, so feminism for me has always been about celebration of difference as well as of points of contact. The lad culture is a conundrum isn't it? It's always seemed to me all fur coat and no knickers - especially when you see the likes of Zoe Ball posing in yet another lad mag, her tits up round her neck and her arse hanging out, alongside some sexy copy about how dreadfully liberated she's feeling. But I also wonder, as with all these media constructs, exactly how reflective they are of ordinary women's lives. I was analysing the results of a survey of British women's attitudes to relationships a couple of weeks ago and was interested (and relieved) to note that not one respondent referred to or sounded remotely like the ubiquitous Bridget Jones. </p> <br> <p> <b>DSmith39: </b> According to research conducted by the LSE a woman who chooses not to have children and to compete \"equally\" with men will still earn \u00a3100,000 less over a lifetime than a similarly qualified man. If the woman is a mother the figure rises to \u00a3250,000. A woman with GCSEs \"loses\" \u00a350,000 more than a woman with no qualifications. </p> <p> <b>LBRooks: </b> I thought that the LSE research was really interesting too, in that it completely exploded the myth that women suffer pay inequality because they choose to have children. The results showed that even women who remain childfree, and compete on an entirely level playing field with men, are still losing out. The bottom line is that this happens because they're women, pure and simple. Did you see that the French parliament is currently considering a bill to enforce equal pay? I wonder if the provisions will be any stronger than our own Equal Pay Act, and whether one of the reasons that that piece of legislation is failing so many women is that we're fairly shy about talking about pay issues over here. The Equal Opportunities Commission is currently encouraging employers to undertake pay audits, but how often do employees themselves get together and discuss pay disparities? </p> <br> <p> <b>Careena: </b> Libby and Raekha - what are your thoughts on the situation in Afghanistan, and what if anything can be done for women in that country? It seems to me that in this instance, the West is quite happy to sit back and watch, because the potential laying of a pipeline is more important than any human rights issue, let alone women's rights... </p> <p><b>RPrasad: </b></p> <p> I think the way women's rights have become so central to the politics of the Taliban is incredibly complicated. While not denying that women's rights are not upheld in Afghanistan, I can't help but notice how news reports from the country consistently show pictures of women in purdah while the words concentrate on the regime. These images are often used as a shorthand to 'prove' how different the Taliban are from western, liberal democracies. </p> <p> As you say, there is currently a divide between women's rights and human rights, with the latter currently having more legitimacy in international law. I feel women's rights should always be viewed as part of human rights. </p> <p> <b>Careena: </b> I'd certainly agree with you Raeka on the issue of women's rights being viewed as a part of human rights, and also to an extent on the way in which the images of women in purdah are used to prove something in the western media. It's just that there is very little coverage of how much has been taken away from the people of Afghanistan... I have met people who have managed to get away, and the picture they paint of what has happened is appalling - for men as well, but particularly for women. I suppose what makes it seem so bad to me is that these were people who were making progress in terms of education, and equal rights for all, and now they have been sent back into the dark ages - with women unable to work, and in many instances, unable to gain access to basic medical treatment. I understand that it is a difficult and complex issue to answer in this sort of forum, but wanted to bring it up - this being international women's day... There is a tendency to concentrate on the changes or lack of them in the west, and very little concentration on the erosion of women's rights (as a part of human rights) in other parts of the world. </p> <br> <p> <b>ELLENDERD: </b> Referring to arecent Guardian article on \"sorted\" categorisation of people (single people with loads of money to spend) the emphasis was that \"one day\" all single people want to be \"married with children\". In this day and age (and given today being women's day), I challenge the assumption that one has to have any sort of partner (male or female) and a family in order to be a \"proper adult woman\". </p> <p> <b>LBRooks: </b> I think that society is generally becoming more and more tolerant towards single people. We retain an awkward attitude to single women though: at one extreme we fetishise the notion of the single, successful, autonomous female; at the other we hark back to the traditional assumption that no woman is complete without a man. There's also an assumption that the biological clock impulse is only ever experienced by women. On a personal level - and don't jump on me for the generalisation - I believe that we're all social animals, desiring and functioning best as a partnership. That said, of course there's no reason why individuals - male or female - shouldn't be perfectly happy on their own. It's interesting to bring in the Bishop of Rochester's comments here: why should it be beholden on married couples to procreate? It's a totally ridiculous notion. I long for the day when we can dispose of these essentialist concepts of what a Proper Family ought to be. It's nothing to do with community, and everything to do with a really dangerous, reductive strain of morality. </p> <br> <p> <b>pollster: </b> Have you encountered sexism while working in the media? </p> <p> <b>LBRooks: </b> Before coming to the Guardian, I worked in a couple of offices where the atmosphere was a whole lot less female-friendly. But to be honest, I think that's more about badly managed departments, where there's no top-down imperative to treat women equally, rather than endemic sexism. I do think that the media faces some very specific issues when it comes to gender: the representation question, for example, is in your face 24 hours a day - which pictures do you choose, how do you ensure that there are as many female as male voices represented in your reports? And as often as not, you're doubly bound because the issues you're covering don't have that female content to begin with. Crude example: how can you get female voices into a report on the senior judiciary when there are so few women judges? So we learn to be imaginative, and much of the time it's about sensibility as much as gender. </p> <br> <p> <b>sianie00: </b> What do you think of the TV show Ally McBeal? Do you think it presents positive role models for young women? </p> <p> <b>LBRooks: </b> Don't get me started on Ally McBeal. It's foul and totally counterintuitive and yet... and yet... I find it strangely seductive. And also increasingly painful to watch as you look at poor wee Calista's collar bones protrude further and further through the clothes they keep layering on her to hide her skinniness. I think it's totally irresponsible of the producers to let that show continue when the star is so obviously sick. I mean, she's got that terrible, gaunt, hunted look that anorexics get. Gah! As for the content itself - I find it really annoying because the message is basically this: here you are girls, you're young, successful, intelligent, you've reaped all the benefits of the 70s feminist generation but, surprise, all you ever really wanted was a man and a home and to be up to your armpits in nappies... It's a really insidious message I think. But it's still infuriatingly compulsive. Does that make me inconsistent? Sod it. </p> <p> <b>sianie00: </b> I completely agree about Ally McBeal...that she has everything that women have fought for but it doesn't give her any confidence or sense of empowerment and is looking to a man to make her feel secure. Sickening! And as for the skinniness thing - it's the same thing with Posh Spice. </p> <p> <b>RPrasad: </b> Don't get me started on Posh Spice. Let's just say goodbye. There's women's page work to be done. Keep talking. </p> <br> <p> <b>LBRooks: </b> I'm afraid we've got to go now otherwise there won't be a women's page in the paper tomorrow. Thanks for your thoughts, and we'll keep checking this later on. Best libby </p>",

So we learn to be imaginative, and much of the time it's about sensibility as much as gender. sianie00: What do you think of the TV show Ally McBeal? Do you think it presents positive role models for young women? LBRooks: Don't get me started on Ally McBeal. It's foul and totally counterintuitive and yet... and yet... I find it strangely seductive. And also increasingly painful to watch as you look at poor wee Calista's collar bones protrude further and further through the clothes they keep layering on her to hide her skinniness. I think it's totally irresponsible of the producers to let that show continue when the star is so obviously sick. I mean, she's got that terrible, gaunt, hunted look that anorexics get. Gah! As for the content itself - I find it really annoying because the message is basically this: here you are girls, you're young, successful, intelligent, you've reaped all the benefits of the 70s feminist generation but, surprise, all you ever really wanted was a man and a home and to be up to your armpits in nappies... It's a really insidious message I think. But it's still infuriatingly compulsive. Does that make me inconsistent? Sod it. sianie00: I completely agree about Ally McBeal...that she has everything that women have fought for but it doesn't give her any confidence or sense of empowerment and is looking to a man to make her feel secure. Sickening! And as for the skinniness thing - it's the same thing with Posh Spice. RPrasad: Don't get me started on Posh Spice. Let's just say goodbye. There's women's page work to be done. Keep talking. LBRooks: I'm afraid we've got to go now otherwise there won't be a women's page in the paper tomorrow. Thanks for your thoughts, and we'll keep checking this later on. Best libby",

But when I went to my local chemist, the pharmacist's assistant couldn't find them. </p> <p>She knew they were somewhere, she was sure she'd seen my name on something. \"What are they for?\" she said, scrambling amongst the little white boxes. I told her there was a lot of them: Buserelin, Urofollitrophin, Chorionic Gonadotrophin, Progesterone. I felt safe saying them out loud. These were mere technical terms, sounding as if they could be a cure for almost anything, not at all incriminating. And, of course, I knew them by heart as everyone - everyone who's infertile like me, that is - does. </p> <p>We tend to be hugely researched into our condition. It usually takes a couple of years at least from diagnosis to treatment, so we amuse ourselves, thinking that we're Doing Something, by sending off for vast amounts of literature on infertility drugs and entering their names into our internet search engines. It's not a comforting exercise. Although there is no evidence, there are continual chat room discussions about the high doses of hormones causing cancer. </p> <p>The names didn't seem to help the assistant. \"What're they <strong>for</strong>?\" she insisted. I repeated their names. She repeated the question. Our eyes locked over the throat lozenges, athlete foot ointments, and hayfever remedies. There was already a short queue flapping prescriptions behind me. I leant over the counter. \"IVF treatment,\" I said, as quietly and nonchalantly as possible. Then, emboldened not by bravery but anger, stood up straight and shouted: \"THEY'RE FOR IVF.\" </p> <p>The young man behind me in the Nike Air baseball cap, all of 18, sniffed. I guessed he'd come in for an extra packet of Durex Gold. He'd never be standing in a queue blurting out anything like <strong> that</strong>. </p> <p>He's probably right. Infertility is not as common as you might think: 95% of couples conceive within two years of trying. But if infertility only directly affects a few, fear of infertility is rife; one in seven seek medical advice to help become pregnant. It's as if now infertility has been publicly acknowledged and named, it is a spectre that could fall on any of us. I have a 40-year-old friend who, after a couple of months of a most vigorous sex life, was so distraught that she hadn't \"fallen\" that she attempted to make an appointment with infertility superstar Professor Sir Winston himself. </p> <p>When my drugs were eventually placed on the counter, it wasn't a carrier bag full after all. It was two. The assistant now became over-solicitous. \"Let us know if there's any news,\" she cooed. \"We had someone in here once, and now she's out here.\" She stretched her arms to embrace a phantom pregnancy. \"You read a lot about how successful it is in the papers.\" </p> <p>Indeed you do. The assistant's assumption of intimacy would have been shocking if it hadn't happened before. I'm asked all the time why I haven't had another child, by people I've barely met, who demand an explanation. Although it's at the cutting edge of medical procedures, curiously IVF is not generally regarded as a straightforward medical matter, so us patients aren't afforded the usual discretion and privacy that automatically accompanies any other condition. Can you imagine the woman in your local chemist leaning over the counter as she hands you your haemorrhoid cream and whispering: \"Do let me know if that works. Keep me informed how your piles get on.\" </p> <p>As I marched out past the queue, an assortment of strangers offered a sympathetic, shallow smile. It was as if I were a woman being sent to her execution for a crime we all knew I did not commit. </p> <p>But the long walk home hadn't ended. Coming out of the chemist, I spotted a colleague striding up the street in my direction. What the hell was he doing here? I was close to home, far from my office. Did he live hereabouts? How was I going to explain my emerging from the chemist with two full carrier bags? I dipped my head down, pretending not to see him, and wandered off up a side street. By the time I dared raise my head, I was lost in a street I'd never walked along before. </p> <p>When I reached home, almost 20 minutes later, a builder was putting up a ladder in my next door neighbour's front garden, preparing to paint her window frames. \"Been shopping, then?\" he said, searching for smalltalk and nodding at the carrier bags. \"Yep,\" I said, nodding back, before entering the safety of my own front door, shutting it firmly behind me.</p>",

But when - if at all - does \"girlish\" behaviour in a boy or \"boyishness\" in a girl become a problem? And whose problem is it anyway? </p> <p>Tom is eight, and has been playing with dolls since he was old enough to hold one. A quiet child, he shuns the football brigade at playtime in favour of playing and talking to girls, and the one or two other boys who don't like rough and tumble. At home, he still loves playing imaginative games with dolls and animal toys. Sometimes he and his younger sister dress up in sparkly swirly costumes, festoon themselves with their mother's necklaces and paint their faces with make-up. </p> <p>Tom will never win a popularity contest among his peers. Because he's friends with all the girls, the boys will have nothing to do with him. At home, his parents love and accept him for the rather eccentric child he is, providing him with a range of experiences, like camping, swimming and music lessons, like all good parents do. </p> <p>Do they worry about his gender identity? \"Not at all,\" says his father Philip. \"Tom knows he's a boy and that he's a bit different from other boys, but he's secure and happy being who he is.\" </p> <p>Tom is a very lucky child. Many parents would find his behaviour difficult to deal with, says Dr Domenico Di Ceglie, consultant child psychiatrist and director of the Gender Identity Development Clinic at the Portman Clinic in London. Gender is, he says, a psycho-social construct. \"You can't dissociate what the child is feeling from what parents feel and from what society's views of conventional behaviour are.\" </p> <p>While Tom's behaviour is different to that of most boys of his age, it would only become a problem if it were part of a larger picture. \"When a child's behaviour occurs purely in the context of role play and the child retains its identity in the role, it's perfectly normal. It's when children say they want to be the other sex and cross-dress and avoid play stereotypically associated with their own sex, prefer friends of the opposite sex and dislike their bodies that they and their families need to be listened to professionally.\" </p> <p>When Jacky Miller heard what her daughter was feeling, she knew she had to take action. Almost from birth, her daughter Katie preferred a \"boyish\" lifestyle. Jacky has a photograph of her Katie, now nine, taken just before her second birthday. In it, she's sitting in the middle of her smiling family, scowling. Why? Because of the dress she's wearing. She hated wearing dresses. </p> <p>Shortly after the photo was taken, Katie insisted on having all her curls cut into a short crop. She only played with boys and when they'd come over, she'd always manage to get them to part with their Y-fronts. She even wrote to Father Christmas begging for some. </p> <p>By the time she started school at four, Katie was wearing boys' school trousers, had adopted a streetwise strut and would only play Barbies with her older sisters if she could be Ken. But she far preferred guns, trains and cars. </p> <p>Looking back, Jacky says that she didn't yet think that Katie's behaviour was anything to worry about because she was such a popular, happy child. \"Even when her friends would sometimes call her 'him', it didn't really worry me.\" </p> <p>The crunch only came when, aged seven, Katie told her mum that she wanted to change her name to Dennis, that she felt like a boy inside and that if she ever grew breasts she'd cut them off with a knife or \"pop them with pins\". It was then that Jacky knew they needed help. \"I realised this was more than just being a tomboy,\" she says. \"I felt I couldn't risk not intervening.\" </p> <p>A child psychiatrist confirmed that Katie needed specialist help and referred her to the Gender Identity Development Unit. There, Katie and family saw a clinical social worker, a member of the multi-disciplinary team who agreed that she appeared to have a gender identity problem. During five visits, Katie, her sisters and parents talked about how they felt. </p> <p>Often Katie would sit on the floor playing with blocks or drawing as the rest of the family vented their views. \"My oldest daughter would say, 'Oh mum, you're making a big deal out of it. She's quirky and odd but she's fine.' And my middle daughter said things like, 'She'll be whatever she'll be. All you need is love.' After a couple of times, they didn't come any more.\" </p> <p>Katie herself was open about how she felt and said that she didn't think she had a problem. </p> <p>During that time, the Portman Clinic suggested that Jacky contact Mermaids, a family support group for children and adolescents with gender identity problems. She and Katie went a few times but Jacky found that her daughter's boyish behaviour became exaggerated during and after the visits. \"I didn't think that was what Katie needed. It clarified to me that she wasn't like the other children there who had genuine gender identity problems. For her, it wasn't all-consuming.\" </p> <p>That was a year ago. Today, Katie appears to have forgotten all about Dennis, has let her hair grow out and has a new friend who happens to be a girly sort of girl. She has even worn dresses. </p> <p>So what was it all about? Jacky doesn't know and neither does she understand why Katie was the way she was. \"I've often asked myself if I encouraged this on some level. I don't think so. At first I was delighted to have a girl who wanted to play with cars instead of dolls. I was a feminist mum. But it clearly was something else and when people would say to me, 'Oh yeah, I was a tomboy when I was young', I'd think, 'This is different.'

      "body": "<p><strong> Michael Forte: Children and Young People's Programmes, Carlton, father of five </strong> </p> <p>The idea of stopping children from watching TV, with ever more channels appearing, is impractical. The best we can do is monitor what they watch. Too many kids experience TV purely passively; many satellite channels provide \"moving wallpaper\". This is a shame, as dedicated children's services, especially on the two main terrestrial channels, offer quite proactive TV. The best of ITV and BBC encourage other activities. We undervalue the quality of bespoke TV for kids. Parents don't play an active enough role in their children's viewing. If they took the time to watch children's TV, they'd find a rich and varied diet. Don't watch less, just watch more quality.<br>Verdict: No</p> <p><strong>Iona Kenrick: Mother of John, four, and Guy, two; TV-less since Easter </strong> </p> <p>We hid the TV after a blissful week's holiday without one. John hadn't watched loads; but once you turned it on, that was it for at least half an hour. Now he looks at books and he plays, and seems happier. There's been no whingeing. They're more mentally active, interacting with their own imaginations and playing games. Also, if they're at home with someone else while I'm at work, I know they're not just sitting in front of the TV. Keeping them occupied when I get home isn't a problem; after a day's work I want to be with them. John sees TV at friends' houses and knows all about Pok\u00e9mon and things like that. The pay-off is that we're going to buy a computer.<br>Verdict: Yes</p> <p><strong> Dr David Lewis: Child psychologist, did TV survey for <a href=\"http://www.planet4kids.com\">www.planet4kids.com</a> </strong><br> </p> <p>Our research found that the longer kids spend staring at TV or computer screens, the less physically and mentally active they are, and the less well they do at school. When kids watch TV, they sit down and switch off. There are three risks. First, kids are not physically active enough and generally don't play outside.

      "bodyText": "Michael Forte: Children and Young People's Programmes, Carlton, father of five The idea of stopping children from watching TV, with ever more channels appearing, is impractical. The best we can do is monitor what they watch. Too many kids experience TV purely passively; many satellite channels provide \"moving wallpaper\". This is a shame, as dedicated children's services, especially on the two main terrestrial channels, offer quite proactive TV. The best of ITV and BBC encourage other activities. We undervalue the quality of bespoke TV for kids. Parents don't play an active enough role in their children's viewing. If they took the time to watch children's TV, they'd find a rich and varied diet. Don't watch less, just watch more quality. Verdict: No Iona Kenrick: Mother of John, four, and Guy, two; TV-less since Easter We hid the TV after a blissful week's holiday without one. John hadn't watched loads; but once you turned it on, that was it for at least half an hour. Now he looks at books and he plays, and seems happier. There's been no whingeing. They're more mentally active, interacting with their own imaginations and playing games. Also, if they're at home with someone else while I'm at work, I know they're not just sitting in front of the TV. Keeping them occupied when I get home isn't a problem; after a day's work I want to be with them. John sees TV at friends' houses and knows all about Pok\u00e9mon and things like that. The pay-off is that we're going to buy a computer. Verdict: Yes Dr David Lewis: Child psychologist, did TV survey for www.planet4kids.com Our research found that the longer kids spend staring at TV or computer screens, the less physically and mentally active they are, and the less well they do at school. When kids watch TV, they sit down and switch off. There are three risks. First, kids are not physically active enough and generally don't play outside. Second, they're not interacting with each other and developing social skills. Third, they become inattentive due to TV used as \"visual valium\". In terms of actually banning it, you can't cold turkey it. Children are most vulnerable during their first five years so, depending on their age, no more than an hour a day is acceptable on average.

It was when I realised that perhaps she wasn't going to have a Caesarian, as I had blithely assumed. Well you would at 45, wouldn't you? But Caesarian babies are often delivered early, and there was no sign of Cherie arriving at hospital at an appointed hour: the opposite - there was the false alarm a couple of days before the birth. The QC, PM's wife, mother of three teenagers was planning to do it all by herself. </p> <p>Oh yes, I've been keeping a close eye on Cherie, because I'm having a baby too, and I'm even older than she is. Cherie is four months younger than I am (I said I was obsessed). By the time my baby is due, in October, I will be 46. So as my already swollen bosom swells a little more with pride in the geriatric motherhood stakes, I confess that Cherie Booth has been something of a role model. I'm afraid all that's beginning to change. </p> <p>When I first heard the news (hers not mine) I felt apprehensive. I had three miscarriages in between having my first child, now five, when I was 40, and this trouble-free pregnancy. Would the same happen, inevitably all too publicly, to Cherie? And what about tests? The choices and their implications are bewildering but none, apart from amniocentesis for Down's syndrome, which carries its own slight risk of miscarriage, is conclusive. As a devout catholic, for Cherie these choices and their outcome if, for example, she was carrying a Down's baby, would be made even more fraught by the moral debate her reaction would inevitably create. Worried? I was frantic. </p> <p>But by early February, when I knew I was pregnant again and Cherie blossomed, she became a great comfort to me. Only a few people have the nerve to reassure you that you'll be able to have another baby in your mid-40s. Doctors, having done their best to establish there is nothing clinically wrong, sit on the fence, wanting neither to raise nor dampen your hopes. My mother, who had me at 40 (we're late developers in our family), was the most cheering. \"I don't know what all the fuss is about,\" she said one day as we were talking about Cherie's pregnancy. \"What do you think used to happen before? Nobody would have batted an eyelid.\" </p> <p>Statistics prove her point. US research shows that in the 1920s, the average age at which women had their last child was 42. I'm old enough to remember what changed all that: the hard-won right to control your own fertility and combine a job with motherhood. Now I can tell by the look on some people's faces - especially the clever ones who neatly dropped a couple in their early 30s while continuing to climb up the career ladder - that they find the idea of having a baby in middle age positively yucky. Yet things could be turning full circle. About 11,000 babies a year are born to women over 40, double the number 10 years ago. Statistics are all very well, but there is nothing as reassuring as knowing somebody your age really is having a baby, and that everything seems to be going fine. Three cheers for Cherie! </p> <p>But then I began to find my role model a little daunting. She worked up to the last minute and gave birth naturally, even though her previous deliveries hadn't all been plain sailing. After only one disastrous attempt at doing it naturally, I'm certainly not about to have another go, thank you. Pass the epidural. </p> <p>I read that in September she'll go back to her cool old job at her hot new chambers, albeit part-time. I gave my proper job up to a) spend more time with my family; and b) try to make said family bigger. </p> <p>Well, it looks as if I've managed that, so far at least, and nothing is more important or joyous for all of us, but I have to admit I do envy her in that respect. And I know she couldn't be seen to be clogging up the dreaded waiting lists, but even so, only four hours in hospital? And all that lip gloss in the photo with Tony - although when I saw the picture of him carrying little Leo a week later and looking rather pale, I confess to punching the air and hissing: \"Yessssss! He's knackered!\" </p> <p>Go on Cherie, have the double extra nanny portions you deserve, instead of asking your Mum to help look after the baby.

The rest of it, to be perfectly honest, is a bit of an alcoholic haze, punctuated with wild all-night parties and occasional trips up to London for a spot of shopping. </p> <p>Fear not: I wasn't a camper. On the other hand, fear more: I was a camp counsellor, one of the supposedly responsible grown-ups charged with the care of children like yours and mine. I was 18, straight out of my fresher year at university. I'd rarely looked after kids, I wasn't interested in a child-related career, and what was in it for me was a good time. Thankfully, the youngsters survived - though the company that employed me seems to be no more - but the memory of what a hopeless counsellor I was does make my hair stand on end. Put it this way: you won't catch me sending my daughter to summer camp. </p> <p>Or you wouldn't have done. Alas for me, Rosie, aged eight, has been mesmerised by the pile of summer camp brochures I've requested as research for this article, and she's rather got the wrong end of the stick. It's not so much, \"Would you send me there, mummy?\" as \"When will I be going?\" And she's only asked about 100 times in the past 24 hours. She keeps pleading to watch one company's promo video, but I know if she does there will be no turning back. Rosie will be off to summer camp for a week (\"Just a week? I wanted to stay for the whole of my holidays!\" scream the quotes in the brochures), and I'll have stumped up \u00a3300-odd for a nail-biting seven days wondering if she's paralysed with homesickness or risking life and limb learning to abseil with some hungover undergraduate holding the safety rope. </p> <p>On the other hand, I too have waded through the brochures - and secretly watched the video - and I can see that summer camps in Britain have come a long way in 19 years. \"Facilities\" at the place I worked meant an unheated outdoor swimming pool and a playing field; the setting was a minor public school, and the children slept in huge, smelly dormitories with bizarre names like \"Wildebeest\" inspired by the hunted animals whose skeletal heads grinned down from above the bunkbeds. In many ways, the whole experience - for the children - differed little from that of the youngsters who occupied the same space in term time, minus any formal teaching. In reality, it was boarding school by another name: from our camp leader, who spent the rest of his working life as a headmaster, to the matron, who worked at a nearby prep, most of the senior staff were drawn from the school environment, and the emphasis was on containment and discipline, with fun a poor second. </p> <p>Fast forward a couple of decades, and Fun, with a capital F, has become the name of the game. I can't imagine many of the inmates from our dreary little camp went home pleading to go back, but these days parents are allowed no rest from their returning offspring until the deposit has been mailed for next year. And not just any time next year: it seems the little darlings spend their last night plotting to meet up again - same time, same place, a year from now - so God help you if you fail to secure that booking for 2001. \"Meeting your friends again is definitely the best bit,\" says Ellis Knight, 13, due to return for the fourth year in succession to the 3D adventure camp on the Isle of Wight this summer. \"That and the quad biking, the go-karting, the swimming, the climbing, the football, the computers, the watersports, the orienteering and the canoeing. Oh yes, and the disco.\" </p> <p>Strewth, Ellis, isn't it all a bit, well, overwhelming? \"Well, you can have a quiet sit-down if you want,\" he says politely. \"But the point is, most of us don't want to. We like all the action. If you want to know, it's fantastic. I can't wait to go back.\" </p> <p>In the US, summer camps are big business. School holidays are longer there - two and a half or even three months - and some youngsters go away for as long as seven or eight weeks. For professional, medium-to-high income families (especially city dwellers with two working parents) a few weeks at a rural camp for the kids is as much a seasonal norm as a fortnight at the beach for the whole clan. </p> <p>Many camps are infused with a sense of mission, with the character-building, back-to-nature, adventure-in-the-forest experience one of the hot favourites. Laura Foote, who lives near Boston, thinks her children have benefited hugely from their weeks away: \"My daughter Eleanor has been going to the Aloha camp in Vermont since she was nine, and she's eager to return for her fourth summer. It's not a place for complainers - the accommodation is very basic, with three girls and one counsellor in a tent raised above the ground on a wooden platform. </p> <p>\"The tents have no electricity, though there is a lightbulb in the wash-house down the path. Some would want more comforts, but my daughter views it as a fun adventure. For her it has been a wonderful experience - going swimming, sailing and canoeing in a beautiful lake every day.\" </p> <p>Both Eleanor and her brother Henry have learnt, says Laura, self-reliance and outdoor skills. She sees it as \"a healthy antidote to the typical lifestyle of preteens where there is a tendency to seek instant entertainment, and the competitive atmosphere many children are in now.\" </p> <p>This \"ideal childhood\" aspiration isn't yet as much a part of the summer camp scene in Britain, but it can't be far away. \"Fat camps\", which promise to slim down those overweight couch potato teenagers we've been warned about yet again this week, are already blossoming here after taking off Stateside, and it can only be a question of time before we see whole five-a-side teams and rounders squads booking en masse into team improvement camps as they already do in the US. British summer camps may still be in their childhood, but they have the potential to grow up fast. </p> <p>The only downside to the whole thing I can eke out of the children who've been to camp is the risk of bad weather. \"If it rains, the whole thing can be a bit boring,\" says Camp Beaumont veteran Antony Onipko, 15. And the naughtiest thing any of them will admit to having got up to is an occasional illegal cigarette - though they're hardly going to spill the beans, are they, given that they're all so desperate to go back? </p> <p>I confess to being reassured by a phonecall to the market leader PGL (named after the initials of its founder Peter Gordon Lawrence, incidentally, though most of the kids who've been there will tell you it stands for Parents Get Lost). They are adamant there's no way they'd employ anyone like me at any of their camps in the year 2000: applicants for jobs as counsellors (\"group leaders\" in PGL parlance) must demonstrate real commitment to working with kids, and definitely shouldn't just think of it as a holiday for themselves. </p> <p>I'm inspired, too, by Madeleine Knight, Ellis's mum, who regales me with stories of how some parents drop their offspring off at camp en route to the airport, where they jet off for a week \u00e0 deux in the Caribbean. Now there's an idea. OK, Rosie, you win: here's that video . . .</p>",

Many camps are infused with a sense of mission, with the character-building, back-to-nature, adventure-in-the-forest experience one of the hot favourites. Laura Foote, who lives near Boston, thinks her children have benefited hugely from their weeks away: \"My daughter Eleanor has been going to the Aloha camp in Vermont since she was nine, and she's eager to return for her fourth summer. It's not a place for complainers - the accommodation is very basic, with three girls and one counsellor in a tent raised above the ground on a wooden platform. \"The tents have no electricity, though there is a lightbulb in the wash-house down the path. Some would want more comforts, but my daughter views it as a fun adventure. For her it has been a wonderful experience - going swimming, sailing and canoeing in a beautiful lake every day.\" Both Eleanor and her brother Henry have learnt, says Laura, self-reliance and outdoor skills. She sees it as \"a healthy antidote to the typical lifestyle of preteens where there is a tendency to seek instant entertainment, and the competitive atmosphere many children are in now.\" This \"ideal childhood\" aspiration isn't yet as much a part of the summer camp scene in Britain, but it can't be far away. \"Fat camps\", which promise to slim down those overweight couch potato teenagers we've been warned about yet again this week, are already blossoming here after taking off Stateside, and it can only be a question of time before we see whole five-a-side teams and rounders squads booking en masse into team improvement camps as they already do in the US. British summer camps may still be in their childhood, but they have the potential to grow up fast. The only downside to the whole thing I can eke out of the children who've been to camp is the risk of bad weather. \"If it rains, the whole thing can be a bit boring,\" says Camp Beaumont veteran Antony Onipko, 15. And the naughtiest thing any of them will admit to having got up to is an occasional illegal cigarette - though they're hardly going to spill the beans, are they, given that they're all so desperate to go back? I confess to being reassured by a phonecall to the market leader PGL (named after the initials of its founder Peter Gordon Lawrence, incidentally, though most of the kids who've been there will tell you it stands for Parents Get Lost). They are adamant there's no way they'd employ anyone like me at any of their camps in the year 2000: applicants for jobs as counsellors (\"group leaders\" in PGL parlance) must demonstrate real commitment to working with kids, and definitely shouldn't just think of it as a holiday for themselves. I'm inspired, too, by Madeleine Knight, Ellis's mum, who regales me with stories of how some parents drop their offspring off at camp en route to the airport, where they jet off for a week \u00e0 deux in the Caribbean. Now there's an idea. OK, Rosie, you win: here's that video . . .",

There were photographs of volunteers involved in domestic care, which isn't normally an area which is featured in high-profile photographs - it can be a monotonous task. Photographs showed a very strong and happy relationship between the volunteers and the person being looked after, and a great feeling of enjoyment in the volunteering that was going on. Also, the photographs showed inter-generational volunteering, bridging gaps of age and attitude.\" </p> <p>The competition is held to celebrate Volunteers Week - now in its 15th year - which is run by the National Centre for Volunteering and which ends today. The idea behind Volunteers Week is to \"recognise, reward and recruit\" volunteers. Last year 15,000 organisations took part and 105,000 volunteers were presented with certificates to thank them for the work they had done over the year. </p> <p>For information on Volunteers Week, call the National Centre for Volunteering on 0207-520 8932.

There were photographs of volunteers involved in domestic care, which isn't normally an area which is featured in high-profile photographs - it can be a monotonous task. Photographs showed a very strong and happy relationship between the volunteers and the person being looked after, and a great feeling of enjoyment in the volunteering that was going on. Also, the photographs showed inter-generational volunteering, bridging gaps of age and attitude.\" The competition is held to celebrate Volunteers Week - now in its 15th year - which is run by the National Centre for Volunteering and which ends today. The idea behind Volunteers Week is to \"recognise, reward and recruit\" volunteers. Last year 15,000 organisations took part and 105,000 volunteers were presented with certificates to thank them for the work they had done over the year. For information on Volunteers Week, call the National Centre for Volunteering on 0207-520 8932. The website is: www.volunteersweek.org.uk",

Well, here's a different twist on that familiar theme: \"Fourteen-year-old boy with severe learning difficulties abandoned in London... social services urgently seek any information about the mystery boy, whose name is Kenny.\" </p> <p>It hardly seems possible in our age of databases that a child's past could be so impossible to trace, but that is the case with Kenny, who, for the past six months, has been in the care of a team of social workers in the London borough of Southwark. </p> <p>Last autumn, Kenny, who has severe learning difficulties and epilepsy, was brought to their offices by a man who claimed to be his uncle Victor. He said he couldn't cope with the child any longer: he'd only been meant to be looking after him for his mother while she was away on holiday in the US, but she hadn't returned. </p> <p>While the duty social worker was trying to assess the situation in a cramped interview room, \"Uncle Victor\", who said that both he and Kenny were Nigerian, left the room to fetch some papers from his car. After waiting 15 minutes, the alarm was sounded. Kenny had been abandoned. Victor never returned. </p> <p>The address Victor had given turned out to be false. The police ran a child protection check, but with no results. The ensuing hours were frantic. Ed Kopecky, who is Kenny's social worker, recalls the pandemonium: \"I don't think Kenny understood he'd been abandoned until very late in the day. I took him to a conference room and played with some toys with him while my colleagues were desperately ringing around, trying to find an emergency foster carer.\" </p> <p>It was only when he realised he'd be sleeping in a strange environment that Kenny's behaviour became noticeably disturbed. He refused to sleep and the foster carer felt she couldn't offer him the round-the-clock supervision he clearly needed. </p> <p>The following day, Kopecky found Kenny a place in a residential home outside London. Six months later, he's still there, and Southwark social services have taken the highly unusual step of seeking a court order to permit them to talk to the media about Kenny's case in the hope that the mystery might be solved. </p> <p>Chris Bull, director of Southwark social services, is keen to stress that they don't seek to punish anyone who may have been involved in Kenny's abandonment. \"We just want more information about Kenny's past life so we can help his development while he remains in care,\" he says. </p> <p>A confidential telephone information line has been set up and the hope is that someone, somewhere must know something about Kenny's history - be it a family friend, relative or care worker who has come into contact with him. They feel optimistic that this delicate strategy of publicising the case of a highly vulnerable child in care will bear fruit. </p> <p>The reason for their optimism is simple: Kenny is a delightful, unforgettable young person. He understands and speaks English and Yoruba, roughly to the level of an eight year old. He adores music and wearing sunglasses - any sunglasses he can get his hands on - and surveying himself in a mirror. And Kenny loves to clean: be it dustpan and brush, duster or vacuum cleaner, he automatically, almost ritualistically, tidies up at the residential home or at school, despite the best efforts of care workers and teachers. </p> <p>In an effort to explore the Nigerian dimension to Kenny's history, Southwark have appointed a Yoruba-speaking visitor who, having spent time with him, is certain that Kenny either grew up in Nigeria or lived among the Nigerian community in Britain prior to his abandonment. </p> <p>A few days after Kenny arrived on the doorstep of social services, a woman came into their offices, asking after him. She said she would call again, but she hasn't. All she left was an articulate letter, detailing his needs and food preferences. The letter movingly concludes: \"He's a good boy.

      "body": "<p>Heavily pregnant, Borca Sorina is frying a lunch of potato strips in pig fat on an open fire for her four children. One, pale and sick, lies asleep on a mattress on the concrete floor of the family home, a tarpaulin covered one-room shack. Two others play with sticks beyond the dusty back yard. The fourth wanders barefoot in the sand, digging his teeth into a raw onion. </p> <p>Suddenly, Borca drops the wooden spoon and gasps. Her waters have broken. The translator uses my mobile phone to call for an ambulance to come to Lumga Noua, \"New World\" - the Gypsy, or Roma, community in the industrial zone on the outskirts of the east-central Romanian town of Alba Iulia. The line is bad. \"Where did you say?\" asks the hospital receptionist. When she finally grasps that we want them to come to the Gypsies, she slams the phone down. We bundle Borca into our hire car and send her to hospital. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the screams of a dying pig belonging to Borca's next door neighbours, Adriana and Josif Roja, fill the street like the cries of a hysterical toddler. Adriana, a diabetic, concentratedly pulls out its steaming intestines. \"The doctor told me I must eat three times a day,\" she says. \"Slaughtering the pig is a last resort, but I've run out of insulin so what else can I do?\" </p> <p>For around 90% of Romania's estimated 1m to 1.5m Roma who live in varying degrees of poverty, death is never very far away. Members of the \"New World\" community gather round and spit out their problems as if no one has ever listened to them before. One woman's six-month-old boy was born with club feet and she needs 5m Lei (\u00a3166) for a simple operation that would change his life. Her husband is out collecting scrap metal for which he will get the equivalent of 1p per kilo. </p> <p>Although now a part of the \"new Europe\", the 2,000-strong Lumga Noua community seems closer to the favelas of Rio or the shanties of Jakarta and Manila. It has no water supply. Single low-watt light bulbs cast a yellow hue in the wattle and daub-style shacks, powered by electricity from a man up the road who has allowed them to tap into his line. Debilitating illnesses long-banished in the west, such as TB, hepatitis and typhoid, are well-known to the residents. \"We cannot send our children to school,\" says one mother, \"because we can't afford the books or to clothe them properly.\" </p> <p>Yet a few hundred miles to the south, the lifestyle of the 250 Gypsy families in the village of Buzescu, outside Alexandria, could hardly be more different. Huge aluminium, oriental-style tiered roofs, or \"turlas\", dominate the skyline. Adjacent garages house Mercedes and BMWs, and the three-storey homes boast marbled entrance halls leading to dozens of (largely empty) rooms filled with expensive kitsch, such as plastic lemon trees and large porcelain statues of Michael Jackson and Princess Diana. Mobile phones abound. </p> <p>The old traditions die hard though. In Buzescu, almost every house has its kitchen in a tent in the back garden, harking back to the days when every minute of the day was spent outside. Italian-tiled bathrooms lie unused in preference to privies decorated with flowery curtains in the backyards. </p> <p>Buzescu's bulibasha, or Roma leader, Marin Grinea Stoica, parks his oil tanker outside the Italian-style villa he shares with his wife and four generations of his family. Like all the men in the street, he describes himself as a businessman, but refuses to elaborate. \"We've always been upwardly mobile, even under communism - although we couldn't be ostentatious about our wealth in those days,\" he says. \"My family has continually upgraded - from a caravan to a Dacia and now to a Mercedes.\" </p> <p>The oil tanker serves the oil-pumping plant he has set up just down the road. He casually drops into the conversation that he also owns 10kg of gold. Asked how he would explain the gaping divide between his lifestyle and that of Lumga Noua's impoverished Roma, Stoica offers a reply Norman Tebbit would be proud of. \"The trick which they haven't grasped is to put your mind into action all the time,\" he says. \"When I was young I would lie awake all night thinking of ways in which I could feed the children next day, while others slept until 10 in the morning. So how can they expect to be on the same level?\" </p> <p>He cannot, he says, understand the couples from Tanderei, three hours' drive east of Bucharest, who recently went to England to earn money from begging and earned those back home such a bad press. \"But Roma will always go where the work is,\" he says. \"That's the bottom line, and that's the basis on which decisions are made.\" </p> <p>Talk to almost anyone from the Roma community and they will tell you that it simply makes economic sense for them to run the risks of travelling through Europe (Germany is the country most often mentioned.) And as an outsider looking into the poor communities, the risks seem quite reasonable. </p> <p>A few days spent among them quickly dispels the myths spread in the British press that sees them as \"scroungers\". Rich, poor, entrepreneurial, beggars, small-time merchants, olive-skinned, fair, black-haired and blonde, they defy stereotyping. They seem to be still trying to make sense of their position in the post-communist new world order which appears to have decided it has no place for Europe's fastest-growing ethnic group. </p> <p>Romania's Roma, which make up around 10-15% of the population, have survived by retreating into tight-knit tribal groups. They have become frequent targets for organised violence from the police. Racially-motivated murders have increased since 1990. The European Roma Rights Centre in Budapest has documented several cases of arson attacks where Romanian Roma have been burnt out of their homes. Now debate rages because many Romanians don't like the fact that \"Roma\" looks and sounds too much like \"Romanian\" and insist on using a new spelling to distinguish them from the dark-skinned citizens: Rroma. </p> <p>Despised in their own country, the Roma are largely psychologically detached from the modern world. The Kaldaras community of Sarulesti, 30 miles south-east of Bucharest, are poor but happy, living in their muddy, lilac tree-lined streets. Their community functions to its own rules. The bulibasha leads court sessions in cases of dispute and adjudicates when marriages are being arranged. A woman down the road checks that potential brides are virgins. The boys spend the day collecting scrap metal which they will sell for a decent price in Bucharest. </p> <p>The men wear \"designer\" labels - cheap fakes picked up at wholesale markets on the outskirts of the capital. The women, unsteady on bright green and orange platforms, don the traditional flowing flowered skirts, headscarves and wear their heavy gold-coin \"dowries\" woven into their plaits. </p> <p>Their aspirations appear to be modest. Talk to them about what motivated some Gypsies to travel to England and there is no mention of roads paved with gold. Lenuta, hobbling on pink platforms, squelches through the mud towards us. \"Take me to England! It must be a beautiful country with asphalt streets, because your shoes are so clean!\" </p> <p>Returning with his family from a horse-drawn scrap-metal search, Robert Mihai concentrates on smashing a brake pump with a hammer to extract the valuable ball-bearings. \"Where's England?\" he asks. \"Do you have mountains and sheep?\" I sketch a crude map of Europe and walk my fingers across the Channel. \"And where's Romania?\" he asks. He has no knowledge of the origins of Roma peoples, of the US president, the European Union (which his country hopes to join), or of the internet. On mention of the word computer, his brow furrows still further. \"Calculator?\" he says. \"I don't need a calculator. I can count my money in my head and that's all that matters.\" </p> <p>Others in the village who are lucky enough to go to school say the most important thing they'll ever learn there is maths. \"And reading,\" shouts 27-year-old Mihai Buzdugan, who never went to school. \"I have to send for my brother whenever there's an American film I want to watch, because I can't read the subtitles.\" </p> <p> The bulibasha, Florea Gogu Mihai, welcomes us into his home after we hand him an entry ticket: three bottles of tuica, or plum brandy. He remembers the days when he used to travel around with his parents in a horse and cart, before the communists forced them to settle. \"We're sorry we unlearnt how to travel,\" he says. </p> <p>Florin's community has clearly felt the forces of globalisation in its local form and he sees migration as a necessity for future generations. As a bulibasha, he says, he would have no problem encouraging it if it was the only way to survive. \"It's to do with the breakdown of our tradition,\" he says. \"Under communism we'd sell our buckets, pots, brandy distilleries and gold for wedding rings to non-Roma who were keen to buy them because they couldn't get them anywhere else. Our products are still the best, but there is a lot of cheaper stuff on the market now and we are being forced to travel where the work is.\" </p> <p>He recently met with the bulibasha from Tandarei, where the Britain-bound beggars came from. They discussed Britain's tightening of its policy against asylum seekers, which appears to have reached Roma leaders throughout the country. Then Florea shows me a copper coffee pot made by a villager. \"Do you think they'd buy those in England?\" he asks. \"If so, I can imagine the young people will be off there soon.\"</p>",

Florin's community has clearly felt the forces of globalisation in its local form and he sees migration as a necessity for future generations. As a bulibasha, he says, he would have no problem encouraging it if it was the only way to survive. \"It's to do with the breakdown of our tradition,\" he says. \"Under communism we'd sell our buckets, pots, brandy distilleries and gold for wedding rings to non-Roma who were keen to buy them because they couldn't get them anywhere else. Our products are still the best, but there is a lot of cheaper stuff on the market now and we are being forced to travel where the work is.\" He recently met with the bulibasha from Tandarei, where the Britain-bound beggars came from. They discussed Britain's tightening of its policy against asylum seekers, which appears to have reached Roma leaders throughout the country. Then Florea shows me a copper coffee pot made by a villager. \"Do you think they'd buy those in England?\" he asks. \"If so, I can imagine the young people will be off there soon.\"",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>There is now a strong push from the government for neighbourhood renewal and social inclusion, but it seems that the government's financial systems are perversely designed to exclude community groups from becoming actively involved. Much of the recent funding debate has been about the trend from grants to contracts. But perhaps the more pressing issue for community groups is the trend from funding organisations with core grants to just reimbursing project costs. </p> <p>In recent years, community and voluntary organisations in the UK have increasingly relied upon project-specific grants from public funds, both from the government and from the EU institutions. However, these project-specific funds have brought with them a new volume of accounting requirements, unlike any grants in the past. Previously, the monitoring of a grant would include, for example, sending the funder a copy of the annual audited accounts and of the annual report. Whereas now, we have reached the point where itemised quarterly claims for every receipt have to be inspected and accounted for. Is this really necessary? </p> <p>Within the UK, civil servants are keen to repeat their requirement that the proper financial control environment must be established. Partly, this need for a \"control environment\" comes from the years of sleaze when private gain from public funds was getting out of hand. It also comes from the EU institutions who have had a bad press in terms of fraud, and are very keen to show that they run the tightest system of all. Although senior civil servants are being told by ministers to find out what works, to take risks and be entrepreneurial, this new approach seems not to change how community groups can be funded. </p> <p>In the desire to be squeaky clean, have we forgotten our other objectives? Particularly when we have the strong suspicion that the smallest groups are given the hardest time. We can read how the Jubilee line in London overspent with millions of pounds of public funds, yet a community project will spend days putting together another claim or monitoring report for travelling costs, and has to justify to officials whether each training course was strictly necessary for their staff. </p> <p>Stopping fraud and waste of public funds is important - we would lose public support otherwise. But we now have a control culture which will reimburse the most ineffective but bureaucratically-correct project, yet take to task the inspirational project manager who forgets that childcare is to be counted under \"beneficiary costs\" and not under the \"other costs\" heading. </p> <p>So, if the only reason we have to live with this degree of control is to protect public funds from fraud, the key question should be - does it actually work in terms of detecting fraud without hindering good work? At best, we can say that the jury is still out on this question. There are many examples of slick organisations which have provided plausible spreadsheets and information to claim a grant. But, although we all agree that the system is not perfect in detecting fraud, the key choice is should we add even more detail, or should we think it through afresh? </p> <p>One of the key weaknesses of the reimbursement culture is that it asks the funder to audit the expenditure, but seldom talks to the community group's own auditor. This is particularly true for revenue grants, though less so for capital grants.

      "bodyText": "There is now a strong push from the government for neighbourhood renewal and social inclusion, but it seems that the government's financial systems are perversely designed to exclude community groups from becoming actively involved. Much of the recent funding debate has been about the trend from grants to contracts. But perhaps the more pressing issue for community groups is the trend from funding organisations with core grants to just reimbursing project costs. In recent years, community and voluntary organisations in the UK have increasingly relied upon project-specific grants from public funds, both from the government and from the EU institutions. However, these project-specific funds have brought with them a new volume of accounting requirements, unlike any grants in the past. Previously, the monitoring of a grant would include, for example, sending the funder a copy of the annual audited accounts and of the annual report. Whereas now, we have reached the point where itemised quarterly claims for every receipt have to be inspected and accounted for. Is this really necessary? Within the UK, civil servants are keen to repeat their requirement that the proper financial control environment must be established. Partly, this need for a \"control environment\" comes from the years of sleaze when private gain from public funds was getting out of hand. It also comes from the EU institutions who have had a bad press in terms of fraud, and are very keen to show that they run the tightest system of all. Although senior civil servants are being told by ministers to find out what works, to take risks and be entrepreneurial, this new approach seems not to change how community groups can be funded. In the desire to be squeaky clean, have we forgotten our other objectives? Particularly when we have the strong suspicion that the smallest groups are given the hardest time. We can read how the Jubilee line in London overspent with millions of pounds of public funds, yet a community project will spend days putting together another claim or monitoring report for travelling costs, and has to justify to officials whether each training course was strictly necessary for their staff. Stopping fraud and waste of public funds is important - we would lose public support otherwise. But we now have a control culture which will reimburse the most ineffective but bureaucratically-correct project, yet take to task the inspirational project manager who forgets that childcare is to be counted under \"beneficiary costs\" and not under the \"other costs\" heading. So, if the only reason we have to live with this degree of control is to protect public funds from fraud, the key question should be - does it actually work in terms of detecting fraud without hindering good work? At best, we can say that the jury is still out on this question. There are many examples of slick organisations which have provided plausible spreadsheets and information to claim a grant. But, although we all agree that the system is not perfect in detecting fraud, the key choice is should we add even more detail, or should we think it through afresh? One of the key weaknesses of the reimbursement culture is that it asks the funder to audit the expenditure, but seldom talks to the community group's own auditor. This is particularly true for revenue grants, though less so for capital grants. Indeed, it is sometimes surprisingly straightforward to get a massive capital grant, often only verified by formal certificates from an auditor and from a quantity surveyor. The treasurers of community groups already know how much detail they have to cope with. The charity commissioners have set out their own rules for the accounts, which it is commonly agreed would not kick in for the private sector until the company's turnover was into millions of pounds a year. These rules make it quite hard for community groups and voluntary organisations to find skilled finance staff, and now groups find they have even more work to do to meet project funding requirements.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It is often said that the inspiration for the government's big ideas on welfare reform have come from the US. Tonight, Michael Sherraden, a leading US social policy expert, is speaking alongside David Blunkett at an Institute for Public Policy Research lecture. He will offer a new policy agenda that ministers might want to import. </p> <p>Over recent years, much of cutting edge US and UK policy has focused on finding new ways of boosting the incomes of disadvantaged groups - particularly the working poor - through a range of tax credits. It is Sherraden's willingness to stray beyond this emphasis on \"income\" and focus on the distribution of financial assets - such as savings and investments - that makes him distinctive. </p> <p>At the moment, individual development accounts (Idas) are the most prominent form of \"asset-based welfare\" in the US. These are savings accounts into which contributions from individuals are more than matched by those from government. For every dollar saved by an individual the state may add another two, three, or more dollars (it varies across schemes). The funds accumulated within the Idas can help low-income people - those from households with income less than 80% of median income - to buy their first home, undertake post-compulsory education and training, or start their own company. </p> <p>The early evidence from Idas is that it can encourage people with modest incomes to acquire the saving habit and to plan ahead. These promising beginnings have led 27 states to pass legislation in the last few years allowing them to set up Ida schemes and it is estimated that well over 200 community-based Ida schemes are in existence. But it is important to keep this growth in perspective. The number of individuals benefiting from Idas is still limited. Despite the hype Idas are still small beer in terms of public spending. </p> <p>Their small scale is only one of the reasons why Idas are currently a policy without an enemy. Leftish Democrats are delighted to find a new way of supporting disadvantaged groups and relish the opportunity of rekindling the New Deal project of democratising wealth. Meanwhile, most Republicans purr with pleasure when Idas are sold to them as a way of promoting individual responsibility and spreading private ownership. Idas are one of those rare policies which allow both sides in politics to use their favourite rhetoric. The resulting bi-partisan support is evident in the savings for working families bill, currently under consideration in Congress. </p> <p>If and when asset-based policies start to have major implications for the public purse this consensus is likely to come under serious pressure. The signs are this may happen sooner rather than later. Some states are already drawing up plans for more ambitious asset policies such as Kidsave, which involves the state paying $1,000 into the account of each newborn child and making additional contributions over subsequent years. The cost implications of these proposals are of a different magnitude to those of Idas. </p> <p>The presidential race is also having an impact. Bill Clinton has fired some valedictory shots in the debate on the future of social security by restating his support for the creation of millions of universal savings accounts which would help low income individuals save for retirement as well as homes, learning and business start-ups. This has triggered Republican candidate George Bush to counter with his plan to convert the generous pay-as-you-go state pension into a funded pension system in which individual citizens take control of their own retirement accounts. Suddenly, everyone in American politics is adopting a position on the merits of different asset-based welfare strategies. </p> <p>All this makes Sherraden's visit to the UK a timely moment to consider the case for asset-based polices in the UK. The government's raft of measures aimed at boosting the incomes of disadvantaged groups can be contrasted with the absence of any serious measures aimed at promoting asset-building for those on low incomes. There is very little by way of substance behind the regular calls for \"wealth for the many\" and \"savings for all\". </p> <p>This is of greater concern due to the growing body of evidence which suggests that asset-ownership can have a powerful independent effect on a number of key social outcomes, such as labour market performance and health. Part of this simply reflects the fact that some life-choices - such as starting a new firm - require capital. But it also reflects the finding that owning capital appears to enhance people's sense of control and well-being. Add to this the fact that the ratio of households without any assets doubled between 1979-1996 and that 50% of people still have under \u00a3500 disposable financial wealth - and the case for a new policy agenda hardens. </p> <p>The answer cannot be to promote asset-building among low income groups through the traditional route of granting tax reliefs - the evidence from Peps, personal pensions and Isas suggests that this approach benefits the comfortable and does next to nothing for those with few or no assets. </p> <p> A bolder approach would see a second-term Labour administration committing itself to a range of asset-based policies. Here are two it could start with. First, it could set up a savings account for every newborn child - a \"baby bond\" as the IPPR has called it - with special endowments and matching contributions made for children from poorer families. The account would build up in value until the young adult accesses it when they reach 18. Second, Idas run by local community and voluntary groups could be targeted at adults in localities where there are particular problems with obtaining credit, starting businesses, and accessing training and learning. Both of these measures would go with the grain of the government's commitment to ending the spread of poverty across generations and attacking concentrated pockets of disadvantage. </p> <p>Proposals for other forms of asset-based policies will follow. As the government continues to search for new ways of making a reality of the promise of \"opportunity for all\" Michael Sherraden should find that his ideas receive a warm welcome. Perhaps it is time for a New Deal for savers. </p> <p>\u0095 Gavin Kelly is senior research fellow at the IPPR and is author, with Rachel Lissauer, of Ownership for All (published by IPPR; ISBN 186030 114 2; price \u00a34.95; available from Central Books, tel: 020-8986 5488).</p>",

      "bodyText": "It is often said that the inspiration for the government's big ideas on welfare reform have come from the US. Tonight, Michael Sherraden, a leading US social policy expert, is speaking alongside David Blunkett at an Institute for Public Policy Research lecture. He will offer a new policy agenda that ministers might want to import. Over recent years, much of cutting edge US and UK policy has focused on finding new ways of boosting the incomes of disadvantaged groups - particularly the working poor - through a range of tax credits. It is Sherraden's willingness to stray beyond this emphasis on \"income\" and focus on the distribution of financial assets - such as savings and investments - that makes him distinctive. At the moment, individual development accounts (Idas) are the most prominent form of \"asset-based welfare\" in the US. These are savings accounts into which contributions from individuals are more than matched by those from government. For every dollar saved by an individual the state may add another two, three, or more dollars (it varies across schemes). The funds accumulated within the Idas can help low-income people - those from households with income less than 80% of median income - to buy their first home, undertake post-compulsory education and training, or start their own company. The early evidence from Idas is that it can encourage people with modest incomes to acquire the saving habit and to plan ahead. These promising beginnings have led 27 states to pass legislation in the last few years allowing them to set up Ida schemes and it is estimated that well over 200 community-based Ida schemes are in existence. But it is important to keep this growth in perspective. The number of individuals benefiting from Idas is still limited. Despite the hype Idas are still small beer in terms of public spending. Their small scale is only one of the reasons why Idas are currently a policy without an enemy. Leftish Democrats are delighted to find a new way of supporting disadvantaged groups and relish the opportunity of rekindling the New Deal project of democratising wealth. Meanwhile, most Republicans purr with pleasure when Idas are sold to them as a way of promoting individual responsibility and spreading private ownership. Idas are one of those rare policies which allow both sides in politics to use their favourite rhetoric. The resulting bi-partisan support is evident in the savings for working families bill, currently under consideration in Congress. If and when asset-based policies start to have major implications for the public purse this consensus is likely to come under serious pressure. The signs are this may happen sooner rather than later. Some states are already drawing up plans for more ambitious asset policies such as Kidsave, which involves the state paying $1,000 into the account of each newborn child and making additional contributions over subsequent years. The cost implications of these proposals are of a different magnitude to those of Idas. The presidential race is also having an impact. Bill Clinton has fired some valedictory shots in the debate on the future of social security by restating his support for the creation of millions of universal savings accounts which would help low income individuals save for retirement as well as homes, learning and business start-ups. This has triggered Republican candidate George Bush to counter with his plan to convert the generous pay-as-you-go state pension into a funded pension system in which individual citizens take control of their own retirement accounts. Suddenly, everyone in American politics is adopting a position on the merits of different asset-based welfare strategies. All this makes Sherraden's visit to the UK a timely moment to consider the case for asset-based polices in the UK. The government's raft of measures aimed at boosting the incomes of disadvantaged groups can be contrasted with the absence of any serious measures aimed at promoting asset-building for those on low incomes. There is very little by way of substance behind the regular calls for \"wealth for the many\" and \"savings for all\". This is of greater concern due to the growing body of evidence which suggests that asset-ownership can have a powerful independent effect on a number of key social outcomes, such as labour market performance and health. Part of this simply reflects the fact that some life-choices - such as starting a new firm - require capital. But it also reflects the finding that owning capital appears to enhance people's sense of control and well-being. Add to this the fact that the ratio of households without any assets doubled between 1979-1996 and that 50% of people still have under \u00a3500 disposable financial wealth - and the case for a new policy agenda hardens. The answer cannot be to promote asset-building among low income groups through the traditional route of granting tax reliefs - the evidence from Peps, personal pensions and Isas suggests that this approach benefits the comfortable and does next to nothing for those with few or no assets. A bolder approach would see a second-term Labour administration committing itself to a range of asset-based policies. Here are two it could start with. First, it could set up a savings account for every newborn child - a \"baby bond\" as the IPPR has called it - with special endowments and matching contributions made for children from poorer families. The account would build up in value until the young adult accesses it when they reach 18. Second, Idas run by local community and voluntary groups could be targeted at adults in localities where there are particular problems with obtaining credit, starting businesses, and accessing training and learning. Both of these measures would go with the grain of the government's commitment to ending the spread of poverty across generations and attacking concentrated pockets of disadvantage. Proposals for other forms of asset-based policies will follow. As the government continues to search for new ways of making a reality of the promise of \"opportunity for all\" Michael Sherraden should find that his ideas receive a warm welcome. Perhaps it is time for a New Deal for savers. \u0095 Gavin Kelly is senior research fellow at the IPPR and is author, with Rachel Lissauer, of Ownership for All (published by IPPR; ISBN 186030 114 2; price \u00a34.95; available from Central Books, tel: 020-8986 5488).",

The scale of the recovery is impressive and offers the prospect that a mountainous backlog - at one time, more than 100,000 cases - could be reduced to what is officially termed \"frictional\" levels by the end of next year. </p> <p>Roche is in no doubt that the asylum backlog has been one of the key reasons why 1999 saw a record 79,000 applications to Britain. \"A major pull factor - especially if you are talking about organised crime - can clearly be that you go to the back of a very long queue,\" she says. \"Well, the message is getting out that 'No you don't now'. The backlog continues to fall and is now 94,540.\" </p> <p>Applications from Poland and the Czech Republic have fallen sharply as a result of a widespread media campaign in eastern Europe about Britain's new tougher asylum law. And the opening of the Oakington rapid processing camp, near Cambridge, has ensured that applying for asylum doesn't mean joining the end of that long queue. In its first two months, 300 asylum seekers and their families were sent to Oakington. Some 205 have been refused asylum, three have been given refugee status and three allowed to remain in Britain on exceptional grounds. Some 172 applicants have appealed, and the appeals, if they are certified, will be heard within three weeks. So far, all those appeals heard to completion have been dismissed. </p> <p>Roche says that this initial record disproves the claims of those who argued such a fast-track procedure would be unfair. \"It was said that if you had a quick decision-making process that would affect the quality of decisions,\" she says. \"The fact that cases were taking ages before a decision was made wasn't because case workers were poring over them; it was because they were sitting on a dusty shelf somewhere, which was doing nobody any good.\" </p> <p>As MP for the north London constituency of Hornsey and Wood Green, Roche says: \"I am unique among immigration ministers in that I have one of the highest immigration and asylum caseloads in the country,\" she says. \"When I do a surgery, 80% of the cases are about immigration and asylum.\" </p> <p>Roche also makes clear that contingency plans, leaked to the Guardian last month, for the mass detention of asylum seekers in army camps in the event of a sudden surge this summer no longer exist.

A lot of the problems which had emerged, she says, were the result of London boroughs, such as Westminster and Wandsworth, and Kent councils placing asylum seekers with all sorts of landlords in all sorts of places. </p> <p>Roche says: \"It was done in a completely uncoordinated way, with no thought for language groups, and it had a knock-on effect in terms of shortage of facilities.\" Among the problems are poor landlords and difficulties getting refugee children into schools. </p> <p>The minister says that contracts with the local authority regional consortia to provide accommodation outside London will be signed soon and the dispersal scheme - currently operating for only 40% of asylum seekers after its full introduction was postponed in April - will be fully implemented this autumn. </p> <p>The immigration and nationality directorate of the Home Office reckons that, after all appeals and other procedures are taken into account, about 34% of all asylum seekers are given some sort of official status to remain in Britain. </p> <p>Roche says that she wishes more attention was paid to the problems of integrating those who are recognised as refugees.

      "bodyText": "Nato today dismissed accusations by Amnesty International that it committed war crimes during its air war against Kosovo and Serbia. Jamie Shea, Nato's chief spokesman, said that cases when civilians were killed were due to technological failure or \"the accidents of conflict\" - not because Nato had failed to take all necessary precautions. \"Each target that Nato struck was approved by a team of government lawyers and we attacked in such a way as to minimise the prospects of civilian casualties,\" he said. \"We never said we would avoid casualties. It would be foolhardy to say that, as no military operation in history has been perfect. He argued that the costs of the conflict had to weighed against the thousands of Kosovan Albanians who would be dead without Nato intervention. Pressed on the bombing of a Serb TV station in which several civilians were killed, Mr Shea said: \"The television station was attacked because it was not the BBC or CNN, it was being used to push out propaganda and to create a climate of hatred in which the persecution of Albanians could be accepted as normal by the greater majority of the Serb population.\" In its 60-page report, Amnesty said allied commanders should have taken greater precautions to avoid civilian deaths. Brendan Paddy of Amnesty said: \"Our conclusion was that in a number of incidents they did not take sufficient precautions to prevent civilian casualties. As a result there were inevitable and unlawful civilian deaths.\" The attack on the Serbian state television station was a \"grave breach of the laws of war\" and Nato \"therefore committed a war crime\", Mr Paddy said, adding: \"What they have done was deliberately target a civilian facility and 16 civilians were killed as a result.\" The report also criticised the Nato attack on a civilian convoy at Djakovica on April 14 last year. \"We are saying that Nato did not take necessary precautions and did not positively identify the target before firing on it,\" Mr Paddy said. \"In particular that was a result of flying at 15,000 feet in order to ensure pilots' safety. That, of course, compromised the safety of civilians on the ground.\" Most cases discussed in the 60-page report contravened the first protocol of the Geneva Convention, which prohibited attacks on civilians, he said. Amnesty said that in some other attacks, such as on the rail bridge at Grdelica on April 12, Nato did not suspend bombing after it was evident that civilians were struck. Mr Shea said the Amnesty report was less authoritative than that of the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, which concluded that Nato had committed no violations of international law. \"I have great respect for Amnesty, but their usual business is conducting inquiries into prisoners of conscience, and I think they have strayed a little bit beyond their turf in investigating military actions by Nato,\" he added. In another report released today, the Labour-controlled foreign affairs select committee concluded that Nato's bombing of Kosovo was of \"dubious legality\". The cross-party committee said Operation Allied Force was contrary to the \"basic law of the international community\" - the United Nations Charter. However the committee said that the Nato action was justified on moral grounds because of Mr Milosevic's repression of the Kosovan Albanians. It accepted that the alliance went as far as possible to make its military intervention comply with international law, faced with the veto of Russia and China in the UN Security Council. The report also queries whether the bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade was a genuine mistake as Nato claims. The committee received evidence that the Americans deliberately targeted the embassy on the grounds that it was a telecommunications post passing on information to the Serbian regime about Nato's bombing campaign.",

It looks at demographic trends - the ageing population, more single person households and teleworking, and assesses the challenge ahead for voluntary organisations. </p> <p> The report's author, Gavin Mensah-Coker, of Demos, says that in an increasingly diverse and atomised society, volunteering could help to reduce social exclusion.

      "trailText": "<p>Plans to link social housing rents to property prices will create huge anomalies between the north and south, argues Bill Payne</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>As Sir Humphrey might have said in response to the housing green paper proposal to link local authority and housing association rents to house prices, \"A very bold decision, if I may say so minister.\" </p> <p>These social landlords charge affordable, below-market rents for low-income households. Unlike private sector landlords, they do not seek to maximise rents to market levels. Nick Raynsford, the housing minister, is well informed on his subject, but it is hard to believe that this proposal has been properly thought out. </p> <p>Linking rents to house prices makes very little sense for a national housing strategy. House price rises in the south are headline news and cause the Bank of England to increase interest rates; at the same time, good quality homes in former coal mining communities in South Yorkshire can still be bought for well below \u00a35,000. </p> <p>The government intends to restructure rents so they are set on an objective basis - which tenants and landlords must welcome as being fairer than the current system, which can lead to considerable anomalies, with tenants often paying significantly different rents for similar properties in similar locations. At first sight, linking rents to property values appears to be a reasonable policy. But there are two flaws which may make this proposal unworkable. </p> <p>First, it will increase the differentials in rents between the south and north. Rents in the south - already far higher than in the north - will be forced up, while there will be substantial falls in northern rents. Initial inquiries from the Chartered Institute of Housing suggest that housing association rents based solely on capital values could increase in London by more than a third; but in Yorkshire and Humberside, they could fall by more than a fifth. Substantial rises in rents in London could make it even harder for schools to find teachers and leave inner city hospitals unable to find cleaning staff for love nor money. </p> <p>Second, housing associations will be dramatically affected: some may not survive the proposed changes. Running costs between north and south do not vary as much as property values, so housing associations in the south would make significant surpluses, while those in the north will find their viability threatened. </p> <p>To deal with this problem, the minister has suggested that southern housing associations should take over those in the north. But would our southern cousins, with their higher property values and rents, be keen to merge with their poorer northern relatives just to keep them viable? </p> <p> Tenants might not be keen on this suggestion either. A leading tenants' group member in Rotherham told us that \"a big southern landlord wouldn't have any interest in the slightest in what we want in our area. It'd all be about figures on the balance sheet. At the moment, there's a local focus - that's why we're called South Yorkshire Housing Association. We like it because that's where we live: South Yorkshire - not in London or anywhere else.\" </p> <p>Housing associations are key organisations in tackling social exclusion; this needs local strategic partnerships, increased accountability and sensitivity to local needs for regenerating deprived communities. No minister! The regeneration of Sheffield or Newcastle simply cannot be directed from Notting Hill. </p> <p>We think that the government will ultimately recognise that capital values are far less helpful than a more sophisticated relationship with tenant incomes. A link with capital values alone would have serious consequences. There would be a massive rent rise - and corresponding increases in housing benefit - for housing association tenants in the south. While in the north, vulnerable housing associations would be unable to deliver the green paper's objectives and the government's social exclusion agenda. </p> <p>It is early days for detailed responses to the green paper, but the red herring of linking capital values to rents needs to be consigned to the bin. Delivering good quality homes at a price people can afford should be the focus of these deliberations. We believe that the temptation to use an easy index like house prices, which would lead to adverse outcomes, cannot be allowed to happen. The key issue is what people on low incomes can afford to pay. Even concocting a formula linking rent levels both to incomes and capital values will only modify the nonsense. Please think again, minister.</p> <p>\u0095 Bill Payne is chief executive of the Yorkshire Housing Association.</p>",

Initial inquiries from the Chartered Institute of Housing suggest that housing association rents based solely on capital values could increase in London by more than a third; but in Yorkshire and Humberside, they could fall by more than a fifth. Substantial rises in rents in London could make it even harder for schools to find teachers and leave inner city hospitals unable to find cleaning staff for love nor money. Second, housing associations will be dramatically affected: some may not survive the proposed changes. Running costs between north and south do not vary as much as property values, so housing associations in the south would make significant surpluses, while those in the north will find their viability threatened. To deal with this problem, the minister has suggested that southern housing associations should take over those in the north. But would our southern cousins, with their higher property values and rents, be keen to merge with their poorer northern relatives just to keep them viable? Tenants might not be keen on this suggestion either. A leading tenants' group member in Rotherham told us that \"a big southern landlord wouldn't have any interest in the slightest in what we want in our area. It'd all be about figures on the balance sheet. At the moment, there's a local focus - that's why we're called South Yorkshire Housing Association. We like it because that's where we live: South Yorkshire - not in London or anywhere else.\" Housing associations are key organisations in tackling social exclusion; this needs local strategic partnerships, increased accountability and sensitivity to local needs for regenerating deprived communities. No minister! The regeneration of Sheffield or Newcastle simply cannot be directed from Notting Hill. We think that the government will ultimately recognise that capital values are far less helpful than a more sophisticated relationship with tenant incomes. A link with capital values alone would have serious consequences. There would be a massive rent rise - and corresponding increases in housing benefit - for housing association tenants in the south. While in the north, vulnerable housing associations would be unable to deliver the green paper's objectives and the government's social exclusion agenda. It is early days for detailed responses to the green paper, but the red herring of linking capital values to rents needs to be consigned to the bin. Delivering good quality homes at a price people can afford should be the focus of these deliberations. We believe that the temptation to use an easy index like house prices, which would lead to adverse outcomes, cannot be allowed to happen. The key issue is what people on low incomes can afford to pay. Even concocting a formula linking rent levels both to incomes and capital values will only modify the nonsense. Please think again, minister. \u0095 Bill Payne is chief executive of the Yorkshire Housing Association.",

The Sun believes that the England midfielder has \"put himself in the Euro 2000 shop window\", while the Daily Mail believes Sunderland, Celtic, Coventry and Celta Vigo would be keen to snap up the 26-year-old when his contract runs out next summer. Aston Villa are to move for Turkish superstar Hakan Sukur, who is surprisingly available for transfer under the Bosman ruling. The Sun believes that John Gregory was ready to pay \u00a35m for Sukur before he realised the striker's contract had run out. They quote Sukur as saying: \"I want to further my career playing abroad and England would be my first choice.\" Planet Football expects Christian Karembeu to sign for Middlesbrough, after he turned down a late attempt from Arsenal to sign him as a replacement for Lee Dixon. \"My true place is in midfield,\" he told the site. \"Now I have a great chance to play in the Premier League.\" Planet Football also suggests that Juninho could be set to leave the Riverside after he confessed an interest in joining Benfica. \"If an interest from Benfica really does exist then the only thing I can say is that Benfica is a great club, where any player would like to play. Everything is possible, I have to talk and I am available to do this. It is a hypothesis that pleases me,\" the Brazilian was quoted as saying, rather long-windedly.

Thrashing around for issues which will mark him out as less liberal than the illiberal Labour government, he has seized on the word 'liberal' itself as a term of abuse. Nothing new in that of course. Like most ideas in contemporary British public life, it has been imported unaltered from America, where liberals are objects of vituperative rightwing, redneck scorn. Liberals like high taxes and bureaucracy. They threaten individual freedom and undermine tradition. This conservative mantra has a powerful appeal in the USA, where government itself has ever been an object of suspicion. In Britain, with its very different political tradition of venerating the established order, it is decidedly odd for a Conservative like Hague to attack what he calls a 'liberal elite'. Elitism, for goodness sake, is what the Tories have been in the business of promoting for 300 years, ever since they evolved as the party of King and Church. As for the supposedly liberal establishment against which Hague feebly rails, there is nothing remotely liberal or Liberal about it. Here I declare an interest: I am a card-carrying Liberal Democrat. I am very happy to be called a liberal, with or without a capital. But I don't care to be associated by Hague, or anyone else, with a governing clique which has proved less liberal than any other in my regrettably lengthy lifetime. Indeed both big parties, having abandoned their own traditions, seem intent on a contest of illiberalism. They both defend our rotten voting system and other clapped out institutions, they both use disgraceful language about asylum seekers and other immigrants, they both are scared witless of Europe, they both bang the law 'n' order drum, and they both have no time for freedom of information. Most importantly of all, they are both in thrall to big business. The Liberal Democrats, with their unfortunate instinct for caution and incremental change, may be tarred to some extent with the same brush. But real liberals, or Liberals, have no truck with the squalid current order. Real liberals believe in liberty. In a truly liberal society, people would not just be free to make pots of money, which is our crabbed and narrow modern interpretation of freedom. They would be free of want and ignorance and injustice. Those who believe in such things should, on balance, be happy that Hague attacks them. For as his own party disintegrates, and the ruling clique transforms itself, Animal Farm-like, into the new Tory establishment, there is at least a glimmer of opportunity for the reassertion of liberal values. Among them is the far from radical notion that government should reflect the wishes of the electorate. Another is that parties which aspire to govern, should believe in governing rather than handing over power to unaccountable financiers and corporate tycoons. And yet another is a fundamental respect for human rights and the dignity of freedom from fear, exploitation, and inequality. If that is liberalism, than I for one am for it. And if Hague is against it, he should tell us why in his next sound bite. Useful links The Liberal International Liberalism in America Anti-liberalism in America",

      "byline": "Maggie O'Kane",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Today's Amnesty International report on the conduct of the war in Kosovo last year, makes a number of criticisms of Nato's conduct. The most important are that:</p> <p>\u0095 Nato bombers flew too high to protect themselves and could not discriminate between bombing Serb civilians and bombing the Serb military;</p> <p>\u0095 Nato did not abandon key bombing raids on passenger trains and refugee convoys when it realised the victims were civilians;</p> <p>\u0095 The bomb attack on a television station - even one that was used for war propaganda purposes - was a war crime.</p> <p>Yes. These are valid criticisms.</p> <p>Amnesty International points out Nato's failures. Nato needs to acknowledge and explain, for example, its decision to fly at 15,000ft, making it impossible for pilots to see if they were targeting civilians. This policy helped bring the death toll among Serb civilians to between 1,000 and 1,500 - and that does not include the thousands of conscripted soldiers blasted by Nato's bombs.</p> <p>But that does not mean that then history of the war has to be rewritten as a failure. The aim of Nato intervention was to bring the refugees home. That was a success. Perhaps the price was too high but the world has already paid a preposterous price for not standing up to the Serbia president, Slobodan Milosevic, eight years ago in Bosnia.</p> <p>Nato belatedly reversed the consequences of a diplomatic disaster and brought hundreds of thousands of Kosovan Albanians home from the mountains. Milosevic's position is much weakened by the defeat and some analysts suggest that he may be gone in a year.</p> <p>There are always, and there should always be detractors when it comes to war. It is always the weakest, the poorest and the innocent who suffer most. Among the anti-war voices raised over Kosovo were Harold Pinter's and John Pilger's. But I would like one of them to explain how else the world could have forced Milosevic to allow the Kosovans home? What do you do with a million and a half refugees banished by foot and by cattle trucks to the mountainside or into neighbouring countries that do not want them?</p> <p>If the Kosovo issue had not been swept under the negotiating table in 1995 at Dayton, Ohio, it would have not descended into the hell it did last year. But equally, those who spent weeks at the Dayton air base trying to bring peace to Bosnia insist that to try and solve the problem at that moment would have meant an end to the peace talks for Bosnia.</p> <p>Kosovo was a failure of diplomacy - war always is. Force appeared to be the only option - not just to bring the Kosovans home but for the world to finally say to Milosevic: \"You can't go on destroying. If you do, you will be destroyed.\" As Amnesty has rightly pointed out, the use of that force was sometimes flawed.</p> <p>The other stick that the detractors use to batter Nato is the suggestion that the whole basis for the war was fabricated.</p> <p>It is true that the Kosovo Liberation Army provoked the Serb police and military, but dismissing the Kosovo repression as Serbia trying to control a few murderous paramilitaries is to ignore ten years growing tension and repression of in Kosovo. It was inevitable that after the years of repression, the Kosovans would eventually hit back - drawing Nato in as their final tactic and only strategy of for survival. Nato finally stood up to the Milosevic. The Kosovan people paid a terrible price for it in the backlash that followed the bombing - and the Serb people also paid dearly as Nato made sure its priorities were for its pilots to be safe and bombed civilians.</p> <p>It is wrong of Nato to suggest the bombing did not unleash a new and much more ferocious attack on the people of Kosovo. It did, and those of us who spoke to the people left behind as the Serbs withdrew know that things got far worse when the bombing started.</p> <p>But six months before Nato bombed, Serb paramilitaries had been in Kosovo organising the \"cleansing\" of Kosovan civilians from certain areas. Mr Milosevic was preparing to use the suppression of Kosovo as another desperate crutch to stay in power.</p> <p>And finally, who created the Kosovo Liberation Army? It is like the Boston judge who was removed from the bench for asking a battered woman: \"What did you do to make him beat you?\"</p> <p>Just months after the war, the revisionism began in earnest. The Spectator published a long article arguing that Nato propaganda exaggerated the numbed of dead to get the war going. The war crimes tribunal digging in Kosovo expects to find at least 5,500 bodies.</p> <p>What is this brutal numbers game? Tell the mothers I interviewed in the coffee shop in Suva Reek, who had their children shot dead in front of them, that enough of their children were not dead. Does it take 10,000 to make a genocide charge stick? Does 5,500 not suffice?</p> <p>The then-defence secretary, George Robertson, claimed that 100,000 people were missing. It is now clear that it was part of the military hype in the run-up to the bombing campaign. Nato was attempting to garner international public support for the military action. Yes, he was exaggerating. You could even call it lying - the sort of lying that involves stretching an unlikely possibility into fact.</p> <p>He used the same tactics that General Colin Powell used to help build public support for the war against Iraq when he produced fake photographs of an Iraqi tank build-up poised to invade Saudi Arabia. These propaganda excesses should be curbed. But Nato's excessive spinning and cowardly tactics do not mean that its reasons to go to war should be dismissed.</p> <p>As you read this, the Serb general Radislav Krstic is on trial in the Hague for the alleged murder of 7,000 Muslim men in a three-day massacre at Srebenica in July 95. So perhaps Robertson could be excused some creative rallying.</p> <p>What puzzles me most is what drives our dissenters? Colleagues such as Robert Fisk of the Independent accuse the media of being mouthpieces for Nato. Yet they cannot answer the question of how else the \"ethnic cleansing\" was to be reversed. How else did the world finally stand up to Milosevic.</p> <p>In the sixties the anti-war voices of Kosovo were anti-bomb and anti-imperialist; in the seventies they were anti-Vietnam and in the nineties and today they are anti-Nato. Is it a question of always having to shout at teacher? Always being the kid to stamp their feet in class?</p> <p>Are they so insecure about their own journalistic identities that they have become knee-jerk anti-consensus voices, without even examining the consensus?</p> <p>Sometimes, blasphemous as it might seem, to the Angry Young Men, governments can occasionally try to get things right. Britain and the rather grudgingly the U.S. did lead the stand against Milosevic. There were many things wrong with the way they chose to do it and too many Serbs suffered. But at least after 10 years of bullying he was finally taken on.</p> <p>The press pastes governments for getting it wrong. We also have a duty for acknowledging when they try to get it right.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Today's Amnesty International report on the conduct of the war in Kosovo last year, makes a number of criticisms of Nato's conduct. The most important are that: \u0095 Nato bombers flew too high to protect themselves and could not discriminate between bombing Serb civilians and bombing the Serb military; \u0095 Nato did not abandon key bombing raids on passenger trains and refugee convoys when it realised the victims were civilians; \u0095 The bomb attack on a television station - even one that was used for war propaganda purposes - was a war crime. Yes. These are valid criticisms. Amnesty International points out Nato's failures. Nato needs to acknowledge and explain, for example, its decision to fly at 15,000ft, making it impossible for pilots to see if they were targeting civilians. This policy helped bring the death toll among Serb civilians to between 1,000 and 1,500 - and that does not include the thousands of conscripted soldiers blasted by Nato's bombs. But that does not mean that then history of the war has to be rewritten as a failure. The aim of Nato intervention was to bring the refugees home. That was a success. Perhaps the price was too high but the world has already paid a preposterous price for not standing up to the Serbia president, Slobodan Milosevic, eight years ago in Bosnia. Nato belatedly reversed the consequences of a diplomatic disaster and brought hundreds of thousands of Kosovan Albanians home from the mountains. Milosevic's position is much weakened by the defeat and some analysts suggest that he may be gone in a year. There are always, and there should always be detractors when it comes to war. It is always the weakest, the poorest and the innocent who suffer most. Among the anti-war voices raised over Kosovo were Harold Pinter's and John Pilger's. But I would like one of them to explain how else the world could have forced Milosevic to allow the Kosovans home? What do you do with a million and a half refugees banished by foot and by cattle trucks to the mountainside or into neighbouring countries that do not want them? If the Kosovo issue had not been swept under the negotiating table in 1995 at Dayton, Ohio, it would have not descended into the hell it did last year. But equally, those who spent weeks at the Dayton air base trying to bring peace to Bosnia insist that to try and solve the problem at that moment would have meant an end to the peace talks for Bosnia. Kosovo was a failure of diplomacy - war always is. Force appeared to be the only option - not just to bring the Kosovans home but for the world to finally say to Milosevic: \"You can't go on destroying. If you do, you will be destroyed.\" As Amnesty has rightly pointed out, the use of that force was sometimes flawed. The other stick that the detractors use to batter Nato is the suggestion that the whole basis for the war was fabricated. It is true that the Kosovo Liberation Army provoked the Serb police and military, but dismissing the Kosovo repression as Serbia trying to control a few murderous paramilitaries is to ignore ten years growing tension and repression of in Kosovo. It was inevitable that after the years of repression, the Kosovans would eventually hit back - drawing Nato in as their final tactic and only strategy of for survival. Nato finally stood up to the Milosevic. The Kosovan people paid a terrible price for it in the backlash that followed the bombing - and the Serb people also paid dearly as Nato made sure its priorities were for its pilots to be safe and bombed civilians. It is wrong of Nato to suggest the bombing did not unleash a new and much more ferocious attack on the people of Kosovo. It did, and those of us who spoke to the people left behind as the Serbs withdrew know that things got far worse when the bombing started. But six months before Nato bombed, Serb paramilitaries had been in Kosovo organising the \"cleansing\" of Kosovan civilians from certain areas. Mr Milosevic was preparing to use the suppression of Kosovo as another desperate crutch to stay in power. And finally, who created the Kosovo Liberation Army? It is like the Boston judge who was removed from the bench for asking a battered woman: \"What did you do to make him beat you?\" Just months after the war, the revisionism began in earnest. The Spectator published a long article arguing that Nato propaganda exaggerated the numbed of dead to get the war going. The war crimes tribunal digging in Kosovo expects to find at least 5,500 bodies. What is this brutal numbers game? Tell the mothers I interviewed in the coffee shop in Suva Reek, who had their children shot dead in front of them, that enough of their children were not dead. Does it take 10,000 to make a genocide charge stick? Does 5,500 not suffice? The then-defence secretary, George Robertson, claimed that 100,000 people were missing. It is now clear that it was part of the military hype in the run-up to the bombing campaign. Nato was attempting to garner international public support for the military action. Yes, he was exaggerating. You could even call it lying - the sort of lying that involves stretching an unlikely possibility into fact. He used the same tactics that General Colin Powell used to help build public support for the war against Iraq when he produced fake photographs of an Iraqi tank build-up poised to invade Saudi Arabia. These propaganda excesses should be curbed. But Nato's excessive spinning and cowardly tactics do not mean that its reasons to go to war should be dismissed. As you read this, the Serb general Radislav Krstic is on trial in the Hague for the alleged murder of 7,000 Muslim men in a three-day massacre at Srebenica in July 95. So perhaps Robertson could be excused some creative rallying. What puzzles me most is what drives our dissenters? Colleagues such as Robert Fisk of the Independent accuse the media of being mouthpieces for Nato. Yet they cannot answer the question of how else the \"ethnic cleansing\" was to be reversed. How else did the world finally stand up to Milosevic. In the sixties the anti-war voices of Kosovo were anti-bomb and anti-imperialist; in the seventies they were anti-Vietnam and in the nineties and today they are anti-Nato. Is it a question of always having to shout at teacher? Always being the kid to stamp their feet in class? Are they so insecure about their own journalistic identities that they have become knee-jerk anti-consensus voices, without even examining the consensus? Sometimes, blasphemous as it might seem, to the Angry Young Men, governments can occasionally try to get things right. Britain and the rather grudgingly the U.S. did lead the stand against Milosevic. There were many things wrong with the way they chose to do it and too many Serbs suffered. But at least after 10 years of bullying he was finally taken on. The press pastes governments for getting it wrong. We also have a duty for acknowledging when they try to get it right.",

Engineering and design skills \"that we understand are very strong in the UK\", were in demand. \"China is still considered an archaic country which only makes cheap plastic toys. In reality, like other countries in the Far East, China is becoming more service-oriented.\" Firms that build ties with the many family-run manufacturers in China could avoid head-to-head battles with US multinationals investing heavily in the country.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The first time I was sure that I was about to die was when I heard the Catholics coming for us from the other side of the river. It wasn't unusual to hear the occasional gunshot from the Bogside or the Creggan, the two big Catholic estates on the \"city side\" of Derry. We were used to things going bang in the night, the odd dull thud of a bomb or a crackle of gunshots echoing across the river Foyle to the nice middle-class Protestant area where my family lived.</p> <p>But this was different. The sounds of imminent massacre were unmistakable, weapons being fired in the air in gleeful bloodlust. I clung to my bunk bed, sick with terror. It was only when I finally scrambled downstairs to my mother's cool, comforting laughter that I realised I had been listening to a firework display.</p> <p>Childhood terrors were of a different scale when you grew up in Derry in the late 70s. As well as bogeymen and bed bugs, we had the Catholics to keep us awake at night. No one really lived their life in a state of permanent fear, apart from those whose dads were in the police (and we all knew who they were). But even as I approached my teens, there was a feeling that the only way the \"Troubles\" could be resolved would be through one side slaughtering the other. Everyone knew the Catholics were going to outbreed us at some point, but the British, we trusted, would never let Northern Ireland go back to the Irish. The IRA would be forced to massacre us in our beds.</p> <p>Thirteen years after I left Derry at the age of 14, I am bewildered by the opinions I held as a child. My parents, good Protestant folk who were as liberal as it was possible to be in those times, had raised us without the smallest trace of animosity towards the Catholic people who shared the city with us. But despite their best efforts, we were inevitably infected by sectarianism. It was part of the air you breathed in Ulster, it hung in the soft, drizzly rain. Casual slaughter was part of the routine rhythm of life, after all: even today many of my childhood memories are bound up with atrocities. I went to Omagh the day that Lord Mountbatten was blown up. A friend's mother died the day two soldiers were battered to death at a Belfast funeral. I had my last cello lesson the day a loyalist gunman killed three at another funeral.</p> <p>It is this mad little world that observers have to try to enter if they want to understand Northern Ireland's tentative progress towards peace. How, I wondered, had the Ulster Unionist party's narrow vote to re-enter Northern Ireland's executive government played in Nelson Drive and in Lincoln Courts and in Irish Street? What would my friend Andrea McDaid, who had talked with me late into the night about the coming massacre, make of it? What about the girls who taught me songs about burning the Pope in the back of the minibus on the way to hockey matches?</p> <p>I wanted to go back to Derry, to talk to the people I had grown up with and who, unlike me, had stayed. I had moved to a school in Belfast, decided I was really a nationalist, and taken off to university in England, looking over my shoulder with the mix of romanticism, guilt and disgust that characterises Irish exiles the world over. It was a philosophical conversion rather than one based on any experience - I made my first real Catholic friend at university in England. But as the ties of fearful religion loosened, I realised that identifying with Ireland rather than Ulster had its own attractions. The devil did have the best tunes after all. But what about those who stayed?</p> <p>If Northern Ireland is a weird little place, Derry must be one of its weirdest corners. Tucked up in the north-west corner of the province, right on the border with the Irish republic, it is the second biggest city in Ulster, but still fits neatly into a chest-tighteningly beautiful lough valley under the soft hills of Donegal. The ancient Irish town of Doire became Londonderry in the early 17th century, when several wealthy London trades guilds invested heavily in the new Protestant citadel. (The fraught issue of how to refer to the city still exercises the minds of the country's brightest and best. This paper's style is to call it \"Londonderry\", Protestants all over Northern Ireland insist on nothing less, but almost everyone in the city, from both sides, refers to it as \"Derry\".)</p> <p>The guilds built a handsome cathedral and an impressive set of city walls to ring-fence God's own people. The walls are one of the sacred symbols of Protestant inviolability, the \"Maiden city\" whose boundaries were never breached by Catholicism. But 300 years after the Protestant city saw off a Catholic siege, the Prods again find themselves under assault. The city is now about 75% Catholic, a fact which on Monday ensured the election of ex-IRA man Cathal Crumley as the city's mayor - the first republican to run any Irish city since partition in 1922.</p> <p>The old \"Derry side\" of the city has been all but abandoned by Protestants who fled during the Troubles to the east bank and the reassuring road to loyalist north Antrim. I went to school on the city side, to the only Protestant grammar, established when that side of town was a less alien environment. Northern Ireland's education system is still based around the 11-plus exam, when children feed into grammar or secondary schools, largely divided along class lines. The religious division happens much earlier, when you start primary school at the age of three or four. Both Catholic and Protestant schools are state funded, but the two are run along parallel - separate - systems.</p> <p>My old schoolmates were difficult to track down. I phoned five or six people; everyone's parents still lived where I remembered. \"I know that name well! How is your mum?\" But none of the kids was still in Derry. They were in Glasgow, or in Edinburgh, or \"across the water\" in England, the names of the remote cities pronounced as if they were foreign words. I tracked Andrea McDaid down to a telecom company in Belfast. She had moved back to Ulster after university in England, but hadn't been able to bring herself to come back up over the Sperrin mountains to Derry. She told me she had come up to the city for a work function, and had gone out with some colleagues on the city side of the river. It was the first time she had been out socialising on the west bank in her life.</p> <p>I had more luck with people I had known from church. John Thompson had also been to study across the water, but had come back to teach at the primary school 100 yards from where we both had gone to church as children, tucked into a labyrinthine Protestant estate with murals so menacing the Guardian's photographer refused to get out of the car. \"I wanted to come back because this was where I was from,\" Johnny says. \"But most people had gone, most of my friends had left Derry. They went to university in England or Scotland and got used to not having the hassle. They were sick of the things they had seen here, and in England it didn't matter who you were.\"</p> <p>He is in favour of the assembly, he says, and even welcomes Martin McGuinness's reinstatement to the post of education minister, the most contentious appointment of the new executive. \"You can only judge him on what he does, not on what he has done.\" Trimble has worked wonders, he thinks. \"If things hadn't gone well with that vote I might have thought we were going down the same road again. It was really important, because I don't think there would have been any way back if it hadn't gone well.\"</p> <p>This determined hope is something you see again and again among young Protestants, however much their political leaders may shout when placed in front of a microphone. Darren Graham has had one of the more remarkable conversions. He grew up on a big Protestant working class estate in Derry, where we went to church together, and where his mother still lives, but he doesn't go back to see her much. He got in with a bad crowd, got involved \"with drugs, with the paramilitaries, with buying drugs for the paramilitaries\". They would run round the estate causing trouble, lighting fires, intimidating people.</p> <p>\"I can't really go near the estate,\" he says now. \"I get the feeling that I'm regarded as a 'fenian lover' because I don't have that hatred that I thought I had. A lot of that stuff was generated by your peers, we all fed off each other.\" He is hopeful about Northern Ireland's fledgling parliament. \"The best thing about the agreement is that once we had two sides, and you had to belong to one of them, because if you sat on the fence you would get it from them both. Now we have got four - you have pro- and anti-agreement Catholics, pro- and anti-agreement Protestants. If they just keep on splitting us up more and more, that's how it's going to work.\"</p> <p>His friend William Docherty was disgusted with the vote to re-enter the Executive, however: \"And for the record I voted 'no' in the referendum. My dad didn't have to say anything. He knew I would vote no.\" Docherty is proud to assert the views of the stereotypical hot Prod, to the extent that his mates in the small sports club refer to him jokingly as \"the bigot\". But he denies he is bigoted. He just doesn't understand how anyone can have fallen for what he calls Sinn Fein's pro paganda. \"I just can't see how people can be sympathetic to them. The IRA hasn't given up a pound of Semtex. And then there's the prisoners. And what about the police? If we let out all the prisoners you are just having thugs run around with guns.\" The British, he says, are so desperate for peace they want to brush the real issues under the carpet and give the IRA anything they want.</p> <p>Docherty personifies many of the tensions that Protestantism is currently trying to keep in equilibrium. His parents, he says, would discourage him as much as possible from having Catholic friends. \"The way I'm brought up I'm just taught that even their religion is evil, that being a Catholic is wrong, and they worship idols. My dad thinks that if I run about with them I might be brainwashed.\" But then, he concedes, he has probably been brainwashed from birth anyway.</p> <p>And if this is bigotry, it's been watered down a lot since the rough boys at my school used to dig up the sports pitches to throw clods of mud at the black taxis, which we all knew were \"run by the IRA\". \"I do run about with a lot of Catholics and I have a few good enough mates,\" says Docherty. He even went out with a Catholic girl for a few months, though he never took her home. \"I told her why. My dad would have gone mad.\"</p> <p>It is only when I get home that I realise we haven't spoken at all about \"religion\", the thing that supposedly unites us. Docherty still goes to church, but often it is with a hangover. And this is what is responsible for Ulster's slow sea change, as much as political concessions or American intervention. For as long as the killing was going on, young Protestants and Catholics socialised in their own areas, and rarely met anyone from the other side. But drink, ecstasy and a creeping secularisation of society have brought them into contact with the other side in a way that even their parents, who grew up in more peaceful times, probably never experienced. The old suspicions remain, but young people in Northern Ireland are more interested now in getting drunk and getting laid than getting even.</p> <p>Across the river, in Derry's historic centre, the Bloody Sunday inquiry is sitting in the Guildhall, right in the middle of the main shopping promenade. It's a surreal and disturbing experience to sit in the public gallery and hear bored English lawyers intone details of grotesque and startling slaughter carried out by nonchalant British soldiers in 1972. A girl of about 14 sat on her own in the gallery, another man had brought his toddlers.</p> <p>I went for a walk on Derry's walls, the first time I have ever gone all the way round, since the army had closed off a section for most of the Troubles. It was a muggy afternoon, and the children going home from school had slung their school blazers over their shoulders as they took the 300-year-old shortcut home.

      "bodyText": "The first time I was sure that I was about to die was when I heard the Catholics coming for us from the other side of the river. It wasn't unusual to hear the occasional gunshot from the Bogside or the Creggan, the two big Catholic estates on the \"city side\" of Derry. We were used to things going bang in the night, the odd dull thud of a bomb or a crackle of gunshots echoing across the river Foyle to the nice middle-class Protestant area where my family lived. But this was different. The sounds of imminent massacre were unmistakable, weapons being fired in the air in gleeful bloodlust. I clung to my bunk bed, sick with terror. It was only when I finally scrambled downstairs to my mother's cool, comforting laughter that I realised I had been listening to a firework display. Childhood terrors were of a different scale when you grew up in Derry in the late 70s. As well as bogeymen and bed bugs, we had the Catholics to keep us awake at night. No one really lived their life in a state of permanent fear, apart from those whose dads were in the police (and we all knew who they were). But even as I approached my teens, there was a feeling that the only way the \"Troubles\" could be resolved would be through one side slaughtering the other. Everyone knew the Catholics were going to outbreed us at some point, but the British, we trusted, would never let Northern Ireland go back to the Irish. The IRA would be forced to massacre us in our beds. Thirteen years after I left Derry at the age of 14, I am bewildered by the opinions I held as a child. My parents, good Protestant folk who were as liberal as it was possible to be in those times, had raised us without the smallest trace of animosity towards the Catholic people who shared the city with us. But despite their best efforts, we were inevitably infected by sectarianism. It was part of the air you breathed in Ulster, it hung in the soft, drizzly rain. Casual slaughter was part of the routine rhythm of life, after all: even today many of my childhood memories are bound up with atrocities. I went to Omagh the day that Lord Mountbatten was blown up. A friend's mother died the day two soldiers were battered to death at a Belfast funeral. I had my last cello lesson the day a loyalist gunman killed three at another funeral. It is this mad little world that observers have to try to enter if they want to understand Northern Ireland's tentative progress towards peace. How, I wondered, had the Ulster Unionist party's narrow vote to re-enter Northern Ireland's executive government played in Nelson Drive and in Lincoln Courts and in Irish Street? What would my friend Andrea McDaid, who had talked with me late into the night about the coming massacre, make of it? What about the girls who taught me songs about burning the Pope in the back of the minibus on the way to hockey matches? I wanted to go back to Derry, to talk to the people I had grown up with and who, unlike me, had stayed. I had moved to a school in Belfast, decided I was really a nationalist, and taken off to university in England, looking over my shoulder with the mix of romanticism, guilt and disgust that characterises Irish exiles the world over. It was a philosophical conversion rather than one based on any experience - I made my first real Catholic friend at university in England. But as the ties of fearful religion loosened, I realised that identifying with Ireland rather than Ulster had its own attractions. The devil did have the best tunes after all. But what about those who stayed? If Northern Ireland is a weird little place, Derry must be one of its weirdest corners. Tucked up in the north-west corner of the province, right on the border with the Irish republic, it is the second biggest city in Ulster, but still fits neatly into a chest-tighteningly beautiful lough valley under the soft hills of Donegal. The ancient Irish town of Doire became Londonderry in the early 17th century, when several wealthy London trades guilds invested heavily in the new Protestant citadel. (The fraught issue of how to refer to the city still exercises the minds of the country's brightest and best. This paper's style is to call it \"Londonderry\", Protestants all over Northern Ireland insist on nothing less, but almost everyone in the city, from both sides, refers to it as \"Derry\".) The guilds built a handsome cathedral and an impressive set of city walls to ring-fence God's own people. The walls are one of the sacred symbols of Protestant inviolability, the \"Maiden city\" whose boundaries were never breached by Catholicism. But 300 years after the Protestant city saw off a Catholic siege, the Prods again find themselves under assault. The city is now about 75% Catholic, a fact which on Monday ensured the election of ex-IRA man Cathal Crumley as the city's mayor - the first republican to run any Irish city since partition in 1922. The old \"Derry side\" of the city has been all but abandoned by Protestants who fled during the Troubles to the east bank and the reassuring road to loyalist north Antrim. I went to school on the city side, to the only Protestant grammar, established when that side of town was a less alien environment. Northern Ireland's education system is still based around the 11-plus exam, when children feed into grammar or secondary schools, largely divided along class lines. The religious division happens much earlier, when you start primary school at the age of three or four. Both Catholic and Protestant schools are state funded, but the two are run along parallel - separate - systems. My old schoolmates were difficult to track down. I phoned five or six people; everyone's parents still lived where I remembered. \"I know that name well! How is your mum?\" But none of the kids was still in Derry. They were in Glasgow, or in Edinburgh, or \"across the water\" in England, the names of the remote cities pronounced as if they were foreign words. I tracked Andrea McDaid down to a telecom company in Belfast. She had moved back to Ulster after university in England, but hadn't been able to bring herself to come back up over the Sperrin mountains to Derry. She told me she had come up to the city for a work function, and had gone out with some colleagues on the city side of the river. It was the first time she had been out socialising on the west bank in her life. I had more luck with people I had known from church. John Thompson had also been to study across the water, but had come back to teach at the primary school 100 yards from where we both had gone to church as children, tucked into a labyrinthine Protestant estate with murals so menacing the Guardian's photographer refused to get out of the car. \"I wanted to come back because this was where I was from,\" Johnny says. \"But most people had gone, most of my friends had left Derry. They went to university in England or Scotland and got used to not having the hassle. They were sick of the things they had seen here, and in England it didn't matter who you were.\" He is in favour of the assembly, he says, and even welcomes Martin McGuinness's reinstatement to the post of education minister, the most contentious appointment of the new executive. \"You can only judge him on what he does, not on what he has done.\" Trimble has worked wonders, he thinks. \"If things hadn't gone well with that vote I might have thought we were going down the same road again. It was really important, because I don't think there would have been any way back if it hadn't gone well.\" This determined hope is something you see again and again among young Protestants, however much their political leaders may shout when placed in front of a microphone. Darren Graham has had one of the more remarkable conversions. He grew up on a big Protestant working class estate in Derry, where we went to church together, and where his mother still lives, but he doesn't go back to see her much. He got in with a bad crowd, got involved \"with drugs, with the paramilitaries, with buying drugs for the paramilitaries\". They would run round the estate causing trouble, lighting fires, intimidating people. \"I can't really go near the estate,\" he says now. \"I get the feeling that I'm regarded as a 'fenian lover' because I don't have that hatred that I thought I had. A lot of that stuff was generated by your peers, we all fed off each other.\" He is hopeful about Northern Ireland's fledgling parliament. \"The best thing about the agreement is that once we had two sides, and you had to belong to one of them, because if you sat on the fence you would get it from them both. Now we have got four - you have pro- and anti-agreement Catholics, pro- and anti-agreement Protestants. If they just keep on splitting us up more and more, that's how it's going to work.\" His friend William Docherty was disgusted with the vote to re-enter the Executive, however: \"And for the record I voted 'no' in the referendum. My dad didn't have to say anything. He knew I would vote no.\" Docherty is proud to assert the views of the stereotypical hot Prod, to the extent that his mates in the small sports club refer to him jokingly as \"the bigot\". But he denies he is bigoted. He just doesn't understand how anyone can have fallen for what he calls Sinn Fein's pro paganda. \"I just can't see how people can be sympathetic to them. The IRA hasn't given up a pound of Semtex. And then there's the prisoners. And what about the police? If we let out all the prisoners you are just having thugs run around with guns.\" The British, he says, are so desperate for peace they want to brush the real issues under the carpet and give the IRA anything they want. Docherty personifies many of the tensions that Protestantism is currently trying to keep in equilibrium. His parents, he says, would discourage him as much as possible from having Catholic friends. \"The way I'm brought up I'm just taught that even their religion is evil, that being a Catholic is wrong, and they worship idols. My dad thinks that if I run about with them I might be brainwashed.\" But then, he concedes, he has probably been brainwashed from birth anyway. And if this is bigotry, it's been watered down a lot since the rough boys at my school used to dig up the sports pitches to throw clods of mud at the black taxis, which we all knew were \"run by the IRA\". \"I do run about with a lot of Catholics and I have a few good enough mates,\" says Docherty. He even went out with a Catholic girl for a few months, though he never took her home. \"I told her why. My dad would have gone mad.\" It is only when I get home that I realise we haven't spoken at all about \"religion\", the thing that supposedly unites us. Docherty still goes to church, but often it is with a hangover. And this is what is responsible for Ulster's slow sea change, as much as political concessions or American intervention. For as long as the killing was going on, young Protestants and Catholics socialised in their own areas, and rarely met anyone from the other side. But drink, ecstasy and a creeping secularisation of society have brought them into contact with the other side in a way that even their parents, who grew up in more peaceful times, probably never experienced. The old suspicions remain, but young people in Northern Ireland are more interested now in getting drunk and getting laid than getting even. Across the river, in Derry's historic centre, the Bloody Sunday inquiry is sitting in the Guildhall, right in the middle of the main shopping promenade. It's a surreal and disturbing experience to sit in the public gallery and hear bored English lawyers intone details of grotesque and startling slaughter carried out by nonchalant British soldiers in 1972. A girl of about 14 sat on her own in the gallery, another man had brought his toddlers. I went for a walk on Derry's walls, the first time I have ever gone all the way round, since the army had closed off a section for most of the Troubles. It was a muggy afternoon, and the children going home from school had slung their school blazers over their shoulders as they took the 300-year-old shortcut home. Perched on a battlement overlooking the river, a couple of teenagers snogged as if their futures depended on it. Her uniform was that of my Protestant school, his of the new Catholic college in the city. A small but significant image of hope for the new Derry. Some of the names have been changed",

Next week's talks will try to narrow the gaps between the Israelis and Palestinians sufficiently so that President Clinton can preside over a three-way summit. If all goes according to an immensely ambitious plan, that summit would produce a final agreement before September 13. With that aim, Ms Albright announced in the West Bank city of Ramallah that the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, will travel to Washington to meet the US president a week from today. Mr Clinton is expected to amplify the message that Ms Albright has been trying to get across during her visit to Israel and the West Bank: that both sides will have to make deep concessions on such emotional issues as the final status of the holy city of Jerusalem and the right of return for Palestinian refugees. \"I think as we go through all these negotiations, it is evident that it is impossible for both sides to get 100% of what each side wants,\" she said yesterday. \"But they will not succeed unless both are satisfied with what they have got.\" However, Mr Arafat and the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, have been losing room for compromise.

People are worried about genetically modified organisms getting into the environment. What people forget is that the introduction of exotic species - like, for instance, the introduction of the grey squirrel into this country - is going to, or has done, far more damage than a genetically modified piece of potato. The real point is, where are the limits to what we do?\" </p> <p>Princess Anne had declared it was an \"oversimplification\" to say that there should be no GM foods. \"Man has been tinkering with food production and plant development for such a long time that it is a bit cheeky to suddenly get nervous about it.\" </p> <p>Last month Prince Charles, in a BBC Reith lecture, had warned against creating conditions in which \"genetic manipulation seeks to transform the process of biological evolution into something altogether different\". </p> <p>Supporters of all three royals were last night stressing their credentials for the right to voice their opinions. They have all been involved in environmental issues to a lesser or greater extent. Prince Philip was a past president of the World Wide Fund for Nature and has a strong interest on conservation issues. Princess Anne is president of Save the Children, and she has seen conventional crop failures in developing countries. This year she is president of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Prince Charles has long been a standard bearer for organic farming methods and a champion of less intensive agriculture. All three were keen \"hands-on\" farmers at their estates, Balmoral and Sandringham, Gatcombe Park, and Highgrove. </p> <p>Prince Philip's comments were welcomed by pro-GM scientists. Jim Dunwell, a professor at Reading university, said: \"It is useful that everybody is getting involved in the debate. Just because they are members of the best known family does not mean they should not have a view.\" </p> <p>The Cabinet Office, which is masterminding the government's GM policy, said that Prince Philip's remarks were \"an interesting contribution to the debate\". The food standards agency will be looking at the GM food debate during its next public board meeting in Glasgow on June 22. </p> <p>Tim Yeo, the Conservatives' agriculture spokesman, while not wanting \"to get involved in a family row\", suggested that Prince Philip was \"slightly confused about this issue\". </p> <p>He added: \"Of course, it is right that the introduction of some exotic animals into an island like Britain has done great damage, but that should make him more cautious, not less cautious, about the consequences of genetic modification. Genetic modification goes much further than selec tive plant breeding or gradually improving horses so they can run faster. </p> <p>\"It does involve taking genes from one species such as a fish which is normally confined to the Arctic and sticking it into something like a tomato to make [that plant] more frost resistant.\" </p> <p>A similar criticism was made by Friends of the Earth, although Pete Riley, the campaigns spokesman, said: \"I bet there are plenty of arguments going on around the country's dinner tables. It would be entertaining to eavesdrop on the next royal family dinner. We've been calling for a public debate on this for the past three years, perhaps at last we are going to get it.\" </p> <p><strong>Useful links</strong><br> <a href=\"http://news2.thls.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/events/reith_2000/lecture6.stm\" targets=\"_new\">The Prince of Wales: Reith Lecture</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.royal.gov.uk/\" targets=\"_new\">The British Monarchy</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/\" targets=\"_new\">The Prince of Wales' site</a></p>",

But suggestions of a rift over GM issues or family criticism of Prince Charles were strongly denied by sources last night and Buckingham Palace insisted the \"different emphases and opinions\" within the royal family merely \"reflect the diverse opinions of people generally across the board\". Prince Philip was responding to a lecture by Jonathan Sacks, the chief rabbi, which touched on GM crops while discussing the wider issues of genetics. Prince Philip said: \"Do not let us forget that we have been genetically modifying animals and plants ever since people started selective breeding. People are worried about genetically modified organisms getting into the environment. What people forget is that the introduction of exotic species - like, for instance, the introduction of the grey squirrel into this country - is going to, or has done, far more damage than a genetically modified piece of potato. The real point is, where are the limits to what we do?\" Princess Anne had declared it was an \"oversimplification\" to say that there should be no GM foods. \"Man has been tinkering with food production and plant development for such a long time that it is a bit cheeky to suddenly get nervous about it.\" Last month Prince Charles, in a BBC Reith lecture, had warned against creating conditions in which \"genetic manipulation seeks to transform the process of biological evolution into something altogether different\". Supporters of all three royals were last night stressing their credentials for the right to voice their opinions. They have all been involved in environmental issues to a lesser or greater extent. Prince Philip was a past president of the World Wide Fund for Nature and has a strong interest on conservation issues. Princess Anne is president of Save the Children, and she has seen conventional crop failures in developing countries. This year she is president of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. Meanwhile, Prince Charles has long been a standard bearer for organic farming methods and a champion of less intensive agriculture. All three were keen \"hands-on\" farmers at their estates, Balmoral and Sandringham, Gatcombe Park, and Highgrove. Prince Philip's comments were welcomed by pro-GM scientists. Jim Dunwell, a professor at Reading university, said: \"It is useful that everybody is getting involved in the debate. Just because they are members of the best known family does not mean they should not have a view.\" The Cabinet Office, which is masterminding the government's GM policy, said that Prince Philip's remarks were \"an interesting contribution to the debate\". The food standards agency will be looking at the GM food debate during its next public board meeting in Glasgow on June 22. Tim Yeo, the Conservatives' agriculture spokesman, while not wanting \"to get involved in a family row\", suggested that Prince Philip was \"slightly confused about this issue\". He added: \"Of course, it is right that the introduction of some exotic animals into an island like Britain has done great damage, but that should make him more cautious, not less cautious, about the consequences of genetic modification. Genetic modification goes much further than selec tive plant breeding or gradually improving horses so they can run faster. \"It does involve taking genes from one species such as a fish which is normally confined to the Arctic and sticking it into something like a tomato to make [that plant] more frost resistant.\" A similar criticism was made by Friends of the Earth, although Pete Riley, the campaigns spokesman, said: \"I bet there are plenty of arguments going on around the country's dinner tables. It would be entertaining to eavesdrop on the next royal family dinner. We've been calling for a public debate on this for the past three years, perhaps at last we are going to get it.\" Useful links The Prince of Wales: Reith Lecture The British Monarchy The Prince of Wales' site",

But yesterday the company showed there is cash to be made from this worthy business: especially on special occasions such as the millennium. Strong first-half figures triggered a 5% revival in Securicor's stock price. Until now the only thing that had titillated investors since the new year was takeover speculation and that died out in early April.

The ambitious proposal was announced in the Commons by Robin Cook, who also told MPs that most British troops will leave Sierra Leone next week after achieving the short-term aim of securing Lungi airport to allow a build-up of UN peacekeepers. The foreign secretary, who is to have talks with President Ahmed Kabbah in Freetown tomorow, wants a UN resolution banning the trade in diamonds from Sierre Leone \"except where they are certified as legitimate by the government\". Foreign Office officials conceded yesterday that an embargo on smuggled diamonds would be difficult to police and require the voluntary cooperation of bankers, brokers and buyers in the world's three main diamond centres -Antwerp, Tel Aviv, and Bombay - as well as de Beers, which manages the world's biggest market for rough diamonds from London. It will also require the cooperation of Charles Taylor, the president of Liberia, who has been supplying arms to Sierra Leone's rebel Revolutionary United Front in return for diamonds. The United States has been pressing Mr Taylor to stop the trade without success. Of an estimated $70m worth of diamonds exported from Sierra Leone last year, just $1.5m were \"legitimate\", according to industry sources. One proposal, FO officials said yesterday, was for the Sierra Leone government to seal official diamond exports in forge-proof sealed packages. They took comfort from a similar scheme in Angola, where diamonds have funded Unita rebels. In Sierra Leone, the rebel RUF still controls the diamond mines in the east of the country neighbouring Liberia. The objective, Mr Cook said yesterday, was to bring the diamond area under the control of government and UN troops. \"Diamonds have fuelled this war. And the people of Sierra Leone remains among the world's poorest while the wealth of its diamonds goes to rebels\", Mr Cook added. The foreign secretary described a \"much improved\" security situation in Sierra Leone with all 500 UN personnel seized by the rebels released and the RUF leader, Foday Sankoh, in custody. He shed no light on the whereabouts of the British UN adviser Major Andrew Harrison and the aid worker Alan Smith. Mr Cook said 600 Royal Marines would leave Sierra Leone next week.

      "trailText": "The new independent food standards agency will have to resist pressure from politicians if it is to satisfy consumers' demands",
      "byline": "James Meikle",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The public is cynical about the pursuit of profits by the food industry and has a low opinion of the competence and openness of politicians over food. So says research commissioned by the new independent food standards agency.</p> <p>This is only to be expected after a string of crises - listeria in cheese, salmonella in eggs, BSE and now genetic modification - in which the government has failed to give any impression of management or regulatory supervision. After all, distrust of the UK agriculture ministries, especially the English one, lay behind Tony Blair's decision to create the new agency in the first place.</p> <p>Yet the same research shows that people do have confidence in food they eat. They trust the supermarkets more than small shopkeepers, discount stores or markets. The public perception is that people do not generally fall ill and that the regulatory system works.</p> <p>At the same time, the research, by Cragg Ross Dawson, reveals concerns about the factory farm conditions in which poultry are raised, the content of animal feed for other livestock and the effect of pesticides and chemicals on fruit and vegetables. \"The big retailers and established brands are widely trusted, yet people feel many of their anxieties are a consequence of the industrialisation of farming and commercialisation of food distribution.\"</p> <p>In other words, the messages are mixed. This ambiguity would be challenge enough for the agency, which has now been in existence for two months. More worrying is the evidence from group discussions just weeks before it began of widespread suspicion about how it will work. \"The success of the agency will be judged by many on the impossibly challenging criterion of how many food scares have been averted.\"</p> <p>The new agency has been busy. It announced compulsory licensing of butchers, launched a review of labelling standards and declared its readiness to \"name and shame\" companies which fail to meet those standards. Its board meetings are being held in public, and there are numerous forums planned where the public's worries can be aired. Its chairman, Sir John Krebs, and deputy chairwoman, Suzi Leather, are travelling the country to demonstrate their openness.</p> <p>Would such energy had been shown when it emerged that farmers had unwittingly planted conventional rapeseed contaminated with GM material. The Cabinet Office, responsible for GM policy and presentation, quickly fled the scene, leaving the flak to be taken once more by the poor old Ministry of Agriculture (MAFF), although the Department of the Environment and the Environment Agency have not been above criticism here.</p> <p>The food safety agency found out about the mistake weeks after MAFF was informed by the company involved and quickly cleared the crop. It behaved like any old government advisory body. Sir John did warn that consumers needed to have confidence in products described as coming from GM-free sources. But as head of an independent body he ought to have gone in far harder for the poor consumer. One hopes that behind the scenes he was a lot more cross. In future he will need to be more \"political\" with politicians who will blame future failures of food policy on his agency.</p> <p>It faces other tests, not least the food industry's reaction to its wish for new codes on television advertising of junk food and on labelling - claims such as \"country-style\" or \"fat-free\". The government wants less red tape, more self-policing; Sir John and colleagues do not think such arrangements have been totally successful.</p> <p>How statistics are used and risks managed are among the agency's other tough assignments. Food poisoning figures, for instance, are notoriously unreliable - we cannot be sure how real is the reported increase. Salmonella infections, now apparently under control thanks to improvements in poultry rearing, may be more than twice as prevalent as reported. And campylobacter, a more worrying problem, may be nearly eight times worse than reported figures show. Food poisoning is officially \"any disease of an infectious or toxic nature caused by or thought to be caused by consumption of food or water\", an incredibly wide definition that could include cases of the human form of BSE.</p> <p>A row similar to that over beef on the bone may soon erupt over E coli 0157, the vicious bug that can kill children, elderly people and those with weak immune systems. Scientists are worried at the number of outbreaks connected with land recently used for pasturing animals. Some have even suggested bans on rock concerts, fairs, markets, picnics or scout camps on such land, which can harbour the bug for months. Should young children be stopped from going on farm visits? Though often food-borne, E coli may spread without food being involved at all. A hand that touched animals, their dung or even simply soil might be enough. Should the food agency get involved? Perhaps public health warnings by event organisers and more washing facilities (imposing a cost that could scupper events anyway) will be enough.</p> <p>The agency's success depends on how it resolves such issues. As Suzi Leather put it last week: \"We have to get across the message that science progresses through disagreement. If no one challenges anything, we don't move forward. We have to be prepared to say 'We don't know'.\"</p> <p>James Meikle is our agriculture correspondent. <a href=\"mailto:james.meikle@theguardian.com\">james.meikle@theguardian.com</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "The public is cynical about the pursuit of profits by the food industry and has a low opinion of the competence and openness of politicians over food. So says research commissioned by the new independent food standards agency. This is only to be expected after a string of crises - listeria in cheese, salmonella in eggs, BSE and now genetic modification - in which the government has failed to give any impression of management or regulatory supervision. After all, distrust of the UK agriculture ministries, especially the English one, lay behind Tony Blair's decision to create the new agency in the first place. Yet the same research shows that people do have confidence in food they eat. They trust the supermarkets more than small shopkeepers, discount stores or markets. The public perception is that people do not generally fall ill and that the regulatory system works. At the same time, the research, by Cragg Ross Dawson, reveals concerns about the factory farm conditions in which poultry are raised, the content of animal feed for other livestock and the effect of pesticides and chemicals on fruit and vegetables. \"The big retailers and established brands are widely trusted, yet people feel many of their anxieties are a consequence of the industrialisation of farming and commercialisation of food distribution.\" In other words, the messages are mixed. This ambiguity would be challenge enough for the agency, which has now been in existence for two months. More worrying is the evidence from group discussions just weeks before it began of widespread suspicion about how it will work. \"The success of the agency will be judged by many on the impossibly challenging criterion of how many food scares have been averted.\" The new agency has been busy. It announced compulsory licensing of butchers, launched a review of labelling standards and declared its readiness to \"name and shame\" companies which fail to meet those standards. Its board meetings are being held in public, and there are numerous forums planned where the public's worries can be aired. Its chairman, Sir John Krebs, and deputy chairwoman, Suzi Leather, are travelling the country to demonstrate their openness. Would such energy had been shown when it emerged that farmers had unwittingly planted conventional rapeseed contaminated with GM material. The Cabinet Office, responsible for GM policy and presentation, quickly fled the scene, leaving the flak to be taken once more by the poor old Ministry of Agriculture (MAFF), although the Department of the Environment and the Environment Agency have not been above criticism here. The food safety agency found out about the mistake weeks after MAFF was informed by the company involved and quickly cleared the crop. It behaved like any old government advisory body. Sir John did warn that consumers needed to have confidence in products described as coming from GM-free sources. But as head of an independent body he ought to have gone in far harder for the poor consumer. One hopes that behind the scenes he was a lot more cross. In future he will need to be more \"political\" with politicians who will blame future failures of food policy on his agency. It faces other tests, not least the food industry's reaction to its wish for new codes on television advertising of junk food and on labelling - claims such as \"country-style\" or \"fat-free\". The government wants less red tape, more self-policing; Sir John and colleagues do not think such arrangements have been totally successful. How statistics are used and risks managed are among the agency's other tough assignments. Food poisoning figures, for instance, are notoriously unreliable - we cannot be sure how real is the reported increase. Salmonella infections, now apparently under control thanks to improvements in poultry rearing, may be more than twice as prevalent as reported. And campylobacter, a more worrying problem, may be nearly eight times worse than reported figures show. Food poisoning is officially \"any disease of an infectious or toxic nature caused by or thought to be caused by consumption of food or water\", an incredibly wide definition that could include cases of the human form of BSE. A row similar to that over beef on the bone may soon erupt over E coli 0157, the vicious bug that can kill children, elderly people and those with weak immune systems. Scientists are worried at the number of outbreaks connected with land recently used for pasturing animals. Some have even suggested bans on rock concerts, fairs, markets, picnics or scout camps on such land, which can harbour the bug for months. Should young children be stopped from going on farm visits? Though often food-borne, E coli may spread without food being involved at all. A hand that touched animals, their dung or even simply soil might be enough. Should the food agency get involved? Perhaps public health warnings by event organisers and more washing facilities (imposing a cost that could scupper events anyway) will be enough. The agency's success depends on how it resolves such issues. As Suzi Leather put it last week: \"We have to get across the message that science progresses through disagreement. If no one challenges anything, we don't move forward. We have to be prepared to say 'We don't know'.\" James Meikle is our agriculture correspondent. james.meikle@theguardian.com",

But the surprising answer insiders are coming up with is that it could and should be done. Most important of all, and what makes it a Third Way answer, is that it could be done without declaring war on the doctors. It could gain the overwhelming support of most consultants - at a cost. </p> <p>Here's the plan. Only 6,000 out of the 21,000 NHS consultants have any private practice at all, or any prospect of any. Many of those 6,000 have only a little private work on the side: a smallish handful of big players do a vast quantity. The radical idea is to offer a large salary increase - somewhere between \u00a320,000 and \u00a330,000 - to buy consultants out of their private practice altogether. The argument inside the department is between some parsimonious officials who think the money could be paid just to surgeons and anaesthetists (98% of surgeons have some private practice).

Bevan complained about having to stuff their mouths with gold. But by present day standards NHS consultants are not highly paid. The maximum basic salary for an NHS consultant is \u00a363,000, not a fortune considering how hard most work and 10 years of gruelling training. (If the national plan does all it promises, many will be working a lot harder, too.)

In his manifesto, the mayor of London took a strong line against access to GLA staff or assembly members for the kind of lobbyist widely blamed for bringing Parliament into disrepute during the \"cash for questions\" controversies of the Tory years. But in a letter to the lobbyists' organisations, Lord Neill, chairman of the independent committee on standards in public life, concedes that it would be wrong to exclude lobbyists when other bodies - including charities and single issue pressure groups - retain access to elected members. \"It is very difficult to define a lobbyist in exact terms and the rules governing contacts between those in government and outside bodies should be framed accordingly to avoid unfairness,\" Lord Neill wrote. Mr Livingstone, who is putting together his team and policies during a two-month transition before full powers are granted him on July 3, has called for the GLA to be \"open and transparent\" - a policy since endorsed by the two lobbyist groups, the Association of Professional Political Consultants (APPC) and the Public Relations Consultants Association (PRCA). In their letter to Mr Living stone before the election the two groups' chairmen, Michael Burrell of the APPC and the PRCA's Simon Nayyer, say they are \"deeply troubled by your suggestion that lobbyists should not be allowed to meet GLA staff\". But they do agree with the London mayor's insistence that lobbyists should not be granted passes which would give them access to the authority's HQ - currently in Romey House, Westminster - as happens when MPs sometimes give researchers passes to pressure group and other campaign staffers. \"We seek no special privileges for our members,\" say the lobbyists whose members are already forbidden - by mutual agreement - from having access to the Welsh assembly and Scottish parliament other than what is granted to members of the public and other campaigners. Last night a spokesman for the mayor said that Mr Livingstone has been quizzed on the issue at his first public question time last month. He replied that he remains \"opposed to meeting commercial lobbyists\" but said he may adopt the Commons code on the issue. That code controls what MPs can do for lobbyists and other outside interests.

He said that he did not think it was necessary for these representations to be heard in public.</p> <p>But the lord chief justice did say, for the first time, that he would announce the decision, which is expected within the next two months, and his reasons for it, in public and in open court.</p> <p>He is expected to follow the same procedure as he considers the backlog of 140 other juvenile cases whose sentences are also to be reviewed as a result of the Strasbourg court ruling last December that it was wrong for a politician to be involved in deciding how long they should serve.</p> <p>Lord Woolf said that one of his main concerns as lord chief justice would be to increase public confidence in the judiciary and said he hoped that when judges took \"unpopular decisions\" he thought it very important they should fully explain why they had done so in terms that both the media and the public would be able to understand.</p>",

He said that it was likely that a test case would be brought after the European convention on human rights was incorporated into British law in October which would challenge the right of the home secretary to set the sentences of all 3,400 mandatory life prisoners, including the 26 who have been told that in their cases \"life must mean life\". \"I do think that it is inevitable that the task in relation to mandatory life sen tences is going to be transferred to the judiciary,\" said Lord Woolf. \"That approach is dictated by the standards expected under the European convention.\" The role of the home secretary in setting the term that the Bulger killers must serve has already been declared illegal under the European convention by the Strasbourg court as has his role in setting the sentences of discretionary lifers and Lord Woolf anticipated yesterday that a similar decision is likely in the case of \"mandatory lifers\". It would mean that the judges might be asked to reconsider the sentences in all cases where the home secretary set a different tariff than that recommended by the lord chief justice. Lord Woolf made clear that it would be for the court to decide \"on a question of law\" at that point whether it was wrong for the home secretary to be involved in such decisions but while his answer was not \"on the legal question\", it was his view about what was generally likely to happen. Lord Woolf also went on to raise the hopes of Britain's most notorious killers, including Myra Hindley and Rose West, when he outlined his personal reservations about the use of \"life must mean life\" sentences imposed for the first time by Michael Howard and then Jack Straw which meant that such prisoners will never be released. Lord Woolf, who has a reputation as a liberal reformer, said that the range of murders committed was extraordinarily wide. \"I have reservations about saying, in advance without being given a particular case, that any case is so lacking in aspects of redemption that one can anticipate that throughout the natural life of the individual concerned it will never, ever be proper to release them. \"I do not think that anybody should take the view that at the minimum they will never, ever be released because so many things can happen that you cannot anticipate,\" he said. Lord Woolf also confirmed that the family of the murdered child, James Bulger, would be consulted before he took the decision on how much longer his killers, Robert Thompson and Jon Venables, should serve before they were released. He said that the director of public prosecutions would report to him on the views of James Bulger's parents and responses on behalf of Thompson and Venables would also be taken before he makes a final decision. He said that he did not think it was necessary for these representations to be heard in public. But the lord chief justice did say, for the first time, that he would announce the decision, which is expected within the next two months, and his reasons for it, in public and in open court. He is expected to follow the same procedure as he considers the backlog of 140 other juvenile cases whose sentences are also to be reviewed as a result of the Strasbourg court ruling last December that it was wrong for a politician to be involved in deciding how long they should serve. Lord Woolf said that one of his main concerns as lord chief justice would be to increase public confidence in the judiciary and said he hoped that when judges took \"unpopular decisions\" he thought it very important they should fully explain why they had done so in terms that both the media and the public would be able to understand.",

      "body": "<p>With less than three weeks to Zimbabwe's crucial parliamentary elections, the British government launched an unprecedented attack on President Robert Mugabe, charging that he is determined to hold unfair elections and to ruin the country's economy.</p> <p>\"Neither Britain nor the international community can make this election fair. Only Robert Mugabe can do that, and he seems determined not to,\" the Foreign Office minister, Peter Hain, said. \"Neither Britain nor the international community can solve the land problem or reverse Zimbabwe's economic decline. Only Robert Mugabe can do so, and he shows no sign of wanting to.\"</p> <p>Mr Hain's criticism was contained in a faxed statement released by the British high commission in Harare yesterday. It came as international observers arrived to monitor the elections, including an estimated 200 from the EU. Others came from the Commonwealth.</p> <p>In the run-up to the elections on June 24-25, Mr Mugabe's Zanu-PF party has unleashed a widespread campaign of violence against the opposition that has taken 30 lives. Thousands more opposition supporters have been beaten, raped and tortured.</p> <p>In the latest reported incident, ruling party militants attacked teachers and health workers, forcing many to flee their clinics and schools, an independent monitoring group and Zimbabwe's main opposition party said yesterday.</p> <p>Many of those injured in the violence last month in northeast Zimbabwe were also barred from entering medical clinics, the Community Working Group on Health said.</p> <p>Mr Mugabe's relations with Mr Hain have been strained ever since his outspoken criticism in March, when customs officials in Harare opened and inspected the contents of several British diplomatic bags. At the time, Mr Hain described the move as \"not the action of a civilised country,\" remarks that many in Zimbabwe found deeply offensive. Mr Mugabe has since launched numerous outspoken attacks on Tony Blair's government.</p> <p>The president refused to allow Britons to participate in the EU and Commonwealth observer teams. The British government decided it was more important to get international observers on the ground than insist on its right to participate. In any case, Britons are in the senior ad ministration of both the EU and Commonwealth teams.</p> <p>\"We are not going to pre-empt the observers' verdict or the verdict of the people of Zimbabwe. To pre-empt would be to play Robert Mugabe's game,\" Mr Hain said. \"He wants to run this election with Britain as the opposition and we are not going to oblige.</p> <p>\"We are in close contact with partners from the Commonwealth, European commission and the United Nations. We have expressed our concerns and we will be monitoring closely reports from the election observers,\" he added.</p> <p>Mr Mugabe's Zanu-PF party is facing its strongest challenge since coming to power 20 years ago. The new Movement for Democratic Change has fielded candidates in all 120 constituencies, the first time an opposition party has done so since 1980.</p> <p>In the rural areas, where 65% of the people live, Zanu-PF officials have told peasants that their vote will not be secret, and that they will be killed if they vote for the MDC. Many of the subsistence farmers believe the threats and are afraid to vote for the opposition. An international presence in the rural areas is badly needed. A countrywide voter education campaign is also needed to counteract the misinformation, but neither the EU nor the Commonwealth appear prepared to participate in such a move.</p> <p>Despite the brutality and propaganda, events are not favouring Mr Mugabe. The country's six month-old fuel shortage noticeably worsened this week, with queues of hundreds of cars, taxis, trucks and tractors stretching throughout Harare and the rest of the country. Police had to use teargas to restore order at besieged service stations. Thousands of township households are also affected because the country has run out of paraffin, the main fuel for cooking.

      "bodyText": "With less than three weeks to Zimbabwe's crucial parliamentary elections, the British government launched an unprecedented attack on President Robert Mugabe, charging that he is determined to hold unfair elections and to ruin the country's economy. \"Neither Britain nor the international community can make this election fair. Only Robert Mugabe can do that, and he seems determined not to,\" the Foreign Office minister, Peter Hain, said. \"Neither Britain nor the international community can solve the land problem or reverse Zimbabwe's economic decline. Only Robert Mugabe can do so, and he shows no sign of wanting to.\" Mr Hain's criticism was contained in a faxed statement released by the British high commission in Harare yesterday. It came as international observers arrived to monitor the elections, including an estimated 200 from the EU. Others came from the Commonwealth. In the run-up to the elections on June 24-25, Mr Mugabe's Zanu-PF party has unleashed a widespread campaign of violence against the opposition that has taken 30 lives. Thousands more opposition supporters have been beaten, raped and tortured. In the latest reported incident, ruling party militants attacked teachers and health workers, forcing many to flee their clinics and schools, an independent monitoring group and Zimbabwe's main opposition party said yesterday. Many of those injured in the violence last month in northeast Zimbabwe were also barred from entering medical clinics, the Community Working Group on Health said. Mr Mugabe's relations with Mr Hain have been strained ever since his outspoken criticism in March, when customs officials in Harare opened and inspected the contents of several British diplomatic bags. At the time, Mr Hain described the move as \"not the action of a civilised country,\" remarks that many in Zimbabwe found deeply offensive. Mr Mugabe has since launched numerous outspoken attacks on Tony Blair's government. The president refused to allow Britons to participate in the EU and Commonwealth observer teams. The British government decided it was more important to get international observers on the ground than insist on its right to participate. In any case, Britons are in the senior ad ministration of both the EU and Commonwealth teams. \"We are not going to pre-empt the observers' verdict or the verdict of the people of Zimbabwe. To pre-empt would be to play Robert Mugabe's game,\" Mr Hain said. \"He wants to run this election with Britain as the opposition and we are not going to oblige. \"We are in close contact with partners from the Commonwealth, European commission and the United Nations. We have expressed our concerns and we will be monitoring closely reports from the election observers,\" he added. Mr Mugabe's Zanu-PF party is facing its strongest challenge since coming to power 20 years ago. The new Movement for Democratic Change has fielded candidates in all 120 constituencies, the first time an opposition party has done so since 1980. In the rural areas, where 65% of the people live, Zanu-PF officials have told peasants that their vote will not be secret, and that they will be killed if they vote for the MDC. Many of the subsistence farmers believe the threats and are afraid to vote for the opposition. An international presence in the rural areas is badly needed. A countrywide voter education campaign is also needed to counteract the misinformation, but neither the EU nor the Commonwealth appear prepared to participate in such a move. Despite the brutality and propaganda, events are not favouring Mr Mugabe. The country's six month-old fuel shortage noticeably worsened this week, with queues of hundreds of cars, taxis, trucks and tractors stretching throughout Harare and the rest of the country. Police had to use teargas to restore order at besieged service stations. Thousands of township households are also affected because the country has run out of paraffin, the main fuel for cooking. The fuel shortage is widely viewed by black and white Zimbabweans alike as the fault of the Zanu-PF government. They blame corruption and disastrous economic policies. Mr Mugabe tried to blame Britain for the crippling shortages, claiming that a British ship was following tankers bringing fuel to the country and offering them double the price to take it elsewhere. \"The British are interfering with our fuel supplies,\" he said. \"They are trying to divert ships with fuel for this country. That is why we say they are bad.\" The British high commission in Harare called the claims \"ridiculous\".",

It is the fifth year they had been in place and by pure coincidence they were only guaranteed for five years. \"The surgery was uncomfortable but I was not in a great deal of pain. When they were removed they were found to be fine and still intact. There was no problems with them - they hadn't leaked and there was no yoghurt-like substance which had been reported in some other cases. It was a big relief to find out they were okay. \"What I want to get across to people is that help is available and they need not be frightened. The worst thing anybody can do is panic because these things can be sorted out. People need to have their implants checked to see if they should be removed.\" Elaine believes that legislation should be used to control cosmetic surgery because she said it was important that people were given the correct information so they could make informed choices. She has not ruled out having more surgery to replace the implants but she regrets ever having surgery. \"I wish I had never had the original implants because of all I have been through - I am still suffering the consequences.\"",

Support of the RUF was part of this strategy. The diamond profits sustained both Mr Taylor and the RUF, and the RUF kept much of the diamond area out of the government's control. Over the years, the Freetown government has fought back, most effectively by giving mining concessions to firms with connections to mercenary outfits like Executive Outcomes and Sandline. Such efforts suggest that unless and until Mr Taylor's influence is curbed by a strong military presence in the diamond area, there can be no end to Sierra Leone's long and terrible war.",

      "body": "<p>Barry Scheck was waiting to pass through security checks on his way into court when a man confronted him. \"Barry,\" he said as he reached out to shake his hand, \"we're going to needle Robert.\"</p> <p>Scheck was confused. Robert Miller was Scheck's latest death row client, a convicted serial killer he believed to be innocent. What was this man talking about? After a moment's thought he recognised him. It was the lawyer in charge of all prosecutions in the local area. \"I'm sorry,\" Barry said, \"I don't know what you mean.\"</p> <p>\"You know, lethal injection, the needle,\" explained the prosecution lawyer. \"We're going to needle Robert.\"</p> <p>Miller eventually won his appeal after DNA evidence showed he was not responsible for a series of murders and was released in 1998. It was another successful case for the Innocence Project, a unique band of campaigning lawyers and students based on the 11th floor of a tower block in downtown Manhattan, New York.</p> <p>On a crisp spring morning, Scheck, the man best known for defending OJ Simpson and the British au pair Louise Woodward, is burrowing through piles of paper on his desk. A mobile phone pressed to one ear, he is trying to locate a trial file and type out an email at the same time. Scheck is the whirlwind of energy at the heart of the Innocence Project. From their offices within the Cardozo School of Law, he and law professor Peter Neufeld pick cases and plot strategy. Their goal is to locate and release the thousands of wrongly convicted inmates they believe are languishing in America's prisons.</p> <p>What makes their approach unique is their focus on the use of DNA fingerprinting: they weed through the thousands of begging letters from inmates and lawyers looking for cases where DNA could swiftly prove a prisoner's innocence.</p> <p>Developed by a scientist at Leicester University, DNA fingerprinting has shifted the odds in favour of those protesting their innocence against a justice system that routinely rejects pleas for cases to be re-examined and that will punish inmates who fail to admit their guilt. \"It's the gold standard of innocence,\" says Scheck. \"The fastest way of pointing to someone and saying 'He didn't do it.' \"</p> <p>So far, at least 70 people owe their freedom, and in death row cases their lives, to the Innocence Project. This week one of Scheck's cases made an impact on the presidential campaign when Governor George W Bush granted a rare reprieve to a convicted child killer, Ricky McGinn, hours before he was due to be executed. Having boasted of overseeing 131 executions in Texas - more than any other governor in the nation - and having maintained that he knew none of them could be innocent, he displayed surprising self-doubt in allowing the inmate more time to conduct DNA tests.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, Scheck and Neufeld's methods have made them enemies in the legal community as local prosecutors around the country are confronted with their past misdeeds. DNA evidence holds up a mirror to the sloppy proceedings, poor police work, corruption and endemic racism that besets the system.</p> <p>Scheck inspires adoration and loathing in equal measure. For some prosecution lawyers, like the one who promised to \"needle\" Robert Miller, it becomes a matter of honour to try to bring this icon of the legal world down a peg or two. His defence of OJ and Woodward earned him the dubious distinction of being voted by one magazine \"The most loathed lawyer of the year\".</p> <p>He learned his uncompromising, hard-talking style growing up in the tough New York neighbourhood of Brooklyn, where his father, a former tap dancer, took young Barry along when he went to hang out with his mobster friends. He won a place at Yale, and after graduation spurned the offers of high-paying legal firms and plumped instead for the decrepit offices of Bronx Legal Aid. It was here that he developed a lifelong interest in forensics, which led inevitably to an interest in DNA and a realisation that for the first time the courts were being offered a way to prove once and for all the guilt or innocence of the accused.</p> <p>There is a palpable sense of urgency in the air at the Innocence Project. Students eat their lunch amid piles of legal documents, phones are constantly ringing, impromptu huddles take place over desks to discuss strategy. All are aware that for many of their clients they are working against time.</p> <p>\"For every seven people executed in the US, one person is exonerated on the grounds of innocence,\" says Scheck. \"Those odds are just terrible. For many people, we're their last hope.\"</p> <p>Ronald Jones for one would agree. He is standing on the porch of his clapboard home near Memphis, Tennessee, contemplating a field of grass swaying in the breeze. \"Ain't that beautiful,\" he says. Just four weeks out of prison and the smallest things still fill him with pleasure and wonderment.</p> <p>Jones contacted Scheck after watching the entire OJ Simpson trial in his cell. \"Boy, that man could talk, and I knew if anyone was going to get me a DNA test to prove my innocence, Barry would,\" he says.</p> <p>As a small-time ex-con who suffered from partial brain damage, Jones was easy pickings for the Chicago police who pulled him in following the 1985 rape-murder of 28-year-old Debra Smith. Jones says he was beaten into confessing that he killed Smith after she took $10 for sex and then would not perform. The fact that they had no evidence to suggest Smith was a prostitute and that she had only slipped out to buy a chicken dinner for her husband seemed not to bother the police and prosecutors. Jones was heading for execution when the Innocence Project finally forced a Chicago judge to approve DNA testing that showed he was not the killer.</p> <p>\"It's strange,\" says Jones with a chuckle, \"you're talking to a dead man right now. But I can't let myself get bitter - I've been given another chance and I intend to enjoy it.\"</p> <p>Scheck has become a passionate advocate for the use of DNA in proving innocence and is surprised that the authorities in Britain do not appear to share his enthusiasm. The national DNA database here contains more than 650,000 profiles and has so far matched evidence found at crime scenes to 75,000 criminals. But, says Scheck, while Britain may be the world leader at putting people in prison using DNA evidence, we have a poor record of exonerating the innocent using the same means.</p> <p>The fact that the Birmingham-based Criminal Cases Review Commission, which looks into miscarriages of justice, says it has only two or three DNA cases on its books, is particularly puzzling for him. \"Frankly, I'm surprised,\" he says. \"I've spoken to them and their docket does not include enough of those cases. I think that solicitors, barristers and families of the inmates who claim innocence, who could use DNA to prove it, should be pushing a lot harder.\"</p> <p>Since his release from jail in Oklahoma, Robert Miller has struggled to come to terms with life on the outside. \"I never saw the sun go up or down, never walked under the moon at night,\" he told his lawyer Gavin Isaacs. \"Never heard a bird singing, or saw a squirrel running in my path. Never felt the wind on my back or the rain in my face. I never went swimming, got my feet wet, walked up in the mud and felt the mud between my toes.\"</p> <p>And the lawyer who bragged to Barry Scheck that he would ensure Miller got \"the needle\"? A few months after Miller's release, he was elected a judge.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Barry Scheck was waiting to pass through security checks on his way into court when a man confronted him. \"Barry,\" he said as he reached out to shake his hand, \"we're going to needle Robert.\" Scheck was confused. Robert Miller was Scheck's latest death row client, a convicted serial killer he believed to be innocent. What was this man talking about? After a moment's thought he recognised him. It was the lawyer in charge of all prosecutions in the local area. \"I'm sorry,\" Barry said, \"I don't know what you mean.\" \"You know, lethal injection, the needle,\" explained the prosecution lawyer. \"We're going to needle Robert.\" Miller eventually won his appeal after DNA evidence showed he was not responsible for a series of murders and was released in 1998. It was another successful case for the Innocence Project, a unique band of campaigning lawyers and students based on the 11th floor of a tower block in downtown Manhattan, New York. On a crisp spring morning, Scheck, the man best known for defending OJ Simpson and the British au pair Louise Woodward, is burrowing through piles of paper on his desk. A mobile phone pressed to one ear, he is trying to locate a trial file and type out an email at the same time. Scheck is the whirlwind of energy at the heart of the Innocence Project. From their offices within the Cardozo School of Law, he and law professor Peter Neufeld pick cases and plot strategy. Their goal is to locate and release the thousands of wrongly convicted inmates they believe are languishing in America's prisons. What makes their approach unique is their focus on the use of DNA fingerprinting: they weed through the thousands of begging letters from inmates and lawyers looking for cases where DNA could swiftly prove a prisoner's innocence. Developed by a scientist at Leicester University, DNA fingerprinting has shifted the odds in favour of those protesting their innocence against a justice system that routinely rejects pleas for cases to be re-examined and that will punish inmates who fail to admit their guilt. \"It's the gold standard of innocence,\" says Scheck. \"The fastest way of pointing to someone and saying 'He didn't do it.' \" So far, at least 70 people owe their freedom, and in death row cases their lives, to the Innocence Project. This week one of Scheck's cases made an impact on the presidential campaign when Governor George W Bush granted a rare reprieve to a convicted child killer, Ricky McGinn, hours before he was due to be executed. Having boasted of overseeing 131 executions in Texas - more than any other governor in the nation - and having maintained that he knew none of them could be innocent, he displayed surprising self-doubt in allowing the inmate more time to conduct DNA tests. Unsurprisingly, Scheck and Neufeld's methods have made them enemies in the legal community as local prosecutors around the country are confronted with their past misdeeds. DNA evidence holds up a mirror to the sloppy proceedings, poor police work, corruption and endemic racism that besets the system. Scheck inspires adoration and loathing in equal measure. For some prosecution lawyers, like the one who promised to \"needle\" Robert Miller, it becomes a matter of honour to try to bring this icon of the legal world down a peg or two. His defence of OJ and Woodward earned him the dubious distinction of being voted by one magazine \"The most loathed lawyer of the year\". He learned his uncompromising, hard-talking style growing up in the tough New York neighbourhood of Brooklyn, where his father, a former tap dancer, took young Barry along when he went to hang out with his mobster friends. He won a place at Yale, and after graduation spurned the offers of high-paying legal firms and plumped instead for the decrepit offices of Bronx Legal Aid. It was here that he developed a lifelong interest in forensics, which led inevitably to an interest in DNA and a realisation that for the first time the courts were being offered a way to prove once and for all the guilt or innocence of the accused. There is a palpable sense of urgency in the air at the Innocence Project. Students eat their lunch amid piles of legal documents, phones are constantly ringing, impromptu huddles take place over desks to discuss strategy. All are aware that for many of their clients they are working against time. \"For every seven people executed in the US, one person is exonerated on the grounds of innocence,\" says Scheck. \"Those odds are just terrible. For many people, we're their last hope.\" Ronald Jones for one would agree. He is standing on the porch of his clapboard home near Memphis, Tennessee, contemplating a field of grass swaying in the breeze. \"Ain't that beautiful,\" he says. Just four weeks out of prison and the smallest things still fill him with pleasure and wonderment. Jones contacted Scheck after watching the entire OJ Simpson trial in his cell. \"Boy, that man could talk, and I knew if anyone was going to get me a DNA test to prove my innocence, Barry would,\" he says. As a small-time ex-con who suffered from partial brain damage, Jones was easy pickings for the Chicago police who pulled him in following the 1985 rape-murder of 28-year-old Debra Smith. Jones says he was beaten into confessing that he killed Smith after she took $10 for sex and then would not perform. The fact that they had no evidence to suggest Smith was a prostitute and that she had only slipped out to buy a chicken dinner for her husband seemed not to bother the police and prosecutors. Jones was heading for execution when the Innocence Project finally forced a Chicago judge to approve DNA testing that showed he was not the killer. \"It's strange,\" says Jones with a chuckle, \"you're talking to a dead man right now. But I can't let myself get bitter - I've been given another chance and I intend to enjoy it.\" Scheck has become a passionate advocate for the use of DNA in proving innocence and is surprised that the authorities in Britain do not appear to share his enthusiasm. The national DNA database here contains more than 650,000 profiles and has so far matched evidence found at crime scenes to 75,000 criminals. But, says Scheck, while Britain may be the world leader at putting people in prison using DNA evidence, we have a poor record of exonerating the innocent using the same means. The fact that the Birmingham-based Criminal Cases Review Commission, which looks into miscarriages of justice, says it has only two or three DNA cases on its books, is particularly puzzling for him. \"Frankly, I'm surprised,\" he says. \"I've spoken to them and their docket does not include enough of those cases. I think that solicitors, barristers and families of the inmates who claim innocence, who could use DNA to prove it, should be pushing a lot harder.\" Since his release from jail in Oklahoma, Robert Miller has struggled to come to terms with life on the outside. \"I never saw the sun go up or down, never walked under the moon at night,\" he told his lawyer Gavin Isaacs. \"Never heard a bird singing, or saw a squirrel running in my path. Never felt the wind on my back or the rain in my face. I never went swimming, got my feet wet, walked up in the mud and felt the mud between my toes.\" And the lawyer who bragged to Barry Scheck that he would ensure Miller got \"the needle\"? A few months after Miller's release, he was elected a judge.",

In the Los Angeles County Superior Court on May 19, a $1m lawsuit was brought against the Godfather Of Soul for sexual harassment and unfair dismissal. And, frankly, it isn't going be easy convincing a jury that your client is a shy, retiring and abstemious man when they've had it drummed into their heads for three decades that he's a sex machine. </p> <p>The statement on behalf of the plaintiff - Lisa Ross Agbalaya, who used to work for New James Brown Enterprises - even uses that song as their opening gambit. \"It appears that 'Sex Machine' is more than simply a title to one of James Brown's many hit records; it would also appear to be a description for James Brown the man.\" According to Agbalaya, Brown told her that the government had given him bull testicles so that he could come \"harder and stronger than ever\". </p> <p>Of course, Brown is no stranger to the court room, having spent three years inside after threatening a random group of businessmen with a shotgun, and then unsuccessfully trying to speed away from the police down the freeway.

      "bodyText": "Spare a thought for the lawyers of James Brown lawyers. In the Los Angeles County Superior Court on May 19, a $1m lawsuit was brought against the Godfather Of Soul for sexual harassment and unfair dismissal. And, frankly, it isn't going be easy convincing a jury that your client is a shy, retiring and abstemious man when they've had it drummed into their heads for three decades that he's a sex machine. The statement on behalf of the plaintiff - Lisa Ross Agbalaya, who used to work for New James Brown Enterprises - even uses that song as their opening gambit. \"It appears that 'Sex Machine' is more than simply a title to one of James Brown's many hit records; it would also appear to be a description for James Brown the man.\" According to Agbalaya, Brown told her that the government had given him bull testicles so that he could come \"harder and stronger than ever\". Of course, Brown is no stranger to the court room, having spent three years inside after threatening a random group of businessmen with a shotgun, and then unsuccessfully trying to speed away from the police down the freeway. He was also sued in 1998 by a woman who claimed that he had held her hostage. It's just as well his lawyers are well paid: for once, they are going to have to earn it. And so, by a logical progression, to this week's traditional hip-hop story. The ever charming Eminem (Marshall Mathers to the courts) was nicked in the early hours of Sunday morning after a punch-up at a Detroit club. Apparently, Marshall was lounging with some homies - and, oddly enough, the woman he keeps threatening to kill on his records - when some punters thought they'd have a go.

Meeting Andrew Bovell, co-writer of Strictly Ballroom and author of Speaking in Tongues, which comes to Hampstead Theatre this week, I felt cheered by his affirmation of faith. He arrived on his first visit to Britain from Australia a month ago wondering whether his future lay in film. \"What I've discovered,\" he says, \"is a culture that still seems to celebrate the craft of the playwright. I'm going to go back home bursting to write.\" </p> <p>Bovell was born in Kalgoorlie, a mining-town in Western Australia, and later studied drama in Melbourne. He started writing plays in the 80s for the Melbourne Workers Theatre - which was literally based in a train-maintenance depot. </p> <p>\"The workforce,\" he says, \"was winding down but there was an incredibly rich fund of stories as people had to make decisions about their future. We'd perform in the depot to mechanics, metalworkers, electricians and cleaners. </p> <p>\"My generation,\" Bovell continues, \"defined itself against what came before: people like Ray Lawler, David Williamson, Jack Hibberd. Their concerns were very specific: who are we? what kind of country do we want to be? Those aren't our preoccupations. We know who we are. The great cultural preoccupation of the moment is reconciliation between black and white. And there's a lot of energy coming from the artistic community on that subject because we have a government that pretends it doesn't exist.\" </p> <p>Reconciliation between black and white is not the only issue. Bovell describes his play, Speaking in Tongues, as \"part thriller, part conundrum about the nature of commitment, betrayal, the loss of trust between men and women. The audience is confronted by nine parallel stories and is left to fit the pieces together. If theatre is going to separate itself from film, it has to find new forms.\" </p> <p>But film remains one of Bovell's passions: he points out that a writer can't sustain a career in Australian theatre. Unusually, he also started out by co-writing a global hit in the shape of Strictly Ballroom. \"It began as a group-devised work at Nida (the Sydney drama school) where it was simply dance-sequences with dramatic tableaux. My task was to fill out the plot so that the love story of Scott and Fran became a metaphor for Australian multiculturalism. At the same time, Baz Luhrmann kept urging me to keep it simple: we looked at a lot of Hollywood 40s dance-musicals and used their boy-meets-girl structure. I thought we'd made a strange little film: Baz was convinced it would reach a wide audience. But, though I could have gone on to become part of his team, I broke away because I had too many stories to tell.\" </p> <p>Since then Bovell has co-written a cult film called Head On about a young gay Greek-Australian and a much-admired play entitled Who's Afraid of the Working Class. But, having listened to siren-voices at home telling him the playwright is dead, his London exposure to plays like Blue/Orange and Dolly West's Kitchen has left him fired with new enthusiasm. It's a salutary reminder that our theatre's reputation still rests heavily on our dramatists. It sometimes takes a wayfarer from Oz to point that out. </p> <p>Speaking in Tongues opens tomorrow at Hampstead Theatre, London (020-7722 9301).</p>",

Tale one about the band is that their last album, Come Down, is a dreamy wash of psychedelic pop with more harmonies than a resort of Beach Boys. You might recall the catchy late 90s boredom of Not If You Were The Last Junkie On Earth: \"I never thought you'd be a junkie because heroin is so pass\u00e9.\" </p> <p>It is early afternoon and singer and guitarist Courtney Taylor, bass and keyboard player Zia McCabe, guitarist Peter Holmstrom and new drummer Brent De Boer are physically in a Kensington restaurant, but are mentally occupying mid-west time. McCabe's confession that \"I normally don't let the band members taste my Woo-Woo\" refers to a cocktail that is designed for this conversational double entendre, but the Portland band are bored by their press billing as rock'n'roll orgiasts. Taylor winces: \"The press around Come Down was all about 'crazy, wacky, randy, dandy, sex-crazed, drug' - like a bunch of fuckin' amateurs. It was embarrassing.\" </p> <p>If their name is a flippant gesture to the king of the 60s art world, there are also musical tics to Andy Warhol's house band. You can hear echoes of the Velvet Underground in the Dandys' hypnotic song structure, and the faux-dry Lou Reed timbre of Taylor's vocals on tracks such as Solid. </p> <p>Taylor describes the shift in sound on the new album as \"hypnosis\": \"It seems so fucking easy for us to lay on 15 tracks of guitar. But with this album it was 'Can I do this with just the melody, without layering on harmonies?' There's not nearly as many harmonies on this record.\" </p> <p>Compared to the Velvet Underground's tight roll-neck, loft-space psychedelia, the Dandys' psychedelia is big, warm and communal. Despite the weariness about rock'n'roll excess, the inspiration for their name came partly from Warhol's legendary parties at the Factory. Taylor reflects: \"Our scene was pretty much exactly the same as the Factory, with film-makers, painters, musicians.\" </p> <p>Whereas Warhol's parties were productions, the Portland scene is devoid of east coast self-consciousness. Taylor says: \"We had parties but they were a lot more fun, a lot less strung out, and a lot more naked in the pool. In Portland it's not cool to be strung out but it's still cool to be beautiful, smart, and get naked with your friends.\" Taylor adds, in the self-mocking tone of their songs: \"At least we made it fashionable for a while.\" </p> <p>It has been three years since the last album which would normally mean a flurry of record company memos. But the band are relaxed about it, says Taylor: \"The battles we fight with [the] label are about time and the resources. Time, genius, or money? Pick any two.\" </p> <p>Listening to both Come Down and Thirteen Tales From Urban Bohemia you get the sense of a band playing out the history of rock. Every track seems like a hallucination of great pop hooks and melodies from the Byrds to the Stones and Nirvana. But the songs fool you into thinking you have heard them before simply because they sound like classic pop. </p> <p>By definition, great pop is sexy and its basic formula is the reduction of sound to a singular irresistible feeling. Taylor explains his songwriting process: \"Every song has one specific emotion with only enough movement to keep it maybe playing out into every corner of that room. You know that these chords, in that order with these melodies, produces this emotion.\" </p> <p>And sex? \"The thing about your music being sexual is that certain things like harmonies and the high-end open up the top of your head. What's happening in the low-mid range gives you that physical con stitution.\" The new album opens with the bitter Godless, a track filled with acoustic guitar, feedback and the Mariachi sound of a trumpet lament. </p> <p>It is followed by the spooky falsetto and Gimme Shelter-guitar licks of Mohammed, and then the five-minute long Nietzsche, where west coast pop meets thumping Sturm and Drang over the graffiti philosophy \"I wanna God who stays dead not plays dead\". </p> <p>Big themes? \"Yeah they're a philosophy roll-call,\" says Taylor. The lyrics to Nietzsche confirm the fact that student toilets are the contemporary equivalent of Plato's Academy. As McCabe explains: \"When Courtney said they were on the bathroom wall I thought he was speaking metaphorically but it really was on the bathroom wall.\" </p> <p>There's more variety on the new album with songs like Big Indian, a piece of epic country pop sung by Taylor in the tones of Ray Davies, and the head shaking, body sway ing Bohemian Like You. So where does the title come from? \"That's what all the lyrics are about, me writing about me or me writing about us,\" says Taylor. \"Everything that happens in our lives is so fucking urban bohemian. We're so not suburban, and we're not urban chic at all, we're just a bunch of modern hippies.\" </p> <p>The gossipy stories of the band's excess do communicate something about the Dandys. The bizarre X-rated panto of the music business is Warhol's Factory writ large and given their inspiration it would be surprising if the band did not have a take on it. </p> <p>They put the ease into sleaze. Like the story of one of their label bosses who, Taylor says admiringly, \"is a sleazy, sleazy man. He's the coolest guy in corporate rock.

Or, if you prefer: Architecture creates the backdrop to our city lives, making it the one art form in which each of us is daily implicated. </p> <p>These aren't my words, you understand. They are screen captions from a new TV series about architecture. Of course, it has never occurred to 99% of the population that they might be lifestyle fetishists, or that their homes might implicate them in anything approaching an art form. After all, the message put across by the usual crop of TV building shows is that you live in it, you decorate it, and you might just try sticking up a few DIY cupboard units. </p> <p>But Space comes as a welcome change. This three-part series explores a selection of modern homes and the people who live in them, and it does it well.

This is just as well, because this sort of quality is needed to make up for the fact that the architectural subject matter can be rather tedious. </p> <p>One of the problems with modern architecture is that the profession itself hijacked the term \"modern\" in the 1920s, leaving the rest of us to get confused about the differences between modernism and modernity. And of course anything more modern than modern is post-modern, if you get my drift. Modernism is also closely linked with minimalism and functionalism, which is why most people associate modern domestic architecture with uncluttered open-plan spaces, bare white walls and stainless steel staircases leading up to spartan sleeping platforms. Funnily enough, this stereotype does crop up remarkably frequently in Space. All spontaneous individual creations by the architects concerned, of course. </p> <p>But some of the homes explored in the series are genuinely interesting. The first programme kicks off with Labour MP Bob Marshall-Andrews, who lives with his wife in a glass and concrete flying saucer snuggled into the Pembrokeshire coast. Their tranquil home life is disturbed only by the sound of screeching brakes, as passing tourists stop to gawp and take photographs. </p> <p>Not far away is a different type of modern house, built from mud and logs by a solstice-worshipping drop-out from the civil service. Tony Wrench's break with the daily office grind came after his management appraisal interview. What do you see yourself doing in five years time, they asked him. Tony decided to take to the hills. This tale, and his frank description of how to use his composting toilet, are gems. </p> <p>But most of the homes explored in the series are real modern modern, even those like Richard Rogers' London pad which has a new functionalist interior within the gutted shell of a Georgian terrace. Rogers is famous for the Pompidou Centre and the Lloyds Building, so when the local council granted him planning permission to remodel his house they asked if he wouldn't mind keeping the plumbing on the inside of the building. </p> <p>John Young's functionalist London penthouse is so famous that it has become a shrine for worshipping architecture students. On an open day one admirer is waxing lyrical about the design: \"one can live modern like this,\" he enthuses, \"and this is today - and I think it's fun to be today\". Cut to another visitor knocking himself almost unconscious on a protruding piece of stainless steel. Another gem. </p> <p>John Young's colleagues rib him that if he ever sells the flat they'll be waiting outside to salvage all the bits that the new owners chuck into the skip. His wife couldn't stand it and moved out with their child. </p> <p>In fact a dominant theme that emerges from the series is that modernist architecture really does seem to be a boy's thing. In the interviews the women are mostly absent or silent, or when they do speak it is to voice concerns, especially about the impracticalities of the designs in relation to their children. Some of the ordered modernist spaces shown in the series are not only free of clutter; they seem to be free of anything . Bare white walls and nothing else. Surely nobody can really live like that. Tell me they've tidied up specially for the cameras. But when there are children on the scene, there is no way of avoiding the mess, so where does that leave the concept of functionalism, exactly? </p> <p>The last word in the series lies with John Pawson, described as the godfather of minimalism, and another architect whose home is a gutted Victorian terraced house with a plain white interior. His wife insisted on a sofa and a rug, but he still won't let her put her photographs up on the walls. He describes minimalism as a fight against the natural human instinct to collect things.

      "bodyText": "Our homes have become a fetishised leisure pursuit in which experts urge us to walk the holy grail to lifestyle perfection. Or, if you prefer: Architecture creates the backdrop to our city lives, making it the one art form in which each of us is daily implicated. These aren't my words, you understand. They are screen captions from a new TV series about architecture. Of course, it has never occurred to 99% of the population that they might be lifestyle fetishists, or that their homes might implicate them in anything approaching an art form. After all, the message put across by the usual crop of TV building shows is that you live in it, you decorate it, and you might just try sticking up a few DIY cupboard units.

      "body": "<p>Wembley in the summer of 1996: Gareth Southgate is stepping up to take that penalty. The one that seemed to take an eternity to roll across the turf. In reality it's a split second, during which Ravi Deepres reacts faster than the German goalkeeper. One eye takes in events on the pitch, while the other focuses on a section of the crowd. His camera catches them at the very moment where tension drains from their faces to be replaced by stunned disbelief. </p> <p>Only a few minutes earlier he had photographed the same people celebrating England's penalty. \"They were different from one another and I'm sure they hadn't known each other before the game,\" he recalls. \"Yet all their movements are the same.\" All bar one. On the edge of the picture is a man in specs looking pensive. Obviously a German. </p> <p>Paris in the summer of 1998: France have just won the World Cup and, on the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, Deepres is trapped in a crush of humanity. For the first time in his photographic tour of major football events, he feels frightened. He sees cars being turned over and feels that the celebratory mayhem is being infiltrated by dark forces. \"Some of the French hooligans put the fear of God into me,\" he admits. But he holds his video camera above his head long enough to capture the image he wants. </p> <p>Safely back home, he fed it through the TV set and photographed it from the screen. \"I wanted a coarse and grainy texture to disrupt the image,\" he says. \"Then I processed it through a computer to make subtle manipulations.\" The result is similar to an impressionistic painting, conveying a sense of danger. Faces are indistinct. Clouds of smoke can be seen in the background while the foreground is dominated by that part of the French flag which is blood red. </p> <p>Birmingham's Jewellery Quarter in the summer of 2000: Deepres is in the offices of Vivid, a production centre for media arts, trying to decide which of his images to show in a forthcoming exhibition. Vivid is showcasing 10 artists, but Deepres's work is likely to take centre stage. \"We've moved the event back a week to the eve of Euro 2000,\" says the director, Yasmin Baig Clifford. \"Ravi's images tie in with it so well.\" </p> <p>His final show will probably be a triptych with a video screen at the centre, linking two still print images. The pre- and post-Southgate penalty photographs are contenders. So is the crowd scene on the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, and a close-up of a French fan with face painted. It was taken outside St James' Park, Newcastle, during Euro 96. When Deepres approached with his camera, he was told in impeccable English, to \"fuck off\". He did. But from a safe distance, he used a zoom video lens. </p> <p>\"It gave me a degenerated, rough image which seemed appropriate,\" he says. \"What intrigues me is that some fans dress normally for matches and others dress up and paint their faces to the point where their nationality takes over from their individuality. Their whole psychology changes and they become part of a mass for one day. I'm using football to explore the notion of identity.\" </p> <p>What drew him to a particular section of the Wembley crowd during the England-Germany penalty shootout was a tall, rangy black man. To his left was a studious-looking youth, the red cross of St George underscoring his spectacles. To his right is a man with blue eyes and a receding hairline, wearing a check shirt. The black man, like everybody else, is punching the air to celebrate England scoring a penalty. Yet his white T-shirt is inscribed with \"Jamaica\". </p> <p>No wonder Deepres was intrigued. His own identity might be considered even more confused. He was born in Liverpool 30 years ago, the son of an Indian sea captain and an English woman with a Flemish name. His father died when he was two and young Ravi moved around the country with his mother. She has now settled down as an organic farmer in Devon while he moves between homes in London and Birmingham. He is an occasional visiting lecturer in fine art photography at Newcastle University. As that is the city where he spent more of his childhood than anywhere else, he supports Newcastle United. England as well, despite having been at closer quarters with its hardcore fans longer than some of us might care to. </p> <p>\"I'm not saying that I'd go around with the Chelsea Headhunters. No way,\" he says. \"You can usually tell when any trouble's about to start and make a sharp exit. Most of the fans are fairly good-natured. I usually tell them I'm doing pics for the paper and they're quite happy. They're drunk most of the time, and the Scottish supporters even more so.\" </p> <p>He was at Wembley for two recent matches against England's old enemies - Germany in 1996 and Scotland last year. On both occasions there was no shortage of banter or bile on display. Yet some of his most memorable pictures from those great crowd-pulling events reveal no faces at all. One of the twin towers is reflected in the shimmering water of a leaf-strewn puddle. A St George's flag, illuminated with gold lights from using a long exposure, is unfurled like a knight's pennant to reveal the illustrious name of Bournemouth FC. Hand gestures aimed at the Germans are captured at a moment when they have an almost balletic gracefulness. Perhaps it is no coincidence that his other major interest is modern dance. </p> <p>But football is his passion. \"A few people making gestures can lead to anything up to 50,000 following suit. Large movements of fans intrigue me. It can be like a strong current of water, pushing and pulling you along.\" As he discovered in Paris, the current can sometimes run out of control. Undeterred, he is planning to head for the Low Countries after the Birmingham exhibition. Euro 2000 beckons. </p> <p>Some of Ravi Deepres's football work will be on show at Vivid, Now! in the Big Peg in Warstone Lane, Birmingham (0121-233 4061) tomorrow and Friday.</p>",

He looked as glamorous - the only word - as Douglas Fairbanks. </p> <p>The late Alan Clark, a family friend, popped up to flash that vulpine smile and admit that the womanising Eden (\"he always smelt delicious\") took a crack at his own mother. But, despite the Military Cross at 20, the hard work and the 1938 resignation as Foreign Secretary over appeasement - or was it pique? - men always had their doubts. </p> <p>So did Barbara Castle. She called Eden a Noel Coward character with no grit or judgement. Lord Bill Deedes mistrusted his weakness for double-breasted waistcoats (\"so did my tailor\"). Most damning of all, Milne's film reminded us that, on his last night in Downing St, the great Churchill had sat on his bed and declared: \"You know, I don't think Anthony can do it.\" It took barely a year to find he couldn't. </p> <p>Whichever way you slice it, this film was a case of lost opportunities. We all know Eden secretly colluded with France and Israel to invade Suez, the final fling of the doomed British Empire. But why did he try to deceive his friend Eisenhower in the week (unmentioned here) of the 1956 presidential election? And why did he think Nasser was another Hitler anyway? </p> <p>Was it his illness, the pills he needed after the botched operation on his gall bladder? Vanity, the impatience of a crown prince eager to prove himself ? Or something deeper? As someone once quipped, Eden's trouble was that he was \"half beautiful woman, half mad baronet\", the child of privileged but spectacularly bad parenting. </p> <p>Interesting, eh? But we hardly got a word of it from Reputations. Nor of the horror of the Flanders trenches which made the teenage officer a Tory liberal and paternalist, a vehement opponent of war. Odd that, because it had the opposite effect on Corporal Hitler, with whom Eden spoke at length in the 30s (\"I rather liked [his] shyness\") and may have shot at in 1916. (They fought in the same sector on the Somme.) </p> <p>Sir Anthony would not have coped as well with the kids, the cooking and the washing machine as father-of-two Cliff Slades did when his wife, Julie, went to France for two weeks. In <strong> Can You Live Without Your Wife?</strong> (Channel 4) Cliff was shown just-about coping as Beth (12) and Mike (10) grappled with homework, hormones and Dad's curry. </p> <p>It can hardly be claimed that the experience turned Cliff into a New Man, since he called his mum over as soon as he found he couldn't open the washing machine door.

A DTI spokesman said yesterday that the case had now been settled. \"We received a letter from Mr Nokes on May 26 saying the two parties had come to an agreement.\" The bank declined to comment.",

Teresa Browning, 34, and her husband Kevin, 36, are on trial at Winchester crown court jointly accused of the manslaughter of Barry Gates. A jury was told how Gates, 44, collapsed and died after drinking from a pint glass filled with whisky, gin, vodka, bacardi and brandy. Mrs Browning was licensee at the Kingston Tavern, Kingston Road, Portsmouth, when Gates died on June 7 last year. The defendants deny manslaughter in what is thought to be the first case of its kind in the country. Anthony Davis QC, prosecuting, told the jury of six men and six women how Gates, a father of one from Portsmouth, was already drunk when he arrived at the pub shortly after 12.30pm. \"During the course of the afternoon in the Kingston Tavern, Mr Gates, who was known to the defendants Kevin and Teresa Browning, was drinking at the bar, interspersed with games of pool,\" said Mr Davis. \"There then came a discussion which revolved around a bet being made between the defendants and Barry Gates. \"The bet, it seemed, initially concerned drinking measures from each of the optics on the top shelf behind the bar. \"It seems that they were trying to pressure Barry Gates into drinking that concoction and that a payment of \u00a327 was mentioned.\" Mr Davis told the court how the defendants \"egged, goaded and cajoled\" Gates into drinking three-quarters of a pint glass which had been filled with a mixture from the \"house doubles\". \"He did succumb to the pressure.

He was eventually placed on a bench and emergency services were called when it became apparent he was seriously unwell. Gates was taken to Queen Alexandra hospital at Cosham but was certified dead within 30 minutes of arriving. \"It's the crown's case that these two defendants owed to the drunken Barry Gates a duty of care, when so drunk he was incapable of controlling adequately, or at all, his thoughts and movements,\" Mr Davis said. \"They, say the crown, breached that duty and behaved in a reckless and negligent manner. \"In all the circumstances, the crown say that the negligence was gross, such that it may possibly be deemed to be criminal.\" The trial continues.",

He was born in the Ukraine, to a father he described as a Red Army commander who fell victim to Stalin's purges. But in one interview, he said his father, Nikolai, was a village blacksmith. His early career at the Rostov-on-Don flying academy ended after he had a leg amputated, following an accident, and he transferred to the medical institute. After post-graduate studies, he was appointed head of a regional eye institute.</p> <p>In 1960, he performed the first artificial lens implantation in the Soviet Union, and worked on the production of crystalline lenses. In 1967, he moved to Moscow as head of the artificial lens implantation laboratory, working on surgical treatments for glaucoma.</p> <p>By the early 1970s, Fyodorov had developed his surgical technique for correcting myopia, by making a series of small cuts into the cornea, which, when they heal, make the cornea contract and vision improve. His approach required less precision than similar operations performed in Japan in the 1940s, and thus allowed surgeons to be more certain of the outcome. At first, the work was denounced as anti-physiological, but by 1980 it was recognised both in the Soviet Union and abroad, and Fyodorov was appointed director of the Moscow institute of eye micro-surgery.</p> <p>Unusually, he was allowed to keep the majority of his hard-currency earnings, using the money to buy hi-tech equipment from West Germany and develop a conveyor-belt technique for patients, who lay on operating tables which rotated from surgeon to surgeon - allowing the operation to be performed in little more than 15 minutes.</p> <p>By 1986, growing economic liberalism under Gorbachev made it possible for Fyodorov to open his own string of independent clinics and fit out a passenger ship as a mobile operating theatre. At first he was seen as a figurehead for what could be possible under perestroika, but two years later became a focus of attacks from hardline communists.</p> <p>Strange patients began turning up at his home, two of his surgeons were arrested on trumped-up bribery charges, and eventually a prominent Soviet politician demanded that he hand over 80% of his foreign currency earnings to the state. Fyodorov fought back, telling a pro-reform newspaper: \"The fight for power is now the fight for property. If people get property, they will get power. If not, they will forever remain hired hands.\"</p> <p>In 1989, he was elected to the Congress of People's Deputies and, as an advocate of privatisation, was offered the post of prime minister by Yeltsin in 1991, which he declined. He left the pro-Yeltsin Democratic party of Russia and joined the Party of Economic Freedom. His ideas of economic liberalisation trod a third way between the communists and Yeltsin's full-scale adoption of free-market capitalism.</p> <p>What Fyodorov termed \"democratic capitalism\" or \"popular socialism\" was, he said, inspired by Deng Xiaoping in China and Ross Perot in the United States. In 1995, he formed the Party of Workers' Self Rule and was elected to the State Duma, remaining a deputy until his death.</p> <p>Fyodorov's failure in the 1996 presidential election was indicative of the way that liberal economic ideas have failed to capture Russian voters. He also attracted criticism for an incautious remark about Hitler having done much to restore German pride. He did, however, remain in the public arena, giving his employees a share of the profits from his clinics, which expanded overseas, and branching out as a sharp and able businessman in other areas.</p> <p>His last public statement reflected his aims as a surgeon and a politician. \"We have one goal. To make it so that people live well, so that they see well . . . we are proving the potential of the Russian people, the potential of its talents, the potential of self-organisation, the potential of enterprises being self-sufficient, the potential of regions being self-sufficient.\"</p> <p>Fyodorov married three times, and is survived by his wife and four daughters.</p> <p>Sviatoslav Fyodorov, ophthalmologist, surgeon and politician, born August 8 1927; died June 2 2000</p>",

Unusually, he was allowed to keep the majority of his hard-currency earnings, using the money to buy hi-tech equipment from West Germany and develop a conveyor-belt technique for patients, who lay on operating tables which rotated from surgeon to surgeon - allowing the operation to be performed in little more than 15 minutes. By 1986, growing economic liberalism under Gorbachev made it possible for Fyodorov to open his own string of independent clinics and fit out a passenger ship as a mobile operating theatre. At first he was seen as a figurehead for what could be possible under perestroika, but two years later became a focus of attacks from hardline communists. Strange patients began turning up at his home, two of his surgeons were arrested on trumped-up bribery charges, and eventually a prominent Soviet politician demanded that he hand over 80% of his foreign currency earnings to the state. Fyodorov fought back, telling a pro-reform newspaper: \"The fight for power is now the fight for property. If people get property, they will get power. If not, they will forever remain hired hands.\" In 1989, he was elected to the Congress of People's Deputies and, as an advocate of privatisation, was offered the post of prime minister by Yeltsin in 1991, which he declined. He left the pro-Yeltsin Democratic party of Russia and joined the Party of Economic Freedom. His ideas of economic liberalisation trod a third way between the communists and Yeltsin's full-scale adoption of free-market capitalism. What Fyodorov termed \"democratic capitalism\" or \"popular socialism\" was, he said, inspired by Deng Xiaoping in China and Ross Perot in the United States. In 1995, he formed the Party of Workers' Self Rule and was elected to the State Duma, remaining a deputy until his death. Fyodorov's failure in the 1996 presidential election was indicative of the way that liberal economic ideas have failed to capture Russian voters. He also attracted criticism for an incautious remark about Hitler having done much to restore German pride. He did, however, remain in the public arena, giving his employees a share of the profits from his clinics, which expanded overseas, and branching out as a sharp and able businessman in other areas. His last public statement reflected his aims as a surgeon and a politician. \"We have one goal. To make it so that people live well, so that they see well . . . we are proving the potential of the Russian people, the potential of its talents, the potential of self-organisation, the potential of enterprises being self-sufficient, the potential of regions being self-sufficient.\" Fyodorov married three times, and is survived by his wife and four daughters. Sviatoslav Fyodorov, ophthalmologist, surgeon and politician, born August 8 1927; died June 2 2000",

      "body": "<p>The influence of Cardinal Vincentas Sladkevicius, who has died aged 79, would probably have been less if the Soviet authorities in Lithuania had left him alone.</p> <p>Exile from his diocese, Kaisiadorys, to a remote village for 23 years - from 1959-82 - increased his hold over his people. He became a focal point for petitions by priests and laity, for religious liberty in general and for his reinstatement (together with that of Bishop Julijonas Steponavicius of Vilnius) in particular. His quiet determination and modest bearing united the people behind the common front of church and secular forces.</p> <p>Sladkevicius was born into a humble farming family.

      "bodyText": "The influence of Cardinal Vincentas Sladkevicius, who has died aged 79, would probably have been less if the Soviet authorities in Lithuania had left him alone. Exile from his diocese, Kaisiadorys, to a remote village for 23 years - from 1959-82 - increased his hold over his people. He became a focal point for petitions by priests and laity, for religious liberty in general and for his reinstatement (together with that of Bishop Julijonas Steponavicius of Vilnius) in particular. His quiet determination and modest bearing united the people behind the common front of church and secular forces. Sladkevicius was born into a humble farming family. The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, followed by the Soviet invasion of 1940 and subjugation to the Germans a year later, produced a shock which hardened his young resolve. He studied at a Catholic school, entered the Kaunas seminary in 1939 and was ordained as a priest in March 1944. Serious Soviet persecution of religion began soon after the end of the second world war, the Catholic church being (rightly) viewed as a bastion of Lithuanian nationalism. Sladkevicius managed to evade deportation by carrying out his priestly duties mainly in secret. His nomination in 1952 to a permanent post at the only Catholic theological seminary in the USSR (Kaunas) was followed by the death of Stalin and a slight hiatus in the anti-religious campaign. His consecration as a bishop was carried out secretly by Bishop Teofilius Matulionis on Christmas Day, 1957. But by then, Khrushchev's persecution had begun. Sladkevicius was barred from the seminary, and, two years later, was exiled without accusation or trial to the remote village of Nemunelio Radviliskis. Ironically, this move served only to heighten his profile. His actual living conditions were tolerable; at times, he could receive visitors, increasingly so as Lithuanian believers began raising his case internationally. Sladkevicius encouraged the compilation, translation into Russian and clandestine dispatch abroad of the Chronicle of the Lithuanian Catholic Church, which, from 1972, was one of the most influential samizdat publications. Among its most reiterated themes was the demand for the return to diocesan administration of Sladkevicius himself. By the time the Soviet authorities allowed this, on June 8 1982, he was president of the Lithuanian Bishops' Conference. On his visit to Rome in May 1988, he was appointed Archbishop of Kaunas and the first Lithuanian cardinal for 400 years. Mikhail Gorbachev's perestroika policies had come later to Lithuanian Catholics than to the Russian Orthodox church, but when conditions did ease - with the reconsecration of Vilnius cathedral in February 1989 - church leaders, taking their cue from the cardinal, were as vocal as secular figures in calling for Lithuanian independence. This came finally at the end of 1991, with the collapse of Soviet communism, by which time Sladkevicius was a sick man. The culmination of his life's work came when he received Pope John Paul II in Vilnius and Kaunas in September 1993. He retired in 1996, and was able to hand over a flourishing diocese to Archbishop Sigitas Tamkevicius, who himself had been released from prison only eight years earlier.
