      "body": "<p>Two goals in the last 12 minutes by the substitute Kanu and the outstanding Dennis Bergkamp all but assured Arsenal of a place in the quarter-finals as they overwhelmed the Spanish league leaders Deportivo la Coruna in a display of pace, power and, most importantly, goals. </p> <p>Kanu's strike especially will always live in the memory of the Arsenal faithful. Pouncing on a defensive error he headed the ball clear of the chasing pack of Deportivo's defenders and let it run. With sublime skill, elegance and confidence which verged on arrogance, he just flicked his right foot over the ball twisted his waist and with keeper Songo'o falling on his back the Nigerian walked the ball into the net in what must surely go down as a classic moment in football history. With two touches he covered 30 yards beating defence and goalkeeper and walked the ball in the net. Magic.</p> <p>Arsenal knew victory was essential to give them real hope of progressing to a tie with Parma or Werder Bremen. And Ars\u00e8ne Wenger must have been confident given that Deportivo had travelled as well as Bergkamp in the lead-up to this tie, losing four of the past five away games. </p> <p>With the exception of the suspended Patrick Vieira, the Arsenal manager could choose from a full complement of players. And he surprised everyone by dropping not only Kanu and Ray Parlour to the bench but, most significantly, the captain Tony Adams. Last week Adams said he had been \"kicking butt\" in training. Now he was kicking his heels. </p> <p>The pre-match explanation from Wenger was that the 33-year-old had a \"small physical problem\" after his return from an absence of almost two months at the weekend. </p> <p>The unenviable task of filling Adams's boots fell to the Ukranian Oleg Luzhny. Also drafted in were Gilles Grimandi, Marc Overmars and Thierry Henry, and the pace of the latter two was instrumental to Arsenal's fantastic start. </p> <p>With Bergkamp also in excellent form, Arsenal were irrestible. Playing at a far quicker tempo than Deportivo would have wanted, and passing and moving with purpose, they were two up inside half an hour. </p> <p>The first arrived after only five minutes. Henry, a constant menace with his pace, was the architect. He controlled Martin Keown's pass near the left touchline, cut back past the 37-year-old Donato and crossed to the far post where Lee Dixon finished with a powerful header. Arsenal went close on several more occasions in an exciting, open start during which Deportivo also showed they could not be underestimated on the counter-attack. Bergkamp showed wonderful technique to control a long Dixon pass on his chest before twisting to send in volley which the Cameroonian goalkeeper Jacques Songo'o scrambled across his line to save. </p> <p>Not long after, two Bergkamp corners further exposed Deportivo's vulnerability in the air. From the first Martin Keown sent a header inches over. Then Henry headed just over. Although David Seaman was briefly called into action to save a long-range free-kick from the Brazilian Flavio in the 25th minute, the home side's second arrived just before the half-hour. </p> <p>Bergkamp sent his compatriot Overmars scampering down the right flank and from Overmars's cross Henry nipped in front of two defend ers to score at the near post. But for two alert saves by Songo'o from Bergkamp, the first at his near post and the second outside his area with his feet, Arsenal would have been out of sight by half-time. </p> <p>It was hard to believe Deportivo were the best team in Spain. There was no doubting their skill in attack, where the Argentine Turu Flores showed flashes of magic on the left flank. But the defence looked shaky every time Arsenal poured forward and within a minute of the start of the second half Overmars had again forced Songo'o into a save. </p> <p>There was bad news for Arsenal in the 52nd minute when Martin Keown was booked for a foul on Turu Flores which means he misses next week's second leg.Then shortly after wards, Deportivo won a penalty. Freddie Ljungberg was adjudged to have fouled Flavio and Djalminha impudently chipped in a penalty which briefly changed the complexion of the tie. </p> <p>Things turned dramatically back in Arsenal's favour in the 65th minute when Djalminha, booked shortly before, was sent off after a clash with Grimandi.

      "bodyText": "Two goals in the last 12 minutes by the substitute Kanu and the outstanding Dennis Bergkamp all but assured Arsenal of a place in the quarter-finals as they overwhelmed the Spanish league leaders Deportivo la Coruna in a display of pace, power and, most importantly, goals. Kanu's strike especially will always live in the memory of the Arsenal faithful. Pouncing on a defensive error he headed the ball clear of the chasing pack of Deportivo's defenders and let it run. With sublime skill, elegance and confidence which verged on arrogance, he just flicked his right foot over the ball twisted his waist and with keeper Songo'o falling on his back the Nigerian walked the ball into the net in what must surely go down as a classic moment in football history. With two touches he covered 30 yards beating defence and goalkeeper and walked the ball in the net. Magic. Arsenal knew victory was essential to give them real hope of progressing to a tie with Parma or Werder Bremen. And Ars\u00e8ne Wenger must have been confident given that Deportivo had travelled as well as Bergkamp in the lead-up to this tie, losing four of the past five away games. With the exception of the suspended Patrick Vieira, the Arsenal manager could choose from a full complement of players. And he surprised everyone by dropping not only Kanu and Ray Parlour to the bench but, most significantly, the captain Tony Adams. Last week Adams said he had been \"kicking butt\" in training. Now he was kicking his heels. The pre-match explanation from Wenger was that the 33-year-old had a \"small physical problem\" after his return from an absence of almost two months at the weekend. The unenviable task of filling Adams's boots fell to the Ukranian Oleg Luzhny. Also drafted in were Gilles Grimandi, Marc Overmars and Thierry Henry, and the pace of the latter two was instrumental to Arsenal's fantastic start. With Bergkamp also in excellent form, Arsenal were irrestible. Playing at a far quicker tempo than Deportivo would have wanted, and passing and moving with purpose, they were two up inside half an hour. The first arrived after only five minutes. Henry, a constant menace with his pace, was the architect. He controlled Martin Keown's pass near the left touchline, cut back past the 37-year-old Donato and crossed to the far post where Lee Dixon finished with a powerful header. Arsenal went close on several more occasions in an exciting, open start during which Deportivo also showed they could not be underestimated on the counter-attack. Bergkamp showed wonderful technique to control a long Dixon pass on his chest before twisting to send in volley which the Cameroonian goalkeeper Jacques Songo'o scrambled across his line to save. Not long after, two Bergkamp corners further exposed Deportivo's vulnerability in the air. From the first Martin Keown sent a header inches over. Then Henry headed just over. Although David Seaman was briefly called into action to save a long-range free-kick from the Brazilian Flavio in the 25th minute, the home side's second arrived just before the half-hour. Bergkamp sent his compatriot Overmars scampering down the right flank and from Overmars's cross Henry nipped in front of two defend ers to score at the near post. But for two alert saves by Songo'o from Bergkamp, the first at his near post and the second outside his area with his feet, Arsenal would have been out of sight by half-time. It was hard to believe Deportivo were the best team in Spain. There was no doubting their skill in attack, where the Argentine Turu Flores showed flashes of magic on the left flank. But the defence looked shaky every time Arsenal poured forward and within a minute of the start of the second half Overmars had again forced Songo'o into a save. There was bad news for Arsenal in the 52nd minute when Martin Keown was booked for a foul on Turu Flores which means he misses next week's second leg.Then shortly after wards, Deportivo won a penalty. Freddie Ljungberg was adjudged to have fouled Flavio and Djalminha impudently chipped in a penalty which briefly changed the complexion of the tie. Things turned dramatically back in Arsenal's favour in the 65th minute when Djalminha, booked shortly before, was sent off after a clash with Grimandi. The Brazilian reacted angrily to a tackle by the Frenchman and, as he got off the ground, appeared to butt Grimandi in the chest. Grimandi. who may have been guilty of over-reacting, was booked as Djalminha received his second yellow card. To Highbury's relief and delight, Arsenal wasted little time in making their numerical advantage count. Emmanuel Petit swung in a left-footed free-kick from the right flank and Henry rose unmarked to head in emphatically at the far post. Arsenal l (4-4-2): Seaman; Dixon, Keown, Luzhny, Silvinho; Overmars, Grimandi, Petit, Ljungberg; Bergkamp, Henry. Deportivo La Coruna ( 4-2-3-1): Songo'o; Manuel Pablo, Donato, Naybet, Romero; Mauro Silva, Jokanovic; Flavio, Djalminha, Turu Flores; Makaay. Referee : A Ouzounov (Bulgaria).",

Although Spain, Belgium, France and Switzerland - who all have outstanding extradition warrants against him - could theoretically have launched last-minute legal challenges to the the decision, none was forthcoming.</p> <p>Baltasar Garzon, the campaigning Spanish judge who has orchestrated international attempts to bring Gen Pinochet to justice, made a final, futile attempt to stop the general leaving Britain, faxing a nine-page request to the crown prosecution service asking for an immediate appeal over Mr Straw's decision.</p> <p>But Spain's foreign minister, Abel Matutes, reiterated the long-held position of the Spanish government that it would not authorise a legal challenge to Mr Straw's decision. The CPS said it could only act on instructions received through official diplomatic channels.</p> <p>Joan Garces, a lawyer for Spanish victims of Gen Pinochet's regime, described Mr Straw's decision as \"a political deal allowing for impunity\".</p> <p>Bernard Bertossa, the Geneva state prosecutor who filed an arrest warrant for the general's arrest, said he was extremely disappointed by the ruling. The Belgian foreign minister, Louis Michel, said the lengthy legal battle served \"to show dictators past and future that history can catch up with them\".</p> <p>The incoming Chilean president, Ricardo Lagos, insisted this week that Gen Pinochet could be put on trial in the country. \"If that were not the case, it would mean that our democracy is castrated,\" he said. But most outside observers expect Gen Pinochet to fade into the political background as he lives out his final days.</p> <p>Defending his decision in the Commons yesterday, moments after the general's plane had taken off, Mr Straw said that throughout the saga he had been keenly aware of the gravity of the crimes committed by Gen Pinochet and of the desire for justice by those who suffered at the hands of the former Chilean regime.</p> <p>But he said: \"The trial of an accused in the condition diagnosed in Senator Pinochet, on the charges which have been made against him in this case, could not be fair in any country, and would violate article six of the European convention on human rights.\"</p> <p>Mr Straw added: \"This case has understandably aroused great debate and feeling, and its impact has been felt worldwide.</p> <p>It has established, beyond question, the principle that those who commit human rights abuses in one country cannot assume that they are safe elsewhere. That will be its lasting legacy.\"</p> <p>In a move that is likely to have far-reaching implications for future extradition cases, Mr Straw announced he intended to publish a consultation paper on options for streamlining extradition procedures in Britain.</p> <p>After the decision Tony Blair told the cabinet that Mr Straw had dealt with the Pinochet affair \"right by the book\".</p> <p>Lady Thatcher, a staunch supporter of Gen Pinochet throughout, said his reward from the government for being a friend of Britain during the Falklands war was \"to be held prisoner for 16 months\".</p>",

      "bodyText": "Augusto Pinochet was due to set foot on Chilean soil this morning for the first time in more than 17 months, bringing to an end any realistic chance of prosecuting the former dictator for crimes against humanity. Last night human rights groups criticised Jack Straw's decision to halt extradition proceedings against the general on medical grounds, but declared that the Pinochet case was the most important precedent for international justice since the Nuremberg trials. Amnesty International, which has been at the heart of attempts to bring Gen Pinochet to justice, said: \"The fact that Augusto Pinochet was arrested - almost unthinkable 17 months ago - has sent a powerful message: no one is above international law, even when national laws offer protection from prosecution.\" The departure of the Chilean airforce jet carrying the 84-year-old general from RAF Waddington in Lincolnshire at 1.15pm yesterday brings to a close one of the most intense legal and political dramas of modern times. The general was informed of the decision that brought the saga to an end at 8am yesterday, when the home office faxed his lawyers with the news that the home secretary had decided not to extradite him. Mr Straw, who has spent the past week considering representations on the medical report that found Gen Pinochet had suffered extensive brain damage as a result of a series of strokes, said nothing had persuaded him to change his original assessment that the general was unfit to stand trial. News of the decision was greeted with derision by those still hoping that the former Chilean dictator would be put on trial, but in Santiago supporters of the general, many of whom had been up since the early hours waiting for the announcement, reacted with joy. As soon as the solicitor general had announced that no charges would be brought against Gen Pinochet in the British courts he was free to go. Although Spain, Belgium, France and Switzerland - who all have outstanding extradition warrants against him - could theoretically have launched last-minute legal challenges to the the decision, none was forthcoming. Baltasar Garzon, the campaigning Spanish judge who has orchestrated international attempts to bring Gen Pinochet to justice, made a final, futile attempt to stop the general leaving Britain, faxing a nine-page request to the crown prosecution service asking for an immediate appeal over Mr Straw's decision. But Spain's foreign minister, Abel Matutes, reiterated the long-held position of the Spanish government that it would not authorise a legal challenge to Mr Straw's decision. The CPS said it could only act on instructions received through official diplomatic channels. Joan Garces, a lawyer for Spanish victims of Gen Pinochet's regime, described Mr Straw's decision as \"a political deal allowing for impunity\". Bernard Bertossa, the Geneva state prosecutor who filed an arrest warrant for the general's arrest, said he was extremely disappointed by the ruling. The Belgian foreign minister, Louis Michel, said the lengthy legal battle served \"to show dictators past and future that history can catch up with them\". The incoming Chilean president, Ricardo Lagos, insisted this week that Gen Pinochet could be put on trial in the country. \"If that were not the case, it would mean that our democracy is castrated,\" he said. But most outside observers expect Gen Pinochet to fade into the political background as he lives out his final days. Defending his decision in the Commons yesterday, moments after the general's plane had taken off, Mr Straw said that throughout the saga he had been keenly aware of the gravity of the crimes committed by Gen Pinochet and of the desire for justice by those who suffered at the hands of the former Chilean regime. But he said: \"The trial of an accused in the condition diagnosed in Senator Pinochet, on the charges which have been made against him in this case, could not be fair in any country, and would violate article six of the European convention on human rights.\" Mr Straw added: \"This case has understandably aroused great debate and feeling, and its impact has been felt worldwide. It has established, beyond question, the principle that those who commit human rights abuses in one country cannot assume that they are safe elsewhere. That will be its lasting legacy.\" In a move that is likely to have far-reaching implications for future extradition cases, Mr Straw announced he intended to publish a consultation paper on options for streamlining extradition procedures in Britain. After the decision Tony Blair told the cabinet that Mr Straw had dealt with the Pinochet affair \"right by the book\". Lady Thatcher, a staunch supporter of Gen Pinochet throughout, said his reward from the government for being a friend of Britain during the Falklands war was \"to be held prisoner for 16 months\".",

      "body": "<p><strong>HUGHES THIS WEEK'S BIG SIGNING?</strong></p> <p>There hasn't been a big money move in the Premiership for a while now. Not since Colin Hendry joined Coventry for ten bob the other week anyway. So praise be to Stephen Hughes, who has just had a change of heart and agreed to join Everton for three - count 'em - million quid!</p> <p>The Arsenal reserves and England under-21 midfielder was on the verge of joining the Toffees earlier this week, but player and club could not agree terms and the deal fell through. However, it appears the 23-year-old has decided it would be rather nice to play a game every now and then, and is expected to put pen to paper in a day or two. \"We are delighted to have reached an agreement,\" said Walter Smith, sounding more like a very bored accountant than the manager of a major football club who has just landed his man, \"and we hope the transfer will be completed early next week.\"</p> <p>It's good news for England as well as Everton - a good prospect was wasting away in Arsenal's reserves. Hughes looked the business when he burst onto the scene with a series of assured displays and a blooter of a goal against Chelsea, but the stifling presence of He Is Emmanuel Petit and Pat Vieira ensured he languished in the reserves. Happily, young Hughes is now free and no longer threatened... hold on, did you just say Everton are reported to be interested in acquiring Rangers midfielder Jorg Albertz? D'oh!</p> <p><strong>WAKE UP, IT'S A BEAUTIFUL MORNING!</strong></p> <p>Got up early for the Manchester United v Liverpool game? Suddenly realised you don't have Sky? Well don't go down the pub to watch it - drinking this early just isn't healthy. Follow the game live from 11.30am on Football Unlimited with a nice glass of orange juice instead.</p> <p><strong>JOHNNY BE PATIENT</strong></p> <p>He may have presided over the worst result in the history of the fifth-best supported club in the world, but his self-confidence is in as good a shape as ever. John Barnes, the most popular man in Inverness, is raring to get back into the management saddle.</p> <p>\"I want to get back in football and if an opportunity comes along I will jump at it,\" said the ex-Celtic boss as he addressed a load of students somewhere in Oxfordshire. \"It's not important what happened at Celtic,\" he unwisely opined, in a quote which will come back to haunt him after it has been printed out of context in the Glasgow press. \"Things like that happen in football. I always look forward not back.\" You're telling us nothing we don't already know, John - you didn't spend much time looking backwards when plotting your defence-lite 1-1-8 formation, did you?</p> <p>However, you can say what you like about Digger, because while his suits are bad, his heart is good. \"I want to go into management again, not to prove anyone wrong but because I want to prove myself right,\" he pleaded without a hint of malice. Mind you, he can afford to be pleasant. When asked if Celtic sent him packing with \u00a31m in his back pocket, Barnes visibly bridled. \"People are saying I got a nice pay-off, but I didn't,\" he insisted. \"I didn't even get half that amount.\" That still qualifies as 'nice' to the Fiver, Johnny boy.</p> <p><strong>QUOTE OF THE DAY</strong></p> <p>\"Villa is by far the most attractive option for Nilis at the moment.\" - PSV striker Luc Nilis' agent Dirk Degraen not in any way making his client sound like the most desperate of desperadoes.</p> <p><strong>PRE-MATCH TENSION</strong></p> <p>It's our pick of the Premiership again. But we're sick of talking about Manchester United, so there's absolutely no way we're mentioning their game this week. What's that you say? They're playing who? Oh for goodness sake...</p> <p>Manchester United v Liverpool<br> The weekend starts with the big one at Old Trafford.

      "bodyText": "HUGHES THIS WEEK'S BIG SIGNING? There hasn't been a big money move in the Premiership for a while now. Not since Colin Hendry joined Coventry for ten bob the other week anyway. So praise be to Stephen Hughes, who has just had a change of heart and agreed to join Everton for three - count 'em - million quid! The Arsenal reserves and England under-21 midfielder was on the verge of joining the Toffees earlier this week, but player and club could not agree terms and the deal fell through. However, it appears the 23-year-old has decided it would be rather nice to play a game every now and then, and is expected to put pen to paper in a day or two. \"We are delighted to have reached an agreement,\" said Walter Smith, sounding more like a very bored accountant than the manager of a major football club who has just landed his man, \"and we hope the transfer will be completed early next week.\" It's good news for England as well as Everton - a good prospect was wasting away in Arsenal's reserves. Hughes looked the business when he burst onto the scene with a series of assured displays and a blooter of a goal against Chelsea, but the stifling presence of He Is Emmanuel Petit and Pat Vieira ensured he languished in the reserves. Happily, young Hughes is now free and no longer threatened... hold on, did you just say Everton are reported to be interested in acquiring Rangers midfielder Jorg Albertz? D'oh! WAKE UP, IT'S A BEAUTIFUL MORNING! Got up early for the Manchester United v Liverpool game? Suddenly realised you don't have Sky? Well don't go down the pub to watch it - drinking this early just isn't healthy. Follow the game live from 11.30am on Football Unlimited with a nice glass of orange juice instead. JOHNNY BE PATIENT He may have presided over the worst result in the history of the fifth-best supported club in the world, but his self-confidence is in as good a shape as ever. John Barnes, the most popular man in Inverness, is raring to get back into the management saddle. \"I want to get back in football and if an opportunity comes along I will jump at it,\" said the ex-Celtic boss as he addressed a load of students somewhere in Oxfordshire. \"It's not important what happened at Celtic,\" he unwisely opined, in a quote which will come back to haunt him after it has been printed out of context in the Glasgow press. \"Things like that happen in football. I always look forward not back.\" You're telling us nothing we don't already know, John - you didn't spend much time looking backwards when plotting your defence-lite 1-1-8 formation, did you? However, you can say what you like about Digger, because while his suits are bad, his heart is good. \"I want to go into management again, not to prove anyone wrong but because I want to prove myself right,\" he pleaded without a hint of malice. Mind you, he can afford to be pleasant. When asked if Celtic sent him packing with \u00a31m in his back pocket, Barnes visibly bridled. \"People are saying I got a nice pay-off, but I didn't,\" he insisted. \"I didn't even get half that amount.\" That still qualifies as 'nice' to the Fiver, Johnny boy. QUOTE OF THE DAY \"Villa is by far the most attractive option for Nilis at the moment.\" - PSV striker Luc Nilis' agent Dirk Degraen not in any way making his client sound like the most desperate of desperadoes. PRE-MATCH TENSION It's our pick of the Premiership again. But we're sick of talking about Manchester United, so there's absolutely no way we're mentioning their game this week. What's that you say? They're playing who? Oh for goodness sake... Manchester United v Liverpool The weekend starts with the big one at Old Trafford. United have a major worry concerning Royston Keane - a dodgy hamstring could keep him out, so who'll bully the ref now? Paul Scholes could also be missing, so David Beckham may be moved into the centre - at least he won't make the papers if they put him there. Liverpool look for their first victory on United's peeling turf for ten years, and with that in mind recall Michael Owen, who should pull up with hamstring problems on the half-hour.

Bradford also have a striker surplus: Deans Saunders and Windass are likely to start but Lee Mills and Jorge Cadete will be chomping and sitting at bit and on bench respectively. Leeds v Coventry (Sunday) A must-win game for Leeds if Man U aren't going to race (even further) away with the Premiership. Michael Bridges still has a bit of ankle knack and may drop to the bench to allow Darren Huckerby to receive the ball and run it into touch again and again. Matthew Jones and Harry Kewell are also slight doubts for David O'Leary O'Leeds.

Problems, problems. THE RUMOUR MILL Patrick Vieira is being chased by Internazionale. But the French star is happy in North London and Inter may be forced to \"settle\" for Barcelona's Josep Guardiola instead. NEWS IN BRIEF Sir Stanley Matthews' funeral took place in Stoke today. Thousands of mourners stood silently outside St Peter's Church as the service was relayed to them via loudspeakers. Footballers through the generations, from Sir Tom Finney to Steven Gerrard, turned out to pay their respects. BSkyB have paid \u00a340m to take a 9.9% shareholding in Chelsea. Sky Sports Ventures, a subsidiary of BSkyB, will act as the exclusive media agent for Chelsea Village Group. Gilles Grimandi could be in trouble with Uefa after admitting he overreacted during a spat with Deportivo's Brazilian star Djalminha in last night's Uefa Cup clash. Djalminha faces a lengthy ban after being accused of spitting at the Bulgarian referee who sent him off.

O'Leary claims he waited outside his team's dressing room for 25 minutes for a Roma official to collect him and take him to the conference, but no one arrived.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>It was certainly a season of surprises. Comme des Gar\u00e7ons went punk: instead of showing in silence, it was Sneaker Pimps on the stereo and shrunken tartan jackets with Rei Kawakubo's now trademark (and much copied) bunched-up rosettes cascading over the collars and shoulders. Black-and-white layers of tulle sprouted from underneath mini-kilts in what was an aggressive, energetic collection full of zips, buckles and 70s Carnaby Street chic. </p> <p>Where would designers be this season without the fertile plundering ground that is London street style? \"There is nothing safe in this world,\" sang Billy Idol at the Ungaro show, and indeed he was right. Red leather blousons, tie-dye jeans and punky, studded T-shirts from the designer who dresses society ladies? Whatever next? Even Christian Lacroix, king of the ballgown, seemed to take his inspiration from Human League album covers, sending models out in drainpipe jeans, red stilettos and sequinned T-shirts, hair tied with giant bows. </p> <p>By contrast, Valentino stuck with what he knows best: how to dress ladies. Pastel suits, cashmere jumpers and slithery eveningwear looked timeless and refreshing amid all the studded chaos. As did Dries Van Noten - a gorgeous show of chunky knits, stiff, patterned skirts, fur-trimmed coats and long, sweeping scarves. Plenty to wear here, and extra points for avoiding the retro trap. Gaultier, too, called his own tune. Trenchcoats, fedoras and mufflers made the models look like sleek private detectives, although we're not sure about the return of the stirrup legging. Knitwear was strong, as were accessories such as elbow-length leather gloves and thin clutch bags. </p> <p>Something has been troubling me. Brand identity. What is it? How does a design house take its brand through to the 21st century? What makes a label sell: its name or the person behind it? If a designer dies or moves on, though, they find another one to carry on the name. The new designer might have a completely different style, but that doesn't matter because the brand is established enough to withstand the change. People will buy it regardless. Isn't that a funny concept? </p> <p>Martin Margiela for Herm\u00e8s adheres to the brand's equestrian roots: fluid cashmere duffles with leather fastenings, soft fur gilets, cropped leather gloves and flat riding boots. Burnt orange, navy, cream and black are the colours of Margiela's stealth wealth. Will anyone under 40 buy it? Perhaps not, but they will buy the Herm\u00e8s trainers, which they'll wear with their Louis Vuitton bags. </p> <p> Marc Jacobs is a far more irreverent designer: he cuts up the traditional LV monogram and makes it into sequins. Magnifique! Black leather wraparound skirts worn over cashmere leggings, slouchy petrol-blue jumpers that fell off the shoulder and jaunty black berets were all very 80s, as were drop-waisted dresses and baggy blouson jackets fastened with thick buckles and straps. A little bit bondage, a little bit retro. As for bags - ditch this season's shiny patent number. For autumn, your Louis Vuitton sac comes swinging on a chain with the LV picked out in studs. </p> <p>So Vuitton has bags, Herm\u00e8s has trainers . . . Chloe has sunglasses, if the success of last season's lunettes is anything to go by. Stella McCartney is always careful to integrate a wisp or two of Chloe's original spirit into her collection: it appears in chiffon blouses with beaded yokes and in the soft greens and lilacs of her colour palate. This was a strong collection that took as its inspiration nothing more complicated than Stella and her friends. It's what they wear to the pub: pieces culled from boyfriends and Bali and thrown on with typical rich-girl confidence. Cream canvas coats came with raw hems and shaggy fake fur lining, airy batwing blouses were accessorised with pretty African clasps, and jeans - the things that will sell - were drainpipe and emblazoned with a Chloe eagle motif on the bum. </p> <p> John Galliano pitched his Dior collection at rich American rappers and all those who want to dress like them. Fur boots, crocodile leather skirts, ostrich skin coats, monogrammed trenches, CD buckles and necklaces had all the subtlety of Lil Kim at the VH1 Awards, but they were artfully cut and sure to find a market in today's climate of ghetto fabulousness. </p> <p>What does Givenchy have that really rakes in the bucks? A cosmetics line and a loyal clientele - who might just find this season's punk aesthetic a little difficult. They should persevere, though. Mohair minidresses, stripy pelmet skirts and leather catsuits apart, there were easy tuxedo jackets and high-necked silk blouses, as well as gorgeous shoes in olive, purple or black with sexy silver ankle chains. </p> <p>Yves Saint Laurent has Tom Ford, fashion's A-bomb. Poor Alber Elbaz is no more, despite sending out a collection that was vintage YSL reworked for 2000. Toffee-brown leather trenches, boxy pinstripe jackets and floaty chiffon dresses all came belted at the waist and topped with a fedora or tailed with wrinkly leather boots. </p> <p>Fashion: it eats you up and spits you out. Today's brands are mercilessly consummate. Bald? Fat? Short? Spotty? Better send a body double to take your bows, or stay behind a screen. Design houses can take no risks with the message they put out. To be commercial, you have to be credible first. Sadly for some, it takes more than a shifty round the streets of London and a Clash/ Blondie/Death In Vegas soundtrack to achieve this. You can only fool some of the people some of the time.</p>",

      "bodyText": "It was certainly a season of surprises. Comme des Gar\u00e7ons went punk: instead of showing in silence, it was Sneaker Pimps on the stereo and shrunken tartan jackets with Rei Kawakubo's now trademark (and much copied) bunched-up rosettes cascading over the collars and shoulders. Black-and-white layers of tulle sprouted from underneath mini-kilts in what was an aggressive, energetic collection full of zips, buckles and 70s Carnaby Street chic. Where would designers be this season without the fertile plundering ground that is London street style? \"There is nothing safe in this world,\" sang Billy Idol at the Ungaro show, and indeed he was right. Red leather blousons, tie-dye jeans and punky, studded T-shirts from the designer who dresses society ladies? Whatever next? Even Christian Lacroix, king of the ballgown, seemed to take his inspiration from Human League album covers, sending models out in drainpipe jeans, red stilettos and sequinned T-shirts, hair tied with giant bows. By contrast, Valentino stuck with what he knows best: how to dress ladies. Pastel suits, cashmere jumpers and slithery eveningwear looked timeless and refreshing amid all the studded chaos. As did Dries Van Noten - a gorgeous show of chunky knits, stiff, patterned skirts, fur-trimmed coats and long, sweeping scarves. Plenty to wear here, and extra points for avoiding the retro trap. Gaultier, too, called his own tune. Trenchcoats, fedoras and mufflers made the models look like sleek private detectives, although we're not sure about the return of the stirrup legging. Knitwear was strong, as were accessories such as elbow-length leather gloves and thin clutch bags. Something has been troubling me. Brand identity. What is it? How does a design house take its brand through to the 21st century? What makes a label sell: its name or the person behind it? If a designer dies or moves on, though, they find another one to carry on the name. The new designer might have a completely different style, but that doesn't matter because the brand is established enough to withstand the change. People will buy it regardless. Isn't that a funny concept? Martin Margiela for Herm\u00e8s adheres to the brand's equestrian roots: fluid cashmere duffles with leather fastenings, soft fur gilets, cropped leather gloves and flat riding boots. Burnt orange, navy, cream and black are the colours of Margiela's stealth wealth. Will anyone under 40 buy it? Perhaps not, but they will buy the Herm\u00e8s trainers, which they'll wear with their Louis Vuitton bags. Marc Jacobs is a far more irreverent designer: he cuts up the traditional LV monogram and makes it into sequins. Magnifique! Black leather wraparound skirts worn over cashmere leggings, slouchy petrol-blue jumpers that fell off the shoulder and jaunty black berets were all very 80s, as were drop-waisted dresses and baggy blouson jackets fastened with thick buckles and straps. A little bit bondage, a little bit retro. As for bags - ditch this season's shiny patent number. For autumn, your Louis Vuitton sac comes swinging on a chain with the LV picked out in studs. So Vuitton has bags, Herm\u00e8s has trainers . . . Chloe has sunglasses, if the success of last season's lunettes is anything to go by. Stella McCartney is always careful to integrate a wisp or two of Chloe's original spirit into her collection: it appears in chiffon blouses with beaded yokes and in the soft greens and lilacs of her colour palate. This was a strong collection that took as its inspiration nothing more complicated than Stella and her friends. It's what they wear to the pub: pieces culled from boyfriends and Bali and thrown on with typical rich-girl confidence. Cream canvas coats came with raw hems and shaggy fake fur lining, airy batwing blouses were accessorised with pretty African clasps, and jeans - the things that will sell - were drainpipe and emblazoned with a Chloe eagle motif on the bum. John Galliano pitched his Dior collection at rich American rappers and all those who want to dress like them. Fur boots, crocodile leather skirts, ostrich skin coats, monogrammed trenches, CD buckles and necklaces had all the subtlety of Lil Kim at the VH1 Awards, but they were artfully cut and sure to find a market in today's climate of ghetto fabulousness. What does Givenchy have that really rakes in the bucks? A cosmetics line and a loyal clientele - who might just find this season's punk aesthetic a little difficult. They should persevere, though. Mohair minidresses, stripy pelmet skirts and leather catsuits apart, there were easy tuxedo jackets and high-necked silk blouses, as well as gorgeous shoes in olive, purple or black with sexy silver ankle chains. Yves Saint Laurent has Tom Ford, fashion's A-bomb. Poor Alber Elbaz is no more, despite sending out a collection that was vintage YSL reworked for 2000. Toffee-brown leather trenches, boxy pinstripe jackets and floaty chiffon dresses all came belted at the waist and topped with a fedora or tailed with wrinkly leather boots. Fashion: it eats you up and spits you out. Today's brands are mercilessly consummate. Bald? Fat? Short? Spotty? Better send a body double to take your bows, or stay behind a screen. Design houses can take no risks with the message they put out. To be commercial, you have to be credible first. Sadly for some, it takes more than a shifty round the streets of London and a Clash/ Blondie/Death In Vegas soundtrack to achieve this. You can only fool some of the people some of the time.",

      "body": "<p>Right now, Paris is enjoying what fashion people call a \"moment\". After a spell of watching from the sidelines, unamused and tight-lipped as a Victorian governess, while the eccentrics, show-offs and flirts of London, New York and Milan stole the fashion limelight, Paris is back on the sunny side of the street. Not only did this Paris Fashion Week boast a celebrity turnout that easily rivalled Milan's, but the audience, plastered in the city's evergreen monograms of Louis Vuitton's LV and Christian Dior's CD, looked as lovestruck as teenagers at a Ricky Martin concert. </p> <p>The spring in Paris's step is largely due to the installation of new, ambitious young designers in the city's most prestigious ateliers. Christian Dior, Givenchy and Hermes have been given edge by John Galliano, Alexander McQueen and Martin Margiela. Louis Vuitton and Celine have reclaimed the cachet of a greed-is-good heritage under Marc Jacobs and Michael Kors, while Chloe has found modernity and sex appeal under Stella McCartney. But Galliano, McQueen and McCartney are British, Jacobs and Kors are American, Margiela is Belgian. For all the new blood in town, there has been little sign of French talent finding the spotlight. </p> <p>Gilles Rosier has just bucked that trend. Long regarded as one of France's most promising design talents, yesterday he presented his first collection as womenswear designer for the 30-year-old house of Kenzo. But then Kenzo is hardly your average Parisian label - founder, Kenzo Takada, was one of the first Japanese designers to arrive on the Paris scene, launching his first collection in 1970. Ahead of his time as a designer, Kenzo was experimenting with ethnic influences long before it became commonplace to do so, and his freeform approach to mixing colour and print gained him almost instant attention and acclaim. By the time he retired last year, naming Rosier as his successor, Kenzo had more than 100 stores worldwide, and one of the most recognisable images in fashion. </p> <p>Two days before Rosier's first show for Kenzo, and the Place Vendome workshop simmers just below panic level. The cast of models has not yet been finalised: those who have been booked are fitted, preened and polaroided by swarms of assistants and stylists who buzz about, while other tripping hopeful girls chat into their mobiles or coo to their dogs while they wait to be seen. Thirty hours earlier, Rosier was over in the Rue des Victoire presenting his own-name show, an accomplished affair with lean, beautiful tailoring pepped up with hard-edged leather and graphic patterns. All in all, he hasn't been getting much sleep recently, but in the midst of his colourfully-dressed assistants, Rosier, an unassuming figure in taupe carpenter trousers and cotton jumper, is totally alert and focused. If he was American, he'd be psyched. </p> <p>Rosier, who will be 40 this year, is no newcomer to Paris fashion. Before launching a label under his own name eight years ago, he worked at Pierre Balmain and Christian Dior, and became assistant to Jean Paul Gaultier. He is happy with his first designs for Kenzo, he says, although he's \"too exhausted to enjoy it now\". There is an unmistakable Kenzo flavour to this collection, in the mixing of ethnic influences, strong colours and patterns: a kilt moves to reveal floral print between the pleats, a coat fastened just above the natural waist with a wraparound tie has a kimono feel to it, a floral-print is carefully layered on a whole outfit for a trompe l'oeil effect. \"It's about mixing. The meeting of tribes, the mixing of rustic and precious fabrics. This is the code of Kenzo,\" explains Rosier. </p> <p>Rosier is well aware of the importance of the Japanese heritage, not just within Kenzo but throughout Paris. \"The Japanese designers changed Paris so much. I've been observing fashion for a long time, and when I was young the French - especially the Parisians - were very conservative; lots of dark colours, lots of grey. Kenzo had a new way of thinking that was always about the meeting of east and west. \"I love that dynamic.\" Too sharp to pore over the founder's archives too slavishly - \"It wouldn't be fair to him to copy what he already did\" - Rosier wants to explore the east-meets-west theme, \"but not to labour the ethnic influence. It's been used too much by people with no talent who don't understand it.\" </p> <p>Although he had worked at Kenzo on a freelance basis for three seasons when the designer retired, Rosier was surprised when he was offered the job. \"I didn't expect it because a lot of French companies these days look outside for designers. A long time ago, there was a tradition of an assistant working their way up, but in the past decade that has hardly happened in Paris at all. In Paris, it's too much about getting a big name, and not enough about supporting an industry.\" </p> <p>It is an irony not lost on Rosier that it took a Japanese-founded Paris label to give a lesser-known French designer a chance. </p> <p>Rosier is faced with the challenge of holding his own at a label strongly identified with one man's vision. It is a vision Rosier can identify with, luckily. \"Kenzo was the first fashion designer who really seized on the idea of the melting pot as a humanitarian ideal. I have so much respect for that.\" </p> <p>Rosier admires people with a strong individual style - John Malkovich, for instance - rather than fashion plates; and like Kenzo, takes a zealous interest in the dynamics surrounding him: for the past 12 years he has lived in the Bastille area (by coincidence, around the corner from Kenzo himself) which he loves for its \"mix of old Paris and new Paris\". Despite his workload, Rosier remains unabsorbed by the fashion world. When asked if he socialises much with fashion people, he looks utterly horrified: \"No no no! That would be too boring.\" </p> <p>But although Kenzo is still expanding, with a new perfume (called Time for Peace) just launched and a flagship store set to open in New York's SoHo this spring, Rosier is well aware that the brand needs to attract a new generation. This requires equal parts reinvention and reaffirmation. \"Because I know that Kenzo wanted me to do something new, I am free to interpret the heritage in a modern way. It's a good time, because colour and print are coming back into fashion just now. So, lucky me.\"</p>",

      "body": "<p> I have also compiled a computer 'corpus' of New Labour texts (as well as a smaller one of earlier Labour texts for comparison), which can be searched to give all instances of particular words or phrases.</p> <p> The New Labour corpus includes much of the material listed under Sources, but also additional material (e.g. extra speeches of Blair's). On the basis of a comparison between the New Labour and earlier Labour material, as well as a comparison of New Labour with larger, more general corpora of contemporary English, it is possible to identify 'keywords' of New Labour, words that occur relatively most frequently. The strongest New Labour keywords on the basis of this comparison are: </p> <p>we <br> Britain <br> welfare <br> partnership <br> new <br> schools <br> people <br> crime <br> reform <br> deliver <br> promote <br> business <br> deal <br> tough <br> young<br></p> <p> I shall periodically insert into the text a summary of information from the corpus about one or more New Labour 'keywords'. I shall begin here with 'new' and related words.</p> <p> 'New' occurs 609 times in 53 speeches of Tony Blair's between 1997 and 1999 (for comparison, 'modern' occurs 89 times, 'modernise/modernisation' 87 times, and 'reform' 143 times). The most frequent collocations [co-occurances between words in a text] are 'New Labour' (72 instances) and 'New Deal' (70 instances). The sense of political renewal conveyed by 'New Labour' is also evident in references to a 'new politics' (4 instances) and a 'new centre and centre-left' (2 instances). Political renewal is linked to national renewal in the slogan 'New Labour, New Britain', first used at the 1994 Labour Party conference. 'New Britain' is quite frequent (15 examples), and 'new' is also applied (7 times) to other international entities that Britain belongs to (e.g. 'New Europe', 'New Commonwealth'), and even the world (6 instances, e.g. the 'new world we are helping to bring into being'). Political and national renewal are linked to the 'new times' we live in \u00dc 34 instances, including also 'new era' and 'new millennium'.

Another prominent set of meanings relates to ideas and attitudes (36 instances in all, including 'new ideas' (7 instances) 'new confidence' (4 instances), 'new sense of hope (or purpose, or urgency)' (5 instances), and there are 20 expres- sions referring to 'new opportunities' or 'new challenges').

It is perhaps 'modernise' that tends to be used more indiscriminately: 'modernisation' applies to the Labour Party, Britain, the Constitution, the Health Service, education and schools, the welfare state, defence, the Common Agricultural Policy, etc. In 25 cases 'modernisation' (or in a few cases 'modernise') is used in a general way without reference to a specific domain (e.g. 'money for modernisation' (the phrase occurs 3 times), or 'it is moderni-sation for a purpose' (5 instances)). </p> <p>A striking contrast between 'modernisation' and 'reform' is that the former is overwhelmingly used with reference to the UK, whereas the latter is roughly equally used with reference to the EU.

By contrast, 'modernise' occurs only once with 'markets' as its object (and then the reference is to the EU) and once with 'the economy' as its object. So, economic change is 'reform' not 'modernisation', and it applies only at EU level, not in Britain. The only changes in Britain that are referred to as 'reforms' more frequently than 'modernisations' are 'welfare reform' and 'reform of the House of Lords'.

      "bodyText": "I have also compiled a computer 'corpus' of New Labour texts (as well as a smaller one of earlier Labour texts for comparison), which can be searched to give all instances of particular words or phrases. The New Labour corpus includes much of the material listed under Sources, but also additional material (e.g. extra speeches of Blair's). On the basis of a comparison between the New Labour and earlier Labour material, as well as a comparison of New Labour with larger, more general corpora of contemporary English, it is possible to identify 'keywords' of New Labour, words that occur relatively most frequently. The strongest New Labour keywords on the basis of this comparison are: we Britain welfare partnership new schools people crime reform deliver promote business deal tough young I shall periodically insert into the text a summary of information from the corpus about one or more New Labour 'keywords'. I shall begin here with 'new' and related words. 'New' occurs 609 times in 53 speeches of Tony Blair's between 1997 and 1999 (for comparison, 'modern' occurs 89 times, 'modernise/modernisation' 87 times, and 'reform' 143 times). The most frequent collocations [co-occurances between words in a text] are 'New Labour' (72 instances) and 'New Deal' (70 instances). The sense of political renewal conveyed by 'New Labour' is also evident in references to a 'new politics' (4 instances) and a 'new centre and centre-left' (2 instances). Political renewal is linked to national renewal in the slogan 'New Labour, New Britain', first used at the 1994 Labour Party conference. 'New Britain' is quite frequent (15 examples), and 'new' is also applied (7 times) to other international entities that Britain belongs to (e.g. 'New Europe', 'New Commonwealth'), and even the world (6 instances, e.g. the 'new world we are helping to bring into being'). Political and national renewal are linked to the 'new times' we live in \u00dc 34 instances, including also 'new era' and 'new millennium'. And there is a striking number of expressions (41 instances in all) for 'new ways of working' in government (that phrase occurs 8 times, 'new ways' 15 times, and 'new approaches' 11 times) and new relationships asso-ciated with them ('new partnership(s)' occurs 13 times). Another prominent set of meanings relates to ideas and attitudes (36 instances in all, including 'new ideas' (7 instances) 'new confidence' (4 instances), 'new sense of hope (or purpose, or urgency)' (5 instances), and there are 20 expres- sions referring to 'new opportunities' or 'new challenges'). Many 'new' Government initiatives are referred to (57 instances in all), such as the 'new active Community Unit', or a 'new National College for School Leadership', though unlike the 'New Deal' the adjective 'new' is not part of the title. Despite the impression picked up by satirists that 'new' applies to everything and anything ('New Labour, new underwear'), it is used quite selectively for national, political, and governmental renewal in 'new times' which generate new opportunities and challenges and call for new approaches, ideas, and attitudes. It is perhaps 'modernise' that tends to be used more indiscriminately: 'modernisation' applies to the Labour Party, Britain, the Constitution, the Health Service, education and schools, the welfare state, defence, the Common Agricultural Policy, etc. In 25 cases 'modernisation' (or in a few cases 'modernise') is used in a general way without reference to a specific domain (e.g. 'money for modernisation' (the phrase occurs 3 times), or 'it is moderni-sation for a purpose' (5 instances)). A striking contrast between 'modernisation' and 'reform' is that the former is overwhelmingly used with reference to the UK, whereas the latter is roughly equally used with reference to the EU. There is also a striking difference in terms of what is 'reformed' as opposed to 'modernised': the collocation 'economic reform' occurs 11 times, and 'reform' occurs 12 times with 'markets' ('labour', 'capital', or 'product') as its object, always with reference to the EU.

      "body": "<p>Tony Blair's style has been immensely successful. Perhaps the clearest example before the NATO war against Yugoslavia was his widely acclaimed success in 'capturing the popular mood' after Princess Diana's death in the autumn of 1997. Here is the beginning of the short statement he made on that occasion: </p> <p>I feel like everyone else in the country today - utterly devastated. Our thoughts and prayers are with Princess Diana's family - in particular her two sons, two boys - our hearts go out to them. We are today a nation, in Britain, in a state of shock, in mourning, in grief that is so deeply painful for us. </p> <p>Why were these words so effective in 'striking a chord' with many people? One important point is that it was not just his words but his overall bodily performance, the way he looked and acted, as well as what he said. But the language was an important factor. Notice in particular that it is a mixed language. There are two threads running through it. Let me 'extract' one of them: </p> <p>Our thoughts and prayers are with Princess Diana's family, in particular her two sons, our hearts go out to them. We are today a nation in mourning. </p> <p>This is the conventional sort of language that leaders use to speak on behalf of the nation on such occasions. Blair uses the first person plural ('we'), and predictable, pre-constructed expressions (cliches) - 'thoughts and prayers', 'our hearts go out to them', 'a nation in mourning' (once you hear 'our hearts' for instance on this sort of occasion, you can predict 'go out'). But threaded into this conventional public language is a more personal language (Blair begins speaking for himself, in the first person singular, and about his own feelings) and a more vernacular language. It is as if Blair (with his advisers - the speech has been attributed to Alistair Campbell) had started with the official form of words, then personalised and informalised it. He uses a vernacular language of affect as well as a public one - 'utterly devastated', 'in a state of shock'. Notice also the way he rewords 'her two sons' as 'two boys', which again is a shift between a more formal way of referring to them in terms of their relationship to Diana and a more intimate, family way. Blair says he feels 'like everyone else' - he is not only speaking formally for 'the nation', he is also speaking informally for ordinary people; and part of the power of his style is his ability to combine formality and informality, ceremony and feeling, publicness and privateness. </p> <p>A crucial part of the success and apparent continuing popularity of Blair's style is his capacity to, as it were, 'anchor' the public politician in the 'normal person' - the necessary posturing and evasions of politics are it seems at least partially redeemed by Blair's capacity to reassert constantly his normal, decent, likeable personality. In his speeches and interviews there is always a mix between the vernacular language of the normal person and the public language of politics. The sort of 'normal person' that comes across is very much 'middle-class' and 'middle-England' in values, outlook and style. Blair's communicative style embodies the 'new politics' of the 'Third Way' in this respect, as also in the way he has learnt how to be 'tough' and how to assert moral authority in the way he speaks. </p> <p>But Blair's leadership personality and style are not pre-given, they are carefully constructed. For instance, according to Gould, New Labour learnt the political advantage it could gain from being 'tough' and talking about being 'tough' (including using the word so often) from research on focus groups - Blair's 'toughness' has been self-consciously built into his communicative style as a matter of policy and strategy. Blair's apparent and claimed preference for acting on the basis of his political 'instincts' is at odds with the careful calculation of effects on 'public opinion' which goes into every move that he and New Labour make. Blair is, according to his biographer Rentoul, an accomplished showman, an actor. Of course, the circumstances of contemporary politics are not of his making - all politicians have to act, to pretend, or to put it more harshly (though not unfairly) to 'live a lie'. </p> <p>But individual leaders can respond to those circumstances in various ways - by trying to be more accomplished at pretending than others, or by doing what they can to change the circumstances. Perhaps the charitable view of Blair is that it is not yet clear which he will do, but the fear must be that his is a particularly accomplished show. Certainly, there is some evidence that the claims, which his communicative style implicitly makes, about the way he relates to others are at odds with the way he actually relates to them - stories about Blair as a 'power freak' in the managing of the Government (including the Cabinet), the parliamentary Labour Party, and the Labour Party overall, are at odds with the polite, cooperative, open and relaxed personality conveyed in his communicative style. In this sense, leadership styles can 'lie'. Tony Blair may stand for New Labour in the popular imagination, but New Labour is in fact a rather disparate alliance of different political positions associated with different communicative styles (that of his deputy, John Prescott, for example). Although the emphasis in this book will be on Blair, it is important not to lose sight of these differences. Another important issue to keep in focus is how distinctive New Labour is, both from its predecessors in Britain and from similar political positions in other countries. This is relevant to questions of rhetorical style, as well as to the other two aspects of the language of New Labour I shall be dealing with \u00ca what similarities, for instance, are there between Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair, or Bill Clinton and Tony Blair?

      "body": "<p>\"Why did they ban Chocolate Orange?\" Ali G's stern question last year to James Ferman, the former British film censor, epitomises the alienated, semi-informed bemusement of an entire generation. In 1973, the late Stanley Kubrick instructed Warner Bros to withdraw from UK distribution his extraordinary, flawed masterpiece A Clockwork Orange, based on the Anthony Burgess novel. That remarkable act of selective self-suppression has meant that almost no one under the age of 44 has seen it in this country. And now, for the first time in 27 years, A Clockwork Orange is back on British cinema screens. We can all see for ourselves what the fuss has been about. </p> <p>For decades, Kubrick's explicit and brilliantly scabrous fable of \"ultra-violence\" has existed only as a fascinating rumour. It has been a spectral, residual influence here, surfacing in strange, analogous forms. From the Sex Pistols, Bowie and Julien Temple to the Gooners and the Inter-City Firm, the film has persisted in making its shadowy inscriptions on our collective unconscious. Kubrick's diktat was taken very seriously by Warner Bros - what modern commercial auteur could hope now for that level of unquestioning corporate support? - and policed so vigorously that no video copies could legitimately be sold or viewed here; a screening at the (now defunct) Scala cinema in north London in 1993 led to prosecution. </p> <p>For years, British fans of Kubrick were forced to watch A Clockwork Orange on grainy, exhausted prints at fleapit cinemas in Paris, Amsterdam and New York. It is only quite recently, with the growth of global internet retail, and the availability of a new generation of \"multi-regional\" DVD player, that we have been able to import the American DVD edition from amazon.com, albeit at the risk of confiscation by customs and excise. </p> <p>As of next Friday, all this will recede into the legendary past. With it will go the strange dual reality for A Clockwork Orange: it has never been a \"lost\" or samizdat movie such as, say, Jerry Lewis's The Day the Clown Cried, being so freely available everywhere but here. So as a cinematic text, it has had a status at once marginal and canonical. However, there remains its strange position in the history of censorship. Was Kubrick effectively the victim of censorship, or its most notorious and autocratic perpetrator? </p> <p>Without question, his film appeared to have been the inspiration for horrifying acts of rape and murder. Copycat delinquents and wannabe yobbos swaggered around London's west end and football terraces in bowlers and eyeliner, and these incidents were gloatingly magnified on the news pages and shrilly denounced in the leader columns. Outspoken judges hammered Kubrick's film, and home secretary Reginald Maudling solemnly requested a private screening. </p> <p>Certainly, its reception as a film was very different from the purely literary reception Burgess had experienced when the book came out 10 years earlier, in 1962 - part of the huge frenzy of work Burgess embarked on when he thought (wrongly) that he was dying of an inoperable brain tumour. It seemed at this stage to belong to a more cerebral and muted tradition of satire and dystopia: the worlds of Swift, Orwell or Huxley. Provocative, yes, splenetic, certainly, but not incendiary, not an incitement to riot. </p> <p>The book had no very great circulation until the film version appeared, based, to Burgess's considerable chagrin, on the American edition, which had excised a final, emollient chapter showing the older Alex appearing to repudiate violence. As a film, its context was quite different. It seemed to belong to a newer, 70s cinematic movement, along with Peckinpah's Straw Dogs and Jewison's Rollerball - sleeker, sexier, more troubling in their amoral violence. Kubrick himself could not or would not justify his film, so the job fell to Burgess; the worldly, well-travelled writer was a natural media performer, and one who was aware that he owed fame and fortune to Kubrick. </p> <p>Only when Burgess was wheeled out did the general public become widely aware of the inspiration for the original text: an assault by four army deserters on his pregnant wife in 1944, an appalling event which he had creatively merged both with the Teds-and-Rockers clashes he witnessed on returning to 60s Britain after many years abroad, and the teenage hooliganism he and his wife had seen on holiday in Russia in 1961. This terrible personal history became a vital part of the Clockwork Orange myth. Burgess now assumed an unquestioned moral authority to speak in the film's defence, for had he and his wife not suffered directly as a result of precisely this sort of violence? </p> <p>But, for all this, it was never banned. The film's commercial run ended; the moral panic subsided and the unspoken consensus seemed to be that there was no increase in the quantum of crime. Put baldly, the rapists and criminals were doing what they would have done anyway, except with funny make-up. It was only in 1979, when the NFT was unable to screen it for a Kubrick retrospective, that anyone realised what the director had done. Infuriatingly, Kubrick never favoured his audience with a clear explanation, leaving anti-censorship liberals like me unsure whether to revere him or not. </p> <p>It may be that, with the magnificent self-belief of the artist, and displeased with a British establishment that had misrepresented a serious work of art, he was exercising his prerogative of deciding who gets to see his film and where. Perhaps he was sick and tired of being made the scapegoat for society's violence, or was understandably scared by (rumoured) death threats against his family. But withdrawing his film also looks, then as now, like a monumental loss of nerve, and a catastrophic concession to the pro-censorship lobby. Removing it from distribution here and nowhere else, and, moreover, appearing to retreat to the secrecy of his Hertfordshire hideaway, was arguably a pusillanimous abnegation of responsibility. </p> <p>Why was it all right for the rest of the world to experience the socio-cultural consequences of A Clockwork Orange - whatever they may be - and not the United Kingdom, where Kubrick happened to live? Did the director believe his film really was dangerous? The only answers are to be found in the film itself, which anticipates in the most extraordinary way the whole question of censorship, screen violence, the imposition of power by the judiciary and media as the agents of the state - all the questions in which Kubrick and his most famous film have been entangled for nearly 30 years. </p> <p>Seeing this remarkable and very British film for the first time is an exhilarating and disturbing experience. So far from being dated, it seems, in many respects, breathtakingly in advance of almost anything else around in its torsions and its longueurs, its magnificent coups du cin\u00e9ma, its narrative scope and sweep, and its moments of sheer, bizarre offensiveness \"intentional and unintentional\". </p> <p>A Clockwork Orange deserves to be called a work of raddled genius, if anything does, with all that the word implies of dysfunction, waywardness and dazzling, delirious insight. It is like seeing a mixture of Jacobean revenge drama, 18th-century picaresque novel, sci-fi porn and horror comic. Only in its quaint and questionable approach to women and rape is Clockwork Orange a let-down - of which, more in a moment. From the very first shot, of the charismatic tearaway Alex (Malcolm McDowell) smirking at the camera, we are immersed in the disquieting tale of the leader of a menacing gang of costumed \"droogs\". </p> <p>They speak in \"nadsat\", Burgess's quasi-Joycean experimental youth patois, a hybrid of English, Latin and Russian, a literary and linguistic adventure that already puts this picture in an IQ league miles above everything else. They dress in fetishistic costumes and make-up, and stage sadistic beatings and sexual assaults. Alex is finally arrested and subjected to grotesque psychological experiments. </p> <p>The shock of recognition is what hits you first. Is that a cherubic young Warren Clarke as Alex's mutinous sidekick Dim? Is that a sideburned Steven Berkoff as a thuggish police sergeant? Can that possibly be Michael Bates as the shriekingly malevolent prison guard - an actor that my thirtysomething generation remembers solely as the blacked-up punkah-wallah in the 70s sitcom It Ain't Half Hot Mum? A Clockwork Orange is a virtual gallery of British character actors, including Patrick Magee, Anthony Sharp and Margaret Tyzack. </p> <p>It is at least partly their presence that gives A Clockwork Orange elements of an early 70s soft-core sex comedy - with McDowell as a kind of Bizarro-world Robin Askwith, larking about with his mates, picking up birds at the local record shop and getting laid. The rape scenes that caused all the flap then are pretty wince-making now: unpleasant and uncomfortable for the wrong reasons. </p> <p>There are quite a few: a woman is brutally raped to Singin' in the Rain, while the audience is forced into the position of her husband, bound, gagged and made to watch. A woman is almost raped by a rival gang, and there is another sexual assault in the filmed violence Alex is made to watch in prison. A Clockwork Orange shows that the master's penchant for tits-and-panties semi-nudity did not begin with Eyes Wide Shut; there is a lot of raunchy sashaying about from bare-breasted women and the juxtaposition of these swinging moments with fairly crude rape scenes suggests that Kubrick mentally filed rape under \"sex\" rather than \"violence\". </p> <p>The assault on the tramp that begins the film still delivers a spine-tingling shock to the senses: a hypnotically unpleasant moment. After a few liveners in the weird milk-bar, with its pseudo-sexy decor and fashion-shoot lighting, the droogs arrive at a strange, deserted underpass to see a drunk, prostrate tramp singing. When they sneeringly start to applaud, the sense of imminent violence is horrible, chillingly enhanced by its strange, semi-realist setting. This violence has been widely called amoral, and this is probably right; it was a misplaced gallantry for the film's supporters to claim it is \"intensely moral\". </p> <p>That is not really true, though there is a queasy slickness to the violence, a balletic ritualisation that arguably acts as a prophylactic, as Alexander Walker has argued. (And the slow-motion scene of the droogs strolling along the marina is very reminiscent of Mr Blue, Mr Orange et al.) But what is also important is that A Clockwork Orange, in its own warped way, shows the consequences of violence, and gives violence an intelligible context. The tramp is not forgotten; he returns at the end and exacts a terrible vengeance. And we learn that the victim of Alex's rape died after the assault, ostensibly of an unrelated illness, but that her grieving widower knows in his heart that the rapist is guilty. It is a strangely affecting moment, unexpectedly drawing on the messiness and pathos of real life. </p> <p>It is the scenes in prison that take A Clockwork Orange into the realms of inspiration; here it becomes a brilliant essay in cynicism and paranoia, rooted in an age in which Harold Wilson's progressivism had been trounced in the 1970 general election by Ted Heath's \"Selsdon\" project of political reaction, an age in which race violence was on the increase and the Northern Ireland Troubles had just begun. </p> <p>Keen to clear \"ordinary\" criminals like Alex out of prison to make room for political subversives, the government makes him the guinea-pig for a fast-track rehabilitation-brainwash: an aversion therapy in which he is forced to watch scenes of violence, his eyelids clipped open, saline solution dropped into his flinching eyeballs. </p> <p>The ghosts of Foucault and RD Laing attend Kubrick's vision of the state's economy of violence: how criminal aberrance is countered with clinical, scientific subjection. These scenes are unforgettably horrible and offer a prescient commentary on censorship: here is the traumatised cinemagoer, unable to stop the state flooding his consciousness with screen images of violence.</p> <p>Is this the censor's world turned upside down? Or actually the power of the censor writ large - the censor's yearning to control and regulate human reaction to screen images? (\"It's funny how the colours of the real, real world are not real until you viddy them on film,\" muses Alex between sessions, anticipating a very modern critical discourse on how we have come to think of screen representations of the world as more real than reality itself.) </p> <p>Finally, Kubrick shows the nation being scandalised by this technique, via headlines in the Telegraph and the old broadsheet Mail - eerily, just the sort of newspaper hue-and-cry which would drive A Clockwork Orange off the screen. </p> <p>What an incredible punch Clockwork Orange packs, like a visitor from another planet, among the production-line dullness of most cinema. This is ironic violence, stylised violence, but violence with human consequences and human cost. </p> <p>The reissuing of A Clockwork Orange is a reclamation of part of movie history. While American movie brats such as Coppola, Scorsese, Friedkin and Altman were making the 70s a thrilling era for movie-making, it turns out that this country had a part to play in it as well. Here in Britain, Kubrick was showing that the spirit of the Easy Riders, Raging Bulls era was conceived not just in Los Angeles, Burbank and Manhattan, but in Radlett and Harpenden and St Albans. For all its flaws and cracks, this is a film that has to be seen, and its re-release is a festival day in the history of British cinema.</p> <p><strong>A very British nightmare</strong></p> <p>How the press reacted</p> <p>\"What on earth induced our censors to pass these startling scenes of rape and violence?...

      "bodyText": "Former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet arrived back in Chile today, 16 months after he was detained in Britain on torture charges. General Pinochet's plane was greeted by Chilean flags, German march music and vociferous debate about his fate. The general left Britain a free man yesterday after home secretary Jack Straw ruled that the 84-year-old former dictator was mentally and physically unfit to be extradited to Spain for trial on charges of human rights abuses. Chile's top army brass gathered at the military section of the Santiago airport in a solemn welcome ceremony that displeased the government. \"It appears improper to organise this as if it was a party, in spite of the circumstances under which Pinochet was allowed to leave London,\" said interior minister Raul Troncoso. Gen Pinochet left the plane in a wheelchair and was lowered to the tarmac on an improvised lift. Once on the ground, the 84-year-old former ruler stood up to the cheers of a crowd of gathered supporters.

Lucas's agent wanted him to ask for a then hefty $500,000 upfront. But Lucas chose to ask for the merchandising rights instead. There are no official figures, but one decent estimate for the value of Star Wars products sold pre-Phantom Menace is $4.5 billion, or four times more than the cinema takings of the trilogy. Not all of that went to Lucas, of course, but you can see why he stopped directing films. </p> <p>These days, everyone knows where merchandising fits into the order of things. Long before its late November US release, the licensing arrangements for the live action version of Dr Seuss's How The Grinch Stole Christmas, starring Jim Carrey, are being finalised. The hoped-for Grinchmania will come courtesy of burgers by Wendy's, credit cards by Visa, chocolate bars by Hershey, cookies by Nabisco, cereals by Kellogg's (of course) and all sorts of toys. The movie advertises the toys, and the toys and the burgers and everything else advertise the movie. And those arrangements are just for the US. Home licensing of the movies is done by the studios themselves: Sony, for instance, have a whole products division called Sony Signatures. But for the rest of the world, they use agencies to find the right chains and manufacturers to work with. One of the biggest is the London-based Copyright Promotions Licensing Group, who worked with Sony on Godzilla and Stuart Little (out in July) and are currently getting excited about the Charlie's Angels movie, which has only just started shooting and isn't due out here until December. Charlie's Angels is a big deal because most merchandising is aimed at kids or sci-fi fans. Sci-fi is ever popular, acknowledges CPLG's managing director Claire Atherton. And kid's movies are easily merchandised. Children see a movie, they want to be part of it and they use \"pester power\" on their parents. But Charlie's Angels is different. It has real thirtysomething appeal, Atherton says with relish. </p> <p>While marketing aimed at 70s nostalgics is fair game, it's the targeting of children that gets parents' groups upset. But whatever they would like to believe, there is nothing new about it. Most men who grew up in the 60s or early 70s can bore you about Dinky or Corgi Batmobiles, Thunderbirds and James Bond Aston Martins, not to mention Six Million Dollar Man dolls. But tie-ins started long before that - the grandaddy of the business was Herman Kamen, the man who won the right to license Disney products back in the 30s. </p> <p>What has changed is scale. In 1980 - after the Star Wars revolution - the sales of all licensed products worldwide were worth $10 billion. By 1998, they were up to $110 billion in the US. Movie tie-ins make up an estimated 22% of that total. The Lion King has generated $1.5 billion and rising in sales of licensed products. </p> <p>Business is so good that one heretical consultant suggested to McDonalds that they should start regarding toys, not burgers, as their primary product. After all, no-one has ever rioted for a burger, but branches of McDonalds in Singa-pore were smashed up by rabid fans trying to get their hands on Hello Kitty giveaways. </p> <p>\"In our business, I look at box office, but then I relate that back to the sell-through of product at retail,\" says DreamWorks licensing chief Travis Rutherford. \"Though many people say the two are directly related, oftentimes they're not. Box office can outsell product and vice versa.\" It just makes more sense to make films like Toy Story or A Bug's Life than the live action movies Disney used to do in the 70s. But that's no reason to shed tears over the triumph of commerce over art. \"Toyetic\" issues aside, you would have to be truly twisted to claim that The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes was better than Toy Story 2. </p> <p>Just in case this all sounds glibly like a story where everybody wins (apart, obviously, from the sweatshop workers in China who actually make the toys and baseball caps), here's a cautionary tale. The Phantom Menace was meant to be the greatest thing in the whole of movie tie-in history. British publishers Dorling Kindersley were so convinced by this thought that they printed 13 million copies of Star Wars Episode I Incredible Cross-Sections and Star Wars: The Visual Dictionary. In the words of one veteran bookseller: \"What the hell were they thinking of? You can't sell that many copies of the Bible!\" Dorling Kindersley ended up with ten million unsold books, and an estimated pre-tax loss of $41 million compared to a $19 million profit the previous year. Dorling Kindersley CEO James Middlehurst did the decent thing and resigned. Maybe he's having a quiet drink somewhere with the man from Fox who signed away a fortune to George Lucas all those years ago.</p>",

After all, no-one has ever rioted for a burger, but branches of McDonalds in Singa-pore were smashed up by rabid fans trying to get their hands on Hello Kitty giveaways. \"In our business, I look at box office, but then I relate that back to the sell-through of product at retail,\" says DreamWorks licensing chief Travis Rutherford. \"Though many people say the two are directly related, oftentimes they're not. Box office can outsell product and vice versa.\" It just makes more sense to make films like Toy Story or A Bug's Life than the live action movies Disney used to do in the 70s. But that's no reason to shed tears over the triumph of commerce over art. \"Toyetic\" issues aside, you would have to be truly twisted to claim that The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes was better than Toy Story 2. Just in case this all sounds glibly like a story where everybody wins (apart, obviously, from the sweatshop workers in China who actually make the toys and baseball caps), here's a cautionary tale. The Phantom Menace was meant to be the greatest thing in the whole of movie tie-in history. British publishers Dorling Kindersley were so convinced by this thought that they printed 13 million copies of Star Wars Episode I Incredible Cross-Sections and Star Wars: The Visual Dictionary. In the words of one veteran bookseller: \"What the hell were they thinking of? You can't sell that many copies of the Bible!\" Dorling Kindersley ended up with ten million unsold books, and an estimated pre-tax loss of $41 million compared to a $19 million profit the previous year. Dorling Kindersley CEO James Middlehurst did the decent thing and resigned. Maybe he's having a quiet drink somewhere with the man from Fox who signed away a fortune to George Lucas all those years ago.",

There's the melting lamb slow roasted with endive and red onions in unctuous gravy, or the faultless roast rib of beef and puffy Yorkshire puds for the traditionalist.

This quintessentially English country house hotel serves a model Sunday lunch - three courses, chocolates and coffee for \u00a314.50. It offers an impeccable fish and prawn cake with a foamy chive butter sauce, and memorable home made terrines (game, chicken and cardamom) with melba toast and chutneys. There's the melting lamb slow roasted with endive and red onions in unctuous gravy, or the faultless roast rib of beef and puffy Yorkshire puds for the traditionalist. Killer puddings include warm pecan pie, caramelised rice pudding with cherries, a definitive lemon tart or peaches in brandy with cr\u00e8me frache parfait. Quick bites . . . where to eat out in under 15 minutes Black Dog Inn, Dalton-in-Furness, Cumbria. Tel: 01229 462561. Local Camra Pub of the Year 1998, so that looks after the beer side (Coniston Bluebird, Wye Valley Hereford Pale Ale, Yates Bitter, York's Yorkshire Terrier). And a dedication to local ingredients enlivens the grub side of things, especially bar snacks, so it's hey-ho for Cumbrian air-dried ham, bacon chops and Cumberland sausage. Does the heftier stuff, too - ham hocks and lamb shanks, game casserole and braised rabbit - but if it's the short, sharp snack you're after, there's a true home made soup, buttered kipper, proper ploughman's, hot bacon baps and hand-crafted chips, all for under a fiver.

Mrs Jane King, Co Kildare, Ireland. \u0095 If you have a tip for the Cheat's kitchen, please send it to The Guzzler, The Guardian, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3 ER. The taste test: fresh pasta There's pasta alimentare or pasta asciutta - dry pasta made from flour and water which lasts for ever. And there is pasta all'uovo - egg pasta made from flour and eggs, which is made to eat fresh. It's easy to make yourself, but then that's what supermarkets are for: to sell us what we can't be bothered to make ourselves. Asda spaghetti \u00a31.39/500g. At least it tastes as if it contains eggs. Decent firm texture, too. **** Co-op tagliatelle 99p/250g Nice clean texture. Hint of egg in there somwhere. **** Pasta reale festivale 99p/250g Faint taste of boiled wool, but not bad. Do not mistake for delicious buckwheat pasta. *** Safeway paglio e fieno 99p/250g Slightly slippery customer. Utterly neutral in every other way. ** and a half.

Ann Wroe became obsessed with the haunting figure of Pontius Pilate nearly five years ago, but painstaking research turned up little more than the fact that, really, we know few facts about him. Never mind, she must have thought bracingly, we'll do supposition instead. And suppose she has (for 400 pages) in <strong> Pilate</strong>, drawing together every different legend, play and picture of him and, basically, just guessing. <br> <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502370402,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a> </p> <p>Peter Robb got lucky with Caravaggio (slightly more material to work with), but even he admits to just making up his own mind on certain points in <strong> M</strong> (such as the minor matter of Caravaggio's death - or murder). And, as with Motion and Wroe, Robb has taken a firm attitude on the prose front: make it visceral, make it immediate. He even makes up a name for his subject - \"M\" - because Caravaggio went by so many others. How impertinent is that? <br> <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502337151,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>David Wilbourne's fictionalised diary of the Virgin Mary,<strong> A Virgin's Diary</strong>, does all the irritating things that this type of writing is capable of (and which the three above, to their credit, mainly avoid). Can anything be more aggravating than Mary's description of her pregnant cravings: \"I gorge myself on loaves and loaves of flat bread, with sardines sandwiched between every slice. I'm sure I've eaten enough to feed 5,000 by now\"? <br> <a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,502295460,00.html\">Buy it at BOL</a></p> <p>By contrast, Edmund Wilson's <strong> Dutch</strong> (admittedly, of all five he had most material: 13 years by Ronald Reagan's side) is wonderful. Yes, he cannot be bothered to write a totally straightforward biography, either. He talks about himself a lot (but after 13 years of research, you would feel a bit involved), and tells parts of the story in the style of a film script, a documentary, and through conversations with friends. It seems if you want to make this bid for biographical autonomy (we tell those stories, we'll decide what happened) the main qualification is that you have to be an absolutely brilliant writer.

Ann Wroe became obsessed with the haunting figure of Pontius Pilate nearly five years ago, but painstaking research turned up little more than the fact that, really, we know few facts about him. Never mind, she must have thought bracingly, we'll do supposition instead. And suppose she has (for 400 pages) in Pilate, drawing together every different legend, play and picture of him and, basically, just guessing. Buy it at BOL Peter Robb got lucky with Caravaggio (slightly more material to work with), but even he admits to just making up his own mind on certain points in M (such as the minor matter of Caravaggio's death - or murder). And, as with Motion and Wroe, Robb has taken a firm attitude on the prose front: make it visceral, make it immediate. He even makes up a name for his subject - \"M\" - because Caravaggio went by so many others. How impertinent is that? Buy it at BOL David Wilbourne's fictionalised diary of the Virgin Mary, A Virgin's Diary, does all the irritating things that this type of writing is capable of (and which the three above, to their credit, mainly avoid). Can anything be more aggravating than Mary's description of her pregnant cravings: \"I gorge myself on loaves and loaves of flat bread, with sardines sandwiched between every slice. I'm sure I've eaten enough to feed 5,000 by now\"? Buy it at BOL By contrast, Edmund Wilson's Dutch (admittedly, of all five he had most material: 13 years by Ronald Reagan's side) is wonderful. Yes, he cannot be bothered to write a totally straightforward biography, either. He talks about himself a lot (but after 13 years of research, you would feel a bit involved), and tells parts of the story in the style of a film script, a documentary, and through conversations with friends. It seems if you want to make this bid for biographical autonomy (we tell those stories, we'll decide what happened) the main qualification is that you have to be an absolutely brilliant writer. How fortunate.",

By last night the cost had been halved to \u00a31.15m. In a change of approach, military sources were agreeing to \"defray some of the costs\".

There have been more than a few warnings that Mozambique's misery was only going to worsen.</p> <p>The downpour which struck at the end of January dumped a year's rainfall on the country in the space of four days. They were the heaviest for half a century. After the first floods, Britain and other governments funded the usual emergency medical supplies and tenting and food. South Africa sent five helicopters to lift food and other aid to the homeless.</p> <p>One puzzle is how, with so many experienced aid agencies present, it could take so long to recognise the urgent need for helicopters and boats.</p> <p>Two weeks ago, Cyclone Eline began tearing through Madagascar, where it left seven people dead. Then it turned toward Mozambique. By then, the UN had a contingent from its office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs in Maputo planning how to deal with the existing floods. Britain's DfID sent a team on February 11.</p> <p>Eline did not prove to be as devastating as feared, although it drove tens of thousands from their homes. Aid donors took it as a sign that the worst was past. But it was a false dawn.</p> <p>It went unnoticed that Cyclone Eline was pouring huge amounts of waters into the already swollen Limpopo and Save rivers in South Africa and Zimbabwe. No one planned for what would happen when that water came back down the rivers and into Mozambique.</p> <p>They discovered in the middle of last Saturday night. There was no preparation by foreign donors. It was already evident that helicopters would be crucial, but as the flooding consumed entire towns, no one had resolved the question of who was going to pay for the existing five South African helicopters let alone additional aircraft.</p> <p>Aid agencies have admitted they were caught unawares by the opening of overwhelmed dams upstream in Zimbabwe and South Africa. They were also not prepared to help with rescue efforts. \"We would be looking to governments and armed forces for that,\" said Nicola Pazdzierska of the DEC. \"It's not what humanitarian agencies are all about.\"</p> <p>The Red Cross took a similar view. \"Helicopters are very expensive,\" said a spokeswoman. \"We don't see ourselves as a rescue service. We are more of a service to help people once they have been rescued.\" At one stage, she added, they had inquired about hiring an aircraft and be told it was $80,000 a day.</p> <p>The Mozambique disaster has exposed an embarrassing weakness in Britain's military ability to mount operations involving the movement of heavy equipment, such as helicopters and boats. This gap in the MoD's capability was singled out in the 1988 strategic defence review: RAF Hercules transporters are too small to carry large helicopters.</p> <p>DfID's first instinct was to charter local South African helicopters; they were nearer. But on Monday (according to DfID) or Tuesday (according to the MoD), Clare Short's department asked the MoD if it could spare some helicopters.</p> <p>\"There were none within 3,000 miles,\" was the reply. It would take nine days sailing from the Persian Gulf to reach Mozambique said defence officials.</p> <p>In the meantime, DfID officials located another five helicopters in Mozambique and South Africa and hired them immediately. Not until late on Wednesday, after two days of wrangling, was the green light given to despatch the RAF Pumas by a chartered Antonov.</p> <p>The Mozambique floods underline the need for improved international early warning centres and coordination of rapid response forces.</p> <p>At the beginning of the week there were just seven helicopters dedicated to rescue missions. Now there are at least 17. No one knows the death toll, or how many died for want of rescuing in the first days. Even now, priorities are not what they should be. Yesterday, one commercial helicopter which had been plucking people from the waters was taken off its rescue mission to fly a Danish EU commissioner, Poul Nielson, to view the devastation.</p> <p><b>Always too little and too late?</b></p> <p><b> Venezuelan floods, December 1999</b></p> <p>20,000-30,000 dead</p> <p>400,000 homeless</p> <p>$2bn damage</p> <p>Torrential storms caused flooding and landslides in and around Caracas on December 16. It took five days for the International Red Cross to launch an appeal for $2.8m (\u00a31.75m) to fly in medical supplies. On December 20, the country's foreign minister, Jose Vicente Rangel, was quoted as saying that more foreign aid was needed. \"It's never enough, given the magnitude of the tragedy, solidarity is never enough.\"</p> <p><b> Orissa, India, cyclone October 1999</b></p> <p> 10,000 dead</p> <p>2m homes destroyed, 12m families affected</p> <p>$3.5bn damage</p> <p>Gales of up to 170mph hit the east coast of India in Orissa on October 29. It took three days for a relief effort to begin, when India's prime minister announced a \u00a342m rescue package. Five days after the storm, the coordination centre consisted of six workers, two telephones and a fax machine. The Red Cross launched a preliminary appeal for $2.5m, and Britain's emergency committee launched an appeal for the victims.</p> <p><b> Izmit, Turkey, earthquake, August 1999</b></p> <p> 18,000 dead</p> <p>100,000 affected</p> <p>An earthquake of 7.8 on the Richter scale struck north-west Turkey on August 17. The government of Turkey was criticised for failing to have prepared emergency plan for a big earthquake.

The launch of a celebrity-led appeal yesterday by the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC), representing 11 major charities, may mobilise further public support and raise millions more. Behind the popular enthusiasm, however, an inter-departmental political storm is brewing over delays in despatching helicopters to the flooded region. Last night it became clear that the ministry of defence (MoD), which initially told the department for international development (DfID) that it should bear the cost of transporting helicopters to the disaster region, had offered to share the bill. The MoD at first asked DfID for \u00a32.2m for the package of 100 RAF pilots, support staff, four Puma helicopters and the freight transporter fare to Mozambique.

Having already spent \u00a36m on aid to Mozambique, Britain is now one of the largest international donors. For those in southern Africa who have watched since the rains came a month ago, a more fundamental flaw has been lack of planning: only television pictures of refugees clinging to the treetops panicked the international aid community into the necessary response. All along, local observers have argued, the UN and foreign governments have responded to each twist of the crisis belatedly and with little forethought to what might happen next. There have been more than a few warnings that Mozambique's misery was only going to worsen. The downpour which struck at the end of January dumped a year's rainfall on the country in the space of four days. They were the heaviest for half a century. After the first floods, Britain and other governments funded the usual emergency medical supplies and tenting and food. South Africa sent five helicopters to lift food and other aid to the homeless.

No one planned for what would happen when that water came back down the rivers and into Mozambique. They discovered in the middle of last Saturday night. There was no preparation by foreign donors. It was already evident that helicopters would be crucial, but as the flooding consumed entire towns, no one had resolved the question of who was going to pay for the existing five South African helicopters let alone additional aircraft. Aid agencies have admitted they were caught unawares by the opening of overwhelmed dams upstream in Zimbabwe and South Africa. They were also not prepared to help with rescue efforts. \"We would be looking to governments and armed forces for that,\" said Nicola Pazdzierska of the DEC. \"It's not what humanitarian agencies are all about.\" The Red Cross took a similar view. \"Helicopters are very expensive,\" said a spokeswoman. \"We don't see ourselves as a rescue service. We are more of a service to help people once they have been rescued.\" At one stage, she added, they had inquired about hiring an aircraft and be told it was $80,000 a day. The Mozambique disaster has exposed an embarrassing weakness in Britain's military ability to mount operations involving the movement of heavy equipment, such as helicopters and boats. This gap in the MoD's capability was singled out in the 1988 strategic defence review: RAF Hercules transporters are too small to carry large helicopters. DfID's first instinct was to charter local South African helicopters; they were nearer. But on Monday (according to DfID) or Tuesday (according to the MoD), Clare Short's department asked the MoD if it could spare some helicopters. \"There were none within 3,000 miles,\" was the reply. It would take nine days sailing from the Persian Gulf to reach Mozambique said defence officials. In the meantime, DfID officials located another five helicopters in Mozambique and South Africa and hired them immediately. Not until late on Wednesday, after two days of wrangling, was the green light given to despatch the RAF Pumas by a chartered Antonov. The Mozambique floods underline the need for improved international early warning centres and coordination of rapid response forces. At the beginning of the week there were just seven helicopters dedicated to rescue missions. Now there are at least 17. No one knows the death toll, or how many died for want of rescuing in the first days. Even now, priorities are not what they should be. Yesterday, one commercial helicopter which had been plucking people from the waters was taken off its rescue mission to fly a Danish EU commissioner, Poul Nielson, to view the devastation. Always too little and too late? Venezuelan floods, December 1999 20,000-30,000 dead 400,000 homeless $2bn damage Torrential storms caused flooding and landslides in and around Caracas on December 16. It took five days for the International Red Cross to launch an appeal for $2.8m (\u00a31.75m) to fly in medical supplies. On December 20, the country's foreign minister, Jose Vicente Rangel, was quoted as saying that more foreign aid was needed. \"It's never enough, given the magnitude of the tragedy, solidarity is never enough.\" Orissa, India, cyclone October 1999 10,000 dead 2m homes destroyed, 12m families affected $3.5bn damage Gales of up to 170mph hit the east coast of India in Orissa on October 29. It took three days for a relief effort to begin, when India's prime minister announced a \u00a342m rescue package. Five days after the storm, the coordination centre consisted of six workers, two telephones and a fax machine. The Red Cross launched a preliminary appeal for $2.5m, and Britain's emergency committee launched an appeal for the victims. Izmit, Turkey, earthquake, August 1999 18,000 dead 100,000 affected An earthquake of 7.8 on the Richter scale struck north-west Turkey on August 17. The government of Turkey was criticised for failing to have prepared emergency plan for a big earthquake. The Turkish army was active immediately, but was accused of focusing much of its early efforts on searching for survivors of a destroyed naval base in Golcuk. It took three days for national emergency teams to reach the worst-hit areas. Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador, Hurricane Mitch, October 1998 11,000 dead, 1m refugees $5bn damage Forecasters predicted the hurricane, which struck on October 27. But the west only responded after the event. The US initially pledged just $2m, later increased to $30m. In Britain, Clare Short was criticised for initially refusing to write off the region's debt. Britain first pledged \u00a351,000, raising it \u00a3750,000 in direct aid. It took almost a week for large-scale food and emergency equipment to reach the region. Those wishing to contribute to the DEC's appeal can ring 0870-6060900.",

Mr Mugabe personally wrote in the reference to Britain. He said on television yesterday that the land had been stolen from Africans, and that he would not act against the squatters. But a few hours later Mr Dabengwa, who is in charge of the national police, told the squatters to be off the farms by tomorrow morning or face police action. He said they would soon be able to get the land legally through the constitutional amendment. The wave of farm invasions was \"a difficult political issue and we had to find a political solution\", he said. David Hasluck, head of the farmers' union, said farming districts were facing anarchy as police refused to act. It will take 30 days for the amendment to become law. It has been published in the government gazette and must now have three readings in parliament. It is virtually guaranteed the two-thirds parliamentary support it needs to become law, because Mr Mugabe's Zanu-PF party controls 147 of the 150 seats. The government's move is widely viewed by ordinary Zimbabweans as well as political analysts as a desperate attempt to use the land issue to regain popularity before the parliamentary elections, which are due in mid-April. \"Everybody knows these squatters were sent in by the government to create a big stink so that Mugabe can say he is solving the problem with the amendment,\" said Mabel Munondo, an office worker in the capital, Harare. \"We did not want Mugabe's land clause in the draft constitution and we do not want it now. What Zimbabwe needs is fair redistribution of land, but Mugabe and his crooks will keep the land for themselves.\" \"These farm invasions are a cheap political ploy,\" said Brian Kagoro, spokesman for the national constitutional assembly which campaigned against Mr Mugabe's draft constitution. \"The invasions are clearly illegal. It is very worrying that the police failed to maintain the law. When civic societies want to demonstrate peacefully the police are quick to prevent us, with tear gas and truncheons, but when government supporters invade farms, it is OK.\" Mr Kagoro said he was \"certain the government took a deliberate decision to amend the constitution and felt it needed an international incident like the farm invasions to justify their actions.\" The authorities were now trying to make it appear as if they were \"responding to pressure rising from the people\", Mr Kagoro said.",

      "body": "<p>Pig 140 looks swell. Almost one third of a ton swell: two rows of six swollen pink teats flapping like pelmets beneath her, a wicked piggy grin, snout high in the early morning Yorkshire air, she trots across Farmer Grant Burton's field for breakfast, a scratch and a sniff.</p> <p>Congratulations, Pig 140. Last night she gave birth to 10 piglets. The plump little 2lb pork barrels are curled up and kicking and squealing on a bed of fresh straw in their 12ft by 5ft insulated, corrugated farrowing house in the middle of a field.</p> <p>Pig 140 gets her nuts and a scratch. Grant, an immense man, approves. \"Intelligent animals are pigs,\" he says. \"Sociable, too. Individual. Playful. They've got ideas of their own, go their own way. Dogs look up to you, they say, cats look down, but pigs are your equal.\" He tells of a vicar who used to use them as dogs on the hunt: \"Pigs' sense of smell is 50 times better than dogs. They're much cleaner than cows, too. And they look you in the eye, you know.\"</p> <p>On cue, Pig 140 fixes Grant with a bright, olive eye from under long blonde lashes, grunts and returns slowly to her family. It's a small miracle that none of the Yorkshire 10 are crushed as she lies down. They attach themselves to her in the time-honoured order: strongest take the front teats, weakest the rear.</p> <p>Pigsville is stirring. In the same field, 25 other great sows and three grizzled boars are being fed. Another group of 30 is waiting, spreadeagled, head down, snout to snout, some snoring in the hay. Further on, by a wallow pool, a young boar is servicing 30 gilts, the young females. The object of his thrusts looks serenely bored, continuing to root around in the mud for food handouts. Gestation, should it happen, will take three months, three weeks and three days. It is the age-old pig cycle.</p> <p>It all looks normal enough. Happy, healthy, well-looked-after, free-range pigs. None of your tethered or stalled beasts. Big-hearted, cricket-loving farmers. Beautiful situation in the rolling North Riding. Rooks flapping lazily in the mists. Young Mark and Matthew, local lads, dealing out the food. Grant's mum cooking sausages and bacon in the farmhouse. Brother Mark on the computer checking out pig prices. Spring busting out everywhere. What could be wrong?</p> <p>Everything. This is a social, financial and agricultural nightmare. The British pig industry, like the hill farmers and others, is bumping along the bottom of the longest, deepest crisis it has ever known. Every pig reared in Britain is losing the farmers between \u00a35 and \u00a310. Prices collapsed in 1996 and have not recovered, except for a brief spell when the Dutch had to slaughter millions when swine fever erupted.</p> <p>Almost 4,000 pig farms, one in three in Britain, have gone out of business since 1994. Mostly it's been the small and medium-sized farms, but now the big ones are suffering and two of three of Britain's best-known have recently gone under. The pigs have their natural cycle and the industry has its cycles of regular ups and downs, too. But this time there are no ups.</p> <p>It's been catastrophic for the Burtons and their average-sized family farm near Pocklington. In a really good year, their 350 sows might make \u00a340,000 profit. But those days are faint memories. Last year, they lost more than \u00a3100,000 and this year is as bad. They are living on just \u00a370 a week. For the past year they have been downsizing, from more than 350 sows to fewer than 250 now. The family \"silver\" is being sold off. Last week, they decided to sell the farm cottage. It hurts. The long-term tenant must go.</p> <p>Every week the brothers send another load of pigs to the slaughterhouse and see their overdraft rise. They lose about \u00a38 on every pig they rear. There are no subsidies and no sign that the crisis will be over in the foreseeable future. The harsh reality, says a new Lloyds Bank analysis of the industry, is that thousands more farms must go out of business before there is an upturn. By the end of this month, Grant and Philip may only be able to survive another few weeks. Many others in the region are taking stock, too. They all know it could be the end.</p> <p>\"We're in the bottom of the trough,\" says Grant. \"It's a case of gritting your teeth and tightening the belt. People have put their pensions into pig farming, they have lost everything. This isn't a normal cycle. If something doesn't happen soon, we'll have to get rid of the men. It's not possible to over-emphasise the seriousness of what is happening.\"</p> <p>The battered farmers have tried everything from demonstrating to persuading the supermarkets and the army to buy British. They blame the very high pound that means European importers can flood the British market with cheap meat, and leaves them unable to export; they blame the supermarkets who are profiting hugely from their crisis.</p> <p>The anger is turning to resignation. They know that there has been over-production but they say that's just half the story. It's unfair that they should have to meet higher animal welfare standards when the rest of Europe can avoid them and so undercut them; they claim BSE, which had nothing to do with pigs, costs them an extra \u00a35 on every animal; they despise a system that allows pigs reared anywhere in the world to be imported whole and then be processed here and sold as \"British\". They say that the government has only offered to help them with marketing. They don't want sympathy or subsidies, but they do want a fair share.</p> <p>Five hundred yards away, Matthew and Mark have moved on from feeding Pig 140 and her colleagues to herding 140 youngsters into haulier Malcolm Smith's big blue lorry to send them to the giant Malton slaughterhouse 15 miles away. With lots of \"Go on, lads\", and \"Come on, girls\", the pigs go up the ramp willingly enough. A few start fighting. Their bright, white saliva stains the black mud.</p> <p>Malcolm has been carting pigs and farm animals around Britain for 30 years, and knows every pig farmer in Yorkshire and most markets and slaughterhouses in Britain. \"Glad I'm not a farmer now,\" he says. \"Dad had a black and white pig. It followed us around everywhere. Every small holding had a pig. We killed our own.\"</p> <p>He's not morose by nature but what he sees, as he does his rounds, shocks him. \"This is as bad as anything I've seen in 28 years. Pretty grim, is the mood of the farmers. How long can they keep going? They're on the bank's doors. Nobody's doing well. A lot of them are on the tender edge,\" he says.</p> <p>He's talking suicides. In the past few months, at least half a dozen farmers in the region have killed themselves. Many others, as confirmed by a NUJ report into tenant farmers this week, are desperate, with one in four saying they are having marital problems because of the crisis; 70% are unable to sleep and 60% fear they will lose every thing. One in 10 are being prescribed anti-depressants.</p> <p>The land looks neat and tended, but the view from Malcolm's cab is bleak, with sign after sign of a divided and depressed economy. There are union jacks in the fields and signs asking: \"Is it British?\" Farm buildings are being converted into flats. Where communities had five farms only a few years ago, now they have one or two. There are self-service signs at the farm gates. The abattoirs are cutting back, says Malcolm; there's less work for the hauliers, the feed merchants, the carpenters and builders, the processors, and all the way down the food chain. Farms are practically giving away produce.</p> <p>We truck through deserted commuter villages. As the small farmers go bankrupt or leave, so the land is being gobbled up by the large estates who in turn are moving towards \"contract\" farming, where fewer local people are employed and the contact between the brought-in labour and the community is even less. \"It's like we're going backwards,\" says Malcolm. \"The traditional communities are fracturing; the shops going.\"</p> <p>The farmers' markets, where farmers can sell directly to the public, may be one bright spot. But the odds are that the British industry will shed another quarter or more of its pig farms in the next year, and in the long-term things may be worse. The Lloyd's Bank analysis suggests that even a more efficient, smaller industry will never be able to compete on the world market in which farming is now thrust. Global and European corporations, working on an unimaginable scale, are already targeting Britain and the big new threat is likely to come from the US.</p> <p>Hog farms in North Carolina are now the size of British cities, with up to 1m breeding sows - more than 100 times the size of the biggest British operations. The smallest viable units are now bigger than even the largest British ones, and are unable to compete. Communities near the giant farms are up in arms over the pollution and it's only a matter of time before Britain is flooded with the cheapest pigs in the world. The social, environmental and economic price of cheap food will be paid by the rural communities.</p> <p>But the British supermarkets, who traditionally have little loyalty to their producers, may get there first in their search for the cheapest cuts. There is talk of Asda, owned by giant US retailer Wal-Mart, setting up a pig farm in Poland 10 times the size of Britain's largest to provide all the chain's meat. It would be another nail in the coffin of British farming.</p> <p>The reality is that four or five giant US-sized pig farms could produce most of the 1m tons of pig meat that we eat every year. Never mind the welfare standards or how the pigs are reared - under world trade rules, which prevent protectionism, there is little or nothing that British ministers can do except preside over the virtual end of an industry. And for pigs, read cows, fruit and vegetables, too.</p> <p>Malcolm, Grant and Mark understand this perfectly. \"Britain is becoming just a dumping ground now. It's going to be left to one or two producers,\" says Grant. He's a natural Tory, but he blames Margaret Thatcher and the rush to the free global market. \"A whole new atmosphere came in then,\" he says. \"The old relationships between people broke down. Nothing mattered except the profit motive. It became the devil-take-the-hindmost society. This is a fundamental breakdown of everything that we know. We don't want to make a fortune, just a living. Yes, in one sense we're like the third world here.\"</p> <p>Malcolm's wagon arrives at the Malton slaughterhouse. It's a huge, grim-looking factory on an industrial estate with chimneys belching, tall tanks of blood, black gut, sludge and effluent, and that lingering smell of fresh death. We queue up on the concrete yard with wagons from Lincolnshire, Norfolk and Northumberland, each with 150 or more pigs. Malton used to kill 8,000 pigs a day, now it's 6,000.</p> <p>They are signed in by a Mr McCarthy and Malcolm helps unload them. Within the hour, they will be gassed and on their way to being a traditional British breakfast or pie. Tomorrow, he'll bring more in from elsewhere; next week Grant and Mark will get a cheque for more than \u00a37,000 but will be \u00a31,120 poorer and the whole pig cycle will go on. Except that in a few weeks he and his family will decide whether or not to chuck the whole lot in.</p>",

As the small farmers go bankrupt or leave, so the land is being gobbled up by the large estates who in turn are moving towards \"contract\" farming, where fewer local people are employed and the contact between the brought-in labour and the community is even less. \"It's like we're going backwards,\" says Malcolm. \"The traditional communities are fracturing; the shops going.\" The farmers' markets, where farmers can sell directly to the public, may be one bright spot. But the odds are that the British industry will shed another quarter or more of its pig farms in the next year, and in the long-term things may be worse. The Lloyd's Bank analysis suggests that even a more efficient, smaller industry will never be able to compete on the world market in which farming is now thrust. Global and European corporations, working on an unimaginable scale, are already targeting Britain and the big new threat is likely to come from the US. Hog farms in North Carolina are now the size of British cities, with up to 1m breeding sows - more than 100 times the size of the biggest British operations. The smallest viable units are now bigger than even the largest British ones, and are unable to compete. Communities near the giant farms are up in arms over the pollution and it's only a matter of time before Britain is flooded with the cheapest pigs in the world. The social, environmental and economic price of cheap food will be paid by the rural communities. But the British supermarkets, who traditionally have little loyalty to their producers, may get there first in their search for the cheapest cuts. There is talk of Asda, owned by giant US retailer Wal-Mart, setting up a pig farm in Poland 10 times the size of Britain's largest to provide all the chain's meat. It would be another nail in the coffin of British farming. The reality is that four or five giant US-sized pig farms could produce most of the 1m tons of pig meat that we eat every year. Never mind the welfare standards or how the pigs are reared - under world trade rules, which prevent protectionism, there is little or nothing that British ministers can do except preside over the virtual end of an industry. And for pigs, read cows, fruit and vegetables, too. Malcolm, Grant and Mark understand this perfectly. \"Britain is becoming just a dumping ground now. It's going to be left to one or two producers,\" says Grant. He's a natural Tory, but he blames Margaret Thatcher and the rush to the free global market. \"A whole new atmosphere came in then,\" he says. \"The old relationships between people broke down. Nothing mattered except the profit motive. It became the devil-take-the-hindmost society. This is a fundamental breakdown of everything that we know. We don't want to make a fortune, just a living. Yes, in one sense we're like the third world here.\" Malcolm's wagon arrives at the Malton slaughterhouse. It's a huge, grim-looking factory on an industrial estate with chimneys belching, tall tanks of blood, black gut, sludge and effluent, and that lingering smell of fresh death. We queue up on the concrete yard with wagons from Lincolnshire, Norfolk and Northumberland, each with 150 or more pigs. Malton used to kill 8,000 pigs a day, now it's 6,000. They are signed in by a Mr McCarthy and Malcolm helps unload them. Within the hour, they will be gassed and on their way to being a traditional British breakfast or pie. Tomorrow, he'll bring more in from elsewhere; next week Grant and Mark will get a cheque for more than \u00a37,000 but will be \u00a31,120 poorer and the whole pig cycle will go on. Except that in a few weeks he and his family will decide whether or not to chuck the whole lot in.",

      "bodyText": "The government yesterday warned British Telecom not to interfere with next week's auction of licences for the third generation of mobile phones. BT has written to the department of trade and industry reportedly threatening legal action to halt the auction because the rules have been changed. The Radiocommunications Agency, which is conducting the auction, originally ruled that there could only be one bid per group. But it has decided to allow Vodafone and Orange to make separate bids following Vodafone's \u00a3103bn takeover of Orange's parent, Mannesmann. A DTI spokesman said: \"We have received a letter from BT and it is up to BT to decide what to do. But it would not be in the interest of BT, or anyone else, to delay the auction.\" He said the auction, which starts on Monday, would be the world's first for a third generation mobile network, and would put Britain \"at the forefront of the world's telecom market\". He said that if Vodafone and Orange succeeded in the bidding they would not be granted licences until Orange had been sold off. A BT spokesman said: \"We have written to the DTI about the unfairness of the current arrangements whereby both Vodafone and Orange will be allowed to bid. \"We now know that the auction will start on Monday and that our representations have not been accepted.\" He refused to confirm that the group was considering legal action, though he admitted it was an option. The government is auctioning five licences, at least one of which will go to a new entrant to the market. It is expected to raise well over its \u00a3500m reserve price. Thirteen companies have applied to take part. The third generation phones will be able to receive email, music, high quality pictures, video and video conferencing. Most handsets will include a screen and a keyboard. Licence winners will have to spend several billion pounds building new networks, which are not expected to come into operation until at least 2002.",

As comeback kids go, Archer believes he is world champion.</p> <p>Archer's life has been a succession of extraordinary escapades and unlikely escapes. That cliffhanging capacity to survive the trickiest situations appeals to many who accept that he is a rogue but demur from following Crick and Paul Foot, who has exposed many of his fabrications, in declaring him a villain. What his supporters forget is that the crises are usually of his own making: like Houdini, he knowingly ties the knots and locks the chains that bind him.</p> <p>Wily politicians like Lord Whitelaw, who warned Margaret Thatcher he was \"an accident waiting to happen\", and Steven Norris, who believed from the beginning that he would have to withdraw from the mayoral race, recognised that he was a political liability. But friends always seemed to outnumber foes. It was ridiculous that, after the exposure of his deceptions and the Anglia share scandal in 1994, he became Tory candidate for mayor, but his sheer desire to do the job and the party's post-meltdown lack of direction allowed him to win the nomination.</p> <p>Archer is like a pint-sized Citizen Kane: he believes in himself so utterly and has mythologised his life so completely that he is able to get away with anything. Just as he is nailed, he wriggles free and begins again. His first great disaster saw him resign as a Conservative MP in 1974 after investing in a fraudu lent Canadian company: he fought back to become a bestselling novelist and, as he likes to boast, to repay all his debts within seven years. \"I can't expect people to have trust and respect for a man who has behaved so stupidly,\" he said at the time of his resignation. \"But that doesn't mean I'm now going to crawl away and hide. I will be fighting back.\"</p> <p>He fought back again in 1986, when the News of the World exposed his willingness to pay \u00a32,000 to Monica Coghlan, a prostitute he insisted he had never met. Archer had spent the early 80s restoring his fortunes in the Conservative Party and had risen to be its deputy chair man; now his \"foolishness\" forced him to resign. But again he came back, winning \u00a3500,000 in damages in his celebrated libel action against the Daily Star. The Daily Star is now promising a re-run.</p> <p>He won, but it was a tainted victory and, although he continued to have Thatcher's admiration, he did not return to party office immediately. Instead, he toured the constituencies relentlessly, enhanced his fortunes as a novelist (in 1990, he signed a $30m deal with HarperCollins for three books) and raised money to help the Kurds (he claimed to have raised \u00a357m; others put the figure at \u00a33.8m). His rehabilitation plan worked perfectly: the trial was forgotten (except by tormentors like Crick and Foot), the bogus CV was forgiven, he was given a peerage in 1992 and he was tipped for the Tory party chairmanship.</p> <p>It was the high point of his career, but once again disaster struck: he was involved, with a friend, in the purchase of shares in Anglia TV, which rose in the midst of takeover fever. The problem was that Mary was a director of the TV company, leaving him open to accusations of insider trading. He strenuously denied them, apologised to his wife (a familiar refrain), and was investigated by the DTI. The latter found him innocent of insider dealing, but the damage was done.</p> <p>\"I'm never sure of what my 10-year-old will be up to next,\" Jeffrey Archer's mother, Lola, wrote in her weekly column in the Weston Mercury in 1951. It could still be said of Archer, who will be 60 next month. Mary, the eternally loyal wife, often talks of him as if he were a naughty boy, the fresh-faced sprinting champion she met and married at Oxford in the 60s. He has been running ever since, though nobody knows quite why. He never appears to have any interest in ideology or policy, only in the Trollopian great game of politics.</p> <p>If he is Kane, we have yet to find his Rosebud. Like Kane he manages to be both attractive and deplorable: we admire his energy even though it is usually misdirected. He has perhaps now passed from condemnation to self-parody. The ad hominem attacks on his new book of short stories, To Cut a Long Story Short, seem unnecessary: he is too easy a target, a symptom of the cheapening of political life rather than its cause. That he should be attempting one last comeback - using all his famed public relations skills, drawing on the well of self-belief that has sustained him since his childhood - is surely more ludicrous than dangerous. The great actor finally finds his stage. You decide.</p>",

That cliffhanging capacity to survive the trickiest situations appeals to many who accept that he is a rogue but demur from following Crick and Paul Foot, who has exposed many of his fabrications, in declaring him a villain. What his supporters forget is that the crises are usually of his own making: like Houdini, he knowingly ties the knots and locks the chains that bind him. Wily politicians like Lord Whitelaw, who warned Margaret Thatcher he was \"an accident waiting to happen\", and Steven Norris, who believed from the beginning that he would have to withdraw from the mayoral race, recognised that he was a political liability. But friends always seemed to outnumber foes. It was ridiculous that, after the exposure of his deceptions and the Anglia share scandal in 1994, he became Tory candidate for mayor, but his sheer desire to do the job and the party's post-meltdown lack of direction allowed him to win the nomination. Archer is like a pint-sized Citizen Kane: he believes in himself so utterly and has mythologised his life so completely that he is able to get away with anything. Just as he is nailed, he wriggles free and begins again. His first great disaster saw him resign as a Conservative MP in 1974 after investing in a fraudu lent Canadian company: he fought back to become a bestselling novelist and, as he likes to boast, to repay all his debts within seven years. \"I can't expect people to have trust and respect for a man who has behaved so stupidly,\" he said at the time of his resignation. \"But that doesn't mean I'm now going to crawl away and hide. I will be fighting back.\" He fought back again in 1986, when the News of the World exposed his willingness to pay \u00a32,000 to Monica Coghlan, a prostitute he insisted he had never met. Archer had spent the early 80s restoring his fortunes in the Conservative Party and had risen to be its deputy chair man; now his \"foolishness\" forced him to resign. But again he came back, winning \u00a3500,000 in damages in his celebrated libel action against the Daily Star. The Daily Star is now promising a re-run. He won, but it was a tainted victory and, although he continued to have Thatcher's admiration, he did not return to party office immediately. Instead, he toured the constituencies relentlessly, enhanced his fortunes as a novelist (in 1990, he signed a $30m deal with HarperCollins for three books) and raised money to help the Kurds (he claimed to have raised \u00a357m; others put the figure at \u00a33.8m). His rehabilitation plan worked perfectly: the trial was forgotten (except by tormentors like Crick and Foot), the bogus CV was forgiven, he was given a peerage in 1992 and he was tipped for the Tory party chairmanship. It was the high point of his career, but once again disaster struck: he was involved, with a friend, in the purchase of shares in Anglia TV, which rose in the midst of takeover fever. The problem was that Mary was a director of the TV company, leaving him open to accusations of insider trading. He strenuously denied them, apologised to his wife (a familiar refrain), and was investigated by the DTI. The latter found him innocent of insider dealing, but the damage was done. \"I'm never sure of what my 10-year-old will be up to next,\" Jeffrey Archer's mother, Lola, wrote in her weekly column in the Weston Mercury in 1951. It could still be said of Archer, who will be 60 next month. Mary, the eternally loyal wife, often talks of him as if he were a naughty boy, the fresh-faced sprinting champion she met and married at Oxford in the 60s. He has been running ever since, though nobody knows quite why. He never appears to have any interest in ideology or policy, only in the Trollopian great game of politics. If he is Kane, we have yet to find his Rosebud. Like Kane he manages to be both attractive and deplorable: we admire his energy even though it is usually misdirected. He has perhaps now passed from condemnation to self-parody. The ad hominem attacks on his new book of short stories, To Cut a Long Story Short, seem unnecessary: he is too easy a target, a symptom of the cheapening of political life rather than its cause. That he should be attempting one last comeback - using all his famed public relations skills, drawing on the well of self-belief that has sustained him since his childhood - is surely more ludicrous than dangerous. The great actor finally finds his stage. You decide.",

      "bodyText": "As the Russian military declared that its battle for Chechnya was nearly complete, the president of the breakaway region, Aslan Maskhadov, vowed yesterday that the rebel army still had the power to mount a savage counter-offensive. Mr Maskhadov's threat came in response to the significant advances made by Russian forces into the mountainous region in the south of the state, a traditional rebel stronghold. The last major Chechen-held town, Shatoi, fell to the Russians earlier this week and soldiers were yesterday sweeping through the cave-ridden terrain around the town, searching for rebel bases. Fighters fleeing the area were said to be making their way back to the plains of northern Chechnya. That raised suspicions among the Russian military that scattered bands of rebels were planning to launch new raids on Russian-occupied regions - a tactic used with devastating success by Chechen fighters during the last war. But with the propaganda war raging in Moscow, it was hard to establish the strength of the beleaguered guerrilla forces or to determine how much control the Chechen army retained in the southern mountains. In a rare interview, Mr Maskhadov told a Moscow-based radio station that militants still held the Argun gorge, a strategically important canyon cutting through the mountains to the Georgian border. Conceding that Shatoi had been seized by the Russian army, he argued that rebels had never aimed to control villages but preferred to fight for the territory in between. But Russian army officials insisted that rebels held only four villages in the area and controlled just a few square miles in the entire region. The Chechen president also claimed still to have ample fighters. \"Out of 25,000 volunteers who took up arms, 23,000 remain. The fighting will go on for a long time,\" he said. Russian military officials claim that there are no more than 2,000 rebels still at large and said that about 500 of those were yesterday hemmed in by Russian troops as bitter fighting continued in nearby villages. An official Chechen rebel website also announced that fighters planned to push back the Russian advance into the mountains. \"Like eagles in the sky and like lions in the brush, the mojahedin are watching every move the Russians make,\" it said. \"They will soon pounce on the vodka army and will teach them once again why the mountains of Shatoi are described as the 'lion's den'.\" The same site, Jihad in Chechnya, listed the names and ranks of 96 Russian soldiers killed - according to Chechen officials - during the battle for Shatoi. But Sergei Yastrzhemsky, the spin doctor appointed to coordinate news on Russia's campaign, declared that he had evidence that the Chechen warlord Khattab was planning a new wave of terrorist attacks in major Russian towns. It was Russia's insistence that Chechen rebels were behind last September's bomb attacks that provided the government with crucial justification for its offensive. President Maskhadov also reiterated his willingness to negotiate to bring the conflict in Chechnya to a close. But the acting president, Vladimir Putin, responded that the only talks Russia was prepared to hold with him would be carried out by state prosecutors investigating criminal charges against him. Vadim Timchenko, the deputy commander of Russia's forces in the region, was even more blunt, commenting that Mr Maskhadov and other leading rebel commanders were being actively hunted down by the military. \"We are undertaking all means ... to destroy them,\" he said. International concern over allegations of severe human rights abuses by Russian troops in the region was discussed in Portugal yesterday. After meeting the Russian foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, in Lisbon, European Union officials said they would demand an independent investigation into alleged human rights abuses in Chechnya. Mr Ivanov later said he had granted permission for Mary Robinson, the UN high commissioner for human rights, to visit Moscow and the north Caucasus early next month. Moscow had previously refused Mrs Robinson's demand for access to the region, attacking what it described as her \"non-objective, biased and one-sided\" criticism of the brutality of Russia's campaign.",

Even Norman Lamont would find it hard to applaud a petty fraudster, one moreover who can never again leave Chile - the Spanish dossier remains open. The international enforcement of the claims of justice against human rights' abusers is a work in progress. Pinochet's arrest here 17 months ago remains a grand, precedent-setting event.",

The Republican frontrunner has also picked up the support of a number of actors. However, his ill-advised visit to Bob Jones university in South Carolina, the college where inter-racial dating is banned and Catholics are officially reviled, may have done some damage to his Hollywood rating. John McCain's autobiography, Faith of My Fathers, has already been optioned by USA Films and he has been fund-raising in LA as part of his \"Straight Talk Express\", with $1,000 (\u00a3600)-a-head private receptions and $250-a-head lunches at the Beverly Hills Hilton hotel with the assistance of actors such as Morgan Fairchild. Harrison Ford may well be the biggest name in the McCain camp, but the Vietnam veteran has also picked up support from the music mogul and Dreamworks studios partner Dave Geffen - who has also donated to Al Gore. Mr McCain is often referred to as a \"Bulworth\" Republican, a reference to Warren Beatty's 1998 film in which a politician who has arranged for his own murder starts to talk the truth for a change and finds his popularity soaring. Mr McCain is seen as closest to this image because he is someone who cannot be bothered to tiptoe round special interest groups. Mr Gore is benefiting from Hollywood's traditional association with the Democrats, although neither he nor Bill Bradley has aroused the affection or excitement that greeted George McGovern in his unsuccessful attempt in 1972.

However, Keith Burstein, 37, who says he lives a frugal lifestyle in order to compose, has to wait to learn whether he will have to pay his costs in bringing the action. The composer, who changed his style from modernist to \"romantic futurist\", had sued the newspaper after its diary column ran an item which he said was a \"straightforward lie\". He had feared the article would cause others in the music world to shun him, putting him out of work. Last night Mr Burstein, of London, said: \"I feel fully vindicated.

It said: \"The music is by Keith Burstein, an aggressively self-righteous, rather slushy composer who used to organise bands of hecklers to go about wrecking performances of modern atonal music, particularly anything by Sir Harrison Birtwistle.\" Mr Burstein sued over the allegation that he wrecked concerts. The jury settled on damages of \u00a38,000 after deliberating for three hours. Judge Richard Walker had already ruled that the article was libellous. The jury had not been allowed to hear, however, that Mr Burstein had been a member and co-founder of a group called the Hecklers, who had booed after a performance of Birtwistle's Gawain at Covent Garden. The judge struck out the Times's only line of defence - fair comment - in the absence of the jury. He said this evidence might have been relevant to a defence plea of justification, but no such defence had been pleaded, and he could not allow the Times to introduce it by the back door in an attempt to restrict the amount of damages it was liable to pay. Justin Rushbrooke, for the Times, submitted to the judge that because Mr Burstein had waited until the action started to claim that there was no defence of fair comment, the newspaper had wasted money gathering evidence, and he should make no order for costs.

Throughout, I have been keenly aware of the gravity of the crimes allegedly committed by Senator Pinochet, and of the desire for justice by those who suffered at the hands of the former Chilean regime. </p> <p>This has been an unprecedented case. Both I and the courts have had to navigate in uncharted territory. Two judicial committees of the House of Lords took different views about what offences constituted extradition crimes. More recently, Mr Justice Kay ruled that my refusal of Belgium's request for disclosure of the medical report which I had commissioned was correct: shortly afterwards a full divisional court, while acknowledging strong arguments on both sides, came to the opposite view. </p> <p>Senator Pinochet landed at Heathrow airport on 22 September 1998, for a private visit to the United Kingdom. </p> <p>On 16 October the Metropolitan police received an extradition request from a Madrid court for the provisional arrest of Senator Pinochet for serious offences including the murder of Spanish citizens. The police were advised by FCO officials that Senator Pinochet did not enjoy diplomatic immunity from arrest. </p> <p>The Bow Street magistrates court then issued a provisional arrest warrant and Senator Pinochet was arrested that evening. </p> <p>Senator Pinochet's solicitors made representations to me on 21 October 1998, asking me to cancel this provisional arrest warrant. I declined to do so on the basis that the issues raised at this stage were a matter for the court. They challenged my decision. </p> <p>A divisional court, headed by the lord chief justice, rejected that challenge and awarded me my costs. The court nevertheless quashed the warrant on the grounds that Senator Pinochet had sovereign immunity as a former head of state and that the warrant did not disclose an extradition crime. </p> <p>The crown prosecution service, acting on behalf of Spain, then entered an appeal to the House of Lords. In a unique feature of this case, the issue was considered twice by the House of Lords, first in November 1998 and then, after the first judgment was vacated, in March 1999. The key majority finding of the second court was that torture was an international crime over which the parties to the torture convention had universal jurisdiction and that a former head of state did not have immunity from such crimes. </p> <p>This ruling was a landmark judgment in human rights law, whose impact has been felt far beyond our shores. It will be a permanent legacy of the Pinochet case. </p> <p>I issued a second authority to proceed on 14 April 1999. A second judicial challenge by Senator Pinochet's representatives was again rejected by the divisional court. </p> <p>On 8 October 1999 Senator Pinochet was committed by the Bow Street magistrate to await my decision whether or not to extradite him to Spain. Senator Pinochet's solicitors applied for habeas corpus and a hearing date was set for 20 March this year. </p> <p>On 14 October, I received representations from the Chilean embassy, supported by medical reports, which suggested that there had been a recent and significant deterioration in Senator Pinochet's health. I commissioned a medical examination of Senator Pinochet. The report indicated that Senator Pinochet was unfit to stand trial and that no significant improvement could be expected. </p> <p>I informed the interested parties on 11 January that in the light of this medical evidence and subject to any representations received by 18 January, I was minded to conclude that no purpose would be served by continuing the Spanish extradition request. On 25 January a judicial review application was made by Belgium and Amnesty International for disclosure of the medical report. </p> <p>A judgment of 15 February said that I should disclose the report to Spain, Belgium, France and Switzerland only in terms of strict confidence. Requesting states were invited to make any representation on the medical report by Tuesday 22 February 2000. </p> <p>I considered the matter afresh in the light of all this material. Having done so, I was satisfied that the conclusion of the original report was correct. </p> <p>The principle that an accused person should be mentally capable of following the proceedings, instructing lawyers and giving coherent evidence is fundamental to the idea of a fair trial. The trial of an accused in the condition diagnosed in Senator Pinochet, on the charges which have been made against him in this case, could not be fair in any country, and would violate article 6 of the European convention on human rights. </p> <p>A number of representations which I received argued that even if there were questions about Senator Pinochet's fitness for trial, these should be determined in Spain and not here. I looked at this question with great care. However, I was advised and I concluded that on the basis of English law I was bound to form a view of my own on Senator Pinochet's fitness to stand trial and that I could not refrain from reaching such a view on the basis that the question could be determined in Spain. </p> <p>In any event, I established with the assistance of the Spanish authorities that their principles for determining the fitness of an accused to stand trial were similar to ours. I therefore concluded that given the advice that no improvement in Senator Pinochet's condition could be expected, no judicial purpose would have been served by the continuation of extradition proceedings for the objective of a trial in Spain which could not result in any verdict on the charges against him. </p> <p>Of the 70,000 letters and emails from the public which I have received from all over the world, and many letters from members of parliament and organisations, almost all have urged me to allow the extradition proceedings to take their course, so that the allegations made against Senator Pinochet could be tried. I attach great importance to the principle that universal jurisdiction against persons charged with international crimes should be effective. </p> <p>I am all too aware that the practical consequence of refusing to extradite Senator Pinochet to Spain is that he will probably not be tried anywhere. I am very conscious of the sense of injury which will be felt by those who suffered from breaches of human rights in Chile in the past, as well as their relatives. All of these are matters of great concern, and I had them very much in mind when considering the evidence about Senator Pinochet's state of health. </p> <p>They are among the reasons why I required the evidence of Senator Pinochet's condition to satisfy a high standard of expertise, thoroughness, objectivity and cogency before I was prepared to act on it. </p> <p>Ultimately, however, I was driven to the conclusion that a trial of the charges against Senator Pinochet, however desirable, was simply no longer possible.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Military helicopters buzzed over Santiago yesterday in practice runs for the high security operation that will transfer General Pinochet from an airport on the outskirts of the capital to a heavily guarded military hospital in the city centre.</p> <p>By 7am, preparations for the imminent return of Gen Pinochet were visible throughout Santiago. Many street corners were bedecked in Chilean flags in a show of patriotic support for the former commander in chief.</p> <p>His supporters drove in convoys around the city, honking their horns and screaming \"grandpa is coming home\".</p> <p>Chileans of all political views were glued to television sets or crowded around newspaper kiosks as the country prepared for what is expected to be a chaotic return.</p> <p>After 16 months' detention in London, the self-designated \"senator for life\" is expected to arrive in Santiago early this morning.</p> <p>But the Gen Pinochet who returns is very different from the confident and proud soldier who left 16 months ago. He has been widely humiliated in the international press and made a symbol by international human rights groups keen to pursue notorious dictators.</p> <p>Human rights groups in Chile, while saddened by the imminent return, were yesterday quick to define the episode as a positive advance for human rights.</p> <p>\"We don't have to be sad; quite the contrary, we have to feel that we have made an important step,\" said Viviana Diaz, president of Family Members of the Detained and Disappeared.</p> <p>\"We all know that Pinochet thought he was the untouchable, the invincible, one and that justice would never reach him.\"</p> <p>The president-elect, Ricardo Lagos, a Socialist who will take over the government on March 11, has repeatedly stressed that the Chilean courts must decide the future of Gen Pinochet.</p> <p>While many political analysts argue that the general's power and supporters are strong enough to block a trial in Chile, Mr Lagos this week insisted he could be tried in Chile. \"If that were not the case, it would mean that our democracy is castrated,\" he said.</p> <p>For Gen Pinochet to be tried in Chile, he must first be stripped of his senatorial privilege. A petition to that end is expected to be filed in the next 24 hours.</p> <p>Hugo Guttierez, a leading human rights lawyer in Chile, was poised to coordinate a legal attack the minute the former commander in chief landed in Chile. Mr Guttierez said yesterday that the investigating judge Juan Guzman is handling 59 separate criminal investigations of Gen Pinochet and that Chilean law makes no exception for the poor health of a defendant.</p> <p>Mr Guttierez also emphasised that he believed Gen Pinochet to be in far better health than was publicly admitted. \"This [decision by Straw] is nothing more than a cover for a political decision. The mental health problems don't exist. When Pinochet arrives in Chile, the public is going to see how he quickly recovers.\"</p> <p>Judge Guzman, who heads the Chilean investigation, will soon decide when Gen Pinochet will be forced to undergo fresh medical tests. Chilean law allows for exemption from prosecution only in cases of senility or dementia.</p> <p>Tension rose throughout the country yesterday in anticipation of the general's return. A BBC reporter was attacked by his supporters at the non-profit Pinochet Foundation, who shouted, \"colonialist\", \"imperialists\" and \"stupid gringo, go home\".</p> <p>Luis Cortes Villa, the director of the foundation, quickly broke up fights among supporters but expressed enthusiasm at the general's return. \"Justice has been done,\" he said. \"We are all very proud of General Pinochet for his strength. Thank God he could survive this whole process in London.\"</p> <p>It is still unclear whether Gen Pinochet will immediately be transferred to a military hospital in Santiago or hustled away to a military post in the desert to the north. But his presence in the country is sure to uncork street celebrations - billed by supporters as a carnival - as well as mournful protests and another round of national soul searching.</p> <p>Despite efforts by rightwing political parties to define the Pinochet arrest as an affront to national sovereignty, opinion polls in Chile indicate that 60% of the public want him put on trial here.</p> <p>Jack Straw's decision was widely interpreted as a victory for the outgoing Chilean president, Eduardo Frei, who had long promised to bring Gen Pinochet home before March 10 - the end of his six-year term.</p> <p>After frustrated attempts to convince the British judicial system that the general, as a special ambassador or a former head of state, was immune from prosecution, the administration switched strategies.</p> <p>Led by the foreign minister, Juan Gabriel Valdes, the Chileans began to argue last December that Gen Pinochet's deteriorating health made him unfit for trial in Spain. That argument eventually prevailed, although the political capital spent in defending the former dictator has cost the ruling Christian Democrat government heavily.</p> <p>After Mr Straw's announcement that Gen Pinochet had been freed, Mr Valdes described the entire Pinochet affair as a \"disgusting\" episode in the country's history.</p> <p>He added: \"The primary person responsible for this event is the person who maintained a lack of respect for international politics - Augusto Pinochet.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Military helicopters buzzed over Santiago yesterday in practice runs for the high security operation that will transfer General Pinochet from an airport on the outskirts of the capital to a heavily guarded military hospital in the city centre. By 7am, preparations for the imminent return of Gen Pinochet were visible throughout Santiago. Many street corners were bedecked in Chilean flags in a show of patriotic support for the former commander in chief. His supporters drove in convoys around the city, honking their horns and screaming \"grandpa is coming home\". Chileans of all political views were glued to television sets or crowded around newspaper kiosks as the country prepared for what is expected to be a chaotic return. After 16 months' detention in London, the self-designated \"senator for life\" is expected to arrive in Santiago early this morning. But the Gen Pinochet who returns is very different from the confident and proud soldier who left 16 months ago. He has been widely humiliated in the international press and made a symbol by international human rights groups keen to pursue notorious dictators. Human rights groups in Chile, while saddened by the imminent return, were yesterday quick to define the episode as a positive advance for human rights. \"We don't have to be sad; quite the contrary, we have to feel that we have made an important step,\" said Viviana Diaz, president of Family Members of the Detained and Disappeared. \"We all know that Pinochet thought he was the untouchable, the invincible, one and that justice would never reach him.\" The president-elect, Ricardo Lagos, a Socialist who will take over the government on March 11, has repeatedly stressed that the Chilean courts must decide the future of Gen Pinochet. While many political analysts argue that the general's power and supporters are strong enough to block a trial in Chile, Mr Lagos this week insisted he could be tried in Chile. \"If that were not the case, it would mean that our democracy is castrated,\" he said. For Gen Pinochet to be tried in Chile, he must first be stripped of his senatorial privilege. A petition to that end is expected to be filed in the next 24 hours. Hugo Guttierez, a leading human rights lawyer in Chile, was poised to coordinate a legal attack the minute the former commander in chief landed in Chile. Mr Guttierez said yesterday that the investigating judge Juan Guzman is handling 59 separate criminal investigations of Gen Pinochet and that Chilean law makes no exception for the poor health of a defendant. Mr Guttierez also emphasised that he believed Gen Pinochet to be in far better health than was publicly admitted. \"This [decision by Straw] is nothing more than a cover for a political decision. The mental health problems don't exist. When Pinochet arrives in Chile, the public is going to see how he quickly recovers.\" Judge Guzman, who heads the Chilean investigation, will soon decide when Gen Pinochet will be forced to undergo fresh medical tests. Chilean law allows for exemption from prosecution only in cases of senility or dementia. Tension rose throughout the country yesterday in anticipation of the general's return. A BBC reporter was attacked by his supporters at the non-profit Pinochet Foundation, who shouted, \"colonialist\", \"imperialists\" and \"stupid gringo, go home\". Luis Cortes Villa, the director of the foundation, quickly broke up fights among supporters but expressed enthusiasm at the general's return. \"Justice has been done,\" he said. \"We are all very proud of General Pinochet for his strength. Thank God he could survive this whole process in London.\" It is still unclear whether Gen Pinochet will immediately be transferred to a military hospital in Santiago or hustled away to a military post in the desert to the north. But his presence in the country is sure to uncork street celebrations - billed by supporters as a carnival - as well as mournful protests and another round of national soul searching. Despite efforts by rightwing political parties to define the Pinochet arrest as an affront to national sovereignty, opinion polls in Chile indicate that 60% of the public want him put on trial here. Jack Straw's decision was widely interpreted as a victory for the outgoing Chilean president, Eduardo Frei, who had long promised to bring Gen Pinochet home before March 10 - the end of his six-year term. After frustrated attempts to convince the British judicial system that the general, as a special ambassador or a former head of state, was immune from prosecution, the administration switched strategies. Led by the foreign minister, Juan Gabriel Valdes, the Chileans began to argue last December that Gen Pinochet's deteriorating health made him unfit for trial in Spain. That argument eventually prevailed, although the political capital spent in defending the former dictator has cost the ruling Christian Democrat government heavily. After Mr Straw's announcement that Gen Pinochet had been freed, Mr Valdes described the entire Pinochet affair as a \"disgusting\" episode in the country's history. He added: \"The primary person responsible for this event is the person who maintained a lack of respect for international politics - Augusto Pinochet.\"",

The battle to bring the former Chilean dictator to justice, culminating in the law lords' ruling a year ago opening the way for his prosecution, has put the entire international regime of human rights law on an established footing. The old doctrines of sovereign immunity, under which former heads of state were immune from criminal action at the behest of authorities in foreign states, and \"act of state\" - which means that the courts of one state will not question the legality of official acts by another - have given way to the emerging international law principle of individual responsibility for crimes against humanity. When Gen Pinochet first went to the high court to challenge the arrest warrant issued against him at Spain's request, the answer seemed simple. Three judges held that the doctrines of sovereign immunity and act of state gave the former Chilean dictator complete immunity from prosecution. The House of Lords ruled that he could stand trial, by the narrow margin of three to two. But the lords overturned their own ruling when it emerged that Lord Hoffmann, one of the majority, had links with Amnesty International. The final judgment by a rarely convened panel of seven law lords gave the go-ahead for prosecution by six to one. The law lords held that the general could be prosecuted in Britain or extradited to stand trial under British acts of parliament that gave effect to our obligations under international treaties. The judgment, probably the most momentous Britain's highest court has ever delivered, now stands as a key precedent in international law throughout the world. It confirms that the whole edifice of international treaties and national laws set up to ensure that those, even at the highest level, who commit crimes against humanity have no hiding place is not just a well-meaning gesture. Former dictators will have to think twice before setting foot in any of the many countries that have signed up to international treaties on torture and hostage-taking, and the case stands as a warning to those tempted to commit such crimes in future.

      "body": "<p>Sighs of relief could be heard echoing down the corridors of power in London, Santiago and Madrid yesterday as Augusto Pinochet took his final, faltering steps on British soil and boarded a Chilean airforce jet at RAF Waddington.</p> <p>His departure signals the end of a 17-month diplomatic and legal nightmare for the governments of Britain, Chile and Spain, during which the general, once an almost forgotten pariah reviled by the left and loved by the right, has been cast centre stage in the debate on how the international community should deal with leaders who break the norms of civilised behaviour.</p> <p>The victims and families of Pinochet's torture squads will have found yesterday's events hard to bear, but no doubt the civil servants, pragmatic to the last, will have raised a glass to the general, wishing him godspeed on his final journey home. Nowhere more so than in Madrid, where the government has found itself caught up in a spiralling diplomatic disaster that began when Baltasar Garzon - a crusading prosecutor with little regard for the diplomatic niceties that usually govern international relations - issued a warrant for Pinochet's arrest in October 1998.</p> <p>Pinochet's lawyers fought the case all the way to the House of Lords, claiming, without success, that the general was entitled to immunity as a former head of state. But where the law could not save him from the dock of a Spanish court, his health, perhaps perversely, could.</p> <p>While there is no reason to doubt that the final decision to end the extradition proceedings against Pinochet on medical grounds was taken in isolation by Jack Straw, acting in his quasi judicial role, it is also the case that the home secretary is not impervious to pressures from other departments. The foreign office in particular has been exercised by the possible ramifications of the case.</p> <p>Diplomatic relations with Chile have been stretched, almost to breaking point, by the general's detention, while the affair produced a warning blip on the radar screens in the foreign office which suggested it could blow up to affect Britain's relations with much of South America.</p> <p><b> Colonialism</b><br></p> <p>Britain's trade links with Chile are negligible in real terms, but Pinochet's detention offended many governments in the region, who saw his arrest as Spain, and by default Britain, imposing a form of moral colonialism on Chile. Santiago's insistence that the general should only be tried in Chile was met with sympathy and support in other South American capitals. Argentina, whose General Galtieri is also on the list of former dictators Judge Garzon wants to see in the dock, vociferously supported the Chilean government.</p> <p>The beginning of the end of the saga came last June when Robin Cook met Abel Matutes, the Spanish foreign minister, in secret during a summit in Rio of European and South American countries. Amid rumours of the ageing general's ailing health the two men reached an agreement. \"I will not let him die in Britain,\" the foreign secretary reportedly told his Spanish counterpart. \"I will not let him come to Spain,\" Mr Matutes responded.</p> <p>But it was not until September that a solution to the affair presented itself. Over a cup of tea in a tiny room of the UN building in New York, Mr Cook met the Chilean foreign minister, Juan Gabriel Valdes. Mr Valdes surprised the foreign secretary by turning around the well-rehearsed argument that the Pinochet case was having a detrimental effect on the two countries' relations, instead concentrating on the general's health. The die was cast. It was now just a matter of time.</p> <p>The home office was briefed by the foreign office, which later passed on representations from the Chilean embassy supported by medical reports suggesting there had been a recent and significant deterioration in Pinochet's condition and that he might be unfit to stand trial.</p> <p>The request to send him home on humanitarian grounds came less than a month after a new Chilean ambassador, Pablo Cabrera, arrived in London. He was sent by the president, Eduardo Frei, with one instruction: \"Bring Pinochet home.\"</p> <p>Mr Cabrera's predecessor, Mario Artaza, who in private was reduced almost to tears by having to defend a man he despised, steadfastly refused to go anywhere near Pinochet's rented mansion on the Wentworth estate in Surrey. But Mr Cabrera brought a more pragmatic approach to the affair.

      "bodyText": "Sighs of relief could be heard echoing down the corridors of power in London, Santiago and Madrid yesterday as Augusto Pinochet took his final, faltering steps on British soil and boarded a Chilean airforce jet at RAF Waddington. His departure signals the end of a 17-month diplomatic and legal nightmare for the governments of Britain, Chile and Spain, during which the general, once an almost forgotten pariah reviled by the left and loved by the right, has been cast centre stage in the debate on how the international community should deal with leaders who break the norms of civilised behaviour. The victims and families of Pinochet's torture squads will have found yesterday's events hard to bear, but no doubt the civil servants, pragmatic to the last, will have raised a glass to the general, wishing him godspeed on his final journey home. Nowhere more so than in Madrid, where the government has found itself caught up in a spiralling diplomatic disaster that began when Baltasar Garzon - a crusading prosecutor with little regard for the diplomatic niceties that usually govern international relations - issued a warrant for Pinochet's arrest in October 1998. Pinochet's lawyers fought the case all the way to the House of Lords, claiming, without success, that the general was entitled to immunity as a former head of state. But where the law could not save him from the dock of a Spanish court, his health, perhaps perversely, could. While there is no reason to doubt that the final decision to end the extradition proceedings against Pinochet on medical grounds was taken in isolation by Jack Straw, acting in his quasi judicial role, it is also the case that the home secretary is not impervious to pressures from other departments. The foreign office in particular has been exercised by the possible ramifications of the case. Diplomatic relations with Chile have been stretched, almost to breaking point, by the general's detention, while the affair produced a warning blip on the radar screens in the foreign office which suggested it could blow up to affect Britain's relations with much of South America. Colonialism Britain's trade links with Chile are negligible in real terms, but Pinochet's detention offended many governments in the region, who saw his arrest as Spain, and by default Britain, imposing a form of moral colonialism on Chile. Santiago's insistence that the general should only be tried in Chile was met with sympathy and support in other South American capitals. Argentina, whose General Galtieri is also on the list of former dictators Judge Garzon wants to see in the dock, vociferously supported the Chilean government. The beginning of the end of the saga came last June when Robin Cook met Abel Matutes, the Spanish foreign minister, in secret during a summit in Rio of European and South American countries. Amid rumours of the ageing general's ailing health the two men reached an agreement. \"I will not let him die in Britain,\" the foreign secretary reportedly told his Spanish counterpart. \"I will not let him come to Spain,\" Mr Matutes responded. But it was not until September that a solution to the affair presented itself. Over a cup of tea in a tiny room of the UN building in New York, Mr Cook met the Chilean foreign minister, Juan Gabriel Valdes. Mr Valdes surprised the foreign secretary by turning around the well-rehearsed argument that the Pinochet case was having a detrimental effect on the two countries' relations, instead concentrating on the general's health. The die was cast. It was now just a matter of time. The home office was briefed by the foreign office, which later passed on representations from the Chilean embassy supported by medical reports suggesting there had been a recent and significant deterioration in Pinochet's condition and that he might be unfit to stand trial. The request to send him home on humanitarian grounds came less than a month after a new Chilean ambassador, Pablo Cabrera, arrived in London. He was sent by the president, Eduardo Frei, with one instruction: \"Bring Pinochet home.\" Mr Cabrera's predecessor, Mario Artaza, who in private was reduced almost to tears by having to defend a man he despised, steadfastly refused to go anywhere near Pinochet's rented mansion on the Wentworth estate in Surrey. But Mr Cabrera brought a more pragmatic approach to the affair. His first task was to visit the general to outline the new approach. Despite being surrounded by sycophantic supporters, loneliness was said to be making Pinochet severely depressed. That and suddenly being forced to spend long hours with his wife, something he had studiously avoided for much of his married life. His only real contact with the outside world came through the three special branch officers who spent every waking hour either in the next room or accompanying Pinochet during his brief sojourns in the mansion's garden. According to the new Chilean ambassador, the man he found at Wentworth in September was a shadow of the general who had ruled Chile for 17 years with an iron fist. Unable to concentrate for more than a few minutes, Pinochet seemed to have no idea why he was under arrest. Last rites There was some hostility among the general's close advisers to the \"health\" option. Their interests conflicted with those of the Chilean government. For Mr Frei and his centre-left coalition the doomsday scenario was Pinochet dying in Britain: the old general returning to Santiago in a coffin would immediately grant Pinochet martyr status.

Entry into the UK: in brief \u0095 The home office rejected MI5 demands that the black American singer Paul Robeson be banned from Britain in 1958: \"Paul Robeson may be a communist but he is also a great artist and a world figure. To turn him out of the country or to refuse him entry would create a major crisis,\" the official file on the performer said. \u0095 MI5 branded the Cambridge philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein a communist sympathiser because he stayed with the Marxist economist Maurice Dobb when he first arrived in Britain from his native Austria. In fact Wittgenstein was a leading intellectual critic of Marxism between the wars. \u0095 The French entertainer Maurice Chevalier was banned from undertaking a \u00a31,000 a week music hall tour in Britain after the war. Chevalier had regularly performed in Paris during the Nazi occupation but a French investigation had cleared him of collaboration. \u0095 Four Romanov relatives of the last Russian tsar who fled to Britain pleaded poverty when the home office demanded that they should each pay the usual \u00a310 fee when their naturalisation cases were processed in 1938. A letter to the home office on behalf of King George VI about the case said the king was devoted to the Grand Duchess Xenia and her family but they were living at Hampton Court palace where they were \"very badly off\". The home office did waive the fees; however, the civil servant working on the case added a sarcastic note to the file: \"I must arrange a flag day at Hampton Court for them.\"",

Her birth certificate states her life began in Newcastle under Lyme on November 18, 1885. She was given the title by the Guinness Book of Records after it rejected a Dominican woman claiming to be 125. Britain also has the world's oldest man, Harry Halford, born on June 15, 1891 in Leicester where he still lives, though his title is also disputed, from Japan. Mrs Morris worked as a domestic help in Stafford. She was widowed in the 1930s and her only child. Winnie, died of cancer in 1975, aged 62. Only when she got a chest infection at 107 did Mrs Morris leave her flat and enter the Autumn House nursing home in Stone. A friend, Margaret Moult, said that Mrs Morris, who is deaf and partially sighted, had replied \"Oh! am I?\" when told by nurses of her fame. According to Mrs Moult, Mrs Morris attributes her long life to work, exercise, boiled onions and a daily tot of whisky with her cup of tea. \"She used to enjoy a cigarette and rode a bicycle, but she's never had a day's illness apart from chest infections, which are down to old age,\" Mrs Moult said. Elizabeth Israel of Dominica claims she was born on January 27, 1875 but has no birth certificate, although other documents may be accepted. If so, she would be the oldest person ever; the past holder, Jeane Louise Calment, died in 1986 at 122. Guinness World Records is waiting confirmation that Sadayoshi Tanabe of Kawasaki was born in 1889.",

But the final bill is not as high as claimed by the general's supporters - who have argued that the spiralling cost to the taxpayer was as good a reason as any to halt the extradition proceedings. Estimates of the expenditure that will have to be met by the British authorities have ranged as high as \u00a317m, but a detailed analysis shows that the true figure is less than half that amount. By far the most expensive element of the case has been the estimated \u00a34m it has cost to protect the general, who has spent much of his incarceration under armed police guard at a rented mansion on the Wentworth estate in Surrey. A team of special branch detectives, reputedly costing more than \u00a370,000 a week, have guarded the general round the clock to prevent him from breaking his bail conditions as well as guard him from would- be attackers.

The crown prosecution service, which has been acting on behalf of Spain and is obliged under European law to pay the costs incurred in the UK, has spent under just over half a million pounds on the case. Jack Straw has relied heavily on a team of treasury solicitors plotting a course through the legal minefield, spending just under \u00a3200,000, although after Belgium's successful judicial review of the home secretary's decision not to release the medical reports that figure is likely to be much higher.

He also tells us everything else about his journey to Venezuela to fulfil a four-year-old promise to Tapir to take him to England. </p> <p>Perhaps this is the problem. The more David talks about Tapir's experience, the more Tapir himself remains an enigma, never more so than in the odd semi-musical sequence which forms the centrepiece of this documentary. Tapir on a sofa in Ticehurst, East Sussex watching Teletubbies. Tapir at the zoo. Tapir at a medieval pageant. Tapir playing golf. Tapir eating fish and chips. The aforementioned Tapir/Daltrey scene. Tapir stony-faced and lost-looking at a Who concert. England looks frighteningly trashy. </p> <p>We seem to find out a lot about Goodale, a likeable, self-deprecating soul with an obvious enthusiasm for his subject, but rather less about Tapir, his tense, slight figure bowed under the weight of Goodale's anxious determination to explain his experiences in voiceover. </p> <p>There are revealing moments when the camera is (almost) allowed to speak for itself.

Here Goodale stands back a bit and we see Tapir giving away his newly-acquired goods and explaining his own experiences through photographs to the other villagers, relaxed and animated in a way he never was during the postcard experiences Goodale orchestrated for him, in control of the narrative for once. </p> <p>There is a sense of muddle about Pipe Dreams; part of it seems to want to be a humorous video diary - about Goodale's ineptitude in the rainforest, a sweaty middle-aged white man deserted by porters, about his mock- heroic battle with Venezuelan bureaucracy to obtain a passport for Tapir. Part of it is striving to tell us something about Tapir and his people. But the chance to listen and observe is somehow lost under the flow of Goodale's well-meaning chatter. </p> <p>Back at <strong> Holby City </strong> (BBC1), things seem a bit soggy after the departure of the supremely improbable consultant, Mr Jordan, in a sports car and a cloud of self-righteousness. The Casualty-esque love of didactic plot mirroring made for a rather tortured storyline involving Dr Kirstie surprising (the commendably irritable) Dr Tash in the loo poking at a breast lump. Cue admission of lady with breast cancer, who has recently had a miscarriage and whose husband turns out to be having an affair with her GP. There was some moral here somewhere, because Dr Tash eventually made an appointment to have her lump checked out and the husband was revealed as immature and rejected by both wife and GP. The rival plot involved the blonde doctor making concerned goldfish faces at Sammy-the-Brick, a boxer with a dodgy ticker and an even dodgier manager who was trying to make him carry on fighting. Even the wooden-faced urbanity of the excellent Mr Meyer (\"How long have you been a pugilist?\") couldn't resuscitate this one, although he did get to do a very fine bit of eyebrow acting when asked by the dodgy manager, \"What if you got it wrong?\" Sacrilege. It may be that the departure of Mr Jordan leaves some space for Old Woody to expand his character into a third dimension. But not this week. </p> <p>Mr Barratt, still as sensitive and long of chin as he was in his Casualty days, got the jolly filler plot.

Surrounded by two marked police Volvos, a Range Rover and two motorcycle outriders, Gen Pinochet's bullet-proof Volkswagen Sharan headed on to the A30, before picking up the A1 and speeding north to RAF Waddington in Lincolnshire, where the general's plane had been waiting since 6am. Its engines were started at 12.43pm, as soon as the convoy swept onto base, and at 1.14 it was airborne. Only aircraft buffs formed a ragged farewell party in the pouring rain. Charlie Perks, 47, who owns a mobile caravan park by the base, commented: \"I would have expected some protesters here given all the fuss, but it was deadly quiet. The police cars flew past and I tried to get a glimpse through the tinted windows but couldn't see Pincochet - it was a bit disappointing I suppose.\"",

If the channel was forced to revert to its original programming, it would have less advertising and would enter a vicious circle of \"less spending on programmes, less quality, less home grown programmes\", Mr Hill told the committee.</p> <p>He acknowledged that viewers would take time to become used to the change, claiming his wife still sometimes turned on the television expecting news at 10pm. But he told Mr Kaufman: \"This is an exercise which may take up to three years.

Following the changes, the channel's advertising revenue has risen by \u00a3100m, of which \"at least \u00a350m, and perhaps as much as \u00a370m\" were down to moving the news bulletins, Mr Hill told MPs. Committee chairman Gerald Kaufman, quoting ITC viewing figures, said: \"For the gain of advertising of \u00a3100m, which obviously means a great deal to you, you've thrown away 2m viewers.\" ITV concedes that audiences for its Nightly News programme at around 11pm are lower than it hoped at, around 3.2m. Mr Hill admitted that the quality of programmes leading up to the new bulletin had not been \"sufficiently successful\" to guarantee a strong inherited audience. The scheduling and the flexible timing of the programme had also been a problem, he told MPs. ITV managers point to a 300,000 rise in viewers tuning into uninterrupted sports coverage and films at 10pm, a figure rising to 721,000 since the autumn schedule started last September. They claim scheduling changes were essential to halt a continuing slide in evening audiences and advertising revenues. If the channel was forced to revert to its original programming, it would have less advertising and would enter a vicious circle of \"less spending on programmes, less quality, less home grown programmes\", Mr Hill told the committee. He acknowledged that viewers would take time to become used to the change, claiming his wife still sometimes turned on the television expecting news at 10pm. But he told Mr Kaufman: \"This is an exercise which may take up to three years. We still believe that, if we get the programming right between 7pm and 11pm, we will get a bigger audience for the Nightly News.\"",

      "body": "<p>Jim Bailey, who has died aged 80, was an originator of Drum, the South African-based magazine founded in 1951, and became its inspiration, its most active promoter, and, almost immediately, its sole financier. After early issues, it was not reaching the African readership for which it was intended. It was a white man's magazine for black men's eyes, and was not working. \"Your tribal music,\" Jim realised, had to become \"our music\". Forget kraals, folktales, and patronising, if well-meaning, talk of the African. Instead, bring in jazz, girls, boxers, and the cruelties of apartheid.</p> <p>Drum then took off, ably edited by Anthony Sampson. \"Mr Drum\" was its in-house hero, usually a most courageous staffer named Henry Nxumulo, who exposed farms where flogging was rife, or where payment was made in alcohol. He even went deliberately to jail, enabling a photographer to acquire (from a nearby rooftop) proof of indignities meted out to inmates.</p> <p>The magazine quickly became the voice of black unrest, of segregated misery, of political aspiration. Of course, it was there to record the 1960 Sharpeville massacre, when a protest rally ended with 56 dead and 162 wounded, all shot by the police.</p> <p>In continuing to finance the magazine, Jim Bailey made serious dents in the fortune he had inherited from his father, Sir Abe Bailey, the Johannesburg gold millionaire. With Drum so often pilloried in many quarters, a similar erosion might have reduced the courage he inherited from his mother, an aviation pioneer who flew solo from London to Cape Town in 1928, returning the following year via western Africa. His upbringing in South Africa was certainly untypical, with parents often absent and a father possibly more interested in his racehorses than his own bloodstock.</p> <p>That father, worrying distantly about the turmoil in Europe, wrote anxiously in May 1937 to his friend, the then chancellor of the exchequer Neville Chamberlain, only to be told that the situation was \"exasperating . . . but we must not take it too seriously\". \"This fatuous sentiment,\" wrote Jim, when using it as a frontispiece for a book of his wartime poems, \"was the death warrant for nearly all my friends and some 50m people.\"</p> <p>Educated at Winchester and Oxford, Bailey joined the Royal Air Force as a pilot in September 1939. During the Battle of Britain he served with 264 Squadron, and then with 85 Squadron, from which 25 (out of 37) pilots were killed. Peter Townsend was also a survivor of that unit, and a pilot more respected by Jim than any other, writing a foreword to one of his books.</p> <p>Bailey initially flew the Defiant, with a rear-facing gun turret, a fighter which \"flew forwards and shot backwards\", but - in his opinion - was never properly used. Then he switched to Hurricanes, flying at night over Britain's burning cities, though without radar to help him find the enemy. Finally, it was the formidable twin-engined Beaufighter, which suited him very well. When moving up Italy, in the final stages of the war, he took a hive of bees with him to ensure good honey.</p> <p>The war ate increasingly into him the further it regressed in time. In particular, he remembered a fellow pilot, Gordon, who experienced engine trouble when both were returning from a foray over Norway. Slowly, Jim watched as the other plane flew nearer and nearer to the sea, and the image seared into his brain. His wartime poems are savage in their repressed blatancy.</p> <p>\"Young, blond, teenage airgunner/ whom I saw in a Lincoln bar/ whose beauty held me captive/ whom I worshipped from afar:/ the cannon shells of a nightfighter/ neither see nor spare,/ and when his kite got home one night,/ they took a hose and washed him/ down from his turret chair.\"</p> <p>When Drum had been successfully launched, with an extraordinary, multi-talented bunch - largely from the soon-to-be destroyed Sophiatown - Jim attempted to make it continental and established offices in the rest of Africa. I took over the western section, based myself loosely (in the back of a truck) within Ghana and Nigeria, and sold the magazine to a rapacious readership, eager for this very African production.</p> <p>Jim was often a companion, loving it when locals asked if he knew the boss - his clothes and manner causing their mistake. He also saw them buy even single pages, their appetite so acute, and dreamed of a continent-wide publication. To help this longing he met presidents, ministers, journalists, musicians and great quantities of potential readership.</p> <p>Alas, Africa got in the way of his dream. Its distances were too huge, its roads and railways too often temporary. Worse, a Nigerian is not noticeably interested in Sudanese or Zambian affairs - any more than, or even less than, the average Briton cares for Finnish or Turkish politics.</p> <p>Jim poured money into the magazine. He sold his huge inherited farm in the Karroo, and started other journals to bolster Drum's finances. But his precious publication was often banned, its crusading style even less welcome in the new nations than in the old South Africa. In the end, bit by bit, it had to go.</p> <p>His other passion was a conviction - based on tremendous scholarship - that the new world, notably its southern section, had been visited from Europe, long before Columbus ever made the journey further north. The tin for the Bronze Age came largely, or so he argued, from the Amazon basin. Countless statues had Negro faces. Numerous legends told of the old-new world interaction. Coins and inscriptions had been found.</p> <p>As a consequence of this obsession - which he detailed in his books The God-Kings and Titans - Bailey was no more in favour of hidebound historians unwilling to change their views than he was of repressive governments, or of wartime blunderers (whom he blamed for Gordon's death) - or, indeed, of Neville Chamberlain. But to friends he was terrific, with a laugh that went rolling down the street, and with stories of idiocy or excellence. There will be multi- coloured thousands in Africa who will mourn the passing of this very special man.</p> <p>He married Barbara Epstein in 1962. She and four children survive him.</p> <p><b>Cameron Duodu writes: </b> In 1960, while South Africa's apartheid government was mowing down Africans at Sharpeville, I was an editor in the Ghana Broadcasting Corporation's newsroom. One day I was told that Jim Bailey wanted to see me.</p> <p>Now, Drum was fascinating. While it was possible to dismiss the paper as a lightweight publication that used titillation to win a wide readership - it always had a beautiful girl on the cover - titillation was, in fact, Drum's camouflage. Perhaps the most famous picture ever published in Africa was its photograph of black South African prisoners being forced into a naked \"tausa\" dance - to ensure that they had hidden nothing in their rectums.</p> <p>Ghana's edition of Drum was nothing like as adventurous but, under editor Henry Ofori, its incisiveness had led President Kwame Nkrumah to ban it. But I went to see Jim Bailey.</p> <p>What I didn't expect was the nature of the man. He was dressed in khaki shorts that looked slept in, and a shirt whose sleeves had been rolled up to the shoulder - like a New York waterfront teamster. His blonde hair and large, expressive face also stood out. But it was when he opened his mouth that all preconceived notions collapsed. He had a foghorn voice, and an accent that mixed Oxford, Yorkshire, Cockney and South African. He belonged to two worlds - the curse-infected polo ground on the South African veldt, and the 1941 RAF officers' mess. There was also the restraining influence of the boardrooms of those companies whose shares had been bequeathed to him by his Cecil Rhodes-type father.</p> <p>Bailey had a loud, head-thrown-back, attention-grabbing laugh that exploded out of him. The laugh featured whether he was sipping a beer in a dingy Lagos nightclub, a Johannesburg shebeen or a svelte hotel dining-room.</p> <p>\"I want you to join Drum,\" he told me. I said I would. But then came talk about money. Bailey never touched the subject himself, and I was reduced to sending him messages through Christian Gbagbo, a photographer whom Drum was to make famous. After a lot of to-ing and fro-ing, Christian came back with the message: \"He will pay what you want, but if, after three months, you do not justify your pay, then you and Drum will part company.\"</p> <p>I was expected to leave a sheltered civil service job to work under such conditions. I did. And although I was to learn that Drum agreeing to pay, and actually paying, could take quite a number of days, I stayed with the company for five years.</p> <p>It was a delicious time. The crafty Bailey had neglected to tell me that Ofori had left and that I, aged 23, was to be the new editor - this, in a political atmosphere so charged that Ofori had thought it wise to remove himself to the United States. But I didn't regret it, for through Drum I became a frontline Pan-Africanist.</p> <p>I travelled to Nigeria to meet my counterpart there, Nelson Ottah; I went to Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) and on from there to interview Sir Roy Welensky, then second only to Hendrik Verwoerd as a villain in the eyes of black Africa. In Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia (now Harare, Zimbabwe), I made a lifelong friend in Noel Mukono, also of Drum. I was his guest as plans were made by himself and other associates to split from Joshua Nkomo's Zapu and form Zanu, Zimbabwe's ruling party. I also interviewed two of Africa's (then) heroes: Jomo Kenyatta and Hastings Banda.</p> <p>Bailey was an ideal employer for a journalist. If the story was good, you rode high - though your expenses would be queried all the same. \"Every employee,\" he told me, \"aspires to make his employer pay for him to have a bloody good holiday while pretending to work.\"</p> <p>The one unmistakable impression I got from Bailey was that he regarded every human being as his equal (despite his money) and that he judged individuals by their performance. He hated humbug, thus his excessively informal style.</p> <p>There was, however, a dark side. He liked to suggest stories that portrayed Africa as stuck in a time-warp. One I resisted was a deftly thrown hint that cannibalism was part of the process of achieving power in Sierra Leone and Liberia. He also saw the troubles in the Congo and other African disaster areas not as the inevitable consequence of imposing foreign rule on a people and leaving them to compete, without rules, for resources, but as a throwback to Africa's atavistic past. I never ceased to argue with him; the last time, in 1990, we had a six-hour session, watered by good Cape wine, in the study at his beautiful farmhouse in Lanseria, South Africa.</p> <p>Bailey was not afraid to put his thoughts, however outlandish, on paper. F As In Flight (1961) gave an inkling, in verse, of what it was like to be a 19-year-old RAF fighter pilot. The Sky Suspended (1990) developed the ideas he had gathered on war, whilst participating. And, in Sailing To Paradise (1995), he explored his eccentric ideas about the cultural affinities of coasts - from West Africa to the Inca coast.</p> <p>Bailey once told me a story that may serve as his epitaph: a farmer once took in a young, very rich city dweller as a paying guest. For his first dinner, he gave instructions to the farmer's wife as follows: \"I want the juiciest steak from your best cow, your best potatoes, your finest mushrooms and the tenderest beans and cabbage from your vegetable beds. Don't worry if you have to disturb your routine of harvesting crops to get them for me - cost will be no object.\" The farmer, who had been listening from an adjoining room, shouted back at the city slicker: \"And I'll buy the muck off you.\"</p> <p>I can still hear Bailey laughing uproariously at his own joke. Across Africa, many an ear will be the poorer for the silencing of that laugh.</p> <p><b> Jonathan Glancey adds </b>: The first time I really got to know and love Jim Bailey was playing Cardinal Puff, an absurd, wartime RAF drinking game into the small, very drunken hours, in an air-conditioned burger joint in the Fourways shopping mall on the fringe of Johannesburg. Why ex-Squadron Leader JFC Bailey, DFC, chose to drink in this sanitised eaterie, must remain a puzzle. As must this Olympian \"himself\" to those who find it hard to imagine how one man can have lived so many lives, crossed so many historic paths.</p> <p>Jim must have drunk in every shebeen worth its name from Kampala to Cape Town, despite being born into a stupendously wealthy family, his father a Randlord, crony of Cecil Rhodes and financial backer of Winston Churchill in his wilderness years. He played polo at Kirtlington Park, fished and shot with the gamekeeper, Alan Howe, on the family estate at Bletchington, yet the drum of Africa was the soundtrack of his mature life. Black Africa got under his ghost-white skin. He settled there for good in 1946.</p> <p>In publishing Drum, Jim shaped the first black African magazine and, being the man he was, he went to meet his public - a 5m readership at its peak - in tin shacks and hot alleyways, hearing stories first-hand and finding writers for his editors in the same stews. His was a powerful intellect - his books on Bronze Age civilisations are wonderful. He was sardonic, stubborn, very grand and wickedly funny. But no snob. With Jim you had no idea who might pop by for breakfast at his farm, whether Nelson Mandela or one of the few of the first writers and photographers who survived Drum.</p> <p>In 1990s London we went dancing at the Metropolitan Grand until four in the morning. The young women, black and white, adored him. He had great charm and looked in those last years like a cross between an old hippy and an Old Testament prophet.</p> <p>It was hard to get close to Jim. He was scared of love. He was bloody lucky to have found Barbara Epstein, his second wife, a talented pianist who loved him through roller-coaster years and was the only woman, his extraordinary Anglo-Irish mother aside, to have had his measure. He is lucky to leave such talented children and step-children.</p> <p>He wrote beautifully - poetry, history, his wartime memoirs. He was shot by a Junkers 88, threatened with death, survived an assasination attempt in South Africa and lived to see the apartheid he hated come apart and Mandela, an old friend, in power.</p> <p>At Easter 1939, he hitch-hiked through the Austrian Alps with some pals. They fell in with Luftwaffe pilots. Jim hated the idea that they would soon be killing one another to satisfy the perverse desires of racist politicians. Jim was able to make a friend of anyone who could tell a joke, spin a yarn, stop him from being bored.</p> <p>Here's Jim at his delicious best, transcribed from my slightly drunken scrawl: \"In its heyday, Drum had no rival. An attempt was made by some black Americans to launch a magazine. They flew around Africa by first-class jet, staying in smart hotels, while we drank with locals in shebeens. Because they were black, they thought they understood Africa better than the rest of us, black and white together. It didn't work, which, for your fun, reminds me of a story told me in Ghana of the wealthy black American businessman who visits Africa in search of his roots.</p> <p>\"He meets the chief who, standing on his dignity, will only talk to him through the witch doctor. The American says how happy he is to be in the land of his forebears. The witch doctor says the chief says he is happy too. The American says his heart leaps to be back among his own people. The witch doctor explains, looking rather sheepish, that the chief's heart leaps too. But, what the chief really said was \"Here's a rich American, let's strip him!\" I think that's the situation the chaps found themselves in. A black skin alone doesn't an African make\". Head thrown back, Jim howls like a hyena.</p> <p>James Richard Abe Bailey. magazine publisher, author, historian, poet, born October 23 1919; died February 29 2000</p>",

      "bodyText": "Jim Bailey, who has died aged 80, was an originator of Drum, the South African-based magazine founded in 1951, and became its inspiration, its most active promoter, and, almost immediately, its sole financier. After early issues, it was not reaching the African readership for which it was intended. It was a white man's magazine for black men's eyes, and was not working. \"Your tribal music,\" Jim realised, had to become \"our music\". Forget kraals, folktales, and patronising, if well-meaning, talk of the African. Instead, bring in jazz, girls, boxers, and the cruelties of apartheid. Drum then took off, ably edited by Anthony Sampson. \"Mr Drum\" was its in-house hero, usually a most courageous staffer named Henry Nxumulo, who exposed farms where flogging was rife, or where payment was made in alcohol. He even went deliberately to jail, enabling a photographer to acquire (from a nearby rooftop) proof of indignities meted out to inmates. The magazine quickly became the voice of black unrest, of segregated misery, of political aspiration. Of course, it was there to record the 1960 Sharpeville massacre, when a protest rally ended with 56 dead and 162 wounded, all shot by the police. In continuing to finance the magazine, Jim Bailey made serious dents in the fortune he had inherited from his father, Sir Abe Bailey, the Johannesburg gold millionaire. With Drum so often pilloried in many quarters, a similar erosion might have reduced the courage he inherited from his mother, an aviation pioneer who flew solo from London to Cape Town in 1928, returning the following year via western Africa. His upbringing in South Africa was certainly untypical, with parents often absent and a father possibly more interested in his racehorses than his own bloodstock. That father, worrying distantly about the turmoil in Europe, wrote anxiously in May 1937 to his friend, the then chancellor of the exchequer Neville Chamberlain, only to be told that the situation was \"exasperating . . . but we must not take it too seriously\". \"This fatuous sentiment,\" wrote Jim, when using it as a frontispiece for a book of his wartime poems, \"was the death warrant for nearly all my friends and some 50m people.\" Educated at Winchester and Oxford, Bailey joined the Royal Air Force as a pilot in September 1939. During the Battle of Britain he served with 264 Squadron, and then with 85 Squadron, from which 25 (out of 37) pilots were killed. Peter Townsend was also a survivor of that unit, and a pilot more respected by Jim than any other, writing a foreword to one of his books. Bailey initially flew the Defiant, with a rear-facing gun turret, a fighter which \"flew forwards and shot backwards\", but - in his opinion - was never properly used. Then he switched to Hurricanes, flying at night over Britain's burning cities, though without radar to help him find the enemy. Finally, it was the formidable twin-engined Beaufighter, which suited him very well. When moving up Italy, in the final stages of the war, he took a hive of bees with him to ensure good honey. The war ate increasingly into him the further it regressed in time. In particular, he remembered a fellow pilot, Gordon, who experienced engine trouble when both were returning from a foray over Norway. Slowly, Jim watched as the other plane flew nearer and nearer to the sea, and the image seared into his brain. His wartime poems are savage in their repressed blatancy. \"Young, blond, teenage airgunner/ whom I saw in a Lincoln bar/ whose beauty held me captive/ whom I worshipped from afar:/ the cannon shells of a nightfighter/ neither see nor spare,/ and when his kite got home one night,/ they took a hose and washed him/ down from his turret chair.\" When Drum had been successfully launched, with an extraordinary, multi-talented bunch - largely from the soon-to-be destroyed Sophiatown - Jim attempted to make it continental and established offices in the rest of Africa. I took over the western section, based myself loosely (in the back of a truck) within Ghana and Nigeria, and sold the magazine to a rapacious readership, eager for this very African production. Jim was often a companion, loving it when locals asked if he knew the boss - his clothes and manner causing their mistake. He also saw them buy even single pages, their appetite so acute, and dreamed of a continent-wide publication. To help this longing he met presidents, ministers, journalists, musicians and great quantities of potential readership. Alas, Africa got in the way of his dream. Its distances were too huge, its roads and railways too often temporary. Worse, a Nigerian is not noticeably interested in Sudanese or Zambian affairs - any more than, or even less than, the average Briton cares for Finnish or Turkish politics. Jim poured money into the magazine. He sold his huge inherited farm in the Karroo, and started other journals to bolster Drum's finances. But his precious publication was often banned, its crusading style even less welcome in the new nations than in the old South Africa. In the end, bit by bit, it had to go. His other passion was a conviction - based on tremendous scholarship - that the new world, notably its southern section, had been visited from Europe, long before Columbus ever made the journey further north. The tin for the Bronze Age came largely, or so he argued, from the Amazon basin. Countless statues had Negro faces. Numerous legends told of the old-new world interaction. Coins and inscriptions had been found. As a consequence of this obsession - which he detailed in his books The God-Kings and Titans - Bailey was no more in favour of hidebound historians unwilling to change their views than he was of repressive governments, or of wartime blunderers (whom he blamed for Gordon's death) - or, indeed, of Neville Chamberlain. But to friends he was terrific, with a laugh that went rolling down the street, and with stories of idiocy or excellence. There will be multi- coloured thousands in Africa who will mourn the passing of this very special man. He married Barbara Epstein in 1962. She and four children survive him. Cameron Duodu writes: In 1960, while South Africa's apartheid government was mowing down Africans at Sharpeville, I was an editor in the Ghana Broadcasting Corporation's newsroom. One day I was told that Jim Bailey wanted to see me. Now, Drum was fascinating. While it was possible to dismiss the paper as a lightweight publication that used titillation to win a wide readership - it always had a beautiful girl on the cover - titillation was, in fact, Drum's camouflage. Perhaps the most famous picture ever published in Africa was its photograph of black South African prisoners being forced into a naked \"tausa\" dance - to ensure that they had hidden nothing in their rectums. Ghana's edition of Drum was nothing like as adventurous but, under editor Henry Ofori, its incisiveness had led President Kwame Nkrumah to ban it. But I went to see Jim Bailey. What I didn't expect was the nature of the man. He was dressed in khaki shorts that looked slept in, and a shirt whose sleeves had been rolled up to the shoulder - like a New York waterfront teamster. His blonde hair and large, expressive face also stood out. But it was when he opened his mouth that all preconceived notions collapsed. He had a foghorn voice, and an accent that mixed Oxford, Yorkshire, Cockney and South African. He belonged to two worlds - the curse-infected polo ground on the South African veldt, and the 1941 RAF officers' mess. There was also the restraining influence of the boardrooms of those companies whose shares had been bequeathed to him by his Cecil Rhodes-type father. Bailey had a loud, head-thrown-back, attention-grabbing laugh that exploded out of him. The laugh featured whether he was sipping a beer in a dingy Lagos nightclub, a Johannesburg shebeen or a svelte hotel dining-room. \"I want you to join Drum,\" he told me. I said I would. But then came talk about money. Bailey never touched the subject himself, and I was reduced to sending him messages through Christian Gbagbo, a photographer whom Drum was to make famous. After a lot of to-ing and fro-ing, Christian came back with the message: \"He will pay what you want, but if, after three months, you do not justify your pay, then you and Drum will part company.\" I was expected to leave a sheltered civil service job to work under such conditions. I did. And although I was to learn that Drum agreeing to pay, and actually paying, could take quite a number of days, I stayed with the company for five years. It was a delicious time. The crafty Bailey had neglected to tell me that Ofori had left and that I, aged 23, was to be the new editor - this, in a political atmosphere so charged that Ofori had thought it wise to remove himself to the United States. But I didn't regret it, for through Drum I became a frontline Pan-Africanist. I travelled to Nigeria to meet my counterpart there, Nelson Ottah; I went to Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) and on from there to interview Sir Roy Welensky, then second only to Hendrik Verwoerd as a villain in the eyes of black Africa. In Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia (now Harare, Zimbabwe), I made a lifelong friend in Noel Mukono, also of Drum. I was his guest as plans were made by himself and other associates to split from Joshua Nkomo's Zapu and form Zanu, Zimbabwe's ruling party. I also interviewed two of Africa's (then) heroes: Jomo Kenyatta and Hastings Banda. Bailey was an ideal employer for a journalist. If the story was good, you rode high - though your expenses would be queried all the same. \"Every employee,\" he told me, \"aspires to make his employer pay for him to have a bloody good holiday while pretending to work.\" The one unmistakable impression I got from Bailey was that he regarded every human being as his equal (despite his money) and that he judged individuals by their performance. He hated humbug, thus his excessively informal style. There was, however, a dark side. He liked to suggest stories that portrayed Africa as stuck in a time-warp. One I resisted was a deftly thrown hint that cannibalism was part of the process of achieving power in Sierra Leone and Liberia. He also saw the troubles in the Congo and other African disaster areas not as the inevitable consequence of imposing foreign rule on a people and leaving them to compete, without rules, for resources, but as a throwback to Africa's atavistic past. I never ceased to argue with him; the last time, in 1990, we had a six-hour session, watered by good Cape wine, in the study at his beautiful farmhouse in Lanseria, South Africa. Bailey was not afraid to put his thoughts, however outlandish, on paper. F As In Flight (1961) gave an inkling, in verse, of what it was like to be a 19-year-old RAF fighter pilot. The Sky Suspended (1990) developed the ideas he had gathered on war, whilst participating. And, in Sailing To Paradise (1995), he explored his eccentric ideas about the cultural affinities of coasts - from West Africa to the Inca coast. Bailey once told me a story that may serve as his epitaph: a farmer once took in a young, very rich city dweller as a paying guest. For his first dinner, he gave instructions to the farmer's wife as follows: \"I want the juiciest steak from your best cow, your best potatoes, your finest mushrooms and the tenderest beans and cabbage from your vegetable beds. Don't worry if you have to disturb your routine of harvesting crops to get them for me - cost will be no object.\" The farmer, who had been listening from an adjoining room, shouted back at the city slicker: \"And I'll buy the muck off you.\" I can still hear Bailey laughing uproariously at his own joke. Across Africa, many an ear will be the poorer for the silencing of that laugh. Jonathan Glancey adds : The first time I really got to know and love Jim Bailey was playing Cardinal Puff, an absurd, wartime RAF drinking game into the small, very drunken hours, in an air-conditioned burger joint in the Fourways shopping mall on the fringe of Johannesburg. Why ex-Squadron Leader JFC Bailey, DFC, chose to drink in this sanitised eaterie, must remain a puzzle. As must this Olympian \"himself\" to those who find it hard to imagine how one man can have lived so many lives, crossed so many historic paths. Jim must have drunk in every shebeen worth its name from Kampala to Cape Town, despite being born into a stupendously wealthy family, his father a Randlord, crony of Cecil Rhodes and financial backer of Winston Churchill in his wilderness years. He played polo at Kirtlington Park, fished and shot with the gamekeeper, Alan Howe, on the family estate at Bletchington, yet the drum of Africa was the soundtrack of his mature life. Black Africa got under his ghost-white skin. He settled there for good in 1946. In publishing Drum, Jim shaped the first black African magazine and, being the man he was, he went to meet his public - a 5m readership at its peak - in tin shacks and hot alleyways, hearing stories first-hand and finding writers for his editors in the same stews. His was a powerful intellect - his books on Bronze Age civilisations are wonderful. He was sardonic, stubborn, very grand and wickedly funny. But no snob. With Jim you had no idea who might pop by for breakfast at his farm, whether Nelson Mandela or one of the few of the first writers and photographers who survived Drum. In 1990s London we went dancing at the Metropolitan Grand until four in the morning. The young women, black and white, adored him. He had great charm and looked in those last years like a cross between an old hippy and an Old Testament prophet. It was hard to get close to Jim. He was scared of love. He was bloody lucky to have found Barbara Epstein, his second wife, a talented pianist who loved him through roller-coaster years and was the only woman, his extraordinary Anglo-Irish mother aside, to have had his measure. He is lucky to leave such talented children and step-children. He wrote beautifully - poetry, history, his wartime memoirs. He was shot by a Junkers 88, threatened with death, survived an assasination attempt in South Africa and lived to see the apartheid he hated come apart and Mandela, an old friend, in power. At Easter 1939, he hitch-hiked through the Austrian Alps with some pals. They fell in with Luftwaffe pilots. Jim hated the idea that they would soon be killing one another to satisfy the perverse desires of racist politicians. Jim was able to make a friend of anyone who could tell a joke, spin a yarn, stop him from being bored. Here's Jim at his delicious best, transcribed from my slightly drunken scrawl: \"In its heyday, Drum had no rival. An attempt was made by some black Americans to launch a magazine. They flew around Africa by first-class jet, staying in smart hotels, while we drank with locals in shebeens. Because they were black, they thought they understood Africa better than the rest of us, black and white together. It didn't work, which, for your fun, reminds me of a story told me in Ghana of the wealthy black American businessman who visits Africa in search of his roots. \"He meets the chief who, standing on his dignity, will only talk to him through the witch doctor. The American says how happy he is to be in the land of his forebears. The witch doctor says the chief says he is happy too. The American says his heart leaps to be back among his own people. The witch doctor explains, looking rather sheepish, that the chief's heart leaps too. But, what the chief really said was \"Here's a rich American, let's strip him!\" I think that's the situation the chaps found themselves in. A black skin alone doesn't an African make\". Head thrown back, Jim howls like a hyena. James Richard Abe Bailey. magazine publisher, author, historian, poet, born October 23 1919; died February 29 2000",

The Australian government said the joint operation with Britain, which involved the relocation of 300,000 cubic metres (399,000 cubic yards) of plutonium-contaminated topsoil in the remote outback site in the south Australian desert, is now over. Australia's federal resources minister, Nick Minchin, said that the \u00a343m rehabilitation of the outback site, which was used to test British nuclear weapons between 1952 and 1963, had been completed on time and within budget. He also said that the land was now safe for the traditional owners, the Maralinga Tjarutja people, to travel and hunt across the three former test sites of Taranaki, TMS and Wewak. But 120 sq km (46 sq miles) around Taranaki are still considered too contaminated to allow for continual habitation. \"The nuclear tests at Maralinga were a legacy of a time when Australians appreciated neither the importance of the land to its traditional Aboriginal owners, nor the value of our continent's diverse environment,\" said Senator Minchin during a visit to the region on Wednesday. \"The Maralinga Rehabilitation Project is a clear symbol that those times have passed.\" Maralinga, which in the Aboriginal language means \"thunder\", once housed hundreds of British scientists and service personnel involved in tests the largest of which had a yield of 25 kilotons. A royal commission in the 1980s heard evidence that aborigines had been poisoned by a large black cloud which followed some of the weapons' tests. After long discussions between the two governments the commission's findings led to the ambitious clean-up operation. The aboriginal people's administrator, Archie Barton, said the community would continue to regard the area with caution and was working with the state and federal government to ensure the return of all the Maralinga lands to their traditional owners. \"We have submitted a business plan to the federal government for the Maralinga village to make it a resource centre, because education remains the key,\" he said.

Malcolm Ferguson, 23, a paroled drug-dealer, was killed only a few hundred yards from where four white officers shot dead Amadou Diallo, a black street-trader, just over a year ago - an event which has become a touchstone in the debate over the price to be paid for slashing crime figures. About 100 demonstrators squared up to police in the Bronx after the latest shooting, which came five days after the officers who fired 41 shots at Diallo - hitting him 19 times - were cleared of all charges against them, including murder. Ferguson, who was shot in the head by a narcotics officer in the Bronx, had been arrested in the protests that followed last week's verdicts. \"Clearly we want answers,\" said Ruben Diaz Jr, a state assembly member for New York City borough. \"It's amazing how this just happened after this community just dealt with the Diallo shooting.\" But there were differences between the two cases.

Only hours after Ferguson's death, Diallo's parents and the Rev Al Sharpton, the black activist, were in Washington lobbying the justice department. They want federal criminal charges to be filed against the four officers, in line with the precedent set when Los Angeles policemen were acquitted of the notorious beating of Rodney King. But legal experts believe it is unlikely that another trial would be successful, because the prosecution would have to prove that the officers wilfully deprived Diallo of a right protected by the constitution.

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>In the foodie lexicon there can be few more oxymoronic phrases than \"Jewish cuisine\". It suggests refinement. It suggests delicacy. It suggests a whole bunch of things that Jewish food has rarely ever met, let alone been on nodding terms with. Jews joke about it. Here's the definition of Jewish keep-fit lessons: you eat three bowls of chicken soup with matzo balls, put your hand on your chest and say, \"Feel the burn.\" That's how delicate Jewish food is. Today, the only place you are likely to find anything approaching real Jewish cuisine is in the home of the Cohen family of Paris. It will be where they do the cooking.</p> <p>This, of course, is all a little unfair. Granted, chopped liver and gefillte fish, latkas, salt beef and bagels - what we in Britain and much of America take to be Jewish food - are to light, healthy eating what Slobodan Milosevic is to the Nobel Peace Prize. But they are only a part of the Jewish food story. Like everything else where Jews are concerned - politics, the observance of the religion, the quickest way to drive from Golders Green to Edgware - there are always splits and differences of opinion.</p> <p>The fact is that what we think of as Jewish food in Britain is only the cooking of the Ashkenazi, the Jews of Germany and eastern Europe, from where much of the community in this country originates. Despite the density of the actual dishes that comprise it, the Ashkenazi culinary canon is actually rather a thin, etiolated affair compared to the extraordinary cookery of the Sephardi Jews, who come from the Iberian peninsula, the Mediterranean and the Middle East.</p> <p>On Sunday I will sit down before a Jewish Book Week audience, alongside the Jewish cookery writers Claudia Roden, Evelyn Rose and Judy Jackson, and we will try to decide whether there really is still such a thing as Jewish food. Doubtless there will be disagreement. (It is said that if you put two Jews in a room you get three opinions; put 100 Jews in a room and Oi!, but the noise.) A lot of people there will, I'm sure, bemoan what they see both as the vulgarisation and the eclipsing of the great standards of Jewish food in Britain, as the younger generation increasingly turns away from the religious observances and the commands of the laws of Kashruth upon which almost all of Jewish cookery is based.</p> <p>Their concerns are undoubtedly fair. Great changes have taken place. Four years ago Bloom's of Whitechapel in London's east end was forced to close down after the Beth Din, the Jewish rabbinical court, withdrew its kosher licence. It was certainly the right time. The Jews of the east end had long ago fled the grime of Commercial Road for the peace and privet of the suburbs. Last year the old restaurant's managing director, Michael Bloom, himself moved a little west to Farringdon and set up a new salt beef bar, only this time without a kosher licence. It was too much hassle to have one and anyway his new City-worker clientele didn't care whether a rabbi had muttered over their lunch or not. (The other branch of Bloom's in Golders Green is still in business.)</p> <p>At the same time as Bloom's left the east end a few of the staples of Ashkenazi food have left behind their roots and undergone a kind of New York-ification. They have become simply a part of the mainstream, without any reference whatsoever to their religious-cultural beginnings. Pret a Manger now sells a pastrami and dill pickle sandwich alongside its BLTs. Frozen oven-cook latkas are available at Tesco. British Midland Airways serves smoked salmon and cream cheese bagels as a snack on its internal flights. Bagel bars like Bagel Express are popping up on every corner - and you can be certain the company's original business plan made no reference to a guaranteed clientele based on the size of London's Jewish community. Sure, there is Ashkenazi food out there but it's hardly what you'd call authentic</p> <p>Yet this is only half the story, because while Ashkenazi food is in, if not decline, then a curious state of flux, Sephardi food is booming. This is hardly surprising. The roster of Ashkenazi dishes grew up as a direct response to the privations of life in the shtetls. As a result it's generally about as light and fluffy as, ooh, whipped lead. Pickling a good lump of beef in brine may not be the most elegant method of food preparation, but it's a fair way to preserve animal proteins through the long eastern European winters.</p> <p>Sephardi food, by contrast, is light and sunny. It's about grilled meats and cous cous, marinated vegetables and humus, stuffed peppers and roast aubergines and, like the Sephardi Jews themselves, comes from all points of the compass: Iran and Iraq, Morocco and Spain, Turkey and Syria and Egypt. It is, in short, so very much more in tune with Britain's increasingly eclectic tastes than Ashkenazi comfort food could ever be. And so while Blooms in Whitechapel closes, a new restaurant like Kinneret in Edgware opens, offering a wide menu of Sephardi dishes.</p> <p>Perhaps the most telling development is the recent appearance of what is, by any definition, Sephardi cooking on non-Kosher restaurant menus, even if it doesn't flaunt itself as such. In London the rise of achingly hip eateries like Momo and Moro, Tajine and Souk, Midi and the estimable Sofra Cafe chain have made it increasingly difficult to escape the influence, and therefore the tastes, of the Jewish Mediterranean. By contrast in the nine months since I took over as the Observer's restaurant critic, I have not once been offered a dish that came even close to being a witty re-interpretation of Ashkenazi food. Boeuf sal\u00e9 en crte , anybody? I don't think so.</p> <p>The interest here in the food of North Africa and the Middle East mirrors a major change that has occurred in the eating habits of Israelis. When it was founded in 1948, Israel was a strangely European country, somehow transplanted to the Levant, because that was the background of most of the Jews who first settled there. Hence the majority of its restaurants were classically Ashkenazi.</p> <p>In recent years, however, a massive influx of Jews both from the Middle East and North Africa has led to a sudden growth in the Sephardi population. With it has come the food. It is now about as easy to find a bowl of chicken soup with knaidlach in Tel Aviv as it is a bag of pork scratchings. Instead, it's all schwarma kebabs, falafel and humus. Is it likely that this shift in Israel - the Levantathising of the country, if you like - has had no impact on what British Jews are eating? I doubt it.</p> <p>The Jewish mothers of Britain may well find all this change very unnerving, but they can at least take comfort from one unalterable truth.

      "bodyText": "In the foodie lexicon there can be few more oxymoronic phrases than \"Jewish cuisine\". It suggests refinement. It suggests delicacy. It suggests a whole bunch of things that Jewish food has rarely ever met, let alone been on nodding terms with. Jews joke about it. Here's the definition of Jewish keep-fit lessons: you eat three bowls of chicken soup with matzo balls, put your hand on your chest and say, \"Feel the burn.\" That's how delicate Jewish food is. Today, the only place you are likely to find anything approaching real Jewish cuisine is in the home of the Cohen family of Paris. It will be where they do the cooking. This, of course, is all a little unfair. Granted, chopped liver and gefillte fish, latkas, salt beef and bagels - what we in Britain and much of America take to be Jewish food - are to light, healthy eating what Slobodan Milosevic is to the Nobel Peace Prize. But they are only a part of the Jewish food story. Like everything else where Jews are concerned - politics, the observance of the religion, the quickest way to drive from Golders Green to Edgware - there are always splits and differences of opinion. The fact is that what we think of as Jewish food in Britain is only the cooking of the Ashkenazi, the Jews of Germany and eastern Europe, from where much of the community in this country originates. Despite the density of the actual dishes that comprise it, the Ashkenazi culinary canon is actually rather a thin, etiolated affair compared to the extraordinary cookery of the Sephardi Jews, who come from the Iberian peninsula, the Mediterranean and the Middle East. On Sunday I will sit down before a Jewish Book Week audience, alongside the Jewish cookery writers Claudia Roden, Evelyn Rose and Judy Jackson, and we will try to decide whether there really is still such a thing as Jewish food. Doubtless there will be disagreement. (It is said that if you put two Jews in a room you get three opinions; put 100 Jews in a room and Oi!, but the noise.) A lot of people there will, I'm sure, bemoan what they see both as the vulgarisation and the eclipsing of the great standards of Jewish food in Britain, as the younger generation increasingly turns away from the religious observances and the commands of the laws of Kashruth upon which almost all of Jewish cookery is based. Their concerns are undoubtedly fair. Great changes have taken place. Four years ago Bloom's of Whitechapel in London's east end was forced to close down after the Beth Din, the Jewish rabbinical court, withdrew its kosher licence. It was certainly the right time. The Jews of the east end had long ago fled the grime of Commercial Road for the peace and privet of the suburbs. Last year the old restaurant's managing director, Michael Bloom, himself moved a little west to Farringdon and set up a new salt beef bar, only this time without a kosher licence. It was too much hassle to have one and anyway his new City-worker clientele didn't care whether a rabbi had muttered over their lunch or not. (The other branch of Bloom's in Golders Green is still in business.) At the same time as Bloom's left the east end a few of the staples of Ashkenazi food have left behind their roots and undergone a kind of New York-ification. They have become simply a part of the mainstream, without any reference whatsoever to their religious-cultural beginnings. Pret a Manger now sells a pastrami and dill pickle sandwich alongside its BLTs. Frozen oven-cook latkas are available at Tesco. British Midland Airways serves smoked salmon and cream cheese bagels as a snack on its internal flights. Bagel bars like Bagel Express are popping up on every corner - and you can be certain the company's original business plan made no reference to a guaranteed clientele based on the size of London's Jewish community. Sure, there is Ashkenazi food out there but it's hardly what you'd call authentic Yet this is only half the story, because while Ashkenazi food is in, if not decline, then a curious state of flux, Sephardi food is booming. This is hardly surprising. The roster of Ashkenazi dishes grew up as a direct response to the privations of life in the shtetls. As a result it's generally about as light and fluffy as, ooh, whipped lead. Pickling a good lump of beef in brine may not be the most elegant method of food preparation, but it's a fair way to preserve animal proteins through the long eastern European winters. Sephardi food, by contrast, is light and sunny. It's about grilled meats and cous cous, marinated vegetables and humus, stuffed peppers and roast aubergines and, like the Sephardi Jews themselves, comes from all points of the compass: Iran and Iraq, Morocco and Spain, Turkey and Syria and Egypt. It is, in short, so very much more in tune with Britain's increasingly eclectic tastes than Ashkenazi comfort food could ever be. And so while Blooms in Whitechapel closes, a new restaurant like Kinneret in Edgware opens, offering a wide menu of Sephardi dishes. Perhaps the most telling development is the recent appearance of what is, by any definition, Sephardi cooking on non-Kosher restaurant menus, even if it doesn't flaunt itself as such. In London the rise of achingly hip eateries like Momo and Moro, Tajine and Souk, Midi and the estimable Sofra Cafe chain have made it increasingly difficult to escape the influence, and therefore the tastes, of the Jewish Mediterranean. By contrast in the nine months since I took over as the Observer's restaurant critic, I have not once been offered a dish that came even close to being a witty re-interpretation of Ashkenazi food. Boeuf sal\u00e9 en crte , anybody? I don't think so. The interest here in the food of North Africa and the Middle East mirrors a major change that has occurred in the eating habits of Israelis. When it was founded in 1948, Israel was a strangely European country, somehow transplanted to the Levant, because that was the background of most of the Jews who first settled there. Hence the majority of its restaurants were classically Ashkenazi. In recent years, however, a massive influx of Jews both from the Middle East and North Africa has led to a sudden growth in the Sephardi population. With it has come the food. It is now about as easy to find a bowl of chicken soup with knaidlach in Tel Aviv as it is a bag of pork scratchings. Instead, it's all schwarma kebabs, falafel and humus. Is it likely that this shift in Israel - the Levantathising of the country, if you like - has had no impact on what British Jews are eating? I doubt it. The Jewish mothers of Britain may well find all this change very unnerving, but they can at least take comfort from one unalterable truth. Regardless of whether Jews are eating Ashkenazi food or Sephardi food, they can always be counted upon to eat a lot of it. Gentiles drink. Jews eat. It's what we do. This intense relationship between the Jewish palate and stomach is best summed up by a single entry in Claudia Roden's marvellous Book of Jewish Food, which manages to cover both sides of the Jewish culinary coin. It is very short and comes right at the beginning of the recipe for chopped herring. It reads: \"Serves 14.\" \u0095 The Jewish Book Week event Jewish Food - Does it Still Exist? is on Sunday at 10.30am at the Royal National Hotel, Bedford Way, London WC1. Tickets: \u00a35.",

      "body": "<p>When Janet McTeer strides into the lounge of one of London's less fashionable hotels, the resident pianist chooses that moment to strike up \"When You Wish Upon a Star...\" It seems like a particularly fitting way to greet an actress who has, after a 16-year slog working in British theatre and TV, earned this year's surprise Oscar nomination for her Hollywood debut. Her portrayal of a wayward southern belle in Tumbleweeds, a low-budget mother-daughter buddy movie, has enthralled American critics, not least for her honey-drenched Carolina drawl. </p> <p>McTeer, 38, is not remotely starry-eyed about either the nomination or the music. \"That piano is driving me nuts,\" she growls and sinks deeper into her sofa where she begins a series of distracting neck rolls. How did she feel when she heard about her nomination? She screws up her face as if she's just bitten a lemon. \"Disappointed. I felt disappointed and very unsure about my future.\" </p> <p>This is a curious response. Even if she doesn't win, her performance as Mary Jo, the exuberant, emotionally battered mother who drags her 12-year-old daughter across America in search of husband number five will give her a host of opportunities.</p> <p>\"Look,\" she says sternly. \"I did Tumbleweeds for fun. I did it because I loved it and I hardly even got paid. I only earned \u00a33,000 for the whole thing. Now suddenly I'm no longer being treated like an actress. Instead I have become a marketing tool and I feel very uncomfortable with that. There's no space for me to express myself. Every time they take my picture they want to put me in a low-cut dress because I've got big tits. Or else they want me in a ballgown. It really sucks.\" </p> <p>The thought of McTeer in a ballgown is rather comical. At six foot one, with her sharp crop and crisp, no-nonsense diction, she is defiantly ungirly. In the flesh she is far closer to Helen Hewitt, the gritty prison boss she portrayed in The Governor than the flirty leading lady of Tumbleweeds. As an actress, she is compelling because she can bring both childlike vulnerability and brittle sexual power to the same role, as she memorably did as Vita Sackville-West in TV's Portrait of a Marriage, and as a very un-doll-like Nora in A Doll's House. The latter earned her a Tony award during its two-year Broadway run and caught the attention of Gavin O'Connor, first-time director of Tumbleweeds. </p> <p>She says she will attend the Academy Awards out of loyalty to him. \"When I heard about the Oscars, I thought, oh fuck, not that again. I'd just been through it with the Golden Globes. There was a line of press a mile long - two hours later, when I got to my table, everyone had finished dinner so I was starving. But I do realise it's good for the film, so I won't pretend to have flu. I'll go through with it.\" </p> <p>Has she bought a frock? She pulls another grim face. \"Yes, but it's all a nightmare. I did one chat show and that was a disaster. I'm not Jim Carrey. I mean, I can be as funny as the next person on a Friday night with three glasses of wine inside me but I can't do it in front of all those people.\" </p> <p>Actually, she doesn't seem remotely funny to me, but maybe it's just interview nerves. She's more than happy to fulminate about the Hollywood system, but getting her to talk about anything more personal is exhausting. Was she, I ask, the eldest child in her family? She squirms. \"No,\" she almost whispers. What then? \"Youngest.\" Of how many? Long pause. \"Two.\" Brother or sister? \"Sister.\" I try another tack. What experience did she draw on for Mary Jo's generous, nurturing relationship with her daughter. \"Well that just comes from being a nice person.\" It takes a moment to realise she's cracking a joke. </p> <p>To prepare for the role, she went to live in North Carolina at her own expense for two months to understand the world her character had rebelled against. \"Mary Jo had a traditional upbringing where she was expected to be one thing when, in actual fact, she as a person was something else. That's a huge conflict.\" Was it a conflict she had experienced? </p> <p>\"Yes I was slightly outside everything when I was growing up. My mother jokes that I was exchanged at birth. She brought us up to have traditional values. She was absolutely not part of the 60s generation. She might have hummed along to the Beatles but she didn't go out and smoke pot. I remember having huge rows with her and my father about women's position in society even when I was 13.\" </p> <p>McTeer grew up in York, where her father worked for British Rail. She sold coffees at the Theatre Royal and felt an immediate sense of kinship with the actors. At 18, she was accepted by Rada.</p> <p>\"Going to Rada was such a shock, a vast change. I had gone to an all-girls school, lived in a nice little house and then suddenly I'm in the middle of London living in a bedsit next door to the editor of some porn magazine. And I was around boys for the first time, which, frankly, I couldn't handle. I didn't have any brothers and I'd never had any kind of exposure to boys. It came as a horrible shock to find that they were not these glamorous, mysterious creatures but that they had feet of clay.\" Her contemporaries at Rada included Sean Bean and James Wilby, while Kenneth Branagh was a couple of years ahead. </p> <p>Quite how those early experiences impacted on her current relationships is an issue she refuses to be drawn on. She has lived in the same London flat for 15 years and that is all she will say. \"It's ridiculous. Now all people want to know is who I'm sleeping with.\" Did she identify with Mary Jo's need to base her self-esteem on being with a man at all costs? She looks at me incredulously. \"I did not,\" she replies crisply. \"But thanks for asking.\" Then she hoots with laughter. Another little joke. </p> <p>\"It's naive to think there is a woman in the world who isn't brought up to believe that they are waiting for their soulmate. You even see it in Disney. Look at Pocahontas. The girl is always waiting on the river bank for the pretty boy to turn up. But, in real life, there aren't many people who don't want to feel loved, to be in some kind of partnership, whether it's with a man, woman or dog.\" But whether McTeer shares her life with man, woman or dog must on this occasion remain a mystery because she will not elaborate further. </p> <p>Does she feel there's a common link between the characters she plays? \"Yes, I think they are all women waking up to a sense of self or self-esteem, but doing it in very different ways.\" Why is she so drawn to these characters? \"I find it very interesting to look at how some women base their self-esteem on sexual attractiveness and how ultimately they discover that that can be very unfulfilling. </p> <p>\"Of course, everyone is playing that game to a certain extent. I mean there's nothing wrong with wanting to be attractive - I'm wearing lipstick, so are you, but it's a very fine line.\" I smile nervously. What does she mean by that? \"If you cross that line, if you give sexual favours to a man just because he's handsome and buys you champagne, there's a huge price to pay, as Mary Jo discovers.\" </p> <p>Will she move to Hollywood I ask, changing the subject? \"Not in a month of bleeding Sundays. It's not going to happen.\" Too late, she's back venting her spleen against the evils of Hollywood. \"The trouble with Hollywood is that people make assumptions. People assume I want to be famous, they assume I want to do a big studio picture. I don't. I don't want people to recognise me in the street.\" </p> <p>Does she get recognised at the moment? \"No!\" she exclaims indignantly. \"It's been one of the great mysteries of my career. Here I am, six foot one with a striking, strong face and people walk right past me. I mean, how many six foot broads are there for God's sake? Even when I was doing A Doll's House on Broadway, I'd come out and there would be crowds waiting at the stage door. They'd push me aside without realising who I was.\" </p> <p>She has made another independent film, Waking The Dead, directed by Keith Gordon and also co-stars in Christian Levring's Dogme film The King is Alive. \"That was a wonderful experience.\" Next she intends to stay at home and write a screenplay following an abortive attempt to work on a script for A Doll's House. \"I had my first run in with American money and it had to be abandoned. Now I want to write something of my own.\" </p> <p>Although she says she's really \"a theatre person\", she adds: \"I'd like to work with Pedro Almodovar. He was at the Golden Globes and he looked miserable,\" she says gleefully. \"So did Sam [Mendes], so it's not just me.\" She gets up to depart and suddenly looks at me in panic. \"You won't make me out to sound like a complete bitch, will you?\" She's learning.</p>",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>In 1988 husband-and-wife writing team John Gregory Dunne and Joan Didion were hired to script an adaptation of Golden Girl, Alanna Nash's biography of US broadcaster Jessica Savitch. Six years later a finished movie eventually emerged - the Robert Redford-Michelle Pfeiffer vehicle Up Close and Personal. Dunne chronicled the whole nightmarish process...</p> <p><strong>A Buyer's Market</strong></p> <p> It was a buyer's market. Once profligate in developing scripts, only a fraction of which ever went into production, the studios, having humbled the writers in the strike and thinned their inventory of expensive development projects, were in a feisty, fee-cutting mood. Speculative scripts, on the other hand, many of them written during the strike (the only kind of screen work WGA [Writers Guild of America] members could do, since it was without recompense), were the rage.</p> <p>The beauty of a spec script was that it was finished, could be read and discarded at a sitting if found wanting, and put into production quickly if desirable. The bidding wars on the hotter spec scripts, mainly action thrillers like The Last Boy Scout, Radio Flyer, and Ultimatum, sent prices through the roof; a million dollars became the floor bid when an auction was held. </p> <p>Toward the development project, however - the project adapted from a book or a play or a magazine article and then nurtured into a screenplay - the studios in this post-strike era brought an accountant's green eyeshade. WGA rules mandate that writers receive a significant portion of their fee upon signing - in other words, before a word is written - and the balance of their first-draft payment upon delivery to the studio.</p> <p>The inexorability of these payments is what makes studios sullen, and they try to control the script in endless meetings, often with as many as a dozen people present, all of them offering their ideas about what the script should be. To attend one of these meetings is to understand the cold truth of the saying that a camel is a horse made by a committee. </p> <p>Neither John Foreman [the producer who hired Dunne and Didion] nor we were under any illusions that Golden Girl would be an easy sell. There had been a time in the late 60s and early 70s, the period of Darling and Easy Rider and Midnight Cowboy, when the life of Jessica Savitch would have been an eminently feasible subject for a film, with the possibility of a considerable profit if the budget was strictly managed.</p> <p>Her story was a perfect cautionary gloss on the perils of the counterculture - a small-town girl with more ambition than brains, an overactive libido, a sexual ambivalence, a tenuous hold on the truth, a taste for controlled substances, a longtime abusive Svengali relationship, a certain mental instability, a glamour job, and then in 1983 a final reckoning, at age 35, that seemed ordained by the Fates - death by drowning with her last lover in three feet of Delaware Canal mud after a freak automobile accident.</p> <p>This was not a tale, however cautionary, much valued in the climate of the late 80s, when high concept - a picture that could be described in a single line, such as Flashdance (blue-collar woman steelworker in the Rust Belt becomes a ballerina) or Top Gun (cowboy Navy jet jockeys train and love at Mach 2), pushed along by a hit-music track - was in vogue. Studio after studio passed on Golden Girl. Then, shortly after Thanksgiving 1988, John called from Los Angeles to say that he had received a nibble from an unlikely source - the Walt Disney Company. </p> <p><strong>The Monster</strong></p> <p>Once known mainly for its animated features and the cartoon shorts of Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck, WDPc (as Walt Disney Pictures is referred to in its contracts), with Michael Eisner as its CEO and Jeffrey Katzenberg its head of motion-picture production, had become a Hollywood powerhouse.</p> <p>After a string of tightly budgeted commercial hits, Disney was on a roll, and believed it had found a formula, sure-fire as long as that formula - family entertainment that did not too rigorously tax the imagination - was controlled by its own executives. The bottom line was king and the audience that mattered was the company's stakeholders, with whom Disney enjoyed an extraordinarily profitable fiduciary rapport. To the studio's studied indifference, the brand-name actors and film-makers used to getting top dollar and their own way tended to bring their wares elsewhere. </p> <p>Toward those members of the creative community not coveted by other studios, Disney's attitude was to take no prisoners. Late one evening, at a back table in Le Dome, a Sunset Strip restaurant much favoured by the industry, a producer and a writer we knew were arguing vigorously against the changes the studio was demanding in a picture already in production. The president of the Disney division overseeing the picture suddenly demanded silence. He was, he said, forced by the writer's intransigence to take the monster out of its cage. </p> <p>In the silence that ensued, the division president reached under the table, pretended to grab a small predatory animal from its lair, and then, as if clutching the creature by the neck first, exhibited his empty, clawlike hand to the people around the table. He asked the screenwriter if he saw the monster, and the writer, not knowing what else to do, nodded yes. </p> <p>I'm going to put it back in its cage now, the executive said, drawing each word out, and I never want you to force me to bring it out again. Then he mimed putting the monster back into its cage under the table. When he was done, the executive asked the writer, \"Do you know what the monster is?\" </p> <p>The writer shook his head. </p> <p>The executive said: \"It's our money.\" </p> <p>In time, after a run of box-office failures, the executive himself met the monster, and was fired the way studio presidents are fired: he was allowed to work out his contract as a Disney independent producer. </p> <p><strong>Meet &amp; Greet</strong></p> <p>The reputation for being difficult to deal with was something Disney actively encouraged at that time. With [Disney studio head Jeffrey] Katzenberg its point man, the studio had taken a consistently hard line during the strike, and there was little collegial spirit among the people who worked there, some of whom referred to Disney as Mouschwitz or Duckau, after its two most famous cartoon characters. </p> <p>Though we had been adamant about not attending pitch meetings, John Foreman called to ask if, since Katzenberg was going to be in New York on December 9, we would agree just this once to meet with him. I was reluctant. I did not think Golden Girl the sort of picture Disney would ever make, and a meeting with Katzenberg sounded like a waste of time.</p> <p>Joan was practical: she said my cardiac distress, however optimistic the prognosis, was still an unknown factor that might kick in at any moment; we needed the health insurance, and this was the only card on the table. Together we prepared Golden Girl down to a one-sentence pitch: the story of an ugly duckling with nothing much going for her who reinvents herself at great effort and greater cost into a golden girl. </p> <p>On the appointed day, Joan went to see Katzenberg by herself. It is well to remember that Hollywood is largely a boys' club. The presence of a woman at a studio meeting tends to make male executives uneasy. Whenever Joan and I are at a script conference, the questions are invariably directed at me; for years Joan was tolerated only as an \"honorary guy\", or perhaps an \"associate guy\", whose primary function was to take notes.</p> <p>This mind-set is prevalent even to this day. \"Is John there?\" an executive's assistant will say over the telephone when calling for his master. \"This is Joan.\" \"Tell John to call when he gets home.\"</p> <p>We have always maintained contractually that as screenwriters (our only professional collaboration), one of us equals both, and her going solo to meet Katzenberg would establish that premise with Disney. There was also the thought that my continued lack of enthusiasm for the meeting might prove contagious. Hobbled by a household accident that had taken most of the skin off her right shin from knee to ankle (a heavy tabletop had fallen on her leg while she was checking a storage closet), and unable to get a cab, Joan walked 14 blocks through the snow to Disney's Park Avenue offices. </p> <p>The purpose of such a meet-and-greet is to allow the executive to size up the supplicant. Katzenberg had not read Golden Girl, but he was aware of the less savoury details of Jessica Savitch's life. He liked the ugly-duckling idea; it was the kind of narrative he wanted, and he was also responsive to the television background against which it would be played.</p> <p>He did have reservations, and here I quote Joan's notes of that first meeting: \"Wants to know what is going to happen in this picture that will make the audience walk out feeling uplifted, good about something and good about themselves.\" With subjunctives and qualifiers in place, Katzenberg indicated that Disney could make an offer if somewhere in Savitch's messy life we could find an angle that would fit within the studio's story parameters. With this as our Christmas holiday project, it was agreed that we would meet again in Los Angeles after the New Year with the full Disney creative team. </p> <p><strong>The Suits</strong></p> <p>To see what kind of deal Disney might be contemplating, we called our agents at ICM, Jeffrey Berg and Patty Detroit. Berg and Detroit spelled out the new realities: our first-draft fee would be nearly 60 percent less than it had been before the strike, and we would have to write more drafts to get a smaller total fee, the biggest chunk of which would be loaded on to the back end, payable only if, after shooting ended, it was adjudicated that we were due either a solo or shared credit.</p> <p>\"Net points\" (or a share of net profits), would be negligible. With a ceiling on the amount we could even hypothetically receive, the pay-off on net points has become such a rarity, as a result of the industry's elastic accounting practices, that they are dismissed as \"brownie points\". The offer was take it or leave it. We took, and signed a deal that also called for a producers' development fee - what is called \"walking around money\" - for John Foreman and [Foreman's producing partner] Ed Hookstratten. </p> <p>Late in January 1989, Foreman, Hookstratten, Joan and I went to Disney's Burbank offices to meet with Katzenberg, David Hoberman (the president of Touchstone Pictures, the division to which the project was assigned), and a full studio support team of vice-presidents and creative executives - the \"suits\".</p> <p>In the seven weeks since Joan's New York meeting with Katzenberg, she and I had expanded on the idea of Savitch as an ugly duckling turned golden girl. In the notes we prepared for the Burbank meeting, we wrote that Savitch was moving in the very fast, very big-time, very demanding, very seductive world of network news... which she fails to understand is a men's club, in which, when she gets close to achieving her goal, she is closed out. </p> <p>She is closed out in the traditional way: it is said that she is unstable, that she sleeps around, that she uses drugs, drink, sex, whatever, in her \"relentless\" drive to succeed; that she is, in short, \"too ambitious\". The double bind. It was the most positive spin we could put on the life of a newscaster whom David Brinkley had once publicly labelled \"the dumbest woman I ever met\". </p> <p>The subordinate suits waited for Katzenberg to open questioning. Did she have to die in the end?, he wanted to know. It was a question we had anticipated. If the character was not called Jessica Savitch, we answered carefully, then it was not necessary that she die. Disney, with its family reputation, was also uncomfortable with Savitch's addiction to cocaine. The transformation had begun, and the caveats to add up, if only inferentially. Savitch had once had an affair with CBS newscaster Ed Bradley, and we surmised that the interracial nature of that relationship might be another source of discomfort for Disney's core audience. </p> <p>Her abortions could also pose a problem, as could her two marriages, especially the second to a gay gynaecologist, who, less than a year after they married, hanged himself in the basement of her Philadelphia home. And it was clear that an uplifting story that would make an audience feel good about itself was not going to encompass any allusion either to Savitch's suicide attempts or to the lesbian episodes in her life. </p> <p>Then there was Ron Kershaw, the antisocial, alcoholic news director who was her lover, mentor, and tormentor through most of Savitch's professional career (and through both of her marriages). Something of a genius broadcast gypsy, Kershaw skipped from city to city and channel to channel successfully reconfiguring news departments, and finding new Galatea reporters and anchors on whom he could work his magic.</p> <p>\"She only existed electronically,\" Kershaw told Alanna Nash about Savitch, and it was he, according to Golden Girl, who taught her the smile that became her on-the-air trademark. \"You've got to show teeth,\" he told Savitch. \"Teeth is vulnerability in primates, whether you're a chimp or Dan Rather.\" Kershaw was also an aggressor, who, when he was not feeding Savitch cocaine, regularly beat her black and blue. </p> <p>If Savitch was not Disney's ideal heroine, Kershaw (who has since died of cancer) left something to be desired as a romantic hero. Still, Disney was willing to go to a first draft before offering any specific suggestions, which would then, of course, have the force of law. When we left Burbank that day, this is what we knew: that as long as WDPc was footing the bills, Jessica Savitch would cease to be a factor in the Jessica Savitch screenplay. To persist in writing her story under Disney's rules would be like writing a biography of Charles Lindbergh without mentioning the kidnapping and murder of his son, the trial and execution of Bruno Hauptmann for those crimes, and Lindbergh's flirtation with fascism and America First. </p> <p>What we did not know was that it would take six more years, four more contracts, two other writers, and 27 drafts of our own before the picture that resulted from this meeting reached its first day of principal photography.</p> <p>\u0095 Monster: Living Off the Big Screen (Pan) by John Gregory Dunne is published on March 10.

If Savitch was not Disney's ideal heroine, Kershaw (who has since died of cancer) left something to be desired as a romantic hero. Still, Disney was willing to go to a first draft before offering any specific suggestions, which would then, of course, have the force of law. When we left Burbank that day, this is what we knew: that as long as WDPc was footing the bills, Jessica Savitch would cease to be a factor in the Jessica Savitch screenplay. To persist in writing her story under Disney's rules would be like writing a biography of Charles Lindbergh without mentioning the kidnapping and murder of his son, the trial and execution of Bruno Hauptmann for those crimes, and Lindbergh's flirtation with fascism and America First. What we did not know was that it would take six more years, four more contracts, two other writers, and 27 drafts of our own before the picture that resulted from this meeting reached its first day of principal photography. \u0095 Monster: Living Off the Big Screen (Pan) by John Gregory Dunne is published on March 10.

      "body": "<p>Ten years ago, I made a series of films with the Nuba people of Sudan. I promised to return to show them there but the escalation of the civil war and the refusal of an entry visa made it impossible for me to return until last year. </p> <p>I first lived in the Sudan in 1980, when I left a teaching post in a dysfunctional south London school to become an English teacher in Kadugli in the Nuba mountains, which occupy an area roughly the size of Scotland. They are a lush, fertile oasis in central Sudan. </p> <p>The inaccessibility of the mountains had kept the Nuba people isolated and protected from the rest of the country. Until the 19th century, the mountains had defended the Nuba from the slave raiders of the north and during the 17-year civil war, between the north and the south after independence from Britain in 1955, the Nuba mountains remained uninvolved and unscathed. </p> <p>Nuba society was co-operative and egalitarian. Every single person I knew in the mountains could play a musical instrument. The rainfall there is plentiful and the good soil ensures sufficient food throughout the year. </p> <p>After living for two years in the Sudan, I left to study film at the National Film and Television school. Six years later, I returned to work as a camera operator for a Sudanese film director, who has to remain anonymous. His film aimed to highlight the abuse of Islamic laws that had been implemented in 1983 by the now-deposed president Gaafar al-Nimeiry. </p> <p>The director hoped working with a foreign crew would help if filming got rough. The political situation had changed drastically in Sudan: after 10 years of peace, there was war in the south again. The Sudanese People's Liberation Army (SPLA) were fighting against the policies of Arabisation and the implementation of Islamic laws, which included stoning to death for adultery, amputations for theft and death for apostasy - the crime of renouncing Islam. This was causing massive unrest in a country with over 300 ethnic groups and a 40% non-Muslim population. </p> <p>In December 1983, 3,000 people in Khartoum witnessed a public amputation: two soldiers dressed in surgical theatre aprons chopped off the hands of two young men with sterilised knives. The chopped hands were raised for a cheering public to see. </p> <p>Two years later on January 17, 1985 in Kober prison, there was a public hanging, of a popular, charismatic 76-year-old Islamic philosopher and teacher Mahmoud Mohamed Taha. This execution was an pivotal moment in Sudanese history. The country would never be the same again. </p> <p>Taha's \"crime\" was his unwillingness to repent publicly for issuing a pamphlet arguing against the religious establishment and the misuse and appropriation of Islamic laws. He argued for a progressive Islam, acknowledging the emancipation of women. </p> <p>What happened to his body after the execution, nobody knows. But all versions agree that his body was never granted a correct Islamic funeral; the corpse was denied and taken by helicopter, possibly cut into pieces and scattered over the Red Sea or that the body was flown over the desert north of Omdurman and dropped from a great height - ultimately denying him a grave and eradicating a possible place of pilgrimage or shrine for a martyr. </p> <p>The execution was presided over personally by Dr Hassan Turabi, who was then both minister of justice and head of the Muslim Brothers - later to be known as the National Islamic Front (NIF). The execution provided Turabi with political ascendancy. It was the beginning of a roller-coaster of violence and oppression and the end of hope for a democratic secular society in the Sudan. </p> <p>Our filming in Khartoum had to stop. The director had become ill with anxiety and hepatitis and our guide, John Luke, a Catholic southerner from the Dinka tribe, had been wrongfully accused and amputated for stealing a piece of balsa wood from the university of Khartoum, and was now facing death threats. </p> <p>The exposed film was left in a fridge in Khartoum and, with a group of Nuba friends, we fled the insecurities and politics of Khartoum and travelled south to the benevolence and sanity of the Nuba mountains. The amputations and execution of philosophers and intellectuals in Khartoum did not seem to be affecting our friends in the mountains, still peripheral to the main currents of Sudanese politics. </p> <p>During this time, we made a film called Kafi's Story. The account of a young man from Torogi in the Nuba mountains who travels to Khartoum to earn money to buy a wedding dress for his second wife. Kafi took the cassette recorder and talked and talked. This intimate monologue narrates the film. His concerns were for his domestic arrangements; the infidelity of his first wife and his marriage to a second. One morning, we witnessed the arrival of the army garrison. The next day we heard that the mountains were being referred to as War Zone 2. The SPLA was advancing. The mountains became vulnerable, no longer strong enough to resist the disruption. On many nights, we could hear the gunfire in the distance between the army and the SPLA. </p> <p>With the beginning of the rainy season and the end of filming, we left. I promised to return within two years with a projector and generator to give the films their first screening in the mountains. </p> <p>Within weeks of our departure, I heard that Kafi's village (Torogi) had been the battleground between the SPLA and the government forces. According to SPLA radio, the Nuba population had been used as shields for the army. I applied to the Sudanese embassy in London for a visa but I was refused. The situation in the Nuba mountains deteriorated and the civil war in Sudan intensified. I re-applied for a visa but was refused again. Despite a government information blackout, fragments of news occasionally leaked out. Within a year, 60,000 Nuba people had been driven away from their homes. By 1993, after repeated raids and destruction of villages, the Nuba mountains were suffering the most severe man-made famine in the Sudan. No food relief was being allowed in. </p> <p>Two years ago, with a new passport, I obtained the visa and a press pass that allowed me to photograph the celebrations in honour of the NIF that were to be held in the capital, Khartoum. I had no permission to visit the Nuba, but I knew that in the endless peripheries, in the shanty-towns of Khartoum, I would find my Nuba friends. </p> <p>No fighting had ever occurred in Khartoum. The civil war had been restricted to the Nuba mountains, to southern Sudan and to the east and west of the country. With the exception of a new airport, brightly painted minarets attached to new mosques and some ostentatious palatial homes for the very rich - with satellite dishes and high walls - Khartoum seemed derelict. What I had once known as a cosmopolitan city now looked empty and silent. Everything was broken. </p> <p>I filmed the military parade. Above us on a podium were the architects of the regime, Dr Turabi, the ideological backbone, and his head of state General Basheer. They were surrounded by heavy security while a crackling amplified voice with feedback repeated relentlessly \"Allah Akbar, Allah Akbar\" (God is great, God is great). </p> <p>First came the horses, followed by soldiers, tanks, bicycles, more soldiers, camels, flags, military bands and in the middle of this parade were the children. A group of at least 100 Nuba kids, dressed identically with Sudanese flags pinned to their breasts, were from the peace camps. It is estimated that over 15,000 Nuba children have been forcibly taken away from their parents and taken to peace camps in a government programme for forcible religious conversion, and a pernicious tool for dismembering Nuba society and identity - the children undergo military training and eventually become accomplices in the destruction of their own communities. </p> <p>Throughout the following year, my search for old friends took me to the squatter settlements in the outskirts of the northern cities, to the mountains where the Nuba resistance holds out and to the refugee camps on the Sudan/ Kenyan border. </p> <p>In all three locations, I found old friends I knew from the days of Kafi's Story. In all three locations, I screened the films for the very first time to Nuba audiences, and in all three locations, I witnessed and heard of the genocidal war - the limbs that had been cut from the innocent, the scars of crucifixions, the burns on bodies of children, the pain of mothers and the aloneness of the Nuba. Nuba Conversations is an account of this journey and a testament to their courage, dignity and strength, and to the suffering they continue to endure. </p> <p>They have been ignored by the world. They are a people of grace and goodness but of no monetary interest to the west. It is now more than 10 years since the government offensive against the Nuba population began, but only in June 1999 did the first UN assessment mission take place in the Nuba mountains. Despite their two short visits, no UN aid nor UN human rights monitoring has ever occurred there. </p> <p>On a daily basis, the Nubas continue to be punished by the NIF regime with impunity. Why? Because they do not conform to the ideal version of Turabi's world. Because the vibrancy of Nuba culture defies the narrow cultural norms of a homogenised Arab-Islamic Sudan. Because the Nubas are black and the Arab mask does not fit. </p> <p>After every horror of the 20th century we promise ourselves never to allow this to happen again. Now is the time to act. What can we do?</p> <p>\u0095 Nuba Conversations and Kafi's Story are showing as part of The Human Rights Watch international film festival at the Ritzy cinema, Brixton, London SW2 at 12.30pm tomorrow.

Me, I'm just waiting for the clocks to go forward; but, like everything else, it won't be happening in February.</p> <p> You'd think you could count on the movies as a source of distraction, a means of fast-forwarding through the boredom two hours at a time, $7.50 a shot. Well, you can't. It's still going to be February when you come out - and it's more than likely that you just saw a shitty movie.</p> <p> And probably the same shitty movies as last week, since the box office chart remains largely unchanged. The Whole Nine Yards still squats on top of the pile, while the Ephron sisters' Hanging Up dropped from number two to four thanks to bad word-of-mouth (and bulging barf-bags too, I'll wager).</p> <p>Elsewhere, there are those movies still clinging on from last week: The Tigger Movie (I've already got my tie-in Tigger slipper-shoes and I'll fight the man who mocks them) at number six and Scream 3 at eight.</p> <p>Then there are The Cider House Rules and American Beauty, Oscar contenders rolled out to graze some last-minute cash. And at five is the sub-Alien sci-fi thriller Pitch Black, which appeals to those members of the teenage male audience who believe their dates will give it up a lot quicker if they're scared half to death.</p> <p> Bad plan, fellers, because Pitch Black isn't frightening. Better get 'em drunk instead.</p> <p> Which leaves us with the only two new releases: John Frankenheimer's Reindeer Games and Curtis Hanson's first movie since LA Confidential, Wonder Boys, with Michael Douglas.</p> <p> For me, the best line of dialogue from the entire 1990s came from a Frankenheimer film (I know - I'm as surprised as you are), last year's slick Euro-thriller Ronin. After multiple betrayals, double-crosses and murders, a perfidious Russian techie-spook named Gregor (the magnificently reptilian Stellan Skarsgard) laments the way things have turned out, a state of affairs for which he himself is largely responsible: \"Look at us all. What could have been conducted in polite, collegial fashion is now fucked into cocked hat.\"</p> <p>Actually, Skarsgard says \"farked into cocked het\", but no matter. The point is that Frankenheimer, who hasn't made many great movies, can usually be relied on to produce one or two golden moments like that in most of his movies.</p> <p> Frankenheimer's curse has been that all his best work came in the first few years of his career, before the 60s were two-thirds over. And it didn't help that the first to go over big was also, unarguably, the only masterpiece he's ever made: The Manchurian Candidate.</p> <p>It was a film so attuned to the pathologies of its time - the emerging saturation-media landscape, the rise of a fanatically anti-communist, John Birch-like right, and the twin spectres of coup d'etat and political assassination - that one's surprised to find it as fresh and sharp now as it was then. George Axelrod extracted from Richard Condon's bestseller a degree of political savvy largely absent from more po-faced political thrillers of the time such as Fail-Safe.</p> <p>Along with Gore Vidal's The Best Man (directed by Franklin Schaffner in 1964), it's one of the few movies about politics that audiences have grown into, rather than out of. Each film had to wait 20 years until we had become as cynical and jaded about politics as they already were.</p> <p> Frankenheimer never bettered it, but Seven Days in May and Birdman of Alcatraz were intelligent and gripping, quintessential, issues-based liberal films of the 60s. And in 1966 he came close, with the nightmarish Seconds, in which John Farrow (then just off the blacklist) submits to a rejuvenation programme and emerges in his new life as disturbed swinging bachelor Rock Hudson. It's one of the neglected classics of its era, prefiguring the paranoia and anxiety of the Watergate era.</p> <p> Sadly, for every The Gypsy Moths (which had Deborah Kerr topless at 50) there's a Dead Bang or a Black Sunday, and for every The Fixer, there's a Fourth War or a 99 and 40/100 Percent Dead. And Frankenheimer's career went off the rails in the 1970s, when, by his own confession, he was half-drunk half the time and all drunk the rest. I know he was pissed up when he approved that last title.</p> <p> Ronin wasn't deep or even very brainy, but it was good, solid Frankenheimer. Reindeer Games lingers in a similar heist-and-betrayal milieu, but it isn't good anything. Frankenheimer is directing a script by Ehren Kruger, who wrote Scream 3 and deserves to be nicknamed Mister Twist for the contortions he puts his characters and audiences through.</p> <p> There's something deeply undignified about a man pushing 70 associating himself with jejune material like this, a violent robbery comedy that might as well be called Scream 4: Casino Heist.</p> <p> Frankenheimer is also stuck with the largely charisma-free Ben Affleck, whose ascent to stardom continues to mystify me. There seems to be a fat man inside him straining to get out - and anyone who remembers his rotund bully from Dazed &amp; Confused will know that he's since shed about 50lb - which works out to about a crate of Fight Club soap. I'm praying he piles the weight back on and disappears from the screen into podgy obscurity.</p> <p> As for Wonder Boys, it only rose to number seven, despite good reviews. I wasn't rabid for LA Confidential (I'm a Chinatown guy right down the line) and I hated The River Wild, so I haven't raced to see it yet.</p> <p>I did once meet director Curtis Hanson at a big Hollywood party and he was every inch the perfect gentleman, despite the fact I spent our entire conversation labouring under the misapprehension that he was LA underground filmmaker Curtis Harrington. Oh, I wince to recall it...</p>",

Elsewhere, there are those movies still clinging on from last week: The Tigger Movie (I've already got my tie-in Tigger slipper-shoes and I'll fight the man who mocks them) at number six and Scream 3 at eight. Then there are The Cider House Rules and American Beauty, Oscar contenders rolled out to graze some last-minute cash. And at five is the sub-Alien sci-fi thriller Pitch Black, which appeals to those members of the teenage male audience who believe their dates will give it up a lot quicker if they're scared half to death. Bad plan, fellers, because Pitch Black isn't frightening. Better get 'em drunk instead. Which leaves us with the only two new releases: John Frankenheimer's Reindeer Games and Curtis Hanson's first movie since LA Confidential, Wonder Boys, with Michael Douglas. For me, the best line of dialogue from the entire 1990s came from a Frankenheimer film (I know - I'm as surprised as you are), last year's slick Euro-thriller Ronin. After multiple betrayals, double-crosses and murders, a perfidious Russian techie-spook named Gregor (the magnificently reptilian Stellan Skarsgard) laments the way things have turned out, a state of affairs for which he himself is largely responsible: \"Look at us all. What could have been conducted in polite, collegial fashion is now fucked into cocked hat.\" Actually, Skarsgard says \"farked into cocked het\", but no matter. The point is that Frankenheimer, who hasn't made many great movies, can usually be relied on to produce one or two golden moments like that in most of his movies. Frankenheimer's curse has been that all his best work came in the first few years of his career, before the 60s were two-thirds over. And it didn't help that the first to go over big was also, unarguably, the only masterpiece he's ever made: The Manchurian Candidate. It was a film so attuned to the pathologies of its time - the emerging saturation-media landscape, the rise of a fanatically anti-communist, John Birch-like right, and the twin spectres of coup d'etat and political assassination - that one's surprised to find it as fresh and sharp now as it was then. George Axelrod extracted from Richard Condon's bestseller a degree of political savvy largely absent from more po-faced political thrillers of the time such as Fail-Safe. Along with Gore Vidal's The Best Man (directed by Franklin Schaffner in 1964), it's one of the few movies about politics that audiences have grown into, rather than out of. Each film had to wait 20 years until we had become as cynical and jaded about politics as they already were. Frankenheimer never bettered it, but Seven Days in May and Birdman of Alcatraz were intelligent and gripping, quintessential, issues-based liberal films of the 60s. And in 1966 he came close, with the nightmarish Seconds, in which John Farrow (then just off the blacklist) submits to a rejuvenation programme and emerges in his new life as disturbed swinging bachelor Rock Hudson. It's one of the neglected classics of its era, prefiguring the paranoia and anxiety of the Watergate era. Sadly, for every The Gypsy Moths (which had Deborah Kerr topless at 50) there's a Dead Bang or a Black Sunday, and for every The Fixer, there's a Fourth War or a 99 and 40/100 Percent Dead. And Frankenheimer's career went off the rails in the 1970s, when, by his own confession, he was half-drunk half the time and all drunk the rest. I know he was pissed up when he approved that last title. Ronin wasn't deep or even very brainy, but it was good, solid Frankenheimer. Reindeer Games lingers in a similar heist-and-betrayal milieu, but it isn't good anything. Frankenheimer is directing a script by Ehren Kruger, who wrote Scream 3 and deserves to be nicknamed Mister Twist for the contortions he puts his characters and audiences through. There's something deeply undignified about a man pushing 70 associating himself with jejune material like this, a violent robbery comedy that might as well be called Scream 4: Casino Heist. Frankenheimer is also stuck with the largely charisma-free Ben Affleck, whose ascent to stardom continues to mystify me. There seems to be a fat man inside him straining to get out - and anyone who remembers his rotund bully from Dazed &amp; Confused will know that he's since shed about 50lb - which works out to about a crate of Fight Club soap. I'm praying he piles the weight back on and disappears from the screen into podgy obscurity. As for Wonder Boys, it only rose to number seven, despite good reviews. I wasn't rabid for LA Confidential (I'm a Chinatown guy right down the line) and I hated The River Wild, so I haven't raced to see it yet. I did once meet director Curtis Hanson at a big Hollywood party and he was every inch the perfect gentleman, despite the fact I spent our entire conversation labouring under the misapprehension that he was LA underground filmmaker Curtis Harrington. Oh, I wince to recall it...",

This was a military adventure that is popularly conceived to be a virtual-reality, postwar war - although, unlike the recent Nato action against Serbia, it did involve a quaint ground-troop invasion, and Three Kings finds itself in this more old-fashioned military context. </p> <p>The film conflates a number of generic approaches. It sometimes has the acid-trippy, alienated feel of an Apocalypse Now or a Platoon; it sometimes affects the grandstanding, busily appalled humour of M*A*S*H; occasionally it strives for the grandeur associated with the theatre of 1939-45: there is a scene in which a tank mightily turns its barrel on a troublesome sniper that is lifted straight out of Saving Private Ryan. </p> <p>Three Kings is set at the moment of victory itself: Saddam has surrendered. American servicemen, their sword of valour never, as it were, tempered in the fire of real combat, are in a strange, volatile mood: relieved, euphorically triumphant, oddly frustrated. It is their uneasy task now to enforce a pax americana, which involves accepting the abject surrender of thousands of Iraqis while encouraging a putative rebel faction to rise up against the Ba'athist regime. All of this, while drifting aimlessly about in the desert landscape fringed with burning wells, and trying to think of ways of keeping the media encampment happy. </p> <p>In the midst of all this grisly modernity, what do two soldiers, Sergeant Troy Barlow (Mark Wahlberg) and Staff Sergeant Chief Elgin (Ice Cube) discover, but an old-fashioned treasure map! Tonnes of hidden Kuwaiti gold bullion liberated by the Iraqis and now begging to be taken by some enterprising Americans. Their map is commandeered by Major Archie Gates (George Clooney) and they set off behind enemy lines to swipe the gleaming yellow bars. </p> <p>Exactly how the hell they expect to convert them into exchangeable currency for use back home is not a question that weighs heavily on us. Instead, we enjoy the stylish cinematography of Newton Thomas Sigel, and Russell's very adroit management of both the military set-pieces and the internal tensions of the hero group, which actually includes another renegade American soldier (like The Three Musketeers, there are really four of them) - this is Conrad Vig, a leering good-ol'-boy played by Spike Jonze. </p> <p>All around them, in every direction, the level sands stretch vastly away, and this gives everything a weird and faintly surreal air. Russell's screenplay has a lot of snap. At one stage, Chief Elgin bitterly objects, as an African-American, to other ranks' use of the phrase \"sand-coon\" to describe the enemy: \" 'Towel-head' and 'sand-jockey' are perfectly good substitutes!\" Such fastidiousness is a little strange for the former gangsta rapper Ice Cube, but he himself is really quite impressive in this role, and, catching up with Wahlberg, has graduated convincingly to the screen from the world of music. </p> <p>They give appreciably happier performances than Clooney, who appears to have arrived having, in Woody Allen's time-honoured phrase, just taken his handsome lesson. This film would appear to require George to act up a Desert Storm: he has to be a plausibly embittered, cynical soldier prepared to risk his pension for this crazy, greedy scheme. But, secondly, he must have a streak of pure gold bullion in his heart, and be ready to risk the prize to help his new buddies and, indeed, the Iraqi civilians, while maintaining a manly emotional reticence about just what a fantastic guy he's being. Needless to say, it's this second aspect that George is keenest on. And it is clearly a bit of a wrench not to be able to get his stethoscope out at any time. </p> <p>Irony and historical perspective are provided when it sinks into the minds of our heroes that America is, in a sense, the author of this chaos. America had armed and trained Saddam in the days when it took Iraq's side against Iran; and now it was casually encouraging anti-Saddam rebels to risk everything in an uprising. But the film does not touch on the actual bombing of Baghdad and its cowering civilians - a manoeuvre intended to create these revolutionary conditions - and Three Kings is always careful to indict the political rather than the military establishment. (There are no walk-on roles for blithering British officers, incidentally - though I would have liked to have seen a representation of John Major in the desert wearing his woolly jumper.) </p> <p>Three Kings has the lineaments of a wised-up anti-war film, but with an undercurrent of warmly lenient, sentimental admiration for the American fighting man: it makes for a strange flavour, but this is an enjoyable and intelligent action film.</p>",

Irony and historical perspective are provided when it sinks into the minds of our heroes that America is, in a sense, the author of this chaos. America had armed and trained Saddam in the days when it took Iraq's side against Iran; and now it was casually encouraging anti-Saddam rebels to risk everything in an uprising. But the film does not touch on the actual bombing of Baghdad and its cowering civilians - a manoeuvre intended to create these revolutionary conditions - and Three Kings is always careful to indict the political rather than the military establishment. (There are no walk-on roles for blithering British officers, incidentally - though I would have liked to have seen a representation of John Major in the desert wearing his woolly jumper.) Three Kings has the lineaments of a wised-up anti-war film, but with an undercurrent of warmly lenient, sentimental admiration for the American fighting man: it makes for a strange flavour, but this is an enjoyable and intelligent action film.",

One such is John Howe, who recently stood trial at Luton Crown Court for robbing a railway signal box at Aspley Guise in Bedfordshire. Mr Howe, 45, of no fixed abode, had raided the box with friend Paul Paget, threatening signalman William Freitag with an iron bar before forcing him to lie face down on the floor and tying him up. As they set about loading Mr Freitag's car with stolen goods, however, the terrified signalman pointed out that the 6.02 London Express was due to pass at any minute, and that the level crossing barriers were still closed. Lesser criminals might have ignored his warnings, concentrating instead on simply getting away with their loot. Not so Mr Howe. Donning his victim's official railway hat and jacket he went outside, flagged traffic to a halt, pulled open the barriers, and then stood blowing his whistle and waving as the train flew past. Once it was safely through he closed the barriers again, returned to the signal box, filled in Mr Freitag's log book and then finally made his escape.

Before the election, Labour promised it would use the internationally approved measure of joblessness, based on the quarterly door-to-door survey of 160,000 households which asks people if they are looking for work. </p> <p>The TUC said its measure of the \"hidden jobless\", which counts not only those who say they are actively looking for work but also those who say they want a job, was a more accurate measure of unemployment. \"No one much trusted the claimant count unemployment figures under the last government. It would be a mistake to start believing them now,\" said Mr Monks. </p> <p>The report warns that there are still sharp differences between prosperous regions such as the south-east and more depressed regions such as the north-east. </p> <p>\"This report will provide uncomfortable reading for almost everyone involved in the economic policy debate,\" said Mr Monks. \"While prosperous regions have their depressed areas, and there are affluent suburbs in every region, there are clear differences between Britain's regions.\"</p>",

Mr Monks said there was no room for complacency about unemployment, even though the claimant count has fallen by nearly 300,000 since Labour came to power. On Tuesday, the treasury used the claimant count figures to show that the number of vacancies in the economy is almost equal to the number of unemployed people. In an echo of Norman Tebbit's famous call to the jobless to get on their bikes and find a job, Mr Brown said: \"I say to the unemployed who can work - you must now meet your responsibility to earn a wage.\" The chancellor came under immediate attack from the Tories, who accused him of using figures that Labour denounced when it was in opposition as \"fiddled\". Before the election, Labour promised it would use the internationally approved measure of joblessness, based on the quarterly door-to-door survey of 160,000 households which asks people if they are looking for work. The TUC said its measure of the \"hidden jobless\", which counts not only those who say they are actively looking for work but also those who say they want a job, was a more accurate measure of unemployment. \"No one much trusted the claimant count unemployment figures under the last government. It would be a mistake to start believing them now,\" said Mr Monks. The report warns that there are still sharp differences between prosperous regions such as the south-east and more depressed regions such as the north-east. \"This report will provide uncomfortable reading for almost everyone involved in the economic policy debate,\" said Mr Monks. \"While prosperous regions have their depressed areas, and there are affluent suburbs in every region, there are clear differences between Britain's regions.\"",
