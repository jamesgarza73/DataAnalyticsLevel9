      "bodyText": "A fundamental overhaul of the funding practices of the main bodies funding academic research projects as well as employment policies in universities is needed to improve the career prospects for women academics, a report concludes today. The long awaited conclusions of a survey of grant applications among male and female researchers by the Wellcome Trust and research councils concludes that there is no evidence of direct gender discrimination in the allocation of research funding. However, the 'deep-rooted nature' of some of the factors making women apply for fewer grants, such as the increased likelihood of being on short term junior positions, means that reforms are needed \"to ensure a more equitable distribution of research funding\". Wellcome and the research councils commissioned the National Centre for Social Research to carry out a survey of academic staff. A total of 3090 academic staff drawn from 44 institutions took part in the survey, with a 40% response rate. The survey was commissioned after some suggestions that the mainly male academic referees deciding on research awards were biased against women academics. The survey explored whether there were gender differences in research funding applications activities and identified possible reasons behind these differences. It found that 50% of women and 59% of men in the sample had applied for project research grants in the past five years. And when women applied for funding, they were as successful as their male colleagues: 51% of female and 50% of male applicants had obtained half or more of the grants they had applied for. Virtually no gender differences were found in applications for competitively awarded fellowships: 18% of women and 16% of men in the sample had applied for this type of funding. The survey results also show that women were less likely than men to be eligible to apply for grants provided by all research councils and the Wellcome Trust, except for the Economic and Social Research Council. Women are less likely to be eligible for grants because of their over-representation among lower grade academic staff and those with fixed-term contracts, as many of the grant schemes are not open to academic staff in these groups. The main influences on grant application activities included: job seniority, employment status, tenure, type of institution, and professional profile of academics. There was also a wide variation in the institutional support provided to researchers for funding applications. A break from employment for family reasons in the previous ten years also seems to have a considerable negative influence on grant applications. Grant applications were lower than average among women with dependent children - 50% had applied for grants compared with 62% of men with children.",

One new judge turns up and somehow manages to turn a number of them round,\" he said. He also took a swipe at the government and Lord Burns. \"It was an election pledge and it's not being honoured and it's sad I think to see that one civil servant (Lord Burns) can be appointed to a commission and change things round so dramatically without speaking to us, without ever answering my phone calls.\" The decision over the game's future had first been due in June but delays saw the deadline roll over through the summer until the commission announced in August that neither bid was up to scratch. The commission, under former chairman Dame Helena Shovelton, had originally decided to exclude Camelot from playing any further part in the selection process. Instead, it announced it would hold talks only with organisers of the People's Lottery to iron out shortcomings in their proposals. Camelot took the matter to the high court where the commission's decision was overturned. Dame Helena resigned from her post in October to be replaced by former Treasury mandarin Lord Burns. Sir Richard had claimed his bid would deliver \"hundreds of millions of pounds\" more for good causes. \"That is something I have been passionate about for many years and it is something I believe most people in the country would like to see happen,\" he said this morning.

      "body": "<p>Playing the race card is a phrase we understand. It's a dangerous thing for a politician to do, risking social cohesion for the sake of political advantage. In its common meaning it is always anti-black and/or anti-Asian, and usually involves a political party finding sneaky ways to legitimise such sentiments among white voters. Though the playing of it, these days, is seldom if ever overt, the code may not be hard to crack. It assumes racist sentiments exist, knows the dangers of playing the card face-up, yet reassures the observant voter that his or her sour ethnic feelings are being heeded.</p> <p>But there's another way to play the race card. This is to accuse the other side of playing it when the card is so firmly face-down that hardly anyone would otherwise notice it. That such a tactic may work politically is, in a way, a mark of Britain's social advance. A couple of decades ago, when racial tolerance was less embedded in our society than it is today, there wouldn't have been so much mileage in charging a politician with exploiting covert racism. Perhaps we should applaud the truth exposed by William Hague's inept dabbling in the tragedies of two black boys in south London: that the merest hint of card-playing is utterly unacceptable all round.</p> <p>Yet accusing him of playing it has now had more impact than the words he originally spoke. By calling him \"disgusting\" and \"disgraceful\", Jack Straw did as much to play the card as he did. It was a different suit, but had a worse effect. As well as giving voice to Straw's sound anti-racist record, it was designed to have a political result, namely the portrayal of Hague as a crazed extremist who will stop at nothing to retrieve his desperate situation. The hair-trigger alertness of both prime minister and home secretary, and the hyperbole of their righteous language, was their own playing of the race card. Their purpose was benign. But that, among other things, is what they were doing: making a wild, intemperate noise about race, thereby reminding ethnic and liberal minorities which side they should be on as the election comes closer.</p> <p>Hague's speech was not racist, either in text or, I would say, sub-text. For Straw to call it, on that account, disgusting matches the level of rhetorical subtlety Hague himself achieved when he said the Macpherson report stigmatised all policemen as racists. Macpherson did no such thing. But neither did Hague say anything to justify Bill Morris likening his speech to Enoch Powell talking in 1968 about the rivers of blood that would flow through English cities because of immigration. Morris's charge was grotesquely irresponsible. It was a lot more likely than Hague's words to stir up antagonisms which many good people, including Bill Morris, have spent years working to reduce. On the whole it is the left, by recklessly interpreting Hague as racist, who have raised the temperature more than he did.</p> <p>The Conservative leader is no philosopher-king. He is insensitive and ill- informed about law and order. Some of the things he's prepared to say about the causes of crime, and the remedies he has to offer, are crude in the extreme. His indifference to evidence, scorn for research, and braying confidence in the simplicity of solutions that are being impeded only by the liberal elite, reveal the philistinism of a desperate man. His contention that Britain, with the highest prison population in Europe, has been soft on crime for decades is an assertion too grimly absurd for even the man himself to make any coherent sense of. He merely gesticulates and roars, eyeing opinion polls which say that this may be the one social anxiety voters think Tories are more likely to appease than Labour.</p> <p>Hague is also cavalier with the Macpherson report. Though the Tories were originally supportive, they now misrepresent the report in order to attack it. The finding of institutional racism was a lesson not a threat, and didn't say that every policeman and woman was a racist. It identified an attitude, often unconscious, which police forces as institutions are prone to have, and which many, as a direct result of Macpherson's work, are now doing their best to eradicate. Police leaders have accepted Macpherson. When Hague cites the whinges of individual policemen as proof of a wholesale collapse of morale, he seems to justify their complaints rather than urging them, for the sake of society, to help reform their own social order.</p> <p>Here's where a vestige of racial insinuation could be said, at a stretch, to touch his remarks. But the logical path is tortuous. Stop-and-search, in the wake of Macpherson, has come down: so street crime has gone up: most street crime in south London is done by blacks: therefore, by impeding stop-and-search, the liberal consensus is assisting in the growth of crime and refusing to acknowledge blacks' part in that: and therefore William Hague, by pointing all this out and arguing that it must stop, is pandering to white instincts and showing himself to be a racist. Add the substantial error he made in the use of statistics, and what you have is a leader who has shown himself to be the most sinister and disgraceful politician under the sun.</p> <p>What you have, actually, is a silly man who, when in a hole, doesn't know when to stop digging. With his paragraphs of impeccable political correctness on racial murder and black mistrust of the police, he resembles neither Enoch Powell nor Margaret Thatcher, who played the race card in 1978 by saying it was time to stop the country being \"swamped\" with immigrants. He makes a valid charge about the shortage of policemen, from which people on housing estates, including ethnic minorities, suffer disproportionately much. But he's not alert to the inflammation already set off by his remarks. He ploughs on, gratuitously adding Damilola Taylor to Stephen Lawrence, appropriating their names in his own defence, guaranteeing one more twist in the cycle of outrage. His complacent defiance, in face of the trouble he provoked, is offensive to behold.</p> <p>But it wouldn't have happened if the left, for their part, hadn't fallen into instinctive exaggeration. The most important quality any politician can bring to public discourse on racial issues is scrupulous care with words. That applies both to comment on reality and to the depiction of other people's good or bad faith in dealing with reality. Because, mercifully, racism has become the least acceptable of all modern prejudices, spraying such a charge around needs to be done with a little more care for society than the government propaganda machine, eager to seize its moment, has showed.</p> <p>An attraction of this to ministers was, in a coarse way, political.

      "bodyText": "Playing the race card is a phrase we understand. It's a dangerous thing for a politician to do, risking social cohesion for the sake of political advantage. In its common meaning it is always anti-black and/or anti-Asian, and usually involves a political party finding sneaky ways to legitimise such sentiments among white voters. Though the playing of it, these days, is seldom if ever overt, the code may not be hard to crack. It assumes racist sentiments exist, knows the dangers of playing the card face-up, yet reassures the observant voter that his or her sour ethnic feelings are being heeded. But there's another way to play the race card. This is to accuse the other side of playing it when the card is so firmly face-down that hardly anyone would otherwise notice it. That such a tactic may work politically is, in a way, a mark of Britain's social advance. A couple of decades ago, when racial tolerance was less embedded in our society than it is today, there wouldn't have been so much mileage in charging a politician with exploiting covert racism. Perhaps we should applaud the truth exposed by William Hague's inept dabbling in the tragedies of two black boys in south London: that the merest hint of card-playing is utterly unacceptable all round. Yet accusing him of playing it has now had more impact than the words he originally spoke. By calling him \"disgusting\" and \"disgraceful\", Jack Straw did as much to play the card as he did. It was a different suit, but had a worse effect. As well as giving voice to Straw's sound anti-racist record, it was designed to have a political result, namely the portrayal of Hague as a crazed extremist who will stop at nothing to retrieve his desperate situation. The hair-trigger alertness of both prime minister and home secretary, and the hyperbole of their righteous language, was their own playing of the race card. Their purpose was benign. But that, among other things, is what they were doing: making a wild, intemperate noise about race, thereby reminding ethnic and liberal minorities which side they should be on as the election comes closer. Hague's speech was not racist, either in text or, I would say, sub-text. For Straw to call it, on that account, disgusting matches the level of rhetorical subtlety Hague himself achieved when he said the Macpherson report stigmatised all policemen as racists. Macpherson did no such thing. But neither did Hague say anything to justify Bill Morris likening his speech to Enoch Powell talking in 1968 about the rivers of blood that would flow through English cities because of immigration. Morris's charge was grotesquely irresponsible. It was a lot more likely than Hague's words to stir up antagonisms which many good people, including Bill Morris, have spent years working to reduce. On the whole it is the left, by recklessly interpreting Hague as racist, who have raised the temperature more than he did. The Conservative leader is no philosopher-king. He is insensitive and ill- informed about law and order. Some of the things he's prepared to say about the causes of crime, and the remedies he has to offer, are crude in the extreme. His indifference to evidence, scorn for research, and braying confidence in the simplicity of solutions that are being impeded only by the liberal elite, reveal the philistinism of a desperate man. His contention that Britain, with the highest prison population in Europe, has been soft on crime for decades is an assertion too grimly absurd for even the man himself to make any coherent sense of. He merely gesticulates and roars, eyeing opinion polls which say that this may be the one social anxiety voters think Tories are more likely to appease than Labour. Hague is also cavalier with the Macpherson report. Though the Tories were originally supportive, they now misrepresent the report in order to attack it. The finding of institutional racism was a lesson not a threat, and didn't say that every policeman and woman was a racist. It identified an attitude, often unconscious, which police forces as institutions are prone to have, and which many, as a direct result of Macpherson's work, are now doing their best to eradicate. Police leaders have accepted Macpherson. When Hague cites the whinges of individual policemen as proof of a wholesale collapse of morale, he seems to justify their complaints rather than urging them, for the sake of society, to help reform their own social order. Here's where a vestige of racial insinuation could be said, at a stretch, to touch his remarks. But the logical path is tortuous. Stop-and-search, in the wake of Macpherson, has come down: so street crime has gone up: most street crime in south London is done by blacks: therefore, by impeding stop-and-search, the liberal consensus is assisting in the growth of crime and refusing to acknowledge blacks' part in that: and therefore William Hague, by pointing all this out and arguing that it must stop, is pandering to white instincts and showing himself to be a racist. Add the substantial error he made in the use of statistics, and what you have is a leader who has shown himself to be the most sinister and disgraceful politician under the sun. What you have, actually, is a silly man who, when in a hole, doesn't know when to stop digging. With his paragraphs of impeccable political correctness on racial murder and black mistrust of the police, he resembles neither Enoch Powell nor Margaret Thatcher, who played the race card in 1978 by saying it was time to stop the country being \"swamped\" with immigrants. He makes a valid charge about the shortage of policemen, from which people on housing estates, including ethnic minorities, suffer disproportionately much. But he's not alert to the inflammation already set off by his remarks. He ploughs on, gratuitously adding Damilola Taylor to Stephen Lawrence, appropriating their names in his own defence, guaranteeing one more twist in the cycle of outrage. His complacent defiance, in face of the trouble he provoked, is offensive to behold. But it wouldn't have happened if the left, for their part, hadn't fallen into instinctive exaggeration. The most important quality any politician can bring to public discourse on racial issues is scrupulous care with words. That applies both to comment on reality and to the depiction of other people's good or bad faith in dealing with reality. Because, mercifully, racism has become the least acceptable of all modern prejudices, spraying such a charge around needs to be done with a little more care for society than the government propaganda machine, eager to seize its moment, has showed. An attraction of this to ministers was, in a coarse way, political. Leaping to attack Hague as a racist, they could distract attention from their own failures as liberals. They may not have done much for civil liberties, but they're clean on this one. A feeling of virtue grips them. So, they must hope, will the constituency that deplores their reactionary record. But hyperbole, in this tinder-box, exacts a high price. hugoyoung@compuserve.com",

      "bodyText": "The ecstasy honeymoon may be over for British users who have become disenchanted with the mood-changing drug that became a staple for nightclub goers and ravers, researchers will suggest today. British ecstasy users report fewer benefits and more drawbacks than their American counterparts. They are more likely to have criminal convictions, are typically older and have taken the drug for longer. Yet they are also far less likely to take precautions, such as drinking plenty of non-alcoholic liquids, to reduce potential problems, according to researchers at Edgehill college of higher education, Ormskirk, Lancashire, and Liverpool John Moores University. \"British users appear to be more complacent,\" they will say in a paper to be presented at a conference of the British Psychological Society in London. The authors, Michelle Wareing, Philip Murphy and John Fisk, suggest the fact that Britain set the pace for use of ecstasy as a mainstream drug may be an explanation for the differences with the US. \"British users seem to have already gone through their honeymoon period and are now perhaps entering a period of disenchantment.\" More than nine in 10 American users told researchers they liked to dance under the influence, compared with 73% of Britons. Britons were also more likely to report problems such as short term memory loss, lack of motivation and tiredness. Other papers to the conference will reveal that psychiatric problems linked to the use of recreational drugs are more prevalent among heavy ecstasy users .",

And that was scored by Mark Stein, for Christ's sake. He went to Crystal Palace (enough said). He went to Nottingham Forest and signed Pierre van Hooijdonk (oops). And now - will his pain never end? - he's been relieved of his duties as manager of Barnsley.</p> <p>The club released a statement today which read: \"Following a long discussion about the way forward for Barnsley Football Club and David Bassett, the board of directors have reluctantly agreed with David that there be a parting of the ways. The directors would like to place on record their thanks to David Bassett for all his hard blah drone blether to be perfectly honest we're surprised you've kept reading this story long enough to notice we're not actually quoting the press release any more, and can you really blame us, because these things are invariably painfully tedious and they always end with the words 'wish him and his family all the very best in the future'.\"</p> <p>Poor old Harry - who was, along with his family, wished all the very best in the future - had only been in the job 17 months, and he was quite successful too. He took the irritatingly monickered Tykes to the only remaining exciting game in the English football calendar before losing to Ipswich, which is not bad going when you think about it.

Students in 1998-99 had 12% more income in real terms compared to those studying in 1995-96. But 87% of the latter-day students complained about financial difficulties. The results come from the Department for Education and Employment\u0092s student debt survey, carried out every three years. While the students in 1998-99 were among the first to be charged tuition fees in universities, maintenance grants for living costs were phased out the following year.",

      "body": "<p>1. The National Lottery Commission has decided to award Camelot Group plc the next seven-year licence to run the National Lottery. This statement discharges the duty of the Commission to give reasons for its decision under paragraph 9 of Schedule 2A of the National Lottery etc. Act 1993 as amended (\"the Act\"). </p> <p>2. The Commission has made a detailed evaluation of the bids from Camelot and The People's Lottery in the form in which the bidders have revised them to meet the Commission's concerns as set out in its statement of 23 August 2000. Statement of Reasons for the Decision of the National Lottery Commission not to Grant a Licence to Operate the National Lottery, 23 August 2000. The People's Lottery was given a month to submit its revised proposals and did so on 23 September. Camelot submitted its revised proposals on 24 October after the High Court's decision that it should have a similar opportunity to allay the Commission's concerns. </p> <p>3. The Commission has considered the bids in the light of the factors that it listed in The Invitation to Apply. Invitation to Apply, November 1999, especially chapter 4. It has looked at the bids afresh and without regard to any earlier provisional conclusions that it might have reached, whether on returns to the National Lottery Distribution Fund (NLDF) or on any other issues. New Lottery Bids Go to the Next Stage, 10 November 2000. The bidders were told that the Commission would take account of changes intended to rectify the original bids as they stood on 23 August in the areas of concern that the Commission had identified. Apart from that, the Commission would only take account of such changes as were necessarily incidental or consequential to the main changes. The only changes that the Commission has identified as falling into this category are certain potential increases in costs for The People's Lottery resulting from its proposed trust fund arrangements and those for an additional financial facility. The Commission has concluded that these costs are not material to its evaluation. </p> <p>4. Since the National Lottery began in November 1994, it has become a national institution. It has also become one of the largest lotteries in the world in terms of sales, with a high proportion of households playing each week. Sales during the present licence period have averaged \u00a35.0 billion at an annual rate, with total contributions so far to the NLDF of over \u00a39 billion. The cumulative total of sales to date is \u00a330.4 billion. The total given for contributions excludes interest earned by the NLDF.</p> <p><strong>The qualifying statutory criteria</strong></p> <p>5. When the Commission announced on 10 November 2000 that it would evaluate both bids, it said that each now had the potential to meet the criteria in section 4(1) of the Act. These concern the running of the National Lottery with all due propriety and the protection of the interests of every participant. The Commission has concluded that as a result of the changes made since 23 August 2000 both bids now meet these criteria. </p> <p><br>\u0095 For Camelot, the Commission reached this conclusion after considering Camelot's proposals to buy out the UK operations of GTech Corporation and noting progress made so far by Camelot and GTech on implementing commitments made to the Commission in the light of a software incident during the course of the first licence.</p> <p><br>\u0095 For The People's Lottery, the Commission has reached this conclusion after considering The People's Lottery's trust fund proposals. The Commission is satisfied that these proposals would ensure that all outstanding prizes would be paid and that all ticket holders would be reimbursed in the event of the failure of the licensee.</p> <p><strong>Maximising proceeds for the NLDF</strong></p> <p>6. Provided that the qualifying statutory criteria are satisfied, section 4(2) of the Act requires the Commission in exercising its functions to do its best to secure that the net proceeds of the National Lottery are as great as possible. In making its assessment the Commission has taken account both of forecasts of returns to the NLDF and of the risks associated with the bids.</p> <p>7. The Commission has concluded that the uncertainty relating to achievable sales is greater with The People's Lottery than with Camelot. There are also greater risks in The People's Lottery's bid as regards costs and financial soundness. These risks combine with those that would inevitably arise from a change of operator. </p> <p>8. Although The People's Lottery offers higher contributions to the NLDF than Camelot at the same sales levels, this factor is outweighed by two considerations. The first is that the Commission has concluded that Camelot is on balance likely to deliver more sales over the licence period than The People's Lottery. The second is that the accumulation of risks that is inherent in The People's Lottery's bid, particularly in the early stages, is uncomfortably high by comparison with those posed by Camelot's bid. </p> <p>9. The remainder of this statement sets out more fully the Commission's assessment of the main factors that it has weighed in reaching its conclusion that the prospect of maximising the likely proceeds for the NLDF is greater with Camelot's bid than it is with The People's Lottery's. </p> <p><strong>Ability to operate the National Lottery</strong></p> <p>10. The Commission has concluded that Camelot will be able to operate the National Lottery satisfactorily after it has absorbed GTech's UK operations. In reaching this conclusion, the Commission has taken account of the additional responsibilities and risks for management that will result from the change.</p> <p>11. Camelot's IT systems overall have demonstrated a high level of operational reliability. The Commission notes that the proposed gaming software is not as up-to-date as the version currently being introduced in many other lottery jurisdictions and that this may involve some risk in the longer term as regards maintenance, development and adaptability.</p> <p>12. The Commission considers that a largely outsourced operation, such as that proposed by The People's Lottery, is capable of providing a suitable structure for running the National Lottery. However, the Commission is concerned that The People's Lottery might not have sufficiently recognised the resources required for the management tasks involved in start-up and subsequent operation. </p> <p>13. The IT systems proposed by The People's Lottery are more modern than those proposed by Camelot. The Commission considers that they would have had considerable potential to benefit the National Lottery if The People's Lottery had been chosen as the preferred bidder. </p> <p>14. The Commission does not regard the risks associated with a change of operator and systems as in themselves preventing it from awarding the licence to a new operator. It considers that a change of both operator and systems must be accepted as a possible consequence of the legislation. It believes that such a change can in principle be managed successfully, even though clear precedents on the scale of the National Lottery are lacking. However, the Commission has concluded that the risks presented in this area by The People's Lottery are considerable when combined with other risks involved in the bid. By comparison, the risks in terms of systems in Camelot's bid are likely to be more important in the later stages of the licence and the Commission considers them to be less critical.</p> <p><strong>Game plans</strong></p> <p>15. Camelot intends to continue with the 6/49 matrix for the main online game and to conduct a phased introduction of new games. The Commission notes that the portfolio of online games has proved popular in its present form. In contrast, Camelot's record on Instants has, after an initial successful period, been disappointing and the Commission has reservations about Camelot's plans for them. The Commission is also uncertain whether the Euro Bloc game proposed by Camelot would be capable of introduction within the proposed licence period, given the practical difficulties involved.</p> <p>16. The People's Lottery proposes to increase the size of the matrix for the main online game from 6/49 to 6/53. The Commission accepts that there is an argument for doing this, given the large number of National Lottery players and the small number of rollovers that the present matrix generates. The proposed change should result in a larger number of rollovers, which in itself might well increase player appeal. However, the longer odds might equally cause some players to defer purchases until rollovers occur. The experience of other lotteries with regard to a matrix change is mixed and, because of the difficulty of isolating the impact of a matrix change from other variables, inconclusive. On the evidence available, including that provided by The People's Lottery, the Commission is not convinced that a change would have a positive net effect on sales, having regard to the risks involved. </p> <p>17. The Commission also has some concerns about the ability of The People's Lottery to manage delivery of the considerable number of new games that it proposes to introduce at the start of the licence, particularly given all the other elements of start-up that need to be delivered. The Commission considers that The People's Lottery may have assumed too much in terms of players' willingness to adapt to changes in the current games and to take part in new ones. The Commission is also unconvinced that the Regional game as proposed by the People's Lottery would be workable.</p> <p>18. The Commission has concluded that The People's Lottery offers some advantages over Camelot in its game plan proposals, notably with regard to Instants. However, there are considerable risks in combining a matrix change with the early introduction of many new games. The Commission also notes that The People's Lottery's plans for new media are comparatively undeveloped. The Commission is not persuaded that The People's Lottery's game plan is superior to that of Camelot and considers that it involves greater risks.</p> <p><strong>Expected sales</strong></p> <p>19. The bidders' principal forecasts show average annual sales over the licence period of \u00a37.3 billion in the case of Camelot and \u00a37.4 billion in the case of The People's Lottery. However, actual sales have varied between \u00a34.5 and \u00a35.6 billion over the first licence period. Based on a 52 week moving average. They are currently running at some \u00a35 billion a year.</p> <p>20. The Commission considers that both bidders are over-optimistic about the level of sales that they would achieve. Neither bidder has in the Commission's view satisfactorily addressed the question of how far sales of new games would displace sales of existing games. Nor have they satisfactorily addressed the issue of competition from outside the National Lottery. Having considered the evidence, including that in the bidders' proposals, the Commission is not persuaded that there is likely to be a step-change in sales over the next licence period. It has concluded that sales are more likely to be within the range achieved during the first licence period.</p> <p>21. The Commission regards the level of potential sales by The People's Lottery as more uncertain than is the case with Camelot. The People's Lottery has the potential to increase sales by relaunching the National Lottery but its game plan relies heavily on the success of the matrix change and the early introduction of new games. The Commission found The People's Lottery's market research and overall marketing plan to be less convincing than Camelot's. The research provided by The People's Lottery does not in the Commission's view support its claim that by not itself taking profit it would produce a significant increase in sales. The Commission has concluded that Camelot is, on balance, likely to deliver more sales over the licence period than The People's Lottery.</p> <p><strong>Contributions to the NLDF</strong></p> <p>22. At the same sales levels the commitments offered by The People's Lottery would lead to larger contributions to the NLDF than would Camelot's. At the bidders' principal forecasts, in which The People's Lottery's sales figures are higher than Camelot's, The People's Lottery would contribute some \u00a3160 million more a year than Camelot. At sales of \u00a35 billion a year The People's Lottery would contribute some \u00a3110 million more a year than Camelot. These figures are based on the bidders' own cost assumptions. They would be affected by The People's Lottery's cost performance, as they take account of a secondary contribution to the NLDF that consists of any surplus that The People's Lottery generates. Camelot proposes to pay a secondary contribution equivalent to one half of any excess of after-tax profits over the level in its principal forecast. </p> <p> 23. Although the differences given above are substantial in themselves, they are small in relation to the range of uncertainties surrounding the projections and the total amounts at stake. Relatively small movements in sales by either Camelot or The People's Lottery would lead to a reversal of the ranking.</p> <p><strong>Costs</strong></p> <p>24. The costs that The People's Lottery has included in its bid are significantly lower than those included by Camelot. In absolute terms, the biggest difference is for IT systems. The Commission accepts that this difference is explicable.</p> <p>25. However, having examined the cost proposals of both bidders, the Commission considers that there is a risk that The People's Lottery may have underestimated other costs, particularly at lower levels of sales. In addition, The People's Lottery's proposed provision for expenditure on new media appears to be low. The Commission's concerns are increased because The People's Lottery has not made express provision for contingencies, which would be usual in such circumstances.</p> <p>26. If the Commission's concerns proved well founded, the effect would be to reduce the extent to which Camelot needs to generate higher sales than The People's Lottery to produce the same amount of contributions for the NLDF. It would also increase the prospect of The People's Lottery going into financial deficit. </p> <p><strong>Financial soundness</strong> </p> <p>27. The Commission considers that Camelot would be profitable on all the sales scenarios that the Commission has examined and that the risk of it becoming loss making is low.</p> <p>28. Once The People's Lottery has repaid its initial term loan, it intends to pass all accounting profits to the NLDF year by year. There is no provision to build up reserves as a cushion against any future deficits. </p> <p>29. The additional \u00a350 million facility obtained by The People's Lottery since August provides it with increased headroom to deal with short-term cashflow requirements and could help The People's Lottery in lower revenue scenarios. However, the repayment conditions have led the Commission to conclude that the facility would only give limited assistance if there were continuing losses. </p> <p>30. Given The People's Lottery's commitments to the NLDF, there is a much greater risk than with Camelot that its financial position would become vulnerable at low levels of sales or if there were unplanned costs, such as those that might arise from unexpected problems in start-up. The full extent of the risk cannot be evaluated with precision. The Commission considers, however, that at levels of sales not far below \u00a35 billion a year there is a real risk that The People's Lottery could incur losses which would not be sustainable within its proposed financial structure. The critical point would be reached at a higher level of sales if there were unexpected costs. </p> <p><strong>Conclusion</strong> </p> <p>31. In the light of the considerations set out above, the Commission has concluded that the prospects of maximising the likely proceeds for the NLDF are greater with Camelot's bid than with that of The People's Lottery.</p>",

The Commission considers that a largely outsourced operation, such as that proposed by The People's Lottery, is capable of providing a suitable structure for running the National Lottery. However, the Commission is concerned that The People's Lottery might not have sufficiently recognised the resources required for the management tasks involved in start-up and subsequent operation. 13. The IT systems proposed by The People's Lottery are more modern than those proposed by Camelot. The Commission considers that they would have had considerable potential to benefit the National Lottery if The People's Lottery had been chosen as the preferred bidder. 14. The Commission does not regard the risks associated with a change of operator and systems as in themselves preventing it from awarding the licence to a new operator. It considers that a change of both operator and systems must be accepted as a possible consequence of the legislation. It believes that such a change can in principle be managed successfully, even though clear precedents on the scale of the National Lottery are lacking. However, the Commission has concluded that the risks presented in this area by The People's Lottery are considerable when combined with other risks involved in the bid. By comparison, the risks in terms of systems in Camelot's bid are likely to be more important in the later stages of the licence and the Commission considers them to be less critical. Game plans 15. Camelot intends to continue with the 6/49 matrix for the main online game and to conduct a phased introduction of new games. The Commission notes that the portfolio of online games has proved popular in its present form. In contrast, Camelot's record on Instants has, after an initial successful period, been disappointing and the Commission has reservations about Camelot's plans for them. The Commission is also uncertain whether the Euro Bloc game proposed by Camelot would be capable of introduction within the proposed licence period, given the practical difficulties involved. 16. The People's Lottery proposes to increase the size of the matrix for the main online game from 6/49 to 6/53. The Commission accepts that there is an argument for doing this, given the large number of National Lottery players and the small number of rollovers that the present matrix generates. The proposed change should result in a larger number of rollovers, which in itself might well increase player appeal. However, the longer odds might equally cause some players to defer purchases until rollovers occur. The experience of other lotteries with regard to a matrix change is mixed and, because of the difficulty of isolating the impact of a matrix change from other variables, inconclusive. On the evidence available, including that provided by The People's Lottery, the Commission is not convinced that a change would have a positive net effect on sales, having regard to the risks involved. 17. The Commission also has some concerns about the ability of The People's Lottery to manage delivery of the considerable number of new games that it proposes to introduce at the start of the licence, particularly given all the other elements of start-up that need to be delivered. The Commission considers that The People's Lottery may have assumed too much in terms of players' willingness to adapt to changes in the current games and to take part in new ones. The Commission is also unconvinced that the Regional game as proposed by the People's Lottery would be workable. 18. The Commission has concluded that The People's Lottery offers some advantages over Camelot in its game plan proposals, notably with regard to Instants. However, there are considerable risks in combining a matrix change with the early introduction of many new games. The Commission also notes that The People's Lottery's plans for new media are comparatively undeveloped. The Commission is not persuaded that The People's Lottery's game plan is superior to that of Camelot and considers that it involves greater risks. Expected sales 19. The bidders' principal forecasts show average annual sales over the licence period of \u00a37.3 billion in the case of Camelot and \u00a37.4 billion in the case of The People's Lottery. However, actual sales have varied between \u00a34.5 and \u00a35.6 billion over the first licence period. Based on a 52 week moving average. They are currently running at some \u00a35 billion a year. 20. The Commission considers that both bidders are over-optimistic about the level of sales that they would achieve. Neither bidder has in the Commission's view satisfactorily addressed the question of how far sales of new games would displace sales of existing games. Nor have they satisfactorily addressed the issue of competition from outside the National Lottery. Having considered the evidence, including that in the bidders' proposals, the Commission is not persuaded that there is likely to be a step-change in sales over the next licence period. It has concluded that sales are more likely to be within the range achieved during the first licence period. 21. The Commission regards the level of potential sales by The People's Lottery as more uncertain than is the case with Camelot. The People's Lottery has the potential to increase sales by relaunching the National Lottery but its game plan relies heavily on the success of the matrix change and the early introduction of new games. The Commission found The People's Lottery's market research and overall marketing plan to be less convincing than Camelot's. The research provided by The People's Lottery does not in the Commission's view support its claim that by not itself taking profit it would produce a significant increase in sales. The Commission has concluded that Camelot is, on balance, likely to deliver more sales over the licence period than The People's Lottery. Contributions to the NLDF 22. At the same sales levels the commitments offered by The People's Lottery would lead to larger contributions to the NLDF than would Camelot's. At the bidders' principal forecasts, in which The People's Lottery's sales figures are higher than Camelot's, The People's Lottery would contribute some \u00a3160 million more a year than Camelot. At sales of \u00a35 billion a year The People's Lottery would contribute some \u00a3110 million more a year than Camelot. These figures are based on the bidders' own cost assumptions. They would be affected by The People's Lottery's cost performance, as they take account of a secondary contribution to the NLDF that consists of any surplus that The People's Lottery generates. Camelot proposes to pay a secondary contribution equivalent to one half of any excess of after-tax profits over the level in its principal forecast. 23. Although the differences given above are substantial in themselves, they are small in relation to the range of uncertainties surrounding the projections and the total amounts at stake. Relatively small movements in sales by either Camelot or The People's Lottery would lead to a reversal of the ranking. Costs 24. The costs that The People's Lottery has included in its bid are significantly lower than those included by Camelot. In absolute terms, the biggest difference is for IT systems. The Commission accepts that this difference is explicable. 25. However, having examined the cost proposals of both bidders, the Commission considers that there is a risk that The People's Lottery may have underestimated other costs, particularly at lower levels of sales. In addition, The People's Lottery's proposed provision for expenditure on new media appears to be low. The Commission's concerns are increased because The People's Lottery has not made express provision for contingencies, which would be usual in such circumstances. 26. If the Commission's concerns proved well founded, the effect would be to reduce the extent to which Camelot needs to generate higher sales than The People's Lottery to produce the same amount of contributions for the NLDF. It would also increase the prospect of The People's Lottery going into financial deficit. Financial soundness 27. The Commission considers that Camelot would be profitable on all the sales scenarios that the Commission has examined and that the risk of it becoming loss making is low. 28. Once The People's Lottery has repaid its initial term loan, it intends to pass all accounting profits to the NLDF year by year. There is no provision to build up reserves as a cushion against any future deficits. 29. The additional \u00a350 million facility obtained by The People's Lottery since August provides it with increased headroom to deal with short-term cashflow requirements and could help The People's Lottery in lower revenue scenarios. However, the repayment conditions have led the Commission to conclude that the facility would only give limited assistance if there were continuing losses. 30. Given The People's Lottery's commitments to the NLDF, there is a much greater risk than with Camelot that its financial position would become vulnerable at low levels of sales or if there were unplanned costs, such as those that might arise from unexpected problems in start-up. The full extent of the risk cannot be evaluated with precision. The Commission considers, however, that at levels of sales not far below \u00a35 billion a year there is a real risk that The People's Lottery could incur losses which would not be sustainable within its proposed financial structure. The critical point would be reached at a higher level of sales if there were unexpected costs. Conclusion 31. In the light of the considerations set out above, the Commission has concluded that the prospects of maximising the likely proceeds for the NLDF are greater with Camelot's bid than with that of The People's Lottery.",

      "trailText": "<p>Lu Youqing, who died last week, broke with centuries of Chinese tradition to write frankly about his cancer. His online diary touched thousands, reports  <strong>John Gittings</strong>.</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Lu Youqing had made a date with death, publicly on a Shanghai website and then repeatedly over the last months of his life in open letters to his \"web friends\". When he died from cancer on December 11 - the notice appeared first on the site - hundreds of readers posted messages, mostly in sorrow but some in hope. \"It is you who have cured us of diseases ...\" wrote one. \"In today's world, your diary is like a breath of refreshing wind.\" </p> <p>Lu's self-revealing letters, which were published in book form shortly before he died, have established a new standard for honesty in a society where reticence and considerations of face inhibit frank discussion of illness and death. </p> <p>Lu, 37, was a former journalist with a degree in Chinese literature who, like many young intellectuals in the new era of \"economic reform\", went into business. He leaves behind his wife and 10-year-old daughter. His story, which was reported on China's main television stations and newspapers, and discussed on many other websites, has also focused attention on the rising incidence of cancer in China and the paucity of adequate treatment. </p> <p>Most of Lu's last thoughts were gentle memories of happier times and wry reflections about the attention he was attracting. But he had harsh comments to make about overcrowded wards in which a bribe is often the only way to get quick treatment. He described the grim plight of \"the cancer patient from outside the city, living in a small hotel beside the Shanghai tumour hospital, taking all the family savings with him and waiting for a sick bed and operation\". </p> <p>He also noted how Chinese society still ostracises those who are marked by misfortune. \"From the moment you pick up a lab report stating that the doctor has diagnosed cancerous cells,\" Lu wrote, \"life starts to get tough. If you're an official your career will stop dead, the personnel department will start looking for your successor and people will start positioning themselves to replace you ... If you're a business man, your credit will suddenly be devalued ... If you're a student you may give up your studies.\" </p> <p>The medical authorities say that cancerous tumour cases are rising sharply. Not surprisingly in a country with high tobacco consumption, lung cancer remains the commonest form: the death rate from it is the highest of any developing country. </p> <p>This year a national conference on tumour prevention was told that cancer now causes one out of every five deaths in China. Annual cancer-related deaths now total 1.3m a year. Advocates of healthy eating in the west have held out China as a model society with a high consumption of naturally unrefined plant food and a low consumption of animal protein. Both were thought to explain the country's low rates of cancer and cardiovascular disease.

      "bodyText": "Lu Youqing had made a date with death, publicly on a Shanghai website and then repeatedly over the last months of his life in open letters to his \"web friends\". When he died from cancer on December 11 - the notice appeared first on the site - hundreds of readers posted messages, mostly in sorrow but some in hope. \"It is you who have cured us of diseases ...\" wrote one. \"In today's world, your diary is like a breath of refreshing wind.\" Lu's self-revealing letters, which were published in book form shortly before he died, have established a new standard for honesty in a society where reticence and considerations of face inhibit frank discussion of illness and death. Lu, 37, was a former journalist with a degree in Chinese literature who, like many young intellectuals in the new era of \"economic reform\", went into business. He leaves behind his wife and 10-year-old daughter. His story, which was reported on China's main television stations and newspapers, and discussed on many other websites, has also focused attention on the rising incidence of cancer in China and the paucity of adequate treatment. Most of Lu's last thoughts were gentle memories of happier times and wry reflections about the attention he was attracting. But he had harsh comments to make about overcrowded wards in which a bribe is often the only way to get quick treatment. He described the grim plight of \"the cancer patient from outside the city, living in a small hotel beside the Shanghai tumour hospital, taking all the family savings with him and waiting for a sick bed and operation\". He also noted how Chinese society still ostracises those who are marked by misfortune. \"From the moment you pick up a lab report stating that the doctor has diagnosed cancerous cells,\" Lu wrote, \"life starts to get tough. If you're an official your career will stop dead, the personnel department will start looking for your successor and people will start positioning themselves to replace you ... If you're a business man, your credit will suddenly be devalued ... If you're a student you may give up your studies.\" The medical authorities say that cancerous tumour cases are rising sharply. Not surprisingly in a country with high tobacco consumption, lung cancer remains the commonest form: the death rate from it is the highest of any developing country. This year a national conference on tumour prevention was told that cancer now causes one out of every five deaths in China. Annual cancer-related deaths now total 1.3m a year. Advocates of healthy eating in the west have held out China as a model society with a high consumption of naturally unrefined plant food and a low consumption of animal protein. Both were thought to explain the country's low rates of cancer and cardiovascular disease. But Chinese specialists say that changes towards a less healthy diet and a less active lifestyle - the consequence of economic improvements in the past 20 years - have raised rates of the two degenerative illnesses dramatically. Stomach cancer has always been an exception with far higher rates recorded in China than in the West. This has often been blamed upon the widespread reliance on fermented and salted preserved vegetables in rural areas. Lu decided to keep and publish a diary both as a way of confronting death and to leave behind a memorial for his wife and daughter. After five years of cancer treatment, including two operations, a malignant tumour appeared on Lu's neck which grew rapidly. In February he was told he had only three months left to live: he decided to give up taking medicine and start writing instead. \"People should choose their own way ...\" he wrote. \"This is my way of defying death and keeping my dignity.\" He neither dwelt on his illness nor avoided it, but wove it naturally into the narrative.

Almost everyone there was skinny and many were 'cross addicted' - to alcohol, or drugs, or both.\" Sandy never went back - \"There were too many religious overtones\" (she remembers a lot of talk of \"God as I see him\") - and while her eating was problematic, she didn't want a new life. </p> <p>Overeaters Anonymous is not a diet. It's more a support group for \"addicts\". \"Support groups,\" Beglin agrees, \"can certainly be helpful. Most people who binge eat do it in private. They feel disgusted with themselves. A big part of group therapy is being with others who share your secret.\" But the real key to OA seems to be a desperation to change. \"Success in OA,\" writes one member in Lifeline, \"requires a willingness to change. That is what the 12 steps of OA are all about - a systematic way of changing the way we think and live, so we don't have to act like practicing compulsive over-eaters.\" </p> <p>It would be all too easy to knock Geri for showing up at an OA meeting. Self-help groups always sound barmy and this one's got a silly name too. But what can we really know about someone's internal battle with food? If a person feels so out of control that they want to turn to God (as they know him) and remodel their life forever then why shouldn't they? </p> <p>\"I can honestly say,\" writes one OA member, \"that I love myself today. Thank you, OA and my Higher Power.\" Such people may not be much of a laugh at parties, but going to an OA meeting is probably - at the very least - preferable to vomiting, starving or bingeing alone at home.</p>",

The corporation has submitted proposals for a new broadcasting, presentation and transmission centre, a new home for the BBC Symphony Orchestra, BBC Singers and BBC Symphony Chorus. The centre will also house a shopping and leisure centre and accommodation for other media organisations in a development that has echoes of the recently aborted plans for a new national stadium. Today the BBC was stressing that it would not be using licence payers money for the eight-building development. And it said it would farm out the running of the leisure centre to a private firm. More than \u00a3200m of private investment is expected to go into the media village development on Wood Lane. John Smith, BBC director of finance and business affairs, said: \"With the proposed new shopping centre at Shepherds Bush, Wood Lane is undergoing a transformation. \"We want to help that process by giving people reasons to visit us, to feel the thrill of a lively broadcasting centre and enjoy the facilities of a thriving neighbourhood.\" The 131,000 square metre site around the BBC's existing White City complex, which will house up to 6,000 staff, is to be developed by the property joint venture for which the corporation is in the process of finding a commercial partner. Two consortia, Insight and Foresite, have been shortlisted to become the BBC's property partner. Insight is backed by Trillium and Land Securities, while Foresite has been formed by Amey Ventures, Barclays Private Equity and Arrowcroft Group. The BBC spokeswoman said one of the two was expected to be selected as a preferred bidder by February, with final contract details finalised by spring 2001. The first BBC staff are expected to move into the media village in 2003 and the complex is scheduled for completion in 2007. Three-quarters of the accommodation will be for BBC staff, but the corporation is also planning to offer premises to other media companies. In addition, the BBC is proposing to build a leisure centre and shops that will be open to local residents as part of moves to develop closer links with the local community. The BBC has submitted a planning application to Hammersmith and Fulham Council.",

The objective is to exploit America's growing fear that innocent people are ending up on death row.</p> <p>The Rome-based Community of Sant'Egidio, an independent Roman Catholic group which promotes peace in Africa and the Balkans, organised the petition.</p> <p>It said the death penalty dehumanised the world by putting vengeance first.</p> <p>The signatories include the Dalai Lama; the Indonesian president, Abdurrahman Wahid; the Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey; the writer Umberto Eco; the film director Roberto Benigni; and the World Methodist Council president, Frances Alguire.</p> <p>Sister Helen Prejean, author of the book Dead Man Walking, told Mr Annan that the petition was aimed at the estimated 90 countries where capital punishment remains legal.</p> <p>Executions are common in China, Iraq, India, Iran, Pakistan, the Palestinian Authority territories, Saudi Arabia and Nigeria.</p> <p>More than 660 people have been executed in the US since the death penalty was reintroduced in 1976. It is supported by two out of three Americans.</p> <p>As Texas governor, Mr Bush backed a law to shorten delays between convictions and executions, blocked a bill to ban the execution of people with learning disabilities, and presided over the first execu tion of a woman since the civil war.

      "bodyText": "Opponents of the death penalty opened a political front against the next US president, George W Bush, yesterday by presenting the United Nations with a petition of 3.2m signatures from 146 countries. A coalition of intellectuals, entertainers and religious and human rights groups said the petition marked a stepping-up in the campaign for moratoriums on capital punishment. The petition was handed to the UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, in New York, but its focus was on Mr Bush, who has approved more executions than any other US governor in modern times during his tenure in Texas. The objective is to exploit America's growing fear that innocent people are ending up on death row. The Rome-based Community of Sant'Egidio, an independent Roman Catholic group which promotes peace in Africa and the Balkans, organised the petition. It said the death penalty dehumanised the world by putting vengeance first. The signatories include the Dalai Lama; the Indonesian president, Abdurrahman Wahid; the Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey; the writer Umberto Eco; the film director Roberto Benigni; and the World Methodist Council president, Frances Alguire. Sister Helen Prejean, author of the book Dead Man Walking, told Mr Annan that the petition was aimed at the estimated 90 countries where capital punishment remains legal. Executions are common in China, Iraq, India, Iran, Pakistan, the Palestinian Authority territories, Saudi Arabia and Nigeria. More than 660 people have been executed in the US since the death penalty was reintroduced in 1976. It is supported by two out of three Americans. As Texas governor, Mr Bush backed a law to shorten delays between convictions and executions, blocked a bill to ban the execution of people with learning disabilities, and presided over the first execu tion of a woman since the civil war. Overseeing more than 150 deaths did his popularity no harm. Sant'Egidio senses that this campaign against the death penalty may succeed where others failed because of revelations about incompetent defence lawyers and dishonest prosecutors and police officers, and the fact that a disproportionate number of black and Hispanic convicts have been condemned. In January the Illinois governor, George Ryan, imposed a moratorium after 13 death-row inmates were shown to have been wrongly convicted. Such scandals have rattled confidence in the system. The Pope is expected to use his new year message to the world to once again condemn capital punishment. Italy's opposition was highlighted this year when the Colosseum in Rome was bathed in light for 48 hours every time a death penalty was suspended or commuted or a country abolished capital punishment. The ceremony ends this month.

      "body": "<p>From the Tannoy of Finsbury Park station comes a familiar message. The 8.33pm to Hertford North has been cancelled. The three middle-aged men, accompanied by one young boy, have an hour to kill and there is only one thing for it. \"Let's go to the pub,\" says one. \"These bloody trains will drive you to drink.\" They will also drive you with drink. </p> <p>The majority of those who board the next train are carrying bottles of beer. About a quarter of the carriage is drunk. When we arrive at Stevenage the walkway between the town centre and the leisure park, a thoroughfare between town and clubland, teenage boys clutch pints of lager as though they were tickets to manhood. </p> <p>It's Saturday night and you can almost hear the drum beats of a primal British ritual pounding. It's time for the smallest market town and the largest urban centre to bury their differences in a sea of beer and Bacardi Breezers. By the end of the night, young women with glazed eyes will link arms and sing anything from Frank Sinatra to The Wizard of Oz; young men will support themselves against the nearest immovable object and then urinate on it. It's Saturday night: time to \"get hammered\", \"blasted\" and \"go mad for it\". It's time, in short, for alcohol to take over. </p> <p>\"British social culture is built around drink,\" says Eric Appleby of Alcohol Concern. \"If you're going to meet people after work you meet them in a pub. If you're going out for a chat you'll go to a pub and in the pub there is a macho thing about how many drinks you've had. Drinking alcohol then becomes the primary social activity.\" </p> <p>So while the social scenes of most American sitcoms, such as Seinfeld, Friends or Frasier, take place in coffee bars and diners, all English soap characters like to mull over their problems at the Woolpack, the Rovers Return or the Queen Vic. If Jim Davidson, the comedian and Tory MC, wants to impress his colleague and co-star, the TV presenter Suzi Perry, he falls off the wagon and drinks himself silly. \"As soon as I saw her I fell in love with her,\" he said. \"I decided I'd try everything I could to pull her. I started cracking open the champagne, fell into a bottle and stayed there. I was absolutely smashed. I woke up the next morning with my first hangover since 1994.\" </p> <p>And, being a dominant factor in our social culture, alcohol is increasingly becoming a major issue in our political culture. When the leader of the opposition wants to look like a man of the people, he recalls his days drinking 14 pints as a teenager and the 32 rum and blacks he claims he downed on his 18th birthday. </p> <p>When the prime minister is looking for the central theme of what will almost certainly be the final parliamentary session, he reaches for the bottle and declares war on \"yob culture\". When his son, Euan, was found inebriated in Leicester Square it was not just a blow to him as a father but a political embarrassment to the head of a government that had just proposed spot fines for those found drunk in public. </p> <p>Back in Stevenage a young woman, in a short skirt despite the bitter cold, stands outside the Pulse nightclub with her head in a bin. While one friend puts a coat over her back so that no one can see her knickers, the other holds her hair out of her face as she retches. A sight so common that no one is watching. </p> <p>Inside the Vogue nightclub next door, Peter and Dave have been drinking since lunchtime. Peter, 35, has custody of his two children every other weekend. On his weekends off he \"goes out and gets smashed\". Dave runs out of fingers and moves on to his toes as he counts how many drinks he has had that day and then laughs a cheery, leery, glazed laugh, while expressing amazement that they're still standing. </p> <p>By the time the night is over the car park will be spattered with vomit. A young man staggers dangerously and aimlessly down a main road shouting: \"I'm a he man.\" Another, perched precariously against a burger van, yells: \"You're a cunt.\" </p> <p>Britain has a drink problem. We drink almost two-thirds more alcohol per person today than we did in 1965. More than 9m adults drink at levels that endanger their long-term health, and more than one in 25 of us is alcohol-dependent. While it is an issue affecting the whole country, some places and people are in more trouble than others. The proportion of women drinking over the limit rose by 55% between 1984 to 1996. Glasgow is facing the worst incidence of alcohol abuse for 80 years. Most vulnerable are the young - a third of young men live on \"beer and fast food\"; a quarter of 16- to 19-year-olds in greater Glasgow get drunk at least once a week. </p> <p>It has cast a serious pall over the way other countries see us. According to a British Council report recently, those aged between 24 and 40 around the world regard Britons as \"violent, xenophobic and frequently drunk\". </p> <p>And it is costing us dearly. Not just in human terms - 28,000 deaths a year are alcohol-related - but economically. Every year alcohol costs the NHS around \u00a3150m, industry an estimated \u00a32bn and the government roughly \u00a3150m, according to Alcohol Concern. </p> <p>But, curiously, it is not the amount we drink that marks us out as a nation. Even though we drink considerably more than we used to, we still drink a lot less than most other European Union countries. That is particularly true of France and Germany, where Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der recently made it to number two in the music charts when a DJ put music to a recording of him saying: \"Get me a bottle of beer or I'm going to go on strike here.\" With the exception of Finland and Sweden - where, like here, they binge drink - no other EU country drinks less than Britain. </p> <p>This is borne out in other areas. Britons are far less likely to die from cirrhosis of the liver than citizens of any other EU country with the exception of the Irish and the Dutch. The incidence of road traffic accidents involving alcohol is also substantially lower than the EU average. </p> <p>Our drinking habits have also changed quite radically. Europe has traditionally been split up into drinking cultures determined principally by climate. Colder, northern countries (the UK, Germany, Austria) are beer-drinking cultures, while warmer, southern nations (Italy, France, Spain) drink wine. Now those habits are converging. The proportion of beer in our national alcohol intake has dropped by a quarter, while wine has more than doubled. </p> <p>So if we drink less than most other European countries and are increasingly drinking the same kind of things, why does a Saturday night out in Lisbon, Barcelona or Lyon never have quite the same chaotic, threatening feel as London, Birmingham or Liverpool? </p> <p> The problem, say experts, is the way that we drink. \"In most other countries they drink with food or as part of some other social activity,\" says Mr Appleby. \"Here we mainly drink to drink and quite often to get drunk. The particular thing about British drinking culture is that it is associated with aggression.\" </p> <p>\"The problems in Europe relating to alcohol are largely medical whereas in Britain they are about disorder,\" says professor Nick Heather, who is the director of the centre of alcohol and drug studies in Newcastle. \"They may drink more on the continent but they drink consistently and regularly whereas we drink in short bursts.\" </p> <p>The reason for this cannot be found in the British psyche but in the history of our licensing laws and cultural make-up, argues Dr Paul Davis, a consultant clinical psychologist who specialises in addictive behaviour. \"Until the very end of the 20th century, the law squashed the hours when we could drink into a relatively small space of time so we learned to drink quickly and in quite a focused way,\" says Dr Davis, who believes bingeing has been a key element in British drinking culture since before the Victorian era. </p> <p>\"And because we drink as a separate activity, away not just from food but from children, our drinking habits are not regulated by other social norms, which makes deviant behaviour far more likely.\" The situation in Scotland, which has enjoyed more relaxed laws for far longer but has more acute problems than the rest of the UK, is underpinned by different historical and cultural factors, he says. </p> <p>Whatever the reasons, the consequences are there for all to see every weekend on almost every high street in Britain. As such, it marks an ideal point for Blairite intervention - a place where individual rights meet societal responsibilities without the encumbrance of ideology. A populist issue where the boundaries between private and public are necessarily blurred. A problem that appears to demand New Labour's increasingly familiar strain of social authoritarianism in the name of common sense and decency. </p> <p>By maintaining the distinction between the nation's most popular drug and other drugs, from cannabis to heroin and crack, the government has left alcohol out of the broader picture. It does not feature in the high-profile, cross-cabinet assault on drugs; there is no alcohol tsar. By concentrating on \"yob culture\", says Prof Heather, \"They are responding to a real and growing problem in this country. But the sheer quantity and severity of problems created by alcohol abuse are many times greater than all those caused by illicit drugs put together.\" </p> <p>And even though alcohol abuse has a serious effect in every area that the government has made a priority, from homelessness to health, from crime to education (one in four school exclusions is related to alcohol) there has been no coordinated approach to the issue. The response has emanated from Downing Street and the Home Office and has been framed strictly in terms of crime and punishment. </p> <p>Launching its action plan to tackle alcohol-related crime in August, the Home Office called for greater use of existing laws to confiscate alcohol from young people and to prevent the sale of alcohol to them as well as new powers for the police to close premises associated with violent and disorderly behaviour. </p> <p>The approach is useful as far as it goes, say alcohol experts. The problem is that it doesn't nearly go far enough. \"It's a start,\" says Mr Appleby. \"But we need a national alcohol strategy that deals with issues across the board rather than just the behavioural end of it.

      "bodyText": "From the Tannoy of Finsbury Park station comes a familiar message. The 8.33pm to Hertford North has been cancelled. The three middle-aged men, accompanied by one young boy, have an hour to kill and there is only one thing for it. \"Let's go to the pub,\" says one. \"These bloody trains will drive you to drink.\" They will also drive you with drink. The majority of those who board the next train are carrying bottles of beer. About a quarter of the carriage is drunk. When we arrive at Stevenage the walkway between the town centre and the leisure park, a thoroughfare between town and clubland, teenage boys clutch pints of lager as though they were tickets to manhood. It's Saturday night and you can almost hear the drum beats of a primal British ritual pounding. It's time for the smallest market town and the largest urban centre to bury their differences in a sea of beer and Bacardi Breezers. By the end of the night, young women with glazed eyes will link arms and sing anything from Frank Sinatra to The Wizard of Oz; young men will support themselves against the nearest immovable object and then urinate on it. It's Saturday night: time to \"get hammered\", \"blasted\" and \"go mad for it\". It's time, in short, for alcohol to take over. \"British social culture is built around drink,\" says Eric Appleby of Alcohol Concern. \"If you're going to meet people after work you meet them in a pub. If you're going out for a chat you'll go to a pub and in the pub there is a macho thing about how many drinks you've had. Drinking alcohol then becomes the primary social activity.\" So while the social scenes of most American sitcoms, such as Seinfeld, Friends or Frasier, take place in coffee bars and diners, all English soap characters like to mull over their problems at the Woolpack, the Rovers Return or the Queen Vic. If Jim Davidson, the comedian and Tory MC, wants to impress his colleague and co-star, the TV presenter Suzi Perry, he falls off the wagon and drinks himself silly. \"As soon as I saw her I fell in love with her,\" he said. \"I decided I'd try everything I could to pull her. I started cracking open the champagne, fell into a bottle and stayed there. I was absolutely smashed. I woke up the next morning with my first hangover since 1994.\" And, being a dominant factor in our social culture, alcohol is increasingly becoming a major issue in our political culture. When the leader of the opposition wants to look like a man of the people, he recalls his days drinking 14 pints as a teenager and the 32 rum and blacks he claims he downed on his 18th birthday. When the prime minister is looking for the central theme of what will almost certainly be the final parliamentary session, he reaches for the bottle and declares war on \"yob culture\". When his son, Euan, was found inebriated in Leicester Square it was not just a blow to him as a father but a political embarrassment to the head of a government that had just proposed spot fines for those found drunk in public. Back in Stevenage a young woman, in a short skirt despite the bitter cold, stands outside the Pulse nightclub with her head in a bin. While one friend puts a coat over her back so that no one can see her knickers, the other holds her hair out of her face as she retches. A sight so common that no one is watching. Inside the Vogue nightclub next door, Peter and Dave have been drinking since lunchtime. Peter, 35, has custody of his two children every other weekend. On his weekends off he \"goes out and gets smashed\". Dave runs out of fingers and moves on to his toes as he counts how many drinks he has had that day and then laughs a cheery, leery, glazed laugh, while expressing amazement that they're still standing. By the time the night is over the car park will be spattered with vomit. A young man staggers dangerously and aimlessly down a main road shouting: \"I'm a he man.\" Another, perched precariously against a burger van, yells: \"You're a cunt.\" Britain has a drink problem. We drink almost two-thirds more alcohol per person today than we did in 1965. More than 9m adults drink at levels that endanger their long-term health, and more than one in 25 of us is alcohol-dependent. While it is an issue affecting the whole country, some places and people are in more trouble than others. The proportion of women drinking over the limit rose by 55% between 1984 to 1996. Glasgow is facing the worst incidence of alcohol abuse for 80 years. Most vulnerable are the young - a third of young men live on \"beer and fast food\"; a quarter of 16- to 19-year-olds in greater Glasgow get drunk at least once a week. It has cast a serious pall over the way other countries see us. According to a British Council report recently, those aged between 24 and 40 around the world regard Britons as \"violent, xenophobic and frequently drunk\". And it is costing us dearly. Not just in human terms - 28,000 deaths a year are alcohol-related - but economically. Every year alcohol costs the NHS around \u00a3150m, industry an estimated \u00a32bn and the government roughly \u00a3150m, according to Alcohol Concern. But, curiously, it is not the amount we drink that marks us out as a nation. Even though we drink considerably more than we used to, we still drink a lot less than most other European Union countries. That is particularly true of France and Germany, where Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der recently made it to number two in the music charts when a DJ put music to a recording of him saying: \"Get me a bottle of beer or I'm going to go on strike here.\" With the exception of Finland and Sweden - where, like here, they binge drink - no other EU country drinks less than Britain. This is borne out in other areas. Britons are far less likely to die from cirrhosis of the liver than citizens of any other EU country with the exception of the Irish and the Dutch. The incidence of road traffic accidents involving alcohol is also substantially lower than the EU average. Our drinking habits have also changed quite radically.

      "bodyText": "Every town in Britain would be allowed to create its own \"green belt\" to protect farmland and open spaces from development, under proposals unveiled by Tory leader William Hague today. In a radical initiative to halt excessive development in the countryside, Mr Hague promised to scrap national housebuilding guidelines and let each local council decide for itself on its requirements for new homes. The move came a day after planning minister Nick Raynsford announced that the government was cutting back the housebuilding target for south-east England from 43,000 to 39,000 homes. The cut followed Tory accusations that Labour was \"concreting over the countryside\", but the new target remains well above the 33,000 homes a year - a number the regional planning body Serplan believes the region can cope with. Visiting threatened green belt in Hemel Hempstead, Herts, today, Mr Hague said: \"Instead of protecting our countryside, John Prescott is issuing Soviet-style diktats to local councils, forcing them to ensure the construction of millions of buildings over the next 20 years. \"In an act of supreme environmental vandalism, Whitehall bureaucrats, with their central planning targets, intend to cover England's green fields with unwanted housing estates and executive homes.\" Under the Tories, communities would be given the right to appeal against unpopular large-scale developments in their area, ending the current anomaly under which only developers have the right to appeal if proposals are turned down, said Mr Hague. Councils would also be given powers to enforce the use of local architectural styles and materials in new developments, to prevent the creation of 'identikit' estates all over the country, he added. However, the Chartered Institute of Housing has criticised Mr Hague's call for housebuilding targets to be abolished. A spokesperson said: \"There must be some way of assessing housing needs, monitoring building levels, and reviewing these in the context of demand and supply. \"Without building targets, we risk insufficient housing to meet demand and this would have implications in high demand areas for both prospective owner-occupiers through increased house prices and the opportunity to obtain rented homes for those unable to afford house purchase. \"There are, however, some real questions about how housing needs can be assessed reliably. These problems need to be tackled, rather than rejecting the whole idea of trying to plan at a more strategic level at all. The importance of targets for affordable housing also needs to be recognised.\"",

Then they voted against new parliamentary elections - which, in effect, froze him out again.</p> <p>Netanyahu had declared before the vote that he would not run for office unless the knesset simultaneously sought a fresh public mandate.</p> <p>That was not at all to the taste of the knesset members (MKs), who were elected last year at the same time as Barak, for a four-year term.

      "bodyText": "An audacious comeback bid by former prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu has been foiled by Israeli parliamentarians. After the knesset voted against holding general elections, Netanyahu announced that he was withdrawing from the separate prime ministerial poll, due on February 6. The way is now open for a two-horse race between Netanyahu's successor as prime minister, Ehud Barak, and his successor as leader of the rightwing Likud faction, Ariel Sharon. The early-morning manoeuvrings of the knesset were extraordinary, even by Israel's rancorous parliamentary standards. Members first voted to allow non-knesset members to stand for prime minister - which would allow Netanyahu in. Then they voted against new parliamentary elections - which, in effect, froze him out again. Netanyahu had declared before the vote that he would not run for office unless the knesset simultaneously sought a fresh public mandate. That was not at all to the taste of the knesset members (MKs), who were elected last year at the same time as Barak, for a four-year term. Many know that in the current turbulent climate, the voters would consign them to political oblivion. Under Israel's peculiar electoral system, MKs are chosen from national party lists, with voters allowed to indicate their preferences among the slates of candidates. That, along with the separate prime ministerial election, encourages a cult of personality in which charisma (or the lack of it) counts a great deal more than subtlety, wit, or even ideology. It also practically ensures a knesset of perpetually squabbling factions, in which no prime minister can ever be sure of a viable majority. Netanyahu, universally known as Bibi, is the living embodiment of the system. He clawed his way to the top of the notoriously fractious Likud movement with a combination of dazzling PR skills and ruthless behind-the-scenes power-plays. In 1996 he snatched the prime ministerial election from Shimon Peres - the successor to the assassinated Yitzhak Rabin - with a campaign dominated by security fears. But after three years of Bibi's bluster and procrastination with the peace process that Rabin had begun, the voters again opted for renewed dialogue with the Palestinians. The man they chose, Barak, had exactly the blend of qualities Israelis crave in their leaders: a bluff former army chief, he promised peace with security; a settlement without too many concessions. That proved a chimera. Barak moved as far as he dared to offer the Palestinians what they in turn craved: a state of their own. He even offered Yasser Arafat a limited role in Jerusalem. The offer infuriated the Israeli right - and the limits on it also enraged Arafat. The result was the renewed intifada, sparked at the end of September when the Likud leader, Sharon, made an appallingly ill-judged visit to the Muslim sacred site in Jerusalem. Since then more than 330 lives have been lost, the overwhelmingly majority of them Palestinian. The fragile economy of the Palestinian territories is wrecked, Israelis are living in constant fear of retaliatory attacks, and the peace process is little more than a memory. Even now, however, frantic diplomatic efforts are under way to revive some kind of dialogue, with Bill Clinton hoping to use the dying moments of his US presidency to somehow rescue the peace process. But amid the rising clamour of the Israeli prime ministerial election, it will be hard for any candidate to stray beyond ritual pledges to deal firmly with the unrest. Barak's chances of retaining power have been increased markedly by the sidelining of Netanyahu. Since he went into self-imposed exile after his defeat, the former prime minister has enjoyed a remarkable return to public esteem.

      "bodyText": "The former Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, declared today that he would not run for his old post in the February elections if the current deadlocked parliament remains in place. His announcement comes despite his commanding lead in opinion polls and his ardent supporters urging his return to political life. The declaration all but eliminates Mr Netanyahu as a candidate from the February 6 election and greatly enhances the prospects for the re-election of the current prime minister, Ehud Barak, who has seen his political fortunes wane due to the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian violence. Provided Mr Netanyahu stays on the sidelines - and he could still change his mind - the election will be a battle between two ex-generals: Mr Barak, who's pushing hard for a peace deal with the Palestinians, and Ariel Sharon. Mr Sharon, leader of the Likud party, is a veteran right-wing politician who says Israel needs tougher security measures and should make fewer concessions in peace negotiations. While Mr Netanyahu is far ahead in the polls, Mr Barak and Mr Sharon have been running roughly even against each other. Until the early hours of today, Mr Netanyahu was ineligible to run for prime minister in the special election because he was not a sitting member of parliament, as required by law. The Israeli parliament, knesset, changed the law in a late-night session to allow any citizen to run. The measure was called the \"Bibi bill\", in reference to Mr Netanyahu's nickname. But moments later, the legislature voted not to disband itself - something that Mr Netanyahu had insisted on as a prerequisite for his running. Mr Netanyahu, said in a statement today: \"Because the knesset didn't have the courage to answer the will of the public and put itself up for new elections, I decided to fulfil my promise. \"I will consider running once the knesset disperses itself.\" Mr Barak, meanwhile, told reporters he was pleased that parliament would not disband, thereby saving Israel from what he called \"unnecessary elections.\" There's little likelihood that parliament will change its mind in coming days. However, in the complicated machinations of Israeli politics, the potential candidates still had some room for manoeuvre. As Mr Netanyahu's supporters were calling on him to reconsider, another former prime minister, Shimon Peres, was meeting with lawmakers in efforts to make a decision about running himself. Mr Peres, 77, is the most liberal of the potential candidates, and recent polls suggest that he could beat Mr Barak in a first round of voting and go on to face Mr Sharon in a second round. The surveys show Mr Sharon leads Mr Peres slightly. Meanwhile, negotiators from Israel and Palestine were expected in Washington today for meetings with US peace mediators. There was speculation in the Israeli media about the possibility of a summit with Mr Barak, the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat and the US president, Bill Clinton. However, the Palestinian information minister, Yasser Abed Rabbo said such a summit could be held only to sign an agreement, not to negotiate, and he doubted that there was enough time to finish a pact. Mr Sharon declared that since Mr Barak announced his resignation on December 10, he has no right to negotiate an accord. and added that if he became prime minister he would not honour any agreement Mr Barak signs now. Mr Sharon is reviled by Palestinians and is a polarising figure among Israelis. The current round of violence erupted after his controversial September 28 visit to Jerusalem's Al Aqsa Mosque compound. Likud leaders have harshly criticised Mr Barak's compromise offers to the Palestinians. Most of Mr Barak's coalition partners walked out over the concessions last July, though no peace agreement was reached. Mr Barak has lost more support because of the violence, which has taken more than 330 lives, most of them Palestinians.

In it, theology student Jean-Claude Brialy (another iconic actor of the period) returns to his native village to find that his talented childhood friend, Blain, has become a hopeless drunk and is estranged from his pregnant wife (Lafont). Blain, in his first leading role, brilliantly expressed the pain of the disappointed character.</p> <p>Chabrol cast the same two male leads in his second feature, Les Cousins (1959), a riveting and perverse study of decadent Parisian student life. Blain was perfect as the simple, good-hearted country cousin who comes to study at the Sorbonne, while staying at the luxury apartment of his cynical cousin (Brialy).</p> <p>Blain, who was abandoned as a child by his stable-lad father, was born in Paris. He had been an extra in a few films before director Julien Duvivier discovered the 25-year-old standing at the bar of a cafe in the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, and gave him a role in Voici Les Temps Des Assassins (1955), starring the great Jean Gabin.</p> <p>After the two Chabrol features, Blain starred in a number of Italian films, de rigueur for many actors of the 1960s, notably Carlo Lizzani's The Hunchback Of Rome (1960). He also appeared in the gossip columns because of his stormy marriage and divorce from Bernadette Lafont.</p> <p>When making Les Mistons, Truffaut noted: \"G\u00e9rard is, I think, very unhappy. He bellyaches because I prefer Bernadette in high heels; he has a Toulouse-Lautrec complex. And then he's come to realise that Bernadette is completely at home in front of the camera, and he makes a scene every day.\"</p> <p>Actually, Blain never felt completely at ease as an actor, and hankered to direct, although he had to wait some years before he could do so. In the meanwhile, he was part of the international cast of Howard Hawks's Hatari! (1962), about a group of African hunters, led by John Wayne, who catch animals for zoos. Blain was one of a number of leading French actors in the boulevard comedy La Bonne Soupe (1963), and played a resistance fighter who refuses to execute a traitor in Costa-Gavras's Shock Troops (1968).</p> <p>Blain, whose idols were the ascetic Carl Dreyer and Robert Bresson, directed the first of eight films, Les Amis, in 1970. Labelled Bressonian, his pictures were uncompromising studies of domestic crises, often seen from the child's point of view, which led critics to suspect they were autobiographical. Generally, critics were favourable to him, but the films seldom made money and had distribution problems.</p> <p>The fact that Blain was a difficult man to work with, and refused to compromise his principles, did not help matters. There was also his ambiguous friendship with members of the National Front, which cast a shadow over Pierre et Djemila (1987), a film which seemed anti-Arab, although the screenplay was written by Mohamed Bouchibi, formerly of the FLN.</p> <p>Blain, who remarried and had two sons, found his last years particularly difficult.

      "bodyText": "Express owner Richard Desmond has axed newspaper and magazine subscriptions for all journalists in his latest cost-cutting exercise. From today, all journalists including editor Rosie Boycott and other senior editorial staff, will have to pay for all their own newspapers and magazines. Richard Desmond believes he can save up to \u00a330,000 by forcing journalists to pay for their own newspapers and magazines. The move has enraged staff who say it is yet another sign that Mr Desmond does not understand how newspapers work. And they fear it could lead to more cost-cutting. The company has categorically denied that it plans to axe up to 100 journalists in the new year. However, rumours of a fierce blood-letting persist and some believe up to 200 jobs could ultimately go. The papers currently employ 450 editorial staff. \"Comparisons are being made with the Daily Mirror, not the Mail. The figure Desmond has mentioned is 170. He says 'how come the Mirror operates on this level and we can't?',\" said one source. But Ms Boycott is believed to have repeatedly asked Mr Desmond for a figure for planned redundancies and has not been given one by him or other Northern &amp; Shell executives. Ms Boycott was horrified by the way Mr Desmond handled recent redundancies in the sales, marketing and IT departments, accusing him of \"heavy-handed\" management. She is opposed to any editorial redundancies, believing that the paper is already under-resourced. Meanwhile, insiders have staunchly denied reports circulating among Express journalists that Ms Boycott plans to resign at a high-profile charity event tomorrow. \"Rosie simply wouldn't do something like that.She would not hijack a charity event,\" said one insider. A spokesman for the Express said Ms Boycott was in discussions with Mr Desmond about adding a new financial section to the Sunday Express, as well as planning to \"upgrade\" the Sunday Express magazine.",

Nor will Wolverhampton; nor Brighton and Hove - though those two may chafe against each other even more than usual, now that they have been formally conjoined. All three (or is it four?) will be celebrating this morning, since they have just been \"officially\" declared cities. The complaints will be left to those denied: Luton, Newport and Wrexham among the 36 places that will have to soldier on as mere towns. What is more, the rejection of all six Welsh aspirants and both of Northern Ireland's has aggravated national sensibilities as well as local ones. </p> <p>But there is a greater cause for ambivalence about yesterday's news than the disappointment of those left out. Archie Norman, for the Tories, got close to it when he objected to the whole process which arrived at yesterday's decision. He suspected political calculation, noting that all three of the winners include constituencies narrowly held by Labour. With an election near, a dose of civic PR certainly will not hurt. (Still, if that was the criterion, Luton, reeling from Vauxhall, would surely have won.) </p> <p>What Mr Norman complained about was the process by which city status is granted by personal command of the Queen, on ministerial advice. In other words, our old friend crown prerogative.

Nor will Wolverhampton; nor Brighton and Hove - though those two may chafe against each other even more than usual, now that they have been formally conjoined. All three (or is it four?) will be celebrating this morning, since they have just been \"officially\" declared cities. The complaints will be left to those denied: Luton, Newport and Wrexham among the 36 places that will have to soldier on as mere towns. What is more, the rejection of all six Welsh aspirants and both of Northern Ireland's has aggravated national sensibilities as well as local ones. But there is a greater cause for ambivalence about yesterday's news than the disappointment of those left out. Archie Norman, for the Tories, got close to it when he objected to the whole process which arrived at yesterday's decision. He suspected political calculation, noting that all three of the winners include constituencies narrowly held by Labour. With an election near, a dose of civic PR certainly will not hurt. (Still, if that was the criterion, Luton, reeling from Vauxhall, would surely have won.) What Mr Norman complained about was the process by which city status is granted by personal command of the Queen, on ministerial advice. In other words, our old friend crown prerogative. That is why parliament had no role in yesterday's choice and why the candidate cities could do no more than wait to hear the whim of Her Majesty's ministers. The same point was neatly highlighted by yesterday's claim that Tony Blair had pencilled March 29 2001 as the date of the general election. Such stories will proliferate between now and the spring.

Six of last year's top earning films in France were American, two were British and only two were French. The financial stakes are high: France is forecast to be the European country with the largest number of sales of DVD players and DVDs next year. There is also growing evidence that DVD sales are outstripping VHS video sales in France by a margin of about six to one.

I have not even really thought about all I have heard and seen - that will come later. For now the present facts are all I can manage. </p> <p>We start early for Ramallah and a couple of minutes from my hotel I see two Israeli flags fixed to the flat roof of a house. Next to them four boys in civilian clothes nurse machine guns. My driver, Abu Karim, says these are four houses that have recently been taken from their Arab residents. </p> <p>Out of Jerusalem, major roads are being built to connect up with the settlements. The roadworks are guarded by Israeli Army trucks. </p> <p>The road north to Ramallah - the road that the Palestinians may use - will lead us through the town of Bira and the news is that Bira was shelled last night. Soon we see the concrete blocks, the waiting cars, the soldiers and we swerve off to the right and drive through dirt roads. Abu Karim points to a rectangular crater in the middle of the road the size of a grave. The army, he says, do this just to make life more difficult. A bone-jolting 20 minutes later we rejoin the main road about one kilometre up from where we had left it. </p> <p>An hour and a half later (and a distance equivalent to, say, Chelsea to Kingston) we are sitting in Rita Haniyya's living-room listening to her and her friend Layla Qasim. The women, one Christian, the other Muslim, are founders of the National Union of Palestinian Women (NUPW) and worked hard to establish the Centre for the Support of the Family in Ramallah, a day-centre where children were taught music and encouraged to draw: \"The children are not allowed to see maps of Palestine or learn their own history,\" they tell me. Eighteen months ago the Israelis closed the centre down for \"inspiring sedition\". </p> <p>\"Sedition!\" snorts Layla Qasim. \"We were trying to help the mothers give their children a 'normal' childhood. You know what the children sing? They sing: 'Papa bought me a trifle/A machine-gun and a rifle'. </p> <p>\"We were struggling to get them to sing normal children's songs. But normal children's songs have nothing to do with the reality of their lives. </p> <p>\"When the children said 'The Jews came and took my cousin/Mixed our rice with the flour and the sugar', we would say don't say the Jews, it's the Israelis, the Zionists. We were battling with the ethics of language.\" </p> <p>\"The media in Britain,\" I say, \"ask why mothers allow their children to go out and throw stones at the army.\" </p> <p>\"Allow?\" says Rita Haniyya, \"You should see the quantities of Valium we've dispensed to women in the camps simply to help them cope with their lives: when their children go out to play they're playing under the guns of the army observation post above them - these people have been living under 'temporary emergency' conditions for 33 years, and some since 1948. They don't go looking for the army, the army is right on their doorstep.\" </p> <p>\"There isn't a child,\" says Layla, \"who doesn't have a father or a brother banished or jailed or killed. When the soldiers come in and beat up a father - the kids see it - all they've got is one room. They see their father being beaten. What do you think it does to them? They ask us if people in the whole world live like this. What can we tell them? A three year old comes in and tells me: 'The Jews came and beat my father and his tummy fell out onto the floor but we got him to hospital and they're going to mend him.'\" </p> <p>The names come thick and fast, Jihad Badr who was bringing up his kid sisters and brothers after their mother died of cancer, who survived an operation for a brain tumour but was killed in the al-Aqsa demonstrations; Hania, 13, who was shot in the leg, bundled into an army car and hit repeatedly on the same leg: \"I didn't scream,\" they tell me she said, \"not because I was feeling brave, just because I was afraid they'd kill me.\" The Hammouri twins, 19, shot on the same day. And on and on. </p> <p>The NUPW now trains women in first aid and civil defence, it organises vaccinations, it gives counselling and advises on home economics (this includes boycotting Israeli and American products). It is funded entirely by donations from its more well-off members - many of them abroad. There are 2m Palestinians in Israel and the occupied territories, 5m in the diaspora. </p> <p>\"We've compromised,\" Rita Haniyya says, \"they have West Jerusalem, the Carmel, Yafa and Haifa and so on. They have Israel. But they want everything, it's their nature. They attack us - physically - in three ways: through the army, the settlers, and the Mustaribs (agents who pretend to be Arab).\" </p> <p>The Mustaribs, she says, mingle with the people during demonstrations: \"They choose a child, grab him, throw their keffiyehs over their faces (so they can mingle again without being identified) whip out their yarmulkes and a gun and rush with the child over to an army car.\" </p> <p>\"You know the worst of it is,\" they say, \"that they keep you guessing. You never know if a road is to be open or closed. When they're going to shut off your water or turn off your electricity. Whether they're going to permit a burial. Whether they're going to give you a permit to travel. You can never ever plan. They create conditions to keep you spinning.\" </p> <p>At Oslo, Israel agreed to hand over some major Arab towns to the Palestinian Authority. Israel, however, retained all the areas surrounding the towns, so that to get from one to another the Palestinians had to carry permits which were checked at Israeli checkpoints. With the intifada the Israeli army simply encircled the towns, preventing the residents from leaving or entering. Critics of Oslo at the time said this was a blueprint for disaster. No one understands why the Palestinian Authority agreed to it. Some say they simply didn't have maps. It is at the soldiers encircling their towns that the youths and children of the intifada throw stones. </p> <p>There are some good Israelis, Rita says, people of conscience. \"Look at what Amira Hass writes in Ha'aretz. And Uri Avnery. But they're marginalised.\" </p> <p>Are you in touch with them? </p> <p>\"Not any more. We realised they would go so far and no further. The best of them balks at the right of return for the refugees. Even Leah Rabin wanted East Jerusalem. At the beginning of the intifadah when they got in touch we said you've been talking to us for years, now it's time for you to talk to your government.\" </p> <p>Back in Jerusalem I break my fast at a small cafe outside al-Zahra Gate. On the street outside is the army car and the soldiers. At the table behind me three elderly men are extolling the days of Gamal Abdul Naser and the idea of pan-Arabism. They end up singing popular Egyptian songs of the 60s: \"Ya Gamal/Beloved of millions\" and \"We said we'd build and now we've built/the Hi-i-gh Dam\". </p> <p>The owner, recognising my Egyptian dialect, gives me a tamarind juice and pudding on the house. He asks if I'm OK at my hotel. His family would have been glad to take me in but they're in al-Khalil (Hebron). He used to commute, it's only half an hour, but now with the closures he can only manage to sneak in to see them once a week. </p> <p>A silent candle-lit demonstration outside the New Gate of the old city. Sixty candles flickered in the hands of 60 Palestinian women just outside the Gate. Opposite them, on the other side of the road 15 Israeli women dressed in black held 15 candles. </p> <p><b> Friday</b><br> </p> <p> This is the first Friday of Ramadan and Barak, in a move designed to \"achieve quiet during the month of Ramadan\", has repealed the ban on men under 45 praying at the al-Aqsa mosque. </p> <p>Israeli mounted police, armed and dressed in riot gear, guard the gates of the old city as though we were armed and dangerous football hooligans. We pass through al-Zahra Gate in single file between two rows of soldiers with machine guns. Each man has to stop and show his identity papers. The women, if they keep their heads bowed and their eyes on the ground, are left alone. At Bab Hutta, the actual gate to al-Haram al-Sharif, there are more soldiers with guns. Inside, the men head for al-Aqsa, the women for that choice jewel, the Dome of the Rock. Because the Israeli amnesty does not extend to the people of the West Bank, there are maybe 20,000-25,000 people here today instead of the 500,000 you would normally expect. </p> <p>At the Dome I squeeze in through Bab al-Janna (the Gate of Paradise). In straight lines, shoulder-to-shoulder, we pray then sit to listen to the sermon. The Imam preaches patience, steadfastness and opposition. He reminds us of the Prophet's saying that there are those who fast and gain nothing except hunger; to fast is to renounce falsehood, hypocrisy and all bad deeds. He lists the crimes of the Israeli military occupation against the people. </p> <p>He lists the demands of the people: an end to the occupation, the implementation of UN resolution 242 and the return to the borders of June 4 1967, an independent and sovereign Palestinian state in the West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem, the release of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails, the right of return to the homeland of all Palestinian refugees. He repeats God's promise that the righteous shall prevail, then he prays for al-Aqsa itself. Again and again he implores God to protect it from the plots being woven against it, again and again the women's voices from the Dome and the men's voices from al-Aqsa rise: Amen. </p> <p>The al-Aqsa, where the men pray, is close to Bab el-Magharba (the Gate of the Moroccans) which is close to the Wailing Wall. As prayers end, groups of young men and boys start gathering there. But there the army and police are solidly waiting and everyone knows that if one stone hits that wall someone will be shot. But the shabab [youth] are in the grip of fervour and a man who some say is a \"Fatah element\" starts yelling Hamas slogans and, playing Pied Piper, leads them away from the certain danger of Bab el-Magharba and through the terraces of al-Haram to the relative safety of Bab el-Sabbat. There they stop. </p> <p>Outside the gateway is a police station that they had set fire to a while back. The administrators of the mosque rush to place wooden barriers between the shabab and the small army of soldiers and police taking up positions outside with guns aimed. The shabab chant of the Prophet's victory against the Jews at Khaybar in the 7th century, some of them rush back into the Haram and try to break down the iron door leading to the stairs of the minaret. It will not break. One young man climbs a wall and tries to open a higher door into the minaret. </p> <p>On the walls of the terraces hundreds of women and older men stand and watch. The atmosphere is almost one of carnival. Maybe a thousand shabab are facing the soldiers, but the gate is narrow so it's not too hard for the elders to hold them back. On the steps just opposite the gate, the steps leading up to the top of the city wall, the photographers stand with their cameras, helmets and bullet-proof vests. Something happens outside and the shabab scatter for a moment then regroup. A woman in an embroidered bedouin dress pushes forward into their midst, yelling along with them and a man tries to hold her back: \"They might shoot you!\" </p> <p>\"Let them shoot me. Am I worth more than any of these youngsters?\" </p> <p>A woman in horn-rimmed spectacles waves her arms at the soldiers from the wall where she's standing: \"Get out!\" she shouts, \"Get out! You've strangled us, may God strangle you.\" </p> <p>One young man is ordering his little brother to go home. \"Let me stay,\" the kid begs. \"Just for a few minutes. Let me stay.\" It takes a cuff on the side of the head to send him home. A couple of smallish stones are pitched across the wall. \"Bet that landed on our car,\" a very well-dressed, slim young man says to his companion. </p> <p>A well-built youth picks up a large rock and throws it to the ground to smash it. It doesn't smash and he picks it up again. As he raises it a mosque caretaker runs up and takes it from him, quietly, without a word. He places it carefully under a tree and the young man walks away. An argument is breaking out on the side: \"They shouldn't make trouble,\" a tall, fair man shouts. \"The Israelis will close it down. Let people pray.\" </p> <p>A bystander laughs: \"You've been praying for 50 years. What good has it done you?\" </p> <p>A dimunitive sheikh in a very trim costume and brand-new red cleric's hat is marching measuredly up and down beside the yelling demonstrators with a megaphone: \"Your presence here incites them. Disperse. Disperse.\" </p> <p>No one pays any attention to him except one man who says to his neighbour: \"He does this every Friday.\" </p> <p>There are women and girls sitting chatting under the trees. Eventually the shabab start to drift away. It has taken two hours but this time, here, the Palestinians have no martyrs. </p> <p><b> Saturday Noon, Ramallah</b><br> </p> <p> The great hall of Our Lady of the Gospels independent school in Ramallah is filling up with students. Hundreds of girls and boys crowd into the seats talking and laughing. On the stage the principal, Mrs Samira, and the guest speaker, Dr Mustafa Barghouti are setting up the overhead projector. Dr Barghouti is one of the triumvirate heading the People's Party of Palestine, and - more importantly - he has been organising all the medical aid work for the intifada. </p> <p>This talk is part of the independent schools of Ramallah's joint initiative to \"document the truth and demand our legitimate rights before the world\". This group of kids is in economic band A, their parents can afford to educate them privately, can stop them going to the barricades. Their hair is glossy, their teeth are good. As Mrs Samira lists the names of the participating schools they cheer and stamp and she outlaws whistling. </p> <p>They all want to know how they can contribute. They ask why the Authority has not declared Oslo dead? Why it arrests members of Hamas? What is the Authority doing to protect civilians from the attacks of the settlers? Why does the Authority continue to try to coordinate security with the Israelis? They want a programme to support the thousands of workers who've lost their jobs inside Israel. They want the leadership to pull together and an end to the factions. They want to talk to the world. They want independence and they want to know what they can do. </p> <p>Dr Barghouti tells them they can join the NGO across the road. They can be trained in first aid and primary care, in crisis management. They can do media work, monitor the net, respond to articles ... They crowd around to put their names down before they rush off to be picked up by parents at 2.30pm sharp. </p> <p><b> 3pm, Ramallah</b><br> </p> <p> Another Barghouti (it's a massive family), Marwan Barghouti, is mostly on the move. He is 41, the chief executive officer of Fatah. Since the intifada he's been on the streets with the shabab and he has formed the People's Watch, groups in each village that try to defend the villagers against the settlers. Everybody says he is targeted by the Israelis (Ma'ariv called him one of the \"triangle of terror: Arafat, Barghouti and Raggoub, head of Palestinian intelligence\"). Some say he's targeted by the Palestinian Authority - for being too popular. </p> <p>In his office, against a huge poster of al-Aqsa, he repeats that the intifada and negotiations do not preclude each other; that the intifada is the only way the people have of projecting their own voice, their own will into the negotiations. He points at a poster of Muhammad al-Durra and says: \"We need to get away from the image of the Palestinian as a victim. This is a better poster,\" pointing at a poster of a child confronting a tank. </p> <p>I say: \"That kid was killed two days later.\" </p> <p>He says: \"Yes.\" </p> <p>I wonder whether there is space to get out of the \"victim\" frying-pan without falling into the \"fanatical Islamic terrorist\" fire. The margin is terribly narrow. Then a man sitting with us - clearly an old friend - says: \"But I hear Qassam [Barghouti's 16-year-old son] is down at the barricades. Why don't you stop him?\" Barghouti waves the question away. The man insists: \"You have to stop him.\" And for a moment the militia leader looks helpless: \"I can't,\" he says. \"How can I?\" </p> <p><b> 3.45pm </b><br> </p> <p> Abu Karim is getting restless. He wants to be home in Jerusalem before sunset, but I have asked to see the barricades and now we examine them. An area of desolation at the edge of the town - which means 10 minutes from the center. After sunset this will turn into a battleground. Concrete blocks, stones, burn marks, some shattered glass. Two Israeli army cars on the other side of the concrete. </p> <p>A woman appears from nowhere. Fortyish, poor, dressed in black, she is an Egyptian who has married a Palestinian and lived here for 25 years. Umm Basim, I have heard of her, heard that she lost her eldest son in the previous intifada and that she is in the thick of the action at the barricades every night. </p> <p>Is it because of your son, I ask, that you come here? </p> <p>\"No. I have four more, and they are with me here. I come because this situation has to end. We can't live like this.\" </p> <p>I ask if I may take her photo. She hesitates: \"It won't appear in any Egyptian newspapers? I wouldn't want my mother to know what I'm doing. She'd worry.\" As I take the photo she turns to the man who brought us here: \"I've seen Qassam here. Tell his father to keep him away.\" </p> <p><b> Sunday 10.30am</b><br> </p> <p> Psagot. (\"Bascot,\" the students at Bir Zeit University had said, \"biscuits. Think American cookies.\") </p> <p>Psagot is a settlement built 10 years ago on a hilltop just outside Ramallah and Birah. The Palestinians say it was built by the government (like other settlements) on land expropriated from Birah. They say it was positioned strategically to halt the natural expansion of the town and to control the Arab population. They say the settlers are armed and the army itself can move into the settlement at very short notice. For the past two months Birah and Ramallah have been shelled every night from Psagot. </p> <p>My calls to the Yesha council have paid off and they have sent me here to meet Chaim Bloch. </p> <p>A western journalist connects me to a taxi driver who will go to a settlement (but charges triple), and from the start the journey is unlike any other I've made here. Smooth, wide roads, speeding cars, no roadblocks. And Psagot, like almost every settlement, on the top of a hill like a look-out, like the spooky small town of Edward Scissorhands. Barak's proposed budget for the coming year would spend $300m on settlements. </p> <p>Chaim Bloch is courteously waiting for us outside his house. He is dressed in a suit with a buttoned-up shirt and no tie. He has a longish light-brown beard and speaks softly and carefully. His father, a textile engineer, was offered a job in Israel 31 years ago and within two weeks the family had moved over from Baltimore. I work out that Mr Bloch is 39. I had thought him older. </p> <p>In Israel, if you choose to do religious studies you are exempt from military service. For the young men who want to do both special yeshivas exist. There are 30 of them round the country. Bloch is a graduate of one and, until recently, he had always taught at another. Now he teaches Jewish law as it relates to monetary management as a kind of \"continuing education\" course. He has been in Psagot nine years. </p> <p>Why Psagot? </p> <p>\"Because this is the land of Judea and Samaria. It is here that the Israeli destiny is to be decided.\" </p> <p>The people across the valley, in Ramallah and Birah say this land was expropriated from them. How do you feel about that? </p> <p>\"The government of Israel never takes land without paying for it. The Arabs tried to bring a court case against us and in the end they begged us to allow them to drop it because they were going to be ruined.\" </p> <p>There are UN resolutions stating that the West Bank and Gaza are illegally occupied. </p> <p>\"Israel is a law-abiding nation but there can be differences in the interpretation of the law. What we are doing here is not against international law.\" Then, without pause: \"Even if I was 100% sure that international law was against me it would not change my views. Just because international law says something does not make it so.\" </p> <p>But if not the law, what is your reference? </p> <p>\"God promised us this land. The state of Israel was here 2,000 years ago and God promised this land to our forefathers 37,000 years ago. There was never a state of Palestine here.\" </p> <p>The one thought that I have is that I am not afraid any more, not even uneasy. I feel nothing. I am conducting an interview. </p> <p>Well, I say, there was never Syria or Lebanon or Jordan or Iraq. As states. It was all part of the Ottoman empire and was carved up by the British and the French. </p> <p>\"This is the land promised to us by God.\" </p> <p>OK. You say this land is yours because you were here 2,000 years ago. Across the valley there is a man who says this land is his because he has been here for 2,000 years. If - just for a moment - you put yourself in his position ... </p> <p>\"I do not put myself in his position. You do that for a friend, on a personal matter. This is a question of nations. And my business is to look after the interests of the Jewish nation.\" </p> <p>So you have no individual moral responsibility in this matter? </p> <p>\"No.\" </p> <p>Well, from your point of view, what should the Palestinians do? </p> <p>\"They can go on living here. No-one will throw them out. But they have to understand that they are living in a Jewish state. If they do not like that there are many places where they can go.\" </p> <p>But if they live here, in a Jewish state, they don't have the same rights as the Jews. </p> <p>\"Yes. It is a Jewish state and they live as a minority.\" Believe me, 90% of Palestinians admire us and want to live in the state of Israel.\" </p> <p>I know that a poll among young Palestinians found that they admired Israeli democracy as it was applied to the Jews. But it is not applied to the Arabs. </p> <p>\"Ninety per cent of Palestinians would be happy to live in the state of Israel. I know this.\" </p> <p>You know that 90% of Palestinians would be happy to live as second-class citizens forever? </p> <p>\"This is what my Palestinian friends tell me.\" </p> <p>You have Palestinian friends? </p> <p>\"Yes.\" </p> <p>Forgive me but - who are they? </p> <p>Silence. </p> <p>I don't want to know their names, just - where did you meet them, for example? </p> <p>\"One is a mechanic. He had to fix something for my car. And the other - he knows him. </p> <p>\"Could I just ask you how life on the settlement works - economically? </p> <p>\"How do you mean?\" </p> <p>Well, I've heard that settlements get government help. </p> <p>\"Barak's government has cut back on most of what we got from Netanyahu. We get hardly anything.\" </p> <p>(My companion Judy Blanc ascertains that the house he lives in was bought for a fifth of the market value. For a settler to travel to and from his or her settlement the government provides an armoured bus and two army car escorts. Water, the main resource under government control, is divided between the Arab population and the Israeli settler: each settler is allocated 1,450 cubic meters of water per year. Each Palestinian is allowed to use 83 cubic meters. Electricity is regularly shut down in the Palestinian towns while the settlements are lit up.) </p> <p>Mr Bloch, you have Israel. If you do not allow the Palestinians their own state in the West Bank this conflict will never end. </p> <p>\"Not everything has to be solved now.\" </p> <p>You are happy that your children should inherit this conflict? </p> <p>\"Happy?\" His voice rises, but only slightly. \"My sister was on the bus that they blew up. The woman sitting next to her was killed. Children had to have their limbs amputated. I am not happy.\" </p> <p>But you believe your children should inherit this situation? </p> <p>\"Those children on the bus - I pray that God will never ask me to pay such a terrible price. But if He does, I shall pay it.\" </p> <p>As we drive away from Psagot I feel empty. I look at my notes and realise that I have no impression of what the living room we had been in looked like - except that it was bare and functional and sunny - and looked out on Ramallah. The taxi driver (even with $100 in his pocket) is speeding and angry and has an argument with a speeding young Israeli. Through the window I hear: \"Kess ikhtak!\" (Your sister's c***) </p> <p>Is that the same in Hebrew? I ask. </p> <p>No, that was Arabic, Judy says. </p> <p>\"I see a terrible fire,\" Mme Haniyya had said to me, \"a terrible fire coming to swallow us all, Israelis and Palestinians - unless the Palestinian people are freed from their bondage.\" </p> <p><b> 1.30pm</b><br> </p> <p> On the way back to the bridge I see that the army has dug a brand-new trench between the road and the town of Ariha (Jericho). </p> <p><b> After</b><br> </p> <p> Exhaustion hits me the minute I get to London. This conflict has been part of my life all my life. But seeing it there, on the ground, is different. </p> <p>What can I do except bear witness? </p> <p>I am angrier than before I went. And more incredulous that what is happening in Palestine - every day - to men, women and children, should be allowed by the world to continue. </p> <p>The choices are in the hands of Israel. They can hand over the West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem and live within their borders as a nation among nations. There are no choices for the people of Palestine. </p> <p>Ilan Halevi, a Jew who fought with the PLO, says it's a question of macho image: \"Israel does not want to be seen as 'the fat boy of the Middle East'.\" </p> <p>Others say Israel does not want to be a \"nation among nations\". It wants the beleaguered, plucky image - and the moral indulgence and trillions of dollars worth of aid that goes with it. If that is so then the Israeli government has joined others of the region who are not working in the interests of their own people. </p> <p>Awad Awad [two of whose photos were in the Guardian on Saturday] says the Israelis have declared they will not renew the licences of any Palestinian photographers working with the international media. </p> <p>What will you do? </p> <p>\"Just carry on taking photograhs. I'm a photographer.\" </p> <p>I have seen women pushing their sons behind them, shoving them to run away, screaming at the soldiers: \"Get out of our faces. Stop baiting the kids.\" </p> <p>I have heard a man say: \"I have four sons and no work. I cannot feed them. Let them go out and die if it will help our country; if it will end this state of things.\" </p> <p>I have seen children calmly watch yet another shooting, another funeral. And when I have wept they've said: \"She's new to this.\" </p> <p>I have listened to everybody predict that the leadership would do a deal. \"But if they don't bring us independence and the right of return the streets will catch fire.\" </p> <p>Palestinian weddings are celebrated over coffee, but when a young man is killed his mother is held up over his grave. \"Trill out your zaghrouda [ululation], mother,\" his friends say, the shabab who might die tomorrow. A mother says to me: \"Our joy-cries now only ring out in the face of death. Our world is upside down.\" </p> <p>\u00a9 Ahdaf Soueif </p> <p>\u0095 Some names in this piece have been changed.

      "bodyText": "Thursday For three nights now I have stayed up writing past 2am and yet I have not recorded all I have heard and seen. I have not even really thought about all I have heard and seen - that will come later. For now the present facts are all I can manage. We start early for Ramallah and a couple of minutes from my hotel I see two Israeli flags fixed to the flat roof of a house. Next to them four boys in civilian clothes nurse machine guns. My driver, Abu Karim, says these are four houses that have recently been taken from their Arab residents. Out of Jerusalem, major roads are being built to connect up with the settlements. The roadworks are guarded by Israeli Army trucks. The road north to Ramallah - the road that the Palestinians may use - will lead us through the town of Bira and the news is that Bira was shelled last night. Soon we see the concrete blocks, the waiting cars, the soldiers and we swerve off to the right and drive through dirt roads. Abu Karim points to a rectangular crater in the middle of the road the size of a grave. The army, he says, do this just to make life more difficult. A bone-jolting 20 minutes later we rejoin the main road about one kilometre up from where we had left it. An hour and a half later (and a distance equivalent to, say, Chelsea to Kingston) we are sitting in Rita Haniyya's living-room listening to her and her friend Layla Qasim. The women, one Christian, the other Muslim, are founders of the National Union of Palestinian Women (NUPW) and worked hard to establish the Centre for the Support of the Family in Ramallah, a day-centre where children were taught music and encouraged to draw: \"The children are not allowed to see maps of Palestine or learn their own history,\" they tell me. Eighteen months ago the Israelis closed the centre down for \"inspiring sedition\". \"Sedition!\" snorts Layla Qasim. \"We were trying to help the mothers give their children a 'normal' childhood. You know what the children sing? They sing: 'Papa bought me a trifle/A machine-gun and a rifle'. \"We were struggling to get them to sing normal children's songs. But normal children's songs have nothing to do with the reality of their lives. \"When the children said 'The Jews came and took my cousin/Mixed our rice with the flour and the sugar', we would say don't say the Jews, it's the Israelis, the Zionists. We were battling with the ethics of language.\" \"The media in Britain,\" I say, \"ask why mothers allow their children to go out and throw stones at the army.\" \"Allow?\" says Rita Haniyya, \"You should see the quantities of Valium we've dispensed to women in the camps simply to help them cope with their lives: when their children go out to play they're playing under the guns of the army observation post above them - these people have been living under 'temporary emergency' conditions for 33 years, and some since 1948. They don't go looking for the army, the army is right on their doorstep.\" \"There isn't a child,\" says Layla, \"who doesn't have a father or a brother banished or jailed or killed. When the soldiers come in and beat up a father - the kids see it - all they've got is one room. They see their father being beaten. What do you think it does to them? They ask us if people in the whole world live like this. What can we tell them? A three year old comes in and tells me: 'The Jews came and beat my father and his tummy fell out onto the floor but we got him to hospital and they're going to mend him.'\" The names come thick and fast, Jihad Badr who was bringing up his kid sisters and brothers after their mother died of cancer, who survived an operation for a brain tumour but was killed in the al-Aqsa demonstrations; Hania, 13, who was shot in the leg, bundled into an army car and hit repeatedly on the same leg: \"I didn't scream,\" they tell me she said, \"not because I was feeling brave, just because I was afraid they'd kill me.\" The Hammouri twins, 19, shot on the same day. And on and on. The NUPW now trains women in first aid and civil defence, it organises vaccinations, it gives counselling and advises on home economics (this includes boycotting Israeli and American products). It is funded entirely by donations from its more well-off members - many of them abroad. There are 2m Palestinians in Israel and the occupied territories, 5m in the diaspora. \"We've compromised,\" Rita Haniyya says, \"they have West Jerusalem, the Carmel, Yafa and Haifa and so on. They have Israel. But they want everything, it's their nature. They attack us - physically - in three ways: through the army, the settlers, and the Mustaribs (agents who pretend to be Arab).\" The Mustaribs, she says, mingle with the people during demonstrations: \"They choose a child, grab him, throw their keffiyehs over their faces (so they can mingle again without being identified) whip out their yarmulkes and a gun and rush with the child over to an army car.\" \"You know the worst of it is,\" they say, \"that they keep you guessing. You never know if a road is to be open or closed. When they're going to shut off your water or turn off your electricity. Whether they're going to permit a burial. Whether they're going to give you a permit to travel. You can never ever plan. They create conditions to keep you spinning.\" At Oslo, Israel agreed to hand over some major Arab towns to the Palestinian Authority. Israel, however, retained all the areas surrounding the towns, so that to get from one to another the Palestinians had to carry permits which were checked at Israeli checkpoints. With the intifada the Israeli army simply encircled the towns, preventing the residents from leaving or entering. Critics of Oslo at the time said this was a blueprint for disaster. No one understands why the Palestinian Authority agreed to it. Some say they simply didn't have maps. It is at the soldiers encircling their towns that the youths and children of the intifada throw stones. There are some good Israelis, Rita says, people of conscience. \"Look at what Amira Hass writes in Ha'aretz. And Uri Avnery. But they're marginalised.\" Are you in touch with them? \"Not any more. We realised they would go so far and no further. The best of them balks at the right of return for the refugees. Even Leah Rabin wanted East Jerusalem. At the beginning of the intifadah when they got in touch we said you've been talking to us for years, now it's time for you to talk to your government.\" Back in Jerusalem I break my fast at a small cafe outside al-Zahra Gate. On the street outside is the army car and the soldiers. At the table behind me three elderly men are extolling the days of Gamal Abdul Naser and the idea of pan-Arabism. They end up singing popular Egyptian songs of the 60s: \"Ya Gamal/Beloved of millions\" and \"We said we'd build and now we've built/the Hi-i-gh Dam\". The owner, recognising my Egyptian dialect, gives me a tamarind juice and pudding on the house. He asks if I'm OK at my hotel. His family would have been glad to take me in but they're in al-Khalil (Hebron). He used to commute, it's only half an hour, but now with the closures he can only manage to sneak in to see them once a week. A silent candle-lit demonstration outside the New Gate of the old city. Sixty candles flickered in the hands of 60 Palestinian women just outside the Gate. Opposite them, on the other side of the road 15 Israeli women dressed in black held 15 candles. Friday This is the first Friday of Ramadan and Barak, in a move designed to \"achieve quiet during the month of Ramadan\", has repealed the ban on men under 45 praying at the al-Aqsa mosque. Israeli mounted police, armed and dressed in riot gear, guard the gates of the old city as though we were armed and dangerous football hooligans. We pass through al-Zahra Gate in single file between two rows of soldiers with machine guns. Each man has to stop and show his identity papers. The women, if they keep their heads bowed and their eyes on the ground, are left alone. At Bab Hutta, the actual gate to al-Haram al-Sharif, there are more soldiers with guns. Inside, the men head for al-Aqsa, the women for that choice jewel, the Dome of the Rock. Because the Israeli amnesty does not extend to the people of the West Bank, there are maybe 20,000-25,000 people here today instead of the 500,000 you would normally expect. At the Dome I squeeze in through Bab al-Janna (the Gate of Paradise). In straight lines, shoulder-to-shoulder, we pray then sit to listen to the sermon. The Imam preaches patience, steadfastness and opposition. He reminds us of the Prophet's saying that there are those who fast and gain nothing except hunger; to fast is to renounce falsehood, hypocrisy and all bad deeds. He lists the crimes of the Israeli military occupation against the people. He lists the demands of the people: an end to the occupation, the implementation of UN resolution 242 and the return to the borders of June 4 1967, an independent and sovereign Palestinian state in the West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem, the release of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails, the right of return to the homeland of all Palestinian refugees. He repeats God's promise that the righteous shall prevail, then he prays for al-Aqsa itself. Again and again he implores God to protect it from the plots being woven against it, again and again the women's voices from the Dome and the men's voices from al-Aqsa rise: Amen. The al-Aqsa, where the men pray, is close to Bab el-Magharba (the Gate of the Moroccans) which is close to the Wailing Wall. As prayers end, groups of young men and boys start gathering there. But there the army and police are solidly waiting and everyone knows that if one stone hits that wall someone will be shot. But the shabab [youth] are in the grip of fervour and a man who some say is a \"Fatah element\" starts yelling Hamas slogans and, playing Pied Piper, leads them away from the certain danger of Bab el-Magharba and through the terraces of al-Haram to the relative safety of Bab el-Sabbat. There they stop. Outside the gateway is a police station that they had set fire to a while back. The administrators of the mosque rush to place wooden barriers between the shabab and the small army of soldiers and police taking up positions outside with guns aimed. The shabab chant of the Prophet's victory against the Jews at Khaybar in the 7th century, some of them rush back into the Haram and try to break down the iron door leading to the stairs of the minaret. It will not break. One young man climbs a wall and tries to open a higher door into the minaret. On the walls of the terraces hundreds of women and older men stand and watch. The atmosphere is almost one of carnival. Maybe a thousand shabab are facing the soldiers, but the gate is narrow so it's not too hard for the elders to hold them back. On the steps just opposite the gate, the steps leading up to the top of the city wall, the photographers stand with their cameras, helmets and bullet-proof vests. Something happens outside and the shabab scatter for a moment then regroup. A woman in an embroidered bedouin dress pushes forward into their midst, yelling along with them and a man tries to hold her back: \"They might shoot you!\" \"Let them shoot me. Am I worth more than any of these youngsters?\" A woman in horn-rimmed spectacles waves her arms at the soldiers from the wall where she's standing: \"Get out!\" she shouts, \"Get out! You've strangled us, may God strangle you.\" One young man is ordering his little brother to go home. \"Let me stay,\" the kid begs. \"Just for a few minutes. Let me stay.\" It takes a cuff on the side of the head to send him home. A couple of smallish stones are pitched across the wall. \"Bet that landed on our car,\" a very well-dressed, slim young man says to his companion. A well-built youth picks up a large rock and throws it to the ground to smash it. It doesn't smash and he picks it up again. As he raises it a mosque caretaker runs up and takes it from him, quietly, without a word. He places it carefully under a tree and the young man walks away. An argument is breaking out on the side: \"They shouldn't make trouble,\" a tall, fair man shouts. \"The Israelis will close it down. Let people pray.\" A bystander laughs: \"You've been praying for 50 years. What good has it done you?\" A dimunitive sheikh in a very trim costume and brand-new red cleric's hat is marching measuredly up and down beside the yelling demonstrators with a megaphone: \"Your presence here incites them. Disperse. Disperse.\" No one pays any attention to him except one man who says to his neighbour: \"He does this every Friday.\" There are women and girls sitting chatting under the trees. Eventually the shabab start to drift away. It has taken two hours but this time, here, the Palestinians have no martyrs. Saturday Noon, Ramallah The great hall of Our Lady of the Gospels independent school in Ramallah is filling up with students. Hundreds of girls and boys crowd into the seats talking and laughing. On the stage the principal, Mrs Samira, and the guest speaker, Dr Mustafa Barghouti are setting up the overhead projector. Dr Barghouti is one of the triumvirate heading the People's Party of Palestine, and - more importantly - he has been organising all the medical aid work for the intifada. This talk is part of the independent schools of Ramallah's joint initiative to \"document the truth and demand our legitimate rights before the world\". This group of kids is in economic band A, their parents can afford to educate them privately, can stop them going to the barricades. Their hair is glossy, their teeth are good. As Mrs Samira lists the names of the participating schools they cheer and stamp and she outlaws whistling. They all want to know how they can contribute. They ask why the Authority has not declared Oslo dead? Why it arrests members of Hamas? What is the Authority doing to protect civilians from the attacks of the settlers? Why does the Authority continue to try to coordinate security with the Israelis? They want a programme to support the thousands of workers who've lost their jobs inside Israel. They want the leadership to pull together and an end to the factions. They want to talk to the world. They want independence and they want to know what they can do. Dr Barghouti tells them they can join the NGO across the road. They can be trained in first aid and primary care, in crisis management. They can do media work, monitor the net, respond to articles ... They crowd around to put their names down before they rush off to be picked up by parents at 2.30pm sharp. 3pm, Ramallah Another Barghouti (it's a massive family), Marwan Barghouti, is mostly on the move. He is 41, the chief executive officer of Fatah. Since the intifada he's been on the streets with the shabab and he has formed the People's Watch, groups in each village that try to defend the villagers against the settlers. Everybody says he is targeted by the Israelis (Ma'ariv called him one of the \"triangle of terror: Arafat, Barghouti and Raggoub, head of Palestinian intelligence\"). Some say he's targeted by the Palestinian Authority - for being too popular. In his office, against a huge poster of al-Aqsa, he repeats that the intifada and negotiations do not preclude each other; that the intifada is the only way the people have of projecting their own voice, their own will into the negotiations. He points at a poster of Muhammad al-Durra and says: \"We need to get away from the image of the Palestinian as a victim. This is a better poster,\" pointing at a poster of a child confronting a tank. I say: \"That kid was killed two days later.\" He says: \"Yes.\" I wonder whether there is space to get out of the \"victim\" frying-pan without falling into the \"fanatical Islamic terrorist\" fire. The margin is terribly narrow. Then a man sitting with us - clearly an old friend - says: \"But I hear Qassam [Barghouti's 16-year-old son] is down at the barricades. Why don't you stop him?\" Barghouti waves the question away. The man insists: \"You have to stop him.\" And for a moment the militia leader looks helpless: \"I can't,\" he says. \"How can I?\" 3.45pm Abu Karim is getting restless. He wants to be home in Jerusalem before sunset, but I have asked to see the barricades and now we examine them. An area of desolation at the edge of the town - which means 10 minutes from the center. After sunset this will turn into a battleground. Concrete blocks, stones, burn marks, some shattered glass. Two Israeli army cars on the other side of the concrete. A woman appears from nowhere. Fortyish, poor, dressed in black, she is an Egyptian who has married a Palestinian and lived here for 25 years. Umm Basim, I have heard of her, heard that she lost her eldest son in the previous intifada and that she is in the thick of the action at the barricades every night. Is it because of your son, I ask, that you come here? \"No. I have four more, and they are with me here. I come because this situation has to end. We can't live like this.\" I ask if I may take her photo. She hesitates: \"It won't appear in any Egyptian newspapers? I wouldn't want my mother to know what I'm doing. She'd worry.\" As I take the photo she turns to the man who brought us here: \"I've seen Qassam here. Tell his father to keep him away.\" Sunday 10.30am Psagot. (\"Bascot,\" the students at Bir Zeit University had said, \"biscuits. Think American cookies.\") Psagot is a settlement built 10 years ago on a hilltop just outside Ramallah and Birah. The Palestinians say it was built by the government (like other settlements) on land expropriated from Birah. They say it was positioned strategically to halt the natural expansion of the town and to control the Arab population. They say the settlers are armed and the army itself can move into the settlement at very short notice. For the past two months Birah and Ramallah have been shelled every night from Psagot. My calls to the Yesha council have paid off and they have sent me here to meet Chaim Bloch. A western journalist connects me to a taxi driver who will go to a settlement (but charges triple), and from the start the journey is unlike any other I've made here. Smooth, wide roads, speeding cars, no roadblocks. And Psagot, like almost every settlement, on the top of a hill like a look-out, like the spooky small town of Edward Scissorhands. Barak's proposed budget for the coming year would spend $300m on settlements. Chaim Bloch is courteously waiting for us outside his house. He is dressed in a suit with a buttoned-up shirt and no tie. He has a longish light-brown beard and speaks softly and carefully. His father, a textile engineer, was offered a job in Israel 31 years ago and within two weeks the family had moved over from Baltimore. I work out that Mr Bloch is 39. I had thought him older. In Israel, if you choose to do religious studies you are exempt from military service. For the young men who want to do both special yeshivas exist. There are 30 of them round the country. Bloch is a graduate of one and, until recently, he had always taught at another. Now he teaches Jewish law as it relates to monetary management as a kind of \"continuing education\" course. He has been in Psagot nine years. Why Psagot? \"Because this is the land of Judea and Samaria. It is here that the Israeli destiny is to be decided.\" The people across the valley, in Ramallah and Birah say this land was expropriated from them. How do you feel about that? \"The government of Israel never takes land without paying for it. The Arabs tried to bring a court case against us and in the end they begged us to allow them to drop it because they were going to be ruined.\" There are UN resolutions stating that the West Bank and Gaza are illegally occupied. \"Israel is a law-abiding nation but there can be differences in the interpretation of the law. What we are doing here is not against international law.\" Then, without pause: \"Even if I was 100% sure that international law was against me it would not change my views. Just because international law says something does not make it so.\" But if not the law, what is your reference? \"God promised us this land. The state of Israel was here 2,000 years ago and God promised this land to our forefathers 37,000 years ago. There was never a state of Palestine here.\" The one thought that I have is that I am not afraid any more, not even uneasy. I feel nothing. I am conducting an interview. Well, I say, there was never Syria or Lebanon or Jordan or Iraq. As states. It was all part of the Ottoman empire and was carved up by the British and the French. \"This is the land promised to us by God.\" OK. You say this land is yours because you were here 2,000 years ago. Across the valley there is a man who says this land is his because he has been here for 2,000 years. If - just for a moment - you put yourself in his position ... \"I do not put myself in his position. You do that for a friend, on a personal matter. This is a question of nations. And my business is to look after the interests of the Jewish nation.\" So you have no individual moral responsibility in this matter? \"No.\" Well, from your point of view, what should the Palestinians do? \"They can go on living here. No-one will throw them out. But they have to understand that they are living in a Jewish state. If they do not like that there are many places where they can go.\" But if they live here, in a Jewish state, they don't have the same rights as the Jews. \"Yes. It is a Jewish state and they live as a minority.\" Believe me, 90% of Palestinians admire us and want to live in the state of Israel.\" I know that a poll among young Palestinians found that they admired Israeli democracy as it was applied to the Jews. But it is not applied to the Arabs. \"Ninety per cent of Palestinians would be happy to live in the state of Israel. I know this.\" You know that 90% of Palestinians would be happy to live as second-class citizens forever? \"This is what my Palestinian friends tell me.\" You have Palestinian friends? \"Yes.\" Forgive me but - who are they? Silence. I don't want to know their names, just - where did you meet them, for example? \"One is a mechanic. He had to fix something for my car. And the other - he knows him. \"Could I just ask you how life on the settlement works - economically? \"How do you mean?\" Well, I've heard that settlements get government help. \"Barak's government has cut back on most of what we got from Netanyahu. We get hardly anything.\" (My companion Judy Blanc ascertains that the house he lives in was bought for a fifth of the market value. For a settler to travel to and from his or her settlement the government provides an armoured bus and two army car escorts. Water, the main resource under government control, is divided between the Arab population and the Israeli settler: each settler is allocated 1,450 cubic meters of water per year. Each Palestinian is allowed to use 83 cubic meters. Electricity is regularly shut down in the Palestinian towns while the settlements are lit up.) Mr Bloch, you have Israel. If you do not allow the Palestinians their own state in the West Bank this conflict will never end. \"Not everything has to be solved now.\" You are happy that your children should inherit this conflict? \"Happy?\" His voice rises, but only slightly. \"My sister was on the bus that they blew up. The woman sitting next to her was killed. Children had to have their limbs amputated. I am not happy.\" But you believe your children should inherit this situation? \"Those children on the bus - I pray that God will never ask me to pay such a terrible price. But if He does, I shall pay it.\" As we drive away from Psagot I feel empty. I look at my notes and realise that I have no impression of what the living room we had been in looked like - except that it was bare and functional and sunny - and looked out on Ramallah. The taxi driver (even with $100 in his pocket) is speeding and angry and has an argument with a speeding young Israeli. Through the window I hear: \"Kess ikhtak!\" (Your sister's c***) Is that the same in Hebrew? I ask. No, that was Arabic, Judy says. \"I see a terrible fire,\" Mme Haniyya had said to me, \"a terrible fire coming to swallow us all, Israelis and Palestinians - unless the Palestinian people are freed from their bondage.\" 1.30pm On the way back to the bridge I see that the army has dug a brand-new trench between the road and the town of Ariha (Jericho). After Exhaustion hits me the minute I get to London. This conflict has been part of my life all my life. But seeing it there, on the ground, is different. What can I do except bear witness? I am angrier than before I went. And more incredulous that what is happening in Palestine - every day - to men, women and children, should be allowed by the world to continue. The choices are in the hands of Israel. They can hand over the West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem and live within their borders as a nation among nations. There are no choices for the people of Palestine. Ilan Halevi, a Jew who fought with the PLO, says it's a question of macho image: \"Israel does not want to be seen as 'the fat boy of the Middle East'.\" Others say Israel does not want to be a \"nation among nations\". It wants the beleaguered, plucky image - and the moral indulgence and trillions of dollars worth of aid that goes with it. If that is so then the Israeli government has joined others of the region who are not working in the interests of their own people. Awad Awad [two of whose photos were in the Guardian on Saturday] says the Israelis have declared they will not renew the licences of any Palestinian photographers working with the international media. What will you do? \"Just carry on taking photograhs. I'm a photographer.\" I have seen women pushing their sons behind them, shoving them to run away, screaming at the soldiers: \"Get out of our faces. Stop baiting the kids.\" I have heard a man say: \"I have four sons and no work. I cannot feed them. Let them go out and die if it will help our country; if it will end this state of things.\" I have seen children calmly watch yet another shooting, another funeral. And when I have wept they've said: \"She's new to this.\" I have listened to everybody predict that the leadership would do a deal. \"But if they don't bring us independence and the right of return the streets will catch fire.\" Palestinian weddings are celebrated over coffee, but when a young man is killed his mother is held up over his grave. \"Trill out your zaghrouda [ululation], mother,\" his friends say, the shabab who might die tomorrow. A mother says to me: \"Our joy-cries now only ring out in the face of death. Our world is upside down.\" \u00a9 Ahdaf Soueif \u0095 Some names in this piece have been changed.

      "byline": "John Markoff in San Francisco",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>This will be remembered as the year Microsoft abandoned its PC-centric view of the world. Having successfully turned to confront the threat of the internet in December 1995, the surprisingly agile software maker pirouetted again last summer, proclaiming it would build a computer operating system directly into the fabric of the internet. </p> <p>Creating a network operating system - an idea Microsoft once opposed - is a particularly daring shift in strategy because it goes to the heart of the bitterly contested federal antitrust lawsuit that Microsoft is now appealing. Success in this venture would mean Microsoft completing the internet-centered vision of the shift from the PC desktop first articulated by the Netscape half a decade ago. Over the next five years, the strategy, known as .Net, will transform Microsoft from a purveyor of packaged software increasingly into a supplier of information-age services such as digital wallets, software subscriptions and e-commerce portals. </p> <p>Still, .Net today is merely a statement of direction and a piece of a much bigger picture. Behind the hoopla that has surrounded the .Net proclamation is a more remarkable transformation of Microsoft. </p> <p>The new millennium story for the company that once had a laser focus on the personal computer desktop is that it has decided to place ambitious bets across the whole computer industry. It is a strategy that has not been seen in the computer industry since IBM's domination in the late 1970s to the early 1980s, when it explored technologies ranging through laser videodiscs, satellite communications and home computers. It also puts Microsoft at great risk of overreaching. The question is whether the company will end up on the course charted some years ago by Robert Allen at AT&amp;T, when he tried to create a synergy among many moving parts and failed, or whether it will succeed as John F Welch did with his conglomerate strategy at General Electric. </p> <p>\"They're practically building the casino and setting the odds at each table,\" said Richard Doherty, president of Envisioneering, a computer industry consulting firm in Seaford, New York. </p> <p>Consider just these recently announced initiatives: </p> <p>\u0095 The Xbox video game player will become the company's first big foray into computer hardware and consumer electronics next autumn. </p> <p>\u0095 Ultimate TV is Microsoft's effort to push into the cable set-top box and satellite television market, building on WebTV, its Internet TV service. </p> <p>\u0095 At the high end of the computer industry, the Windows 2000 server edition, introduced during the summer, gave Microsoft an entry into the big-systems software market dominated by IBM., Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard and Compaq. The database initiative, the SQL Server 2000, introduced last summer, competes against Oracle and IBM. </p> <p>\u0095 At the annual Comdex computer show last month, Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman and co-founder, showed off the company's version of the tablet computer, an effort to recharge the personal computer industry with a new package for mobile office and home computing. </p> <p>\u0095 A move into cellular phones is emerging, and Microsoft has publicly outlined its strategy for a cell phone based on Windows CE, a consumer operating system intended for hand-held devices, that will place the software maker in a head-to-head confrontation with the Symbian joint venture backed by Ericsson, Motorola and Nokia. Microsoft this year embarked on its third- generation challenge to Palm with the Pocket PC, operated by a specially tailored version of Windows CE. </p> <p>\u0095 In October, the company refocused on MSN, the Microsoft Internet service provider, in its continuing effort to catch up with America Online. </p> <p>\u0095 This summer, the company brought out a revamped Windows Media Player version to take on RealNetworks players and Apple's Quicktime Media Player. </p> <p>\u0095 Finally, the company's Reader publishing software is an attempt to take on Adobe's Acrobat electronic publishing software and to redefine the publishing market around electronic books. </p> <p>There is a widely held industry view that Microsoft has no choice but to gamble on renewing its growth by entering a wide array of new businesses. The Microsoft stock market miracle clearly ended this year, with the company's stock falling more than 50%, largely - on the surface at least - because of the blow dealt to the software publisher by Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who ruled in the federal antitrust lawsuit that Microsoft be broken into two companies. The ruling has been stayed pending an appeal scheduled for February. </p> <p>Microsoft has doggedly resisted giving any ground in the case, arguing that its software integration approach serves its customers well. Indeed, for almost 15 years, the company's stock has reflected its success, creating in the process a flock of new millionaires. This year, with the stock price down, there has been an exodus of managerial and technical talent - something Microsoft cannot afford if it is to continue to match its internet-era competitors. Moreover, there is concern that there is a saturation point in the growth of the personal computer market that has fuelled Microsoft's growth for 25 years. Microsoft underscored that concern when it said last week that it was facing profit and sales erosion in the quarter that will end on December 31. </p> <p>That point is driven home most clearly by a close look at the company's performance in its last two quarters. While revenue and net income grew and Microsoft was generally given positive marks on Wall Street, operating income in the first quarter, ended September 30, actually fell to $2.78bn (\u00a31.88bn), from $2.79bn a year earlier. And that decline followed an even bigger drop in the fourth quarter, to $2.55bn from $2.93bn in the previous year. Those represent the first quarterly declines in operating income in Microsoft's history as a public company. </p> <p>Even given its strong product cycle dependence and its huge cash reserves, it is clear that the company must quickly find new markets to grow in - hence the decision to attack markets in which it has little experience. </p> <p>It is tempting to acknowledge that the company's most effective tactic - software integration - will give it the same edge in these other industries that it has acquired against its PC industry competitors.

      "bodyText": "This will be remembered as the year Microsoft abandoned its PC-centric view of the world. Having successfully turned to confront the threat of the internet in December 1995, the surprisingly agile software maker pirouetted again last summer, proclaiming it would build a computer operating system directly into the fabric of the internet. Creating a network operating system - an idea Microsoft once opposed - is a particularly daring shift in strategy because it goes to the heart of the bitterly contested federal antitrust lawsuit that Microsoft is now appealing. Success in this venture would mean Microsoft completing the internet-centered vision of the shift from the PC desktop first articulated by the Netscape half a decade ago. Over the next five years, the strategy, known as .Net, will transform Microsoft from a purveyor of packaged software increasingly into a supplier of information-age services such as digital wallets, software subscriptions and e-commerce portals. Still, .Net today is merely a statement of direction and a piece of a much bigger picture. Behind the hoopla that has surrounded the .Net proclamation is a more remarkable transformation of Microsoft. The new millennium story for the company that once had a laser focus on the personal computer desktop is that it has decided to place ambitious bets across the whole computer industry. It is a strategy that has not been seen in the computer industry since IBM's domination in the late 1970s to the early 1980s, when it explored technologies ranging through laser videodiscs, satellite communications and home computers. It also puts Microsoft at great risk of overreaching. The question is whether the company will end up on the course charted some years ago by Robert Allen at AT&amp;T, when he tried to create a synergy among many moving parts and failed, or whether it will succeed as John F Welch did with his conglomerate strategy at General Electric. \"They're practically building the casino and setting the odds at each table,\" said Richard Doherty, president of Envisioneering, a computer industry consulting firm in Seaford, New York. Consider just these recently announced initiatives: \u0095 The Xbox video game player will become the company's first big foray into computer hardware and consumer electronics next autumn. \u0095 Ultimate TV is Microsoft's effort to push into the cable set-top box and satellite television market, building on WebTV, its Internet TV service. \u0095 At the high end of the computer industry, the Windows 2000 server edition, introduced during the summer, gave Microsoft an entry into the big-systems software market dominated by IBM., Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard and Compaq. The database initiative, the SQL Server 2000, introduced last summer, competes against Oracle and IBM. \u0095 At the annual Comdex computer show last month, Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman and co-founder, showed off the company's version of the tablet computer, an effort to recharge the personal computer industry with a new package for mobile office and home computing. \u0095 A move into cellular phones is emerging, and Microsoft has publicly outlined its strategy for a cell phone based on Windows CE, a consumer operating system intended for hand-held devices, that will place the software maker in a head-to-head confrontation with the Symbian joint venture backed by Ericsson, Motorola and Nokia. Microsoft this year embarked on its third- generation challenge to Palm with the Pocket PC, operated by a specially tailored version of Windows CE. \u0095 In October, the company refocused on MSN, the Microsoft Internet service provider, in its continuing effort to catch up with America Online. \u0095 This summer, the company brought out a revamped Windows Media Player version to take on RealNetworks players and Apple's Quicktime Media Player. \u0095 Finally, the company's Reader publishing software is an attempt to take on Adobe's Acrobat electronic publishing software and to redefine the publishing market around electronic books. There is a widely held industry view that Microsoft has no choice but to gamble on renewing its growth by entering a wide array of new businesses. The Microsoft stock market miracle clearly ended this year, with the company's stock falling more than 50%, largely - on the surface at least - because of the blow dealt to the software publisher by Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who ruled in the federal antitrust lawsuit that Microsoft be broken into two companies. The ruling has been stayed pending an appeal scheduled for February. Microsoft has doggedly resisted giving any ground in the case, arguing that its software integration approach serves its customers well. Indeed, for almost 15 years, the company's stock has reflected its success, creating in the process a flock of new millionaires. This year, with the stock price down, there has been an exodus of managerial and technical talent - something Microsoft cannot afford if it is to continue to match its internet-era competitors. Moreover, there is concern that there is a saturation point in the growth of the personal computer market that has fuelled Microsoft's growth for 25 years. Microsoft underscored that concern when it said last week that it was facing profit and sales erosion in the quarter that will end on December 31. That point is driven home most clearly by a close look at the company's performance in its last two quarters. While revenue and net income grew and Microsoft was generally given positive marks on Wall Street, operating income in the first quarter, ended September 30, actually fell to $2.78bn (\u00a31.88bn), from $2.79bn a year earlier. And that decline followed an even bigger drop in the fourth quarter, to $2.55bn from $2.93bn in the previous year. Those represent the first quarterly declines in operating income in Microsoft's history as a public company. Even given its strong product cycle dependence and its huge cash reserves, it is clear that the company must quickly find new markets to grow in - hence the decision to attack markets in which it has little experience. It is tempting to acknowledge that the company's most effective tactic - software integration - will give it the same edge in these other industries that it has acquired against its PC industry competitors. The tactic is indeed being employed in other areas, as witnessed by the company's demonstration of the next version of Office, code-named Office 10, at Comdex. The program integrates such previously independent features as the company's Messenger program directly into its Office program. Although the integration strategy was one that led directly to the antitrust verdict against the company this year, Microsoft has continued to insist that integration is pro-customer, if not pro-competitive. At the same time, the new strategy raises challenges that the software publisher has not faced. One is suggested by a technical analysis buried deep in the October issue of the industry journal Microprocessor Report that presents serious implications for the world's most powerful software company. A group of engineers performed a \"teardown analysis\" on Sony's consumer hit PlayStation 2, the video game player with sales of nearly 5m since its introduction in March. It estimates the manufacturing cost of each PlayStation at $441 - or $41 more than the machine's retail price in Japan and $142 more than its $299 retail price in the United States. The numbers could be sobering for the team that is completing the design of Xbox, Microsoft's first entry into the computer hardware business and a frontal assault on the competitive video game world. While Sony is reportedly losing money on each machine it sold this year - money it hopes to recapture with software sales - Microsoft is planning a computer so powerful that it will dwarf not only the power of the PlayStation 2, but also many of the most powerful desktop computers selling for many times the price. The Xbox will have a faster Intel processing chip, a faster graphics chip from Nvidia, more memory and the addition of a hard disk capable of storing eight gigabytes or more. Some analysts believe Microsoft would run less of a risk than Sony because the software maker has apparently struck sweetheart deals with its main suppliers. There is no escaping the fact that Microsoft has finally crossed the Rubicon. Its plans for the Xbox, as well as other moves put it decisively in the consumer electronics business with its low margins and notoriously fickle consumers. Although Microsoft has enjoyed a relatively warm reception from the mass market, it does not have a great record of producing hit consumer hardware. One has only to remember its most embarrassing venture into consumer computing when, in 1995, it introduced \"Bob,\" a family software agent intended to help users but ending up the object of ridicule. In consumer electronics, Microsoft is definitely in a world where it no longer has any guarantee of success.",

      "bodyText": "The Reebok beer belly, made famous by its latest TV ad, is set to become the must-have present this Christmas as the sportswear company has decided to put miniature toy versions on general sale. Reebok decided today to initially auction off 200 five-inch foam bellies via its website. It said all proceeds would go to charity. It believes they could prove the perfect Christmas gift for portly friends and family in the season of excess. The beer belly icon first appeared in a 40-second Reebok running shoes commercial, created by Lowe Lintas. A runner is seen trying to escape an eight-foot high stomach chasing him down the road. Reebok then made 2,500 miniature toys to celebrate the ad and send out as gifts to a select few. But they have proved so popular that there have been calls in the press for them to be mass-produced. \"They could be the perfect Christmas warning to friends while they are stuffing themselves,\" said a Reebok spokesman. He said that the toys were not yet available but that the company would try to sell them on its website, Reebok.co.uk within the next week or so. The amazingly lifelike belly in Reebok's \u00a34m TV ad was created by Asylum, the model agency whose credits include the Millennium Dome's central Body Zone. Useful link: Reebok.co.uk",

      "body": "<p>\"Labour gambles on modest rise for nurses\", said the Guardian yesterday - and so it turned out when the pay review recommendations were published. But was it a gamble? What if people's satisfaction, or lack of it, with the NHS has little to do with how much money is spent on doctors, nurses and hospitals but is much more a \"political\" judgment related to feelings about the party in power? </p> <p>Apart from questions about voting intentions, the most commonly asked opinion poll question is about (dis)satisfaction with the NHS. Both, of course, are about politics. The entanglement goes further: politics is about the NHS and vice-versa. </p> <p>A typical \"satisfaction\" question was posed in a survey carried out by Mori on behalf of the British Medical Association at the end of November. Of those asked the question \"Overall, how satisfied or dissatisfied are you with the NHS?\", 28% said fairly or very dissatisfied. The BMA made much of the fact that these figures were 11 percentage points higher than in a poll carried out in 1998. </p> <p>Naturally, the Department of Health chose to emphasise the 58% who expressed satisfaction. However, other polls carried out this year have suggested that two-thirds of the population believe that the NHS had not improved since Tony Blair became prime minister. </p> <p>The BMA poll also revealed something about the link between politics and the NHS. Unprompted, three-quarters of those polled thought either the current or the last government was responsible for the current state of the NHS. The BMA's interpretation of their opinion poll results was, unsurprisingly, that the NHS needs more doctors and more money (and also by implication that doctors need more money). </p> <p>But we know that opinion poll results are very sensitive to the exact wording of questions, the order in which they are posed and whether interviews are carried out face to face or over the telephone. We know it is important to be able to tie in respondents' personal characteristics (age, party allegiance) in order to interpret satisfaction results. It is also necessary to track trends in opinions over time rather than to construct over-elaborate interpretations of one-off polls. </p> <p>The best trend data on NHS satisfaction is produced by the British Social Attitudes survey, with data going back to 1983. The graph displays the results - the survey was not done every year, which explains the gaps. Latest results - for 1999 - show that dissatisfaction with the way the NHS is run fell from an all time high of 50% in 1996 to 33% in 1999, its lowest level for more than a decade. But this happened after the notorious 1998-99 winter of NHS discontent. What is going on? </p> <p>One interpretation is that these results reflected a honeymoon period for the Labour government. When the figures are broken down by political allegiance, it is Labour supporters who account for the greatest decrease in dissatisfaction - from 60% in 1996 to 31% in 1999. The fall in dissatisfaction among Tory supporters over the same period was just two percentage points. </p> <p>So, as the BMA poll showed, asking people how they feel about the running of the NHS turns out to be as much a question about the performance of the government of the day as it is about the performance of the health service. So the chart does mirror the changing economic and political fortunes of both the NHS and those charged with its stewardship. </p> <p>Dissatisfaction rose sub stantially during the 1980s, coinciding with historically very low real-terms increases in NHS funding between 1983 and 1989. Then, following the unusually large injection of cash for three years in succession from 1990, dissatisfaction fell. The cycle shifts during the mid 1990s, when the Major government entered the 1997 general elec tion following one of the lowest real increases in NHS funding for many years. Dissatisfaction with the NHS had rocketed and Labour was subsequently elected. </p> <p>However, the fall in dissatisfaction last year does not fit easily with this interpretation based on NHS funding. NHS spending in 1998 and 1999 effectively continued the previous government's parsimony, and yet dissatisfaction fell in both years. </p> <p>Whatever the reason for the ebbs and flows in dissatisfaction, it is by no means certain that the mere knowledge of money being spent on the health service - without visible signs of improvement - will be enough to convince the public that the service is being turned around. The BMA poll certainly suggests otherwise. And, significantly, British Social Attitudes shows that dissatisfaction towards specific components of the NHS (GPs, inpatient, outpatient care, and so on) has remained more or less the same throughout the past few years. </p> <p>More generally, questions about satisfaction are easy to ask; perhaps too easy. The media and the prevailing political climate play a role in shaping and influencing overall perceptions. If we really want to get close to what people feel about the health service, it is much better to ask questions about their personal experience of it: \"how long did you wait to see your GP?\", rather than \"are you satisfied with your GP?\" </p> <p>In the meantime, if you are stopped on the street by pollsters and asked to rate your satisfaction with the health service, try cutting through to the heart of the matter by telling them how you plan to vote in the general election. </p> <p>\u0095 Jo-Ann Mulligan and John Appleby are at the King's Fund. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:j.mulligan@kehf.org.uk\">j.mulligan@kehf.org.uk</a></p>",

If we really want to get close to what people feel about the health service, it is much better to ask questions about their personal experience of it: \"how long did you wait to see your GP?\", rather than \"are you satisfied with your GP?\" In the meantime, if you are stopped on the street by pollsters and asked to rate your satisfaction with the health service, try cutting through to the heart of the matter by telling them how you plan to vote in the general election. \u0095 Jo-Ann Mulligan and John Appleby are at the King's Fund. j.mulligan@kehf.org.uk",

The campaign was based around a scratchcard inserted into magazines and newspapers. Marc Nohr, chairman of the judges, said: \"The army scratchcard won because of its simplicity and efficacy. The simplest of all ideas executed perfectly. \"It showed audience insight in terms of the way it used the media and targeted its audience. It pushed the boundaries and worked.\" The awards are run every year by the DMA in conjunction with the Royal Mail. Other winning agencies were Craik Jones, which took home 12 golds for its work on brands including Virgin Trains and Land Rover; Oneagency, which received accolades for campaigns for Glenmorangie and the Northern Ireland Tourism Board; and Rapier, which picked up awards for its work on Cable &amp; Wireless. KLP Euro RSCG also picked up a gold for its work on the Guardian.",

Have you ever thought of doing some modelling?\" </p> <p>On this occasion, however, the inquiry did not slither to any of the more dodgy conclusions. </p> <p>The questioner really was a photographer, and no, she wasn't talent scouting for any of the Daily Express's new top shelf stablemates. \"She told me she was doing a shoot for Vogue,\" Nina Hauki recalls. </p> <p>The photographer - who, Hauki says, was actually very bashful about making the approach - was a fashion specialist called Vanina Sorrenti, and she proved as good as her word. </p> <p>Within a matter of weeks, the 24-year-old Finnish student was indeed in Vogue, albeit minus clothes. </p> <p>\"She did tell me she was doing pictures for an article about how people see their own bodies, and did warn me that I would be nude.\" </p> <p>If anybody can pull that line off with a stranger they've watched walking past their table with plates of bangers and mash it is your haut-couture snapper. </p> <p>\"I was prepared to do it for Vogue,\" Hauki says. \"Obviously I wouldn't do nude photographs for anybody.\" Hauki was less defensive about the approach than she might have been because she recognised Sorrenti's name and admired her work.

      "bodyText": "It started with one of the oldest lines in the lecher's lexicon. A diner sidled up to a beautiful waitress in a restaurant with a cliche along the lines of: \"I'm a photographer. Have you ever thought of doing some modelling?\" On this occasion, however, the inquiry did not slither to any of the more dodgy conclusions. The questioner really was a photographer, and no, she wasn't talent scouting for any of the Daily Express's new top shelf stablemates. \"She told me she was doing a shoot for Vogue,\" Nina Hauki recalls. The photographer - who, Hauki says, was actually very bashful about making the approach - was a fashion specialist called Vanina Sorrenti, and she proved as good as her word. Within a matter of weeks, the 24-year-old Finnish student was indeed in Vogue, albeit minus clothes. \"She did tell me she was doing pictures for an article about how people see their own bodies, and did warn me that I would be nude.\" If anybody can pull that line off with a stranger they've watched walking past their table with plates of bangers and mash it is your haut-couture snapper. \"I was prepared to do it for Vogue,\" Hauki says. \"Obviously I wouldn't do nude photographs for anybody.\" Hauki was less defensive about the approach than she might have been because she recognised Sorrenti's name and admired her work. She had examples of it in her own sketchbook. This is because Hauki is herself a photography student in the second year of a Btec course and she wants to specialise in fashion work. But now she finds herself in the rare and interesting position of working professionally on the other side of the lens first. Not long after the Vogue appearance, Hauki found herself whisked to Cuba for a fashion shoot. \"Autumn wear, underwear and sparkly Christmas party stuff.\" The biggest break so far came a month or so ago when she became the new Special K girl.

Her dedication is plain, which is why the real benefit of her modelling, even more than the cash it brings, is the insight it gives her into what it is like to be photographed. She senses the experience will make her a better photographer. \"The relationship between photographer and model is important. \"I know now how it feels to be on the other side. It's given me the whole picture.\" Some photographers can be high-handed and autocratic, heedless of the feelings of the person in front of them. Professional models will move as instructed. \"If you just want a pretty face and you order them to smile, they'll do it.\" But the results will be better if there is a proper rapport with someone sympathetic and taking them seriously, Hauki says. \"I think this experience will make me a lot more sensitive to the subjects I shoot.\" Even in her brief modelling career to date she has glimpsed good and bad. \"Vanina is really into pictures where there is this interraction with the model. \"It's very important to her that the model is happy and I think that you see it.

      "body": "<p>If you are a hapless parent whose sons and daughters are returning from university for the Christmas break, the chances are you won't have a \"Scoobie-Doo\" when they tell you that they were \"kettled\" at the \"radio rental\" end-of-term party, where they managed to get off with a right \"swamp donkey\". </p> <p>According to new research conducted by leading linguist Tony McEnery at Lancaster University, students are using a huge corpus of words that are \"currently exclusively in use at campuses around the country\". Increasingly, students are developing a language all of their own, which parents will find almost incomprehensible. </p> <p>Dr McEnery's research, based on his tour of 80 different UK campuses during this year's freshers' week, was commissioned by a student website - <a href=\"http://www.Student-World.co.uk\"> Student-World.co.uk</a> - which is carrying a dictionary of student slang for parents and students trying to communicate with each other this Christmas. </p> <p>McEnery, whose findings are part of his wider research on swearing and abuse in modern English, says: \"Student slang is deeply obsessed with sex, drink, etc, as well as other aspects of student life (staying up all night working, degree classifications, etc).\" </p> <p>He has found that there are no fewer than 18 different words for getting drunk - among them \"kettled\", \"trollied\", \"mullered\" and \"klangered\". </p> <p>A good night out drinking is absolute \"carnage\", which is only second to a \"complete bender\", after which you would be \"coming in with the milk bottles\" (which means you stayed out getting drunk all night). </p> <p>Second to drink comes sex, a serious preoccupation among students. Terms like \"lancing/jousting\", \"boning\", \"get some poot\", \"park your bus\", and \"to go Russell\" are trendy code words. </p> <p>Next to sex, and closely linked with it, are terms that describe ugly people, especially women. There are the usual terms like \"minger\" or \"Jerry Springer\" (rhyming slang), \"munter\" and \"mutt\". </p> <p>There are several different ways to describe different types of ugliness in women. A \"moose\" is a large ugly person; a \"five pinter\" is someone you would only chat up after five pints. There is also the \"mucky duck\", who is an ageing slapper, and the \"swamp donkey\", a large and exceptionally ugly individual, notes McEnery, who is an expert in computational linguistics. </p> <p>There also are numerous slang terms to describe degree classifications. </p> <p>Some of McEnery's own students in Lancaster's linguistics and modern languages department will be getting a \"Geoff Hurst\" (first), while most will receive a Trevor Nunn (2:1). Some will also get a Desmond (Tutu - a 2:2), and a few \"hardcore\" (party-animals) may even get a \"Dan Quayle\" (fail). </p> <p>McEnery says student slang is no different from other types of slang. \"Just as with slang throughout the ages, it is a mix of old and new forms, student-specific and borrowed forms,\" he says. </p> <p>He says student slang isn't a recent phenomenon, but has existed from at least the 18th century. </p> <p>In the mid-18th century, Captain Francis Grose compiled his Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue, which was an early dictionary of British slang. \"When this dictionary was made available to the wider public in 1811,\" he says, \"it had been extended to include the language of the University Wits, as students had already become notable sources of slang words. So student slang has been a noted phenomenon since the late 18th century.\" </p> <p>Although student slang has been around for so long, as an integral part of the language, it has been frowned upon - and still is - \"as a vulgarisation of the language\". </p> <p>As the author of the 1811 dictionary notes: \"Our young men of fashion [students] are as distinguished for the vulgarity of their jargon as the inhabitants of Newgate [prison].\" </p> <p>\"The important thing to remember is that words - like people - can change,\" says McEnery. \"Some words/phrases which appeared in the 1811 dictionary are now so commonplace that people would think it strange that they were ever viewed as slang - 'hoax', 'elbow grease', 'frosty face' and 'fuss' spring to mind. These words have become respectable. So while one generation may view its slang terms as 'vulgar' and 'improper', some of the words may become accepted after a time, so that they cease to be viewed that way.\" </p> <p>Similarly, Tony Thorne, who has been studying student slang for the past three years, says that it is a highly creative form that has made valid contributions to the English language. He says that respectable terms such as \"omnibus\", \"mob\" and \"spondulicks\" all began their life as student slang terms. </p> <p>Thorne, who lectures in lexicology and cultural studies at King's College, London, says that the only reason student slang is frowned upon and not studied seriously is because linguists in Britain have always had a traditional conservative view of language. </p> <p>Both McEnery and Thorne believe student slang needs to be given serious academic attention. \"Student slang remains an evergreen subject for linguists to explore,\" says McEnery. </p> <p>Thorne, whose dictionary of adolescent/student slang, Youthspeak, is due out by the end of next year, says his own study has revealed that \"adolescents are the most creative users of language\". The sources of student slang are very rich and part of the dynamics of a living language at any time. </p> <p>In the past students played with Latin and Greek to coin new slang terms, when these two languages were prevalent in academia. </p> <p>Hence \"spondulicks\", which means money, is ultimately derived from the Greek for sea-shells, which were once used for financial transactions, and \"mob\" is derived from the Latin mobile vulgus, meaning excitable crowd. </p> <p>He says the only difference now is that students tend to draw more on English, Afro-Caribbean creole or black African speech in coining new words. </p> <p>At King's and other cosmopolitan campuses, he has observed that a whole new corpus of slang terms is arising from British-Asian students, where the chief sources are the Indian languages. </p> <p>Terms such as \"gora\" (white) and \"desi\" (Indian native) are gaining a wide currency, as well as terms like \"coconut\", which refers to an individual who is black-Asian on the outside but thinks like a white person inside. </p> <p>Whereas it was the white student groups that produced the slangs in the past, followed by Afro-Caribbeans, now increasingly it is Asian students who are becoming increasingly confident about themselves in British campuses, argues Thorne. And student slang is reflecting the \"multi-ethnic, multicultural and multi-regional\" make-up of the British student population. </p> <p>Both McEnery and Thorne agree that an overwhelming amount of student slang is based around leisure activities such as drinking and romancing and very little on books and study. </p> <p>But to them it does not indicate that British students are neglecting their study, and concentrating too much on social activities. </p> <p>Rather, argues McEnery, students use slang to talk about \"taboo\" matters such as sex and drinking, which need a certain \"codedness\". \"Studying, mercifully, is not taboo amongst students, so the need to code discussions is reduced,\" he says. </p> <p>Thorne adds that in formal contexts such as seminars and lectures standard English is used so there is no need to create slang terms. </p> <p>But Thorne admits that British students have an overwhelmingly large vocabulary to describe \"pleasure activities\" - much better than that of their counterparts in other countries, such as America. </p> <p>\"We've found that 75% of student slang in Britain is about drinking and getting drunk,\" says Thorne. </p> <p>This is in stark contrast to a representative US campus such as North Carolina University, where only 10% of their slang terms are about drinking. Similarly, around 10% of British student slang term is about sex, compared with only 5% in US campuses. </p> <p>\"This doesn't mean that British students are drunk all the time and oversexed - it means they just like talking about it,\" says Thorne. But it indicates a change in lifestyle and attitudes amongst students. \"It seems that British students are actually pioneering a new kind of lifestyle which is hedonistic.\" </p> <p>He adds that this lifestyle and the accompanying slang are not an act of defiance against authority. There are very few slang terms for authority figures, suggesting very little interest or concern with that. Student lifestyle is apolitical and purely pleasure-based, says Thorne. </p> <p>He think the hedonism may be part of \"self-experimentation\" and self-discovery, which is increasingly what, for most students, the three or four years of university life are all about.</p>",

As the author of the 1811 dictionary notes: \"Our young men of fashion [students] are as distinguished for the vulgarity of their jargon as the inhabitants of Newgate [prison].\" \"The important thing to remember is that words - like people - can change,\" says McEnery. \"Some words/phrases which appeared in the 1811 dictionary are now so commonplace that people would think it strange that they were ever viewed as slang - 'hoax', 'elbow grease', 'frosty face' and 'fuss' spring to mind. These words have become respectable. So while one generation may view its slang terms as 'vulgar' and 'improper', some of the words may become accepted after a time, so that they cease to be viewed that way.\" Similarly, Tony Thorne, who has been studying student slang for the past three years, says that it is a highly creative form that has made valid contributions to the English language. He says that respectable terms such as \"omnibus\", \"mob\" and \"spondulicks\" all began their life as student slang terms. Thorne, who lectures in lexicology and cultural studies at King's College, London, says that the only reason student slang is frowned upon and not studied seriously is because linguists in Britain have always had a traditional conservative view of language. Both McEnery and Thorne believe student slang needs to be given serious academic attention. \"Student slang remains an evergreen subject for linguists to explore,\" says McEnery. Thorne, whose dictionary of adolescent/student slang, Youthspeak, is due out by the end of next year, says his own study has revealed that \"adolescents are the most creative users of language\". The sources of student slang are very rich and part of the dynamics of a living language at any time. In the past students played with Latin and Greek to coin new slang terms, when these two languages were prevalent in academia. Hence \"spondulicks\", which means money, is ultimately derived from the Greek for sea-shells, which were once used for financial transactions, and \"mob\" is derived from the Latin mobile vulgus, meaning excitable crowd. He says the only difference now is that students tend to draw more on English, Afro-Caribbean creole or black African speech in coining new words. At King's and other cosmopolitan campuses, he has observed that a whole new corpus of slang terms is arising from British-Asian students, where the chief sources are the Indian languages. Terms such as \"gora\" (white) and \"desi\" (Indian native) are gaining a wide currency, as well as terms like \"coconut\", which refers to an individual who is black-Asian on the outside but thinks like a white person inside. Whereas it was the white student groups that produced the slangs in the past, followed by Afro-Caribbeans, now increasingly it is Asian students who are becoming increasingly confident about themselves in British campuses, argues Thorne. And student slang is reflecting the \"multi-ethnic, multicultural and multi-regional\" make-up of the British student population. Both McEnery and Thorne agree that an overwhelming amount of student slang is based around leisure activities such as drinking and romancing and very little on books and study. But to them it does not indicate that British students are neglecting their study, and concentrating too much on social activities. Rather, argues McEnery, students use slang to talk about \"taboo\" matters such as sex and drinking, which need a certain \"codedness\". \"Studying, mercifully, is not taboo amongst students, so the need to code discussions is reduced,\" he says. Thorne adds that in formal contexts such as seminars and lectures standard English is used so there is no need to create slang terms. But Thorne admits that British students have an overwhelmingly large vocabulary to describe \"pleasure activities\" - much better than that of their counterparts in other countries, such as America. \"We've found that 75% of student slang in Britain is about drinking and getting drunk,\" says Thorne. This is in stark contrast to a representative US campus such as North Carolina University, where only 10% of their slang terms are about drinking. Similarly, around 10% of British student slang term is about sex, compared with only 5% in US campuses. \"This doesn't mean that British students are drunk all the time and oversexed - it means they just like talking about it,\" says Thorne. But it indicates a change in lifestyle and attitudes amongst students. \"It seems that British students are actually pioneering a new kind of lifestyle which is hedonistic.\" He adds that this lifestyle and the accompanying slang are not an act of defiance against authority. There are very few slang terms for authority figures, suggesting very little interest or concern with that. Student lifestyle is apolitical and purely pleasure-based, says Thorne. He think the hedonism may be part of \"self-experimentation\" and self-discovery, which is increasingly what, for most students, the three or four years of university life are all about.",

Which left either the first world war soldier - it was clearly to be a pioneering, post-modern production - or Joseph. He was dead set on the soldier as it gave him carte blanche to take a gun into school. My wife and I weren't so keen. Not because we're peaceniks, but because it was so clearly going to be a hassle trying to knock up a soldier costume. Joseph was easy. He's a sheet. </p> <p>\"I think you should be Joseph,\" I said. </p> <p>\"Why?\" </p> <p>\"Because he's a central character in the nativity play.\" </p> <p>Which is true, though not as it happened in this nativity play, where Robbie would be destined to be just one of 27 Josephs. </p> <p>\"OK, then,\" he muttered. </p> <p>So last week we wrapped him up in a sheet and packed him off to school - without the hastily improvised halo that had been attached to his sister's hairband and had been predictably rejected for being cissy. Two hours later, my wife and I trooped into the school hall to witness the miracle of the nativity. There was no danger of Jesus's birth going unrecorded here, as almost every member of the audience was wielding a video recorder or a digicam. Except us, which was perhaps just as well, as Robbie thought it was hysterically amusing to spend virtually the entire performance hiding behind a few other Josephs and assorted livestock. Just occasionally he bobbed into view, only to disappear grinning inanely as soon as he had caught our eye. </p> <p>But then maybe Robbie had a point. This nativity play felt as if it was being acted out in real time, as the school was anxious to give every class its moment in the spotlight, and in the hour or so it took for the Good News to be well and truly spread, I'm sure I was not the only member of the audience on the brink of coma. </p> <p>Forgive me for sounding jaded. I know you're supposed to fill with tears at the very thought of the little treasures giving it their all for Jesus, and to be fair that's the way I felt for the first couple of nativity plays that I went to. But my daughter, Anna, is now nearly nine and with Robbie having already appeared in a couple of shows at nursery, I'm almost into double figures. You name it, I've seen it. Traditional, multicultural and just plain bizarre: they're all as dreary as each other. </p> <p>It would be different, I suspect, if my children had ever been asked to play a starring role in proceedings. Or a co-starring role. Or a supporting role. Anything other than a walk-on part as an extra, in fact. The catalogue of obscurity began when Anna was at nursery school. </p> <p>\"Who are you going to be, darling?\" I asked eagerly. </p> <p>\"I'm the third narrator,\" she replied proudly. \"It's very important.\" </p> <p>May her teacher rot in hell for that lie. </p> <p>\"Of course it is. Well done,\" I added doubtfully. </p> <p>Come the big day, we sat dutifully while the chosen few recited most of the New Testament, waiting for Anna's big moment. Eventually she wandered on from stage left. \"Lo, a star appeared,\" she annunciated, before herself disappearing stage right. And that was that. It was almost the same story the following year: she had graduated to second angel but it was still a case of blink and you've missed it. It's been much the same ever since and, as Robbie appears to have inherited a similar theatrical insignificance - his first role was as fourth donkey - it's hard not to take it personally. </p> <p>You see, over the years I've noticed that it's pretty much the same group of people who get the leading roles every year. They're bright, socially accomplished, squeaky clean. And, in my opinion, hideously precocious. It's as if they've been born with a social identifier that marks them out as future prefects and general all-round high-fliers, to which their teachers unconsciously defer. That Anna and Robbie have been mysteriously omitted from this elite I find bewildering. What's more, whenever I see the \u00fcberkinder poncing around on stage, I start wishing teenage pregnancies and drug addiction on them. </p> <p>In their more honest moments, other parents have told me they feel exactly the same way.

      "body": "<p>A Tory MP yesterday described how he acted on instinct to protect his wife and two-month-old baby when a drunk, mentally ill intruder forced her way into their home.</p> <p>Andrew Mackay, the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, grappled with the screaming woman, who had fled the nearby Gordon psychiatric hospital, and knocked her to the floor of the Westminster town house he shares with his wife, Julie Kirkbride, the Tory MP for Bromsgove.</p> <p>\"These things are so split second,\" he said. \"My reaction was that this was an unwelcome intruder, who had barged past my wife while my baby and young nanny were downstairs. She was clearly a danger to us - and my first and immediate thought was that I had to control her.\"</p> <p>The altercation came at around 9pm on Sunday after the doorbell rang. Because of the security threat of Mr Mackay's job, Ms Kirkbride opened the door and was struck by the force of a stocky woman.</p> <p>\"The door was thrown back on me and I tried to push her but she was on her front foot and I was on my back so she pushed her way in. She screamed that she needed help and ran into the house,\" Ms Kirkbride recalled yesterday</p> <p>Mr Mackay, alerted by his wife's screams, rushed to stop the woman, who was in her 30s. \"I just caught her and brought her to the ground. I just pushed her and then held her wrists\", he said.</p> <p>The nanny rang the police who arrived within five minutes. The woman, a voluntary psychiatric patient, was not charged but returned to the hospital on the same square in which the MPs live. It emerged she had been involved in a fracas after drinking in Victoria and had fled to the Mackays after being detained by a nurse.</p> <p>Last night, Ms Kirkbride, 40, who was confronted by a burglar wielding a knife in the house earlier this summer, said: \"This was less terrifying than the last time, but only because I wasn't alone: my have-a-go hero husband was there.\"</p> <p>Ms Kirkbride added that the latest incident highlighted the problem of falling numbers in the Metropolitan police force. This month, the commissioner Sir John Stevens warned the Met was 3,000 officers short.</p> <p>Mr Mackay, 51, the MP for Bracknell, said their ordeal illustrated the need for a reform of the Mental Health Act to force potentially dangerous patients to be detained against their will if necessary.</p> <p>The white paper on mental health, published tomorrow, will include this proposal but patients such as the one who entered the Mackay home would not be included. A spokesman for the Gordon hospital, where she had been a voluntary residential patient for a few years, stressed she had not been sectioned.</p>",

Andrew Mackay, the shadow Northern Ireland secretary, grappled with the screaming woman, who had fled the nearby Gordon psychiatric hospital, and knocked her to the floor of the Westminster town house he shares with his wife, Julie Kirkbride, the Tory MP for Bromsgove. \"These things are so split second,\" he said. \"My reaction was that this was an unwelcome intruder, who had barged past my wife while my baby and young nanny were downstairs. She was clearly a danger to us - and my first and immediate thought was that I had to control her.\" The altercation came at around 9pm on Sunday after the doorbell rang. Because of the security threat of Mr Mackay's job, Ms Kirkbride opened the door and was struck by the force of a stocky woman. \"The door was thrown back on me and I tried to push her but she was on her front foot and I was on my back so she pushed her way in. She screamed that she needed help and ran into the house,\" Ms Kirkbride recalled yesterday Mr Mackay, alerted by his wife's screams, rushed to stop the woman, who was in her 30s. \"I just caught her and brought her to the ground. I just pushed her and then held her wrists\", he said. The nanny rang the police who arrived within five minutes. The woman, a voluntary psychiatric patient, was not charged but returned to the hospital on the same square in which the MPs live. It emerged she had been involved in a fracas after drinking in Victoria and had fled to the Mackays after being detained by a nurse. Last night, Ms Kirkbride, 40, who was confronted by a burglar wielding a knife in the house earlier this summer, said: \"This was less terrifying than the last time, but only because I wasn't alone: my have-a-go hero husband was there.\" Ms Kirkbride added that the latest incident highlighted the problem of falling numbers in the Metropolitan police force. This month, the commissioner Sir John Stevens warned the Met was 3,000 officers short. Mr Mackay, 51, the MP for Bracknell, said their ordeal illustrated the need for a reform of the Mental Health Act to force potentially dangerous patients to be detained against their will if necessary. The white paper on mental health, published tomorrow, will include this proposal but patients such as the one who entered the Mackay home would not be included. A spokesman for the Gordon hospital, where she had been a voluntary residential patient for a few years, stressed she had not been sectioned.",

It would have been better if we had something nearer 5%. \"Nursing is a very difficult job. Morale is very low and has been for quite some time - it is not just about pay. \"The staff shortages are also having an effect on the wards. It is quite demanding working on an acute medical ward. I didn't realise how much of a strain nursing would be. \"It is not easy when you come home because you can't just switch off from work. When I was training, I didn't realise how demanding a job it would be. \"If I am working a late shift, I don't get home until 10pm and then I can be starting work again the next day at 7.30am. By the time I wind down, it's 12 o'clock before I get to bed and then you are up again and ready to start work.\" \"At this time of year there are extra pressures with the demands for beds which makes things difficult. \"The people I trained with feel the same way - we are all despondent. I didn't come into nursing because of the pay, it was because I love the job of nursing.",

Ingle, 28, was knocked down in the 12th round of his defence of the International Boxing Federation featherweight title by Mbulelo Botile of South Africa at the Sheffield Arena on Saturday night.</p> <p>Mr Wyatt also sent a letter to the home secretary, Jack Straw, urging him to make the wearing of headguards compulsory for professional boxers.</p> <p>The select committee is also keen to see independent research carried out to assess the impact on boxing. Another proposal is for medical examinations on all professional British boxers who have fought world championship bouts over the past 20 years.</p> <p>If members of the committee agree to hold an inquiry then evidence will also be taken from former boxers, promoters, trainers and doctors.</p> <p>Mr Wyatt stressed that the committee did not want to impose a ban on boxing but believed that greater safeguards needed to be introduced.</p> <p>He said: \"A full and proper independent investigation needs to be held into boxing and the long term damage it is causing boxers.

      "bodyText": "A proposal to hold a full parliamentary inquiry into boxing is to be considered by MPs today as political concern mounts over the sport's safety record. Derek Wyatt, the Labour MP for Sittingbourne and Sheppey and a member of the select committee on sport which meets today, is to propose that an inquiry be held so that new safeguards can be introduced. Britain's injured boxer Paul Ingle is meanwhile still in a coma but showing encouraging signs of improvement according to surgeons in Sheffield who are treating him for severe brain and head injuries. Ingle, 28, was knocked down in the 12th round of his defence of the International Boxing Federation featherweight title by Mbulelo Botile of South Africa at the Sheffield Arena on Saturday night. Mr Wyatt also sent a letter to the home secretary, Jack Straw, urging him to make the wearing of headguards compulsory for professional boxers. The select committee is also keen to see independent research carried out to assess the impact on boxing. Another proposal is for medical examinations on all professional British boxers who have fought world championship bouts over the past 20 years. If members of the committee agree to hold an inquiry then evidence will also be taken from former boxers, promoters, trainers and doctors. Mr Wyatt stressed that the committee did not want to impose a ban on boxing but believed that greater safeguards needed to be introduced. He said: \"A full and proper independent investigation needs to be held into boxing and the long term damage it is causing boxers. I am very concerned at the situation and what happened to Paul Ingle was very shocking.\" In a further political development, Paul Flynn, the Labour MP for Newport West, yesterday reiterated his plan to introduce a law that would make punches to the head in boxing illegal. Mr Flynn said: \"Boxing is unique in encouraging blows to the head. A boxer can receive hundreds of blows to the head in a single bout. The new law would outlaw blows to the head in the same way that blows below the waist are banned now. \"At present, if boxers kill or maim opponents in the ring they can't be charged with assault or manslaughter because they have a defence they were acting within the rules.\" All amateur boxers have to wear headguards and larger gloves than their professional counterparts to soften the impact of blows. Demands by some MPs that headguards should be made compulsory for professional boxers were criticised yesterday by the British Boxing Board of Control, the governing body. The general secretary, Simon Block, said: \"The introduction of headgear to professional fights is unlikely to happen and unlikely to make a difference. In fact, all the medical evidence shows that it can make brain injuries worse.\" Last night, David Battersby, the consultant neurosurgeon treating Ingle, said the boxer was making good progress. \"Over the course of the day we have lightened his sedation and he is now making movements which are very encouraging,\" said Mr Battersby. \"We are now at the stage of looking after the secondary effects of a head injury.\" Ingle will remain in intensive care until the end of the week at least, with his fiancee, Samantha Coulson, and his family, only permitted short spells at his bedside in the Royal Hallamshire hospital. A statement from Ingle's family was released last night by Ms Coulson who is due to marry the boxer next year. She said: \"We have been with him since the accident happened. He is still critical and we are playing a waiting game.\" The row over boxing is set to be further fuelled by a court of appeal ruling today on whether the sport's British regulators are liable to pay compensation to the brain-damaged Michael Watson. Three judges will give judgment on an appeal by the British Boxing Board of Control against a high court decision which awarded Watson \u00a31m after a fight with Chris Eubank in 1991 left him partly paralysed. In a case of vital importance to other sporting bodies, the BBBC, which went into administrative receivership after the high court ruling, has argued that it owed Watson no duty of care.",

Fifteen civil servants and five ministers were criticised by Lord Phillips's inquiry into the disaster. Many of the civil servants have subsequently resigned or retired. Ministers responded to the Phillips report two months ago by setting up a review led by Sheila Forbes, a civil service commissioner. Her recommendations may be published in the next few days to lift the shadow hanging over the civil servants' careers. In setting up the Forbes inquiry, the agriculture secretary, Nick Brown, hinted strongly he was personally opposed to disciplinary action against civil servants. He told MPs last month: \"Whenever serving public servants are subjected to criticism by a public inquiry, the question arises whether any form of disciplinary action should be taken\". He then quoted from the Phillips report, which said: \"If those criticised were misguided, they were nonetheless acting in accordance with what they conceived to be the proper performance of their duties\". Mr Brown also stressed in his Commons statement that some of the individuals criticised receive praise from the inquiry, but there is no corresponding list of individuals who are praised. The Phillips inquiry criticised the individuals, mainly in the Ministry of Agriculture and Department of Health, on the grounds that they should have acted differently in light of the information that they had available at the time. The bulk of the criticism cen tered on civil servants failing to do more to bring the potential dangers of BSE to ministers attention. Amongst civil servants criticised include William Rees, chief veterinary officer between 1980 and 1988, and his successor up to 1997, Keith Meldrum. The report also highlighted deficiencies by Sir Keith Calman the chief medical officer to 1998. Phillips also attacked the head of the ministry of agriculture animal health division Robert Lowson. The chief medical officer for Scotland between 1991-1996, Robert Kendell, was also criticised for misleading statements about the safety of beef. The report also criticised Thomas Eddy, head of Maff animal health (disease control) division from June 1993 for misleading minutes concerning the possibility that CJD cases in young people might prove to be linked with BSE.",

      "bodyText": "By 4.15pm the control at British Transport police north-east region had logged a long list of incidents. Three youths were putting objects on the line at Ashington colliery; a large group of youths was abseiling off a viaduct at Baildon, West Yorkshire; some kids were messing about with a signal box at Dewsbury; some were on a bridge in nearby Ravens- thorpe, others in Deighton. Three youths threw a pram at a train from a bridge in Stockton and a group of youths entered a tunnel, diverting a train because police could not be sure what they had left behind. This is the reality of vandalism on the railways, another huge problem for the chaotic network. Acts of trespass and vandalism are the biggest threat to the safety of rail passengers; there is one incident every 15 minutes across the network and it gets worse during school holidays. There have been five child fatalities this year already. In October, just days after the Hatfield derailment, a passenger train hit a concrete block placed on the line by vandals. No one was hurt but the train was held up for more than an hour afterwards. In July, two girls, Kymberley Allcock, eight, and Sophie George, seven, were killed by a Lincoln to Aberystwyth train as they played on a railway bridge. The health and safety executive annual report shows that 55% of train incidents are due to acts of vandalism and last month the chief inspector of railways warned that incidence of vandalism and trespass was on the increase. It now costs around \u00a3260m a year. PC Tom Lake has been with the transport police in Newcastle for more than 20 years. He and his colleagues are constantly frustrated by persistent vandals and trespassers. As he drives along the side of a railway track running between Newcastle and Sunderland he spots a youth on a scrambler bike riding up and down the rails. The 18-year-old thinks it is fun and he is oblivious to the danger. When the police get hold of him the boy is aggressive and cheeky. He says: \"It wasn't me. It must have been somebody else on another bike.\" Behind him, four woolly-hatted teenagers are full of bravado. As the officers walk away, the boys pick up stones and begin throwing them into the air, just missing the officers. As the car drives off they throw more stones then stick their fingers up in defiance. Vandals can be difficult to catch and difficult to police. PC Lake says: \"In the holidays, they get bored and end up having a go at the trains. \"A lot of them don't realise a train cannot stop, that it's not a car and it cannot overtake. Basically the thing will kill you and there's no discussion about it.\" The constable is graphic when he describes the impact a train can have on the human body.

They scarper as they see the bright orange jackets of the transport police. All along the side of the line you can see what gets dumped at, and sometimes on, the railway.

These offences, however, are taken too lightly, according to PC Lake and his colleagues. \"Trespass and vandalism is looked at by some people as a tuppence ha'penny offence,\" he says. In an attempt to get the figures down and make people realise the real dangers of the railway, the transport police have launched Operation Scarecrow, which is aimed at catching and prosecuting vandals and trespassers. Various measures are used including patrolling the network by helicopter fitted with thermal-imaging equipment. Chief Inspector Graham Hobson says: \"Unfortunately the nature of the railway is that it attracts young boys down to see trains, then boredom sets in and from just having a look they start putting things on the track. \"The moment you say to them 'so why aren't you playing on the motorway' they say 'because it's dangerous'. I have found that whenever we say to kids, why did you do this, they always say it was something to do. I just wanted to see what happened, my mate did it so I did it. I was bored.\" Mr Hobson's region, the north-east, has a greater incidence of vandalism and trespass than some southern counterparts. As an officer he has seen the aftermath of the offences and an escalation of them over the past 10 years. He says: \"One of the worst jobs on the railway for insecurity must be the train driver's job. I know drivers who say when they come to a bridge, where they used to wave at the kids, they now put their hand in front of their face.\"",

      "body": "<p>After Saturday's splash headline on the Times front page - \"Nurses win 8% pay rise ahead of election\" - there was bound to be disappointment yesterday. Some senior nurses, sisters and charge nurses, in the top four grades will (with the new cost of living supplement and inner-London weighting) get increases of 8% or more starting in April.</p> <p>At the bottom end of the pay scale, yesterday's report from the pay review body expresses \"particular concern\" for nurse auxiliaries, calling for the new pay system currently under negotiation to take on board their problems as \"a matter or urgency\". But the main nursing army - some 430,000 or more - will only receive a 3.7% pay rise.</p> <p>The special rises for senior nurses - outside London they are getting 5% - is needed.

      "bodyText": "After Saturday's splash headline on the Times front page - \"Nurses win 8% pay rise ahead of election\" - there was bound to be disappointment yesterday. Some senior nurses, sisters and charge nurses, in the top four grades will (with the new cost of living supplement and inner-London weighting) get increases of 8% or more starting in April. At the bottom end of the pay scale, yesterday's report from the pay review body expresses \"particular concern\" for nurse auxiliaries, calling for the new pay system currently under negotiation to take on board their problems as \"a matter or urgency\". But the main nursing army - some 430,000 or more - will only receive a 3.7% pay rise. The special rises for senior nurses - outside London they are getting 5% - is needed. As yesterday's report notes, the structure of the profession has historically been too flat, with differentials that are much too small and which fail to recognise the real differences in skills and responsibility that exist. Under the government's 10-year modernisation plan, the 70,000 nurses in senior grades will have a crucial role in breaking down current demarcation boundaries between the medical professions.

A cathedral worker raised the alarm at midday after spotting an abandoned sack leaning against a gargoyle on the northern end of the roof terrace. A clock was set to detonate the 1kg (2.2lb) of explosive powder at 3am, avoiding casualties but damaging the 15th-century masterpiece of hundreds of spires and statues. Around 130 tourists on the roof were evacuated while a bomb disposal team moved in to make safe what it described as a crude device. Terrorists are suspected, but the police thought it was unlikely to be the work of the Red Brigade, whose shootings and bombings terrorised Italy in the 1970s and 80s. Last June a knapsack with a crude bomb was discovered in the basilica of Sant'Ambrogio. A previously unknown anarchist group called International Solidarity claimed responsibility and demanded the release of jailed comrades. Yesterday's bomb could have exploded prematurely but the blast would have been too small to cause serious injury, an investigator said. An interior ministry undersecretary, Massimo Brutti, told the senate in Rome that the investigation, to be led by Stefano Dambruoso, would explore all avenues.

Six motions in favour of changing the timetable have been tabled because President Jacques Chirac's early dissolution of parliament in 1997 means that for the first time in modern French history general elections should be held two months before the presidential election. Those seeking a change, mainly leftwingers, say that is putting the cart before the horse: how can voters be expected to accept or reject a government programme before deciding which political direction they prefer? \"The interests of democracy and of the republic are at stake,\" the Socialist prime minister, Lionel Jospin, said. \"What we propose is to re-establish a situation that is normal, logical, and coherent with the principles of the way our republic is supposed to function.\" The unspoken political point behind that argument is that Mr Chirac hopes the conservative parties will win the parliamentary elections, due in March, thus discrediting Mr Jospin's campaign for the presidency in May. But rightwingers opposed to delaying the parliamentary elections by two months have denounced the motions as a political manoeuvre by Mr Jospin to boost his chance of beating Mr Chirac in the presidential election without damaging the left's prospects in the general election. \"This is a measure of circumstance, of convenience, which does not seem to me very suitable given that it does not respect the principle according to which one cannot suddenly change the rules in a democracy so close to the date,\" Mr Chirac said last week. Constitutional experts predict mayhem if the electoral calendar is not reversed. The candidates for the presidency, they point out, must be approved by a total of 500 MPs - who may not even be elected in time if the dates are not changed. The debate has divided deputes along unaccustomed lines, the opposition RPR drawing strong support from two key players in Mr Jospin's leftwing coalition: the Greens and the Communists. Both fear that voters will see a change of dates as underhand. \"I am very concerned that any such change could be interpreted first as a sleight-of-hand and secondly as greatly increasing the status of the president vis-a-vis parliament,\" the Communist transport minister, Jean-Claude Gayssot, said yesterday. But the prime minister is assured of help from an equally unexpected source: the centre-right UDF led by former president Val\u00e9ry Giscard-d'Estaing. Observers say that as many as 35 UDF deputies are determined to resist pressure from their opposition partners, Mr Chirac's RPR, and side with the Socialists. Mr Giscard, the former UDF prime minister Raymond Barre, and the party's current leader, Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou, all back change. \"The choice of president is the choice that gives France its direction, and it should naturally come first,\" Mr Giscard wrote in Le Monde. So political has the essentially constitutional debate become that Jean-Louis Debr\u00e9, leader of the RPR in parliament, called it \"a trap designed to implode the opposition\" - a view shared by the radical Green Danny Cohn-Bendit, who said all on the left should recognise it as such and applaud Mr Jospin for so successfully torpedoing the right. The question, which Mr Jospin hopes will be settled by a vote before February, arises because the constitution of the Fifth Republic does not adequately foresee the possibility of a president and a government of opposing political hue. The electoral code stipulates that \"the national assembly's powers end on the first Tuesday in the April of the fifth year following its election\", while the constitution states that the presidential mandate expires precisely seven years - now reduced to five for the next president - after his accession.",

It is thought that Michael Hodder, the driver of the Thames train, was deceived by a \"phantom aspect\" - a red light which appeared to be amber - before he crashed into the oncoming Great Western express.</p> <p>Experts who had looked at signals in the Paddington area, in particular signal 109, had concluded that \"the complexity of the layout and signal gantries, the range of approaches and the obscuration of the signal aspects by overhead line equipment present an exceptionally difficult signal reading task\", yesterday's HSE report concluded.</p> <p>It added that while the height of the signals on the gantry that carried signal 109 broadly met requirements \"many of the other signals in the Paddington area on the approach to signal 109 are at a height in excess of that permitted by Railway Group Standards - although when the signals were designed and installed, no maximum height was specified.\"</p> <p>Signals needed to be aligned to maximise their readability. This was particularly important on east-west lines such as those around Paddington where a low sun can come into play, the report added.</p> <p>The crash on October 5, 1999, left 31 people dead, including Mr Hodder, 31, who went through signal 109.</p> <p>His train, heading for Bedwyn in Wiltshire, travelled another 700 metres before colliding almost head-on at Ladbroke Grove with the Great Western train which had started out from Cheltenham Spa station in Gloucestershire.</p> <p>The HSE report said there were \"no indications that Mr Hodder deliberately set out to pass signal 109 at red\", adding \"that any acts or omissions by him were just one group of contributory factors\".</p> <p>\"No faults were found,\" says the report. \"Had ATP been fitted and operational on the 165 [Mr Hodder's train] there would not have been a collision.\"</p> <p>The public inquiry had heard how Thames Trains management had refused to spend \u00a35.26 million on safety measures, including ATP, which would link a train's brakes automatically with the signals - even though its trains were designed and built for such use.</p> <p>Signal 109 had been passed at danger seven other times over five years and was among the 22 signals most passed at danger.

      "bodyText": "Signals in the area of the Paddington rail crash were \"exceptionally difficult\" for train drivers to read and did not comply with industry standards, the health and safety executive said yesterday. In its report into the October 1999 disaster the HSE said that the 31 people killed in the crash would not have died had automatic train protection been fitted to the Thames train which passed signal 109 at red. The findings back up earlier conclusions that a combination of dazzling sunshine, an inexperienced driver and a \"fundamentally flawed\" track layout caused the tragedy. It is thought that Michael Hodder, the driver of the Thames train, was deceived by a \"phantom aspect\" - a red light which appeared to be amber - before he crashed into the oncoming Great Western express. Experts who had looked at signals in the Paddington area, in particular signal 109, had concluded that \"the complexity of the layout and signal gantries, the range of approaches and the obscuration of the signal aspects by overhead line equipment present an exceptionally difficult signal reading task\", yesterday's HSE report concluded. It added that while the height of the signals on the gantry that carried signal 109 broadly met requirements \"many of the other signals in the Paddington area on the approach to signal 109 are at a height in excess of that permitted by Railway Group Standards - although when the signals were designed and installed, no maximum height was specified.\" Signals needed to be aligned to maximise their readability. This was particularly important on east-west lines such as those around Paddington where a low sun can come into play, the report added. The crash on October 5, 1999, left 31 people dead, including Mr Hodder, 31, who went through signal 109. His train, heading for Bedwyn in Wiltshire, travelled another 700 metres before colliding almost head-on at Ladbroke Grove with the Great Western train which had started out from Cheltenham Spa station in Gloucestershire. The HSE report said there were \"no indications that Mr Hodder deliberately set out to pass signal 109 at red\", adding \"that any acts or omissions by him were just one group of contributory factors\". \"No faults were found,\" says the report. \"Had ATP been fitted and operational on the 165 [Mr Hodder's train] there would not have been a collision.\" The public inquiry had heard how Thames Trains management had refused to spend \u00a35.26 million on safety measures, including ATP, which would link a train's brakes automatically with the signals - even though its trains were designed and built for such use. Signal 109 had been passed at danger seven other times over five years and was among the 22 signals most passed at danger. Mr Hodder was not an experienced driver, having only qualified 13 days before the accident. His competency certificate was issued following assessment of his route knowledge. This assessment did not involve questions about the Paddington-Ladbroke Grove section. The HSE report described how staff at the signal control centre in Slough, Berkshire, tried to prevent the crash once they realised a collision was imminent. An emergency stop message would have had to have been sent within 15 seconds and points would have had to be changed within about 12 seconds of the train going through the red signal. Even changing to danger the signal ahead of the Great Western train was \"ineffective\" as the GW train was going too fast to stop in time. The report criticised the lack of opportunities for signalling staff to practise their responses to signals passed at danger, for example by simulator training. Steve Walker, the HSE's assistant chief inspector of railways, later told a news conference that the HSE would make a decision early in the new year whether or not to instigate any legal proceedings under the Health and Safety at Work Act. He said signal 109 was still not in use and that Railtrack was looking at significant signalling changes in the area. Mick Rix, general secretary of the train drivers' union, Aslef, welcomed the HSE findings about the lack of proper train protection systems and poor signalling in the area. \"The industry should turn its attention to proper train protection and upgrade the infrastructure, rather than seeking to blame driver error for this terrible tragedy,\" he said. Yesterday's HSE report follows its three interim reports into the accident. It contained no recommendations. They will come when Lord Cullen produces his report after the public inquiry into the crash.",

Far easier to take refuge in the soft option rhetoric of law and order than to address, or even ask, the really tough questions thrown up by knifings in back alleys or boozing in the streets: questions about where the irresponsibility, amorality and sometimes chilling cruelty of young males actually comes from, what the factors are that help foster it, and how these aspects of our society can most effectively be challenged and changed.

We live in a world where the old models of manhood are increasingly redundant and look ever more absurd, yet the government seems almost as eager as the opposition to resurrect the notion that boys must be drilled, urged and cajoled back into masculine clothes which might have fitted their forefathers.</p> <p>Look more closely at the yob culture and what we see are young men not behaving simply badly, but in precisely the sorts of ways they hope will win them manhood's spurs. Just like the politicians they strut and they pose, frantically competing to be the most bellicose -who's got the most bottle, who will be the first to chuck a chair at the police? Look at boys in general, including those who are not yobs, and the same psychological dynamics dominate. As the shrewdest gender researchers have shown time and again, boys grow up policing themselves and one another with neurotic dedication, deriding and marginalising any human quality or perception within their own ranks that might be seen as - oh horror! - \"feminine\" and therefore \"gay\".</p> <p>The parallel with politicians holds damningly here too. Whether by design or habit, Hague has done his utmost to position himself as more of a man than Blair: the military haircut, the judo, the 14 pints of beer, the gritty \"commonsense\" revolt against the effete equivocations of the wine bar wimp. He's made himself look daft, of course, but Blair's edgy anyway. The distinctly mixed reception to his brief paternity leave showed what a risky business loosening the male straitjacket can be. The rules don't allow a man to be both nurturing and aggressive, caring and competitive, \"masculine\" and \"feminine\" at the same time. You can get hammered for it, mate: just look at the hatred that is heaped on David Beckham.</p> <p>Yet the hostile reactions triggered by such transgressions vividly expose the issues that must be raised if boys and young men are to be happier, and communities are to be spared their worst behaviour. We have to ask why there is such fierce resistance to a boy or man demonstrating a whole range of human qualities and aptitudes. We have to ask out loud why learning how to be \"masculine\" seems to mean almost nothing except being seen to triumph over \"feminine\" contamination.</p> <p>The answers to such questions do not lie with those plying tired, traditional answers. Nor do they lie in fatuous debates about the pros and cons of \"feminising\" men, the better to prepare them for the needs of modern industry. Rather, it's a case of acknowledging potential - the potential of any boy to be a rich and varied human being and granting him permission to explore it to the full.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",

Look more closely at the yob culture and what we see are young men not behaving simply badly, but in precisely the sorts of ways they hope will win them manhood's spurs. Just like the politicians they strut and they pose, frantically competing to be the most bellicose -who's got the most bottle, who will be the first to chuck a chair at the police? Look at boys in general, including those who are not yobs, and the same psychological dynamics dominate. As the shrewdest gender researchers have shown time and again, boys grow up policing themselves and one another with neurotic dedication, deriding and marginalising any human quality or perception within their own ranks that might be seen as - oh horror! - \"feminine\" and therefore \"gay\". The parallel with politicians holds damningly here too. Whether by design or habit, Hague has done his utmost to position himself as more of a man than Blair: the military haircut, the judo, the 14 pints of beer, the gritty \"commonsense\" revolt against the effete equivocations of the wine bar wimp. He's made himself look daft, of course, but Blair's edgy anyway. The distinctly mixed reception to his brief paternity leave showed what a risky business loosening the male straitjacket can be. The rules don't allow a man to be both nurturing and aggressive, caring and competitive, \"masculine\" and \"feminine\" at the same time. You can get hammered for it, mate: just look at the hatred that is heaped on David Beckham. Yet the hostile reactions triggered by such transgressions vividly expose the issues that must be raised if boys and young men are to be happier, and communities are to be spared their worst behaviour. We have to ask why there is such fierce resistance to a boy or man demonstrating a whole range of human qualities and aptitudes. We have to ask out loud why learning how to be \"masculine\" seems to mean almost nothing except being seen to triumph over \"feminine\" contamination. The answers to such questions do not lie with those plying tired, traditional answers. Nor do they lie in fatuous debates about the pros and cons of \"feminising\" men, the better to prepare them for the needs of modern industry. Rather, it's a case of acknowledging potential - the potential of any boy to be a rich and varied human being and granting him permission to explore it to the full. comment@theguardian.com",

On Saturday night rebels wearing military uniforms burst into a boys' dormitory at a technical college and opened fire, killing 15 students and a teacher, according to hospital staff. Guerrillas fighting for the creation of an Islamic state traditionally see the fasting month of Ramadan as the sacred period for their jihad (holy war), making it a tense and bloody time. Since Ramadan began three weeks ago about 200 rebels, government troops and civilians have been killed, according to media reports. The daily newspaper el Watan said a group of \"terrorists\" machine-gunned a bus carrying civilians, killing 15 and wounding several others, at a fake roadblock on Sunday night near the city of Tenes, 125 miles west of Algiers. An hour later five civilians, three of them women, were shot dead by rebels in Khemis Miliana, 75 miles west of Algiers. Breaking its customary silence on rebel violence, the official APS news agency reported the raid on the school in Medea, 55 miles south of Algiers, ending nearly two years of blackouts on security-related news in the state-controlled media. More than 100,000 people have been killed since early 1992 in the uprising, which began after the military-backed government cancelled a general election which Islamists were poised to win. Killings are reported almost daily, despite government peace efforts. Promising peace and reconciliation when he took office 18 months ago, President Abdelaziz Bouteflika offered an amnesty to militants not guilty of murder, bombings or rape. About 6,000 rebels took up the offer, but the more radical Islamic Armed Group (GIA) and Daawa al Djihad (Appeal and Struggle) vowed to continue fighting. About 4,000 armed rebels are active in small groups throughout the country, according to official estimates. \"The real danger lies in the fact that we see no concrete political or military strategy to fight terrorism,\" said Salima Tlemcani , an expert on security issues at el Watan. \"Where do the Algerian leaders want to lead this country?\" an editorial in the newspaper asked. \"Nobody seems moved by anything anymore, nobody reacts.

She lasted just 86 days in office before a military coup overthrew her government in the South African \"independent\" black homeland of Transkei.</p> <p>That was 13 years ago. Today Mrs Sigcau, who serves as minister of public works in President Thabo Mbeki's cabinet, is unusually quiet on the issue gripping South Africa: should whites apologise for apartheid?</p> <p>The question is more than academic to Mrs Sigcau, because some of those who oppose a new campaign to persuade whites to admit they benefited from racial oppression ask why only one group is being asked to sign the \"guilt list\".

      "bodyText": "Stella Sigcau does not like to be reminded of it, but she was Africa's first female prime minister. She lasted just 86 days in office before a military coup overthrew her government in the South African \"independent\" black homeland of Transkei. That was 13 years ago. Today Mrs Sigcau, who serves as minister of public works in President Thabo Mbeki's cabinet, is unusually quiet on the issue gripping South Africa: should whites apologise for apartheid? The question is more than academic to Mrs Sigcau, because some of those who oppose a new campaign to persuade whites to admit they benefited from racial oppression ask why only one group is being asked to sign the \"guilt list\". They argue that the system would not have proved as durable but for the collaboration of large numbers of black people. Many black South Africans worked for the apartheid police, army and civil service. Others served on the township councils, which were denounced and attacked by the African National Congress when it was underground. Poorer people often faced a nearly impossible choice between collaboration and destitution, and the point at which they contributed to their own oppression was not always clear. But there is no doubt that people such as Mrs Sigcau - who was once denounced in parliament as an \"apartheid spy\" - and other black people who served as homeland leaders, police chiefs and judges benefited from the oppression of their compatriots. Yet none of those who once served apartheid and now work for the ANC have seen fit to say sorry. They include the ANC premier of the corruption-plagued Mpumalanga province, Ndaweni Mahlangu, who previously served as deputy chief minister in the Kwa-Ndebele homeland. Among the ANC's members of parliament are mixed-race people who joined the racially segregated parliament under PW Botha, and former military officers from the black homelands. The ANC argues that there is no need for such people to apologise because its white opponents are using the issue to justify their own refusal to admit that they benefited from an evil system. Mrs Sigcau is a Pondo princess whose father, the late paramount chief Botha Sigcau, was the first president of Transkei after it was carved out as a corral for Xhosas by the white government. It was hardly a free country, being dependent on Pretoria for its entire budget as \"foreign aid\" and for the only recognition of its sovereignty other than by the other three \"independent\" homelands. Transkei's citizens scraped a living as best they could from the overpopulated and overworked land, but Mrs Sigcau did not suffer. She lasted less than three months as prime minister but, by her own admission, that was long enough for her to accept a hefty bribe from the hotel and casino magnate Sol Kerzner in return for gambling concessions. Mr Mbeki is said to keep Mrs Sigcau in his cabinet because her heritage gives her sway over Transkei's rural vote. The ANC's spokesman, Smuts Ngonyama, makes the previously unheard-of claim that Mrs Sigcau was really an ANC underground operative, even though she has been denounced in parliament as exactly the opposite. Her office says she has no comment. Mrs Sigcau was overthrown in 1987 by a bloodless coup by another apartheid servant who went on to prominence in the ANC. General Bantu Holomisa was five years as Transkei's military ruler for five years then, after joining the ANC, became a deputy minister in Nelson Mandela's government. He fell out with the party after publicly spilling the beans on Mrs Sigcau's bribe-taking. Gen Holomisa says he has nothing to apologise for. Others in Mr Mbeki's government have also refused to say sorry. The minister of home affairs and leader of Inkatha, Mangosuthu Buthelezi, ran the KwaZulu semi-autonomous homeland through the bloodiest years of his party's war with the ANC. He took secret money from the apartheid government to fund the conflict, and Inkatha collaborated with the security forces in murderous attacks on unarmed township residents in the ANC's heartlands. But he has repeatedly said that he has nothing to apologise for, and these days the ANC does not ask him to do so.",

      "body": "<p>The national exam results are just out and Stephen Rwamurangwa, headteacher of Kayonza modern secondary school, is pleased. His school, about two hours' drive east from the Rwandan capital, Kigali, has the best results of all the predominantly English-speaking schools in the country and is the 12th best overall. \"Generally I would say it's down to total teacher commitment,\" Rwamurangwa says. Across a table in his dark, cloakroom-sized office, he adds: \"I have tried to change the objectives of the school and its performance. I am proud that the school is small but it is among the best schools time and again. The students always feel they can perform better, they have confidence, they feel they can become successful.\" </p> <p>Many of Rwamurangwa's preoccupations are recognisably those of headteachers across the world: exam results, inspection, trying to meet the demands of the curriculum. The school motto is haranira kijijuka - \"struggle to achieve literacy\". Emmanuel Mudidi, the education minister, who knows the head, says he is doing well in an averagely resourced school. The government has given education a central role in its reconstruction. By 2020, ministers hope, everybody should be completing six years of primary school and three years of secondary school, following a modern curriculum taught by Rwandan-trained teachers. </p> <p>From classroom to state president to the international community - the UK is putting \u00a373m into Rwanda over three years, of which \u00a321m is earmarked for education - there is a remarkable degree of agreement about their goals. And it's good that there is, for right now the main thing, almost the only thing, Rwanda has going for it is ambition. </p> <p>This is the Rwanda where at least 800,000 and perhaps as many as 1m people, one-eighth of its population, were killed in the space of a few weeks in 1994; which ranks 164th of 174 countries on the UN human development index; where 50% of the population is illiterate; where only about two-thirds of children experience any time at all at primary school; where only one in five has any experience of secondary school. </p> <p>When the Hutu army and interahamwe militia began its slaughter of the minority Tutsi population and moderate Hutus, teachers - because they were community leaders, because they were educated - were often the first to die. Many Hutu teachers participated in the genocide, too. Illiteracy increased the potency of radio, the strongest media in the country, when inciters of the killings controlled the airwaves. </p> <p>The new government blames a lot on the old education system, which Mudidi says suffered from a \"colonial hangover\", separating a small percentage of the population, who were educated to run the country, from the masses. \"The consequence of such an education was the genocide of 1994,\" the government's education policy statement says baldly. And after the war, as long as the schools were closed, people refused to believe the war was over. \"We didn't have teachers, we didn't have schools. We went into prefectures and said, who can be the headmaster, who can be an inspector?\" says Narcisse Musabeyewo, the government's director of primary education. The way he tells it, as the schools resurfaced, so some kind of normality began to return. </p> <p>The genocide is a memory now, invisible and everywhere. It might be possible for a particularly ignorant tourist to visit Rwanda, a beautiful country crowded with subsistence farmers plundering postage stamp-sized fields, and not know there had been a genocide. But there are 125,000 people in prison on genocide charges; outside, there are people living side by side with men who killed their families. </p> <p>And in the schools, the government's policy of providing secondary education to all those whose parents died in the war means that in some, three-quarters of the students are genocide orphans; at Kayonza it's about half. </p> <p>Rwamurangwa's school has a rectangle of one-storey classrooms looking on to a grass yard with a Rwandan flag. He says, with a smile and a shrug: \"The problems are so many. The major one is simply that as a boarding school, we don't have electricity.\" And more: \"We don't have enough textbooks for the students. We don't have adequate laboratory equipment ... with the few books we have, sometimes an item is on the curriculum but we don't have the books to follow it.\" Of the 28 teachers at the school, just eight are trained. Most of the students in Kayonza board, either on site or in UN-built returnee huts. They are supposed to pay 7,000 Rwandan francs a term - about \u00a312 - and day pupils 5,766 per term. But only about 160 actually do. Those who can't pay stay on for as long as the school can cope. </p> <p>Genocide orphans are supposed to have their fees paid by a government fund. This fund has been badly managed - or, some say, exploited - and in several private schools, teachers who rely on money from the fund for their salaries have not been paid since the spring. Rwamurangwa earns 57,000 Rwandan francs a month, a bit more than \u00a390. Most primary teachers earn 23,000. At Kayonza, the school fees for orphans were not paid last term. </p> <p>This year, under pressure from the World Bank, which said there were too many - 30,000 - teachers on the government's books, the ministry of education has moved to prevent teachers working in more than one school. This got rid of some \"ghosts\"; but now many teachers do 30 hours of classroom teaching in the same place for half the money. </p> <p>Kayonza's 620 students divide roughly into one-third French-speaking, mostly Hutus; and two-thirds Anglophone, mostly Tutsis. But the government has abolished identification by tribe and has spent six years telling its population that they are Rwandan, and only Rwandan. All Rwandans speak the native language, Kinyarwanda, but the lessons at secondary level are mostly in either French or English. The new curriculum is a spliced-together version of the old Rwandan system and that taught in Anglophone east Africa, with the Francophone influence - chalk and talk - most pervasive. The government is trying to reform it, make it more skills-based, but for the moment it is still vast, complicated, traditional, outdated. </p> <p>Rwamurangwa takes me to watch Caleb Asiimwe teach a history class; they're studying 19th-century Prussian diplomacy. From a battered textbook, he gives dictation on the Schleswig-Holstein question. The students like this history, says Asiimwe later, they like the charac ters, the great men; outside the classroom, they call each other Bismarck and Metternich. </p> <p>But African history, especially Rwandan history, is mostly submerged. Partly this is practical - the teachers complain there are no up-to-date, reliable textbooks about Rwanda, and the government is still working out what to do about it. Partly it is emotional. \"They are telling us not to go deep,\" says John Mugisha, a history teacher at Fawe, a new, elite all-girls school in Gisozi. </p> <p>His headteacher, Emerithe Nzaramba, says: \"These children are still young. We try to talk about general subjects in our country but we don't go into details. We think we have to get some kind of counselling system before we go into talking about it. It's a bit artificial but we have to help them to live in the country.\" </p> <p>Next I take part in an English class run by Ryan O'Neill, 25, a Glaswegian working at Kayonza through Voluntary Service Overseas. Today his students practise asking questions, by asking me. The first question, from David Byabagamba, is: \"What will you tell people about what happened to our country in 1994?\" I ask them what I should tell people about Rwanda now. \"That we are united, one nation,\" says Irene Iribagiza, firmly and quietly. </p> <p>The teachers and students at Kayonza love Ryan. There's no literature at all in the English syllabus and if I'd not been there, he would have spent the lesson on gerunds. He is one of 54 VSO teachers in Rwanda. The organisation has been here now since 1999; a couple of volunteers have fled quickly, lonely and freaked out, but most have stayed, fallen for the country. </p> <p>\"I thought Kayonza was a dump when I first arrived,\" says Ryan, who shares a house with no running water with another VSO teacher, Denise Rawlinson. \"But I've grown to love the place.\" </p> <p>So does Christine Heap, 60, an RE teacher from Darlington now working in Byumba, one of the few volunteers with extensive experience. \"They want to learn: this is why I came into teaching. Anything you do is appreciated. That's such a big difference - a complete contrast to teaching at home.\" </p> <p>At Heap's school, I speak to a group of Francophone students learning to be primary teachers. They share a recognisable ambivalence about the prospect of a teaching career. \"I prefer to teach our children in Rwanda in order to make them intelligent, so they participate in the development of our country,\" says Jean Habakurama, 21. But he plans to apply for university, to study something else - he doesn't think teaching will pay enough. Likewise Evalde Nsengimana, 23: \"For me, as with my friends, I would prefer to teach two years and then go to university to improve my knowledge. We are not happy to be teachers only.\" </p> <p>Rwamurangwa is content to carry on in his school in Kayonza. \"If there is the ministerial suggestion for me to change to another school I cannot reject it, but I would rather stay here to see the school progressing,\" he says. </p> <p>Education in Rwanda, like living, is a continuing battle between hope and experience. The potential of people who have known the very worst confronts the realisation that so much has to be done to make things better. But there is something remarkable, perhaps deceptive, about the teachers and their students, so that in bare classrooms, as hardly trained staff teach excruciatingly old-fashioned syllabuses to classes of 60-plus, it is possible to believe that hope is winning.</p>",

The students always feel they can perform better, they have confidence, they feel they can become successful.\" Many of Rwamurangwa's preoccupations are recognisably those of headteachers across the world: exam results, inspection, trying to meet the demands of the curriculum. The school motto is haranira kijijuka - \"struggle to achieve literacy\". Emmanuel Mudidi, the education minister, who knows the head, says he is doing well in an averagely resourced school. The government has given education a central role in its reconstruction. By 2020, ministers hope, everybody should be completing six years of primary school and three years of secondary school, following a modern curriculum taught by Rwandan-trained teachers. From classroom to state president to the international community - the UK is putting \u00a373m into Rwanda over three years, of which \u00a321m is earmarked for education - there is a remarkable degree of agreement about their goals. And it's good that there is, for right now the main thing, almost the only thing, Rwanda has going for it is ambition. This is the Rwanda where at least 800,000 and perhaps as many as 1m people, one-eighth of its population, were killed in the space of a few weeks in 1994; which ranks 164th of 174 countries on the UN human development index; where 50% of the population is illiterate; where only about two-thirds of children experience any time at all at primary school; where only one in five has any experience of secondary school. When the Hutu army and interahamwe militia began its slaughter of the minority Tutsi population and moderate Hutus, teachers - because they were community leaders, because they were educated - were often the first to die. Many Hutu teachers participated in the genocide, too. Illiteracy increased the potency of radio, the strongest media in the country, when inciters of the killings controlled the airwaves. The new government blames a lot on the old education system, which Mudidi says suffered from a \"colonial hangover\", separating a small percentage of the population, who were educated to run the country, from the masses. \"The consequence of such an education was the genocide of 1994,\" the government's education policy statement says baldly. And after the war, as long as the schools were closed, people refused to believe the war was over. \"We didn't have teachers, we didn't have schools. We went into prefectures and said, who can be the headmaster, who can be an inspector?\" says Narcisse Musabeyewo, the government's director of primary education. The way he tells it, as the schools resurfaced, so some kind of normality began to return. The genocide is a memory now, invisible and everywhere. It might be possible for a particularly ignorant tourist to visit Rwanda, a beautiful country crowded with subsistence farmers plundering postage stamp-sized fields, and not know there had been a genocide. But there are 125,000 people in prison on genocide charges; outside, there are people living side by side with men who killed their families. And in the schools, the government's policy of providing secondary education to all those whose parents died in the war means that in some, three-quarters of the students are genocide orphans; at Kayonza it's about half. Rwamurangwa's school has a rectangle of one-storey classrooms looking on to a grass yard with a Rwandan flag. He says, with a smile and a shrug: \"The problems are so many. The major one is simply that as a boarding school, we don't have electricity.\" And more: \"We don't have enough textbooks for the students. We don't have adequate laboratory equipment ... with the few books we have, sometimes an item is on the curriculum but we don't have the books to follow it.\" Of the 28 teachers at the school, just eight are trained. Most of the students in Kayonza board, either on site or in UN-built returnee huts. They are supposed to pay 7,000 Rwandan francs a term - about \u00a312 - and day pupils 5,766 per term. But only about 160 actually do. Those who can't pay stay on for as long as the school can cope. Genocide orphans are supposed to have their fees paid by a government fund. This fund has been badly managed - or, some say, exploited - and in several private schools, teachers who rely on money from the fund for their salaries have not been paid since the spring. Rwamurangwa earns 57,000 Rwandan francs a month, a bit more than \u00a390. Most primary teachers earn 23,000. At Kayonza, the school fees for orphans were not paid last term. This year, under pressure from the World Bank, which said there were too many - 30,000 - teachers on the government's books, the ministry of education has moved to prevent teachers working in more than one school. This got rid of some \"ghosts\"; but now many teachers do 30 hours of classroom teaching in the same place for half the money. Kayonza's 620 students divide roughly into one-third French-speaking, mostly Hutus; and two-thirds Anglophone, mostly Tutsis. But the government has abolished identification by tribe and has spent six years telling its population that they are Rwandan, and only Rwandan. All Rwandans speak the native language, Kinyarwanda, but the lessons at secondary level are mostly in either French or English. The new curriculum is a spliced-together version of the old Rwandan system and that taught in Anglophone east Africa, with the Francophone influence - chalk and talk - most pervasive. The government is trying to reform it, make it more skills-based, but for the moment it is still vast, complicated, traditional, outdated. Rwamurangwa takes me to watch Caleb Asiimwe teach a history class; they're studying 19th-century Prussian diplomacy. From a battered textbook, he gives dictation on the Schleswig-Holstein question. The students like this history, says Asiimwe later, they like the charac ters, the great men; outside the classroom, they call each other Bismarck and Metternich. But African history, especially Rwandan history, is mostly submerged. Partly this is practical - the teachers complain there are no up-to-date, reliable textbooks about Rwanda, and the government is still working out what to do about it. Partly it is emotional. \"They are telling us not to go deep,\" says John Mugisha, a history teacher at Fawe, a new, elite all-girls school in Gisozi. His headteacher, Emerithe Nzaramba, says: \"These children are still young. We try to talk about general subjects in our country but we don't go into details. We think we have to get some kind of counselling system before we go into talking about it. It's a bit artificial but we have to help them to live in the country.\" Next I take part in an English class run by Ryan O'Neill, 25, a Glaswegian working at Kayonza through Voluntary Service Overseas. Today his students practise asking questions, by asking me. The first question, from David Byabagamba, is: \"What will you tell people about what happened to our country in 1994?\" I ask them what I should tell people about Rwanda now. \"That we are united, one nation,\" says Irene Iribagiza, firmly and quietly. The teachers and students at Kayonza love Ryan. There's no literature at all in the English syllabus and if I'd not been there, he would have spent the lesson on gerunds. He is one of 54 VSO teachers in Rwanda. The organisation has been here now since 1999; a couple of volunteers have fled quickly, lonely and freaked out, but most have stayed, fallen for the country. \"I thought Kayonza was a dump when I first arrived,\" says Ryan, who shares a house with no running water with another VSO teacher, Denise Rawlinson. \"But I've grown to love the place.\" So does Christine Heap, 60, an RE teacher from Darlington now working in Byumba, one of the few volunteers with extensive experience. \"They want to learn: this is why I came into teaching. Anything you do is appreciated. That's such a big difference - a complete contrast to teaching at home.\" At Heap's school, I speak to a group of Francophone students learning to be primary teachers. They share a recognisable ambivalence about the prospect of a teaching career. \"I prefer to teach our children in Rwanda in order to make them intelligent, so they participate in the development of our country,\" says Jean Habakurama, 21. But he plans to apply for university, to study something else - he doesn't think teaching will pay enough. Likewise Evalde Nsengimana, 23: \"For me, as with my friends, I would prefer to teach two years and then go to university to improve my knowledge. We are not happy to be teachers only.\" Rwamurangwa is content to carry on in his school in Kayonza. \"If there is the ministerial suggestion for me to change to another school I cannot reject it, but I would rather stay here to see the school progressing,\" he says. Education in Rwanda, like living, is a continuing battle between hope and experience. The potential of people who have known the very worst confronts the realisation that so much has to be done to make things better. But there is something remarkable, perhaps deceptive, about the teachers and their students, so that in bare classrooms, as hardly trained staff teach excruciatingly old-fashioned syllabuses to classes of 60-plus, it is possible to believe that hope is winning.",

The planning minister, Nick Raynsford, yesterday confirmed the decision to cut the number of new homes to be built each year from the original plan of 43,000 to 39,000 for the next five years. But he admitted that ministers had been unable to accept proposal by the South East Regional Planning Authority (Serplan) for a further reduction of 6,000, as this failed to take proper account of the region's future housing needs. He said that by concentrating on high-density housing developments, it would be possible to meet the new target without using any more land than Serplan had envisaged would be needed for 33,000 new homes per year. The announcement was given a cool reception by environmental groups and the opposition, who argued that the new target figure was an inadequate response to the threat development poses to the region's green spaces. The shadow environment secretary, Archie Norman, accused ministers of arrogantly assuming that they knew better than Serplan what the region needed. \"This is a slap in the face for local people.

Unfortunately, the admirable Save Our Railways was wound down when renation alisation no longer looked viable and when rail unions withdrew their funding. Now, ironically, these unions are beginning to campaign again themselves. Return The Tracks is a joint union initiative to bring back engineering and maintenance functions into Railtrack - a preliminary to making the whole railway system publicly accountable. The RMT rail union, already committed to railway renationalisation, is planning campaigns for the new year.</p> <p>This is important. It was tragic that privatisation destroyed the public service ethos among workers. British Rail had terrible faults but at least its employees regarded themselves as running a service. Since privatisation, many employees have become income-enforcers, which some have carried out extremely unpleasantly. The recent case of compensation for a traveller detained in a head-lock when trying to run for a train was extreme but not untypical. Such attitudes come from top down, but they have to change from bottom up.</p> <p>The structure of the railway is now so complicated, any campaign would have its work cut out. But some form of renationalisation of Railtrack is still the most obvious and most vital demand. In the words of Jonathan Bray, ex-chair of Save Our Railways, this would \"unlock everything else\" and intro duce much needed stability. \"It would allow for integration of various policies and it would enable control of engineering functions at a senior level. It would also remove it from the 'city casino' where shares rise and fall over perceived 'impositions' of the rail regulator.\"</p> <p>The pressures that led to rail expansion before Hatfield are still there, as are the same absolutely sound environmental reasons. So saving the railways is not something merely affecting a few unfortunate commuters.</p> <p>The government has committed \u00a330bn of public money to the railways over the next 10 years, but to throw such money into the current chaos would be obscene. The public has every right to demand the government will take proper control.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:ros@roscoward.demon.co.uk\">ros@roscoward.demon.co.uk</a></p>",

But there's growing evi dence the unthinkable is now being thought. A compromise on the tube looks possible. The select committee on transport pulled no punches about Railtrack's dismal failures. An early day motion on renationalising Railtrack already has more than 70 Labour supporters. Rumours indicate that Tony Blair himself has finally recognised the extent of the railways' problems. It is beginning to sink in that this industry could go on screwing up forever, and the damage to the environment, to business, to people's lives and to the government's reputation will be cataclysmic. What's needed urgently is a public campaign to exploit this political vulnerability. Unfortunately, the admirable Save Our Railways was wound down when renation alisation no longer looked viable and when rail unions withdrew their funding. Now, ironically, these unions are beginning to campaign again themselves. Return The Tracks is a joint union initiative to bring back engineering and maintenance functions into Railtrack - a preliminary to making the whole railway system publicly accountable. The RMT rail union, already committed to railway renationalisation, is planning campaigns for the new year. This is important. It was tragic that privatisation destroyed the public service ethos among workers. British Rail had terrible faults but at least its employees regarded themselves as running a service. Since privatisation, many employees have become income-enforcers, which some have carried out extremely unpleasantly. The recent case of compensation for a traveller detained in a head-lock when trying to run for a train was extreme but not untypical. Such attitudes come from top down, but they have to change from bottom up. The structure of the railway is now so complicated, any campaign would have its work cut out. But some form of renationalisation of Railtrack is still the most obvious and most vital demand. In the words of Jonathan Bray, ex-chair of Save Our Railways, this would \"unlock everything else\" and intro duce much needed stability. \"It would allow for integration of various policies and it would enable control of engineering functions at a senior level. It would also remove it from the 'city casino' where shares rise and fall over perceived 'impositions' of the rail regulator.\" The pressures that led to rail expansion before Hatfield are still there, as are the same absolutely sound environmental reasons. So saving the railways is not something merely affecting a few unfortunate commuters. The government has committed \u00a330bn of public money to the railways over the next 10 years, but to throw such money into the current chaos would be obscene. The public has every right to demand the government will take proper control. ros@roscoward.demon.co.uk",

      "bodyText": "The United Nations appears to have lost control of a key part of northern Kosovo after a weekend of violence in which a Serb man was shot dead by Belgian peacekeeping troops. The UN Mission in Kosovo has ordered its international and locally recruited police service and all UN personnel to withdraw from the town of Leposavic. Late yesterday afternoon the town and surrounding villages had no international presence - troops from the Nato-led peacekeeping force, K-For, had been confined to barracks. An improvised roadblock of logs had been erected by locals outside the town's UN police station. Responsibility for the enforcement of law and order appeared to have been assumed by local Serbs. Serbian parliamentary elections are due throughout Serbia - including Kosovo - on Saturday. The UN staff were pulled out after Milan Jokovic, 20, was shot outside the police station late on Saturday as a crowd of 200 people surrounded the building. Soldiers used teargas and fired warning shots in attempt to disperse the crowd. A Belgian officer admitted on Sunday that Jokovic had been struck by a bullet which ricocheted off a wall. K-For officials now say they do not know who fired shot. Earlier on Saturday six Belgian soldiers and a civilian had been seized by the crowd and held hostage. Two guns and 150 rounds of ammunition were stolen in the process. The hostages were released three hours later, after negotiations with a senior Belgian officer. UN officials say the violence was sparked off by the arrest of a Serb man for reckless driving. Jokovic's funeral, on a hilltop three miles to the south of Leposavic, was attended by more than 500 people. A trailer towed by a mechanised plough carried his coffin between the trees and funeral plots marked by Orthodox crosses and the Serbian flags. The presence of four foreign journalists attracted the attention of a stout man, dressed in a black leather jacket. As we moved away from the cemetery he demanded to see identity cards. An American photographer working for the Liaison photo agency saw the man move a pistol to his pocket. He then produced what appeared to be a police badge. \"This is a people's revolution,\" he explained as he demanded the right to see our papers. \"This is Serbia, not Kosovo.

He said the victim of the shooting was the son of a fellow policemen. \"If it happened to him it could happen to my son\". He eventually let us go after two of us produced out-of-date Serbian press accreditation. A senior British UN official based in nearby Mitrovice said later that dozens of policemen were believed to be employed in the region, paid by Serbian government officials north of the border.

A UN spokesman, Frank Benjaminson, denied that the UN had lost control of the area. \"We will return them [the UN police and staff] as soon as possible. We still have K-For in the area, even though you can't see them,\" he said. South of Leposavic, on the road to Mitrovice, a check point previously manned by Belgian soldiers was guarded by Greek troops, who are seen by the Serb community as more sympathetic. In the south of the province K-For was coming under increased pressure after an attack on a joint Russian and American patrol on the boundary with Serbia. The shooting followed the destruction by the troops of a road believed to have been used by Albanian guerrillas for smuggling arms and men into Serbia. The troops returned fire and then retreated. There were no casualties. It is not clear who fired the shots, though K-For officials suspect the rebel group of ethnic Albanians fighting for the independence of three Albanian municipalities in Serbia and their attachment to Kosovo.",

      "bodyText": "George W Bush sought to enlist the support of the financial world's most powerful individual yesterday when he met the US central banker Alan Greenspan, in Washington. Political analysts believe that a nod from Mr Greenspan, the respected chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, would help Mr Bush to find support for his unloved $1,300bn (\u00a3800m) tax-cutting package. Mr Bush said after the hour-long breakfast meeting: \"I talked with a good man right here. We had a very strong discussion about my confidence in his abilities.\" A taciturn Mr Greenspan was guided by the president-elect's hand on his shoulder in a public appearance designed to draw a veil over the rancour that existed between the banker and George Bush Sr's administration. Mr Bush made it clear that he wanted to convince Mr Greenspan that he needed to cut taxes to head off a recession. But he faces an uphill struggle to win acceptance of the plan in Washington, where even senior Republicans have voiced concern about its impact on the economy. Democrats have criticised it for favouring the wealthy. Yesterday George W Bush said: \"There's going to be a lot of discussion, a lot of head-knocking ... and arm twisting.\" He may also find it difficult to get Mr Greenspan on his side. Before the election, the Fed chairman made it clear that tax cuts were a lowly second choice to paying back the US government debt. But if the economy continues to slow down, the Federal Reserve could start to soften its anti-inflationary stance as soon as today. If that happens, some economists believe Mr Greenspan could make a U-turn on taxes early next year.

Hunts exist for hunters, not for farmers whose land they cross, and certainly not for the welfare of the hunted.</p> <p>Some argue in favour of boxing and hunting on libertarian grounds: that those who engage in them do so freely and without affecting the rights of others. The argument is unconvincing. A fox is a living thing with the right to a humane death: if hunting is acceptable, why not badger baiting and cock fighting? And if boxers are free to maim and kill each other, why not permit so-called total fighting, in which there are no restraints, or bring back gladiators? There would certainly be an audience.</p> <p>I have hunted and boxed, and feel ambiguous about both. They are fascinating, inward-looking worlds full of courageous individuals with a deep love of what they do. They have rich, superbly documented traditions; to lose either would be like losing a language - an accumulation of meanings that offer an insight into human behaviour. I think of the old master of foxhounds I rode with who had no interest in being up with the thrusters to witness the kill, but wanted to watch the hounds working and listen to them calling to each other as they trawled through a copse. I think, too, of the former boxer damaged by too many hard fights but still anxious to box because only in the ring could he truly express himself.</p> <p>The only argument for boxing, as for hunting, is aesthetic (jarring though the word is, as a boxer lies fighting for his life in a Sheffield hospital). Not in the sense of beauty, though many would claim that boxing - the \"sweet science\" - is beautiful when a Muhammad Ali or a Sugar Ray Leonard is performing; and some would even make the same claim for hunting when the hunt gathers in the frosty light of a crisp December day.</p> <p>Boxing and hunting are worlds entire unto themselves: ban them and you eliminate a way of being. That is why hunting, feeling itself hunted, has responded so ferociously: it is not a sport under attack but a way of life.

The fact that boxing and hunting have inspired great writing does not mean either is great, but should make us aware that in banning them we would be losing something profound.</p> <p>Boxing and hunting have no place in a rational world, but do we live in a rational world?

      "body": "<p>It being Christmas, I am going to say something nice about the ludicrous dolts who control Britain's railways. For in the past few years - and the past few weeks especially - they have achieved something that has eluded successive governments for generations: they have addressed Britain's most intractable structural problem: its metrocentricity.</p> <p>London has been sucking the life out of provincial cities ever since the railways were invented, and probably since Saxon times. The problem grew so bad that earlier this year one of the country's most compelling and influential columnists suggested moving the political capital somewhere else: to York, Chester, Crewe or to the geographical centre of Britain, Hawes in Wensleydale. Thus began an intense national debate ... well, a late-night phone-in on Radio Stoke, anyway; the moment passed quietly in Hawes because both Guardian readers were away.</p> <p>The idea, however, was predicated on the existence of reasonable transport links, which seems very far-fetched in a Christmas week when travel is more difficult than in any year since the 1940s, if not the 1840s. The other cities of Britain have been bedevilled because it has always seemed so simple to go to London. All that's gone.</p> <p>To some extent this fits in with a trend that was noticeable through the 1990s: provincial chic. The great regional centres are much more highly regarded than they were in the Thatcher years. This is partly because of the growth in student numbers and the attendant youth culture and clubbing, which have created a sense of life on the streets. It's partly to do with the fashion for football, in which London is second-best. It's partly political: local councils have become much more adept at marketing their cities and buffing up their image. Newcastle now is widely perceived as cool rather than cold; Leeds is meant to be Dallas; Birmingham is definitely one of the most exciting and hippest places in the whole West Midlands (sorry, couldn't resist it); even Bolton talks of being a 24-hour metropolis.</p> <p>And in the toyshops this Christmas there is a plastic-and-cardboard manifestation of this rediscovered self confidence: provincial variants of Monopoly. There are now a dozen versions of British regions and cities apart from London. The makers claim demand is \"phenomenal\".</p> <p>Now Monopoly is a prince among board games, being both complex and divisive - responsible, I would guess, for more broken marriages than adultery and only slightly fewer than contract bridge. Originally, of course, it was American and based on the streets of Atlantic City.</p> <p>But the London version has seared itself into our consciousness because it has the added British ingredient: class. It is understood that the brown properties are cheap because they are working-class, and that the purples are expensive because they are aspirational (even if, in reality, Park Lane is clogged with traffic and Mayfair full of tarts).</p> <p>This is much harder to achieve outside London. Part of the metrocentricity problem is that the averagely well educated person in, say, Newcastle, could easily name dozens of London streets but not one in Bristol or Birmingham. Unfortunately, the new Monopolies will not address this: Bristol Monopoly is not on sale in Newcastle and vice versa. Also, the designers have backed away from replicating the intricate gradations of status inherent in the traditional version. The squares are sponsored, and the colours represent different business groupings rather than geography: the pinky set is sporting, for instance, and the browns represent \"service industries\". Far from being inherently undesirable, sponsors are said to be doubly keen on getting brown because the design of the box-top gives them an extra mention. In Mancunian Monopoly, St Peter's Square is brown and St Ann's Square purple, but these certainly do not represent the extremes of local class consciousness.</p> <p>Some of the streets are less than catchy and some are not even streets. Can you really imagine building a hotel (Welsh version, orange set) on Vale Road, Llandudno Junction? Or (Ulster version, purple) on Giant's Causeway? Wouldn't that lead to problems with planning? And what about (Edinburgh version, green) the Scottish parliament, priced at \u00a3320 in the place usually allocated to Bond Street? To be realistic, that figure should double about every fortnight.</p> <p>All of this seems very commendable since, for most Britons, London is so distant this Christmas. These games are even educational: I can reveal that Cist y gymun is the Welsh for Community Chest. Whether they will catch on is another matter: I suspect, deep in our psyche, we need something that has the spice of class distinction. It's part of being British. Have a sweet-tempered Christmas, especially if playing Monopoly - or travelling by train.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:&quot;matthewengel@ndirect.co.uk&quot;\">matthewengel@ndirect.co.uk</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "It being Christmas, I am going to say something nice about the ludicrous dolts who control Britain's railways. For in the past few years - and the past few weeks especially - they have achieved something that has eluded successive governments for generations: they have addressed Britain's most intractable structural problem: its metrocentricity. London has been sucking the life out of provincial cities ever since the railways were invented, and probably since Saxon times. The problem grew so bad that earlier this year one of the country's most compelling and influential columnists suggested moving the political capital somewhere else: to York, Chester, Crewe or to the geographical centre of Britain, Hawes in Wensleydale. Thus began an intense national debate ... well, a late-night phone-in on Radio Stoke, anyway; the moment passed quietly in Hawes because both Guardian readers were away. The idea, however, was predicated on the existence of reasonable transport links, which seems very far-fetched in a Christmas week when travel is more difficult than in any year since the 1940s, if not the 1840s. The other cities of Britain have been bedevilled because it has always seemed so simple to go to London. All that's gone. To some extent this fits in with a trend that was noticeable through the 1990s: provincial chic. The great regional centres are much more highly regarded than they were in the Thatcher years. This is partly because of the growth in student numbers and the attendant youth culture and clubbing, which have created a sense of life on the streets. It's partly to do with the fashion for football, in which London is second-best. It's partly political: local councils have become much more adept at marketing their cities and buffing up their image. Newcastle now is widely perceived as cool rather than cold; Leeds is meant to be Dallas; Birmingham is definitely one of the most exciting and hippest places in the whole West Midlands (sorry, couldn't resist it); even Bolton talks of being a 24-hour metropolis. And in the toyshops this Christmas there is a plastic-and-cardboard manifestation of this rediscovered self confidence: provincial variants of Monopoly. There are now a dozen versions of British regions and cities apart from London. The makers claim demand is \"phenomenal\". Now Monopoly is a prince among board games, being both complex and divisive - responsible, I would guess, for more broken marriages than adultery and only slightly fewer than contract bridge. Originally, of course, it was American and based on the streets of Atlantic City. But the London version has seared itself into our consciousness because it has the added British ingredient: class. It is understood that the brown properties are cheap because they are working-class, and that the purples are expensive because they are aspirational (even if, in reality, Park Lane is clogged with traffic and Mayfair full of tarts). This is much harder to achieve outside London. Part of the metrocentricity problem is that the averagely well educated person in, say, Newcastle, could easily name dozens of London streets but not one in Bristol or Birmingham. Unfortunately, the new Monopolies will not address this: Bristol Monopoly is not on sale in Newcastle and vice versa. Also, the designers have backed away from replicating the intricate gradations of status inherent in the traditional version. The squares are sponsored, and the colours represent different business groupings rather than geography: the pinky set is sporting, for instance, and the browns represent \"service industries\". Far from being inherently undesirable, sponsors are said to be doubly keen on getting brown because the design of the box-top gives them an extra mention. In Mancunian Monopoly, St Peter's Square is brown and St Ann's Square purple, but these certainly do not represent the extremes of local class consciousness. Some of the streets are less than catchy and some are not even streets. Can you really imagine building a hotel (Welsh version, orange set) on Vale Road, Llandudno Junction? Or (Ulster version, purple) on Giant's Causeway? Wouldn't that lead to problems with planning? And what about (Edinburgh version, green) the Scottish parliament, priced at \u00a3320 in the place usually allocated to Bond Street? To be realistic, that figure should double about every fortnight. All of this seems very commendable since, for most Britons, London is so distant this Christmas. These games are even educational: I can reveal that Cist y gymun is the Welsh for Community Chest. Whether they will catch on is another matter: I suspect, deep in our psyche, we need something that has the spice of class distinction. It's part of being British. Have a sweet-tempered Christmas, especially if playing Monopoly - or travelling by train. matthewengel@ndirect.co.uk",

That's Thin Lizzy, whose leather-trousered lead singer Phil Lynott, the unmistakable face of the band, passed away nearly 15 years ago. Thin Lizzy without Lynott might seem unthinkable, but this is just one in a surprisingly long line of bands that have survived - and even prospered - without their most influential member. </p> <p>Van Halen's career was scarcely troubled when \"face of Van Halen\" David Lee Roth was replaced by the less pretty phizog of Sammy Hagar. The same applies to the Spice Girls after they lost Geri Halliwell in 1998. Then there's the Manic Street Preachers since the disappearance of lyricist Richey Edwards; Fleetwood Mac without genius founder Peter Green; and AC/DC after the death of singer Bon Scott. Even the Beatles recorded a number one (Real Love) minus John's physical presence. </p> <p>The few bands that have flopped disastrously after a key member upped and left (Ultravox minus Midge Ure, the Stone Roses after John Squire) don't seem to disprove the trend. It's not the band that people want - it's the brand name. </p> <p>The classic example of this phenomenon is Pink Floyd. They have survived the departure of not one but two principal members, Roger Waters and Syd Barratt, which their original manager, Peter Jenner, describes as \"like the Rolling Stones losing Mick Jagger, twice\". </p> <p>Up to and including 1967's debut album The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, Pink Floyd were fronted by Barratt. He was the good-looking one with the curly hair who nowadays lives as a recluse with his mum in Cambridge. Back then, his behaviour was unbecoming even for a rock star. He took lots of LSD. He greeted a live TV interviewer with a blank stare. Most famously, he freaked out onstage, thinking that his head was melting (it was in fact a combination of hairwax and Mandrax tablets he'd concocted as a pomade, which dissolved under the lights). </p> <p>Unsurprisingly, the Floyd decided that continuing to work with Barratt was impossible - a particular problem given that he wrote and sang all their songs. But David Gilmour came in on guitar, the rejigged line-up came up with Dark Side of the Moon, and the rest is history. In 1983, when main singer-songwriter Roger Waters left the band, they simply carried on without him. Waters, who had penned most of their 1970s classics, including The Wall, expected Pink Floyd to flounder in his absence. Instead, they played his songs to millions and watched as the solo Waters sank into the Where Are They Now? files. </p> <p>It undoubtedly helped that Pink Floyd have always been a fairly anonymous, mysterious proposition, playing in the dark or beneath huge lightshows. But, crucially, neither Barratt nor Waters proved bigger than the band - or the brand. </p> <p>Jenner recalls a meeting the band had with their booking agent. \"I think that was one of their great moves,\" he says. \"It was explained to them that they had a very valuable brand name already. They'd established a presence in the market. But at the time, those concepts weren't in mine or the band's vocabulary.\" Indeed, Jenner quit, convinced that Pink Floyd couldn't continue without Barratt. </p> <p>Today a band become a brand as soon as it enters the marketplace, and even something as apparently disastrous as the loss of a lead singer can be turned into a marketing opportunity. When Geri left the Spice Girls, a clever spin operation whirred into action. Crucially, Geri had not informed the others that she was leaving. \"It looked like she'd let the other four down,\" explains a source in the Spice Girls camp who prefers not to be named. \"That's why they got such support, even when the media thought they were finished and the knives were out for them.\" </p> <p>The Spice brand proved bigger than Geri, with Sporty, Baby, Scary and Posh strong enough characters in their own right to front it out. Of course, it helped that the music wasn't affected: the Spice Girls scarcely wrote their own hits, and though Geri had been the PR face of the band, her singing role was minor. \"It would've been much worse if Mel C had left,\" says our source. The publicity over Geri's exit didn't hurt, either. Spice album sales rose by 20%. </p> <p>A band member, no matter how talented he or she is, underestimates the importance of brand name at their peril. In fact, industry figures maintain that the average consumer has no idea who is actually in their favourite combo. </p> <p>\"When I tell people 'I managed the Floyd when Syd was in them', they go 'Oh, what was that? Dark Side of the Moon?' \"Jenner says with a laugh. \"And these are people who are massively interested in the Floyd in a 'my favourite band' sort of way.\" </p> <p>Similarly, very few of the AC/DC fans who packed their recent UK arena tour probably know or even care that Bon Scott, rather than post-1980 incumbent Brian Johnson, sang on their pivotal early albums. </p> <p>This explains the failure of many solo projects. Albums by Dave Gilmour, Richard Ashcroft and even Mick Jagger (1985's disastrous She's the Boss) shifted a fraction of the units generated by their bands. These artists could have made the same record, stuck the name the Verve or the Stones on it, and sold truckloads. </p> <p>In the end, though, a pop brand name works in the same way as any other. If Heinz were suddenly to start making awful baked beans, people would stop buying them. Likewise, a pop band still has to deliver the goods. As a group gathers its own history, the \"legendary\" name becomes even more significant. </p> <p>Take the sudden collapse of Genesis. In 1975 they pulled off the coup of replacing the theatrical Peter Gabriel with Phil Collins - hardly a flamboyant figure. The fans accepted the change (it helped that Collins was promoted from within) and, to their credit, Genesis were able to forge a new musical identity. However, when Collins himself left 22 years later, he was replaced as frontman by Ray Wilson, of one-hit jeans advert wonders Stiltskin. One solitary album with this line-up, and the band folded - after 30 years. </p> <p>The live set may have included old songs, but fans were unable to accept that this was still Genesis. Still, at least they didn't descend into the chicken-in-a-basket circuit hell of, say, the Drifters, in their various reincarnations, or the Wilson-less karaoke horror that now masquerades as the Beach Boys. </p> <p>\"The art is satisfying people's conception of the band,\" says Peter Jenner. \"You mustn't deny what the old band has done - that is really bad news.

Norway had offered to host the meeting to enable the two sides to patch up the differences which sank the UN Hague conference on cutting greenhouse gases last month. The US said it would not go to Norway if a successful outcome was unlikely. There is a wide gap between the EU and the US-led \"umbrella group\" on how to implement the 1997 UN agreement on cutting the pollution blamed for global warming. The big stumbling blocks are the US wish to count the carbon stored in its forests and farmlands against its emissions-reduction target and the EU's insistence on limiting the use of \"flexible mechanisms\" such as buying emissions credits from other countries. Since the failure in the Hague, the two parties have been trying desperately to patch up an agreement. Both wanted to reach a deal before George Bush's Republican administration, which is considered hostile to the agreement, is sworn in at the end of January. The French spokeswoman said the lack of a meeting in Oslo did not mean there was no chance of a deal in the medium term as the parties would meet at a UN environment programme summit in Nairobi in January. Reuters, Brussels Second BSE case found in Germany Germany has announced plans to destroy a herd of 82 cattle today, after its second case of BSE was confirmed in a cow recently slaughtered in southern Bavaria. Two other suspected cases were found in northern Bavaria at the weekend. The federal institute for virus research in T\u00fcbingen said the herd on a farm near Sulzberg in southern Bavaria was tested last week under the government's decision, after the first case, to enforce mandatory testing for all cattle aged over 30 months. \"We believe that the animal was infected three years ago after being fed contaminated fodder,\" a state agricultural spokesman said.

Reuters, Abidjan Schr\u00f6der condition on EU entry Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der proposed yesterday that eastern European workers should be denied free movement in member states for up to seven years after their countries join the EU. The German leader was speaking in northern Bavaria, attempting to allay fears of an influx of cheap labour from Poland and the Czech Republic when the EU is expanded. \"If we were to allow complete and immediate freedom of movement for workers after enlargement we would be confronted with a strong influx into Germany,\" he said. \"Sections of our employment market would not be able to cope with this.\" He said his proposal would be put to member states and the commissioner for enlargement, G\u00fcnter Verheugen, next year.

      "body": "<p>From the Tannoy of Finsbury Park station comes a familiar message. The 8.33pm to Hertford North has been cancelled. The three middle-aged men, accompanied by one young boy, have an hour to kill and there is only one thing for it. \"Let's go to the pub,\" says one. \"These bloody trains will drive you to drink.\" They will also drive you with drink.</p> <p>The majority of those who board the next train are carrying bottles of beer. About a quarter of the carriage is drunk. When we arrive at Stevenage the walkway between the town centre and the leisure park, a thoroughfare between town and clubland, teenage boys clutch pints of lager as though they were tickets to manhood.</p> <p>It's Saturday night and you can almost hear the drum beats of a primal British ritual pounding. It's time for the smallest market town and the largest urban centre to bury their differences in a sea of beer and Bacardi Breezers. By the end of the night, young women with glazed eyes will link arms and sing anything from Frank Sinatra to The Wizard of Oz; young men will support themselves against the nearest immovable object and then urinate on it. It's Saturday night: time to \"get hammered\", \"blasted\" and \"go mad for it\". It's time, in short, for alcohol to take over.</p> <p>\"British social culture is built around drink,\" says Eric Appleby of Alcohol Concern. \"If you're going to meet people after work you meet them in a pub. If you're going out for a chat you'll go to a pub and in the pub there is a macho thing about how many drinks you've had. Drinking alcohol then becomes the primary social activity.\"</p> <p>So while the social scenes of most American sitcoms, such as Seinfeld, Friends or Frasier, take place in coffee bars and diners, all English soap characters like to mull over their problems at the Woolpack, the Rovers Return or the Queen Vic. If Jim Davidson, the comedian and Tory MC, wants to impress his colleague and co-star, the TV presenter Suzi Perry, he falls off the wagon and drinks himself silly. \"As soon as I saw her I fell in love with her,\" he said. \"I decided I'd try everything I could to pull her. I started cracking open the champagne, fell into a bottle and stayed there. I was absolutely smashed. I woke up the next morning with my first hangover since 1994.\"</p> <p>And, being a dominant factor in our social culture, alcohol is increasingly becoming a major issue in our political culture. When the leader of the opposition wants to look like a man of the people, he recalls his days drinking 14 pints as a teenager and the 32 rum and blacks he claims he downed on his 18th birthday.</p> <p>When the prime minister is looking for the central theme of what will almost certainly be the final parliamentary session, he reaches for the bottle and declares war on \"yob culture\". When his son, Euan, was found inebriated in Leicester Square it was not just a blow to him as a father but a political embarrassment to the head of a government that had just proposed spot fines for those found drunk in public.</p> <p>Back in Stevenage a young woman, in a short skirt despite the bitter cold, stands outside the Pulse nightclub with her head in a bin. While one friend puts a coat over her back so that no one can see her knickers, the other holds her hair out of her face as she retches. A sight so common that no one is watching.</p> <p>Inside the Vogue nightclub next door, Peter and Dave have been drinking since lunchtime. Peter, 35, has custody of his two children every other weekend. On his weekends off he \"goes out and gets smashed\". Dave runs out of fingers and moves on to his toes as he counts how many drinks he has had that day and then laughs a cheery, leery, glazed laugh, while expressing amazement that they're still standing.</p> <p>By the time the night is over the car park will be spattered with vomit. A young man staggers dangerously and aimlessly down a main road shouting: \"I'm a he man.\" Another, perched precariously against a burger van, yells: \"You're a cunt.\"</p> <p>Britain has a drink problem. We drink almost two-thirds more alcohol per person today than we did in 1965. More than 9m adults drink at levels that endanger their long-term health, and more than one in 25 of us is alcohol-dependent. While it is an issue affecting the whole country, some places and people are in more trouble than others. The proportion of women drinking over the limit rose by 55% between 1984 to 1996. Glasgow is facing the worst incidence of alcohol abuse for 80 years. Most vulnerable are the young - a third of young men live on \"beer and fast food\"; a quarter of 16- to 19-year-olds in greater Glasgow get drunk at least once a week.</p> <p>It has cast a serious pall over the way other countries see us. According to a British Council report recently, those aged between 24 and 40 around the world regard Britons as \"violent, xenophobic and frequently drunk\".</p> <p>And it is costing us dearly. Not just in human terms - 28,000 deaths a year are alcohol-related - but economically. Every year alcohol costs the NHS around \u00a3150m, industry an estimated \u00a32bn and the government roughly \u00a3150m, according to Alcohol Concern.</p> <p>But, curiously, it is not the amount we drink that marks us out as a nation. Even though we drink considerably more than we used to, we still drink a lot less than most other European Union countries. That is particularly true of France and Germany, where Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der recently made it to number two in the music charts when a DJ put music to a recording of him saying: \"Get me a bottle of beer or I'm going to go on strike here.\" With the exception of Finland and Sweden - where, like here, they binge drink - no other EU country drinks less than Britain.</p> <p>This is borne out in other areas. Britons are far less likely to die from cirrhosis of the liver than citizens of any other EU country with the exception of the Irish and the Dutch. The incidence of road traffic accidents involving alcohol is also substantially lower than the EU average.</p> <p>Our drinking habits have also changed quite radically. Europe has traditionally been split up into drinking cultures determined principally by climate. Colder, northern countries (the UK, Germany, Austria) are beer-drinking cultures, while warmer, southern nations (Italy, France, Spain) drink wine. Now those habits are converging. The proportion of beer in our national alcohol intake has dropped by a quarter, while wine has more than doubled.</p> <p>So if we drink less than most other European countries and are increasingly drinking the same kind of things, why does a Saturday night out in Lisbon, Barcelona or Lyon never have quite the same chaotic, threatening feel as London, Birmingham or Liverpool?</p> <p>The problem, say experts, is the way that we drink. \"In most other countries they drink with food or as part of some other social activity,\" says Appleby. \"Here we mainly drink to drink and quite often to get drunk. The particular thing about British drinking culture is that it is associated with aggression.\"</p> <p>\"The problems in Europe relating to alcohol are largely medical whereas in Britain they are about disorder,\" says professor Nick Heather, who is the director of the centre of alcohol and drug studies in Newcastle. \"They may drink more on the continent but they drink consistently and regularly whereas we drink in short bursts.\"</p> <p>The reason for this cannot be found in the British psyche but in the history of our licensing laws and cultural make-up, argues Dr Paul Davis, a consultant clinical psychologist who specialises in addictive behaviour. \"Until the very end of the 20th century, the law squashed the hours when we could drink into a relatively small space of time so we learned to drink quickly and in quite a focused way,\" says Davis, who believes bingeing has been a key element in British drinking culture since before the Victorian era.</p> <p>\"And because we drink as a separate activity, away not just from food but from children, our drinking habits are not regulated by other social norms, which makes deviant behaviour far more likely.\" The situation in Scotland, which has enjoyed more relaxed laws for far longer but has more acute problems than the rest of the UK, is underpinned by different historical and cultural factors, he says.</p> <p>Whatever the reasons, the consequences are there for all to see every weekend on almost every high street in Britain. As such, it marks an ideal point for Blairite intervention - a place where individual rights meet societal responsibilities without the encumbrance of ideology. A populist issue where the boundaries between private and public are necessarily blurred. A problem that appears to demand New Labour's increasingly familiar strain of social authoritarianism in the name of common sense and decency.</p> <p>By maintaining the distinction between the nation's most popular drug and other drugs, from cannabis to heroin and crack, the government has left alcohol out of the broader picture. It does not feature in the high-profile, cross-cabinet assault on drugs; there is no alcohol tsar. By concentrating on \"yob culture\", says Heather, \"They are responding to a real and growing problem in this country. But the sheer quantity and severity of problems created by alcohol abuse are many times greater than all those caused by illicit drugs put together.\"</p> <p>And even though alcohol abuse has a serious effect in every area that the government has made a priority, from homelessness to health, from crime to education (one in four school exclusions is related to alcohol) there has been no coordinated approach to the issue. The response has emanated from Downing Street and the Home Office and has been framed strictly in terms of crime and punishment.</p> <p>Launching its action plan to tackle alcohol-related crime in August, the Home Office called for greater use of existing laws to confiscate alcohol from young people and to prevent the sale of alcohol to them as well as new powers for the police to close premises associated with violent and disorderly behaviour.</p> <p>The approach is useful as far as it goes, say alcohol experts. The problem is that it doesn't nearly go far enough. \"It's a start,\" says Appleby. \"But we need a national alcohol strategy that deals with issues across the board rather than just the behavioural end of it. They are relatively safe while they're just dealing with yob culture. But for any lasting effect they also have to tackle the drinking habits of the average man in the pub.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "A new system for investigating complaints against the police was announced today by the government. An independent police complaints commission will take over from the existing police complaints authority, with powers to bring in civilian investigators. Under the new system, the most grave incidents, such as deaths in police custody, would be investigated by a mixed team of civilians and police officers, led by a civilian. Pressure groups like Inquest have called repeatedly for independent inquiries into deaths in custody. The new framework for police complaints is part of the government's response to the Macpherson report into the murder of Stephen Lawrence. Other significant changes include allowing people other than victims of alleged misconduct to make a complaint. Greater openness will be encouraged with investigating authorities required to provide a full account of the inquiry and action taken as a result. Dissatisfied complainants will be allowed to complain to the IPCC, which will have powers to reinvestigate. The framework for the IPCC, published yesterday by home office minister, Charles Clarke, was drawn up after consultation with the human rights pressure group, Liberty, and the consultants KPMG. Mr Clarke said: \"While the number of complaints against the police remains low and a credit to the professionalism of the service as a whole, the government has long supported the idea of a more independent system for dealing with serious complaints. \"Our resolve was affirmed with the recommendations of the Lawrence inquiry report and the home secretary's subsequent action plan.\" It is hoped the IPCC will be operating by 2003. The current system of dealing with police complaints is based on independent supervision rather than independent investigation. The PCA supervised 950 of the most serious complaints against the police in 1999-00. The chairman of the commission for racial equality, Gurbux Singh, welcomed the document. He said: \"Getting the handling of complaints against the police right will be an important part of the work of building a new and effective relationship of mutual support and understanding between our police services and Britain's ethnic minorities.\" Press Association",

      "body": "<p>Adolf Hitler did not invent the idea of Nordic supremacy: the German Society for Racial Hygiene dates from 1895, and was not - originally - intended as an anti-Semitic force. It was concerned with maintaining the vigour of a racial group. Its founder ranked the Jews along with the Aryans as two of the world's premier civilising forces. The implication, however, was that the Jews were separate. Forget about people ever being separate but equal. When people become separate, they become \"them\". When they become \"them\", they tend to become unacceptable. Once they become unacceptable, any bad things that happen to them do not matter. </p> <p>Bad things have happened, since 1900, between Turk and Armenian, Russian and Jew, German and Jew, German and Slav, Hindu and Muslim, Boer and Bantu, Chinese and Tibetan, Iraqi and Kurd, Hutu and Tutsi, Serb and Bosnian, Serb and Kosovan. In each case the willingness of ordinary humans to debase and murder their neighbours has left a smear on the outgoing century. There is a lesson in how such things could come about in Five Steps To Tyranny. </p> <p>Five Steps is a politics lesson, conducted by Sheena McDonald and based on a series of academic experiments, some of them so shocking they have never been repeated. In one of the most notorious, a psychologist asked volunteer interrogators to administer increasing electric shocks to a victim - an actor, of course - shrieking and begging for mercy in another room. \"Do I have to do this? It hurts him\", they would say, and the experimenter would answer \"Do it. I will take responsibility.\" And most of them did it, apparently because a man with a white coat and a calm voice told them to do so. They were, after all, only obeying orders. </p> <p>In 1968, after the assassination of Martin Luther King, an Iowa school teacher suggested a game for her third-year white, middle-class infants. Imagine, she said, that they were really two groups, one blue-eyed, one brown-eyed. The blue-eyed kids were good, smart and privileged, and the brown-eyed ones were stupid and naughty and would never get anywhere. Within a day or so, she had effectively recreated apartheid in the playground; one group was cock of the walk and one group was cowed and weeping. \"He called me names,\" said one tearful child. \"What did he call you?\" \"He called me brown-eyed.\" </p> <p>In the most shocking example of all, in the 1970s, an American experimenter randomly divided his student volunteers into two groups, gave one epaulettes, clubs and reflector sunglasses and the other prison uniforms, and told the first group to guard the second. Each set of students proceeded to adopt their entirely fictitious personae with such terrible conviction that the three-week experiment had to be ended after five days. </p> <p>There have been more limited experiments which underline a preparedness to divide into \"us\" and \"them\" and outlaw \"them\". In one recent demonstration, a psychologist films unwary adult, responsible Manchester United supporters as a jogger collapses nearby. When the jogger wears a Manchester United fan club shirt, the passer-by rushes to help him. When he wears a Liverpool shirt, he is left to fend for himself. There is also a somewhat less convincing experiment on what looks like a Connex South East train, in which a polite but slightly menacing male asks passengers to surrender their seats to him, for no reason other than that he asks. Many of them do. When he is accompanied by a silent figure in uniform, all of them do. This could be evidence of the kind of social compliance that led ultimately to some of the century's most terrible crimes. On the other hand, it may be a desire not to upset the sort of slightly menacing nutter to be found on Connex South East... </p> <p>But there is no doubt about the programme's bottom line: tyrannies happen because ordinary people are surprisingly willing to do tyranny's dirty work. </p> <p>Programmes like this can show such things with great vividness - and there is news footage from Bosnia, or from Rwanda, or from Burma to back it up with terrible clarity. It isn't clear why the majority is so often compliant, but the implication is that democracy should always be grateful to the protesters, the members of the awkward squad, the people who challenge authority. </p> <p>But don't take it for granted that the awkward squad must be a force for good: in Germany, in the 1920s, Hitler was an outsider, a protester, a member of the awkward squad. When he came to power in 1932, he found that German medical professors and biologists had already installed a racial ideology for him, one which had already theorised about the elimination of sick or disabled German children, and the rejection of Jewish professionals as agents of pollution. </p> <p>People had theorised in similar ways in Sweden, and the United States. But Hitler turned ideas into action, and ordinary people were soon directing the trains to Dachau, and Auschwitz. The lesson, driven home by eight decades of movie newsreel and television reportage, is that appalling things can happen anywhere. The only comfort is that it remains possible for other people to be appalled. </p> <p>\u0095 Five Steps to Tyranny, 9pm, BBC2.</p>",

Within a day or so, she had effectively recreated apartheid in the playground; one group was cock of the walk and one group was cowed and weeping. \"He called me names,\" said one tearful child. \"What did he call you?\" \"He called me brown-eyed.\" In the most shocking example of all, in the 1970s, an American experimenter randomly divided his student volunteers into two groups, gave one epaulettes, clubs and reflector sunglasses and the other prison uniforms, and told the first group to guard the second. Each set of students proceeded to adopt their entirely fictitious personae with such terrible conviction that the three-week experiment had to be ended after five days. There have been more limited experiments which underline a preparedness to divide into \"us\" and \"them\" and outlaw \"them\". In one recent demonstration, a psychologist films unwary adult, responsible Manchester United supporters as a jogger collapses nearby. When the jogger wears a Manchester United fan club shirt, the passer-by rushes to help him. When he wears a Liverpool shirt, he is left to fend for himself. There is also a somewhat less convincing experiment on what looks like a Connex South East train, in which a polite but slightly menacing male asks passengers to surrender their seats to him, for no reason other than that he asks. Many of them do. When he is accompanied by a silent figure in uniform, all of them do. This could be evidence of the kind of social compliance that led ultimately to some of the century's most terrible crimes. On the other hand, it may be a desire not to upset the sort of slightly menacing nutter to be found on Connex South East... But there is no doubt about the programme's bottom line: tyrannies happen because ordinary people are surprisingly willing to do tyranny's dirty work. Programmes like this can show such things with great vividness - and there is news footage from Bosnia, or from Rwanda, or from Burma to back it up with terrible clarity. It isn't clear why the majority is so often compliant, but the implication is that democracy should always be grateful to the protesters, the members of the awkward squad, the people who challenge authority. But don't take it for granted that the awkward squad must be a force for good: in Germany, in the 1920s, Hitler was an outsider, a protester, a member of the awkward squad. When he came to power in 1932, he found that German medical professors and biologists had already installed a racial ideology for him, one which had already theorised about the elimination of sick or disabled German children, and the rejection of Jewish professionals as agents of pollution. People had theorised in similar ways in Sweden, and the United States. But Hitler turned ideas into action, and ordinary people were soon directing the trains to Dachau, and Auschwitz. The lesson, driven home by eight decades of movie newsreel and television reportage, is that appalling things can happen anywhere. The only comfort is that it remains possible for other people to be appalled. \u0095 Five Steps to Tyranny, 9pm, BBC2.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>The things people do alone in a hotel room. Do a handstand against the wall with your head in the wastepaper basket. Lay on the bed, rest your head on the bedside table and balance the bedside light on your ear. Use a bagel as a door-stop. Shove pens up your nostrils and in your ears, wedge plastic film canisters over your eyes, hold a stapler between your teeth. You look ridiculous, but no one can see you. Except the camera can: the above are but a few of Austrian artist Erwin Wurm's One Minute Sculptures, performed, enacted and recorded on video one desultory afternoon at the Adelphi Hotel, Liverpool. </p> <p>Wurm's photographs and videos currently fill the Photographers' Gallery in London. His art reminds me of writers' delaying tactics, when the deadline looms and the words won't flow. Stand at the window for a very long time. Have a scratch, have a biscuit. Make tea, even though you've just had coffee. Fiddle with the stapler, and accidentally hurt yourself. Staunch bleeding, then make more tea - or possibly Bovril this time. Patrol flat, work yet another shift at the window. Your eyes are unseeing, your mind empty, dangerously receptive to the more extreme and eccentric options that now begin to present themselves. How adults play, left to their own devices with everyday household objects. </p> <p>Wurm's sculptures nearly always involve the conjunction of the human body and an object, or a person and a place. Sculpture always has a relationship to the body - even if it is the spectator's own. Wurm's sculptures also exist in time: not the slowed-down time of objects in galleries or the almost geological time-scale of monuments and statues, but pocket-cartoon time, the moments, seconds, minutes it takes to perform the act and to get the gag. Wurm's One Minute Sculptures raise predictable, rhetorical questions about the relationship between performance, sculpture and photography. This is less interesting than the strangeness of the images, the peculiarity of the conjunctions of people and things. </p> <p>Although Wurm's work can be likened to the body sculptures of Rebecca Horn, or to Lygia Clark's manipulable objects, or to any number of Fluxus artworks and conceptual instructions, they are closer, to my mind, to the ad hoc works of Richard Tuttle, say, or the sculptures of fellow Austrian Franz West. The objects Wurm uses are never merely props. Wurm's own sculptures - or should we call them photographs? - have sometimes been appropriated and restaged by others: a One Minute Sculpture makes a fleeting appearance in a Macy Gray pop video and other works were re-staged, without consent or credit, by Ridge Forester for fashion shoots commissioned for Self Service magazine. </p> <p>The spontaneity and humour of Wurm's work borders on stupidity. What he investigates, surely, is play. His images are arresting and he makes us laugh - though were you to rely on Michael Newman's catalogue essay on Wurm for the Photographers' Gallery show, you'd be hard put to find much to laugh about. But I guess Newman's academic theorising (which tries not just to put the genie back in the bottle, but to seal the bottle in a vault, and to bury the vault under a ton of bombproof concrete) is a considered foil to Wurm's light touch. </p> <p>When I look at Wurm's photos of actions with bananas - two young men in suits standing close together, sharing the same banana, still in its skin - I think of the business with the banana in Krapp's Last Tape. You can't really say that Wurm's work is Beckettian, because Beckett's gags with stones, bananas, bits of string, pencil stubs, bicycles and so on are invariably painful plays on the relationship between people and the world of things. The clownishness is fraught with the recalcitrance and morbidity of objects, their farcical, unavoidable symbolism. Wurm's gags are relatively depleted, almost purely physical, even if they have a certain absurd poetry, especially when he gets other people to follow his instructions. </p> <p>One series of photos, taken on a rainy day in the streets of Taipei, have an uncanny atmosphere. A girl sits in a car, a mushroom up each nostril. A man sits on the roof of a car stalled in traffic, as though he were a piece of luggage. A young woman lies face down on the wet pavement outside a household goods store, her face in a plastic bowl. A man kneels in the middle of the road, amidst the rainy reflections of neon and traffic lights. These are the sort of things that might show up, unannounced and unexplained, in a Jim Jarmusch movie. </p> <p>Another series of Outdoor Sculptures are taken in Cahors, France. A man standing at a wall, as though beheaded, his head disappeared in a hole in the wall. A graveyard, with an ankle and foot emerging from another hole in a wall (this looks so like a Robert Gober sculpture it is hard to consider on its own terms). A man lying on the cobbles, a sofa lain across him, as though it had just fallen from the sky above the Rue Mar\u00e9chal Foch.

      "bodyText": "The things people do alone in a hotel room. Do a handstand against the wall with your head in the wastepaper basket. Lay on the bed, rest your head on the bedside table and balance the bedside light on your ear. Use a bagel as a door-stop. Shove pens up your nostrils and in your ears, wedge plastic film canisters over your eyes, hold a stapler between your teeth. You look ridiculous, but no one can see you. Except the camera can: the above are but a few of Austrian artist Erwin Wurm's One Minute Sculptures, performed, enacted and recorded on video one desultory afternoon at the Adelphi Hotel, Liverpool. Wurm's photographs and videos currently fill the Photographers' Gallery in London. His art reminds me of writers' delaying tactics, when the deadline looms and the words won't flow. Stand at the window for a very long time. Have a scratch, have a biscuit. Make tea, even though you've just had coffee. Fiddle with the stapler, and accidentally hurt yourself. Staunch bleeding, then make more tea - or possibly Bovril this time. Patrol flat, work yet another shift at the window. Your eyes are unseeing, your mind empty, dangerously receptive to the more extreme and eccentric options that now begin to present themselves. How adults play, left to their own devices with everyday household objects. Wurm's sculptures nearly always involve the conjunction of the human body and an object, or a person and a place. Sculpture always has a relationship to the body - even if it is the spectator's own. Wurm's sculptures also exist in time: not the slowed-down time of objects in galleries or the almost geological time-scale of monuments and statues, but pocket-cartoon time, the moments, seconds, minutes it takes to perform the act and to get the gag. Wurm's One Minute Sculptures raise predictable, rhetorical questions about the relationship between performance, sculpture and photography. This is less interesting than the strangeness of the images, the peculiarity of the conjunctions of people and things. Although Wurm's work can be likened to the body sculptures of Rebecca Horn, or to Lygia Clark's manipulable objects, or to any number of Fluxus artworks and conceptual instructions, they are closer, to my mind, to the ad hoc works of Richard Tuttle, say, or the sculptures of fellow Austrian Franz West. The objects Wurm uses are never merely props. Wurm's own sculptures - or should we call them photographs? - have sometimes been appropriated and restaged by others: a One Minute Sculpture makes a fleeting appearance in a Macy Gray pop video and other works were re-staged, without consent or credit, by Ridge Forester for fashion shoots commissioned for Self Service magazine. The spontaneity and humour of Wurm's work borders on stupidity. What he investigates, surely, is play. His images are arresting and he makes us laugh - though were you to rely on Michael Newman's catalogue essay on Wurm for the Photographers' Gallery show, you'd be hard put to find much to laugh about. But I guess Newman's academic theorising (which tries not just to put the genie back in the bottle, but to seal the bottle in a vault, and to bury the vault under a ton of bombproof concrete) is a considered foil to Wurm's light touch. When I look at Wurm's photos of actions with bananas - two young men in suits standing close together, sharing the same banana, still in its skin - I think of the business with the banana in Krapp's Last Tape. You can't really say that Wurm's work is Beckettian, because Beckett's gags with stones, bananas, bits of string, pencil stubs, bicycles and so on are invariably painful plays on the relationship between people and the world of things. The clownishness is fraught with the recalcitrance and morbidity of objects, their farcical, unavoidable symbolism. Wurm's gags are relatively depleted, almost purely physical, even if they have a certain absurd poetry, especially when he gets other people to follow his instructions. One series of photos, taken on a rainy day in the streets of Taipei, have an uncanny atmosphere. A girl sits in a car, a mushroom up each nostril. A man sits on the roof of a car stalled in traffic, as though he were a piece of luggage. A young woman lies face down on the wet pavement outside a household goods store, her face in a plastic bowl. A man kneels in the middle of the road, amidst the rainy reflections of neon and traffic lights. These are the sort of things that might show up, unannounced and unexplained, in a Jim Jarmusch movie. Another series of Outdoor Sculptures are taken in Cahors, France. A man standing at a wall, as though beheaded, his head disappeared in a hole in the wall. A graveyard, with an ankle and foot emerging from another hole in a wall (this looks so like a Robert Gober sculpture it is hard to consider on its own terms). A man lying on the cobbles, a sofa lain across him, as though it had just fallen from the sky above the Rue Mar\u00e9chal Foch. Somehow, this image seems to refer to the famous trick photograph of Yves Klein flying from a window. These conjunctions are more staged incidents than sculptures. Other photographs undermine the status and dignity of the person depicted: The Bank Manager In Front of His Bank has the middle-aged banker looking utterly unconcerned, although thick white stalks of asparagus dangle from his nose, like monstrous fangs or vegetal tusks.

A grimmer aspect is highlighted now in the Johnson &amp; Johnson Night and Day study of sleep patterns of new mothers which, among other sad statistics, suggests that 16 weeks after the birth, around a third of women are still suffering lack of sleep and 11% are severely sleep deprived. For 39% of those getting less than three hours' sleep in a given night, the result was something between \"unhappiness\" and \"extreme unhappiness\". These mothers feel disoriented, out of control, unable to complete simple tasks.</p> <p>The other interesting finding (but are we surprised?) was that 85% of women were doing most of the night care of the baby, only 11% were sharing it equally with their partners and a mere 4% were leaving most of it to the fathers.

Luckily for him most new mothers didn't have the time or mental energy to buy, let alone read, the newspaper or I suspect there would have been hordes of us outside Downing Street, joining in the chorus of \"Liar, liar, pants on fire\".</p> <p>What's happened to us all? We've got everything else sussed - we're earning as well as our male partners, the flat is jointly owned, the men are sharing the housework.

Then suddenly the real baby's here and we are reduced to tired, tearful madwomen, ambushed by gender stereotypes.</p> <p>But how much should the man be doing? Most of the women in my antenatal group took the view that when the woman is away from her job and the man is at work, it's fair that the woman undertake all the night care during the week. Other women I have spoken to agree. Marie, for example, thinks it is fair enough for her husband to sleep in the spare room: \"I see no point in both of us being tired and the fact that he is relatively well rested means that when he comes in from work, I can rest for a bit and likewise at weekends.\" Again and again, that seems to be all many women are looking for: a chance to catch up on sleep.</p> <p>Is this because, 30-odd years after Millett, Friedan et al taught us otherwise, we still fail to see childcare as real work? Psychotherapist Susie Orbach thinks so. The perception, she says, is that the woman is at home doing nothing. \"This terrible deal gets struck where the person at work gets to sleep through because the other person is doing 'nothing' all day.\"</p> <p>Looking after a new baby \"is so fantastically fatiguing and emotionally overwhelming, the person at work could do with less sleep because they are doing something they know how to do, whereas the new mother is learning something new every second\".</p> <p>The danger is that once the pattern is set during maternity leave, it never really changes. Although the Night and Day study did not include any women who had returned to work, all the recent research shows that in families in which women and men both work full-time, the majority of women do a great deal more domestic work than their partners. That is likely to include the night-time care of children, which goes on for years. As Susan Maushart says in her book The Mask of Motherhood: \"I have no doubt sleep deprivation is the greatest single contributing factor to women's precarious mental state during the active years of early mothering. It is also the least researched.\"</p> <p>So why aren't we insisting on men doing more? It seems sometimes women themselves have a hard time moving away from a perception that work involves the accomplishment of particular tasks, towards an acceptance that the chaos involved in looking after a new baby is also work. Dr Harriet Gross, the psychologist who conducted the Night and Day study, says that what stresses out many sleep-deprived new mothers is the feeling that they haven't accomplished anything because they have not completed various finite tasks they may have set for themselves in a day instead of being absorbed by the endless round of dressing, changing, feeding, holding and jiggling that is babycare.</p> <p>For some women, too, the reason they don't insist the man does more at night is the enjoyment they derive from caring for the baby. As Gross says: \"Looking after children is a tiring activity which is not perceived to be work because of the other benefits.\" In other words, because of the pleasure you get when she smiles at you from her bath, you would feel guilty if you treated looking after your baby as work.</p> <p>Other women practise what psychologists have called \"gatekeeping\" behaviour: they don't let the man take on many of the burdens of looking after the new baby because they value the intensity of the one-on-one relationship with it and don't really want the dad intruding (or they worry about his competence).</p> <p>For every mother jealously guarding her turf, however, I suspect there must be several like Claire, who says ruefully: \"My husband tried to do the Friday and Saturday night feeds but it never worked well.

      "body": "<p>Bengt Hambraeus, who has died aged 72, was one of the most significant figures of postwar Swedish music. A prolific composer of almost 200 works, he was best known for his pioneering organ music, for instance, Constellations I (1958) - later acknowledged by Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti as a primary influence on his own ground-breaking Volumina (1961) - and Interferences (1962).</p> <p>Hambraeus was the first Swedish composer to write an electro-acoustic score, Doppelrohr II, in 1955, and in his classic Constellations II (1959), taped sections from Constellations I were mixed with electronically created sounds.

      "bodyText": "Bengt Hambraeus, who has died aged 72, was one of the most significant figures of postwar Swedish music. A prolific composer of almost 200 works, he was best known for his pioneering organ music, for instance, Constellations I (1958) - later acknowledged by Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti as a primary influence on his own ground-breaking Volumina (1961) - and Interferences (1962). Hambraeus was the first Swedish composer to write an electro-acoustic score, Doppelrohr II, in 1955, and in his classic Constellations II (1959), taped sections from Constellations I were mixed with electronically created sounds. These placed Hambraeus at the forefront of the Nordic avant-garde, a position he maintained with an uncommon integrity of purpose, never needing to court sensation or deliberately provoke audiences, as did Ligeti. Born in Stockholm, Hambraeus began studying the organ in 1944, concentrating on the great German tradition of JS Bach and Reger, to whose memory his early Organ Sonata in E minor (1946) and Toccata Monumentum per Max Reger (1973) were dedicated.

      "body": "<p>Sir William Henderson, who has died aged 87, was a Scottish veterinary surgeon and research scientist who became, in retirement, director of the London Zoo. But he began his distinguished professional career as a world expert on foot and mouth disease (FMD).</p> <p>When he started his research in 1939, foot and mouth was a major cause of economic loss in much of Europe, South America, Asia and Africa. Henderson rose rapidly to become deputy director of the FMD Research Institute at Pirbright, Surrey, and subsequently (1957-66) director of the foot and mouth disease centre at the Pan American Health Organisation in Rio de Janeiro.</p> <p>On return to the United Kingdom he became, successively, director of the Agricultural Health Council's Institute of Animal Health (1967-72), secretary to the Agricultural Research Council (ARC, 1972-78) and president of the Zoological Society of London, 1984-89.</p> <p>The only son of a company manager, Henderson was educated at George Watson's College in Edinburgh, and took a veterinary qualification at the Royal Veterinary College and Edinburgh University. As a young researcher at the Animal Virus Research Institute, Pirbright, he developed an accurate and sensitive method for measuring the amount of FMD in infectious materials, by multiple inoculations into the tongue of anaesthetised cattle. Later, he used the same technique with vesicular stomatitis viruses in cattle. This work earned him an Edinburgh DSc.</p> <p>In Rio, Henderson was responsible for diagnosis and vaccine control in most of Latin America. He learned Spanish and Portuguese, and fostered an improvement in international collaboration that earned him wide influence and many awards from professional associations and governments. He advised the US and UK governments on safe importation of ruminant meat, especially from Argentina.</p> <p>At the Institute of Animal Health, he carried through a major programme of modernisation of laboratory buildings. Then, in 1972, he was invited by the then minister of agriculture, James Prior, to take on the job of ARC secretary, at the same time as another top scientific administrator, Sir Charles Periera, became chief scientist at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Maff).</p> <p>Fortunately, the two men had similar backgrounds and viewpoints, for they were called on to apply the customer-contractor relationship that had been implicit in the Rothschild Report (1972) on the organisation of government research and development. By agreeing to moderate the impact of a potential transfer of more than 50% of the ARC funds to Maff, they ensured a smooth transition to the new regime.</p> <p>In retirement, Henderson became a lively chairman of the veterinary advisory committee of the Horserace Betting Levy Board and initiated moves by Lord Carnavon to establish the Equine Virology Research Foundation. He was appointed chairman, from 1979-81, of the new Genetic Manipulation Advisory Group, a consultant to the Wellcome Foundation and a board member of Celltech and Wellcome Biotechnology.</p> <p>When Sir William, at the age of 70, succeeded Lord Zuckerman as chairman of the Zoological Society of London, its direction and finances were uncertain. With Lord Peyton of Yeovil as treasurer, Henderson obtained a government grant of \u00a310m to give the zoo time to recover its self-supporting status and attain wider scientific integration.</p> <p>He was knighted in 1976 and elected to a fellowship of the Royal Society of London. He received numerous other honours and honorary doctorates. Throughout his extraordinarily diverse and active life \"Gregor\" Henderson, as he was known, remained a genial and approachable man, an efficient chairman skilled in obtaining a consensus near to his own convictions, and a great memoriser of people and their personal qualities.</p> <p>He is survived by Beryl, his wife of almost 60 years, and four sons.</p> <p>\u0095 Sir William 'Gregor' MacGregor Henderson, veterinary surgeon, research scientist and administrator, born July 17 1913; died November 29 2000</p>",

      "bodyText": "Sir William Henderson, who has died aged 87, was a Scottish veterinary surgeon and research scientist who became, in retirement, director of the London Zoo. But he began his distinguished professional career as a world expert on foot and mouth disease (FMD). When he started his research in 1939, foot and mouth was a major cause of economic loss in much of Europe, South America, Asia and Africa. Henderson rose rapidly to become deputy director of the FMD Research Institute at Pirbright, Surrey, and subsequently (1957-66) director of the foot and mouth disease centre at the Pan American Health Organisation in Rio de Janeiro. On return to the United Kingdom he became, successively, director of the Agricultural Health Council's Institute of Animal Health (1967-72), secretary to the Agricultural Research Council (ARC, 1972-78) and president of the Zoological Society of London, 1984-89. The only son of a company manager, Henderson was educated at George Watson's College in Edinburgh, and took a veterinary qualification at the Royal Veterinary College and Edinburgh University. As a young researcher at the Animal Virus Research Institute, Pirbright, he developed an accurate and sensitive method for measuring the amount of FMD in infectious materials, by multiple inoculations into the tongue of anaesthetised cattle. Later, he used the same technique with vesicular stomatitis viruses in cattle. This work earned him an Edinburgh DSc. In Rio, Henderson was responsible for diagnosis and vaccine control in most of Latin America. He learned Spanish and Portuguese, and fostered an improvement in international collaboration that earned him wide influence and many awards from professional associations and governments. He advised the US and UK governments on safe importation of ruminant meat, especially from Argentina. At the Institute of Animal Health, he carried through a major programme of modernisation of laboratory buildings. Then, in 1972, he was invited by the then minister of agriculture, James Prior, to take on the job of ARC secretary, at the same time as another top scientific administrator, Sir Charles Periera, became chief scientist at the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Maff). Fortunately, the two men had similar backgrounds and viewpoints, for they were called on to apply the customer-contractor relationship that had been implicit in the Rothschild Report (1972) on the organisation of government research and development. By agreeing to moderate the impact of a potential transfer of more than 50% of the ARC funds to Maff, they ensured a smooth transition to the new regime. In retirement, Henderson became a lively chairman of the veterinary advisory committee of the Horserace Betting Levy Board and initiated moves by Lord Carnavon to establish the Equine Virology Research Foundation. He was appointed chairman, from 1979-81, of the new Genetic Manipulation Advisory Group, a consultant to the Wellcome Foundation and a board member of Celltech and Wellcome Biotechnology. When Sir William, at the age of 70, succeeded Lord Zuckerman as chairman of the Zoological Society of London, its direction and finances were uncertain. With Lord Peyton of Yeovil as treasurer, Henderson obtained a government grant of \u00a310m to give the zoo time to recover its self-supporting status and attain wider scientific integration. He was knighted in 1976 and elected to a fellowship of the Royal Society of London. He received numerous other honours and honorary doctorates. Throughout his extraordinarily diverse and active life \"Gregor\" Henderson, as he was known, remained a genial and approachable man, an efficient chairman skilled in obtaining a consensus near to his own convictions, and a great memoriser of people and their personal qualities. He is survived by Beryl, his wife of almost 60 years, and four sons. \u0095 Sir William 'Gregor' MacGregor Henderson, veterinary surgeon, research scientist and administrator, born July 17 1913; died November 29 2000",

Kerr told her that all her problems were sexual and then assaulted her. He also exposed himself to the woman on a later visit. </p> <p>Judge Arthur Myerson, at Leeds crown court, also gave the crown prosecution service a week to decide whether to seek a retrial of the undecided charges. </p> <p>A jury at a previous hearing had decided that Kerr was too ill to plead, but the seriousness of the charges led to the unusual \"hearing of fact\" trial, held without Kerr having to give evidence from the dock. </p> <p>The three-week case heard claims of systematic abuse over a 30-year career. Patients from Harrogate, Ripon and York said that their complaints were disregarded by their GPs as hysterical over-reactions by unstable women. </p> <p>Kerr was accused of abusing his power as the area's principal psychiatric consultant, and telling vulnerable women that their complaints would not be believed. </p> <p>At yesterday's hearing he was cleared of two charges of indecent assault. He was also cleared last week of two rape charges and two of indecent assault. Many of the alleged offences date back two decades before Kerr retired in 1988. </p> <p>After the verdict, the judge said that he had extremely limited sentencing powers in a \"hearing of fact\" case. </p> <p>He gave an absolute discharge to Kerr, who was not at the trial, saying that the \"very difficult\" case and the absence of a plea meant that the retired consultant was not formally guilty of a criminal offence. </p> <p>\"The verdict recognises, however, that Dr Kerr has taken advantage of one of his patients for his own sexual gratification,\" he said, adding that because the former consultant was in \"precarious\" physical and mental health, he was not a danger to the public. </p> <p>\"I have little doubt that there are those in this court who believe that this is not an adequate order,\" he said. \"That is not for them to decide, that is for me. No other sentence is practical in the circum-stances.\" </p> <p>Kerr was arrested in 1997 after a former patient made a complaint to the police. </p> <p>Ensuing media publicity led to 13 other women coming forward with allegations of rape and indecent assault.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A retired consultant was yesterday put on the sex offenders register for indecently assaulting a highly vulnerable psychiatric patient 14 years ago. William Kerr, 75, will remain on the list for five years for the offence but the jury failed to reach a verdict on 12 other charges including two of rape. The court heard that the woman was referred to him by her GP after experiencing an overdose, the death of her husband and behavioural problems with her young daughter. Kerr told her that all her problems were sexual and then assaulted her. He also exposed himself to the woman on a later visit. Judge Arthur Myerson, at Leeds crown court, also gave the crown prosecution service a week to decide whether to seek a retrial of the undecided charges. A jury at a previous hearing had decided that Kerr was too ill to plead, but the seriousness of the charges led to the unusual \"hearing of fact\" trial, held without Kerr having to give evidence from the dock. The three-week case heard claims of systematic abuse over a 30-year career. Patients from Harrogate, Ripon and York said that their complaints were disregarded by their GPs as hysterical over-reactions by unstable women. Kerr was accused of abusing his power as the area's principal psychiatric consultant, and telling vulnerable women that their complaints would not be believed. At yesterday's hearing he was cleared of two charges of indecent assault. He was also cleared last week of two rape charges and two of indecent assault. Many of the alleged offences date back two decades before Kerr retired in 1988. After the verdict, the judge said that he had extremely limited sentencing powers in a \"hearing of fact\" case. He gave an absolute discharge to Kerr, who was not at the trial, saying that the \"very difficult\" case and the absence of a plea meant that the retired consultant was not formally guilty of a criminal offence. \"The verdict recognises, however, that Dr Kerr has taken advantage of one of his patients for his own sexual gratification,\" he said, adding that because the former consultant was in \"precarious\" physical and mental health, he was not a danger to the public. \"I have little doubt that there are those in this court who believe that this is not an adequate order,\" he said. \"That is not for them to decide, that is for me. No other sentence is practical in the circum-stances.\" Kerr was arrested in 1997 after a former patient made a complaint to the police. Ensuing media publicity led to 13 other women coming forward with allegations of rape and indecent assault.",

Fifteen civil servants and five ministers were criticised by Lord Phillips's inquiry into the disaster. Many of the civil servants have subsequently resigned or retired. Ministers responded to the Phillips report two months ago by setting up a review led by Sheila Forbes, a civil service commissioner. Her recommendations may be published in the next few days to lift the shadow hanging over the civil servants' careers. In setting up the Forbes inquiry, the agriculture secretary, Nick Brown, hinted strongly he was personally opposed to disciplinary action against civil servants. He told MPs last month: \"Whenever serving public servants are subjected to criticism by a public inquiry, the question arises whether any form of disciplinary action should be taken\". He then quoted from the Phillips report, which said: \"If those criticised were misguided, they were nonetheless acting in accordance with what they conceived to be the proper performance of their duties\". Mr Brown also stressed in his Commons statement that some of the individuals criticised receive praise from the inquiry, but there is no corresponding list of individuals who are praised. The Phillips inquiry criticised the individuals, mainly in the Ministry of Agriculture and Department of Health, on the grounds that they should have acted differently in light of the information that they had available at the time. The bulk of the criticism cen tered on civil servants failing to do more to bring the potential dangers of BSE to ministers attention. Civil servants criticised include William Rees, chief veterinary officer between 1980 and 1988, and his successor up to 1997, Keith Meldrum. The report also highlighted deficiencies by Sir Keith Calman the chief medical officer to 1998. Phillips also attacked the head of the ministry of agriculture animal health division Robert Lowson. The chief medical officer for Scotland between 1991-1996, Robert Kendell, was also criticised for making misleading statements about the safety of beef. The report also criticised Thomas Eddy, head of Maff animal health (disease control) division from June 1993 for misleading minutes concerning the possibility that CJD cases in young people might prove to be linked with BSE.",

AcoustICA, the organisers of the ICA's Stockhausen Day, focused on pieces written during this period, as well as later works by other composers that revealed the consequences of Stockhausen's work. </p> <p>The final work in the day's two concerts was the oldest: the 1953 Kontra-Punkte, performed by the Contemporary Arts Ensemble under Zsolt Nagy. It synthesises the wizardry of Stockhausen's complex compositional procedures with profound musical expression. In 1953 the piece was shockingly acerbic; in 2000, Stockhausen's integration of structure with drama is stunningly complete. Nagy and his players performed Kontra-Punkte with delicacy, as the texture gradually thinned from the full ensemble of 10 instruments to solo piano. </p> <p>Benjamin Kobler's virtuosity at the piano was crucial to the success of Kontra-Punkte. In the earlier concert, he demonstrated the range of his gifts in four of the 11 Klavierst\u00fccke Stockhausen composed in the 1950s. Klavierst\u00fcck V was a series of self-contained, fantastical gestures. In contrast, No VII focused on the resonances of repeated notes. Individual pitches were surrounded by brilliant fluorescences of harmonic and rhythmic colour. The compact pyrotechnics of VIII were followed by Klavierst\u00fcck XI, one of the first pieces in which the performer, not the composer, chooses the order of the musical events. Kobler had prepared his own score of the work, rather than leaving those decisions to be made spontaneously during the performance. Even if this robbed the piece of its theatrical element, there was no doubting the quality of Kobler's playing. </p> <p>At the start of the day, percussionist Laszlo Hudacsek gave a scintillating account of Zyklus, a piece that extends the bold violence of many of the Klavierst\u00fccke. But there is another side to Stockhausen's music, revealed by a performance of Refrain. Written in 1959 and scored for piano, percussion and celeste, it turns its players into an ensemble of glittering music-boxes. Responding to each other with vocal clicks and percussive bells and gongs, Kobler, Hudacsek and Nagy brought a beguiling theatricality to their performance. </p> <p>There was more theatre in the second concert in Claude Vivier's piece Bouchara, performed by the Contemporary Arts Ensemble with soprano Sarah Leonard. Setting Vivier's own, invented language, Bouchara contained music that was both sensual and primeval. Enhancing the work's air of mysterious ritual, the piece culminated in elemental tape sounds. Sinan Savaskan's Unique Strands, Circular Functions and Portofino, a world premiere, grew impressively from a luminous wash of colour to a striking climax. And Stefan Wolpe's Piece for Two Instrumental Units returned to the structuralism of the 1960s, with music of glorious modernist abandon. </p> <p>But the real revelation was a performance of Stockhausen's groundbreaking 1960 piece Kontakte. This work was among the first written for both live musicians and tape; everything that the composer had achieved before seems to be distilled in it.

The Paris premiere was staged by Peter Sellars, and the music critics who turned up in droves to witness it no doubt expected a grand spectacle, a successor to Adams's acclaimed large-scale operas Nixon in China and The Death of Klinghoffer. This retelling of the nativity story is certainly not that, but what we did see and hear was much harder to pin down. </p> <p>Adams has said he wrote the piece as a way of trying to understand what is meant in biblical terms by a miracle (his working title was How Could This Happen?). So his beautifully varied libretto draws on the Old and New Testaments, as well asalternative sources such as the Gnostic Infancy Gospels, and intersperses the sequence with texts by later Hispanic writers. Though the biblical narrative, from the annunciation to the flight into Egypt, is preserved, it is only one element in a much more elaborate literary tapestry. </p> <p>Though the title brings with it associations of natural disasters and, by extension, what Adams calls the \"alarming force\" that is part and parcel of miracles, the total effect of El Nino is more like a meditation on these events than a theatrical presentation of them, while the music itself, often quiet and reflective, only rarely barnstorming or dramatic, and never celebratory, does not drive the story forward so much as enhance it in other, more subtle ways. In its mood and purpose the result seems far closer to Berlioz's l'Enfance du Christ, say, than it is to Handel's Messiah, let alone a genuinely operatic work. </p> <p>For that reason especially, it would have been much easier to appreciate the special qualities of the score for the first time in a concert performance rather than in the theatrical framework that Sellars has devised. A specially shot film is projected throughout the almost two hours of music, reinterpreting the events of the nativity in present-day West Coast terms as a drama involving a group of Hispanics: Mary and Joseph are a young, homeless couple, the Three Kings are reincarnated as LA cops, and so on. Mean while, some rather ineffectual choreography for a trio of dancers (who also appear in the film) is woven around the movements of the three soloists and the chorus. </p> <p>Following this parallel narrative, with its rather over-familiar Sellars landscape of metaphors, only distracts from the music and the rich detail of the texts. The unfamiliar pyschological glosses from the gospel of James, the fairy tale-like anecdotes of dragons and magical palm trees from Pseudo-Matthew, the mysticism of Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz, and the wonderful rawness of the poems by Rosario Castellanos and Gabriela Mistral sometimes fail to register because there is too much information to absorb. </p> <p>The performance, though, is remarkable. The playing of the Deutsches Symphonie under Kent Nagano, a long-time Adams champion, is wonderfully assured. All the details of the instrumentation, with its brittle edges provided by pairs of guitars and synthesisers, are in place, and the pacing of a score that often carries on where the seamless melodic flows of his last orchestral work, Naive and Sentimental Music, left off, seems utterly natural. </p> <p>The soprano numbers are sung by Dawn Upshaw, whose tendency to make everything sound like Oklahoma! is cunningly exploited by Adams in numbers that recall the more introverted music of Nixon in China. The mezzo is allotted the majority of the Spanish-language settings in lyrical writing of the greatest beauty and intensity, and it is hard to imagine anyone delivering it more exquisitely than Lorraine Hunt Lieberson. Willard White is the baritone, making every word count, and vividly depicting both the alarm of Joseph when he discovers that Mary is pregnant, and the narration of Herod's anger. </p> <p>A trio of countertenors from the Theatre of Voices support and echo the principals, though the chorus, the London Voices, do struggle to get their words across. More clarity will surely come with more performances, when it will also be possible to get to grips more completely with Adams's musical and literary achievement. The bad news is that El Nino will not reach London (the Barbican) until 2003. </p> <p>\u0095 Performances until Saturday (box office: 00 33 1 40 28 28 40) and televised on BBC Knowledge next Saturday.</p>",

Dutch in Stoker's novel, Van Helsing is here a German haunted by Nazi atrocities, and this allows Holloway to use the blood motif as symbolic of the quest for racial purity. No need then for Count Dracula and his blood-suckers - this is Nosferatu as the spectre of German war-guilt. Richard Heap's Van Helsing is a commanding hybrid of intellectual arrogance and fevered remorse, but the Nazi undercurrent doesn't quite cohere. </p> <p>Holloway's script feels as if it began as a straight adaptation of Stoker's novel and then tried to turn elsewhere. With a cast of only four, doubling-up is required; but even so, important characters in the novel - not least Mina and Jonathan Harker - are introduced far too late. </p> <p>Confusingly, Harker's journal is either narrated by Van Helsing or recited by a voice-over. And in the scene where Renfield drinks Dr Seward's blood, the drama is curtailed when the doctor steps to the front of the stage to tell us what happened next. </p> <p>Still, there are strong performances, particularly from Matthew Lloyd Davies, who measures every step to good effect as the timid but tenacious Jack Seward, doctor at the asylum and the foil to Van Helsing's inscrutable gravity. Keith Lancaster as the fly-eating madman Renfield, meanwhile, does not quite compare to Tom Waits's brilliantly tongue-curling performance in the 1992 Francis Ford Coppola film of Dracula. And what's more, he sounds worryingly like William Hague. </p> <p>Lucy Burden has more success as Lucy Westenra, affording her a tortured girlishness with a squeaky voice and some wonderfully concerned expressions. </p> <p>As befits the genre, there are elements of self-parody - how else can you get away with all that howling wind and screaming? - and the production is big on melodramatic music, dry ice, fake blood and a rotating minimalist set designed to screen every shift of shadow and light.
