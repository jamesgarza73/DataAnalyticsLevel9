      "bodyText": "The first public list of people and companies who donate money to political parties was published today in a move to restore public confidence in campaign financing ahead of a general election. Any donation of more than \u00a35,000 to a national party, or above \u00a31,000 to a local constituency party, must appear on the list, or the offending political party will face a fine, possible imprisonment of the party treasurer - and scathing headlines from the press. The new register comes as a result of the Neill committee into standards in public life and is administered by the independent Electoral Commission. The chairman of the Electoral Commission, Sam Younger, said: \"The aim is to establish openness and transparency in the financial affairs of Britain's political parties. \"We are delighted that the information will be freely available and easily accessible to all via the internet.\" The register, the first of its kind in the UK, shows the Tories received almost \u00a345,000 from private companies during February and March, with Labour clocking up just \u00a33,360 in the same period - all of it from the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union. The Liberal Democrats push the Conservatives a close second with exactly \u00a330,953.39. The Electoral Commission - a body which monitors elections in the UK and the fundraising of all political parties - was set up in the wake of the cash for questions allegations which dogged the John Major government. Now all donations above \u00a3200 must come from individuals on the UK electoral roll, or companies registered in Britain or the European Union. More than 100 political parties are registered with the Electoral Commission, although 88 of those have had no donations to report. Nine parties have complied with the regulations, and nine more have failed to comply. The Commission is now chasing those nine parties, although they are thought to be small operations. Labour was heavily criticised earlier this year after it was revealed they had solicited multi-million pound donations just before the February 16 deadline for gifts to be declared. Lord Hamlyn, who gave \u00a32m to Labour, was finally forced to come into the open after a two day media frenzy trying to uncover the identity of the mystery donor. The Tories announced the biggest single political donation to a political party - \u00a35m from spread betting millionaire Stuart Wheeler - within days. The first edition of the register, which will be published quarterly, covers the period February 16 - the setting up of the Electoral Commission - to the end of March.

      "body": "<p>Having collaborated on a triumphant Richard II, the same actor-director team of Samuel West and Steven Pimlott now give us a strikingly similar Hamlet : cliche-free, anti-romantic, visually spare and politically vivid. Played on a thrust-forward stage, complete with Japanese-style walkway, it runs for four hours and is totally gripping. </p> <p>What is startling is Pimlott's ability to create a plausible Elsinore through the simplest means. Alison Chitty's set is a white box that takes on contrasting colours through Peter Mumford's superb lighting. But we instantly know what kind of world we're in - an elective tyranny - when Larry Lamb's glad-handing Claudius is greeted with volleys of sycophantic applause by his name-tagged acolytes. And it's a measure of Pimlott's avid eye for detail that when, four hours later, a bandolier-bedecked Fortinbras claims \"I have some rights of memory in this kingdom\", he is greeted by the self-same Voltemand earlier despatched as ambassador to Norway.</p> <p>Defining Elsinore instantly throws Hamlet 's dilemma into sharp relief: you don't just rush off and kill a protected presidential figure like Claudius. And the keynote of West's fine Hamlet is a mordant intelligence and sense of political impotence. This Hamlet has a built-in bullshit detector that enables him to see through his own, and other people's, rhetoric. And if he packs a pistol, he is more likely to use it against himself than Claudius: indeed, he points it at his own temple before invoking the divine injunction against self-slaughter. Effectively marginalised by Claudius, West's Hamlet turns inwards at one point he even shares a spliff with his old mates Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.</p> <p>Each actor creates his own Hamlet and West's is sardonic, clever and cruelly aware of his own powerlessness. When the First Player describes the immobilised Pyrrhus confronting Priam, West brilliantly echoes the phrase about the way Pyrrhus \"did nothing\". If I miss anything in his performance, it is the youthful sexual confusion vividly highlighted by Stephen Dillane but that is partly because Kerry Condon's slight, fey Ophelia seems an unlikely lover for this Hamlet , who would obviously be doing his PhD at Wittenberg.</p> <p>It is, however, a rare piece of undercasting in an ensemble that bats all the way down. Lamb's Claudius is a brutally charismatic strong-arm politician Marty Cruickshank's Gertrude is a disenchanted sensualist who looks meaningfully at her husband when she makes a coarse joke in the midst of her threnody over Ophelia and Alan David's Polonius is a pompously nasty piece of work.</p> <p>We have lately had a rash of depoliticised Hamlets. Pimlott puts power back at the play's centre and, with West, makes it enthrallingly clear that Hamlet 's tragedy is that he is the paralysed individual conscience in a world of realpolitik.</p> <p>Until October 13. Box office: 01789 403403.</p>",

What is startling is Pimlott's ability to create a plausible Elsinore through the simplest means. Alison Chitty's set is a white box that takes on contrasting colours through Peter Mumford's superb lighting. But we instantly know what kind of world we're in - an elective tyranny - when Larry Lamb's glad-handing Claudius is greeted with volleys of sycophantic applause by his name-tagged acolytes. And it's a measure of Pimlott's avid eye for detail that when, four hours later, a bandolier-bedecked Fortinbras claims \"I have some rights of memory in this kingdom\", he is greeted by the self-same Voltemand earlier despatched as ambassador to Norway. Defining Elsinore instantly throws Hamlet 's dilemma into sharp relief: you don't just rush off and kill a protected presidential figure like Claudius. And the keynote of West's fine Hamlet is a mordant intelligence and sense of political impotence. This Hamlet has a built-in bullshit detector that enables him to see through his own, and other people's, rhetoric. And if he packs a pistol, he is more likely to use it against himself than Claudius: indeed, he points it at his own temple before invoking the divine injunction against self-slaughter. Effectively marginalised by Claudius, West's Hamlet turns inwards at one point he even shares a spliff with his old mates Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. Each actor creates his own Hamlet and West's is sardonic, clever and cruelly aware of his own powerlessness. When the First Player describes the immobilised Pyrrhus confronting Priam, West brilliantly echoes the phrase about the way Pyrrhus \"did nothing\". If I miss anything in his performance, it is the youthful sexual confusion vividly highlighted by Stephen Dillane but that is partly because Kerry Condon's slight, fey Ophelia seems an unlikely lover for this Hamlet , who would obviously be doing his PhD at Wittenberg. It is, however, a rare piece of undercasting in an ensemble that bats all the way down. Lamb's Claudius is a brutally charismatic strong-arm politician Marty Cruickshank's Gertrude is a disenchanted sensualist who looks meaningfully at her husband when she makes a coarse joke in the midst of her threnody over Ophelia and Alan David's Polonius is a pompously nasty piece of work. We have lately had a rash of depoliticised Hamlets. Pimlott puts power back at the play's centre and, with West, makes it enthrallingly clear that Hamlet 's tragedy is that he is the paralysed individual conscience in a world of realpolitik.

Credit unions have been extolled time and again by Labour ministers. But now its members face a shattering loss. </p> <p>It was mainly West Indians who founded the union some 20 years ago when they were denied ordinary bank accounts. So they set up their own community bank on the North Peckham estate, (where Damilola Taylor was murdered), drawing in people from every background paying in some \u00a35 a week. </p> <p>They include the student single mother who scraped together \u00a3220 for her son's future, the Irish widow on benefits with two children who will lose \u00a3350, the 67-year-old West Indian chef who will lose \u00a33,500 for his old age and the elderly woman whose son put \u00a35,000 into her account as she had no savings; 24 people had \u00a3800 each put into their accounts by Southwark council for new furnishings when they were decanted while the estate is rebuilt. </p> <p>They have all been told that due to bad debts, they will only get 50p in the pound back: if it is forced to close, the liquidators fees will take the rest. </p> <p>The Financial Services Authority (FSA) discovered a shortfall of \u00a3200,000 and ordered the books to be frozen as an insolvent organisation. It was not fraud but over-lenient lending that destroyed them, as has happened before with these small, amateur run banks. </p> <p>The very thing that makes credit unions so attractive to urban regenerators, encouraging social enterprise with deep community roots, is also what makes them perilously vulnerable. If Camberwell goes under it will send a frightening message to all the other 450 community credit unions. Expect a run on them by vulnerable people who simply cannot afford to take any risks. It could spell the end for many small community unions. </p> <p>A rescue is being attempted by Harriet Harman together with Tessa Jowell, whose constituents are among the losers. The FSA is doing what it can to help. Southwark council has put in \u00a320,000. The necessary \u00a3200,000 is not a large sum for the Treasury and big banks to stump up between them. But the Treasury has so far refused, claiming it would set a precedent for bailing others out. </p> <p>However, as from July 2002 an excellent new law designed to strengthen credit unions will bring their members under the same umbrella as banks, protecting savers from any future collapse. So a Treasury rescue only risks a minor precedent for another year. </p> <p>The British Banking Association has been asked for help too, but so far not a penny has been forthcoming. Banks have no interest in picking up 3,000 poor customers who cost more than they bring in. The only hope is that some might see this good cause will bring them better publicity than they could ever buy with a mere \u00a3200,000 of advertising. Particularly as the money would only be needed as a long-term guarantee and they would probably get it back. </p> <p>\"Financial exclusion\" has much exercised this government - a big phrase for not having any money. With puritan fervour this chancellor is trying to create a savings culture to help the feckless poor who save too little. </p> <p>There have been brainstorming seminars inside Number 11 and much research commissioned to delve into the savings habits of the poor. (Most were found to be \"jamjarring\".) Imaginative new schemes have been devised, such as baby bonds to give poor children a capital start in life. Or the new \"savings gateway\" where the government will match pound for pound any money the poor manage to save. </p> <p>The other hope was the promised Universal Bank, to be set up within the post office. It should have been unveiled with a flourish yesterday, but at the last fence the deeply antagonistic banks balked again: so far not one of the 11 have signed the Memorandum of Understanding to bring it into being. </p> <p>They have dragged their heels and succeeded in yet again trouncing the government, offering the minimum while contributing a minimal sum. The DTI has been frustrated in its negotiations by the Treasury forbidding them from threatening the banks with any hint of compulsion or punishment. \"It would have been handy to have more cards in our hand,\" said one DTI negotiator ruefully. </p> <p>Banks never wanted poor customers cluttering up their queues, paying in and out piffling sums at more cost than they were worth. Banks rarely lend sums under \u00a31,000, so the poor needing small loans have only the loan sharks charging anything up to 150%, from whom they never escape. Now it emerges that the Universal Bank has partly stalled because all the commercial banks are arguing amongst each other, not competing for this new custom but each fighting to take on as little as possible. </p> <p>When the Universal Bank was first announced, ministers talked boldly of the banks' \"moral obligation\" to compensate society for with drawing from rural and poor urban areas. Now it will probably be a puny thing, primarily a cheaper way for the government to pay out benefits and a support for post offices - no use at all in helping the poor avoid crippling loan shark debt.</p> <p>Benefits will be paid into post office \"card accounts\", that do nothing else. Post offices will then urge people to go into banks and open basic accounts which offer almost nothing - and certainly no loans, though they can at least be accessed thereafter over post office counters. This is barely better than the jam jar: government claims that people can get discounts from paying utility bills by direct debit cut no ice with all those who can never afford to pay bills all at once. </p> <p>Credit unions which require people to accumulate some savings before they qualify for small loans are a model of Brown prudence. However this admirable but pathetically small movement with just 100,000 community members and very shaky financial viability, usually only open for half a day a week, is not the answer for millions of people who need safe savings and loans with good financial advice. </p> <p>Credit unions need to be professionalised, with government help. As for the Universal Bank, if Mrs Thatcher could windfall commercial banks, the chancellor could at least threaten it, unless they provide a decent savings and loan service for rich and poor alike. </p> <p><a href=\"mail to:polly.toynbee@theguardian.com\">polly.toynbee@theguardian.com</a></p>",

However this admirable but pathetically small movement with just 100,000 community members and very shaky financial viability, usually only open for half a day a week, is not the answer for millions of people who need safe savings and loans with good financial advice. Credit unions need to be professionalised, with government help. As for the Universal Bank, if Mrs Thatcher could windfall commercial banks, the chancellor could at least threaten it, unless they provide a decent savings and loan service for rich and poor alike. polly.toynbee@theguardian.com",

      "byline": "Lisa Bachelor",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong>Why are the two banks merging?</strong><br> According to Halifax and Bank of Scotland, the boards of the two banks involved, the merger is \"a compelling business combination\". Translated, this means the two banks hope to increase profitability by increasing their stake in the marketplace and cross-selling each other's products. </p> <p><strong>What's in it for Halifax?</strong><br> Halifax converted from a building society to a bank in 1997 and, as a result, has felt the pressure of becoming a company answerable to its shareholders. The bank needed to look for new ways to make money and the merger with BoS means it will have a strong presence in the United Kingdom banking sector for the first time. </p> <p><strong>What's in it for Bank of Scotland?</strong><br> The merger allows Bank of Scotland to expand its business from its home turf to the whole of the UK. The successful merger follows the Bank of Scotland's failed merger attempts with Abbey National and NatWest. </p> <p><strong>When did the two banks get it together?</strong><br> The two banks surprised the City a couple of weeks back on April 25 when they announced their intention to merge. Since that time, there has been much speculation over who would head the new bank and where they would be based. The decision was reached today (May 4)) that James Crosby, chief executive of Halifax, would head the new bank and the headquarters will be based in the Scottish bank's home of Edinburgh.</p> <p><strong>How much will the new bank be worth?</strong><br> The \u00a328bn merger creates the UK's fifth largest bank, with 57,000 staff and more than 1,000 branches. The move is described as a \"merger of equals\", although Halifax is the larger partner with 37,000 employees and a market value of about \u00a318bn. BoS has some 20,000 staff and is valued at more than \u00a310bn. </p> <p><strong>What does the merger mean for shareholders?</strong><br> It's too early to say, as the value of shares is largely dependent on the successful management of the new bank. Certainly, the merger has had little impact on the London market so far. However, Bank of Scotland chief executive, Peter Burt is optimistic saying he believes the deal will be \"earnings enhancing\" for the bank's shareholders.</p> <p><strong>How will customers benefit from the merger?</strong><br> While the newly formed bank says the deal will offer \"substantial benefits\" for customers, most remain sceptical about the impact of the combined forces of the banks on its customer base. Certainly, the bank could well become a significant challenger to the \"big four\" high street banks, but this is dependent on skilful management of the new holding. The bank will hold a strong position in retail, corporate banking, small business banking and long-term savings and insurance. </p> <p><strong>How could customers lose out?</strong><br> Mergers bring with them a narrowing of choice in the marketplace, which is not a good thing for customers. Existing Halifax and BoS customers are also likely to find themselves bombarded with junk mail from both banks as the two cross-sell each others products. An American study of bank mergers found that, in the majority of cases, cost cutting was achieved by redundancies, but less than half of the mergers improved the banks efficiency.</p> <p><strong>What does it mean for employees of the banks?</strong><br> For many, it will mean redundancies. The bank says that over the next three years it is expected that there will be a reduction of about 2,000 jobs across the group. However, the good news for those remaining is that the new bank promises to retain existing employment rights, including accrued pension rights.</p> <p><strong>Will the bank's branches be affected?</strong><br> The bank says that both Bank of Scotland and Halifax will remain as separate institutions and will continue to trade under the current brand names. However, it is likely that branch closures will ensue where Halifax and Bank of Scotland occupy spaces in the same street.</p>",

Halifax converted from a building society to a bank in 1997 and, as a result, has felt the pressure of becoming a company answerable to its shareholders. The bank needed to look for new ways to make money and the merger with BoS means it will have a strong presence in the United Kingdom banking sector for the first time. What's in it for Bank of Scotland? The merger allows Bank of Scotland to expand its business from its home turf to the whole of the UK. The successful merger follows the Bank of Scotland's failed merger attempts with Abbey National and NatWest. When did the two banks get it together? The two banks surprised the City a couple of weeks back on April 25 when they announced their intention to merge. Since that time, there has been much speculation over who would head the new bank and where they would be based. The decision was reached today (May 4)) that James Crosby, chief executive of Halifax, would head the new bank and the headquarters will be based in the Scottish bank's home of Edinburgh. How much will the new bank be worth? The \u00a328bn merger creates the UK's fifth largest bank, with 57,000 staff and more than 1,000 branches. The move is described as a \"merger of equals\", although Halifax is the larger partner with 37,000 employees and a market value of about \u00a318bn. BoS has some 20,000 staff and is valued at more than \u00a310bn. What does the merger mean for shareholders? It's too early to say, as the value of shares is largely dependent on the successful management of the new bank. Certainly, the merger has had little impact on the London market so far. However, Bank of Scotland chief executive, Peter Burt is optimistic saying he believes the deal will be \"earnings enhancing\" for the bank's shareholders. How will customers benefit from the merger? While the newly formed bank says the deal will offer \"substantial benefits\" for customers, most remain sceptical about the impact of the combined forces of the banks on its customer base. Certainly, the bank could well become a significant challenger to the \"big four\" high street banks, but this is dependent on skilful management of the new holding. The bank will hold a strong position in retail, corporate banking, small business banking and long-term savings and insurance. How could customers lose out? Mergers bring with them a narrowing of choice in the marketplace, which is not a good thing for customers. Existing Halifax and BoS customers are also likely to find themselves bombarded with junk mail from both banks as the two cross-sell each others products. An American study of bank mergers found that, in the majority of cases, cost cutting was achieved by redundancies, but less than half of the mergers improved the banks efficiency. What does it mean for employees of the banks? For many, it will mean redundancies. The bank says that over the next three years it is expected that there will be a reduction of about 2,000 jobs across the group. However, the good news for those remaining is that the new bank promises to retain existing employment rights, including accrued pension rights. Will the bank's branches be affected? The bank says that both Bank of Scotland and Halifax will remain as separate institutions and will continue to trade under the current brand names. However, it is likely that branch closures will ensue where Halifax and Bank of Scotland occupy spaces in the same street.",

But, by the time he finished it in 1998, the Sinfonietta was no more, and it has languished until it was programmed by the full symphony orchestra. Sawer slightly bolstered the scoring for this performance, but it remains modest, requiring just classically sized forces. </p> <p>Musica ficta is an early music term for the addition of accidentals, sharps and flats to avoid awkward intervals to sing or play, even though they were not indicated in the score. Sawer extends the idea, not just using it to switch his music between white notes and black, tonality and chromaticism, but to cross-cut ideas in the way that gives his music its pungency and fascination. </p> <p>There are passages of an almost Copland-like pastoralism next to music far more sinewy and complex, but what propels the piece is the alert rhythmic invention. The strings are soon snapping away with Stravinskian vigour, and throughout the 10-minute course of the piece every idea seems to be drawn towards that kind of assertiveness. </p> <p>One of Sawer's great gifts is his ability to make even the most straightforward gesture into something far more intriguing. In the second half a simple upward-scale movement fragment takes on a whole range of resonances until it finally evaporates in the last moments of the piece.

Alison Chitty's set is a white box that takes on contrasting colours through Peter Mumford's superb lighting. But we instantly know what kind of world we're in - an elective tyranny - when Larry Lamb's glad-handing Claudius is greeted with volleys of sycophantic applause by his name-tagged acolytes. And it's a measure of Pimlott's avid eye for detail that when, four hours later, a bandolier-bedecked Fortinbras claims \"I have some rights of memory in this kingdom\", he is greeted by the self-same Voltemand earlier despatched as ambassador to Norway. </p> <p>Defining Elsinore instantly throws Hamlet's dilemma into sharp relief: you don't just rush off and kill a protected presidential figure like Claudius. And the keynote of West's fine Hamlet is a mordant intelligence and sense of political impotence. This Hamlet has a built-in bullshit detector that enables him to see through his own, and other people's, rhetoric. And if he packs a pistol, he is more likely to use it against himself than Claudius: indeed, he points it at his own temple before invoking the divine injunction against self-slaughter. Effectively marginalised by Claudius, West's Hamlet turns inwards; at one point he even shares a spliff with his old mates Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. </p> <p>Each actor creates his own Hamlet and West's is sardonic, clever and cruelly aware of his own powerlessness. When the First Player describes the immobilised Pyrrhus confronting Priam, West brilliantly echoes the phrase about the way Pyrrhus \"did nothing\". If I miss anything in his performance, it is the youthful sexual confusion vividly highlighted by Stephen Dillane; but that is partly because Kerry Condon's slight, fey Ophelia seems an unlikely lover for this Hamlet, who would obviously be doing his PhD at Wittenberg. </p> <p>It is, however, a rare piece of undercasting in an ensemble that bats all the way down. Lamb's Claudius is a brutally charismatic strong-arm politician; Marty Cruickshank's Gertrude is a disenchanted sensualist who looks meaningfully at her husband when she makes a coarse joke in the midst of her threnody over Ophelia; and Alan David's Polonius is a pompously nasty piece of work. </p> <p>We have lately had a rash of depoliticised Hamlets. Pimlott puts power back at the play's centre and, with West, makes it enthrallingly clear that Hamlet's tragedy is that he is the paralysed individual conscience in a world of realpolitik. </p> <p> Until October 13.

His powers are strategic, setting plans, targets and budgets and appointing people to implement them. \u0095 The boroughs still run most of the services Londoners use on a day-to-day basis. They also retain important local powers over planning, transport and regeneration. \u0095 The London assembly also forms an integral part of the GLA set up. The 25-strong body's main power is to block the mayor's budget on a two-thirds majority.",

No reading beats reading about love. Anna Karenina, Jane Eyre, The Golden Bowl - twisted and upsetting love stories, but love is twisted and upsetting. And here's my quarrel with the romantic novel: by ironing out the twists, it makes a eunuch of desire. And where's romance without desire? It's not because I insist on high seriousness that I would like to see those 200m volumes trashed; it's because, by the very nature of their ambition - to keep love simple - they are never romantic enough.</p> <p>Call me a softie but my eye still waters when I read Emma contemplating \"the exquisite delight\" of her future as Mrs Knightley. \"Serious she was, very serious, in her thankfulness and in her resolutions; and yet there was no preventing a laugh, sometimes in the very midst of them.\" The seriousness not without a certain submissiveness, the laugh not without a certain spite, and the whole thing touching because all we know of the woman, her quickness and kindness, her impulsiveness and condescension (her eroticism is taken for granted), finds fulfilment in this finally awakened passion. What could be more romantic? She has hit upon the man of her dreams who just happens to be the man who's been there for her all along!

In an instant, his arms were around her and he was kissing her back furiously. He tasted wonderful ... Hannah felt herself melt in response.\" No need to labour the point.</p> <p>But I have no desire to submit poor Kelly to a contest with Jane Austen. Austen isn't literature because she uses better or harder words; she becomes literature, becomes romantic literature if you like, by making her characters alive in love as in all their other endeavours, beings who think and judge, speak and laugh, and when they do melt, feel to their hearts the degree of their disintegration.</p> <p>The other minor drawback of the romantic novel, Weldon says, is its refusal to countenance comedy. \"No jokes, please, no irony. This is not, repeat not, the literature of alienation.\" Free the romantic novel from the bleak obligations of alienation and it can claim to address us where we are warm and at home? Poppycock. Whatever cannot make room for a joke has nothing to do with warm life.</p> <p>This is another way in which romantic fiction resembles pornography.

No shame, though, seems to be attached to the torpor induced by romantic fiction.

Professor Paddy Hillyard and his colleagues are coming to the end of a three-year, \u00a392,000 study into crime in England and Wales. They aim to produce an atlas offering comparitive information on the levels of harm suffered by people around the country and the work of individual police departments. \"Because of the autonomy of chiefs of police, we found huge variablity in the way the law is enforced. The statistics are not done, but we are finding 15%-20% differences in forces' use of their powers, for example in terms of stop and search,\" said Professor Hillyard. Moreover, the research suggests that public concern and government spending on crime might be misplaced. Professor Hillyard said pollution was a key danger that kills many more people than crime. But while national crime statistics are compiled every year, there is no such programme for pollution. Even if the reporting of crime receives more money than other social ills, Professor Hillyard and his colleagues have still had to contend with statistical problems. Each local authority gathers its own statistics, a procedure that leads to huge variations in quality. Particularly, the Ulster team found crimes were being under-reported by some forces. Stop and search figures are a particular problem. But the researchers maintain that the new atlas will be the first authorative and compartive study of crime and social risk for the UK. Even with the new crime atlas, the UK will be a long way behind the US in offering public information on levels of danger. At various American websites, individuals can see exactly what levels of crime have been experienced in their street.

He remembers that towards the end of his career, \"I was beginning to feel there was a lethal layer of administration between me and my work.\" But maybe young academics have the advantage: they do not know what is impossible, and there is a resulting originality in their work. This year's Reith lecturer, Professor Tom Kirkwood from Newcastle University, agrees that the issue is not that retired people are more creative, but rather that senior academics are overburdened. \"I have discussed with colleagues before whether there shouldn't be a more even distribution of the administrative drains across the age range, so people don't get hit so hard by it later on,\" he said.

Stock prices and land values have fallen by two-thirds from their peaks.

Personal assets have nosedived. The Ezakis are among the millions of Japanese families who have seen the value of their home fall by more than a third in five years. </p> <p>Wages are shrinking.

The central bank's zero interest rate policy attracts few takers for loans. </p> <p>In the looking-glass world of deflation, nothing ventured is something gained. If you expect prices to fall rather than rise, procrastination becomes a virtue. By stashing her cash under the tatami, Mrs Iwaki effectively earned a deflation-adjusted return of 0.5% on the family's nest egg last year -much better than stock market punters, who lost 35% on the Nikkei index. </p> <p>But Japan is beginning to realise that the \"bubble\" was not merely a case of wind that can be cleared by with a deflationary belch.

Instead the country has had to run faster and faster to stand still. Despite running up the world's biggest public debt, of 130% of gross national product, government stimulus spending has only enabled Japan to create growth of just over 1% a year. Corporations have been repaying \u00a520 trillion more than they borrow each year, but they are barely making a dent in their debts because their property is worth less and the fall in prices is hurting their profits. Banks have written off \u00a554 trillion, but the amount of non-performing loans has increased because assets are deteriorating even faster. </p> <p><strong>Sense of proportion</strong><br> </p> <p>Mrs Iwaki is no economist, but she sees the same reflection in the looking glass and realises that drastic measures are necessary. In 1995, the Iwakis' two-bedroom \"mansion\" cost them \u00a558m. Last year, their neighbour sold up for \u00a538m. She knows that much of the money she is hoarding might one day have to be used to clear the family's loss on the house. Until then, they are trapped in negative equity. </p> <p>\"My husband and I often talk about what we'd do if it wasn't for this debt. A new car, a bigger house, another child... But it can't be helped. Until we shake off this debt, we're stuck.\" </p> <p>For her, coping with deflation means accepting that things have to get worse to get better. Like Alice, she sees the solution to her problems in terms of restoring a sense of proportion to a confused world. </p> <p>\"It may sound as if I have an inferiority complex, but it feels as if Japan is not worth what it was. That's not necessarily a bad thing. My hope is that our children will have different expectations, that they will value things differently. We have to teach them that price isn't everything.\"</p>",

Banks have written off \u00a554 trillion, but the amount of non-performing loans has increased because assets are deteriorating even faster. Sense of proportion Mrs Iwaki is no economist, but she sees the same reflection in the looking glass and realises that drastic measures are necessary. In 1995, the Iwakis' two-bedroom \"mansion\" cost them \u00a558m. Last year, their neighbour sold up for \u00a538m. She knows that much of the money she is hoarding might one day have to be used to clear the family's loss on the house. Until then, they are trapped in negative equity. \"My husband and I often talk about what we'd do if it wasn't for this debt. A new car, a bigger house, another child... But it can't be helped. Until we shake off this debt, we're stuck.\" For her, coping with deflation means accepting that things have to get worse to get better. Like Alice, she sees the solution to her problems in terms of restoring a sense of proportion to a confused world. \"It may sound as if I have an inferiority complex, but it feels as if Japan is not worth what it was. That's not necessarily a bad thing. My hope is that our children will have different expectations, that they will value things differently. We have to teach them that price isn't everything.\"",

He was also a fine poet, whose Collected Poems, his fourth volume, was published only recently.</p> <p>His personality concealed a certain puckishness. When he became a life peer in 1990, he expanded his name - to distinguish it from an earlier Lord Morris - by adding \"of Castle Morris\", a grand-sounding hamlet with a ruin on a side road to Haverstockwest, on the main road between Fishguard and St Davids. Although he was then principal of St David's University College, Lampeter, he had no connection with Castle Morris - \"I live in the middle of the Peak District, in Derbyshire,\" he cheerfully admitted.</p> <p>His death is a loss to Wales, with which he identified, despite working away from it most of his life.

      "bodyText": "Lord Morris of Castle Morris, who has died aged 70 from leukaemia, was a leading specialist in English literature, for 10 years professor of English literature at Sheffield University, having made his name as a critic and editor of English plays of the Elizabethan, Jacobean and Caroline periods. He was also a fine poet, whose Collected Poems, his fourth volume, was published only recently. His personality concealed a certain puckishness. When he became a life peer in 1990, he expanded his name - to distinguish it from an earlier Lord Morris - by adding \"of Castle Morris\", a grand-sounding hamlet with a ruin on a side road to Haverstockwest, on the main road between Fishguard and St Davids. Although he was then principal of St David's University College, Lampeter, he had no connection with Castle Morris - \"I live in the middle of the Peak District, in Derbyshire,\" he cheerfully admitted. His death is a loss to Wales, with which he identified, despite working away from it most of his life. Because he was Cardiff-born, his Welsh linguistic ability was limited. But he backed completely the effort to give the Welsh language full equality with English, while pleading for effective simultaneous translation in court cases. Although he only became a peer at 59, he acclimatised \"in about a week\", justifying his appointment by pointing out \"Manchester United football team isn't chosen by popular vote\". He worked arduously for the Labour party, using his considerable administration skills as deputy chief whip under Lord (Ted) Graham from 1992 and doubling up as Labour's active main spokesman on education from 1994. He lacked the trained politician's ability to debate extemporaneously or from notes. But his essayish speeches - more subtle and less pompous than those of Lord \"Roy\" Jenkins - were beautifully prepared and well-read, sprinkled with quotations from Shakespeare, Goldsmith, Juvenal and Alexander Pope. When Morris reminded the Tories of the saying \"Whom God wishes to destroy, he first sends mad,\" he delivered it first in the original Latin. But in 1997, the ageist Blair incomers dismissed him, along with Lord Graham, as too old and too \"Old Labour\". Curiously, his decade in the Lords overlapped with that of an old teacher. \"In the year of our Lord 1939, I was Master Brian Morris, aged eight, a pupil in Marlborough Road elementary school, Cardiff.

At Bonn he encouraged the performance of neglected works such as the opera Genoveva by Schumann, another composer whom Maag championed. From 1964-68, he was music director at the Vienna Volksoper.

A trial, involving 200 people who'd suffered from a \"major depression\" for at least four weeks, found the herb was no better than a placebo.

The trial had showed the drug to be ineffective and the company wanted the results suppressed. </p> <p>It was far from an isolated incident. Only last month the Lancet published a letter from a doctor claiming that the drug company Bayer, when asked for supplies of a certain drug so that he could run a trial on it, demanded he sign a letter promising not to reveal any results without their permission.

It's partly because poems are an effort, usually, through sheer length and density, and in competitions - as in magazine editing, actually, the effort is rarely repaid. But you have to put the work in, because, as the saying is, a poem is only as good as its reader. The beauty of this job was that you could get the measure of the whole piece in one go, even if as with a surprising number of them you were far from exhausting the poem in one or two reads. This was true of even the shortest of the long shortlist: \"They phone you up, your mum and dad.\" It didn't reach the final seven, but it's already a catchphrase in our house. What's more, it is postmodern (though admittedly it isn't bollocks), because of its self-referentiality, recasting (and therefore commenting on) a famous line of poetry while at the same time talking about mobiles, or at any rate about a generation independent but always because of the phone in shouting distance. Also, this poem made us laugh out loud. </p> <p>Still, \"They phone you up\" didn't make the cut because it depends too much on the Larkin line it parodies. Others though not as short were just as concise and presented stories or traded insights or humour often with texture of language and rhythmical purpose (as we say in the trade). \"Ying\", for instance, another spoof we were sorry to let go, has the oriental or rather new age whiff of a manx haiku: 'uncovered, I can/ still smell my wet hair/even in the dark.' </p> <p>As you might expect, a number of the entries were haikus. In Chinese, haikus are real poems because, so I'm told, neighbouring words alter each other's meanings, allowing the texts to open in the mind like paper flowers in a tumbler of water. Whereas in English, they tend to be short, up-their-own-arse poems made by grown men in brown cords walking up and down counting. I said as much once, the inspiration as it turned out for this: 'Peter Sansom says/Not to bother with haiku./Well, he can fuck off.' </p> <p>Which is to say one of the joys of the competition was how much grainy real-life could be got into 160 characters, though there was room for delicate watercolour too. The most interesting aspect, and which may actually be quite radical, is how having to scroll down the screen makes the reading experience entirely linear, giving real suspense to each line break, making us attend to every word and to guess ahead before the new line comes up. You can't help glancing down the page in ordinary poems for clues, for orientation; but with a text poem you stay focussed as it were in the now of each arriving line. </p> <p>This gives extra force, for instance, to punch lines, and indeed makes it seem an urgent business, reading a text poem, like the pools score teleprinter used to be, or how it was when Ezra Pound said poetry was news that stays news. </p> <p><strong> UA Fanthorpe's comments</strong><br> There is a quality of jokiness about English poetry, and the Guardian's terse verse contest encouraged that. So did its text message format, which has affinities with the resourceful stratagems of the old telegram. I like a poem that starts \"Pls, stop sendg msgs2ths\". The reader is being tested, as with a crossword puzzle or a Shakespeare play. </p> <p>Poetry has always enjoyed fiddling around with the shapes of words and numbers of words or number of syllables: haiku, cinquain, englyn, and so on, and I have to admit to writing a poem about a road sign, in road sign language, which consists partly of words with their vowels extracted and partly of shorthand versions of place names. So in a way, the newest thing about the Guardian's competition was not the text message style, but the precise number of characters available. </p> <p>It was interesting to see how inventive the competitors were. Some wrote fairly normal poems (as far as style is concerned); some wrote with as much technical resourcefulness as possible. The results were disappointing in some ways, in that the subjects tended to be rather predictable - the usual subjects, in fact: love/sex predominated, along with \"special moments\". </p> <p>I've recently been judging another (more familiar) poetry competition, where the range of subjects was infinitely more surprising. But it is, of course, difficult to get far with such a small word count; you have, on the whole, to be sure that the reader understands what you're writing about from the start. And limitation of form means that it's difficult to achieve very much complexity of feeling. </p> <p>I was looking for wit and technical inventiveness in the more technologically adventurous poems, and for imagination, density and the magical quality of take-off in the others. On the whole, the less technical did better - partly because the more technical had struggles with layout, and characteristically became unstuck with the last line, which is always where a poem either works or doesn't. </p> <p>There were some poems which I shall remember with delight, but which didn't achieve the Final Seven because there wasn't enough substance to them: I treasure particularly two. </p> <p>\"They phone you up, your mum and dad.\" </p> <p>\"Basildon: imagine a carpark.\" </p> <p>It was surprising how many competitors used rhyme, I suspect as a substitute for imagery. The form allowed only exceptionally gifted writers to develop an image to any extent, whereas the inevitable brevity made it quite easy to make something of a rhyme, if not exactly a rhyme-scheme. I was moved and amazed at how much feeling could be introduced in so small a space: there was great tenderness, spirit, imagination in the best entries. </p> <p>On the other hand, it was sad to see how some, faced with such a small canvas, squandered words when they could have used the possibilities more fruitfully.</p>",

Recently we switched to These Are The Days in tribute to the return of European football to Portman Road. And partly as the players had begun to complain about the name on national television.

      "body": "<p><strong>Hellish Nell: Last of Britain's Witches by Malcolm Gaskill.</strong> Fourth Estate, 402 pp., \u00a315.99, 5 April, 1 84115 109 2 <br><a href=\"http://www.booksunlimited.co.uk/bol/0,6206,1001002000397010,00.html\">Buy it at a discount from BOL</a></p> <p>April 1944. Winston Churchill sent a memo to Herbert Morrison at the Home Office: Let me have a report on why the Witchcraft Act, 1735, was used in a modern Court of Justice. What was the cost of this trial to the State, observing that witnesses were brought from Portsmouth and maintained here in this crowded London, for a fortnight, and the Recorder kept busy with all this obsolete tomfoolery, to the detriment of necessary work in the Courts? The person tried and convicted at the war-damaged Old Bailey was a stout and ailing Scotswoman called Helen Duncan, whom few people loved and many exploited. She was not a witch in any popular sense of the word; she did not fly, wear a pointed hat or have congress with the devil, and neither she nor her followers imagined that she did. She was a witch only in the sense that she was convicted under an old statute, as a convenience to the court. If the attention-grabbing title can be excused, it is because the author has a strange and pitiful tale to tell.</p> <p>Rumours of Churchill's indignation, and of his own spiritualist leanings, have been enough to make the case bob back into public consciousness every few years. As Malcolm Gaskill says, \"we inherit ancestral tales reworked by each generation to make their truth powerful rather than precise, moral rather than empirical.\" Among the majority today, reverence for Churchill survives surprisingly intact; it is a folk-tale Churchill who intervenes in the case, incisive and on the side of the underdog. In fact, as Gaskill shows, Churchill took no further part in either vilifying or vindicating Helen Duncan. If he was superstitious, that made him like many soldiers and ex-soldiers. If, as a young man, he had consulted an astrologer, then he was a natural leader for a nation that employed state stargazers to track the forecasts of their Nazi counterparts.</p> <p>Helen's trial lasted eight days, and ended with a jail sentence of ten months, which (less remission) she served in Holloway. Prosecuted psychics often elicited public sympathy, especially when the police were suspected of entrapment. Helen's tabloid image henceforth was as the 'St Joan of Spiritualism'. The charges against her arose from a police raid on a s\u00e9ance in Portsmouth, where informers were planted in the audience. Though Helen was a well-known medium who commanded a troop of followers, her deceptions on this occasion were no more florid, distasteful or ludicrous than the tricks she had been getting away with for years. Fortune-tellers were usually dealt with summarily under the Vagrancy Act of 1824: not hauled before judge and jury, flattered by the attentions of King's Counsel and the national press. So why was the silencing of Mrs Duncan considered so vital by the state?</p> <p>Her partisans, and conspiracy theorists in general, looked back to 1941, when at an earlier s\u00e9ance in Portsmouth Helen had raised the spirit of a young sailor. In life, he had served in HMS Barham. News of his materialisation soon spread among the families in the port. This was a source of dismay to the Admiralty, who had not yet admitted that the warship had gone down. Malcolm Gaskill explores this legend, which is central to the strange life of Helen Duncan. There is a question-mark over how specific Helen's identification was, and whether its precision increased in the retelling. Did Helen actually name the ship, or did she extract the name from an anxious audience member, and produce an apparition to suit? Had there been some security leak which had brought her the knowledge by ordinary means? However it may be, it does seem that MI5 was involved in building the case against her, and it is clear that she was seen as a security risk - damaging to morale, at least. However she got her peculiar knowledge, it was best to lock her up and teach her a lesson.</p> <p>Malcolm Gaskill has undertaken to tell the life-story of Helen Duncan, placing her in the context of her time and class. The book is also in a wider sense an enquiry into \"how we know the things we know\" and how what we can know or choose to know is circumscribed by our culture. As far as Helen and her trade is concerned, he will try for a position of observant neutrality: \"I do not seek to exonerate her, any more than I am committed to a rationalist crusade against superstition.\" A Cambridge historian, he is generally a prosaic and stable guide through what Freud called \"the black tide of mud of occultism\". Sometimes his material tempts him into a tweedy sarcasm, and sometimes he strays into twopenny-coloured mode; the people who queued to see Helen's trial were \"curious citizens, successors to the Londoners of Hogarth's day who had gathered there to follow the condemned to Tyburn, jeering and sharing the latest from the Grub Street presses\". Anyone who explores the issue of the paranormal is vulnerable, both to accusations of crankiness and to a sort of self-disgust about the sensationalism involved; and it is hard to sift out an acceptable truth, given the human tendency to confabulate, the fallibility of memory, the wide scope for interpretation, and the prejudice which invests the whole subject. As a good historian should, he insists, he is going to try to vanish in the presence of his subject. He would not like to think that, like some spirit guide made of papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9, he is now Helen's announcer, her mouthpiece, and that his dematerialisation amounts to crouching in the half-light behind a torn curtain on a rickety rail.</p> <p>He writes very well about Helen's background and her upbringing in the small Scottish town of Callander. Like much else about her, the date of her birth is uncertain. She was the fourth of eight children in the family of a skilled man, a slate-worker and builder. The family were not very poor, but their circumstances were modest and their outlook austere. At the age of seven or so Helen began to report clairvoyant experiences, which her mother warned her not to speak about outside the family. It was a part of the country where folk belief in second sight, omens and ghosts had simply slid underground, and her mother's warning was perhaps designed to protect her less against scepticism than unhealthy interest. The name of Hellish Nell, however, had nothing to do with preternatural abilities: she got it because she was a noisy, boisterous tomboy.</p> <p>But as she grew up, she developed what Gaskill describes as a \"crippling diffidence, timidity and passivity, punctuated by sudden outbursts of hysterical rage\". It was a passivity which allowed her to be strip-searched before her s\u00e9ances, tied to her chair, enveloped in sacks, sewn into shroud-like cocoons intended to prevent fraudulent limbs from emerging; which made her agree to swallow dye for test-s\u00e9ances, and allow her body cavities to be probed by doctors appointed by those who had an interest in proving that she was a cheat. One could argue, too, that it was this passivity which made her choose her trade in the first place, made her earn her living as the mouthpiece of dead people: travelling the roads of Britain, sustained by tea and endless cigarettes, her parasitic husband in tow, her paying public always fresh and expectant, the thought of her needy children ever in mind, and her heavy body always sicker, and apt to take on the sicknesses of other people. It is no wonder that the rage burst out from time to time, causing her to curse out loud, and lunge at sitters who upset her, and try to knock sceptics down with chairs. In the early 1930s, one witness described her as \"by no means a magnetic personality . . . rather a repellent one that aroused one's critical faculties\". There was nothing other-worldly about her coarse features and plain speech, and yet perhaps she was not so unattractive as the self-righteous and brutal busybodies who tried persistently to expose her. If there was money to be made from raising the dead, there was also a profit to be shown from proving the dead to be made of old newsprint and cheesecloth. With credulity on the one hand, bigotry on the other, and greed everywhere, the history of spiritualism shows humanity in an unedifying light.</p> <p>The town where Helen grew up was a poor community, with low wages and high unemployment. The average age at which women married was 26, which attests to the difficulty of setting up a separate household; the choice for many men was between migration and emigration. When the Great War broke out, the boys queued down the street to join up. But Hellish Nell, 16-years-old, pregnant and disgraced, had already been banished to Dundee, and would seldom return to Callander. In Dundee she lived in a working-woman's hostel and worked in a jute mill. She applied for munitions work, but was found to have TB, and sent to a sanatorium. Discharged, she took a post as an auxiliary at Dundee Royal Infirmary, where the sights and sounds of the psychiatric wing worked on what was already, no doubt, a morbid imagination. Her baby was a girl, and would be the first of eight children. Helen's pregnancies were perilous, and some of her children had birth defects. She suffered from a complex of conditions which exacerbated each other: she was hypertensive and diabetic, had kidney damage, and suffered from pleurisy and abdominal pains, which cannot have been helped by her self-punishing habit of ingesting carpet tacks and cigarette ends; it was not just her audience who swallowed rubbish.</p> <p>Her husband, Henry Duncan, was a Dundee boy who enlisted at 16. His very poor family had a history of hauntings, and Henry seems to have been superstitious, sensitive and intelligent. Later, he would become the theroretician, while Helen attended to the practical business of raising spooks. Most mediums were women, and the men - with revered exceptions like the great Victorian DD Home - were seedy after-thoughts with inferior talents. There was perhaps something degradingly feminine in the pursuit, in the helplessness, the physical indignity of being the plaything of the deceased; gifted men preferred to be impresarios, and manage their talented wives. Henry Duncan emerges from Gaskill's account as a manipulator and a liar, but his early life was sad beyond bearing. Invalided out of the Army with rheumatic fever, he would never regain good health. He met Helen through his sister, who was a workmate of hers, and they had no doubt that they were soul mates. They married in 1916, and their early years together were wretched, with one or other of them too sick to work, though Henry took on casual labouring where it was offered and Nell would turn her hand to anything. Henry started a furniture business which failed, seemingly not through his own fault; he had a heart attack, and Helen engaged herself to crippling work in the bleach-fields to feed them, at the same time taking in washing and mending, and organising the sale of stock to pay the creditors. In the end Henry became too ill to work, and spent his time reading spiritualist books; though Helen was widely known to be psychic, she had not yet embraced - if she ever did - the corpus of cult belief.</p> <p>Spiritualism thrived on disaster, and on poverty. The comfort of 'proved survival' was superior to the airy assurances, given over the years by the orthodox churches, that the deficits of this life would be repaired in the next. For the working classes it had this advantage: it did not operate de haut en bas. A practising and proficient medium was likely to arise in any stratum of society, and if you lived in one of Britain's cities you were likely to find one a few streets away. Spiritualism was a neighbourly, engrossing business, offering a particular and home-grown comfort. It thrived in the Mechanics Institutes and the philanthropic and self-improvement societies of the industrial towns. The great war gave it impetus: all kinds of occult belief flourished, among the fighting forces and among civilians. In the trenches, among men facing death minute by minute, chance incidents were blown up and acquired a magical dimension. When death is dealt out so randomly, the notion of cause and effect is lost. Phenomena like the 'Angel of Mons', invented by a popular writer, were subsequently 'seen' by thousands of soldiers.</p> <p>Peace brought little respite to the bereaved imagination. It was as if there was a widespread feeling that somewhere, just out of reach, the young men were still alive. Returning spirits were always in favour of world peace and brotherhood; they were never bellicose or revengeful. Trite though their messages were, one can hear in them the voices of the living, battered by disaster, pitchforked into quarrels of their masters' making. Where did the revolutionary impulse go, in British society? In the 18th century it went to sing hymns at Methodist meetings; in 1917, to bawl spiritualist anthems and sit tight, once again, in the hope of a fair deal in the hereafter. A great strength of Gaskill's book is that it provides, by the way, a piece of working-class history: he makes spiritualism comprehensible in the context of the utter bleakness of the lives he describes. The night Henry Duncan's mother died - a diabetic, worn out, an old woman at 40 - Henry and Nell saw her disembodied hand tapping at their window; they recognised it by the marks of her trade, the scars across her palm made by her herring-gutter's knife. The bitterness of imagination that could give rise to such an image, the poverty that bred it, the pity it inspires: all these are part of Helen Duncan's story, and part of a common story which suggests a hunger for consolation which only a new religion could assuage.</p> <p>If the context is tragic, however, the daily practice of spiritualism was a theatrical spectacle that, as Gaskill says, drew on 'farce, burlesque and vaudeville'. Spiritualism, in its modern form, began in 1848 in upstate New York, where the teenage Fox sisters heard rapping noises in their farmhouse, found human bones in their cellar, and soon afterwards struck a deal with the showman Phineas T Barnum. Gaskill has a whole catalogue of comic and grotesque manifestations which could only have fooled the most suggestible of sitters, or those determined to get value for money.

      "bodyText": "Hellish Nell: Last of Britain's Witches by Malcolm Gaskill. Fourth Estate, 402 pp., \u00a315.99, 5 April, 1 84115 109 2 Buy it at a discount from BOL April 1944. Winston Churchill sent a memo to Herbert Morrison at the Home Office: Let me have a report on why the Witchcraft Act, 1735, was used in a modern Court of Justice. What was the cost of this trial to the State, observing that witnesses were brought from Portsmouth and maintained here in this crowded London, for a fortnight, and the Recorder kept busy with all this obsolete tomfoolery, to the detriment of necessary work in the Courts? The person tried and convicted at the war-damaged Old Bailey was a stout and ailing Scotswoman called Helen Duncan, whom few people loved and many exploited. She was not a witch in any popular sense of the word; she did not fly, wear a pointed hat or have congress with the devil, and neither she nor her followers imagined that she did. She was a witch only in the sense that she was convicted under an old statute, as a convenience to the court. If the attention-grabbing title can be excused, it is because the author has a strange and pitiful tale to tell. Rumours of Churchill's indignation, and of his own spiritualist leanings, have been enough to make the case bob back into public consciousness every few years. As Malcolm Gaskill says, \"we inherit ancestral tales reworked by each generation to make their truth powerful rather than precise, moral rather than empirical.\" Among the majority today, reverence for Churchill survives surprisingly intact; it is a folk-tale Churchill who intervenes in the case, incisive and on the side of the underdog. In fact, as Gaskill shows, Churchill took no further part in either vilifying or vindicating Helen Duncan. If he was superstitious, that made him like many soldiers and ex-soldiers. If, as a young man, he had consulted an astrologer, then he was a natural leader for a nation that employed state stargazers to track the forecasts of their Nazi counterparts. Helen's trial lasted eight days, and ended with a jail sentence of ten months, which (less remission) she served in Holloway. Prosecuted psychics often elicited public sympathy, especially when the police were suspected of entrapment. Helen's tabloid image henceforth was as the 'St Joan of Spiritualism'. The charges against her arose from a police raid on a s\u00e9ance in Portsmouth, where informers were planted in the audience. Though Helen was a well-known medium who commanded a troop of followers, her deceptions on this occasion were no more florid, distasteful or ludicrous than the tricks she had been getting away with for years. Fortune-tellers were usually dealt with summarily under the Vagrancy Act of 1824: not hauled before judge and jury, flattered by the attentions of King's Counsel and the national press. So why was the silencing of Mrs Duncan considered so vital by the state? Her partisans, and conspiracy theorists in general, looked back to 1941, when at an earlier s\u00e9ance in Portsmouth Helen had raised the spirit of a young sailor. In life, he had served in HMS Barham. News of his materialisation soon spread among the families in the port. This was a source of dismay to the Admiralty, who had not yet admitted that the warship had gone down. Malcolm Gaskill explores this legend, which is central to the strange life of Helen Duncan. There is a question-mark over how specific Helen's identification was, and whether its precision increased in the retelling. Did Helen actually name the ship, or did she extract the name from an anxious audience member, and produce an apparition to suit? Had there been some security leak which had brought her the knowledge by ordinary means? However it may be, it does seem that MI5 was involved in building the case against her, and it is clear that she was seen as a security risk - damaging to morale, at least. However she got her peculiar knowledge, it was best to lock her up and teach her a lesson. Malcolm Gaskill has undertaken to tell the life-story of Helen Duncan, placing her in the context of her time and class. The book is also in a wider sense an enquiry into \"how we know the things we know\" and how what we can know or choose to know is circumscribed by our culture. As far as Helen and her trade is concerned, he will try for a position of observant neutrality: \"I do not seek to exonerate her, any more than I am committed to a rationalist crusade against superstition.\" A Cambridge historian, he is generally a prosaic and stable guide through what Freud called \"the black tide of mud of occultism\". Sometimes his material tempts him into a tweedy sarcasm, and sometimes he strays into twopenny-coloured mode; the people who queued to see Helen's trial were \"curious citizens, successors to the Londoners of Hogarth's day who had gathered there to follow the condemned to Tyburn, jeering and sharing the latest from the Grub Street presses\". Anyone who explores the issue of the paranormal is vulnerable, both to accusations of crankiness and to a sort of self-disgust about the sensationalism involved; and it is hard to sift out an acceptable truth, given the human tendency to confabulate, the fallibility of memory, the wide scope for interpretation, and the prejudice which invests the whole subject. As a good historian should, he insists, he is going to try to vanish in the presence of his subject. He would not like to think that, like some spirit guide made of papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9, he is now Helen's announcer, her mouthpiece, and that his dematerialisation amounts to crouching in the half-light behind a torn curtain on a rickety rail. He writes very well about Helen's background and her upbringing in the small Scottish town of Callander. Like much else about her, the date of her birth is uncertain. She was the fourth of eight children in the family of a skilled man, a slate-worker and builder. The family were not very poor, but their circumstances were modest and their outlook austere. At the age of seven or so Helen began to report clairvoyant experiences, which her mother warned her not to speak about outside the family. It was a part of the country where folk belief in second sight, omens and ghosts had simply slid underground, and her mother's warning was perhaps designed to protect her less against scepticism than unhealthy interest. The name of Hellish Nell, however, had nothing to do with preternatural abilities: she got it because she was a noisy, boisterous tomboy. But as she grew up, she developed what Gaskill describes as a \"crippling diffidence, timidity and passivity, punctuated by sudden outbursts of hysterical rage\". It was a passivity which allowed her to be strip-searched before her s\u00e9ances, tied to her chair, enveloped in sacks, sewn into shroud-like cocoons intended to prevent fraudulent limbs from emerging; which made her agree to swallow dye for test-s\u00e9ances, and allow her body cavities to be probed by doctors appointed by those who had an interest in proving that she was a cheat. One could argue, too, that it was this passivity which made her choose her trade in the first place, made her earn her living as the mouthpiece of dead people: travelling the roads of Britain, sustained by tea and endless cigarettes, her parasitic husband in tow, her paying public always fresh and expectant, the thought of her needy children ever in mind, and her heavy body always sicker, and apt to take on the sicknesses of other people. It is no wonder that the rage burst out from time to time, causing her to curse out loud, and lunge at sitters who upset her, and try to knock sceptics down with chairs. In the early 1930s, one witness described her as \"by no means a magnetic personality . . . rather a repellent one that aroused one's critical faculties\". There was nothing other-worldly about her coarse features and plain speech, and yet perhaps she was not so unattractive as the self-righteous and brutal busybodies who tried persistently to expose her. If there was money to be made from raising the dead, there was also a profit to be shown from proving the dead to be made of old newsprint and cheesecloth. With credulity on the one hand, bigotry on the other, and greed everywhere, the history of spiritualism shows humanity in an unedifying light. The town where Helen grew up was a poor community, with low wages and high unemployment. The average age at which women married was 26, which attests to the difficulty of setting up a separate household; the choice for many men was between migration and emigration. When the Great War broke out, the boys queued down the street to join up. But Hellish Nell, 16-years-old, pregnant and disgraced, had already been banished to Dundee, and would seldom return to Callander. In Dundee she lived in a working-woman's hostel and worked in a jute mill. She applied for munitions work, but was found to have TB, and sent to a sanatorium. Discharged, she took a post as an auxiliary at Dundee Royal Infirmary, where the sights and sounds of the psychiatric wing worked on what was already, no doubt, a morbid imagination. Her baby was a girl, and would be the first of eight children. Helen's pregnancies were perilous, and some of her children had birth defects. She suffered from a complex of conditions which exacerbated each other: she was hypertensive and diabetic, had kidney damage, and suffered from pleurisy and abdominal pains, which cannot have been helped by her self-punishing habit of ingesting carpet tacks and cigarette ends; it was not just her audience who swallowed rubbish. Her husband, Henry Duncan, was a Dundee boy who enlisted at 16. His very poor family had a history of hauntings, and Henry seems to have been superstitious, sensitive and intelligent. Later, he would become the theroretician, while Helen attended to the practical business of raising spooks. Most mediums were women, and the men - with revered exceptions like the great Victorian DD Home - were seedy after-thoughts with inferior talents. There was perhaps something degradingly feminine in the pursuit, in the helplessness, the physical indignity of being the plaything of the deceased; gifted men preferred to be impresarios, and manage their talented wives. Henry Duncan emerges from Gaskill's account as a manipulator and a liar, but his early life was sad beyond bearing. Invalided out of the Army with rheumatic fever, he would never regain good health. He met Helen through his sister, who was a workmate of hers, and they had no doubt that they were soul mates. They married in 1916, and their early years together were wretched, with one or other of them too sick to work, though Henry took on casual labouring where it was offered and Nell would turn her hand to anything. Henry started a furniture business which failed, seemingly not through his own fault; he had a heart attack, and Helen engaged herself to crippling work in the bleach-fields to feed them, at the same time taking in washing and mending, and organising the sale of stock to pay the creditors. In the end Henry became too ill to work, and spent his time reading spiritualist books; though Helen was widely known to be psychic, she had not yet embraced - if she ever did - the corpus of cult belief. Spiritualism thrived on disaster, and on poverty. The comfort of 'proved survival' was superior to the airy assurances, given over the years by the orthodox churches, that the deficits of this life would be repaired in the next. For the working classes it had this advantage: it did not operate de haut en bas. A practising and proficient medium was likely to arise in any stratum of society, and if you lived in one of Britain's cities you were likely to find one a few streets away. Spiritualism was a neighbourly, engrossing business, offering a particular and home-grown comfort. It thrived in the Mechanics Institutes and the philanthropic and self-improvement societies of the industrial towns. The great war gave it impetus: all kinds of occult belief flourished, among the fighting forces and among civilians. In the trenches, among men facing death minute by minute, chance incidents were blown up and acquired a magical dimension. When death is dealt out so randomly, the notion of cause and effect is lost. Phenomena like the 'Angel of Mons', invented by a popular writer, were subsequently 'seen' by thousands of soldiers. Peace brought little respite to the bereaved imagination. It was as if there was a widespread feeling that somewhere, just out of reach, the young men were still alive. Returning spirits were always in favour of world peace and brotherhood; they were never bellicose or revengeful. Trite though their messages were, one can hear in them the voices of the living, battered by disaster, pitchforked into quarrels of their masters' making. Where did the revolutionary impulse go, in British society? In the 18th century it went to sing hymns at Methodist meetings; in 1917, to bawl spiritualist anthems and sit tight, once again, in the hope of a fair deal in the hereafter. A great strength of Gaskill's book is that it provides, by the way, a piece of working-class history: he makes spiritualism comprehensible in the context of the utter bleakness of the lives he describes. The night Henry Duncan's mother died - a diabetic, worn out, an old woman at 40 - Henry and Nell saw her disembodied hand tapping at their window; they recognised it by the marks of her trade, the scars across her palm made by her herring-gutter's knife. The bitterness of imagination that could give rise to such an image, the poverty that bred it, the pity it inspires: all these are part of Helen Duncan's story, and part of a common story which suggests a hunger for consolation which only a new religion could assuage. If the context is tragic, however, the daily practice of spiritualism was a theatrical spectacle that, as Gaskill says, drew on 'farce, burlesque and vaudeville'. Spiritualism, in its modern form, began in 1848 in upstate New York, where the teenage Fox sisters heard rapping noises in their farmhouse, found human bones in their cellar, and soon afterwards struck a deal with the showman Phineas T Barnum. Gaskill has a whole catalogue of comic and grotesque manifestations which could only have fooled the most suggestible of sitters, or those determined to get value for money. Performing mediums were hated by magicians and illusionists who, having laboriously copied their feats, would expose them as frauds; some of these illusionists, like Houdini, were disaffected believers for whom the spirits had declined to perform. It would be natural to assume that the spiritualist movement was a branch of the music-hall, a low-class amusement, reactive even: washed in on a tide of irrationality, lapping against the stony convictions of Victorian science. But, as Gaskill describes, the opposite case is true: the rise of spiritualism coincided with the high point of scientific materialism, and the assumptions of one creed fed the other. Continue",

Bristol crown court was told that Private Thomas Myers's comment was overheard by a doorman at Reflections nightclub in Westbury, Wiltshire, not long before railway worker Glyne Agard, 34, was found dead in the nearby club car park. Mr Agard had multiple head injuries. His brother Stephen, 33, and friend Gary Belgrave, were also seriously injured in the attack, which occurred just after 2am on June 18 last year. Myers, 20, and Privates Wayne King, 20, and Marc Hunter, 18, and Lance Corporal David White, 23, of the Green Howards Regiment based at Battlesbury Barracks, Warminster, are all charged with murder. John Royce QC, prosecuting, told the jury how the three friends, all from Reading, had gone to the nightclub after watching an England v Germany football match on television. \"They left the nightclub but they never got home,\" Mr Royce said. \"Glyne Agard met his death in the nightclub car park. Stephen Agard was attacked so that he was close to coma, and Gary Belgrave was also attacked so that he sustained a number of serious injuries.\" He told the court the \"action\" had taken place \"rapidly\" as people were leaving the club. It was alleged that the incident was triggered by a young woman complaining to King, Myers and Hunter of a minor assault by a black man that she said had taken place inside the club. King was then alleged to have said: \"It's not on. You can't hit a woman. We are going to sort it out\". Minutes later, the court was told, Glyne Agard came out of the club followed by his brother and friend. A discussion ensued between the two groups about who was responsible for the alleged assault, during which Glyne Agard denied any part in the incident. It was as he walked away with the other two men that a doorman at the club heard Myers say: \"We will give that black bastard a good kicking,\" Mr Royce said. The nightclub doorman said the soldiers then went towards the car park. He said two of them looked back, giving an intimidating stare to the black men as they left. Mr Royce told the jury they would hear conflicting versions of what happened next over the course of the trial because the events took place so quickly, and because the action moved from place to place However he told the court: \"There is no doubt that Glyne Agard was viciously attacked. Mr King appears to have been at the forefront of that to start with. And indeed he later told police: 'I lost my temper. I ran over and hit the man. I head butted him and punched him twice'.\" King is also alleged to have told police he saw someone kick Mr Agard as he tried to get up from the ground. The jury were shown CCTV footage of the incident, frame by frame, but Mr Royce warned that the time lapse on the film and the rotation of the camera meant the footage would not give a full picture of what took place. He went on: \"The attack on Glyne Agard rapidly led to both Stephen and Gary coming across to where he was and the fighting moved down to the lower car park. \"The three black men were in effect left on the ground with injuries,\" he said. \"Gary Belgrave suffered serious facial injuries and Stephen Agard was left close to coma after the attack.\" He said Glyne Agard had died as a result of a number of blows to the head which, in combination with the alcohol he had consumed, led to his death. He then told the court how, after the attack, King had allegedly boasted of his actions, saying: \"I have done all three of them.\" King was then prevented from leaving the scene in a taxi with Hunter and Myers by a doorman, he said. \"Far from expressing concern or regret about the black men, one of whom was dead, here was Mr King trumpeting what he had done\". Myers had not made any comments to police and Hunter had told officers he had tried to get Myers to leave but had failed, and then watched events unfold from a waiting taxi, Mr Royce said. The court then heard that White had told police his recollection of events had not been good because he had been drunk, but that he remembered trying to split two people up. All four soldiers are also charged with violent disorder. King, Myers and Hunter are charged with causing both Stephen Agard and Gary Belgrave grievous bodily harm with intent. The trial continues.",

His 1983 attempt to amalgamate Reading and Oxford and create the Thames Valley Royals sparked mass public protests which proved fans can stop businessmen in their tracks if they need to. Maxwell's scheme was foiled, and the die was cast: similar merger-mad oafs who've tried it on since have been told to sling their hooks. So thanks Bob, you fat bastard, because plans are afoot to merge QPR with Wimbledon - and we've got an idea!</p> <p>Earlier today, Rangers confirmed that they are in \"very early stage discussions\" with the Dons about a possible link-up, which would see Dons boss Terry Burton coach a team playing in front of crowds of 00,000 at Loftus Road. \"Our initial view is that, in the current financial environment for football outside the Premier League, the idea could have merit and may be worth exploring further,\" the spokesperson explained. \"But we must emphasise that it is still very early days. The talks with Wimbledon will only continue if there is general approval from our supporter base.\" Also making a promise we can hold him to, is Wimbledon chairman Charles Koppel. \"If the fans felt that this was not the best thing,\" he said today, \"we would re-evaluate and move along a different route.\"</p> <p>Which should mean that nothing will happen, because it's already kicking off nicely on the frontline. \"Any move to merge QPR with Wimbledon this year, or at any stage in the future, will be opposed by every possible means,\" promised Libby Magrill, spokeswoman for the QPR Supporters Trust. The Wimbledon Independent Supporters' Association, meanwhile, \"unequivocally oppose the merger of two separate identities, families, supporters and histories\".

      "bodyText": "KICK UP A STINK AND THEY CAN'T MAKE THE LINK Fat footpad Robert Maxwell may not have done much good in the time he waddled this earth, but the pug-ugly pickpocketer did at least do one beneficial thing before his unctuous frame oozed off the side of his boat and slicked into the sea. His 1983 attempt to amalgamate Reading and Oxford and create the Thames Valley Royals sparked mass public protests which proved fans can stop businessmen in their tracks if they need to. Maxwell's scheme was foiled, and the die was cast: similar merger-mad oafs who've tried it on since have been told to sling their hooks. So thanks Bob, you fat bastard, because plans are afoot to merge QPR with Wimbledon - and we've got an idea! Earlier today, Rangers confirmed that they are in \"very early stage discussions\" with the Dons about a possible link-up, which would see Dons boss Terry Burton coach a team playing in front of crowds of 00,000 at Loftus Road. \"Our initial view is that, in the current financial environment for football outside the Premier League, the idea could have merit and may be worth exploring further,\" the spokesperson explained. \"But we must emphasise that it is still very early days. The talks with Wimbledon will only continue if there is general approval from our supporter base.\" Also making a promise we can hold him to, is Wimbledon chairman Charles Koppel. \"If the fans felt that this was not the best thing,\" he said today, \"we would re-evaluate and move along a different route.\" Which should mean that nothing will happen, because it's already kicking off nicely on the frontline. \"Any move to merge QPR with Wimbledon this year, or at any stage in the future, will be opposed by every possible means,\" promised Libby Magrill, spokeswoman for the QPR Supporters Trust. The Wimbledon Independent Supporters' Association, meanwhile, \"unequivocally oppose the merger of two separate identities, families, supporters and histories\". There's even good news from the City, where an unidentified consortium are preparing a \u00a312m bid to save Rangers and jigger the scheme.

      "body": "<p>The current foot and mouth epidemic has been a more \"national\" disease than the 1967 outbreak, a government report said today.</p> <p>In 1967 94% of infected farms were in the north-west Midlands and north Wales. The major clusters this year have been located over a wider area, stretching from just north of the Scottish border to Devon.</p> <p>The report says that the geographical dispersal of the disease before the first case was diagnosed was much more widespread than in 1967. It also points to changes in the livestock industry, which have meant a much greater movement of animals than 30 years ago.</p> <p>The lack of control over sheep movements has meant that \"the same animal can be moved several times in a few days\".</p> <p>However, the report insists that the slaughter policy and the speed with which resources were mobilised compares favourably to 1967.</p> <p>Then, the armed forces were called in after 12 days. This time, according to the report, contacts were established between the ministries of agriculture and defence on the day the outbreak was detected.</p> <p>\"The more careful preparation for military deployments ensured that many of the difficulties experienced in 1967, in integrating the military and civil response, were not repeated this time round,\" it says.</p> <p>In 11 weeks, 2,382,000 animals have been slaughtered at a peak rate of more than 500,000 a week.</p> <p>In addition, 15,000 vehicles have been used to combat the outbreak. The tonnage of carcasses moved each week is now greater than that of all the ammunition transported by the British forces during the Gulf War.</p> <p>Burial sites for carcasses equal to 200 Olympic-size swimming pools have been excavated, with the mass burial site in Thropmorton in Worcestershire alone having the capacity to hold more than 430,000 sheep.</p> <p>Nevertheless, the report concludes that its short comparison of the two epidemics is \"cursory and incomplete\".</p> <p>It says that the 1967 outbreak was probably caused by imports of infected meat, legally introduced into the animal food chain. \"It is not yet established whether the cause of the current outbreak was due to illegal actions,\" it adds.</p> <p>In 1967, 434,000 animals were culled in 32 weeks. \"The logistic operation to tackle the current outbreak is of a different scale of magnitude than the 1967-8 operation,\" it says.</p> <p><b>What's going on?</b><br><a

      "bodyText": "The current foot and mouth epidemic has been a more \"national\" disease than the 1967 outbreak, a government report said today. In 1967 94% of infected farms were in the north-west Midlands and north Wales. The major clusters this year have been located over a wider area, stretching from just north of the Scottish border to Devon. The report says that the geographical dispersal of the disease before the first case was diagnosed was much more widespread than in 1967. It also points to changes in the livestock industry, which have meant a much greater movement of animals than 30 years ago. The lack of control over sheep movements has meant that \"the same animal can be moved several times in a few days\". However, the report insists that the slaughter policy and the speed with which resources were mobilised compares favourably to 1967. Then, the armed forces were called in after 12 days. This time, according to the report, contacts were established between the ministries of agriculture and defence on the day the outbreak was detected. \"The more careful preparation for military deployments ensured that many of the difficulties experienced in 1967, in integrating the military and civil response, were not repeated this time round,\" it says. In 11 weeks, 2,382,000 animals have been slaughtered at a peak rate of more than 500,000 a week. In addition, 15,000 vehicles have been used to combat the outbreak. The tonnage of carcasses moved each week is now greater than that of all the ammunition transported by the British forces during the Gulf War. Burial sites for carcasses equal to 200 Olympic-size swimming pools have been excavated, with the mass burial site in Thropmorton in Worcestershire alone having the capacity to hold more than 430,000 sheep. Nevertheless, the report concludes that its short comparison of the two epidemics is \"cursory and incomplete\". It says that the 1967 outbreak was probably caused by imports of infected meat, legally introduced into the animal food chain. \"It is not yet established whether the cause of the current outbreak was due to illegal actions,\" it adds. In 1967, 434,000 animals were culled in 32 weeks. \"The logistic operation to tackle the current outbreak is of a different scale of magnitude than the 1967-8 operation,\" it says. What's going on?

      "body": "<p>A select audience crammed into the small impromptu theatre watches as the lead character in the play battles against her addiction to drink and drugs, tries to help her new boyfriend fight his own war against alcoholism and has to cope with the threats of her dealing ex-lover.</p> <p>Suddenly, a voice from the audience is contradicting the actor bringing some of his own life experience to the fictional dilemmas on stage. Eventually, he gets up on stage and takes over one of the main roles himself.</p> <p>This would be considered a disaster for most theatre companies. But for Outside Edge it is a normal night's work, using theatre to help recovering addicts and alcoholics confront their problems. </p> <p>The company is the brainchild of Philip Fox, an actor who 16 years ago found his life was being destroyed by his addiction to heroin, cocaine and alcohol. \"I saw that theatre was something that kept me alive,\" he said.</p> <p>After overcoming his addictions and spending years working in community theatre, he started devising plans for a theatre group to help other recovering addicts and alcoholics come to terms with their problems. </p> <p>Outside Edge has now been touring rehabilitation centres and prisons since 1999. The actors are all recovering alcoholics or ex-drug addicts. Their specially-devised plays deal specifically with the problems recovering addicts face every day.</p> <p>The troupe performs a one-hour play, then runs through it again. The second time around the audience is encouraged to stop the actors and provide their own input into what is happening on stage - even to the point of getting up and taking over the roles themselves.</p> <p>\"It is stunning how well that can work,\" said Mr Fox. \"Our audiences can be full of rage and they have to get up to have their say.\"</p> <p>Dave Mulvaney, manager of the Self Help Recovery Project (Sharp) in London, which has put on Outside Edge productions for its clients, said: \"It is very useful, because it's a very creative medium to deliver relapse prevention therapy. It is alive and powerful and impacts on all the dynamics - family, work, the violence of growing up - all major issues in these people's lives.\"</p> <p>John Gordon Smith, head of the drug and alcohol team at Hammersmith and Fulham council, was an early champion of the company and is now on its board of trustees. He says: \"It's great to have these plays that people can come along to and see aspects of their own lives. It's a play, but on the other hand it is also an active dialogue on what people have gone through. It actively takes them to a different level.\"</p> <p>Barry Maher was a recovering alcoholic and a drama school student when he went along to see an early production. \"I was only six months out of treatment, so it was all still fresh for me,\" he said. \"It was the first time I'd seen anything like my own experiences on stage like that.\"</p> <p>He went on to audition for the company and is now a regular member of Outside Edge. \"The second part of the show is quite improvised and you don't know what you're going to come up against. The audience can be pretty vulnerable and pretty volatile.\"</p> <p>The plays, dealing with issues such as relationships, incest and crime associated with addiction, often hit a strong nerve in the lives of the audiences, many of whom are seeing live theatre for the first time in their lives. </p> <p>In a previous production, Family Life, Mr Maher played a social worker who takes a woman's child into care. \"Some of the women who got up in the audience during that play had gone through that and they were laying into you as a character,\" he said. \"You can get shocking responses from people to what they have seen.\"</p> <p>Adam Langer was one recovering drug addict who saw Family Life while he was going through treatment with a self-help group. \"I was in floods of tears,\" he said. \"You go and see a play that has no pretensions, no preaching, but just shows you what your home and your life was like. That is incredibly powerful.\"</p> <p>For Mr Langer, now clean for two years, the company has a valuable role to play in any rehabilitation programme. </p> <p>\"In places like prisons and treatment centres, the hardest thing for people is to be vulnerable, to get in touch with what is inside you. But this work is so overwhelmingly in your face, it just breaks through that denial and it is an incredibly useful tool.\"</p> <p>\"What is important is that people with addictions are not used to playing with different roles,\" said Mr Fox. \"They're stuck in the role of the addict. The plays get them to rehearse other roles, to see things from a different perspective.\"</p> <p>\u0095 Outside Edge take their latest production, Harry and Susie Get Married? on tour around England in May, telephone: 020 7371 8020 for details.</p>",

      "bodyText": "A select audience crammed into the small impromptu theatre watches as the lead character in the play battles against her addiction to drink and drugs, tries to help her new boyfriend fight his own war against alcoholism and has to cope with the threats of her dealing ex-lover. Suddenly, a voice from the audience is contradicting the actor bringing some of his own life experience to the fictional dilemmas on stage. Eventually, he gets up on stage and takes over one of the main roles himself. This would be considered a disaster for most theatre companies. But for Outside Edge it is a normal night's work, using theatre to help recovering addicts and alcoholics confront their problems. The company is the brainchild of Philip Fox, an actor who 16 years ago found his life was being destroyed by his addiction to heroin, cocaine and alcohol. \"I saw that theatre was something that kept me alive,\" he said. After overcoming his addictions and spending years working in community theatre, he started devising plans for a theatre group to help other recovering addicts and alcoholics come to terms with their problems. Outside Edge has now been touring rehabilitation centres and prisons since 1999. The actors are all recovering alcoholics or ex-drug addicts. Their specially-devised plays deal specifically with the problems recovering addicts face every day. The troupe performs a one-hour play, then runs through it again. The second time around the audience is encouraged to stop the actors and provide their own input into what is happening on stage - even to the point of getting up and taking over the roles themselves. \"It is stunning how well that can work,\" said Mr Fox. \"Our audiences can be full of rage and they have to get up to have their say.\" Dave Mulvaney, manager of the Self Help Recovery Project (Sharp) in London, which has put on Outside Edge productions for its clients, said: \"It is very useful, because it's a very creative medium to deliver relapse prevention therapy. It is alive and powerful and impacts on all the dynamics - family, work, the violence of growing up - all major issues in these people's lives.\" John Gordon Smith, head of the drug and alcohol team at Hammersmith and Fulham council, was an early champion of the company and is now on its board of trustees. He says: \"It's great to have these plays that people can come along to and see aspects of their own lives. It's a play, but on the other hand it is also an active dialogue on what people have gone through. It actively takes them to a different level.\" Barry Maher was a recovering alcoholic and a drama school student when he went along to see an early production. \"I was only six months out of treatment, so it was all still fresh for me,\" he said. \"It was the first time I'd seen anything like my own experiences on stage like that.\" He went on to audition for the company and is now a regular member of Outside Edge. \"The second part of the show is quite improvised and you don't know what you're going to come up against. The audience can be pretty vulnerable and pretty volatile.\" The plays, dealing with issues such as relationships, incest and crime associated with addiction, often hit a strong nerve in the lives of the audiences, many of whom are seeing live theatre for the first time in their lives. In a previous production, Family Life, Mr Maher played a social worker who takes a woman's child into care. \"Some of the women who got up in the audience during that play had gone through that and they were laying into you as a character,\" he said. \"You can get shocking responses from people to what they have seen.\" Adam Langer was one recovering drug addict who saw Family Life while he was going through treatment with a self-help group. \"I was in floods of tears,\" he said. \"You go and see a play that has no pretensions, no preaching, but just shows you what your home and your life was like. That is incredibly powerful.\" For Mr Langer, now clean for two years, the company has a valuable role to play in any rehabilitation programme. \"In places like prisons and treatment centres, the hardest thing for people is to be vulnerable, to get in touch with what is inside you. But this work is so overwhelmingly in your face, it just breaks through that denial and it is an incredibly useful tool.\" \"What is important is that people with addictions are not used to playing with different roles,\" said Mr Fox. \"They're stuck in the role of the addict. The plays get them to rehearse other roles, to see things from a different perspective.\" \u0095 Outside Edge take their latest production, Harry and Susie Get Married? on tour around England in May, telephone: 020 7371 8020 for details.",

      "body": "<p>Trevor Penney organised Warwickshire's pursuit of a modest total to beat Somerset yesterday, finishing a pugnacious, well-paced and undefeated innings of 73 by pulling the first ball of the final over backward of square to the boundary. </p> <p>It was bowled by Marcus Trescothick, captaining Somerset while Jamie Cox nurses a groin strain. The win erased the memory of the previous day, when Warwickshire had been mugged by Gloucestershire off the last ball of the match and Somerset had crushed Glamorgan. </p> <p>On a pitch offering some early life, and with the ever-present but unfulfilled threat of rain, the visitors chose to bowl first. Although Trescothick shone briefly, any Somerset hopes of setting a demanding target were stifled when Vasbert Drakes and, above all, Melvyn Betts reduced the hosts to 44 for five. Betts, newly recruited from Durham, bowled unchanged with fire and imagination to return his best one-day figures of four for 22, which won him the gold award. </p> <p>In support, Mohammed Sheikh showed once again that he has a promising ability as a one-day bowler. Of no more than medium pace, and with no great lift off the pitch, he spears the ball into the batsman and allows no liberties. </p> <p>The fact that Somerset could recover enough from the Betts assault to make Warwickshire work for victory was almost entirely due to Keith Parsons. Although as substantially built as a Somerset farmer, the Taunton-born Parsons does not bully the ball in the style of west country smiters such as Arthur Wellard or Ian Botham. He prefers the nudge, the deflection, the placement. With Richard Johnson he coaxed 47 for the ninth wicket. </p> <p>But the game is a cruel one. With Warwickshire running away with it, Trescothick gave himself an over.

      "bodyText": "Trevor Penney organised Warwickshire's pursuit of a modest total to beat Somerset yesterday, finishing a pugnacious, well-paced and undefeated innings of 73 by pulling the first ball of the final over backward of square to the boundary. It was bowled by Marcus Trescothick, captaining Somerset while Jamie Cox nurses a groin strain. The win erased the memory of the previous day, when Warwickshire had been mugged by Gloucestershire off the last ball of the match and Somerset had crushed Glamorgan. On a pitch offering some early life, and with the ever-present but unfulfilled threat of rain, the visitors chose to bowl first. Although Trescothick shone briefly, any Somerset hopes of setting a demanding target were stifled when Vasbert Drakes and, above all, Melvyn Betts reduced the hosts to 44 for five. Betts, newly recruited from Durham, bowled unchanged with fire and imagination to return his best one-day figures of four for 22, which won him the gold award. In support, Mohammed Sheikh showed once again that he has a promising ability as a one-day bowler. Of no more than medium pace, and with no great lift off the pitch, he spears the ball into the batsman and allows no liberties. The fact that Somerset could recover enough from the Betts assault to make Warwickshire work for victory was almost entirely due to Keith Parsons. Although as substantially built as a Somerset farmer, the Taunton-born Parsons does not bully the ball in the style of west country smiters such as Arthur Wellard or Ian Botham. He prefers the nudge, the deflection, the placement. With Richard Johnson he coaxed 47 for the ninth wicket. But the game is a cruel one. With Warwickshire running away with it, Trescothick gave himself an over. His first ball was a wide long hop, but Mike Powell obligingly smashed it high and straight to Parsons at backward gully, where it was juggled and spilled. Parsons made some amends first by catching Powell and then by taking Neil Smith in a carbon copy of the missed opportunity, but by then Warwickshire were almost home. Earlier in the visitors' reply Steffan Jones, forming a useful opening attack with Johnson in the absence of Andy Caddick, had given Somerset some hope with three cheap wickets, and when Powell joined Penney Warwickshire were four down for 71. But Powell, the newly appointed captain, played with fitting responsibility in a stand that put on 70 match-winning runs. \u0095 It rained on the Rose Bowl parade. The opening game at Hampshire's \u00a317m stadium, the Benson &amp; Hedges Cup match against Essex, was cancelled 90 minutes before the start and the ground is so sodden that tomorrow's fixture with Surrey is already in doubt.",

She takes my husband outside to explain quite how bad it is down there.

She prods it regularly over the next few days to see that it is doing this and that I have not retained any of the placenta, and presumably, to rule out any lingering foetuses. </p> <p><strong> Six hours </strong><br> </p> <p> Still haven't dared get up. It feels like someone has snuck in and battered my parts with a baseball bat. Fortunately, my baby is a great distraction. </p> <p><strong> Seven hours </strong><br> </p> <p> Catheter is removed and I am guided to the bathroom to \"get cleaned up\". The bed looks like a scene from The Godfather and I look and move like Frankenstein's monster. My legs shake and ache. My head is light. I have the distinct impression that my intestines and colon are going to fall out of my vagina. But, fortunately, I am still euphoric at having produced an actual baby. I daren't sit down in the bath and I watch in dismay as a lot of blood goes everywhere. The nurse rubs me down like I'm a horse, and gives me a pad that would be adequate for one. She also gives me a pair of paper knickers. They have small pink sprigs on them, a nice touch. </p> <p><strong> Day one </strong><br> </p> <p> I have to recline, since sitting feels life-threateningly painful. I refuse to look down there and also refuse to let my husband look as I don't want him to retain this image. He thinks I'm mad, as he saw the baby come out. My stomach is still inflated. My shoulders, oddly, ache as if I've carried a piano around for several days. My breasts are producing weird pale liquid called colostrum, that my baby laps up round the clock but other than this they don't feel any different. I have been given \"stool softener\" pills but apparently may not be able to \"go\" for quite some time. </p> <p><strong> Day two </strong><br> </p> <p> I am still having painful \"contractions\". This is my womb shrinking and shouldn't persist. Walking out of the hospital is a challenge. I have to stick my bum out and take tiny steps like an ancient tribal dancer. I am dismayed that I look heavily pregnant. I am unable to sit down in the car and have to perch, one cheek on the side of the seat, swearing. </p> <p><strong> Day three </strong><br> </p> <p> I now see the need for stool softener and can confirm that it has failed. I am genuinely alarmed by my piles. Can still barely move, let alone sit down. My boobs have inflated to the size and texture of medicine balls; my nipples are bright red and sore. Exhaustion. I keep crying. The pregnancy book explains that this is a normal hormonal day-three thing - my oestrogen and progesterone levels have \"dropped precipitously\". I cannot see an evolutionary need for this. The authors suggests my husband gets us a nice takeaway. Lots of blood. Oh, and I'm incontinent and fat. Apart from that, motherhood is a breeze. </p> <p><strong> Day four </strong><br> </p> <p> My husband finally insists on taking a look at my parts. I am sure he'll never want me again, but right now couldn't care less. He claims - to my astonishment - that they look almost normal. I know he is lying because when I move I can feel the wind whistling up there and things flapping. Also, the midwife told me she put in purple stitches. Love is a wonderful thing. </p> <p> <strong> Week two </strong><br> </p> <p> Still incontinent. Still fat. Breastfeeding is hell. My baby eats at least once an hour (what happened to \"four-hourly schedules\"?) My nipples are cracked. I am variously engorged and completely milk-free. And I now have a suspicious red, painful lump on one breast. The midwife says it's a \"blocked duct\" and I should massage it and steam it. A day later, the whole side of the boob is red and enflamed and feels like someone is sticking hot knives into it. I have a fever. Midwife diagnoses mastitis - an infection of the milk ducts - and prescribes rest (ha), steaming them over a pan of hot water, massage and antibiotics. </p> <p><strong> Week three </strong><br> </p> <p> The mastitis takes three days of agony and gradually dissipating fever and four more of low-grade pain to disperse. And I have to keep breastfeeding through the pain. I can now walk, but after any time on my feet I feel, again, that someone has battered my perineum with a hard object. </p> <p><strong> Week six </strong><br> </p> <p> My book talks about \"easing back into sex\". One of the tips is \"don't be discouraged by pain\". Hello? My hair is falling out and I am two stone overweight. My stretch marks are angry red and my belly looks like a crumpled, partially deflated balloon. I tried to do some pelvic floor exercises but was unable to locate a single responsive muscle. I have also just noticed another red lump on the same breast. Sexy? </p> <p><strong> Week seven </strong><br> </p> <p> Another week, another bout of mastitis, course of antibiotics. Fretful baby. I have been told that his elephantine wind problem could be a result of dairy produce in my diet and so have cut it out. He is still farting and writhing. I have had no sleep and am depressed. My health visitor gives me a questionnaire to check whether I have post-natal depression. Apparently not. My depression is, she says, \"normal\". </p> <p><strong> Week eight </strong><br> </p> <p> Life is, at last, looking up. The piles have almost gone. I can now walk for half an hour without pain but my bladder control is dodgy. However, I slept for three consecutive hours two nights in a row and I managed to faintly twitch my pelvic floor yesterday. Still exhausted. Still fat. But my baby smiles now as well as farts. Which somehow makes it all worthwhile. Sort of.</p>",

Day one I have to recline, since sitting feels life-threateningly painful. I refuse to look down there and also refuse to let my husband look as I don't want him to retain this image. He thinks I'm mad, as he saw the baby come out. My stomach is still inflated. My shoulders, oddly, ache as if I've carried a piano around for several days. My breasts are producing weird pale liquid called colostrum, that my baby laps up round the clock but other than this they don't feel any different. I have been given \"stool softener\" pills but apparently may not be able to \"go\" for quite some time. Day two I am still having painful \"contractions\". This is my womb shrinking and shouldn't persist. Walking out of the hospital is a challenge. I have to stick my bum out and take tiny steps like an ancient tribal dancer. I am dismayed that I look heavily pregnant. I am unable to sit down in the car and have to perch, one cheek on the side of the seat, swearing. Day three I now see the need for stool softener and can confirm that it has failed. I am genuinely alarmed by my piles. Can still barely move, let alone sit down. My boobs have inflated to the size and texture of medicine balls; my nipples are bright red and sore. Exhaustion. I keep crying. The pregnancy book explains that this is a normal hormonal day-three thing - my oestrogen and progesterone levels have \"dropped precipitously\". I cannot see an evolutionary need for this. The authors suggests my husband gets us a nice takeaway. Lots of blood. Oh, and I'm incontinent and fat. Apart from that, motherhood is a breeze. Day four My husband finally insists on taking a look at my parts. I am sure he'll never want me again, but right now couldn't care less. He claims - to my astonishment - that they look almost normal. I know he is lying because when I move I can feel the wind whistling up there and things flapping. Also, the midwife told me she put in purple stitches. Love is a wonderful thing. Week two Still incontinent. Still fat. Breastfeeding is hell. My baby eats at least once an hour (what happened to \"four-hourly schedules\"?) My nipples are cracked. I am variously engorged and completely milk-free. And I now have a suspicious red, painful lump on one breast. The midwife says it's a \"blocked duct\" and I should massage it and steam it. A day later, the whole side of the boob is red and enflamed and feels like someone is sticking hot knives into it. I have a fever. Midwife diagnoses mastitis - an infection of the milk ducts - and prescribes rest (ha), steaming them over a pan of hot water, massage and antibiotics. Week three The mastitis takes three days of agony and gradually dissipating fever and four more of low-grade pain to disperse. And I have to keep breastfeeding through the pain. I can now walk, but after any time on my feet I feel, again, that someone has battered my perineum with a hard object. Week six My book talks about \"easing back into sex\". One of the tips is \"don't be discouraged by pain\". Hello? My hair is falling out and I am two stone overweight. My stretch marks are angry red and my belly looks like a crumpled, partially deflated balloon. I tried to do some pelvic floor exercises but was unable to locate a single responsive muscle. I have also just noticed another red lump on the same breast. Sexy? Week seven Another week, another bout of mastitis, course of antibiotics. Fretful baby. I have been told that his elephantine wind problem could be a result of dairy produce in my diet and so have cut it out. He is still farting and writhing. I have had no sleep and am depressed. My health visitor gives me a questionnaire to check whether I have post-natal depression. Apparently not. My depression is, she says, \"normal\". Week eight Life is, at last, looking up. The piles have almost gone. I can now walk for half an hour without pain but my bladder control is dodgy. However, I slept for three consecutive hours two nights in a row and I managed to faintly twitch my pelvic floor yesterday. Still exhausted. Still fat. But my baby smiles now as well as farts. Which somehow makes it all worthwhile. Sort of.",

Taylor, 27, was simply brushing her teeth. \"It sounds ridiculous, but I used to bring a toothbrush and toothpaste into work with me,\" she says, looking a little shamefaced. \"I simply couldn't be without them. I used to brush my teeth about 10 times a day. I also chewed gum the whole time because I was sure I had bad breath. I hated being in lifts with people and worried about travelling on the tube.

It aims to help those deluded souls who are convinced, wrongly, that they have bad breath. </p> <p>Dr Philip Stemmer, clinical director of the Fresh Breath Centre, a specialist oral hygiene practice in London, and the driving force behind Halitophobics Anonymous, claims that an astonishing 1% of the British population (650,000 of us) have halitophobia in \"one form or another\". He says that he set up the group because he noticed that many people who sought his help did not need it, at least for their breath. </p> <p>\"Halitophobia is a condition whereby people think they have halitosis when they haven't, or imagine they have enormous problems when they only have very minor ones,\" says Stemmer. \"It is not a new problem, but it has only recently been recognised.\" </p> <p>It is almost impossible to detect your own bad breath and this fuels the anxiety, which can lead to a pre-occupation with tooth-brushing, gum-chewing or mint-sucking. In a society in which we are under constant pressure to look and smell good, halitosis is about as desirable as foot and mouth disease. This is despite the fact that research suggests 98% of us have bad breath - usually caused by bacteria which coat the teeth and gums - at some point in our lives. </p> <p>\"Phobias are very common,\" says Cosmo Hallstrom, a consultant psychiatrist and medical director of the Florence Nightingale clinic in Chelsea, London. \"They are mostly minor but can get out of control. The problem occurs when you start trying to avoid your phobia. You need to confront it or it will get worse. </p> <p>\"I think there is a propensity in all of us to develop particular phobias at certain times in life. Halitophobia could develop quite innocently, through a minor breath problem. They try to avoid it and take a mint. Then they want something stronger and start brushing their teeth a lot, but it is never quite enough. The phobia builds up and takes over. For example, they may be rejected by a partner and blame that on the bad breath they think they have. Life gets miserable and they blame their breath.\" </p> <p>Blaming misfortune on bad breath is exactly what Joe Wallace did. He had never been unduly concerned about his breath until an argument with his daughter. \"I can't even remember what the argument was about now,\" says Wallace, 45. \"But I do remember that she told me not to shout at her because I stank. I was devastated and couldn't understand why no one had ever told me before.\" </p> <p>His wife said their daughter was just \"winding him up\" but it was too late. \"I started chewing gum a lot, which drove my wife mad,\" he says. \"I also noticed people watching me on the tube. Perhaps it was because my constant chewing was annoying, but I was convinced that it was because the gum wasn't properly masking my breath.\" </p> <p>Two dentists told Wallace his breath was fine. \"It didn't help,\" he says. \"I was really sensitive. I was having a bad time at work and began thinking it was because I was making other people's lives a misery by breathing on them. I started to cover my mouth when I talked.\" </p> <p>The crunch came when Wallace lost his job. He sank into a depression and convinced himself that his problems were all due to his (non-existent) halitosis. </p> <p>\"Eventually my doctor sent me to a psychiatrist for my depression,\" he says. \"Luckily she realised I needed to see someone for the phobia and I went to a psychologist. I now feel much more confident.\" </p> <p>There are many different kinds of phobia, - whether irrational fear of objects, situations, or creatures. Most common are social phobias such as fear of public speaking or heights, and fear of animals or insects (often snakes and spiders). </p> <p>Some people also have a fear of their own body odour, or suffer from dysmorphia, also known as \"imagined ugliness syndrome\", which makes them obsessed with a perceived defect in their appearance. Halitophobia simply hasn't been discussed seriously before. </p> <p>Taylor had never had any sort of phobia until a friend asked her if she had brushed her teeth one day. \"It hit a nerve. I probably did have bad breath, but that comment gave me a problem that was psychological rather than medical,\" she says. It took years before another friend told Taylor she couldn't spend her life brushing her teeth.

      "body": "<p><strong> Morning sickness </strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Q</strong> I am six weeks pregnant and being very sick. I have tried homeopathy, acupuncture, yoga, eating all the time, not eating all the time, hot water - nothing works. My GP said I can take an antihistamine that is safe in pregnancy and will help the nausea but I really don't want to take any drugs. What can I do? </p> <p><strong>A</strong> Ginger. Gingerbread or biscuits, ginger beer - anything with ginger in it. Seventy pregnant Thai women were divided into two groups. One group took a gram of ginger a day for four days, the others swallowed a placebo. The ginger group said they felt less sick and vomited less, the placebo group reported no change. </p> <p><strong> Blood group query</strong><br> </p> <p> <strong> Q</strong> I read a review of a book that purported to link blood groups with diet. The reviewer dismissed these claims but did say that there was a higher risk of developing stomach cancer if your blood group is A. Is this true? </p> <p><strong>A</strong> It is not really clear why we have different blood groups - it is assumed that in evolutionary terms having a particular blood group in a particular time and place conferred some advantage in fighting infections and surviving. The commonest blood group in the UK is O, and A is the second commonest. Any evolutionary advantage has almost certainly disappeared and we are all much of muchness from a blood-group point of view. The association between blood group A and stomach cancer is weak and dates from a time when blood group was one of the few variables that could be tested for. It is possibly still true that if you take everyone with stomach cancer, you find a slightly higher than average number of people with blood group A.

You could ask for a blood test called Paul-Bunnell which will tell you whether you have glandular fever. It is useful to know because if so, you can expect to feel off colour for a variable length of time - anything from one to several weeks, which may be important if you have exams looming.

      "bodyText": "Morning sickness Q I am six weeks pregnant and being very sick. I have tried homeopathy, acupuncture, yoga, eating all the time, not eating all the time, hot water - nothing works. My GP said I can take an antihistamine that is safe in pregnancy and will help the nausea but I really don't want to take any drugs. What can I do? A Ginger. Gingerbread or biscuits, ginger beer - anything with ginger in it. Seventy pregnant Thai women were divided into two groups. One group took a gram of ginger a day for four days, the others swallowed a placebo. The ginger group said they felt less sick and vomited less, the placebo group reported no change. Blood group query Q I read a review of a book that purported to link blood groups with diet. The reviewer dismissed these claims but did say that there was a higher risk of developing stomach cancer if your blood group is A. Is this true? A It is not really clear why we have different blood groups - it is assumed that in evolutionary terms having a particular blood group in a particular time and place conferred some advantage in fighting infections and surviving. The commonest blood group in the UK is O, and A is the second commonest. Any evolutionary advantage has almost certainly disappeared and we are all much of muchness from a blood-group point of view. The association between blood group A and stomach cancer is weak and dates from a time when blood group was one of the few variables that could be tested for. It is possibly still true that if you take everyone with stomach cancer, you find a slightly higher than average number of people with blood group A. But if you take the huge numbers of healthy people who happen to be blood group A, it is unlikely that they have a statistically higher than average chance of developing stomach, or any other, cancer.

      "bodyText": "Labour's campaign high command has ordered election candidates not to promote tactical voting after high-profile party supporters called on voters to back the Liberal Democrats to keep out Conservatives. A leaked memo from Labour's Millbank headquarters instructs candidates on a \"line to take\" against tactical voting, and describes as a \"mythology\" the widespread view that tactical votes contributed to the party's landslide victory at the last election. The order follows calls by the leftwing singer Billy Bragg for tactical agreements between Liberal Democrat and Labour supporters to oust Tory MPs in marginal seats at the coming general election, and the creation of a website linking anti-Tory tactical voters. An article in the leftwing newspaper Tribune by its former editor Paul Anderson also urged tactical votes for the Liberal Democrats, though the paper later made clear that it opposed the strategy after protests from readers. Millbank's attempt to stamp on talk of tactical voting in advance of the election will be seen as an attempt to soothe disquiet among activists concerned that a clear election message of support for Labour could be obscured. It also reflects a sense among traditional party members that Labour's significant poll lead means it no longer needs to contemplate cooperation with the Lib Dems, nor the electoral reform, leading to a system of proportional representation, sought by supporters of the Lib-Lab project. But prospective parliamentary candidates in some seats where Labour is in third place claim that many supporters are preparing again to vote Liberal Democrat to oust or keep out a Conservative. One candidate suggested early canvassing returns reflected a \"seismic shift\" to the Liberal Democrats from Labour in the south-west, reflecting last year's byelection in Romsey, Hampshire. The Lib Dems snatched the Tory seat on a 12% swing, while the Labour candidate lost his deposit. The Millbank memo of April 27, which refers to the Tribune article, tells candidates: \"Line to take: We do not endorse a campaign of tactical voting. We have Labour candidates in every seat and urge all voters to vote Labour.\" It adds: \"There is a mythology about tactical voting which would have us believe that we only won in 1997 because a lot of people voted for us who are really Liberal Democrats. \"In fact there are very few committed Liberal Democrats, their support has a huge turnover from one election to the next.

      "bodyText": "Great train robber Ronnie Biggs has told police he plans to return to Britain after 35 years on the run, Scotland Yard revealed today. Mr Biggs is prepared to face arrest when he flies into the country from his home in Rio de Janeiro. The 71-year old claimed he is in failing health after recently suffering his third stroke. Explaining his reasons for giving himself up, Mr Biggs said: \"I am a sick man. My last wish is to walk into a Margate pub as an Englishman and buy a pint of bitter. \"I hope I live long enough to do that.\" Mike Gray, who has been a pen pal of Mr Biggs for 12 years and runs RonnieBiggs.com, a website dedicated to the villain, said: \"It is something we have been talking about for the last 12 months\". Asked when Mr Biggs planned to return, he said: \"Within the week is the rumour from Brazil.\" He said that it depended on how quickly he could get a passport from the British government. Mr Biggs's one-page email, addressed to Detective Chief Superintendent John Coles, head of Scotland Yard's serious and organised crime group, read: \"To Mr John Coles, Scotland Yard, London. \"I would like to give myself up to you. What I need is passport documentation to travel back to Britain. \"I'm prepared to be arrested at the gate when I arrive at Heathrow airport to submit myself to the due process of the law.\" He also included a thumbprint, which can be linked to his police records to prove the email is genuine. The fugitive is now debt-ridden and the latest of a series of strokes has left him partially paralysed and unable to speak. \"I think it is because his health is deteriorating all the time. For the past 12 months... it has been getting worse,\" Mr Gray said. \"He has this love for England... he does not want to die in Brazil.\" He said that Biggs's son would accompany him on the flight back to Britain if the necessary documentation was obtained. Mr Biggs was part of a gang that escaped with a then record \u00a32.6m after holding up a Glasgow to London night train in 1963. The train's driver, Jack Mills, was coshed as the gang boarded the train near Cheddington, Buckinghamshire, in a robbery immortalised in the film Buster. Ronnie Biggs was sentenced to 30 years but, after only 15 months, he escaped from Wandsworth prison in south London by scaling a 25ft wall on a rope ladder and jumping into an open-top furniture van with a mattress inside. He fled abroad and settled in Brazil in 1970. His son Michael was born there, making him ineligible for extradition.

She said that the home secretary had the power to release prisoners on compassionate grounds, but that this should be used only when they are \"in imminent danger of death ... not just with an illness that will eventually result in death\".

It severely criticises four NHS trusts and the Department of Health (DoH) over the scandal and warns that hospitals up and down the country are still failing to make adequate checks when employing temporary locum doctors. Dr Peter Homa, chief executive of CHI, said: \"The continuing failure by hospitals across the country to follow basic procedures in appointing locum consultants must, inevitably, raise concerns about patient safety.

Dr Elwood had worked as a locum pathologist in three other trusts - the Royal United Hospital Bath trust, the Mid-Sussex trust and Frimley Park Hospitals trust - between 1995 and 1999. Despite concerns being raised about his performance as early as 1995, investigations did not start until 1999. In the biggest ever review of tests ever conducted, more than 10,000 diagnoses by Dr Elwood had to be rechecked. More than 200 people were found to have been wrongly diagnosed, seven of whom suffered serious consequences as a result. One woman had a breast removed unnecessarily and another patient was left in a \"life-threatening\" condition. The commission's report found that all four trusts had failed to carry out even basic checks on Dr Elwood's background and career when he came to work for them. It said: \"The four trusts failed to use adequate safeguards when employing Dr Elwood in terms of obtaining references, checking career history, in interviewing, in carrying out health checks and in his induction.\" The report was not an investigation into Dr Elwood himself, who escaped professional punishment by voluntarily erasing himself from the medical register.

The commission was strongly critical of the DoH's systems on employing elderly and locum doctors. It said there was \"too much reliance\" on locums because of chronic shortages of pathologists and \"poor workforce planning\". Trusts must seek a special order to employ doctors aged over 70, proving there is a pressing need to employ them and that they are fit to practice.

Monitoring of locum consultants was \"poor\" and DoH's code on employing locums needed to be strengthened.

The chief executive of Channel 5 described him as \"an exceptional talent\" and the \"perfect\" man to attract new viewers to the station, which recently celebrated its fourth birthday. \"Kevin Lygo is an exceptional talent who has been at the forefront of commissioning some of the most innovative and widely viewed entertainment formats of the last few years,\" said Ms Airey. \"Combine this with his start-up experience from E4 and he makes the perfect candidate to take Channel 5 into the next phase of our growth,\" she added. The Channel 4 chief executive, Michael Jackson, said he was sorry to see Mr Lygo go and praised his talent-spotting abilities. \"Kevin has completely revitalised Channel 4 entertainment and unearthed a phenomenal array of new comic talent.\" he said. \"Ali G, Trigger Happy TV, Smack the Pony, Spaced, Black Books and So Graham Norton are the best testament to the scale of his contribution at Channel 4.\" Mr Lygo launched his career in TV as a comedy scriptwriter at the BBC. He has worked on the Two Ronnies, Rowan Atkinson's satirical show Not the Nine O'Clock News and Tracey Ullman's Three of a Kind. He helped launch Terry Wogan's chat show for BBC1 a decade ago. Mr Lygo went on to become head of development for BBC entertainment and before defecting to Channel 4 headed up the department's independent producution unit responsible for Men Behaving Badly, Game on and the Frank Skinner Show. He said: \"This is a marvellous opportunity for me. I am leaving Channel 4 at a high point and I am very excited by this chance to be a part of the growing success story that is Channel 5.\" An RTL Group spokesman said: \"To get a mainstream entertainment executive like Kevin is a sign of Dawn's pulling power and the channel's ambitions.\" Related stories 03.05.2001: Lygo jumps ship for Channel 5 26.01.2001: Kevin's horoscope 15.01.2001: Countdown to E4 - Kevin's secret diary",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>If you attended a s\u00e9ance, you were not asked to open the eye of faith, but to trust your direct experience; all the senses were to be gratified and convinced. You did not have to accept the truth of the Bible or swallow sermons about the existence of a spirit world: all you had to do was turn up and pay your money, and you would see and hear for yourself. Immortality was sold as a fact, not a pious hope; it was not just the soul that went on after death, but the body and the hands and the feet. Dead fingers stretched out to touch and pat the cheeks of the living, or chalked their messages on slates, or plucked at spirit harps. Discarnate lungs puffed at wind instruments. Bouquets of roses - thornless - were 'apported' into the s\u00e9ance room, and dogs, cats, rabbits and parrots attested to the fact that the inhabitants of Victorian pet cemeteries would rise too. Sequestered behind a curtain, protected by the half-dark, the medium would pass into a trance state and soon the voices of the dead would come through, wanting to be recognised. Masks, wigs, wires, beards and rubber gloves were the props the mediums employed, and for the voices they used their native histrionic ability; a daughter of Nell's once remarked bitterly that if all her mother's manifestations were self-engendered, she was a loss to the acting profession. It was, and is, extremely difficult to reconcile the evidence of witnesses of psychic phenomena. Many s\u00e9ances were becalmed, with long stretches of non-event, so that when a sudden dramatic event did occur the sitters were not sufficiently focused to report on its nature. The same 'manifestations' could leave an audience divided, half of them sneering and half of them moved to tears.</p> <p>Helen Duncan was a classic 'materialisation medium', and central to her act was the production of ectoplasm, a substance for which there is no recipe, and which now has vanished from the world. Ectoplasm was a milky emission which gave life to spirit forms. It emanated from the medium's nose and mouth and from the area of darkness within her clothes, and took on semi-solid form, with features that the willing onlooker could recognise. One witness to a performance by Hellish Nell described it as \"a liquid spurting from the nipples of her breasts\". In giving birth to the dead, the medium is both male and female; ectoplasm is both semen and breast-milk. From time to time sitters attempted to snip or wrench or tug pieces of it away, in order to submit it to laboratory analysis. Tests were often inconclusive: it was cloth, or paper fibres bound with egg-white - or it was a substance unknown. In its most detectable form it consisted of yards of fine muslin packed within the medium's capacious undergarments, or possibly within the medium's capacious body cavities. It was often suggested that the muslin was regurgitated, and it was seriously maintained that some mediums had two stomachs. Ectoplasm smelled like old cloth; or, some said, like death. Another feature of a medium's performance was a 'spirit guide', in whose voice the medium would often speak. Nell's guide was called Albert. He was tall, and rather superior, and his favourite song was South of the Border. He spoke in a strangulated drawl, his accent veering between RP and Strine. When photographed, he looked like a rolled-up newspaper. He often ridiculed Henry Duncan and showed a degree of contempt for the audience. Helen had a second guide, Peggy, who was a mischievous child-spirit made out of a stockinette vest. Her party-piece was Baa-Baa Black Sheep, though she could also produce a verse of Loch Lomond.</p> <p>This was the practice of mediumship, as carried out by Helen Duncan in a career which spanned some twenty years, and engrossed thousands; it was a joke, a fiction that a child could see through. But the body of theory that Henry assimilated during his long sickly days was created by some of the finest minds of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Society for Psychical Research was founded in 1882 by a selection of eminent Victorians. It seems strange to us now that some of the best scientific brains of an era could have been employed on ghost hunts. But these men were not fools. They were asking reasonable questions about the natural world, and trying to establish an investigative framework for a new branch of science. They tried to maintain a healthy scepticism while not rejecting evidence because it came in unorthodox ways, and to formulate an experimental protocol which would be equal in rigour to that employed by practitioners in the more established branches of scientific knowledge. Their intellectual efforts were constantly sabotaged by the antics of some of the mediums themselves: so that spiritualism began to seem shoddy, trivial and childish. And if the showmen made problems for the scientists, so did the scientists make problems for the toiling medium, tied perspiring to her chair, tussling with the outrageous demands of her own unconscious. The events with which parapsychology concerns itself are irregular, spontaneous and ambivalent, but in order to prove that parapsychology was a science, researchers needed to analyse and quantify events which were repeatable, regular and unequivocal. The business of cheating is therefore not hard to understand. Once a medium had achieved results among her family and friends, the pressure was on to perform in public, and then obtain credentials by performing before investigative bodies. Mediums resorted to magicians' tricks, often as much out of a desire to please as a desire to make money; their suggestible personalities and sometimes low status made them vulnerable to flattery and afraid of losing their reputations if they did not get consistent results. Exposure might be shaming, but was not necessarily, or even usually, the end of a career. True believers hit back hard at anyone who challenged them; and there was always a small percentage of phenomena that no one could explain away without resorting to mental contortions that were greater than those required to accept, simply, that the dead were walking nightly through the land.</p> <p>When Duncan began to practise as a medium, some of her early 'manifestations' were terrifying in their violence and hostility. Her first s\u00e9ances brought her no profit, but around 1930 she began to glimpse commercial possibilities. Soon afterwards she agreed to her first London season, making a contract for sittings with the London Spiritualist Alliance, and decamping to a rented house in Thornton Heath. These sittings attracted genteel society, but they were also test s\u00e9ances, and proved a challenge for Henry Duncan when he had to explain why his wife extruded surgical gauze and fragments of a sanitary towel. Henry, more in sorrow than in anger, admitted that an hour or two before her sittings Helen would pass into a dissociated state in which she would secrete various articles about her person, not knowing what she did. Helen was, then, out of his control: and out of her own. If she cheated, she couldn't help it. Accused of theatrical feats of regurgitation, Helen said ingenuously: \"they give me credit for more than I can do.\"</p> <p>Her great mistake was her involvement with Harry Price, a ghost hunter, professional journalist and professional sceptic. Price liked to present himself as in pursuit of knowledge but was really, like so many in the spirit game, in pursuit of profit. In 1923 he had split off from the Society for Psychical Research - ghost-hunters are sectarian and quarrel a lot - and founded the National Laboratory of Psychical Research. The first time Helen saw him, at the headquarters of the LSA, she sensed 'malevolent vibrations'. Nevertheless she agreed to give sittings for him. It was easy to get her into his power, because she always wanted money; her trade was anything but secure. Gaskill does not try to work out how much money Duncan made, but is certain that the various bodies and societies who exhibited her took a much greater share of the proceeds of her work. By the evidence he gives of changes in her family's circumstances, she made enough to lift them out of poverty; this was achieved by a tough schedule and constant travelling, and by submitting herself to physical indignities at which a prostitute might baulk.</p> <p>Harry Price set about Duncan's humiliation with sadistic relish. He drafted in two doctors to examine her. \"They brought a bag of tools with them,\" he wrote, \"took off their coats to the job and really got down to it. But they found nothing. Every orifice and crack where an instrument or hand would go was thoroughly explored; every nook and cranny was examined; but at each fresh place they drew a blank.\" This blankness did not exonerate Helen. At her next s\u00e9ance the doctors pounced on her 'ectoplasm' with surgical scissors, and roused her from a trance by shouting into her face. She was in such bad physical shape that she was admitted to St Thomas's, where she swigged a bottle of disinfectant and had her stomach pumped. When she recovered, the LSA packed her off home. In 1933, at a s\u00e9ance in Scotland, she was surprised by a sitter who made a grab at her, turned on the lights and found her rapidly concealing 'Peggy' under her clothes. \"I'll brain you, you bloody bugger,'\"Helen shouted; she was prosecuted for fraud and fined ten pounds. But this setback, and Price's debunking report, hardly affected the esteem in which she was held in the world of spiritualist churches and societies. She flourished, especially when the second world war brought new separations and griefs to which she could cater. Once again, belief was not confined to the uneducated, but was widespread among dons, clergymen and officers in the Armed Forces; bereavement affected all classes. Gaskill estimates that the creed had a million adherents by 1944; there were a thousand churches and some fifty thousand home circles. In 1941 the Royal Navy recognised spiritualism as a religion and sailors were allowed to hold spiritualist services at sea. Helen pulled in huge audiences - until she attracted the attention of the authorities, and her antics at the Master Temple Psychic Centre in Portsmouth brought her to court under the Witchcraft Act.</p> <p>Gaskill leaves it till rather late in the book to ask what might have been going on in Duncan's head through her many years as empress and chief freak of the psychic world. As a historian of popular beliefs, he is more interested in her audiences than in Duncan herself, and his description of the heartless tricks practised by her colleagues and forbears is thorough to the point of tedium. This is not his fault; most books about spiritualism are more or less dull, because once the gross, unsophisticated nature of the frauds has been laid bare, there is no entertainment value in multiplying examples. The 'inner' history of mediumship is far more interesting, but it would necessarily comprehend a history of 'hysteria', in its various incarnations through the centuries: for since the end of the 19th century mediumship has been viewed as a ritualised form of hysteria, which converts weakness to strength and empowers the powerless. (To say this is to adopt the term, neutrally, for the purpose of discussion, and to leave aside the question of whether hysteria exists, or ever did exist, as a definable disease entity; the term may change, but the complex of behaviour once described as 'hysterical' can still be observed.) Gaskill recognises that, when shares in Helen's body are allocated, feminist and also psychoanalytical theories have a claim, but it is beyond the scope of his book to map their territory and patrol the borders. As he observes, it is not difficult to see how mediumship liberated its more genteel female practitioners. They could flirt with their audience and mock them; in deep trance, they could behave aggressively and with an overt sexuality.</p> <p>With Hellish Nell, the case is rather different. One senses a powerful personality trapped in a sick and disabled body which others despised for its ugliness. Swoons and faints were not the least of it for Nell; her flesh was marked with circular burns from \"returning ectoplasm\" (or her own cigarettes) and she often ended sessions as if she had been in a fight, \"dazed in the corner, blood and slime dripping from her chin\". In the world in which she grew up, there was a vast and perhaps damaging disjunction between middle-class ideals of femininity and the reality of working women's lives. Hysteria is empowering but it is also a punishable offence. For Helen, such fame and prosperity as she attained came at a high cost in physical and mental degradation: she was a performer in the pornography of her age. One of Harry Price's allies, a woman who examined Helen, told him she possessed \"enormous depths of pelvis\", and assured him that \"pelvic concealment of articles is one of the commonest acts of insane females, especially if there is any taint of immorality in them. One, two and three large bath towels, secreted in the pelvis, is of common occurrence in any Female Lunatic Asylum.\"</p> <p>This is the late-night gossip of ward orderlies, redolent of cocoa and gaslight; it is the chatter of the freak-show, from that Hogarthian London which Gaskill evokes early in the book; it is at the frontier of what one can say of a human being, without confiscating their humanity entirely. It would have been good to find Gaskill a little keener to nail it as myth-making and stigmatisation. But of course, it is not his job to defend Nell or pity her, slumped and bleeding in her corner, the corpses of the western front packed into her knickers, the drowned mariners of the Barham leaking from her ears. Sympathy is left to Nell herself, who like an infant can only speak of herself in the third person, and speak through the disdainful Albert: 'Thank goodness I love her, she is a poor beggar.'</p> <p>Gaskill gives a detailed account of the trial of Hellish Nell, but her subsequent history, and the history of her profession, can be summarised briefly. Emerging from Holloway, she was soon back at work, but she had to dodge the spiritualist authorities, and never quite recovered her former glory. In 1956 a s\u00e9ance in Nottingham was raided by the police; subsequently she was taken ill, and died five weeks later, aged 59. By then, the statute which had trapped her at the Old Bailey had been superseded. The Fraudulent Mediums Act of 1951 stated that no prosecutions were to be undertaken without the involvement of the DPP; where money had changed hands, spiritualists could be fined or imprisoned for fraud, but there was an exemption for \"anything done solely for the purposes of entertainment\". This Act, friendly to the trade, drew its teeth. The occult was degraded to an amusement; and television soon offered a better one. During the 1950s, interest in spiritualism fell away; communities fractured; credulity invested itself in flying saucers, and later in crop circles, reincarnation, alien pregnancies, millennial cults. Simple death - except to the rawly bereaved - was no longer interesting enough.</p> <p>Helen Duncan has successors, though she might despise them. Every weekend - in the South-East of England, at least - the newspapers advertise a selection of 'Psychic Fayres', as an alternative to the usual pursuits of DIY and out-of-town shopping. They are held in the banqueting annexes of steak-houses and the hospitality suites of non-league football clubs, and the mediums - who often themselves practise a variety of psychic arts - are mixed promiscuously with the tarot card readers and the palmists. Here they sit on fringed cushions behind trestle tables draped in sleazy silks and nylon velvets, stacked with an array of crystals and charms: carefully conforming to stereotype, just as if they were in a film about themselves. They have name cards which identify them as 'Tanya' or 'Lilia'; there are no Nells these days. There are male fortune tellers, but it's hard to see how they make a living: unsavoury, sallow, they slump in their chairs and watch the milling customers with dead eyes; if you touch palms with them, they feel damp and desperate. But the female psychics are smart, sharp-eyed, avid, hungry to work; they buzz with goodwill. If anything, they are too busy; they smudge their lipstick by snatching burgers between clients. They are all of Russian descent, they say, mixed with Romany; in psychic terms, Russian is the new Irish. It is true their accents often suggest an eastern derivation: Essex.</p> <p>Sometimes mediums give solo demonstrations, to audiences of a hundred or more. They operate in daylight, or in the glare of spotlights; there is no ectoplasm, no materialisation, nothing in the way of apports, no music, and no dogma. True professionals, they know how to work a room; they are unnaturally sharp, intuitive and knowing, expert in making the trivial seem profound, or the general particular. Finger hovering over a group of middle-aged women, they will diagnose headaches, or a need to see the optician; they are not above fixing a row with their gaze, and declaring \"someone here needs to see the dentist,\" zooming in without error on the traces of childish guilt they have elicited. These observations come to them courtesy of your dead relatives, and it is impossible not to shudder at the banal concerns of the spirits. \"Your Mum likes your new kitchen units,\" they will tell some hapless woman, who will shift and bleat on her stacking chair, and often shed a tear.</p> <p>Their reasoning is this: if Mum gave messages of an ethereal nature, pronouncing on the harmony of the spheres, we'd be no further forward, would we? But if she says, that's a very nice double sink, and your mixer tap is beyond reproach, and if she compliments you on your choice of dishwasher, we're in business: it's simple enough - have you a new kitchen, or haven't you?</p> <p>The suburbanisation of the psychic world was underway before Hellish Nell ceased her trade. Fitted kitchens aside, it has not moved on from the 1950s; to judge by accounts of what the dead get up to, the other world is still observing a British Sunday, old-style, with birdsong, and a picnic in the park. The weather is always fine; no one is in pain; no one ever dies, they 'pass'. In 'spirit world', everyone is at their own 'best age'. The concept of being 'differently abled' has not been introduced there. Torn-off limbs are restored, and amputated breasts. No one is blind or lame. Miscarried babies, of whatever gestation, are thriving in the arms of their great-grandmothers. Those who were aborted are never mentioned.</p> <p>The psychics draw out information as skilfully as the mediums of Nell's day, and they coax assent from their public by a sort of sweet bullying. It is fair to say that most members of their audience are scared witless; they have paid their money for prophecy and supernatural advice, but if fingered they sit staring like demented cod, struck speechless, and probably unable to take in what is being said to them, let alone process it and make a sensible reply. It looks like the most naked, risible form of public exploitation: but it is possible, even now, to feel pity for the practitioners of this desperate art. It is a sad thing to see a medium hyperventilating, trembling, running with sweat, gasping out messages from the ancestors to the gormless deracinated teenagers of the Thames Valley, who are too ignorant to know their grandparents' names or where they came from. The dead are all around us, they insist, hovering, taking care, taking an interest; but brokering them to the living is a wretched trade. What is the use of the dead talking, if no one has the skill to listen?</p> <p>\u0095 To read more online essays from the current edition of the London Review of Books visit the <a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk/\">LRB</a>.

The 'inner' history of mediumship is far more interesting, but it would necessarily comprehend a history of 'hysteria', in its various incarnations through the centuries: for since the end of the 19th century mediumship has been viewed as a ritualised form of hysteria, which converts weakness to strength and empowers the powerless. (To say this is to adopt the term, neutrally, for the purpose of discussion, and to leave aside the question of whether hysteria exists, or ever did exist, as a definable disease entity; the term may change, but the complex of behaviour once described as 'hysterical' can still be observed.) Gaskill recognises that, when shares in Helen's body are allocated, feminist and also psychoanalytical theories have a claim, but it is beyond the scope of his book to map their territory and patrol the borders. As he observes, it is not difficult to see how mediumship liberated its more genteel female practitioners. They could flirt with their audience and mock them; in deep trance, they could behave aggressively and with an overt sexuality. With Hellish Nell, the case is rather different. One senses a powerful personality trapped in a sick and disabled body which others despised for its ugliness. Swoons and faints were not the least of it for Nell; her flesh was marked with circular burns from \"returning ectoplasm\" (or her own cigarettes) and she often ended sessions as if she had been in a fight, \"dazed in the corner, blood and slime dripping from her chin\". In the world in which she grew up, there was a vast and perhaps damaging disjunction between middle-class ideals of femininity and the reality of working women's lives. Hysteria is empowering but it is also a punishable offence. For Helen, such fame and prosperity as she attained came at a high cost in physical and mental degradation: she was a performer in the pornography of her age. One of Harry Price's allies, a woman who examined Helen, told him she possessed \"enormous depths of pelvis\", and assured him that \"pelvic concealment of articles is one of the commonest acts of insane females, especially if there is any taint of immorality in them. One, two and three large bath towels, secreted in the pelvis, is of common occurrence in any Female Lunatic Asylum.\" This is the late-night gossip of ward orderlies, redolent of cocoa and gaslight; it is the chatter of the freak-show, from that Hogarthian London which Gaskill evokes early in the book; it is at the frontier of what one can say of a human being, without confiscating their humanity entirely. It would have been good to find Gaskill a little keener to nail it as myth-making and stigmatisation. But of course, it is not his job to defend Nell or pity her, slumped and bleeding in her corner, the corpses of the western front packed into her knickers, the drowned mariners of the Barham leaking from her ears. Sympathy is left to Nell herself, who like an infant can only speak of herself in the third person, and speak through the disdainful Albert: 'Thank goodness I love her, she is a poor beggar.' Gaskill gives a detailed account of the trial of Hellish Nell, but her subsequent history, and the history of her profession, can be summarised briefly. Emerging from Holloway, she was soon back at work, but she had to dodge the spiritualist authorities, and never quite recovered her former glory. In 1956 a s\u00e9ance in Nottingham was raided by the police; subsequently she was taken ill, and died five weeks later, aged 59. By then, the statute which had trapped her at the Old Bailey had been superseded. The Fraudulent Mediums Act of 1951 stated that no prosecutions were to be undertaken without the involvement of the DPP; where money had changed hands, spiritualists could be fined or imprisoned for fraud, but there was an exemption for \"anything done solely for the purposes of entertainment\". This Act, friendly to the trade, drew its teeth. The occult was degraded to an amusement; and television soon offered a better one. During the 1950s, interest in spiritualism fell away; communities fractured; credulity invested itself in flying saucers, and later in crop circles, reincarnation, alien pregnancies, millennial cults. Simple death - except to the rawly bereaved - was no longer interesting enough. Helen Duncan has successors, though she might despise them. Every weekend - in the South-East of England, at least - the newspapers advertise a selection of 'Psychic Fayres', as an alternative to the usual pursuits of DIY and out-of-town shopping. They are held in the banqueting annexes of steak-houses and the hospitality suites of non-league football clubs, and the mediums - who often themselves practise a variety of psychic arts - are mixed promiscuously with the tarot card readers and the palmists. Here they sit on fringed cushions behind trestle tables draped in sleazy silks and nylon velvets, stacked with an array of crystals and charms: carefully conforming to stereotype, just as if they were in a film about themselves. They have name cards which identify them as 'Tanya' or 'Lilia'; there are no Nells these days. There are male fortune tellers, but it's hard to see how they make a living: unsavoury, sallow, they slump in their chairs and watch the milling customers with dead eyes; if you touch palms with them, they feel damp and desperate. But the female psychics are smart, sharp-eyed, avid, hungry to work; they buzz with goodwill. If anything, they are too busy; they smudge their lipstick by snatching burgers between clients. They are all of Russian descent, they say, mixed with Romany; in psychic terms, Russian is the new Irish. It is true their accents often suggest an eastern derivation: Essex. Sometimes mediums give solo demonstrations, to audiences of a hundred or more. They operate in daylight, or in the glare of spotlights; there is no ectoplasm, no materialisation, nothing in the way of apports, no music, and no dogma. True professionals, they know how to work a room; they are unnaturally sharp, intuitive and knowing, expert in making the trivial seem profound, or the general particular. Finger hovering over a group of middle-aged women, they will diagnose headaches, or a need to see the optician; they are not above fixing a row with their gaze, and declaring \"someone here needs to see the dentist,\" zooming in without error on the traces of childish guilt they have elicited. These observations come to them courtesy of your dead relatives, and it is impossible not to shudder at the banal concerns of the spirits. \"Your Mum likes your new kitchen units,\" they will tell some hapless woman, who will shift and bleat on her stacking chair, and often shed a tear. Their reasoning is this: if Mum gave messages of an ethereal nature, pronouncing on the harmony of the spheres, we'd be no further forward, would we? But if she says, that's a very nice double sink, and your mixer tap is beyond reproach, and if she compliments you on your choice of dishwasher, we're in business: it's simple enough - have you a new kitchen, or haven't you? The suburbanisation of the psychic world was underway before Hellish Nell ceased her trade. Fitted kitchens aside, it has not moved on from the 1950s; to judge by accounts of what the dead get up to, the other world is still observing a British Sunday, old-style, with birdsong, and a picnic in the park. The weather is always fine; no one is in pain; no one ever dies, they 'pass'. In 'spirit world', everyone is at their own 'best age'. The concept of being 'differently abled' has not been introduced there. Torn-off limbs are restored, and amputated breasts. No one is blind or lame. Miscarried babies, of whatever gestation, are thriving in the arms of their great-grandmothers. Those who were aborted are never mentioned. The psychics draw out information as skilfully as the mediums of Nell's day, and they coax assent from their public by a sort of sweet bullying. It is fair to say that most members of their audience are scared witless; they have paid their money for prophecy and supernatural advice, but if fingered they sit staring like demented cod, struck speechless, and probably unable to take in what is being said to them, let alone process it and make a sensible reply. It looks like the most naked, risible form of public exploitation: but it is possible, even now, to feel pity for the practitioners of this desperate art. It is a sad thing to see a medium hyperventilating, trembling, running with sweat, gasping out messages from the ancestors to the gormless deracinated teenagers of the Thames Valley, who are too ignorant to know their grandparents' names or where they came from. The dead are all around us, they insist, hovering, taking care, taking an interest; but brokering them to the living is a wretched trade. What is the use of the dead talking, if no one has the skill to listen? \u0095 To read more online essays from the current edition of the London Review of Books visit the LRB.

Philip Sturman, chief officer of Leicestershire Community Health Council, which represents patients, urged the public not to panic. \"It is important not to scare people with these results - screening saves lives,\" he said. The NHS cervical screening programme was set up in 1988 and is based in Sheffield. It has screened almost four million women in England each year with around 3,450 new cases of cervical cancer - the most common form of cancer in women aged under 35 - diagnosed. Figures show that 83.7% of women of screening age have had a smear in the last five years with 3.3m women aged 25 to 64 screened. The smear test spots abnormal cells, but does not test for cancer itself.

      "body": "<p>Advanced or A-levels have proved a resilient qualification but they were designed for an era when far fewer people went on to university. New students bent their choices to their strengths. The proportion of A-level students taking the \"mixed\" option, sciences and arts/ social science subjects together, rose from less than a tenth in 1962 to more than a third in 1995.</p> <p>But such mixtures did not entail breadth and there were difficulties. Some of those who did not mix and match found themselves narrowed into an all-science or all-arts curriculum.</p> <p>These trends, charted by Alan Smithers at Liverpool University, help explain the thinking behind Curriculum 2000, the new post-16 system of qualifications for England, Wales and Northern Ireland. David Blunkett the education secretary wants more students to take a science or a language alongside their principal subjects. He has also introduced \"vocational A-levels\", another can of worms. In some of the first such exams nine out of ten students failed.</p> <p>The new attempt to broaden the 16-18 curriculum, which got going last September, is about to face its first serious test as this summer thousands of lower sixth formers start taking the new AS-level.</p> <p>The old A-level calendar of five terms of thinking deep thoughts before a student's future was decided in a short, brutal summer at the end of the upper sixth had been undermined in recent years by modular A-level courses and the introduction of AS levels. Now it has been demolished. Students do not have to complete two years now to have something to show for their work. But they are expected to take four or five AS levels in their first year of study.</p> <p>Most students take the exams in June. In the second year of sixth form, they take A2s. The AS and the A2 together constitutes a new A-level. The AS is a qualification in its own right, but the A2 is not. The AS level is meant to be easier than A-level, though perhaps not \"GCSE plus 10%\" as it has been characterised. The A2 is supposed to be harder than A-level but some teachers reckon it will do well to retain the same standard.</p> <p>The government also wants students to acquire \"key skills\" within their course.

      "bodyText": "Advanced or A-levels have proved a resilient qualification but they were designed for an era when far fewer people went on to university. New students bent their choices to their strengths. The proportion of A-level students taking the \"mixed\" option, sciences and arts/ social science subjects together, rose from less than a tenth in 1962 to more than a third in 1995. But such mixtures did not entail breadth and there were difficulties. Some of those who did not mix and match found themselves narrowed into an all-science or all-arts curriculum. These trends, charted by Alan Smithers at Liverpool University, help explain the thinking behind Curriculum 2000, the new post-16 system of qualifications for England, Wales and Northern Ireland. David Blunkett the education secretary wants more students to take a science or a language alongside their principal subjects. He has also introduced \"vocational A-levels\", another can of worms. In some of the first such exams nine out of ten students failed. The new attempt to broaden the 16-18 curriculum, which got going last September, is about to face its first serious test as this summer thousands of lower sixth formers start taking the new AS-level. The old A-level calendar of five terms of thinking deep thoughts before a student's future was decided in a short, brutal summer at the end of the upper sixth had been undermined in recent years by modular A-level courses and the introduction of AS levels. Now it has been demolished. Students do not have to complete two years now to have something to show for their work. But they are expected to take four or five AS levels in their first year of study. Most students take the exams in June. In the second year of sixth form, they take A2s. The AS and the A2 together constitutes a new A-level. The AS is a qualification in its own right, but the A2 is not. The AS level is meant to be easier than A-level, though perhaps not \"GCSE plus 10%\" as it has been characterised. The A2 is supposed to be harder than A-level but some teachers reckon it will do well to retain the same standard. The government also wants students to acquire \"key skills\" within their course. These are listed as numerical skills, communications and information technology. Next year, new \"advanced extension awards\" will be available for the brightest students. So far, the fullest description of the first year of Curriculum 2000 comes from the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service, which surveyed 1,300 schools.

      "bodyText": "The Independent has become the latest newspaper to scale back its internet operation. The cuts - believed to affect seven contract staff and all casuals - were made last week as part of a longer-term plan to achieve profitability. Overheads have been cut and Independent Digital has been reduced to a core of around 18 staff. Richard Withey, the managing director of Independent Digital, said it was now track to break even by the first quarter of 2002. \"We've always run a small, tight but effective ship. Yes, we have lost a couple of contractors, and some casual shifts, but we still have enough of both, plus our very effective permanent team led on the editorial side by David Felton,\" he said. \"Our recent and well-received redesign led to much greater automation, and allows us to do this without pain.\" Independent.co.uk was launched as the paper's most significant online offensive to date in July 1999, but soon after began to scale back its investment in original content and remained a modestly sized operation when competitors began to rapidly expand. However, to show it meant business, the Independent brought in two former News International internet experts, Mr Withey and Paul Simon, and seconded David Felton, assistant editor on the paper, to be online editor. Mr Simon left last month to set up his own consultancy, called Isaiah Consulting. The recent belt-tightening reflects an industry-wide trend to button down and survive the downturn in internet advertising revenues. Last month the Financial Times said it was cutting 40 staff, Trinity Mirror laid off 85 staff and closed a number of websites, while Emap slashed 100 staff from Emap Digital and axed some websites.

      "bodyText": "Scottish local government could be working under a new statutory \"best value\" service-delivery regime in less than two years' time, the Holyrood parliament has announced. The principles behind the new system will be broadly the same as those already implemented for local government in England and Wales, which place a legal duty on councils to secure \"continuous improvement\" of their performance. Scotland's deputy finance and local government minister Peter Peacock said the executive would bring forward legislative proposals in the autumn, and a spokeswoman confirmed that the system could be in place by late 2002. Scottish councils already operate under a non-statutory best-value framework with the previous and widely disliked compulsory competitive tendering regime suspended. The Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (Cosla) said that the legal groundwork of Scottish best value would be more a product of partnership working between local and central government than the English system had been. Cosla claims the bill will draw close connections between best value and community planning, a process that sees councils drawing up a vision for their area in close consultation with local people. The convention also expects the new bill to be less prescriptive than its English counterpart, allowing local councils more freedom on how they consult their communities, and how they present information about their performance. Audit Scotland may take the role of policing the new system, although the details of the inspection regime are still under discussion. A Cosla spokesman said one of the options being debated was a cross-sector inspectorate. Cosla president Norman Murray welcomed Mr Peacock's announcement, saying that the executive would work closely with local government on the bill: \"The executive has given its commitment to working in partnership with us, and we in Cosla are equally committed to playing a full part and working closely with the executive during the bill's progress.\" Mr Peacock's move comes after a period of heavy discussion with local authorities north of the border.

      "bodyText": "The editor of BBC Radio's Today programme has refuted Tory chairman Michael Ancram's claim that the BBC is \"empty of people who hold Conservative views\". In this week's Spectator magazine, Rod Liddle presents a straw poll of views held by producers and reporters on the programme which he says show a \"fair amount of sympathy for the ideological touchstones identified by the Conservative chairman as anathema to BBC people\". The poll, which Mr Liddle admits was \"vulnerable to editorial gerrymandering\" reveals that 66% of staff on the programme support reduced government, while 60% want to keep the pound. The claim contradicts Mr Ancram's assertion that \"the politically correct environment [of the programme] dictates that belief in lower taxes, smaller government and saving the pound are the wrong beliefs to hold\". Mr Liddle does, however, concede that Labour was the most popular party, garnering 35.7% of the vote, with the Conservatives coming in second. Earlier this year Mr Liddle was tipped as a potential replacement for the Spectator's editor, Boris Johnson, who is expected to leave the magazine to stand as a Tory MP.

Government officials said they were trying still to identify the man, and planned to expel him to China within a couple of days. National broadcaster NHK reported that the man told authorities he was South Korean. A South Korean government source said: \"There is a possibility that he may indeed be Kim Jong Nam, the son of Kim Jong Il. But we are still collecting intelligence and we cannot say it for sure.\" Kyodo said immigration officers detained the man when he arrived from Singapore on Tuesday aboard a Japan Airlines flight with three other people. He carried a forged passport from the Dominican Republic, Kyodo said. The national police agency, the immigration office, the prime minister's spokesman, Narita police, the Foreign Ministry and the airline all said that they could not immediately confirm the reports. Japanese government sources said that the people with the man were thought to be relatives. The general association of Korean residents in Japan said it had no information on the report and that no visit by the reclusive North Korean leader's eldest son was scheduled. Meanwhile, Kim Jong Il today told a European delegation that his moratorium on missile tests would last at least until 2003, officials said. During five hours of talks with the first western European leaders to visit North Korea, Kim also said that he wants to hold a second summit with South Korean leader Kim Dae Jung, but not while the Bush administration is reviewing its policies with the North, EU officials said. They added that North Korea has agreed to send officials to Europe this summer to discuss opening talks about its human rights record. Little is known about Kim Jong Il's family, but according to South Korean officials, he is believed to have three children, including Kim Jong Nam, who was born in 1971. All were born to different mothers. Kim Jong Nam was born to 64-year-old Sung Hae Rim. Sung made international headlines in 1996 when she was reported to have defected to the West after disappearing from her Swiss villa. The news followed rumours that Kim Jong Il had jilted her. But South Korea's main government spy agency later denied the reports. Kim Jong Nam has lived most of his life abroad, in countries such as Switzerland and Russia. His mother, Sung, is believed to be in Moscow for medical treatment for depression.

The Spanish giants, who were quoted a price of \u00a318.5m when they inquired after the Australian earlier this season, were unimpressed by his performance against Valencia last night. \"Mark Viduka disappointed me in this match,\" coach Vicente del Bosque told onefootball.com. \"I remembered when he played against us in the Santiago Bernabeu, he was almost a perfect striker. But since then, I think he has become worse and worse as the season has gone on. For this match he did not seem very focussed and nor did Alan Smith.\" Juventus are the latest club to be linked with a move for Arsene Wenger when his Arsenal contract expires at the end of next season. The Daily Star reckons that current coach Carlo Ancelotti will be sacked in the summer and replaced by former hero Marcello Lippi, but only for the one season before Wenger takes over. Gerard Houllier is ready to further strengthen his Liverpool squad this summer, telling the Mirror: \"We need two or three new players.\" The paper speculates that those three are Bixente Lizarazu, Frank Lampard, and Damien Duff. Planet Football reports that Real Madrid have made an offer for Lazio's Juan Sebastian Veron. They quote the player's lawyer, Guiseppe Petrelli, as saying: \"Lazio have received an offer from Real Madrid for my client which is practically double what Cragnotti paid Parma for Veron two years ago.\" Ipswich manager George Burley will be given \u00a315m to spend on new players this summer, according to the Mirror. Derby's on-loan Icelandic international Thordur Gudjonsson has claimed Spurs are interested in signing him this summer. \"Teams from Germany, Hansa Rostock and Werder Bremen, and Tottenham from England are chasing me,\" Gudjonsson told Planet Football. Whether this has anything to do with the fact that Derby have failed to take up the option of signing him themselves remains to be seen.",

Monstrous constructions appeared on the south bank of the Thames, the foundation stone was solemnly laid for a National Theatre, but there was little popular exuberance among the straitened people, and dollar-bearing tourists curtailed their visits and sped to the countries of the Continent where, however precarious their condition, they ordered things better.\"</p> <p>Poor Evelyn Waugh. It was certainly not the Festival of his Britain. For those sections of the upper- and middle-classes of whose subconscious anxieties he is the curator the Festival marked the climax of a decade in which almost every single act of government had been inimical to their immediate interests. Festival Britain was the Britain of the radical middle-classes, the do-gooders; the readers of the News Chronicle, the Guardian, and the Observer; the signers of petitions; the backbone of the B.B.C. In short, the Herbivores, or gentle ruminants, who look out from the lush pastures which are their natural station in life with eyes full of sorrow for less fortunate creatures, guiltily conscious of their advantages, though not usually ceasing to eat the grass. And in making the Festival they earned the contempt of the Carnivores - the readers of the Daily Express; the Evelyn Waughs; the cast of the Directory of Directors - the members of the upper- and middle-classes who believe that if God had not wished them to prey on all smaller and weaker creatures without scruple he would not have made them as they are.</p> <p>For a decade, sanctioned by the exigencies of war and its aftermath, the Herbivores had dominated the scene. By 1951 the regime which supported them was exhausted, and the Carnivores were ready to take over. The Festival was the last, and virtually the posthumous, work of the Herbivore Britain of the BBC News, the Crown Film Unit, the sweet ration, the Ealing comedies, Uncle Mac, Sylvia Peters ... all the great fixed stars by which my childhood was navigated.</p> <p>The King declared the Festival open on May 3rd 1951. There was a sense of holiday in the air, and, after careful observation of the crowds lining the streets to see the Royal Family, The Times gave its verdict - \"People in Joyous Mood.\" At the South Bank they worked all that day - and all that night - and as the guests began to come through the front gates for the private view on the morning of May 4th. The South Bank, or at any rate, 95% of it, was ready on schedule. By the time the official visitors had left and the first handful of the general public had been let in, it was pouring with rain. The visitors splashed dismally round, offering no visible evidence of enjoyment. It was a gloomy baptism.</p> <p>But the sense of anti-climax did not last. It quickly became clear that the South Bank, conceived in austerity and shaped by expediency, was a knockout. For two or three evenings the police had to close the streets round the Embankment to traffic, as the crowds poured down to gaze at the floodlit dream-world breathing music on the other side of the river. \"People making for the South Bank,\" reported the Manchester Guardian, \"begin to smile as they come close to it.\" The Guardian suggested that \"on bright sunny days it seems likely that a trip across the Thames to the South Bank will be as invigorating as a trip across the Channel.\" It certainly was. The crowds came in, and wandered round in a state of somnambulism, forming queues with such abstracted readiness that the attendants found difficulty in preventing the accumulation of queues that led nowhere at all.</p> <p>No one had ever seen anything like it before. Apart from the New Towns, it was one of the first concerted attempts at modern architecture in Britain in this century, a brilliant microcosm in which every single object had been designed for its job. For a few hours people stepped out of the squalid compromises of the everyday urban scene into a world where everything was made to please. There was music on the loudspeakers to walk round to. There were plenty of cafes to sit down at. There were the two distinctive shapes by which cartoons and souvenirs of the Festival were instantly identifiable - the great closed scallop shell of Ralph Tubb's Dome of Discovery and the Skylon, the luminous exclamation mark with which the young engineers Powell and Moya had won the competition for vertical feature. Round every corner there was a new delight - a catwalk to look down from, or the superb water mobile by Richard Huws, which imitated the regular sequence of small and great waves on the shore. There was the river to look at. And, on the other side of the river, the magnificent sombre building line of the north bank, revealed for the first time as a back curtain to the colourful and extravagant outlines of the Festival architecture.</p> <p>Later in the season balloonists took off from the South Bank and drifted with the wind in the leisurely way of Edwardian high summer, to the open country outside the city. Charles Elleano crossed the river on a tight-rope. And twice a week, when darkness fell, there was open-air dancing among the twinkling lights that studded the Fairway.</p> <p>Someone, unfairly described the South Bank exhibition as \"all Heal let loose\". Afterwards, the fashions it set in architecture and design were quickly copied, became cliches, and eventually looked vulgar against the growing affluence of the fifties. But now that the whole painful process of outgrowing an out-of-date fashion has been completed, we can look back and appreciate just what a box of delights the South Bank really was. Though, as with any box of delights, the most delightful thing was the packaging, and the air of surprise and excitement it gave to the contents. The contents themselves were a little more mundane. The exhibition was supposed to show Britain's contribution to civilisation. This, of course, is the sort of thing that museums are about anyway and the Festival could only do it in the same way that a museum would, with samples of fossils and steam-engines, and pictures of more fossils and more steam-engines. But what else can you have a national exhibition about? Still, the splendour of their housing carried the exhibits; and the radar screens, the craftsmen making cricket-bats, and the three dimensional representations of the integral calculus gave point and a sense of importance to their surroundings. The best thing of all about the South Bank was just being there.</p> <p>Over eight million people went to the Pleasure Gardens at Battersea, and nearly eight and a half million visited the South Bank. But there can have been few people in Britain whose lives remained completely untouched by the Festival. The Festival symbol devised by Abram Games was ubiquitous. So was the word \"Festival\". The great programme of poetry readings, serenade concerts, firework displays, and children's sports rolled across Britain relentlessly, and, though the local Festival Rose Show may have been remote in spirit from the pre-stressed concrete elan of the South Bank, it brought with it some suggestion of national identity and consciousness. The BBC - the most thoroughbred Herbivores of all - hammered the Festival into the national cortex with 2,700 programmes on the subject.</p> <p>At the end of September the Festival closed. The King should have been present, but he was ill - dying, as it turned out. The curious summer was over; a way of life was ending, too.</p> <p>What is one to think of the Festival? It was not quite the roaring success of the Great Exhibition, which was seen by six million people - a third of the population at that time. Nor did it generate the intense national enthusiasm of a piece of routine royal pageantry like the Coronation. Rainald Wells, who at the beginning of the year had suggested abandoning it, gave in the Daily Telegraph a grudging but not crushing verdict on behalf of the Carnivores: \"It may perhaps be likened to a moderately successful party, but one held on he wrong day and at far too great a cost. We are none the sadder for it, but we might have been wiser to have kept the money in our pockets.\" Far too great a cost? The total net expenditure, apart from the loans for the Festival Gardens, was just over eight million pounds comfortably within the estimate. Not quite so satisfactory as the 1851 Exhibition, which made profits big enough to finance the building of the Victoria and Albert Museum but cheap by modern standards of Government expenditure. By a not overwhelming majority the country liked the Festival. But the South Bank and Battersea were also paid a more striking compliment. The acid democratic test of housing estates and similar undertakings is whether or not they are smashed up by that section of the community which has no other redress for being treated with contempt or condescension; and at the end of the season the police were struck by the absence of hooliganism and other crime in both places. It was quite a tribute.</p> <p>The Festival was a rainbow - a brilliant sign riding the tail of the storm and promising fairer weather. It marked the ending of the hungry forties, and the beginning of an altogether easier decade. But it was not, as its critics had feared, to mark the consolidation of the Herbivorious forces which had made it. To adapt Rainald Wells's verdict, it may perhaps be likened to a gay and enjoyable birthday party, but one at which the host presided from his death-bed.</p> <p>\u00a9 Copyright Michael Frayn.

      "bodyText": "The Big Brother PR supremo, James Herring, is at the centre of a court battle following his sudden departure from Avalon. The company took out a high court injunction against Mr Herring after it emerged that a company run by his wife, Cath Taylor, had won a contract to handle some of the PR for the new series of Big Brother. Mr Herring masterminded the PR for the last series for Avalon. The injunction means that Mr Herring, who resigned from Avalon at the end of last year, will not be able to work for any of the company's competitors, including Cath Taylor Associates, during his one-year notice period. Mr Herring gave the court an undertaking to agree to the terms of the injunction. \"The directors of Avalon wish to make it clear that legal action against an employee has never been necessary in 12 years of running the Avalon group,\" the company said in a statement. \"This unprecedented step by Avalon was taken with regret (following consultation with Avalon's senior staff, directors and legal team) in light of the exceptional circumstances surrounding Mr Herring's sudden departure from the company and the suspicions generated by the movement of the Big Brother PR business.\" The statement said Mr Herring had failed to turn up for work on April 2, despite previous assurances he would remain at the company until a handover to his successor had been completed. The company will also seek legal damages from Mr Herring over the affair. He handed in his notice at the company last October to join media company iBalls.

      "bodyText": "Before George Bush announced his ambitious plans for global missile defence this week, he made a point of telephoning interested parties to tell them what he proposed. This courtesy was extended to other leaders such as Britain's Tony Blair and Russia's president, Vladimir Putin. But South Korea's president, Kim Dae Jung, had to wait a day to get his call from the White House - after Bush had already delivered his speech. If Kim were feeling sensitive, he might be inclined to resent what that seems to say about Seoul's place in Washington's international pecking order. The US president's delay in calling was doubly odd, given that what he had to say about the necessity of missile defence has special relevance to South Korea and to Kim's own political position. In his announcement, Bush pointed the finger of blame at North Korea as one of the world's \"least responsible\" states - states that were bent on acquiring weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and advanced missile technology that flouted anti-proliferation efforts. Although the US president did not mention the Pyongyang regime by name, there could be no doubt who he was talking about. Earlier in the week, the US state department also singled out North Korea for opprobrium. In common with Iraq, Iran, Libya, Sudan and Cuba, it was once again labelled a state sponsor of international terrorism. This toughening American line is based on part on a Pentagon report, published in January, that accused North Korea of having secretly developed one or perhaps two nuclear weapons - despite a 1994 agreement with the US on peaceful uses of nuclear technology. The Pentagon said North Korea was developing a two and three-stage intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) that could carry a small nuclear warhead, or a chemical or biological weapon, to US territory; and that it was actively stockpiling medium and short-range ballistic missiles that threatened South Korea and Japan. For good measure, the Americans described North Korea as a \"major proliferator\" of WMD-related technology, particularly in respect of exports to Iran and Pakistan. When Bush met Kim in Washington in February, he surprised the South Korean leader by insisting not only that North Korea was a big threat but also that it could not be trusted to keep its word. He announced that the US was freezing contacts with Pyongyang, despite the openings made by the Clinton administration, and launched an overall policy review. Given the seriousness of the North Korean problem, as the Americans see it, and given that North Korea's supposed activities underpin the rationale for missile defence, it is perhaps all the more surprising that Bush did not contact Kim earlier. For the fact of the matter, which Bush advisers if not Bush himself surely appreciate, is that it is South Korea - not the US - that is most directly threatened by a deterioration in relations with North Korea and by North Korean weapons. It is South Korea that is still technically at war with the North, 50 years after the Korean conflict divided the peninsula. And it is South Korea - and specifically Kim - that has launched a sunshine policy of detente aimed at bridging the divide and ultimately bringing the nation together. This sunshine policy, which came to a climax of sorts last June with the first ever meeting between Kim and North Korea's \"great general\", Kim Jong Il, is now in serious danger of clouding over, if not of being engulfed in a thunderstorm. Much of that is due to Washington's new hard line which has antagonised and alarmed the North and dismayed Kim Dae Jung. Earlier this year, North Korea threatened to end the voluntary freeze of missile testing that it had undertaken in talks with the US. Last week, it demanded the withdrawal of the 37,000 US troops that are based in South Korea. After Bush's missile defence speech, it angrily denounced the US leader. Various confidence-building measures agreed at last year's summit between the two Korean leaders, including the opening of a railway link, have been delayed or stymied by this growing atmosphere of distrust. Even though North Korea is said to be once again facing a food crisis, and is importing emergency supplies of fertiliser from international aid donors, its leadership seems to be digging in politically too, as faith in Kim's peace process fades on both sides of the border. Kim had hoped above all that Kim Jong Il could be induced to attend a follow-up summit in Seoul next month. That now looks increasingly unlikely. If Kim did not apportion considerable blame for this deterioration on the change of administration in Washington, he would be less than human. In his conversation with Bush, he implored the US to complete its policy review and get the dialogue going again as a matter of urgency. All he got by way of reply was a complacent assurance that the new US policy would be enunciated \"in timely fashion\". Unfortunately, it already seems pretty clear what sort of line the Bush administration is going to adopt. Its top defence and security priority is missile defence. North Korea, as depicted by Washington, provides a key justification of the need for missile defence. So its status as a missile-toting 'rogue state' cut off from US assistance and international lending looks set to continue. If the US opts for ostracism instead of openness, Kim knows it could spell the end for his sunshine policy and the political kudos (including the Nobel peace prize) it has brought him. He also knows that although the EU sent a delegation to Pyongyang this week determined to revive the peace process, it is Washington that largely calls the shots, militarily, financially and diplomatically, on the Korean peninsula. If the detente between the Koreas does indeed collapse, it may come to be seen as the first victim of Bush's doctrine of missile defence. Far from making the world a safer place, it will have delivered an enormous setback to peace in one of the most dangerous places on earth.

The account was previously handled by Avalon PR, which is at the centre of a row over the programme's former PR chief, James Herring. Big Brother's promotion and media handling will be headed up by Henry's House founder, Julian Henry, and director Charlotte Hickson as part of a five-strong team. But the programme's commercial and online PR account, won last month by Cath Taylor Associates, is at the centre of controversy. Cath Taylor's husband, James Herring, masterminded PR for Big Brother's last series while working at Avalon, from which he resigned at the end of last year. Avalon has now taken out an court injunction against Mr Herring after \"suspicions generated by the movement of the Big Brother PR business\". Ms Taylor is believed to be in talks with her lawyers. Henry's House has carried out previous campaigns for Channel 4, handling PR on the Big Breakfast and the Zoe Ball vehicle, the Priory. The agency will provide a round-the-clock press office by setting up a combined office and flat close to the Big Brother house in east London's Bromley-by-Bow. A 24-hour media hotline and website for the press will operate. Related story 03.05.2001: Injunction against PR man Herring MediaGuardian.co.uk special report Big Brother",

      "bodyText": "The swift three-day destruction of Vladimir Gusinsky\u00d5s media holding has been Moscow\u00d5s biggest, most inflammatory political upheaval. Indeed, it was a blitzkrieg: at 3am on the night before Easter, the management of the NTV television company \u00d0 Mr Gusinsky\u00d5s major operation and the heart of his Media-Most holding \u00d0 was replaced. Two weeks ago, two more Gusinsky-owned publications were targeted \u00d0 the newspaper Sevodnya was closed and the editor-in-chief of the magazine, Itogi, was replaced. It was a truly crushing defeat. Of Mr Gusinsky\u00d5s former media empire, only the popular Ekho Moskvy radio station remains. But it is quite clear the radio station will not be overlooked and its hour will come. I am, or rather was, a staff writer for the (now defunct) newspaper Sevodnya. On Monday 16 April, I wrote an article for the next issue of the newspaper and faxed it to the office at about 7pm. At 10pm I switched on my TV set and heard the newspaper had been shut down. Mr Gusinsky\u00d5s Media-Most holding incorporated NTV, Ekho Moskvy, the television company TNT, the publishing house Sem Dnei (including Sevodnya, Itogi and the magazines Sem Dnei and Karavan Istorii), the satellite television company NTV plus the film company Kino-Most and several other organisations. In its best times (before the 1998 crisis) Media-Most was valued at over $1bn (a huge amount for Russia). However, the financial crisis that hit Russia in 1998 and the dramatic dwindling of the advertising market had put Most in a precarious position and caused serious financial problems. Mr Gusinsky found a simple way out. He took loans from Russia\u00d5s gigantic gas firm Gazprom. In exchange, Gazprom became a co-owner of Media-Most and its various structures (Gazprom owns 46% of NTV shares). Mr Gusinsky tried to keep a controlling stake in his companies but, gradually, he became more entangled. This is the financial side of the story \u00d0 the side that has been dwelled on at length by Gazprom managers, who insist everything is very simple: Mr Gusinsky is bankrupt. His property will be taken over by the creditor as the payment of debt. And that\u00d5s it. There is nothing more to discuss. But there is. The reasons for Mr Gusinsky\u00d5s rise and fall lie not in business but in politics. Mr Gusinsky saw the mass media not as \"pure business\" but as an instrument of political influence. He built NTV not in order to get profits from advertising (although, of course, he tried) but because he was hoping to squeeze financial gains from the political game. Mr Gusinsky quarrelled with most of Boris Yeltsin\u00d5s inner circle, but his position became even shakier when Vladimir Putin came to power. During the parliamentary elections in 1999, Mr Gusinsky supported Mr Putin\u00d5s opponents. When they lost, Mr Gusinsky added a short name \u00d0 Mr Putin \u00d0 to the long list of his enemies. And then the time came to repay Gazprom. Gazprom, under pressure from the Kremlin, demanded the repayment of credits not in the form of lobbying services (as in the past) but in cash. The trap in which Mr Gusinsky had put himself slammed shut, from both sides, financial and political. Mr Gusinsky was arrested in Moscow but was then released in exchange for a promise to sell his holding. He left for Spain, where he looks set to remain now the Spanish authorities have refused to cooperate in extraditing him to Russia. Finally, Gazprom removed the NTV management on absolutely legal grounds, having established a majority control over the station. The NTV staff challenged the takeover, triggering street protests in Moscow. But in the early morning of April 14, Gazprom officials came to the NTV offices and seized control of the company. Of the 350 NTV journalists who left, many are now working for the TV-6 channel owned by another disgraced and exiled oligarch, Boris Berezovsky. With our newspaper Sevodnya, things were even simpler. The director of the publishing house, Sem Dnei Biryukov, was only too happy to see the back of of Mr Gusinsky. Biryukov and Gazprom have a controlling interest in the publishing house. In a meeting with Mr Gusinsky\u00d5s lawyers, they decided to liquidate our newspaper, which is a political irritant to the Kremlin. A fundamental question remains. Does all this mean the destruction of the freedom of speech in Russia, or at least the \"beginning of the end\" for this freedom? I have no definite answer.

But it is still unclear whether the destruction of Mr Gusinsky\u00d5s business was a strike against freedom of speech or personal revenge against Mr Gusinsky by Mr Putin's and Mr Yeltsin\u00d5s circle. If this is just a personal revenge against Mr Gusinsky, the campaign against the mass media will end once he is out and elements of freedom of speech will remain. If this is a campaign against freedom of speech, then it is just the beginning. NTV journalists will not be allowed to work on the TV-6 channel and opposition newspapers will start to be closed one by one. Because Mr Putin holds his cards so close to his chest, either option seems at present to be equally plausible.

It is a stripped down version of a PC that turns a TV into a digital home entertainment centre. Among its many features are music and movie playback, video recording, game playing via CD-Rom, and internet and email access. </p> <p>Its headline feature is its hard disk video recorder that enables time-shifters to store programmes on its 40gigabyte hard disk. The unit will also pause live TV. The hard disk can be used to store music as MP3 files. These can either be ripped from its CD player or downloaded from the net. </p> <p>The unit's home cinema facilities include a Dolby digital surround sound decoder and a DVD player. </p> <p>The basic Takami, which is accompanied by a remote control, wireless keyboard and stereo speakers, is on sale now for \u00a3999. Tiny is also offering the unit with a 15inch LCD screen for \u00a31,500.

Further memory can be added with the addition of a CompactFlash card. </p> <p>The DX3500 has an image resolution of 2.2 megapixels and features a 3x digital zoom. It goes on sale later this month. In July it will be joined by the DDX3600 which adds a 2x optical zoom and digital video to the specification of its sibling model. Both models are also Mac compatible. <a href=\"http://www.kodak.co.uk  \">www.kodak.co.uk</a> </p> <p><strong> Cut-price Intel</strong> Intel has slashed the price of 1.5GHz and 1.4GHz Pentium 4 processors following the introduction of the 1.7GHz version. The faster version has been launched at an unexpectedly low price: $352 compared with $519 for the 1.5GHz chip. On Monday Intel halved the price of the slower chips, with the 1.5GHz falling from $519 to $256, and the 1.4GHz falling from $375 to $193. However, Intel did not cut the price of Pentium III processors, and at $225, a 1GHz PIII now costs more than a faster P4. The 1.5GHz P4 has had its price cut three times in the past two months: earlier this year, it cost more than $800. Intel wants to move the PC market as rapidly as possible from the PIII to the P4, and is also under competitive pressure from AMD's Athlon and Duron processors, which can use cheaper memory chips. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Nokia junior Nokia is once again aiming for the youth market with a budget mobile phone that goes on sale this week. The dual band Nokia 3300 has interchangeable covers, a Wap browser and games. The 3300 also sees the debut of a new game - Bumper. Other game packs and animated screen savers can be downloaded via the Club Nokia web and Wap sites. Other facilities include voice dialing and a ring first then vibrate option. Talk time is rated at 4.5 hours, standby at 260 hours. www.nokia.com Tiny view It might connect to a TV and look like a large silver VCR, but there is far more to Tiny Computer's Takami than just video recording. It is a stripped down version of a PC that turns a TV into a digital home entertainment centre. Among its many features are music and movie playback, video recording, game playing via CD-Rom, and internet and email access. Its headline feature is its hard disk video recorder that enables time-shifters to store programmes on its 40gigabyte hard disk. The unit will also pause live TV. The hard disk can be used to store music as MP3 files. These can either be ripped from its CD player or downloaded from the net. The unit's home cinema facilities include a Dolby digital surround sound decoder and a DVD player. The basic Takami, which is accompanied by a remote control, wireless keyboard and stereo speakers, is on sale now for \u00a3999. Tiny is also offering the unit with a 15inch LCD screen for \u00a31,500. See www.tiny.com Smile and click Kodak has unveiled a system that it claims takes the hassle out of connecting a digital camera to a PC. EasyShare, which debuts on the company's just launched DX3500 model, pictured below, is based around an innovative docking station which not only connects the camera to the PC, but also automatically recharges its batteries. Once the software has been installed, users open up the software and transfer the image from the camera to the computer at a press of a button. With a couple of further button and mouse clicks, the user can email the images, print or edit them. Images are stored on an internal 8MB of memory. Further memory can be added with the addition of a CompactFlash card. The DX3500 has an image resolution of 2.2 megapixels and features a 3x digital zoom. It goes on sale later this month. In July it will be joined by the DDX3600 which adds a 2x optical zoom and digital video to the specification of its sibling model. Both models are also Mac compatible. www.kodak.co.uk Cut-price Intel Intel has slashed the price of 1.5GHz and 1.4GHz Pentium 4 processors following the introduction of the 1.7GHz version. The faster version has been launched at an unexpectedly low price: $352 compared with $519 for the 1.5GHz chip. On Monday Intel halved the price of the slower chips, with the 1.5GHz falling from $519 to $256, and the 1.4GHz falling from $375 to $193. However, Intel did not cut the price of Pentium III processors, and at $225, a 1GHz PIII now costs more than a faster P4. The 1.5GHz P4 has had its price cut three times in the past two months: earlier this year, it cost more than $800. Intel wants to move the PC market as rapidly as possible from the PIII to the P4, and is also under competitive pressure from AMD's Athlon and Duron processors, which can use cheaper memory chips.",

A trial, involving 200 people who'd suffered from a \"major depression\" for at least four weeks, found the herb was no better than a placebo.

The researchers received \"unrestricted funding\" from the drug company Pfizer, who also manufacture the pre scription anti-depressant Zoloft, along with a \"me-too\" herbal product containing St John's wort. It is also the latest in a series of drug company sponsored drug trials that have raised doubts about efficacy or safety of St John's wort. The researcher advises people currently taking the herbal extract to consider one of the \"two dozen prescription medications whose effectiveness has been proved\". </p> <p>Protecting the public from harmful or useless medicines is of course a laudable aim. But, quite apart from the fact that more than 20 other studies have found St John's wort to be beneficial for \"mild to moderate\" depression, the drug companies credentials in this field are not exactly impressive. For a start, as the recent South African court battles over patents and generic drugs for Aids illustrated, the companies are prepared to go to great lengths to protect their profits. The rising spending on St John's wort and other herbal remedies is certainly a threat. Even more pertinent is the growing concern, by both academic institutions and top medical journals, about the way drug companies are prepared to conceal or manipulate results that put their own products in an unfavourable light. </p> <p>Last autumn JAMA announced that the results of a trial into the effectiveness of an immune boosting drug were incomplete, because the unnamed drug company involved were withholding them. The trial had showed the drug to be ineffective and the company wanted the results suppressed. </p> <p>It was far from an isolated incident. Only last month the Lancet published a letter from a doctor claiming that the drug company Bayer, when asked for supplies of a certain drug so that he could run a trial on it, demanded he sign a letter promising not to reveal any results without their permission. The journal made this damning comment: \"The efforts by the drug companies to suppress, spin and obfuscate findings that do not support their commercial purposes was first revealed to their full lethal extent during the thalidomide tragedy.

      "bodyText": "T-Online, Europe's largest internet service provider, has failed to dispel doubts about its business model in its latest set of results. The Deutsche Telekom-owned company has promised to reduce its dependence on access fees, but its first quarter results showed a rise in turnover from charging customers to dial up to the internet. In a further blow to T-Online, it reported a steep fall in advertising and e-commerce turnover, which had been highlighted as one of the main alternatives to access revenue. Most of the company's 8.7m subscribers come from Germany, which provides 7.1m of its customers, with the rest in France, Spain and Portugal. T-Online said its operating loss for the first three months of the year was virtually unchanged from the previous quarter at \u00a341.6m. Advertising and e-commerce revenue shrank 36% to \u00a319.4m and access revenues climbed 22% to \u00a3150.3m. The company has lost its position as the darling of European ISP stocks and has been overtaken by Sardinian rival Tiscali. Analysts are plumping for Tiscali because it will be the first to turn profitable at the end of 2001 and has taken a leading role in consolidating an overcrowded sector. Mounting concern over the business models of ISPs, and doubts about whether the companies can survive on their own, has redirected the focus of investors towards profitability. T-Online's popularity has also been blighted by a series of high-level management disputes with its parent company, Deutsche Telekom, which resulted in the departure of several key executives last year. Ron Sommer, the chief executive of Deutsche Telekom, has parachuted in his own men to run the company, which has lessened T-Online's reputation as an independent company. It has also effectively ruled out the ISP's chances of offering voice services over the net, which would 'cannibalise' Deutsche Telekom's core fixed-line business. This blocks a potentially large revenue stream for T-Online, and underlines the difficulty it will have in diversifying sources of turnover.",

      "bodyText": "Social workers' reputations as bureaucratic, interfering busy-bodies is unfounded, according to a survey of public attitudes to the profession by the Scottish executive. The Scotland-wide poll, carried out as part of the first annual report of the social work services inspectorate (SWSI), found that 72% of people felt services were sensitive to individual need and 77% thought services were reliable and did what they said they would do. The survey also found a good awareness of services, with three-quarters of those surveyed knowing how to contact them should they need to, and 68% believing that social work services were quick to respond. But despite the apparently high public opinion of both services and professionals, local authorities were facing increasing problems in recruiting and holding onto staff. \"Unless the serious problems faced in recruiting and retaining staff are firmly and urgently addressed, locally and nationally, then services will deteriorate. For the many thousands who depend on them, and for their families, that would be tragic,\" the report says. Earlier this year a poll by the Local Government Association and Community Care magazine found social work's image at an all-time low with many people seeing them as interfering, ineffective and excessively bureaucratic. The SWSI's annual report includes a snapshot of services in each council to gain a comprehensive picture of social work services across Scotland. It found that social work had responded well to changes since local government reorganisation in 1996 by setting up new services, developing new partnerships and breaking down departmental boundaries. The report highlights the need to promote more \"enlightened entrepreneurship\" in social work, with new ideas too rarely taken on board and included in mainstream practice. \"Too often, schemes or projects are limited to pilots or single teams within authorities. People are sometimes reluctant to learn from professional colleagues outside the authority and too often other authorities' successful ways of working are dismissed for not having been developed locally.\" Chief social work inspector Angus Skinner said the survey's findings were encouraging because they showed what the public really thought of social work. \"There has been an image problem and it is very important that people working in the service understand that they are valued by the society in which they work.

      "body": "<p>I'd like to cover three topical issues that affect support for charities - the debate about \"too many charities\", the need for openness and accountability in the way in which charities operate, and the central importance of safeguarding charities' independence. Then I want to mention the enhanced work programme the Commission will be pursuing from the beginning of the next financial year with money from our successful bid in last year's Comprehensive Spending Review. Finally I'll announce two important developments in the area of investments.</p> <p>The first of my issues that affect support for charities is the view - one we hear quite a lot nowadays - that there are too many charities. This sounds straightforward -and worrying. But what does it mean? What concerns about charities does it express? And what should the response to these concerns be?</p> <p>There are a number of factors driving the perception. <br></p> <p> \u00b7 Firstly, the numbers, pure and simple. If you're told that there are 188,000 registered charities - or 4000 charities just in Devon, or 600 cancer charities, or 200 homelessness charities in London - you immediately struggle to imagine what each can possibly be doing that is distinctive. And if a charity's not doing anything distinctive, why does it need to exist separately from others doing much the same thing? <br> \u00b7 Secondly, many of the people who ask these questions - including donors - think the principle that \"two can live as cheaply as one\" holds good in some general sense for charities. The more separate charities there are, the more money they see as wasted. Wasted, that is, on the costs that each has to incur creating the administrative apparatus to sustain it in existence, and on promoting itself as a separate entity. <br>\u00b7 Thirdly, our postbag suggests that people's experiences of fundraising can add to the impression of a crowded - even overcrowded - charity field. Part of this is just a feeling that there is an awful lot of it about. But part of it is also a reaction against the way in which fundraising is sometimes done. The methods most often objected to are the ones seen by recipients as costly or wasteful, or as the product of an over-competitive or aggressive attitude. One of the conclusions that people draw, rightly or wrongly, from seeing aggressive competition between fundraising charities is that there are too many charities competing for too few funds. <br> \u00b7 Fourthly, some people think that it's too easy to set up a charity. The only legal requirement is for a constitution that contains exclusively charitable objects. You don't, for instance, need to provide any particular evidence of unmet need in the area in which the new charity is going to operate. There is a perception that some people set up their own charities, or continue the ones they are involved with, at least partly out of self-interest - they want their own organisation so that they can make sure things are done in the way they want.</p> <p>How should we react to these potentially damaging perceptions?</p> <p>Let's first have a look at some of the numbers and try to dispel a few myths. In round figures there are about 190,000 charities on the commission's register. Of these, about 30,000 are subsidiaries or constituents of a larger charity. They are registered in their own right because they typically have their own constitutions and funds. But they're not administratively separate - they have the same trustees as their parent charity and are run with it.</p> <p>That leaves about 160,000 main charities. I've seen estimates that 80% of voluntary organisations are volunteer-run as opposed to professionally run. That is, they have no paid staff and rely entirely on their trustees and other volunteers. This seems to match quite well with our own figures, which show that 67% of registered charities have an annual income under \u00a310,000 with 90% under \u00a3100,000. The income level of the typical charity just starting to take on paid staff thus looks to be of the order of \u00a330-40,000 - as one might have guessed. </p> <p>As well as the low costs that come from being volunteer-run, most charities below this size have something else that evidence suggests strongly appeals to contributors - a local character. Funds are spent where they are raised. Those who contribute to the charity can see what their contribution achieves.</p> <p>A figure of 125-130,000 volunteer-run local charities still sounds a lot, until you start adding up the various types: 2,300 recreation ground and playing field charities; 2,400 PTAs and Home School Associations; 5,300 village halls; and so on across the spectrum of community endeavour. </p> <p>All these charities are doing the same things as all the others of the same type, but are serving different communities. By and large there is no overlap, no duplication and little scope for cost-cutting. There might well be scope for finding ways to use resources more effectively, but that's not a \"numbers\" matter.</p> <p>That still leaves around 30,000 charities, including every charity represented here today I imagine, that are to a greater or lesser extent professionally run. It's the professionally run charities that are usually obliged to respond to the charges of duplication and waste, and over-aggressive fundraising. And, as I shall come to in a moment, it's the commission that has to reply to accusations that it's too easy to start up a charity (or, from other quarters, that it's too difficult to register a charity).</p> <p>One final point on numbers. The register doesn't inevitably increase every year. In our last reported financial year, 1999/2000, the register decreased by about 3,000 as we identified and removed a large number of inactive charities.</p> <p>There are three things that need to form the basis of a response to the concerns I've outlined.</p> <p>First, there are clear advantages to be had from a healthy plurality of charities. We need to hammer home these advantages with the public, not expect them to be taken as read. The service-user or beneficiary gains from the breadth of choice on offer. Charities can develop the capacity to specialise and to provide a personal service on a human scale. The precise interests of people who want to donate to, volunteer for, join, or support charities are also more likely to be satisfied when there are charities of all shades. And although I mentioned the unseemly side of over-competitiveness, one mustn't forget the benefits of competition in encouraging efficiency and attentiveness to users' needs.</p> <p>Secondly, we must acknowledge public concern about duplication and inefficiency, and show that we don't intend to tolerate them. Those of us running charities must be clearly seen to explore the scope for benefit from collaboration with other charities and organisations. There are big benefits of public confidence and support to be had from showing collaborative as opposed to over-competitive instincts. These are in addition to the concrete benefits can be realised in terms of reduced costs, enhanced income or improved services. </p> <p>What I am not saying is that everyone must rush out and try to merge with everyone else. What I am saying is that there is a very wide variety of possibilities for working better by working together. These range from modest ventures like shared helplines or the joint production of training material for professional staff through joint service-delivery units, purchasing consortia, joint flag days, appeals or advocacy campaigns on appropriate issues, combined grant administration, joint marketing initiatives, to partial or full mergers. </p> <p>Many of you are of course already very much alive to the possibilities and are benefiting from various types of collaborative ventures - but then you are a sophisticated and well-informed group. There are some examples of good quality information and guidance - NCVO's study on marketing collaborations; the Baring Foundation's guide to good practice in mergers; the Liverpool University guidance on legal aspects of merger. What doesn't exist at the moment, though, is a central repository of knowledge and information, and source of advice for charities, on collaborative working. To fill this gap CFDG, NCVO, ACEVO and ICFM, at the commission's suggestion, are putting together a study into the demand for, and feasibility of, such a service. The third part of our response is really to ask a question in return. If you are concerned that there are too many charities, how do you want to control and ration things? Who will decide which charities deserve to be allowed to start up or continue and which do not?</p> <p>Our national tradition is that any person can, without needing any permission from the state, lawfully join with others to form an association for purposes of public benefit. The role of the state, through the commission, is to confirm that the organisation meets the legal criteria that define charitable status, and to register the organisation so that it is monitored and has access to advice, and so that information about it comes into the public domain. We can't deny registration on any grounds other than failure to meet those legal criteria, and wouldn't want to have the power to do so. </p> <p>But there is an expectation, and not an unreasonable one, that we should intervene in some way if an organisation presents itself for registration and is evidently set up to fail. It's not rare for an intending charity to come to us with an impeccable constitution meeting all the legal criteria, but with over-ambitious goals, unrealistic ideas about the prospects for income generation, and inadequate governance arrangements. We could wave it through, watch it struggle along for a couple of years, then remove it from the register when it folds up. Or we could do what we already do - encourage the trustees to develop, before registration, sensible plans which are likely to give them a much better chance of achieving their aims. These might include considering whether in fact starting a new organisation is the best way of achieving aims - what about joining up with an existing organisation? </p> <p>I repeat that we can't and won't refuse registration on the grounds of poor planning. But we're equally convinced that it would be irresponsible of us, and wasteful of resources in the long run, not to do what we properly can to make sure that a charity starts off on a sound footing. One that's set up, to fail could waste donors', funders' and taxpayers' money, leave creditors unpaid, and tie up our resources.</p> <p>Finally, on the numbers game, there is one way in which charities can combat suggestions of waste and excessive numbers which is potentially as powerful as all the others put together. This is to tell the story, clearly, persuasively and professionally, of what they achieve for beneficiaries. The more the debate can focus on achievements - on outcomes, in the jargon, rather than on costs and other inputs - the better for public confidence in charity.</p> <p>Now, still on the theme of good communications, I want to make some points about openness and transparency. </p> <p>One of the differences between the old Statement of Recommended Practice on Accounting by Charities and the new SORP is the extra emphasis put on reporting. I mean reporting in the sense of painting a picture, in words as well as figures and in a way that people who are not financial experts can understand, of what the charity has used its resources for during the year, and what it has achieved. </p> <p>We especially hope that the trustees' report will become a key document. We have seen in the past too many so-called trustees' reports written in dusty and outdated audit-prose. Indeed the trustees might not have seen their report before the board meeting in which it was thrust in front of the chair with instructions to sign. Only in a limited sense can this be called the \"trustees'\" report. This is a plea for real trustees' reports.</p> <p>We see a variety of reactions from charities to public and media interest in administration and fundraising costs. </p> <p>Some charities react in a defensive way and seek to disclose little, usually for one of two reasons. Either the charity thinks that any unsolicited interest in its affairs is impertinent and unjustified - a reaction that we do still see from time to time from charities that are in the habit of calling themselves \"private\" charities. Or, far more commonly, the charity is worried that what it says will be misunderstood, taken out of context, or used to compare it unfavourably with other charities. </p> <p>These worries are understandable. But I'm sure that charities' interests are best served in the long run by adopting a culture of openness - a willingness to disclose, explain and justify - and worst served by a culture of defensiveness and \"keeping the head down\". </p> <p>In this connection there is one point that we need to be much less coy about. It is that good management and administration cost money. It's unrealistic to expect a large charity to run to the highest standards of efficiency and stewardship without recognising that it has to pay salaries that will attract and motivate the right staff, and has to pay open market rates for bought-in goods and services. </p> <p> Where a presumption seems to exist that people who work for charities ought to be prepared to work for next to nothing, or that charities should somehow be able to trade on their status to get goods and services at no cost, that needs to be challenged. </p> <p>In challenging it, however, we need to accept that the professionalisation of charity can give the impression of organisations that are moving away from their charitable roots. The same impression sometimes results from charities pursuing methods of fundraising that echo commercial sales practices. When people say things like \"charities are big businesses nowadays,\" they are articulating a specific sense of regret. This is the regret that some charities have grown impersonal as they have grown large, and that they have been unable to maintain a charitable way of doing things that distinguishes them from the hard ways of business - and, indeed, from the public sector.</p> <p>The third \"confidence\" issue that I want to address is independence. There is a widely held perception that part of the value of charity lies in it being independent of the state, on the one hand, and of business interests on the other. Charity is seen as being about altruism and the voluntary principle, not about carrying out governmental imperatives or serving the profit motive. And yet, increasingly, charity and the state and (to a lesser extent) charity and business interact at all sorts of levels, and in all sorts of ways.</p> <p>Most obviously, the contract culture involves charities co-operating with local authorities, and providing services under contract on behalf of local authorities.</p> <p>\u00b7 More and more local authorities, keen to obtain the fiscal and other benefits of charitable status, are setting up charities to manage their leisure centres or their museums or their housing stock.</p> <p>\u00b7 Business sponsors charity on an ever increasing scale. Cause-related marketing arrangements proliferate.</p> <p>\u00b7 Building societies have set up charities and insist that new savers and borrowers agree to donate to them any windfalls that may result from demutualisation.</p> <p>\u00b7 The governing bodies of charities increasingly include representatives of the funding bodies that support them.</p> <p>These developments are seen in some quarters as undermining the independence of charity. And it is certainly true that developments of this sort can pose a challenge to charities' independence. But it is a challenge that charities - and the legal framework that supports them - are able to meet.</p> <p>Of course, it is crucially important that charities - and those who have dealings with charities - should understand the framework within which charities operate and the ways in which charities are legally required to be independent. It is equally important that the public should be aware that independence continues to be an essential characteristic of charity, and should be able to see that independence when they look at charities in action.</p> <p>The guidance that we published in March on Charities and Independence emphasises the importance of independence as regards</p> <p>\u00b7 the purposes for which charities are established</p> <p>\u00b7 the way that charities are governed</p> <p>\u00b7 and the way that charities operate.</p> <p>The essential point is that charities must exist for charitable purposes only - not to carry out the wishes or policies of the state, or of business - not to carry out some hidden agenda of the charity's promoters - just to carry out charitable purposes.</p> <p>And it is for the trustees to decide how those charitable purposes are to be carried out, not some outside body. In making those decisions, the trustees must act solely in the interests of the charity, not in anyone else's interests. That means that, even if a trustee is appointed by a funding body, he or she isn't there to represent the funder's interests. It doesn't matter how an individual becomes a trustee. Once someone accepts trusteeship, as a trustee his or her loyalty must be to the charity.</p> <p>An important principle is that charity money can't be spent on things that should be paid for by government. At most, trustees can use charitable funds only to supplement the services that government must pay for. In our periodic MORI surveys of public attitudes there is some concern that charities are being required to pay for things that government should be paying for.</p> <p>Secondly, trustees can't just surrender their discretion. They have to decide who the charity is going to benefit and how. That means that joint projects can only get off the ground where what the funder wants coincides with what the trustees think will best achieve the charitiy's charitable purposes.</p> <p>It also means that trustees can't accept funding conditions that restrict their activities outside the funding agreement. They can't accept conditions, for example, that prevent them speaking out on behalf of their beneficiaries. In this context, the only constraints upon them are the restrictions - set out in the guidelines we publish - that limit the sort of political and campaigning activity that charities can engage in. One of these restrictions is the prohibition on engagement in any aspects of party politics, including - perhaps especially - at election time. Our evidence suggests that the public are generally happy with the way charities manage to stay out of politics in that sense. But it is equally clear the credibility of any charity getting improperly involved in party politics is likely to suffer at least in the short term and perhaps permanently.</p> <p>I want to turn now to the Commission's future work programme. </p> <p>Under the Chancellor's Comprehensive Spending Review the Commission has been given more funding to pursue some new initiatives, and to develop some of our existing functions. The funding amounts to an extra \u00a34m plus a year from April 2002.</p> <p>The first area I want to mention is a new kind of Commission report on charity practice. We already produce a comprehensive range of booklets and other guidance for trustees - our \"CC\" range alone runs to 58 titles. Our intention now is to publish broadly based studies of themes and issues to show how practice is matching up to the precept in our best practice guidance - what works well; where the pitfalls are; what lessons can be learnt.</p> <p>This will enable us, as the regulator, to put the spotlight, not just on the best practice that we want to encourage and celebrate, but also what needs to change and improve. The reports will continue to focus on core commission concerns in the areas of governance, finance, organisation and administration. They will not seek to get into best practice in particular areas of service provision. CDFG is among the bodies that we have already consulted in drawing up our proposals both for possible themes and for ways of approaching the production of these reports, and I am very grateful for their help and support.</p> <p>While the funding for these reports will not be available until April 2002 we intend to run two pilot studies this year. One of the pilots will look from the commission's regulatory viewpoint at trustee induction, including the selection and recruitment of trustees. </p> <p>The second pilot study will look at charities and commercial partnerships. This is a topic which is increasingly relevant as charities seek to secure additional funds, or further their aims, by working with a commercial partner. </p> <p>A significant part of the new money will be used to fund an enhanced programme of visits to charities by commission staff. From last month, we have started to phase in new-style \"review visits\" with the aim of increasing their impact as a regulatory tool, as well as improving our relationships with charities and our ability to monitor developing trends and issues. 150 of the new-style visits will be conducted before April 2002, when the full launch takes place. Thereafter, we plan to conduct 600 visits per year. The new programme will complement, not replace, our current outreach activities involving seminars, roadshows, surgeries and so on.</p> <p>Review visits will use a modular structure based on the best practice framework in the commission's booklet 'Hallmarks of a Well Run Charity'. As well as reviewing the charity's published accounts, reports and other documentation, our staff will talk to trustees and others about the charity's activities, trusts, governance, and internal controls. </p> <p>For most of you, a detailed risk assessment for your organisation will underpin your internal control framework. Many of you, in your annual report, are already referring - in line with Turnbull recommendations and the new SORP - to that assessment, confirming that systems have been established to mitigate major risks. Some of you will have access to an internal audit facility. All of you here today are likely to have external auditors.</p> <p>In framing our finance modules for the enhanced visits programme, we are looking at the steps the charity has taken to control risk, how it has responded to the findings of internal and external auditors, and the quality of financial controls in general. We don't want to duplicate work already carried out and won't be appearing on the scene to carry out an audit by another name. We will, however, want to see evidence of appropriate controls and sound financial management. When appropriate, a commission accountant will take part in the review visit.</p> <p>We want to make the visits valuable for individual charities, giving them reassurance that they are following good practice. To ensure mutual benefit, we will agree in advance with the charity an agenda that includes issues nominated by the charity and ones nominated by the commission. </p> <p>The detailed report that we will provide to the charity will be structured to indicate areas where the charity must take some action because the law specifically requires it; things to be considered because the law generally requires it; and recommendations for good practice. Some cross-cutting issues highlighted by visits will feed into the thematic reports I've just been describing.</p> <p>The extra funding also includes an extra \u00a31m a year which will enable us to increase our capacity to carry out statutory investigations. There will also be a project to enable clients to carry out all of their business with us electronically, if that is what they choose. </p> <p>I want to turn now to investments. Many of you will know that the commission has been looking at the treatment of investment returns. Specifically we have been considering whether endowed charities should be allowed to be more flexible in their treatment of investment returns. We've wanted to assess whether flexibility would lead to the better use of resources for the benefit of present and future beneficiaries. Charities and their financial advisers had been telling us for some time that the rules on the treatment of investment returns on capital funds were now so out of date that they often worked against the interests of beneficiaries.</p> <p>Last summer we sought views on this issue and received a large number of detailed submissions. These were helpful to us in thinking about the issues and we're grateful to everyone who put time and effort into giving us their views and ideas. The general thrust of these showed a high degree of support for our proposals.</p> <p>Since then we've been developing our approach to the question of how trustees could be given power to allocate investment returns in a flexible way. The introduction of such a power would enable charities more effectively to balance the needs of present and of future beneficiaries.</p> <p>I can confirm today that we are now willing to offer the trustees of endowed charities a power to allocate the total return received from investments at their discretion rather than in the way dictated by the standard rules. </p> <p>This power will enable charities to invest their funds in the way that they judge will produce the best returns for the charity, regardless of the form - capital or income - in which returns are received. It will also enable them to allocate the return between present and future beneficiaries in the way they consider best enables them to fulfil their duty to be fair to all beneficiaries. As with the use of any such powers, trustees must act prudently and reasonably and must use the power in the interests of the charity. The power will have to be given to charities one by one at their request - we can't introduce it in a blanket way.</p> <p>Trustees have an obligation to treat all their beneficiaries - present and future - fairly. The power will not remove or diminish that obligation.</p> <p>To ensure that the obligation is honoured, the power given to trustees will be subject to a number of directions. These are designed specifically to protect the interests of present and future beneficiaries, and to ensure that the wish of any donor wanting to establish an enduring charity can be upheld. The directions are key to the use of the power and take the form of duties that must be carried out before the power can be used. </p> <p>The directions require a duty of even-handedness and a duty of care similar to the duty of care in the new Trustee Act.</p> <p>Charities will also be under a duty to disclose publicly their use of the power. This was a point that was thought important by respondents to our consultation. The consensus was that disclosure of the use of the power would be an important feature in guarding against misuse. We agree.</p> <p>Obtaining professional investment advice will also be essential. It will give the trustees confidence that their overall pattern of investment and expenditure is sustainable.</p> <p>Under the new power, charities will have a wide discretion to allocate investment returns as they see fit, constrained only by the obligation to be even-handed. We will expect them to use the power in a way that doesn't prejudice the charity's ability to meet both present and future needs.</p> <p>The power doesn't, I stress, undermine the legal concept of permanent endowment - an endowment which can't be expended and must remain perpetually intact. Nor will the new power remove the ability of someone founding a charity to set it up in a permanently endowed form if he or she so wishes.</p> <p> We recognise the need for trustees to take a long-term view on the generation and the allocation of investment returns. The guidance we produce will therefore draw attention to the fact that investment returns and inflation fluctuate from year to year - if anyone needs to be reminded after the last few weeks, markets can go up and down in a volatile way. We will also in our guidance emphasise the duty to make fair decisions about the resources to be spent on current and future beneficiaries. </p> <p>We will be putting our guidance on the total return approach onto our website in the next week or so. </p> <p>One thing we are putting onto our website today is some guidance about charities' use of their funds for programme-related investment. A programme-related investment, a term that I want to make clear we didn't invent, is a form of social investment. It's a way of using funds to achieve charitable aims rather than to secure an investment return.</p> <p>Many charities, not just pure grant-makers, have the capacity to use their funds to make grants. But there's been some uncertainty about the extent to which charities can use their funds to make soft loans to, or equity investments in, businesses run for community benefit by social entrepreneurs.</p> <p>Our guidance has examples of the use of both income and capital funds for programme-related investment. Essentially we're saying that charities probably have more latitude to make programme-related investments than they might have thought - if indeed they'd thought about it at all. We hadn't thought about it ourselves before the chancellor's appointment last year of the Social Investment Task Force. It reported in October on ways of enabling under-invested communities to access investment funds. David Carrington, from whom we'll hear later, was a member of this Task Force.</p>",

      "bodyText": "I'd like to cover three topical issues that affect support for charities - the debate about \"too many charities\", the need for openness and accountability in the way in which charities operate, and the central importance of safeguarding charities' independence. Then I want to mention the enhanced work programme the Commission will be pursuing from the beginning of the next financial year with money from our successful bid in last year's Comprehensive Spending Review. Finally I'll announce two important developments in the area of investments. The first of my issues that affect support for charities is the view - one we hear quite a lot nowadays - that there are too many charities. This sounds straightforward -and worrying. But what does it mean? What concerns about charities does it express? And what should the response to these concerns be? There are a number of factors driving the perception. \u00b7 Firstly, the numbers, pure and simple. If you're told that there are 188,000 registered charities - or 4000 charities just in Devon, or 600 cancer charities, or 200 homelessness charities in London - you immediately struggle to imagine what each can possibly be doing that is distinctive. And if a charity's not doing anything distinctive, why does it need to exist separately from others doing much the same thing? \u00b7 Secondly, many of the people who ask these questions - including donors - think the principle that \"two can live as cheaply as one\" holds good in some general sense for charities. The more separate charities there are, the more money they see as wasted. Wasted, that is, on the costs that each has to incur creating the administrative apparatus to sustain it in existence, and on promoting itself as a separate entity. \u00b7 Thirdly, our postbag suggests that people's experiences of fundraising can add to the impression of a crowded - even overcrowded - charity field. Part of this is just a feeling that there is an awful lot of it about. But part of it is also a reaction against the way in which fundraising is sometimes done. The methods most often objected to are the ones seen by recipients as costly or wasteful, or as the product of an over-competitive or aggressive attitude. One of the conclusions that people draw, rightly or wrongly, from seeing aggressive competition between fundraising charities is that there are too many charities competing for too few funds. \u00b7 Fourthly, some people think that it's too easy to set up a charity. The only legal requirement is for a constitution that contains exclusively charitable objects. You don't, for instance, need to provide any particular evidence of unmet need in the area in which the new charity is going to operate. There is a perception that some people set up their own charities, or continue the ones they are involved with, at least partly out of self-interest - they want their own organisation so that they can make sure things are done in the way they want. How should we react to these potentially damaging perceptions? Let's first have a look at some of the numbers and try to dispel a few myths. In round figures there are about 190,000 charities on the commission's register. Of these, about 30,000 are subsidiaries or constituents of a larger charity. They are registered in their own right because they typically have their own constitutions and funds. But they're not administratively separate - they have the same trustees as their parent charity and are run with it. That leaves about 160,000 main charities. I've seen estimates that 80% of voluntary organisations are volunteer-run as opposed to professionally run. That is, they have no paid staff and rely entirely on their trustees and other volunteers. This seems to match quite well with our own figures, which show that 67% of registered charities have an annual income under \u00a310,000 with 90% under \u00a3100,000. The income level of the typical charity just starting to take on paid staff thus looks to be of the order of \u00a330-40,000 - as one might have guessed. As well as the low costs that come from being volunteer-run, most charities below this size have something else that evidence suggests strongly appeals to contributors - a local character. Funds are spent where they are raised. Those who contribute to the charity can see what their contribution achieves. A figure of 125-130,000 volunteer-run local charities still sounds a lot, until you start adding up the various types: 2,300 recreation ground and playing field charities; 2,400 PTAs and Home School Associations; 5,300 village halls; and so on across the spectrum of community endeavour. All these charities are doing the same things as all the others of the same type, but are serving different communities. By and large there is no overlap, no duplication and little scope for cost-cutting. There might well be scope for finding ways to use resources more effectively, but that's not a \"numbers\" matter. That still leaves around 30,000 charities, including every charity represented here today I imagine, that are to a greater or lesser extent professionally run. It's the professionally run charities that are usually obliged to respond to the charges of duplication and waste, and over-aggressive fundraising. And, as I shall come to in a moment, it's the commission that has to reply to accusations that it's too easy to start up a charity (or, from other quarters, that it's too difficult to register a charity). One final point on numbers. The register doesn't inevitably increase every year. In our last reported financial year, 1999/2000, the register decreased by about 3,000 as we identified and removed a large number of inactive charities. There are three things that need to form the basis of a response to the concerns I've outlined. First, there are clear advantages to be had from a healthy plurality of charities. We need to hammer home these advantages with the public, not expect them to be taken as read. The service-user or beneficiary gains from the breadth of choice on offer. Charities can develop the capacity to specialise and to provide a personal service on a human scale. The precise interests of people who want to donate to, volunteer for, join, or support charities are also more likely to be satisfied when there are charities of all shades. And although I mentioned the unseemly side of over-competitiveness, one mustn't forget the benefits of competition in encouraging efficiency and attentiveness to users' needs. Secondly, we must acknowledge public concern about duplication and inefficiency, and show that we don't intend to tolerate them. Those of us running charities must be clearly seen to explore the scope for benefit from collaboration with other charities and organisations. There are big benefits of public confidence and support to be had from showing collaborative as opposed to over-competitive instincts. These are in addition to the concrete benefits can be realised in terms of reduced costs, enhanced income or improved services. What I am not saying is that everyone must rush out and try to merge with everyone else. What I am saying is that there is a very wide variety of possibilities for working better by working together. These range from modest ventures like shared helplines or the joint production of training material for professional staff through joint service-delivery units, purchasing consortia, joint flag days, appeals or advocacy campaigns on appropriate issues, combined grant administration, joint marketing initiatives, to partial or full mergers. Many of you are of course already very much alive to the possibilities and are benefiting from various types of collaborative ventures - but then you are a sophisticated and well-informed group. There are some examples of good quality information and guidance - NCVO's study on marketing collaborations; the Baring Foundation's guide to good practice in mergers; the Liverpool University guidance on legal aspects of merger. What doesn't exist at the moment, though, is a central repository of knowledge and information, and source of advice for charities, on collaborative working. To fill this gap CFDG, NCVO, ACEVO and ICFM, at the commission's suggestion, are putting together a study into the demand for, and feasibility of, such a service. The third part of our response is really to ask a question in return. If you are concerned that there are too many charities, how do you want to control and ration things? Who will decide which charities deserve to be allowed to start up or continue and which do not? Our national tradition is that any person can, without needing any permission from the state, lawfully join with others to form an association for purposes of public benefit. The role of the state, through the commission, is to confirm that the organisation meets the legal criteria that define charitable status, and to register the organisation so that it is monitored and has access to advice, and so that information about it comes into the public domain. We can't deny registration on any grounds other than failure to meet those legal criteria, and wouldn't want to have the power to do so. But there is an expectation, and not an unreasonable one, that we should intervene in some way if an organisation presents itself for registration and is evidently set up to fail. It's not rare for an intending charity to come to us with an impeccable constitution meeting all the legal criteria, but with over-ambitious goals, unrealistic ideas about the prospects for income generation, and inadequate governance arrangements. We could wave it through, watch it struggle along for a couple of years, then remove it from the register when it folds up. Or we could do what we already do - encourage the trustees to develop, before registration, sensible plans which are likely to give them a much better chance of achieving their aims. These might include considering whether in fact starting a new organisation is the best way of achieving aims - what about joining up with an existing organisation? I repeat that we can't and won't refuse registration on the grounds of poor planning. But we're equally convinced that it would be irresponsible of us, and wasteful of resources in the long run, not to do what we properly can to make sure that a charity starts off on a sound footing. One that's set up, to fail could waste donors', funders' and taxpayers' money, leave creditors unpaid, and tie up our resources. Finally, on the numbers game, there is one way in which charities can combat suggestions of waste and excessive numbers which is potentially as powerful as all the others put together. This is to tell the story, clearly, persuasively and professionally, of what they achieve for beneficiaries. The more the debate can focus on achievements - on outcomes, in the jargon, rather than on costs and other inputs - the better for public confidence in charity. Now, still on the theme of good communications, I want to make some points about openness and transparency. One of the differences between the old Statement of Recommended Practice on Accounting by Charities and the new SORP is the extra emphasis put on reporting. I mean reporting in the sense of painting a picture, in words as well as figures and in a way that people who are not financial experts can understand, of what the charity has used its resources for during the year, and what it has achieved. We especially hope that the trustees' report will become a key document. We have seen in the past too many so-called trustees' reports written in dusty and outdated audit-prose. Indeed the trustees might not have seen their report before the board meeting in which it was thrust in front of the chair with instructions to sign. Only in a limited sense can this be called the \"trustees'\" report. This is a plea for real trustees' reports. We see a variety of reactions from charities to public and media interest in administration and fundraising costs. Some charities react in a defensive way and seek to disclose little, usually for one of two reasons. Either the charity thinks that any unsolicited interest in its affairs is impertinent and unjustified - a reaction that we do still see from time to time from charities that are in the habit of calling themselves \"private\" charities. Or, far more commonly, the charity is worried that what it says will be misunderstood, taken out of context, or used to compare it unfavourably with other charities. These worries are understandable. But I'm sure that charities' interests are best served in the long run by adopting a culture of openness - a willingness to disclose, explain and justify - and worst served by a culture of defensiveness and \"keeping the head down\". In this connection there is one point that we need to be much less coy about. It is that good management and administration cost money. It's unrealistic to expect a large charity to run to the highest standards of efficiency and stewardship without recognising that it has to pay salaries that will attract and motivate the right staff, and has to pay open market rates for bought-in goods and services. Where a presumption seems to exist that people who work for charities ought to be prepared to work for next to nothing, or that charities should somehow be able to trade on their status to get goods and services at no cost, that needs to be challenged. In challenging it, however, we need to accept that the professionalisation of charity can give the impression of organisations that are moving away from their charitable roots. The same impression sometimes results from charities pursuing methods of fundraising that echo commercial sales practices. When people say things like \"charities are big businesses nowadays,\" they are articulating a specific sense of regret. This is the regret that some charities have grown impersonal as they have grown large, and that they have been unable to maintain a charitable way of doing things that distinguishes them from the hard ways of business - and, indeed, from the public sector. The third \"confidence\" issue that I want to address is independence. There is a widely held perception that part of the value of charity lies in it being independent of the state, on the one hand, and of business interests on the other. Charity is seen as being about altruism and the voluntary principle, not about carrying out governmental imperatives or serving the profit motive. And yet, increasingly, charity and the state and (to a lesser extent) charity and business interact at all sorts of levels, and in all sorts of ways. Most obviously, the contract culture involves charities co-operating with local authorities, and providing services under contract on behalf of local authorities. \u00b7 More and more local authorities, keen to obtain the fiscal and other benefits of charitable status, are setting up charities to manage their leisure centres or their museums or their housing stock. \u00b7 Business sponsors charity on an ever increasing scale. Cause-related marketing arrangements proliferate. \u00b7 Building societies have set up charities and insist that new savers and borrowers agree to donate to them any windfalls that may result from demutualisation. \u00b7 The governing bodies of charities increasingly include representatives of the funding bodies that support them. These developments are seen in some quarters as undermining the independence of charity. And it is certainly true that developments of this sort can pose a challenge to charities' independence. But it is a challenge that charities - and the legal framework that supports them - are able to meet. Of course, it is crucially important that charities - and those who have dealings with charities - should understand the framework within which charities operate and the ways in which charities are legally required to be independent. It is equally important that the public should be aware that independence continues to be an essential characteristic of charity, and should be able to see that independence when they look at charities in action. The guidance that we published in March on Charities and Independence emphasises the importance of independence as regards \u00b7 the purposes for which charities are established \u00b7 the way that charities are governed \u00b7 and the way that charities operate. The essential point is that charities must exist for charitable purposes only - not to carry out the wishes or policies of the state, or of business - not to carry out some hidden agenda of the charity's promoters - just to carry out charitable purposes. And it is for the trustees to decide how those charitable purposes are to be carried out, not some outside body. In making those decisions, the trustees must act solely in the interests of the charity, not in anyone else's interests. That means that, even if a trustee is appointed by a funding body, he or she isn't there to represent the funder's interests. It doesn't matter how an individual becomes a trustee. Once someone accepts trusteeship, as a trustee his or her loyalty must be to the charity. An important principle is that charity money can't be spent on things that should be paid for by government. At most, trustees can use charitable funds only to supplement the services that government must pay for. In our periodic MORI surveys of public attitudes there is some concern that charities are being required to pay for things that government should be paying for. Secondly, trustees can't just surrender their discretion. They have to decide who the charity is going to benefit and how. That means that joint projects can only get off the ground where what the funder wants coincides with what the trustees think will best achieve the charitiy's charitable purposes. It also means that trustees can't accept funding conditions that restrict their activities outside the funding agreement. They can't accept conditions, for example, that prevent them speaking out on behalf of their beneficiaries. In this context, the only constraints upon them are the restrictions - set out in the guidelines we publish - that limit the sort of political and campaigning activity that charities can engage in. One of these restrictions is the prohibition on engagement in any aspects of party politics, including - perhaps especially - at election time. Our evidence suggests that the public are generally happy with the way charities manage to stay out of politics in that sense. But it is equally clear the credibility of any charity getting improperly involved in party politics is likely to suffer at least in the short term and perhaps permanently. I want to turn now to the Commission's future work programme. Under the Chancellor's Comprehensive Spending Review the Commission has been given more funding to pursue some new initiatives, and to develop some of our existing functions. The funding amounts to an extra \u00a34m plus a year from April 2002. The first area I want to mention is a new kind of Commission report on charity practice. We already produce a comprehensive range of booklets and other guidance for trustees - our \"CC\" range alone runs to 58 titles. Our intention now is to publish broadly based studies of themes and issues to show how practice is matching up to the precept in our best practice guidance - what works well; where the pitfalls are; what lessons can be learnt. This will enable us, as the regulator, to put the spotlight, not just on the best practice that we want to encourage and celebrate, but also what needs to change and improve. The reports will continue to focus on core commission concerns in the areas of governance, finance, organisation and administration. They will not seek to get into best practice in particular areas of service provision. CDFG is among the bodies that we have already consulted in drawing up our proposals both for possible themes and for ways of approaching the production of these reports, and I am very grateful for their help and support. While the funding for these reports will not be available until April 2002 we intend to run two pilot studies this year. One of the pilots will look from the commission's regulatory viewpoint at trustee induction, including the selection and recruitment of trustees. The second pilot study will look at charities and commercial partnerships. This is a topic which is increasingly relevant as charities seek to secure additional funds, or further their aims, by working with a commercial partner. A significant part of the new money will be used to fund an enhanced programme of visits to charities by commission staff. From last month, we have started to phase in new-style \"review visits\" with the aim of increasing their impact as a regulatory tool, as well as improving our relationships with charities and our ability to monitor developing trends and issues. 150 of the new-style visits will be conducted before April 2002, when the full launch takes place. Thereafter, we plan to conduct 600 visits per year. The new programme will complement, not replace, our current outreach activities involving seminars, roadshows, surgeries and so on. Review visits will use a modular structure based on the best practice framework in the commission's booklet 'Hallmarks of a Well Run Charity'. As well as reviewing the charity's published accounts, reports and other documentation, our staff will talk to trustees and others about the charity's activities, trusts, governance, and internal controls. For most of you, a detailed risk assessment for your organisation will underpin your internal control framework. Many of you, in your annual report, are already referring - in line with Turnbull recommendations and the new SORP - to that assessment, confirming that systems have been established to mitigate major risks. Some of you will have access to an internal audit facility. All of you here today are likely to have external auditors. In framing our finance modules for the enhanced visits programme, we are looking at the steps the charity has taken to control risk, how it has responded to the findings of internal and external auditors, and the quality of financial controls in general. We don't want to duplicate work already carried out and won't be appearing on the scene to carry out an audit by another name. We will, however, want to see evidence of appropriate controls and sound financial management. When appropriate, a commission accountant will take part in the review visit. We want to make the visits valuable for individual charities, giving them reassurance that they are following good practice. To ensure mutual benefit, we will agree in advance with the charity an agenda that includes issues nominated by the charity and ones nominated by the commission. The detailed report that we will provide to the charity will be structured to indicate areas where the charity must take some action because the law specifically requires it; things to be considered because the law generally requires it; and recommendations for good practice. Some cross-cutting issues highlighted by visits will feed into the thematic reports I've just been describing. The extra funding also includes an extra \u00a31m a year which will enable us to increase our capacity to carry out statutory investigations. There will also be a project to enable clients to carry out all of their business with us electronically, if that is what they choose. I want to turn now to investments. Many of you will know that the commission has been looking at the treatment of investment returns. Specifically we have been considering whether endowed charities should be allowed to be more flexible in their treatment of investment returns. We've wanted to assess whether flexibility would lead to the better use of resources for the benefit of present and future beneficiaries. Charities and their financial advisers had been telling us for some time that the rules on the treatment of investment returns on capital funds were now so out of date that they often worked against the interests of beneficiaries. Last summer we sought views on this issue and received a large number of detailed submissions. These were helpful to us in thinking about the issues and we're grateful to everyone who put time and effort into giving us their views and ideas. The general thrust of these showed a high degree of support for our proposals. Since then we've been developing our approach to the question of how trustees could be given power to allocate investment returns in a flexible way. The introduction of such a power would enable charities more effectively to balance the needs of present and of future beneficiaries. I can confirm today that we are now willing to offer the trustees of endowed charities a power to allocate the total return received from investments at their discretion rather than in the way dictated by the standard rules. This power will enable charities to invest their funds in the way that they judge will produce the best returns for the charity, regardless of the form - capital or income - in which returns are received. It will also enable them to allocate the return between present and future beneficiaries in the way they consider best enables them to fulfil their duty to be fair to all beneficiaries. As with the use of any such powers, trustees must act prudently and reasonably and must use the power in the interests of the charity. The power will have to be given to charities one by one at their request - we can't introduce it in a blanket way. Trustees have an obligation to treat all their beneficiaries - present and future - fairly. The power will not remove or diminish that obligation. To ensure that the obligation is honoured, the power given to trustees will be subject to a number of directions. These are designed specifically to protect the interests of present and future beneficiaries, and to ensure that the wish of any donor wanting to establish an enduring charity can be upheld. The directions are key to the use of the power and take the form of duties that must be carried out before the power can be used. The directions require a duty of even-handedness and a duty of care similar to the duty of care in the new Trustee Act. Charities will also be under a duty to disclose publicly their use of the power. This was a point that was thought important by respondents to our consultation. The consensus was that disclosure of the use of the power would be an important feature in guarding against misuse. We agree. Obtaining professional investment advice will also be essential. It will give the trustees confidence that their overall pattern of investment and expenditure is sustainable. Under the new power, charities will have a wide discretion to allocate investment returns as they see fit, constrained only by the obligation to be even-handed. We will expect them to use the power in a way that doesn't prejudice the charity's ability to meet both present and future needs. The power doesn't, I stress, undermine the legal concept of permanent endowment - an endowment which can't be expended and must remain perpetually intact. Nor will the new power remove the ability of someone founding a charity to set it up in a permanently endowed form if he or she so wishes. We recognise the need for trustees to take a long-term view on the generation and the allocation of investment returns. The guidance we produce will therefore draw attention to the fact that investment returns and inflation fluctuate from year to year - if anyone needs to be reminded after the last few weeks, markets can go up and down in a volatile way. We will also in our guidance emphasise the duty to make fair decisions about the resources to be spent on current and future beneficiaries. We will be putting our guidance on the total return approach onto our website in the next week or so. One thing we are putting onto our website today is some guidance about charities' use of their funds for programme-related investment. A programme-related investment, a term that I want to make clear we didn't invent, is a form of social investment. It's a way of using funds to achieve charitable aims rather than to secure an investment return. Many charities, not just pure grant-makers, have the capacity to use their funds to make grants. But there's been some uncertainty about the extent to which charities can use their funds to make soft loans to, or equity investments in, businesses run for community benefit by social entrepreneurs. Our guidance has examples of the use of both income and capital funds for programme-related investment. Essentially we're saying that charities probably have more latitude to make programme-related investments than they might have thought - if indeed they'd thought about it at all. We hadn't thought about it ourselves before the chancellor's appointment last year of the Social Investment Task Force. It reported in October on ways of enabling under-invested communities to access investment funds. David Carrington, from whom we'll hear later, was a member of this Task Force.",

      "body": "<p><strong>Afghanistan</strong><br> There are no domestic news media at all under the Taliban, which banned \"news which could hurt people's feelings\" in 1997. Most Afghans get information by word of mouth or from the BBC's daily Pashtu and Farsi services. The BBC's Kate Clark, the last foreign correspondent in Kabul, was given 24 hours to leave in March after she reported on the popular opposition to the Taliban's decision to blow up the magnificent standing Buddhas of Bamian, which were accused of \"distracting\" Moslems from Islam. <strong>Angola</strong><br> Efforts to report the civil war - or the widespread trafficking of diamonds it conceals - meet punitive sanctions from the government of President Eduardo dos Santos. In October, Rafael Marques was one of three independent journalists banned for five years from speaking in public, reporting or travelling abroad. <strong>Bangladesh</strong><br> Journalists are increasingly targeted under Prime Minister Sheik Hasina and the ruling Awami League. On July 16 last year, Shamsur Rahman, a regular BBC contributor, was shot dead in Jessore. On January 25, the hands and legs of the award-winning journalist, Tipu Sultan, were broken so badly by Awami thugs it was feared they would have to be amputated. <strong>Britain</strong><br> For generations, the Official Secrets Act has served as an all-purpose ban on the disclosure of the inner workings of government. It hangs by a thread following the spate of bad publicity generated by the former spies, David Shayler and Richard Tomlinson, the British author, Tony Geraghty, and his alleged source for his banned book, the Irish War, Nigel Wylde, and the forthcoming memoirs of the former spy chief, Stella Rimmington. A meeting of the Reform of the Official Secrets Act group will be held on May 3 in the Jubilee Room of the House of Commons. <strong>Burkina Faso</strong><br> Demonstrations continue to dog the government of this Sahelian state three years after the murder of the independent journalist, Norbert Zongo, in December 1998. Evidence points to the involvement of the president's brother, Francis Compaore, whom Mr Zongo had accused in print of murdering his own chauffeur. <strong>Burma</strong><br> One of the least free media environments in the world. Last September, the 77-year-old lawyer, Cheng Po, was sentenced to seven years in Rangoon's dreaded Insein prison merely for \"distributing\" foreign news articles. <strong>Chile</strong><br> Despite moves to prosecute the former president, Augusto Pinochet, \"offending\" the president, ministers, generals or judges is still punishable by up to five years in prison under the Domestic Security Law. In December, a judge upheld the arrest warrant on the exiled journalist, Alejandra Matus, whose banned book, Black Book of Chilean Justice, exposed the support given to General Pinochet by Chilean judges during the \"dirty war\". <strong>China</strong><br> Few Chinese could discern any improvement in press freedom last year. A torrent of hate messages were spread by the official media against the Falun Gong, a movement of physical exercise practitioners that has put the fear of God into the government. Members of the group - or \"sect\" as the government describes it - continued to be arrested, jailed and beaten in their thousands, while several score have died in custody. In a speech in January, President Jiang Zemin told media chiefs: \"The news media is the mouthpiece of the party and the people and should publicise the spirit of the part central committee in a precise, clear and vivid manner.\" The government considers the internet to be as direct a threat to its power as the Falun Gong, although web access is not widespread. Last year, Qi Yanchen was sentenced to an unspecified jail term for his contributions to the pro-democracy online magazine, VIP Reference. On 26 April 2001, Guo Qinghai was given four years for \"subversion\" as a result of his contributions to the website www.6-4tianwang.com. Chinese police hacked into foreign websites in order to track down Guo. <br><strong>Useful link</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.indexoncensorship.org/\" target=\"_NEW\">www.indexoncensorship.org</a> <br> <br> <strong>Colombia</strong><br> The most dangerous place in the world for journalists - 33 have been murdered there since 1991, mostly by the right wing paramilitary group, Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia, or guerillas of the leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia. On April 27, Flavio Bedoya, a 52-year-old journalist with the communist weekly, Voz, became the 11th victim in the past year. He was shot four times by unidentified men while stepping off a bus near the border with Ecuador.<br> <strong>Useful links</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.rsf.fr/\" target=\"_NEW\">www.rsf.org</a><br><a href=\"http://www.cpj.org/\" target=\"_NEW\">www.cpj.org</a><br> <br> <strong>Czech Republic</strong><br> Journalists occupied the premises of Czech TV over Christmas. They were protesting against political interference after the government imposed a new director less than a week after his predecessor was sacked. The government backed down after 100,000 people gathered on Wenceslas Square, although a new set of broadcasting laws have actually strengthened political control of the country's public television services. <br> <br> <strong>Egypt</strong><br> Fears of Islamic fundamentalism and the swelling tide of modernism led to a crackdown in 2000/01 that affected political reporting and mainstream publishing. The local correspondents of western news media were kicked and punched by police while they covered the campaigns of the banned Muslim Brotherhood candidates in the local elections on November 14. Charges of blasphemy, meanwhile, resulted in the torching of 6,000 books by the mediaeval poet, Abu Nawas, and the banning of Before and After by Tufiq Abderahman, Shivering of the Lights by Salaheddin Mohsen and A Banquet of Seaweed by Haidar Haidar. <br> <br> <strong>Ethiopa</strong><br> The country has the worst track record in Africa for jailing reporters. Garum Bekele, Tesfaye Deressa, Tamrat Gemeda and Solomon Namara have been in prison since 1997/98, while temporary detentions - usually for \"publishing unpatriotic information\" or \"inciting ethnic tensions\" - account for up to 15 more a year. Max Shine, the editor of Ethiop, is not expected to appear in court for two years following his arrest last November for an article about the war with Eritrea. <br> <br> <strong>Iran</strong><br> The three year flowering of free expression that followed the election of President Mohammed Katami in 1997 ended in 2000 when the conservatives gained the upper hand. A total of 30 liberal newspapers have been shut down - usually on grounds of \"insulting Islam\" or \"criticising the clergy\" - while editors and journalists have been sentenced to prison terms. The most significant of them was Akbar Ganji, who was sentenced to 10 years in prison and five years of internal exile for exposing the involvement of senior officials in the assassination of intellectuals in 1998. An exclusive interview with Mr Ganji forced the Guardian's Tehran correspondent, Genevieve Abdo, to flee the country on the night of February 2. <br> <br> <strong>Kenya</strong><br> Kenya is another African country whose leadership is increasingly out of step with the aspirations of its young population. It continues to prohibit privately owned radio stations \"except for the purposes of evangelisation\" and to repel the new freedoms of the internet. In December, the government ordered the closure of the Kenya Internet Exchange Point, only the second internet service provider to be set up in sub-Saharan Africa. <br> <br> <strong>Macedonia</strong><br> The government regularly tapped the phones of 25 journalists and 75 opposition figures after its near defeat in the September 2000 elections. This triggered a \"Macedonian Watergate\" when it was finally revealed to the public in January. One of those bugged, Julijama Kocovska-Krtolica of the daily paper, Denes, said: \"This is a sign our rulers have become so paranoid they are scared of anything that resembles democracy.\" <br> <br> <strong>Mozambique</strong><br> The normally quiet backwater of Maputo, the country's capital, was shocked from its torpor on November 22 by news of the assassination of Carlos Cardoso, the country's premier editor and journalist. Mr Cardoso, who was fatally ambushed near his office, had been investigating corruption surrounding the IMF-backed privatisation of a state-owned bank in 1997. <br> <br> <strong>Pakistan</strong><br> Popular support for the 1999 coup, led by General Parvez Musharraf, has waned as civil liberties, which were never strong, have declined. In September, military forces occupied the office of the Dawn Group of Newspapers in Karachi following the publication of an article entitled: \"Free press: is Musharraf having second thoughts?\". <br> <br> <strong>Peru</strong><br> Investigative print and radio journalists braved death threats, arbitrary prosecution and surveillance by the intelligence services throughout the rule of President Alberto Fujimori. After a rigged election last April, Mr Fujimori fell from power when a TV news programme aired video footage in November of his intelligence chief bribing an opposition congressman. Nevertheless, five journalists remain in prison. They have been convicted by one of the \"faceless courts\" - introduced by the former president to stem terrorism - of being involved with the rebel Shining Path movement. <br> <br> <strong>Russia</strong><br> President Vladimir Putin spent 2000 consolidating his power by reducing whatever freedoms the media had acquired under the former president, Boris Yeltsin. Any reports on the situation in Chechnya were made all but impossible after the kidnapping and charging of RFE/RL reporter Andrei Babitsky. The journalists, Grigory Pasko and Sergei Nitkin, were both prosecuted for espionage after revealing Russia's dreadful environmental problems. By January, the government had siezed control of Media-Most's NTV, Russia's only independent television network, along with the daily paper, Segodnya, and the Sem Dnei publishing house, which are all owned by the media magnate, Vladimir Gusinsky. Mr Gusinsky was forced to fight a well publicised case to prevent his extradition from Spain to Russia, where he faced trumped-up charges of fraud. By early 2001, the brief history of Russian independent journalism was on the wane. <br> <br> <strong>Serbia</strong><br> On September 6, pro-democracy activists liberated the offices of Radio B92, one of several members of the ANEM network of independent media. Throughout the Slobodan Milosevic era, this group struggled for impartial and objective reporting. Independent journalism played a crucial role in overthrow of Mr Milosevic. Despite repeated prosecution, police harassment, exemplary fines and the confiscation of their equipment, these media continued to publicise the realities of the Balkan wars and government corruption to all who would listen. Since the revolution of October 2000, collaborating journalists have been weeded out and restrictive media legislation removed from the statutes. <br> <br> <strong>Spain</strong><br> The only EU country where journalists are targeted for murder. On May 7 2000, assassins loyal to the Basque separatist group, Eta, shot dead Jose Luis Lopez de Lacalle, a columnist with El Mundo. Letterbombs were also sent to TV and radio journalists last year. Some 100 journalists currently live under police protection from the Eta death squads. <br> <br> <strong>Syria</strong><br> On April 20, journalist Nizar Nayouf, Syria's best known dissident, entered the second week of a hunger strike. It began after the authorities reversed a decision to release him from a 10 year prison sentence for \"disseminating false information\". Mr Nayouf, the former editor of Sawt al-Democratiyya (Democracy's Voice), suffers from leukemia and is partially paralysed from beatings received in prison. He is a winner of Unesco's World Press Freedom prize. <br> <br> <strong>Turkey</strong><br> The government's suppression of Kurdish rights - and its liberal use of the charge of \"insulting the military\" as a means of silencing critics - mean Turkey is low on the list of countries likely to join the EU. Last year, the regulatory Radio and Television Supreme Board passed temporary closure orders totalling 4,832 days \"or nearly 13.25 years\" on the nation's electronic media, according to a December report. Nadire Mater, the celebrated author of Mehmet's Book, a collection of interviews with Turkish conscripts, was only acquitted of insulting the military in September 2000 after an international outcry. <br> <br> <strong>Ukraine</strong><br> Georgy Goradze, the 31-year-old editor of the internet newsletter, Pravade Ukrayiny, disappeared on December 16 after complaining of police harassment over his allegations of government corruption. In December, secret tapes of conversations between President Leonid Kuchma and the interior minister, Yuri Kravchenko - in which they can be heard plotting Mr Goradze's assassination - came to light. Amid continuing political turmoil, forensic scientists in Germany and Ukraine are quarrelling over whether the headless corpse discovered near Kiev in late November is the body of the missing journalist. <br> <br> <strong>Zimbabwe</strong><br> President Robert Mugabe's attempt to cling on to power amid a mounting economic crisis met resistance from a wide array of Zimbabwean groups, most notably its fledgling but plucky free press. Efforts to silence the voice of the opposition culminated in January with the bombing of the printing works of Harare's best selling independent newspaper, Daily News. At the same time, Mercedes Sayagues, the correspondent for South Africa's Weekly Mail &amp; Guardian (which is part owned by the Guardian) and the BBC correspondent, Joseph Winter, were expelled from the country. The Daily News was back on the streets a day later with its trenchant criticisms of Zimbabwe's war in Congo, government corruption and attacks by the state on the independence of the judiciary. <br> <br> </p> <p><strong>Further reference</strong><br> Reaping the Whirlwind: the Taliban Movement in Afghanistan (Pluto Books April 2001), by Michael Griffin, the former assistant editor of the Index on Censorship</p> <p><strong>MediaGuardian.co.uk special report</strong><br> <a href=\"http://www.mediatheguardian.com/worldpressfreedomday/0,7522,481960,00.html\">World press freedom day</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "Afghanistan There are no domestic news media at all under the Taliban, which banned \"news which could hurt people's feelings\" in 1997. Most Afghans get information by word of mouth or from the BBC's daily Pashtu and Farsi services. The BBC's Kate Clark, the last foreign correspondent in Kabul, was given 24 hours to leave in March after she reported on the popular opposition to the Taliban's decision to blow up the magnificent standing Buddhas of Bamian, which were accused of \"distracting\" Moslems from Islam. Angola Efforts to report the civil war - or the widespread trafficking of diamonds it conceals - meet punitive sanctions from the government of President Eduardo dos Santos. In October, Rafael Marques was one of three independent journalists banned for five years from speaking in public, reporting or travelling abroad. Bangladesh Journalists are increasingly targeted under Prime Minister Sheik Hasina and the ruling Awami League. On July 16 last year, Shamsur Rahman, a regular BBC contributor, was shot dead in Jessore. On January 25, the hands and legs of the award-winning journalist, Tipu Sultan, were broken so badly by Awami thugs it was feared they would have to be amputated. Britain For generations, the Official Secrets Act has served as an all-purpose ban on the disclosure of the inner workings of government. It hangs by a thread following the spate of bad publicity generated by the former spies, David Shayler and Richard Tomlinson, the British author, Tony Geraghty, and his alleged source for his banned book, the Irish War, Nigel Wylde, and the forthcoming memoirs of the former spy chief, Stella Rimmington. A meeting of the Reform of the Official Secrets Act group will be held on May 3 in the Jubilee Room of the House of Commons. Burkina Faso Demonstrations continue to dog the government of this Sahelian state three years after the murder of the independent journalist, Norbert Zongo, in December 1998. Evidence points to the involvement of the president's brother, Francis Compaore, whom Mr Zongo had accused in print of murdering his own chauffeur. Burma One of the least free media environments in the world. Last September, the 77-year-old lawyer, Cheng Po, was sentenced to seven years in Rangoon's dreaded Insein prison merely for \"distributing\" foreign news articles. Chile Despite moves to prosecute the former president, Augusto Pinochet, \"offending\" the president, ministers, generals or judges is still punishable by up to five years in prison under the Domestic Security Law. In December, a judge upheld the arrest warrant on the exiled journalist, Alejandra Matus, whose banned book, Black Book of Chilean Justice, exposed the support given to General Pinochet by Chilean judges during the \"dirty war\". China Few Chinese could discern any improvement in press freedom last year. A torrent of hate messages were spread by the official media against the Falun Gong, a movement of physical exercise practitioners that has put the fear of God into the government. Members of the group - or \"sect\" as the government describes it - continued to be arrested, jailed and beaten in their thousands, while several score have died in custody. In a speech in January, President Jiang Zemin told media chiefs: \"The news media is the mouthpiece of the party and the people and should publicise the spirit of the part central committee in a precise, clear and vivid manner.\" The government considers the internet to be as direct a threat to its power as the Falun Gong, although web access is not widespread. Last year, Qi Yanchen was sentenced to an unspecified jail term for his contributions to the pro-democracy online magazine, VIP Reference. On 26 April 2001, Guo Qinghai was given four years for \"subversion\" as a result of his contributions to the website www.6-4tianwang.com. Chinese police hacked into foreign websites in order to track down Guo. Useful link www.indexoncensorship.org Colombia The most dangerous place in the world for journalists - 33 have been murdered there since 1991, mostly by the right wing paramilitary group, Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia, or guerillas of the leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia. On April 27, Flavio Bedoya, a 52-year-old journalist with the communist weekly, Voz, became the 11th victim in the past year. He was shot four times by unidentified men while stepping off a bus near the border with Ecuador. Useful links www.rsf.org www.cpj.org Czech Republic Journalists occupied the premises of Czech TV over Christmas. They were protesting against political interference after the government imposed a new director less than a week after his predecessor was sacked. The government backed down after 100,000 people gathered on Wenceslas Square, although a new set of broadcasting laws have actually strengthened political control of the country's public television services. Egypt Fears of Islamic fundamentalism and the swelling tide of modernism led to a crackdown in 2000/01 that affected political reporting and mainstream publishing. The local correspondents of western news media were kicked and punched by police while they covered the campaigns of the banned Muslim Brotherhood candidates in the local elections on November 14. Charges of blasphemy, meanwhile, resulted in the torching of 6,000 books by the mediaeval poet, Abu Nawas, and the banning of Before and After by Tufiq Abderahman, Shivering of the Lights by Salaheddin Mohsen and A Banquet of Seaweed by Haidar Haidar. Ethiopa The country has the worst track record in Africa for jailing reporters. Garum Bekele, Tesfaye Deressa, Tamrat Gemeda and Solomon Namara have been in prison since 1997/98, while temporary detentions - usually for \"publishing unpatriotic information\" or \"inciting ethnic tensions\" - account for up to 15 more a year. Max Shine, the editor of Ethiop, is not expected to appear in court for two years following his arrest last November for an article about the war with Eritrea. Iran The three year flowering of free expression that followed the election of President Mohammed Katami in 1997 ended in 2000 when the conservatives gained the upper hand. A total of 30 liberal newspapers have been shut down - usually on grounds of \"insulting Islam\" or \"criticising the clergy\" - while editors and journalists have been sentenced to prison terms. The most significant of them was Akbar Ganji, who was sentenced to 10 years in prison and five years of internal exile for exposing the involvement of senior officials in the assassination of intellectuals in 1998. An exclusive interview with Mr Ganji forced the Guardian's Tehran correspondent, Genevieve Abdo, to flee the country on the night of February 2. Kenya Kenya is another African country whose leadership is increasingly out of step with the aspirations of its young population. It continues to prohibit privately owned radio stations \"except for the purposes of evangelisation\" and to repel the new freedoms of the internet. In December, the government ordered the closure of the Kenya Internet Exchange Point, only the second internet service provider to be set up in sub-Saharan Africa. Macedonia The government regularly tapped the phones of 25 journalists and 75 opposition figures after its near defeat in the September 2000 elections. This triggered a \"Macedonian Watergate\" when it was finally revealed to the public in January. One of those bugged, Julijama Kocovska-Krtolica of the daily paper, Denes, said: \"This is a sign our rulers have become so paranoid they are scared of anything that resembles democracy.\" Mozambique The normally quiet backwater of Maputo, the country's capital, was shocked from its torpor on November 22 by news of the assassination of Carlos Cardoso, the country's premier editor and journalist. Mr Cardoso, who was fatally ambushed near his office, had been investigating corruption surrounding the IMF-backed privatisation of a state-owned bank in 1997. Pakistan Popular support for the 1999 coup, led by General Parvez Musharraf, has waned as civil liberties, which were never strong, have declined. In September, military forces occupied the office of the Dawn Group of Newspapers in Karachi following the publication of an article entitled: \"Free press: is Musharraf having second thoughts?\". Peru Investigative print and radio journalists braved death threats, arbitrary prosecution and surveillance by the intelligence services throughout the rule of President Alberto Fujimori. After a rigged election last April, Mr Fujimori fell from power when a TV news programme aired video footage in November of his intelligence chief bribing an opposition congressman. Nevertheless, five journalists remain in prison. They have been convicted by one of the \"faceless courts\" - introduced by the former president to stem terrorism - of being involved with the rebel Shining Path movement. Russia President Vladimir Putin spent 2000 consolidating his power by reducing whatever freedoms the media had acquired under the former president, Boris Yeltsin. Any reports on the situation in Chechnya were made all but impossible after the kidnapping and charging of RFE/RL reporter Andrei Babitsky. The journalists, Grigory Pasko and Sergei Nitkin, were both prosecuted for espionage after revealing Russia's dreadful environmental problems. By January, the government had siezed control of Media-Most's NTV, Russia's only independent television network, along with the daily paper, Segodnya, and the Sem Dnei publishing house, which are all owned by the media magnate, Vladimir Gusinsky. Mr Gusinsky was forced to fight a well publicised case to prevent his extradition from Spain to Russia, where he faced trumped-up charges of fraud. By early 2001, the brief history of Russian independent journalism was on the wane. Serbia On September 6, pro-democracy activists liberated the offices of Radio B92, one of several members of the ANEM network of independent media. Throughout the Slobodan Milosevic era, this group struggled for impartial and objective reporting. Independent journalism played a crucial role in overthrow of Mr Milosevic. Despite repeated prosecution, police harassment, exemplary fines and the confiscation of their equipment, these media continued to publicise the realities of the Balkan wars and government corruption to all who would listen. Since the revolution of October 2000, collaborating journalists have been weeded out and restrictive media legislation removed from the statutes. Spain The only EU country where journalists are targeted for murder. On May 7 2000, assassins loyal to the Basque separatist group, Eta, shot dead Jose Luis Lopez de Lacalle, a columnist with El Mundo. Letterbombs were also sent to TV and radio journalists last year. Some 100 journalists currently live under police protection from the Eta death squads. Syria On April 20, journalist Nizar Nayouf, Syria's best known dissident, entered the second week of a hunger strike. It began after the authorities reversed a decision to release him from a 10 year prison sentence for \"disseminating false information\". Mr Nayouf, the former editor of Sawt al-Democratiyya (Democracy's Voice), suffers from leukemia and is partially paralysed from beatings received in prison. He is a winner of Unesco's World Press Freedom prize. Turkey The government's suppression of Kurdish rights - and its liberal use of the charge of \"insulting the military\" as a means of silencing critics - mean Turkey is low on the list of countries likely to join the EU. Last year, the regulatory Radio and Television Supreme Board passed temporary closure orders totalling 4,832 days \"or nearly 13.25 years\" on the nation's electronic media, according to a December report. Nadire Mater, the celebrated author of Mehmet's Book, a collection of interviews with Turkish conscripts, was only acquitted of insulting the military in September 2000 after an international outcry. Ukraine Georgy Goradze, the 31-year-old editor of the internet newsletter, Pravade Ukrayiny, disappeared on December 16 after complaining of police harassment over his allegations of government corruption. In December, secret tapes of conversations between President Leonid Kuchma and the interior minister, Yuri Kravchenko - in which they can be heard plotting Mr Goradze's assassination - came to light. Amid continuing political turmoil, forensic scientists in Germany and Ukraine are quarrelling over whether the headless corpse discovered near Kiev in late November is the body of the missing journalist. Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe's attempt to cling on to power amid a mounting economic crisis met resistance from a wide array of Zimbabwean groups, most notably its fledgling but plucky free press.

      "body": "<p>The idea of turning London into a life-sized Monopoly board on May Day sounded like a great idea to me. The most familiar criticism lobbed at modern protesters is that they lack focus and clear goals such as \"Save the trees\", or \"Drop the debt\". And yet these protests are a response to the limitations of single-issue politics. Tired of treating the symptoms of an economic model - under-funded hospitals, homelessness, widening disparity, exploding prisons, climate change - there is now a clear attempt to \"out\" the system behind the symptoms. But how do you hold a protest against abstract economic ideas without sounding either hideously strident or all over the map?</p> <p>How about using the board game that has taught generations of kids about land ownership? The organisers of yesterday's Mayday Monopoly protest issued annotated maps of London featuring such familiar sites as Regent Street, Pall Mall and Trafalgar Square, encouraging participants to situate their May Day actions on the Monopoly board. Want to protest against privatisation? Go to a railway station. Industrial agriculture? McDonald's. Fossil fuels? The electric company. And always carry your \"Get out of jail free\" card.</p> <p>The problem was that by yesterday afternoon, London didn't look like an ingenious mix of popular education and street theatre. It looked pretty much like every other mass protest these days: demonstrators penned in by riot gear, smashed windows, boarded-up shops, running fights with police. And in the pre-protest media wars, there was more d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. Were protesters planning violence? Would the presence of 6,000 police officers itself provoke violence? Why won't all the protesters condemn violence? Why does everybody always talk about violence?</p> <p>It seems this is what protests look like today. Let's call it McProtest, because it's becoming the same all over. And of course this here is becoming a kind of McColumn, because I've written about all this before. In fact, almost all my recent columns have been about the right to assembly, security fences, tear gas, and dodgy arrests. Or else they've attempted to dispel wilful representations of the protesters - for instance, that they are \"anti-trade\", or longing for a pre-agrarian utopia.</p> <p>It is an article of faith in most activist circles that mass demonstrations are always positive: they build morale, display strength, attract media attention. But what seems to be getting lost is that demonstrations aren't themselves a movement. They are only flashy displays of everyday movements, grounded in schools, workplaces, and neighbourhoods. Or at least they should be.</p> <p>I keep thinking about the historic day, on March 11, when the Zapatista commanders entered Mexico City. This was an army that led a successful uprising against the state. And yet the residents of Mexico City didn't quake in fear - rather, 200,000 of them came out to greet the Zapatistas, including entire families. Streets were closed to traffic, yet no one seemed even slightly concerned about the inconvenience to commuters. And shopkeepers didn't board up their windows; they held \"revolution\" sidewalk sales.</p> <p>Is this because the Zapatistas are less dangerous than a few urban anarchists in white overalls? Hardly. It was because the march on Mexico City was seven years in the making (some would say 500 years, but that's another story). Years of building coalitions with other indigenous groups, with workers in the Maquiladoras, with students, with intellectuals and journalists; years of mass consultations, of open encuentros (meetings) of 6,000 people. The event in Mexico City wasn't the movement; it was only a very public demonstration of all that invisible, daily work.</p> <p>The most powerful resistance movements are always deeply rooted in community - and are accountable to those communities. However, one of the greatest challenges of living in the high consumer culture that was protested against in London yesterday, is the reality of rootlessness. Few of us know our neighbours, talk about much more than shopping at work, or have time for community politics. How can a movement be accountable when communities are fraying?</p> <p>Within a context of urban rootlessness, there are clearly moments to demonstrate, but perhaps more importantly, there are moments to build the connections that make demonstration something more than theatre. There are times when radicalism means standing up to the police, but there are many more times when it means talking to your neighbour.</p> <p>The issues behind Tuesday's demonstrations are no longer marginal. Yet something is gravely wrong when the protests still seem deracinated, cut off from urgent daily concerns. It means that the spectacle of displaying a movement is getting confused with the less glamorous business of building one.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p> <p><b>The London May Day protests at a glance</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/story/0,7369,481318,00.html\">Minute-by-minute coverage of the demonstrations</a></p> <p><b>Audio reports</b><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/audio2001/0501vidal.ra\">John Vidal witnesses a party atmosphere outside McDonald's in King's Cross, London (1min 45)</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/audio2001/0501left.ra\">Sarah Left on the Critical Mass cycle ride (2mins)</a></p> <p><b>Caption competition</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/graphic/0,7367,481420,00.html\">Send us a caption for this May Day picture and win a prize</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mayday/story/0,7369,482007,00.html\">02.05.2001: We're not revolting, but do we protest too much?</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mayday/story/0,7369,481858,00.html\">02.05.2001: May Day clear-up begins</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/story/0,7369,481753,00.html\">02.05.2001: Police trap for protesters</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/story/0,7369,481728,00.html\">02.05.2001, comment: Why I was there</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/story/0,7369,481751,00.html\">02.05.2001: A day of skirmishes then stalemate</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/story/0,7369,481626,00.html\">02.05.2001, leader: Taking to the streets</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/story/0,7369,481660,00.html\">02.05.2001, analysis: Global's good side</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/story/0,7369,481739,00.html\">02.05.2001, comment: In place of violence</a><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/story/0,7369,481481,00.html \">01.05.2001: May Day could cost millions</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/story/0,7369,481319,00.html\">01.05.2001: May Day protests grip London</a><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/story/0,7369,481407,00.html\">01.05.2001: May Day mood begins to darken</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/story/0,7369,480988,00.html\">01.05.2001, comment: Politics not parliament</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/story/0,7369,481222,00.html\">01.05.2001: Blair attacks 'spurious' May Day protest</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/story/0,7369,481125,00.html\">01.05.2001: Confusion reigns as police brace for mayhem</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/story/0,7369,481096,00.html\">01.05.2001, comment: Violence is our enemy</a></p> <p><b>Photo galleries</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/gall/0,8542,481316,00.html\">Pictures of today's protests in London</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/gall/0,8542,481339,00.html\">Pictures of today's protests around the world</a></p> <p><b>Interactive guide</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/flash/0,7365,477858,00.html \">Interactive guide to global protests </a><br></p> <p><b>Maps</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/graphic/0,7367,480993,00.html\">What's happened so far</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/graphic/0,7367,481480,00.html\">What's going on in Oxford Street</a></p> <p><b>How the Guardian is covering May Day</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/story/0,7369,481267,00.html\">01.05.2001: Keeping a level head</a></p> <p><b>Weblog special</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/weblogindex2/0,6799,475360,00.html\">May Day 2001</a></p> <p><b>The issue explained </b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/story/0,7369,481489,00.html\">History of anti-capitalism protests</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theissues/article/0,6512,479726,00.html\">The May Day protests</a></p> <p><b>Talk about it</b><br> <a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee81d50/0\">What do you think?</a></p> <p><b>Special reports</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/\">May Day 2001 </a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/globalisation/ \">Globalisation </a></p> <p><b>Net notes</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/netnotes/article/0,6729,214862,00.html \">May Day protests -

And yet the residents of Mexico City didn't quake in fear - rather, 200,000 of them came out to greet the Zapatistas, including entire families. Streets were closed to traffic, yet no one seemed even slightly concerned about the inconvenience to commuters. And shopkeepers didn't board up their windows; they held \"revolution\" sidewalk sales. Is this because the Zapatistas are less dangerous than a few urban anarchists in white overalls? Hardly. It was because the march on Mexico City was seven years in the making (some would say 500 years, but that's another story). Years of building coalitions with other indigenous groups, with workers in the Maquiladoras, with students, with intellectuals and journalists; years of mass consultations, of open encuentros (meetings) of 6,000 people. The event in Mexico City wasn't the movement; it was only a very public demonstration of all that invisible, daily work. The most powerful resistance movements are always deeply rooted in community - and are accountable to those communities. However, one of the greatest challenges of living in the high consumer culture that was protested against in London yesterday, is the reality of rootlessness. Few of us know our neighbours, talk about much more than shopping at work, or have time for community politics. How can a movement be accountable when communities are fraying? Within a context of urban rootlessness, there are clearly moments to demonstrate, but perhaps more importantly, there are moments to build the connections that make demonstration something more than theatre. There are times when radicalism means standing up to the police, but there are many more times when it means talking to your neighbour. The issues behind Tuesday's demonstrations are no longer marginal. Yet something is gravely wrong when the protests still seem deracinated, cut off from urgent daily concerns. It means that the spectacle of displaying a movement is getting confused with the less glamorous business of building one. comment@theguardian.com The London May Day protests at a glance Minute-by-minute coverage of the demonstrations Audio reports John Vidal witnesses a party atmosphere outside McDonald's in King's Cross, London (1min 45) Sarah Left on the Critical Mass cycle ride (2mins) Caption competition Send us a caption for this May Day picture and win a prize Related articles 02.05.2001: We're not revolting, but do we protest too much? 02.05.2001: May Day clear-up begins 02.05.2001: Police trap for protesters 02.05.2001, comment: Why I was there 02.05.2001: A day of skirmishes then stalemate 02.05.2001, leader: Taking to the streets 02.05.2001, analysis: Global's good side 02.05.2001, comment: In place of violence 01.05.2001: May Day could cost millions 01.05.2001: May Day protests grip London 01.05.2001: May Day mood begins to darken 01.05.2001, comment: Politics not parliament 01.05.2001: Blair attacks 'spurious' May Day protest 01.05.2001: Confusion reigns as police brace for mayhem 01.05.2001, comment: Violence is our enemy Photo galleries Pictures of today's protests in London Pictures of today's protests around the world Interactive guide Interactive guide to global protests Maps What's happened so far What's going on in Oxford Street How the Guardian is covering May Day 01.05.2001: Keeping a level head Weblog special May Day 2001 The issue explained History of anti-capitalism protests The May Day protests Talk about it What do you think?

And immigration.</p> <p>All Americans, except for the one in eight who are descended from African slaves, are either immigrants or the descendants of immigrants. So it is not surprising that most Americans, most of the time, regard immigration fondly. But what is not widely understood in Britain is that the character of American immigration, and therefore the character of American society, were dramatically changed by a piece of legislation proposed and passed almost in a fit of absentmindedness 36 years ago.</p> <p>In 1965, the same year in which African-Americans were assured of the right to vote, President Lyndon Johnson signed his name to another piece of legislation that would in the long run change the character of the American population as much as the former act would transform its politics. This was the Hart-Celler Immigration and Nationality Act. (Strictly speaking, it consisted of amendments to the McCarran- Walter Act of 1952.) Essentially it overturned previous legislation that had discriminated against immigrants from anywhere but northern Europe, and opened the golden door, as Americans call it, equally to migrants from every continent.</p> <p>It was an act of public policy whose consequences, if not wholly unintended, were certainly not clearly foreseen. For the 1965 legislation, motivated by a wish merely to correct an injustice as between two groups of immigrants from Europe, ended up by setting off what has come to be called the second great migration. In the long run, it is possible that it will end the predominantly European character of the American population.</p> <p>Most Americans do not interpret this momentous change, as Margaret Thatcher might, in terms of their being \"swamped\" by aliens, or of waking up, like William Hague, to find themselves in a \"foreign land\". They see the second great migration as strengthening their country and fulfilling its historic destiny to be a world society. The transformation of tens of millions of people, most of them from Asia and Latin America, into Americans is for them, not a matter for fear or resentment, but a cause for pride.</p> <p>It was not always so. In the late 19th century, migration to the United States grew with an accelerating rhythm, bringing settlers from Asia and from southern and eastern Europe instead of the English, Irish, Germans and Scandinavians who had made up the bulk of earlier waves of immigration. The shift was quite sudden. In 1882, just under 650,000 immigrants arrived in the United States, of whom only 13% came from the south and east of Europe. By 1907, 81% of the 1.2m who immigrated in that year came from those countries.</p> <p>The migrants of the first three-quarters of the 19th century, like the 4m white people who lived in the United States at the time of the first census in 1791, were largely Protestants; and the largest Roman Catholic group, the Irish Catholics, were English speaking and all too familiar with Anglo-Saxon politics and ways. The new immigrants from Austria-Hungary, Russia and Italy, many of them Roman Catholics, some Orthodox Christians, and a significant minority Jews, were culturally more \"different\". Their arrival provoked a revival of \"nativism\". The American majority responded angrily. Pressure built up steadily for restriction of the \"wrong\" kind of immigrants.</p> <p>In intellectual circles, there was much genteel racism, based on measurement of people's skulls and suchlike pseudo-scientific nonsense. In popular papers, the stereotyping was less refined. Prejudice against Asians, Catholics and Jews was rampant. There was widespread fear that immigrants of \"inferior stocks\" would bring with them disease, madness and \"degeneracy\". Chinese immigration was restricted as early as 1886, and Japanese immigration by a \"gentleman's agreement\" of 1907. In 1924 Congress, surrendering to the public mood, passed the Johnson-Reed Act of 1924. Once it came into full effect, from 1929, it established quotas on the basis of the national origins of the population of the United States as of the census of 1920. Total immigration was to be limited to 150,000 people a year, of which more than half would be allotted to applicants from Great Britain, Ireland and Germany; the annual quota for most individual non-European countries was set at an insulting 100.</p> <p>This quota system was reinstated, with minor adjustments, by the McCarran-Walter Act. It was the Kennedy administration, led by a family with a strong immigrant consciousness, and with many Jews and Catholics in influential positions, that decided to tidy things up. However, the legislation Johnson signed was seen as abolishing a historic injustice, not as introducing a historic change.</p> <p>Yet that is exactly what the 1965 legislation achieved. The first great migration, which produced the backlash that led to the 1924 crackdown, has already been exceeded in numbers by a second great migration. In 35 years this new flood has already brought more than 30m immigrants to America. Just over half of them were born in Latin America, almost exactly a quarter in Asia, and fewer than one in six in Europe. Indeed, probably because living standards in Europe have risen since 1945, taking the period as a whole, even more dramatically than in the United States, emigration from western Europe has virtually dried up.</p> <p>By the end of the 20th century, the new immigration was running at the rate of almost 1m legal and about one-third of a million illegal immigrants each year. Yet so far it has produced almost no backlash. No doubt the rhetoric of the Statue of Liberty and the golden door ignores the painful experience that immigration represented, especially for the first generation of migrants. That rhetoric ignores, too, the fact that, in the second migration as well as in the first, roughly a third of the immigrants went home.</p> <p>There have been instances of anger directed at specific groups of immigrants at particular times and in particular places. Korean shopkeepers were singled out by the (largely black) rioters in the 1994 Rodney King riots in Los Angeles.

The media celebrate the high proportion of Indians in the computer industry, the proportion of scholarship winners at great universities who are of Chinese or Japanese descent. There is a recognition that immigrant workers contribute to the American economy, whether they are computer programmers from Bangalore or road gangs from Honduras.

      "bodyText": "China warned the US yesterday that President George Bush's \"Son of Star Wars\" missile defence plan could set off a new arms race. Russia and America's European allies masked their deep concern about the project by a more diplomatic stance. The widespread scepticism in Europe about the need for such an ambitious, expensive, and - in the view of many - hugely destabilising system was reflected even by the British government, America's closest ally. In a remarkably lukewarm response to the plan Mr Bush outlined in a speech in Washington on Tuesday, Tony Blair told the Commons it was too early to say whether Britain would support the US on this \"highly sensitive\" issue. Taunted by the Conservative leader, William Hague, for dodging the issue, he replied: \"It is important and right that we wait for a firm proposal before giving a firm decision.\" Britain will be at the forefront of the project which, in all but one of its proposed formats, will involve the US eavesdropping centre at Menwith Hill, near Harrogate, an upgraded US early warning radar at Fylingdales on the North York Moors, and a new 6.8-hectare (17-acre) X-band radar nearby. Privately, ministers say Britain will have to let these bases be used. But Washington has let them off the hook for the time being by proposing a \"multi-layered\" project. A \"theatre-based\" system to intercept North Korean missiles from US ships in nearby waters or Iraqi missiles with land-based interceptors in Turkey might not involve radar stations in Britain. China, fast becoming America's leading strategic antagonist, said the project violated the anti-ballistic-missile treaty [signed by Moscow and Washington in 1972], would destroy the balance of international security forces and could cause a new arms race. But the Russian foreign minister, Igor Ivanov, while describing the ABM treaty as a key part of global security, said he was ready for talks with the US on new structures for international defence. International security pacts agreed since then were extremely complicated. \"That is why we are so insistent in keeping and strengthening ABM,\" he said, adding that Russia was \"ready for consultations, we are ready to set out our position\". Moscow has told European members of Nato that it is ready to discuss a regional missile defence system as an alternative to the continental shield Washington says could be extended to Europe. While the Europeans recognise the potential threat posed by what Washington used to call \"rogue states\" and now refers to as \"states of concern\" they believe the US is exaggerating the likelihood of them risking huge retaliation by firing missiles at the US. The foreign secretary, Robin Cook, maintains that it is far more sensible to try to engage in dialogue with these regimes - he says it is in Britain's strategic national interest - and defence sources confirmed yesterday that Whitehall does not see any threat to Britain from rogue states. The Nato secretary-general, Lord Robertson, said Mr Bush was right to focus on new challenges, and welcomed his commitment to close consultation with allies. The German foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, said that to avoid a global or regional arms race, cooperation which brought in Russia and China was necessary. Jesse Helms, chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee, was predictably enthusiastic. \"I greatly admire President Bush for his commitment to defend the American people against ballistic missile attack,\" he said. \"I expect that our allies will be strongly supportive.\" But the Democrat leader in the lower house, Dick Gephardt, said: \"By announcing his intent to move forward with as yet unproven, costly and expansive national missile defence systems, the president is jeopardising an arms control framework that has served this nation and the world well for decades.\" The independent defence analyst Sir Timothy Garden, a former senior RAF officer now attached to King's College, London, said: \"It is sad that all the hard work to control nuclear weapons around the world is likely to be undermined by the Bush proposals.\" \u0095 The veteran peace protester Anni Rainbow was arrested for obstruction at Menwith Hill yesterday during a protest against the project.

John Owen, the forum's European director, says editors should take \"better care of their own local stringers, translators and fixers\". And in an article in a MediaGuardian.co.uk special report on press freedom, he urges the journalists to use their publications and airwaves to \"condemn attacks on local journalists\". Mr Owen notes that the recent coverage of the wounding of the Sunday Times's Marie Colvin has drawn attention to what can be done to journalists in the name of censorship of freedom of speech. But he stressed the importance of highlighting the plight of local journalists, working outside the spotlight of the world's media, whose disappearance can go unnoticed. In particular, he writes, the recent murder of the BBC's local correspondent in Jaffna, Mylvaganam Nimalarajan, got no coverage in the British press. In many countries being a journalist can lead to torture, expulsion or death; in some it is outlawed altogether. The right to work, taken for granted in Britain, is a luxury for journalists in dozens of countries around the world. The Taliban has outlawed all domestic news media on the basis that it \"hurts people's feelings\", while the atrocities it perpetrates against Afghan citizens go unreported. Colombia is officially the most dangerous place in the world to be a journalist, with 33 murders of journalists reported since 1991. Meanwhile, journalists who go missing while reporting on the war in Chechnya can simply \"disappear\" without a trace, as demonstrated by Russian journalist Anna Politkovskaya. Last year, 52 journalists were murdered in 26 countries around the world, while over 70 are still detained in prison for articles they have written. Our special reports on Press Freedom Day are designed to show British journalists why they should, as Mr Owen says \"suspend their usual cynicism and self-promotion\" to defend their trade and the right to free speech. Because, as is demonstrated in our round-up of the world's flashpoints, British freedom of the press cannot be taken for granted. MediaGuardian.co.uk special report World press freedom day",

But following a series of protests from feminist and family groups, the French government is to crack down on the advertising industry to mend its ways. Government ministers next month will host a round table on sexual imagery and violence in television advertising. TV executives, advertisers and advertising agencies will all be invited to give their views, and the government hopes the exercise will force them to be more restrained. The government is also putting together a report on the portrayal of women in advertising. The report, to be published in July, will name and shame advertisers that use sexist images to incite violence against women, and could lead to new government controls on the industry. The recent backlash against the pervasiveness of sex in French advertising has been led by a feminist group calling itself \"Chiennes de Garde\", or \"guard bitches\", which has campaigned for a boycott of products that are promoted in this way. The Sophie Dahl poster for Opium perfume, which was the most complained-about advert in the UK, has come under fire from the group as has a poster campaign for the fashion retailer, The City, which showed a nearly nude woman kneeling next to a sheep above the line, \"I need a sweater\". That campaign was recently banned by the French advertising watchdog.",

The bed looks like a scene from The Godfather and I look and move like Frankenstein's monster. My legs shake and ache. My head is light. I have the distinct impression that my intestines and colon are going to fall out of my vagina. But, fortunately, I am still euphoric at having produced an actual baby. I daren't sit down in the bath and I watch in dismay as a lot of blood goes everywhere. The nurse rubs me down like I'm a horse, and gives me a pad that would be adequate for one. She also gives me a pair of paper knickers. They have small pink sprigs on them, a nice touch. </p> <p><strong> Day one </strong><br> </p> <p> I have to recline, since sitting feels life-threateningly painful. I refuse to look down there and also refuse to let my husband look as I don't want him to retain this image. He thinks I'm mad, as he saw the baby come out. My stomach is still inflated. My shoulders, oddly, ache as if I've carried a piano around for several days. My breasts are producing weird pale liquid called colostrum, that my baby laps up round the clock but other than this they don't feel any different. I have been given \"stool softener\" pills but apparently may not be able to \"go\" for quite some time. </p> <p><strong> Day two </strong><br> </p> <p> I am still having painful \"contractions\". This is my womb shrinking and shouldn't persist. Walking out of the hospital is a challenge. I have to stick my bum out and take tiny steps like an ancient tribal dancer. I am dismayed that I look heavily pregnant. I am unable to sit down in the car and have to perch, one cheek on the side of the seat, swearing. </p> <p><strong> Day three </strong><br> </p> <p> I now see the need for stool softener and can confirm that it has failed. I am genuinely alarmed by my piles. Can still barely move, let alone sit down. My boobs have inflated to the size and texture of medicine balls; my nipples are bright red and sore. Exhaustion. I keep crying. The pregnancy book explains that this is a normal hormonal day-three thing - my oestrogen and progesterone levels have \"dropped precipitously\". I cannot see an evolutionary need for this. The authors suggests my husband gets us a nice takeaway. Lots of blood. Oh, and I'm incontinent and fat. Apart from that, motherhood is a breeze. </p> <p><strong> Day four </strong><br> </p> <p> My husband finally insists on taking a look at my parts. I am sure he'll never want me again, but right now couldn't care less. He claims - to my astonishment - that they look almost normal. I know he is lying because when I move I can feel the wind whistling up there and things flapping. Also, the midwife told me she put in purple stitches. Love is a wonderful thing. </p> <p> <strong> Week two </strong><br> </p> <p> Still incontinent. Still fat. Breastfeeding is hell. My baby eats at least once an hour (what happened to \"four-hourly schedules\"?) My nipples are cracked. I am variously engorged and completely milk-free. And I now have a suspicious red, painful lump on one breast. The midwife says it's a \"blocked duct\" and I should massage it and steam it. A day later, the whole side of the boob is red and enflamed and feels like someone is sticking hot knives into it. I have a fever. Midwife diagnoses mastitis - an infection of the milk ducts - and prescribes rest (ha), steaming them over a pan of hot water, massage and antibiotics. </p> <p><strong> Week three </strong><br> </p> <p> The mastitis takes three days of agony and gradually dissipating fever and four more of low-grade pain to disperse. And I have to keep breastfeeding through the pain. I can now walk, but after any time on my feet I feel, again, that someone has battered my perineum with a hard object. </p> <p><strong> Week six </strong><br> </p> <p> My book talks about \"easing back into sex\". One of the tips is \"don't be discouraged by pain\". Hello? My hair is falling out and I am two stone overweight. My stretch marks are angry red and my belly looks like a crumpled, partially deflated balloon. I tried to do some pelvic floor exercises but was unable to locate a single responsive muscle. I have also just noticed another red lump on the same breast. Sexy? </p> <p><strong> Week seven </strong><br> </p> <p> Another week, another bout of mastitis, course of antibiotics. Fretful baby. I have been told that his elephantine wind problem could be a result of dairy produce in my diet and so have cut it out. He is still farting and writhing. I have had no sleep and am depressed. My health visitor gives me a questionnaire to check whether I have post-natal depression. Apparently not.

I must tell you that no such undertaking has been received, and so here they are.</p> <p>On April 12, Mr Lock told Steve, who'd repeated a Private Eye story about his abandoning the campaign to save Kidderminster hospital on joining the lord chancellor's office (he is junior minister in charge of knee breeches): \"I am going to bankrupt you and your colleagues... I will take out an injunction and see you never print again... You're in more hot water than you can possibly imagine and will be lucky to survive... Your magazine is far more influential than Private Eye.\"</p> <p>Also intriguing is the threat in a later legal letter of a criminal prosecution under section 106 of the Representation of the People Act. Since this only applies once an election has been called, this suggests either harassment and abuse of the law, or a justice minister oddly ignorant of the law. Or both. Derry Irvine may wish to investigate.</p> <p>\u0095 Worrying news from the world of e-commerce where Yava.com, the venture of my old friend David Montgomery, looks in trouble. The former Mirror Group boss set it up to provide an online tabloid for distribution solely to pubs - a brilliant idea even by the standards of internet start ups. Inexplicably, there are teething troubles, and both David's partners, ex-Sunday Mirror editor Bridget Rowe and onetime Mirror boss David Banks, have left hurriedly.</p> <p>According to the receptionist, neither is expected back, and even Monty himself is hard to pin down. Details are sketchy, so we will as usual leave the business of unravelling the full story to proper journalists.</p> <p>\u0095 Surveillance (1): IPPR think tank chief Matthew Taylor on Tuesday's Newsnight, inexplicably lying on a sofa in a central London square to discuss anti-corporatism in Britain. Matthew made a surprisingly convincing neutral, given that the IPPR enjoys substantial funding from companies such as Cisco Systems, ICL and KPMG.</p> <p>Meanwhile, we gather this ultra-Blairite thinker has been lined up as a Newsnight election pundit - another wearying appointment given that he's one of Mr Tony's most sycophantic cronies, widely tipped to join the Number 10 policy unit after the election.</p> <p>\u0095 Surveillance (2): on the same programme, anarchist supremo Chris Nineham, wiping the floor with the quite breathtakingly egregious Tory MP Oliver Letwin. Some of the chaps have been wondering what happened to Chris since school, where he was one of our top scholars; so good to see him on such form. Matthew Byam-Shaw sends his regards, Chris, as do I.</p> <p>\u0095 Following technical analyses proving Robin Cook has lowered his voice, rumour arrives that he is now modelling his delivery on Miss Jean Brodie. My colleague Marina Hyde rings Karl Hill at ICM, Maggie Smith's agency, requesting confirmation that she has been giving Cookie elocution lessons. \"Er... not to our knowledge,\" says Karl. \"And it's likely we'd know.\" Should we try Geraldine McEwan who played Miss Jean on telly then? \"Er, maybe...\" Click brrr.</p> <p>\u0095 Nike Lapite calls from the Institute of Sales and Marketing Management. \"Would you be interested in the hottest sales date in the calendar?\" she asks. Well, not real... \"Neil Rackham, the big-shot US motivator, is coming to the UK to address salesmen and people like yourselves.\" Like us? \"The angle for you guys is, we're entering a recession and companies are neglecting their best asset - the sales force.\" Aha. \"The whole tone is very go, go, go, and I just thought it was a punchy enough one for the Diary.\" Nike, have you ever seen the Diary? \"Er... no. But take my number and call if you need more info.\" Thanking you.</p>",

On April 12, Mr Lock told Steve, who'd repeated a Private Eye story about his abandoning the campaign to save Kidderminster hospital on joining the lord chancellor's office (he is junior minister in charge of knee breeches): \"I am going to bankrupt you and your colleagues... I will take out an injunction and see you never print again... You're in more hot water than you can possibly imagine and will be lucky to survive... Your magazine is far more influential than Private Eye.\" Also intriguing is the threat in a later legal letter of a criminal prosecution under section 106 of the Representation of the People Act. Since this only applies once an election has been called, this suggests either harassment and abuse of the law, or a justice minister oddly ignorant of the law. Or both. Derry Irvine may wish to investigate. \u0095 Worrying news from the world of e-commerce where Yava.com, the venture of my old friend David Montgomery, looks in trouble. The former Mirror Group boss set it up to provide an online tabloid for distribution solely to pubs - a brilliant idea even by the standards of internet start ups. Inexplicably, there are teething troubles, and both David's partners, ex-Sunday Mirror editor Bridget Rowe and onetime Mirror boss David Banks, have left hurriedly. According to the receptionist, neither is expected back, and even Monty himself is hard to pin down. Details are sketchy, so we will as usual leave the business of unravelling the full story to proper journalists. \u0095 Surveillance (1): IPPR think tank chief Matthew Taylor on Tuesday's Newsnight, inexplicably lying on a sofa in a central London square to discuss anti-corporatism in Britain. Matthew made a surprisingly convincing neutral, given that the IPPR enjoys substantial funding from companies such as Cisco Systems, ICL and KPMG. Meanwhile, we gather this ultra-Blairite thinker has been lined up as a Newsnight election pundit - another wearying appointment given that he's one of Mr Tony's most sycophantic cronies, widely tipped to join the Number 10 policy unit after the election. \u0095 Surveillance (2): on the same programme, anarchist supremo Chris Nineham, wiping the floor with the quite breathtakingly egregious Tory MP Oliver Letwin. Some of the chaps have been wondering what happened to Chris since school, where he was one of our top scholars; so good to see him on such form. Matthew Byam-Shaw sends his regards, Chris, as do I. \u0095 Following technical analyses proving Robin Cook has lowered his voice, rumour arrives that he is now modelling his delivery on Miss Jean Brodie. My colleague Marina Hyde rings Karl Hill at ICM, Maggie Smith's agency, requesting confirmation that she has been giving Cookie elocution lessons. \"Er... not to our knowledge,\" says Karl. \"And it's likely we'd know.\" Should we try Geraldine McEwan who played Miss Jean on telly then? \"Er, maybe...\" Click brrr. \u0095 Nike Lapite calls from the Institute of Sales and Marketing Management. \"Would you be interested in the hottest sales date in the calendar?\" she asks. Well, not real... \"Neil Rackham, the big-shot US motivator, is coming to the UK to address salesmen and people like yourselves.\" Like us? \"The angle for you guys is, we're entering a recession and companies are neglecting their best asset - the sales force.\" Aha. \"The whole tone is very go, go, go, and I just thought it was a punchy enough one for the Diary.\" Nike, have you ever seen the Diary? \"Er... no. But take my number and call if you need more info.\" Thanking you.",

The defence secretary Geoff Hoon insisted last night that, despite Conservative efforts to force the issue, Britain did not yet need to make a decision since the Bush administration had not set out the form of defence shield they favoured. However he added: \"If there is a threat that we would have to deal with - either to the UK or to our deployed forces, and that could be made to work - then yes that would be a good idea.\" Earlier, the Tory leadership had sensed a pre-election opportunity to draw blood by seizing upon a careless phrase by the prime minister's spokesman, Alastair Campbell, shortly after his boss had crossed swords at question time with William Hague. The row flared 24 hours after Mr Bush had confirmed that the US believed that the post-cold war threat from so-called \"rogue\" states had rendered obsolete the 1972 anti-ballistic missile treaty, which severely restricted anti-missile deployments. Pushed during exchanges with the Tory leader in the Commons, Mr Blair said that he would await \"a firm proposal before giving a firm decision\". But 20 minutes later Mr Campbell was asked during a routine press briefing with reporters whether Mr Blair, who has been cautious on the delicate issue of national missile defence (NMD), thought it was a good idea. Mr Campbell replied: \"Broadly, yes, in that the Americans are the last remaining superpower.\" Although Mr Campbell tried to qualify his remark, it was enough to make the Tory defence spokesman, Iain Duncan Smith, claim that the prime minister's spokesman was spilling the beans on No 10's inner thoughts. Officials later dismissed the claim. During possibly the last prime minister's question time before the election, Mr Hague had quoted senior Labour backbenchers, some of whom want an early UK commitment to modernise British radars that will be needed for the NMD network of anti-missile missiles. He demanded from Mr Blair the \"the clearest possible public statement of principle\" that NMD - if technically feasible -would be in Britain's interests too. The Tory leader has already made that commitment himself, in contrast to scepticism from the EU, China and Russia. In a foretaste of the coming election campaign, Mr Duncan Smith continued the Tory attack, protesting on Radio 4's PM programme that it was \"outrageous\" that the apparent change of policy had been announced to journalists rather than by Mr Blair to the Commons.

The boost for Balfour Beatty, which yesterday announced profits of \u00a3114m, came on the day its chief executive, Mike Welton, conceded at its annual meeting that the firm could have ordered speed restrictions or the closure of the Hatfield linewhen it found defects before the crash - in which four people died - but decided not to do so. The announcement, ahead of next month's high court challenge to the public-private partnership, was made as the Rail, Maritime and Transport union called off today's planned tube strike over jobs and safety, following an appeal by the TUC leader John Monks and criticism from Tony Blair. The union, which has won concessions in its dispute with Underground managers over the impact of the sell-off plans, suspended their walkout for two weeks after coming under intense pressure, but decided to go ahead with a strike today on South West Trains. Yesterday's announcement of preferred bidders for the tube, regarded as an attempt by John Prescott to strengthen the government's hand in court, met with fury from London's mayor, Ken Livingstone, who described it as a \"stab in the back for London\" and warned it would become \"a massive election issue\" in the capital. \"The government is bringing in the system, and in some cases the firms, responsible for the debacle on the national rail network which led to tragedies like Hatfield,\" he said.

      "bodyText": "A Daily Telegraph-reading accountant yesterday claimed he was preparing for a fancy dress party when he was arrested at the May Day anti-capitalist protests in London. Nigel Lovell pleaded not guilty before Bow Street magistrates to failing to remove a scarf from his face when police told him to do so. He said: \"It's ridiculous. I was going to a fancy dress party dressed as General Custer and was on Bond Street on my way to Hamley's to buy a toy gun. \"I had nothing to do with the protest. I was wearing a scarf as part of my costume and I didn't refuse to remove it, I just asked whether I would get it back.\" Lovell, who was bailed to reappear in June, was the first of 13 people to appear in court yesterday following the demonstrations on Tuesday. Faure Perez, 21, of Forest Hill, south-east London, was fined \u00a3100 with \u00a350 costs for failing to remove a cyclist's mask when challenged as he protested in Trafalgar Square. The police can demand that people remove masks under the Public Order Act. Brian Kennedy, defending, said: \"He asked for proof that the provision existed and was not given any... There were photographers around and if there was trouble he didn't want to be pictured in the papers because people might think he had caused the trouble.\" But magistrate Christopher Pratt said: \"You were wearing the mask to conceal your identity and that's the reason why police wanted you to remove the mask.\" Nicholas Gray, 32, of Southwark, south-east London, was remanded on bail to June 20 after pleading not guilty to failing to remove his cap and sunglasses. Peter Zephar, 28, of Shepherd's Bush, west London, and Godson Chigbu, 33, of Lambeth, south London, were both remanded on bail to June 19 after they denied assaulting police officers. Chigbu shouted: \"Power to the people\" as he left the court. Ryan Fowler, 23, of Colehill, Dorset, pleaded not guilty to assault and was remanded on bail to appear on June 21. Two men pleaded guilty to being drunk and disorderly. Bruce Jonathan Guy Lisle-Fennick, of no fixed address, was fined \u00a340 after the court heard that he had shouted obscenities at police and struggled when officers tried to arrest him. He was remanded in custody when the court heard arrest warrants for him had been issued in Wales and Warwickshire on unrelated offences. Michael Mower, 32, of Ely, Cambridgeshire, was fined \u00a340 for being \"loud and aggressive\" and \u00a350 for possessing cannabis resin. He already owes \u00a3400 in fines. Three others were charged with possessing cannabis. Mark Covell, 33, of Ladbroke Grove, west London, will be cautioned at his local police station, while Claire Woolstone, 21, from Sydenham, south London, pleaded not guilty and opted for a crown court trial. Pascal Hasselle, 36, a Belgian, was given a conditional discharge after magistrates heard that he had spent the night in custody and planned to return to Brussels last night. Two men were remanded on bail after pleading not guilty to carrying knives. David Randall, 32, of Glastonbury, Somerset, opted for a crown court trial while US citizen Adam Volk, who lives in Brighton, will appear before magistrates on May 4.

The tactic used by officers, which was seen as keeping the violence and damage from this year's protests at a far lower level than last year, saw demonstrators encircled by lines of riot police. They were released slowly with many being searched or photographed after being held until well into the evening.</p> <p>The Met said that detaining large numbers of people on Tuesday as they did on several occasions was lawful under common law as they feared a breach of the peace \"based on the behaviour demonstrated combined with intelligence\".</p> <p>A spokesman said officers had \"tried to identify those not protesting and tried to allow them out\". He added: \"The officers had reasonable grounds that the public would be subjected to violence and that there would be widespread damage to property if this action was not taken.\"</p> <p>But John Wadham, director of the civil rights group Liberty, said this tactic could be unlawful on several grounds. He said the police could not lawfully detain people without arresting them, which they had not done. The Home Office rejected this point.</p> <p>Mr Wadham said that the police had taken a \"blanket approach\" and detained everyone in the Oxford Circus area.</p> <p>He said: \"What happened on May Day was unlawful. Individuals should be free from arrest and detention unless the police have clear powers and exercise these in a justifiable way, and they didn't.\"</p> <p>The police justified searching some of those they had detained saying they had the power under section 60 of the 1994 Criminal Justice Act.</p> <p>But Mr Wadham said Liberty had helped the Met carry out an audit of the powers to see whether it was compatible with the Human Rights Act and had found that section 60 was not.</p> <p>Barrister Richard Clayton said: \"If they detained everyone in Oxford Circus at the time, that's unlawful. They have to differentiate between the individuals they detain. The difficulty people who sue will face, although the police are probably acting at the edge of their legal powers, [is that] it will be said that the police should be given a degree of latitude as they were facing a difficult public order situation.\"</p> <p>One of those encircled by police at Oxford Circus said she and up to 300 people wanted to take a collective legal action against the police. Lois Austin, 32, said she was held from 2pm to 9.30pm and had been supposed to collect her 11-month-old daughter from nursery at 5.30pm. When she asked to leave, she claimed a sergeant told her: \"You should have thought of that before you came.\"</p> <p>One of those detained was an actress who played a police chief in a BBC series. Anna Cartaret, star of Juliet Bravo, was held for five-and-a-half hours and only let out when an officer recognised her: \"People began to get irritable because they couldn't eat, couldn't go to the loo, they weren't told why they were being kept penned up,\" she said.</p> <p>Tony Blair yesterday telephoned the Met commissioner, Sir John Stevens, to congratulate him and his officers. \"The prime minister said it had been a very big challenge for the police and that the Met had passed it magnificently and every one of his officers could be very proud of themselves,\" said a spokesman.</p> <p>The Met won praise from the home secretary and from the London mayor, Ken Livingstone. Scotland Yard said they had made 92 arrests, with 32 people charged.</p> <p>Twenty-three people had minor injuries and three officers were hurt.</p> <p>Yesterday morning Oxford Street was getting back to normal. The most severe damage was on Tottenham Court road, where several banks had their windows smashed, as did camera shops and a futon store.</p> <p><b>The London May Day protests at a glance</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/story/0,7369,481318,00.html\">Minute-by-minute coverage of the demonstrations</a></p> <p><b>Audio reports</b><br><a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/audio2001/0501vidal.ra\">John Vidal witnesses a party atmosphere outside McDonald's in King's Cross, London (1min 45)</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.pixunlimited.co.uk:7080/ramgen/news/audio2001/0501left.ra\">Sarah Left on the Critical Mass cycle ride (2mins)</a></p> <p><b>Caption competition</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/graphic/0,7367,481420,00.html\">Send us a caption for this May Day picture and win a prize</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/comment/story/0,3604,482145,00.html\">02.05.2001, comment: May Day lessons for the rootless</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mayday/story/0,7369,482007,00.html\">02.05.2001: We're not revolting, but do we protest too much?</a><br><a href=\"http://www.guardianunlimited.co.uk/mayday/story/0,7369,481858,00.html\">02.05.2001: May Day clear-up begins</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/story/0,7369,481753,00.html\">02.05.2001: Police trap for protesters</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/story/0,7369,481728,00.html\">02.05.2001, comment: Why I was there</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/story/0,7369,481751,00.html\">02.05.2001: A day of skirmishes then stalemate</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/story/0,7369,481626,00.html\">02.05.2001, leader: Taking to the streets</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/story/0,7369,481660,00.html\">02.05.2001, analysis: Global's good side</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/story/0,7369,481739,00.html\">02.05.2001, comment: In place of violence</a><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/story/0,7369,481481,00.html \">01.05.2001: May Day could cost millions</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/story/0,7369,481319,00.html\">01.05.2001: May Day protests grip London</a><br><a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/story/0,7369,481407,00.html\">01.05.2001: May Day mood begins to darken</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/story/0,7369,480988,00.html\">01.05.2001, comment: Politics not parliament</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/story/0,7369,481222,00.html\">01.05.2001: Blair attacks 'spurious' May Day protest</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/story/0,7369,481125,00.html\">01.05.2001: Confusion reigns as police brace for mayhem</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/story/0,7369,481096,00.html\">01.05.2001, comment: Violence is our enemy</a></p> <p><b>Photo galleries</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/gall/0,8542,481316,00.html\">Pictures of today's protests in London</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/gall/0,8542,481339,00.html\">Pictures of today's protests around the world</a></p> <p><b>Interactive guide</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/flash/0,7365,477858,00.html \">Interactive guide to global protests </a><br></p> <p><b>Maps</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/graphic/0,7367,480993,00.html\">What's happened so far</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/graphic/0,7367,481480,00.html\">What's going on in Oxford Street</a></p> <p><b>How the Guardian is covering May Day</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/story/0,7369,481267,00.html\">01.05.2001: Keeping a level head</a></p> <p><b>Weblog special</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/weblogindex2/0,6799,475360,00.html\">May Day 2001</a></p> <p><b>The issue explained </b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/story/0,7369,481489,00.html\">History of anti-capitalism protests</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theissues/article/0,6512,479726,00.html\">The May Day protests</a></p> <p><b>Talk about it</b><br> <a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee81d50/0\">What do you think?</a></p> <p><b>Special reports</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/mayday/\">May Day 2001 </a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/globalisation/ \">Globalisation </a></p> <p><b>Net notes</b><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/netnotes/article/0,6729,214862,00.html \">May Day protests -

But Mr Wadham said Liberty had helped the Met carry out an audit of the powers to see whether it was compatible with the Human Rights Act and had found that section 60 was not. Barrister Richard Clayton said: \"If they detained everyone in Oxford Circus at the time, that's unlawful. They have to differentiate between the individuals they detain. The difficulty people who sue will face, although the police are probably acting at the edge of their legal powers, [is that] it will be said that the police should be given a degree of latitude as they were facing a difficult public order situation.\" One of those encircled by police at Oxford Circus said she and up to 300 people wanted to take a collective legal action against the police. Lois Austin, 32, said she was held from 2pm to 9.30pm and had been supposed to collect her 11-month-old daughter from nursery at 5.30pm. When she asked to leave, she claimed a sergeant told her: \"You should have thought of that before you came.\" One of those detained was an actress who played a police chief in a BBC series. Anna Cartaret, star of Juliet Bravo, was held for five-and-a-half hours and only let out when an officer recognised her: \"People began to get irritable because they couldn't eat, couldn't go to the loo, they weren't told why they were being kept penned up,\" she said. Tony Blair yesterday telephoned the Met commissioner, Sir John Stevens, to congratulate him and his officers. \"The prime minister said it had been a very big challenge for the police and that the Met had passed it magnificently and every one of his officers could be very proud of themselves,\" said a spokesman. The Met won praise from the home secretary and from the London mayor, Ken Livingstone. Scotland Yard said they had made 92 arrests, with 32 people charged. Twenty-three people had minor injuries and three officers were hurt. Yesterday morning Oxford Street was getting back to normal. The most severe damage was on Tottenham Court road, where several banks had their windows smashed, as did camera shops and a futon store.

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair will announce that the country is on the home stretch in the battle over foot and mouth when he holds his first press conference on the crisis today - the day he had originally set aside for the general election. He will set out figures showing that the army and vets are getting control of the crisis, paving the way for the election on June 7 which will probably be announced next Tuesday. With his opinion poll standing unshaken, Mr Blair's decision to delay the ballot from the original May 3 date is now likely to be seen as justified. Mr Blair will be flanked by the chief vet, Jim Scudamore, and the government chief scientist, David King. Figures coming into the Ministry of Agriculture show the government is finally reducing the backlog of unburied animals. Mr Blair will also confirm that the number of new cases has fallen to 7-10 a day, from the average of 16 in the seven days before April 22. He will reveal that in every region of the country the vets and army are reaching their target of slaughter within 24 hours of detection. As recently as a week ago the figure was less than 50% . He is expected to report that fewer than 90,000 of the 2.5m slaughtered animals still remain to be disposed of. Mr Blair will also report there are only 118,000 animals waiting to be slaughtered. The number disposed of daily had reached 51,000 in the week ending April 22, up from 28,000 in the week ending March 25. More areas are being declared foot and mouth free. However, Mr Blair's problems are not yet over. The National Farmers Union is threatening to take the government to court over recent cuts in compensation for slaughtered animals. The English tourist industry is furious that it is not receiving extra cash to promote the tourist industry at home. Ministers announced yesterday only extra cash to promote England abroad. At today's press conference Mr Blair will counsel caution, pointing out that the previous foot and mouth outbreak had a long tail and continued vigilance is required. He will also face questions about the future direction of farming. The agriculture minister, Nick Brown, has indicated that he would like to see farming move towards a subsidy system based on acreage rather than numbers of livestock. Change has already occurred with the hill farmers' allowance, but he would like to see the same change implemented for the sheep annual premium scheme. The government is also likely to increase the amount of cash it spends on environmental farming. Further change awaits a meeting of EU agriculture ministers in the autumn at which Mr Brown will use his new alliance with the German Green agriculture minister to push for further changes to the CAP.

The money will be used over the next two years to provide single rooms giving more privacy to families, home comforts such as television and telephones, and rooms for fathers to stay when their babies need special care.</p> <p>Mr Milburn said a new national service framework for children and maternity services would set a \"gold standard\" of providing a dedicated midwife for each woman in labour for 100% of the time. Under the present system, only 70% of maternity units are able to provide this level of continuous support for women. Recruitment incentives would include \u00a31,500 for former midwives returning to the profession and assistance with childcare costs worth up to \u00a3150 a week.</p> <p>Mr Milburn said the framework would end the \"lottery of childbirth choices\" for women in England.\"Those parts of the country with the greatest need and the biggest shortages will benefit from the biggest expansion in midwife numbers,\" he told the Royal College of Midwives' annual conference in Torquay.</p> <p>Belinda Phipps, chief executive of the National Childbirth Trust, said two-thirds of women were left without professional support at some time during labour and a quarter were worried when left alone.</p> <p>Liam Fox, the shadow health secretary, called the announcement a smokescreen. \"The Department of Health's own figures show that the drop in the number of midwives since 1997 has been 390. The number of midwifery posts vacant for more than three months has risen by a third over the last year from 370 to 490. So where does the secretary of state think he can find an extra 2,000?\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Every woman will have continuous one to one care from a midwife during labour under plans for a rapid expansion of maternity services announced yesterday by Alan Milburn, the health secretary. He promised to recruit 500 extra midwives in England this year and a further 1,500 by 2005 to relieve staff shortages that have resulted in too many women being left alone during labour, or receiving care from staff they did not know. All 250 NHS maternity units in England will share in a \u00a3100m modernisation fund. The money will be used over the next two years to provide single rooms giving more privacy to families, home comforts such as television and telephones, and rooms for fathers to stay when their babies need special care. Mr Milburn said a new national service framework for children and maternity services would set a \"gold standard\" of providing a dedicated midwife for each woman in labour for 100% of the time. Under the present system, only 70% of maternity units are able to provide this level of continuous support for women. Recruitment incentives would include \u00a31,500 for former midwives returning to the profession and assistance with childcare costs worth up to \u00a3150 a week. Mr Milburn said the framework would end the \"lottery of childbirth choices\" for women in England.\"Those parts of the country with the greatest need and the biggest shortages will benefit from the biggest expansion in midwife numbers,\" he told the Royal College of Midwives' annual conference in Torquay. Belinda Phipps, chief executive of the National Childbirth Trust, said two-thirds of women were left without professional support at some time during labour and a quarter were worried when left alone. Liam Fox, the shadow health secretary, called the announcement a smokescreen. \"The Department of Health's own figures show that the drop in the number of midwives since 1997 has been 390. The number of midwifery posts vacant for more than three months has risen by a third over the last year from 370 to 490. So where does the secretary of state think he can find an extra 2,000?\"",

And that curious outcome led to another - inter-candidate solidarity survived the last 12 months as mayor Livingstone copied Tony Blair's \"big tent\" politics and brought his defeated rivals into office with him. In his post-election speech Mr Livingstone offered jobs in his administration to defeated candidates from all three main parties. Today, four of the top eight candidates - Mr Livingstone, the Tory Steve Norris, Lib Dem Susan Kramer and the Green, Darren Johnson - play some part in governing London. All this is thanks to the anti-party dynamic of the mayoral campaign. Norris, with his bluff pro-gay, pro-hanging, anti-abortion policy slate and anarchic sense of humour, was hardly a typical Tory just as Dobson, equally funny, even more foul mouthed and sceptical of New Labour, was no Millbank clone. Even Ms Kramer, an ambitious transport specialist married to an American banker, came from outside her party's traditional roots. And three other candidates stood out, too. As well as Livingstone - whose status outside the big three parties was perhaps only nominal - the mayoral election brought into the limelight Darren Johnson, the Green candidate who campaigned from a bike. He was beaten by an even more unexpected figure, Ram Gidoomal of the Christian People's Alliance, who gained 2.4% and plenty of respect, particularly from traditionalist Conservatives put off by Steve Norris' liberated attitude to sex. Within weeks of the election, Ms Kramer, had accepted a post on the board of Transport for London, the body responsible for sorting out the tube. Instead of seeking a seat in parliament - as was widely expected - she focussed her political energies on London and has, so far, worked closely with the mayor. Her media presence has been at least as high as Mr Livingstone's nominal deputy, Labour's Nicky Gavron. So has that of Steve Norris - once, as a Tory MP, a tabloid favourite for his sexual antics. He is now a vice chairman of the Conservative party and as such part of William Hague's campaign team for the general election. However he also sits on the board of Transport for London and admits he finds the mayor an \"engaging person privately who it is very easy to like\" - although he opposes the mayor's plans to charge drivers entering central London.

Peter Tatchell, the gay rights activist, has continued his campaigning - most recently clashing with Zimbabwe's president Robert Mugabe in Belgium.

      "bodyText": "A Russian journalist who was captured by the military while reporting from behind Chechen lines has warned that restrictions on press freedom in Russia are reverting to cold war levels. Anna Politkovskaya, who works for the Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta, said it was \"very important\" for journalists in Britain and the west to show their solidarity with journalists in Russia and put pressure on the government. She warned that pressures on journalists operating within the Russian federation were reverting to levels last experienced during the cold war. After going behind rebel lines in Chechnya, Ms Politkovskaya was captured by the Russian army, who tortured her and subjected her to a series of harrowing intimidations. Her captors told her it was \"time to pay\" for her reports on Chechnya. Ms Politkovskaya said when she was released and returned home to in Moscow, she turned on the television to see a newsreader denouncing her as \"an enemy of the country\". \"It's horrific to hear these things and to hear them reverting to the terminology of the 70s,\" she said. Ms Politkovskaya, who is to meet the prime minister, Tony Blair, later this week, said she wanted to ask him why he was the \"number one friend\" of the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, who has been responsible for clampdowns on the media. \"Whether this question of extinguishing freedom of speech has ever been discussed between Mr Blair and Mr Putin, I would like to know,\" she said, adding: \"If Blair is a democrat, how can he not discuss it?\" The war between the Russian federation and Chechen rebels has already claimed several journalist victims. Last weekend French journalist Brice Fleutiaux, who was captured by Chechen rebels, committed suicide.

The news comes as more and more companies are using mobile phones to contact consumers - Big Brother supremo Peter Bazalgette revealed he is to launch a text message service for its new series. Mobile phone marketing company The Mobile Channel sent text message adverts to 1,000 people aged 16-30 who had detailed their interests to make sure the adverts were relevant to them. The results reveal that 94% of the users were satisfied with the service and 85% of them would recommend it to a friend. According to the survey more than seven out of 10 of participants read between 75% and all of their text message adverts and 81% agreed the adverts were interesting or appropriate. But the news that the text adverts typically received response rates of between 10% and 20% with the highest achieving 28% will be the most important factor to brands considering advertising over mobile phones. It means that consumers are very willing to interact with brands who text them. In comparison, a successful direct mail campaign can expect to elicit a 3% response rate. Thirty-five brands have taken part in a text message advertising trial which has produced customer response rates of up to 28%. Brands including Cadbury's, Carlsberg, Sega, GlaxoSmithKline, Blockbuster, Camelot, Tango and Thomas Cook took part in the six week trial conducted by NOP and on behalf of The Mobile Channel. The trial was carried out in conjunction with the London Business School, was endorsed by The Incorporated Society of British Advertisers and sponsored by media buying company MediaCom. Mediacom head of account research Andy Richmond says: \"The Mobile Channel's model will allow us insights into what it takes to establish a one to one relationship with the consumer, which is every advertiser's ultimate aim.\" Carlsberg-Tetley brand manager Simon Pick says: \"Mobile has the potential to allow us to communicate in a timely manner with our target market when and where it is most appropriate - for example when they are out drinking, or immediately following one of the sports events we are part of.\" Related stories 22.03.2001: UK firm trials text message advertising 19.03.2001: Hard sell in your hand",

      "bodyText": "Yahoo! is bracing itself for a spat after instigating a pornography crackdown on its website. Sections of Yahoo!'s online community have grouped together to prepare petitions fighting for the survival of their online clubs, message boards and chatrooms. They say that the company's extended ban on the sale of porn is tantamount to a complete purge and censorship. The revolt comes less than a month after Yahoo! said it was banning the sale of pornography on its shopping section because public opinion was mounting against it. Over the past few weeks, Yahoo! has quietly reconfigured its adult-themed online clubs, message boards and chat rooms, removing links and making them harder to find. Many users say they feel betrayed, and fear the clubs will fail to attract new members and ultimately disappear altogether. The issue underscores the popularity of the porn on the internet. Ken Bradman, a 23-year-old web developer who has organised a protest club, said: \"If they completely eliminate adult material from the site, they're going to lose a lot of members. I can guarantee you it's going to be a huge chunk of Yahoo's user base.\" Some also say Yahoo's action actually makes it easier for children to see adult content. Yahoo spokesman Jackson Holtz confirmed the company has made several changes as \"part of the evaluation of adult content across the network\" . But he said no decisions have been made on whether the changes will be permanent. \"It's the internet, so lots of things are possible,\" he said. The porn issue blew up in March following press reports criticising Yahoo! of profiting from the sale of hardcore videos and DVDs. Yahoo had sold X-rated products for two years and had planned to expand this before it quickly back-peddled after a media frenzy.

The Kurds should make representations to the Turkish government which proposed it and the British government, which had been asked to provide a \u00a3200m export credit guarantee to back the project. </p> <p>Balfour Beatty objected to a proposal by Friends of the Earth, which has bought a \u00a320,000 stake in the company, to adopt a World Commission on Dams report this year that required contractors to consider human rights and environmental issues when deciding to build dams. </p> <p>Charles Secrett, director, of FoE, said not adopting the commission's principles damaged the company's reputation and was bad for long term business. </p> <p>Lord Weir said he did not feel the \"distance between us and Friends of the Earth is very great\" but said the commission's 26 principles on dam construction were \"issues for the people that propose dams, not the companies that build them\". But he said the company had adopted an ethical policy that included respect for the universal declaration of human rights. </p> <p>Asked whether he regretted getting involved in the decision to build the dam, Lord Weir said \"If we had known then how controversial this project would be we could have saved ourselves a lot of trouble by not taking part in it, but this was not the case at the time.\"</p>",

Diyardi Kurdi, who had bought shares in the company to attend, said the guerrilla group's two-year ceasefire would end if the company went ahead with the plan. \"I have lost 24 close relatives and my house has been destroyed but we will not give up the fight.\" Kurdish opposition to the dam for which Balfour Beatty is lead contractor was voiced by several shareholders who demanded the company withdraw rather than flood the city of Hasankeyf and the homes of 72,000 people. Lord Weir said it was not his company's decision to build the dam. The Kurds should make representations to the Turkish government which proposed it and the British government, which had been asked to provide a \u00a3200m export credit guarantee to back the project. Balfour Beatty objected to a proposal by Friends of the Earth, which has bought a \u00a320,000 stake in the company, to adopt a World Commission on Dams report this year that required contractors to consider human rights and environmental issues when deciding to build dams. Charles Secrett, director, of FoE, said not adopting the commission's principles damaged the company's reputation and was bad for long term business. Lord Weir said he did not feel the \"distance between us and Friends of the Earth is very great\" but said the commission's 26 principles on dam construction were \"issues for the people that propose dams, not the companies that build them\". But he said the company had adopted an ethical policy that included respect for the universal declaration of human rights. Asked whether he regretted getting involved in the decision to build the dam, Lord Weir said \"If we had known then how controversial this project would be we could have saved ourselves a lot of trouble by not taking part in it, but this was not the case at the time.\"",

      "body": "<p>The US government yesterday indicted Sir Anthony Tennant, a pillar of the British business establishment, and Alfred Taubman, the US shopping mall tycoon, for masterminding an alleged price-fixing scandal at the world's leading art auction houses.</p> <p>Sir Anthony, best known as the man called in to restore the reputation of Guinness after the 1980s share scandal, and the former chairman of Christie's, and Mr Taubman, the owner and former chairman of Sotheby's, face up to three years in prison if they are found guilty of colluding to fix commission charges - but Sir Anthony immediately made it clear he would refuse to answer the charges.</p> <p>Yesterday's criminal charges follow a four-year investigation into the \u00a32.5bn a year art auction market which has thrown the rarefied and exclusive world into turmoil.</p> <p>The scandal - which has already led to a $512m (\u00a3360m) fine for the two auction houses - now threatens to drag both septuagenarians into a courtroom after impressive careers on either side of the Atlantic. The bulk of the evidence against them - said to include memos and other documents - has been provided by their previous underlings, who insist that they are not prepared to take any blame.</p> <p>The two auction houses, which control more than 90% of the world's live auctions of art works, jewellery and furniture, are said to have conspired to fix prices for a period of six years, and the US department of justice claims the arrangement was thrashed out in private meetings between Mr Taubman and Sir Anthony. The former Christie's chairman admits the two men held meetings, but insists they were \"innocent\" and that there was no collusion to rip off the auction houses' wealthy clients.</p> <p>The justice department said the two undercut each other's offers to sellers, costing sellers their principal bargaining tool. It calculates that the agreement cost US sellers at least $400m in commissions. James A Griffin, deputy attorney general in charge of the criminal antitrust enforcement programme, said: \"This case will show that these individuals mastered the art of price fixing.\"</p> <p>Last night Sir Anthony, 70, said he would refuse to answer the charges. They are not a criminal offence in the UK or throughout Europe and therefore the US authorities have no power to extradite. But Sir Anthony will never again be able to travel to America. If he did he would be arrested.</p> <p><b>British citizen</b><br></p> <p>In a statement, lawyers for the former Guinness boss said: \"Sir Anthony wishes to make it clear that he is completely innocent of any involvement in price fixing.</p> <p>\"As a UK subject, Sir Anthony is not subject to the jurisdiction of the US courts and, accordingly, he will not be taking part in any pending proceedings.\"</p> <p>The statement added that Sir Anthony's role as chairman of the auction house was to \"chair the board and to perform high-level ambassadorial and client relationship duties on the company's behalf\".</p> <p>It added that \"executive responsibilities rested with the chief executive\". Sir Anthony's chief executive was Christopher Davidge, who stepped down from his post after agreeing to help the US authorities in return for immunity from prosecution. To retain that immunity, however, he must be able to show that he was acting under orders.</p> <p>A friend of Sir Anthony's said last night: \"He won't go and stand trial. He is 70 and he has done nothing wrong. Why should he spend a great bundle of his time and money on something he has no responsibility to answer? His job was just to go round shaking hands and being nice to clients. He has no faith in the US justice system.\"</p> <p>However, in refusing to take the stand and deny that he colluded in the case, Sir Anthony will strengthen the US government's case against Mr Taubman. The 75-year-old Detroit shopping mall tycoon, who bought Sotheby's in 1983, is expected to defend himself vigorously against charges that he fixed prices in a bid to increase profits.</p> <p>In a statement yesterday, he said: \"I am surprised and deeply disappointed by the charges made against me. I am absolutely innocent.\"</p> <p>Mr Taubman has conducted a very public defence of his career ever since his former deputy, Diana \"DeDe\" Brooks implicated him in the case last year. He took a lie detector test, which he said yesterday proved his innocence. \"The truth is on my side. While any trial is difficult, I look forward to the opportunity to clear my name in court.\"</p> <p><b>Price fixing</b><br></p> <p>The scandal first unfolded when senior executives at Christie's - which was bought by French billionaire Fran\u00e7ois Pinault in 1998 - decided to cooperate with the US authorities in return for immunity from prosecution. They outlined details of price fixing which led to the $512m fine to pay for damages last year.</p> <p>DeDe Brooks, one of the best-known and most powerful women in the global art world when she was the chief executive of Sotheby's, appeared in court to plead guilty to antitrust violations last October. She said she was acting \"at the direction of a superior at Sotheby's\".

      "bodyText": "The US government yesterday indicted Sir Anthony Tennant, a pillar of the British business establishment, and Alfred Taubman, the US shopping mall tycoon, for masterminding an alleged price-fixing scandal at the world's leading art auction houses. Sir Anthony, best known as the man called in to restore the reputation of Guinness after the 1980s share scandal, and the former chairman of Christie's, and Mr Taubman, the owner and former chairman of Sotheby's, face up to three years in prison if they are found guilty of colluding to fix commission charges - but Sir Anthony immediately made it clear he would refuse to answer the charges. Yesterday's criminal charges follow a four-year investigation into the \u00a32.5bn a year art auction market which has thrown the rarefied and exclusive world into turmoil. The scandal - which has already led to a $512m (\u00a3360m) fine for the two auction houses - now threatens to drag both septuagenarians into a courtroom after impressive careers on either side of the Atlantic. The bulk of the evidence against them - said to include memos and other documents - has been provided by their previous underlings, who insist that they are not prepared to take any blame. The two auction houses, which control more than 90% of the world's live auctions of art works, jewellery and furniture, are said to have conspired to fix prices for a period of six years, and the US department of justice claims the arrangement was thrashed out in private meetings between Mr Taubman and Sir Anthony. The former Christie's chairman admits the two men held meetings, but insists they were \"innocent\" and that there was no collusion to rip off the auction houses' wealthy clients. The justice department said the two undercut each other's offers to sellers, costing sellers their principal bargaining tool. It calculates that the agreement cost US sellers at least $400m in commissions. James A Griffin, deputy attorney general in charge of the criminal antitrust enforcement programme, said: \"This case will show that these individuals mastered the art of price fixing.\" Last night Sir Anthony, 70, said he would refuse to answer the charges. They are not a criminal offence in the UK or throughout Europe and therefore the US authorities have no power to extradite. But Sir Anthony will never again be able to travel to America. If he did he would be arrested. British citizen In a statement, lawyers for the former Guinness boss said: \"Sir Anthony wishes to make it clear that he is completely innocent of any involvement in price fixing. \"As a UK subject, Sir Anthony is not subject to the jurisdiction of the US courts and, accordingly, he will not be taking part in any pending proceedings.\" The statement added that Sir Anthony's role as chairman of the auction house was to \"chair the board and to perform high-level ambassadorial and client relationship duties on the company's behalf\". It added that \"executive responsibilities rested with the chief executive\". Sir Anthony's chief executive was Christopher Davidge, who stepped down from his post after agreeing to help the US authorities in return for immunity from prosecution. To retain that immunity, however, he must be able to show that he was acting under orders. A friend of Sir Anthony's said last night: \"He won't go and stand trial. He is 70 and he has done nothing wrong. Why should he spend a great bundle of his time and money on something he has no responsibility to answer? His job was just to go round shaking hands and being nice to clients. He has no faith in the US justice system.\" However, in refusing to take the stand and deny that he colluded in the case, Sir Anthony will strengthen the US government's case against Mr Taubman. The 75-year-old Detroit shopping mall tycoon, who bought Sotheby's in 1983, is expected to defend himself vigorously against charges that he fixed prices in a bid to increase profits. In a statement yesterday, he said: \"I am surprised and deeply disappointed by the charges made against me. I am absolutely innocent.\" Mr Taubman has conducted a very public defence of his career ever since his former deputy, Diana \"DeDe\" Brooks implicated him in the case last year. He took a lie detector test, which he said yesterday proved his innocence. \"The truth is on my side. While any trial is difficult, I look forward to the opportunity to clear my name in court.\" Price fixing The scandal first unfolded when senior executives at Christie's - which was bought by French billionaire Fran\u00e7ois Pinault in 1998 - decided to cooperate with the US authorities in return for immunity from prosecution. They outlined details of price fixing which led to the $512m fine to pay for damages last year. DeDe Brooks, one of the best-known and most powerful women in the global art world when she was the chief executive of Sotheby's, appeared in court to plead guilty to antitrust violations last October. She said she was acting \"at the direction of a superior at Sotheby's\". Her only superior was Mr Taubman. Mr Taubman again refuted his former protege's statement yesterday and said she was acting \"without my authorisation\". He has sought to subpoena documents from Christie's and question Mr Davidge, who left Christie's in December 1999 and is reportedly travelling in India. Mr Taubman resigned as chairman of the company last year and is understood to have put his 63% stake up for sale. Sir Anthony, who receives a \u00a3500,000 a year pension from Guinness, was relaxing at his Hampshire home yesterday. He was said to have been expecting the indictment. His name has been on \"border watch\" in the US for some time, and he recently stood down as a senior adviser to US investment bank Morgan Stanley Dean Witter as he was unable to travel to the US. Michael Sovern, who took over as chairman of Sotheby's when Mr Taubman stepped down last year, said: \"We cannot but feel for Alfred Taubman and his family at this difficult time.\" He made no further comment, apart from stressing that all civil and criminal charges against the company itself had been settled. Accused: Sir Anthony Tennant Sir Anthony Tennant was the \"Mr Clean\" brought in to restore Guinness's reputation after the share-rigging scandal of the 80s which put the brewer's chief executive Ernest Saunders in jail. By the time he left Guinness in 1993 Sir Anthony had become a grandee of British business. Educated at Eton and Cambridge, and after a spell in the Scots Guards, he spent his career in the brewing and drinks industry before joining the auctioneers Christies. He was knighted in 1992 and now chairs the Royal Academy Trust. He retired from Guinness on a \u00a3500,000 a year pension. Recently he has taken a campaign to the high court to prevent the Olympic champion marksman Richard Faulds from practising his shooting on his family's Hampshire farm . Sir Anthony claimed the noise affected house prices. Julia Finch Accused: Alfred Taubman Adolph Alfred Taubman had made himself a billionaire many times over through a successful shopping mall business by the early 1980s. But his life lacked glamour. That changed in 1983 when he married a former Miss Israel 22 years his junior and was approached by Sotheby's about a takeover. For the avid art buyer, the chance to own the 256-year-old auctioneer was a dream come true. It was also said to be a fitting wedding present for his wife. The couple were soon a fixture at all the best parties. They flew in their own Gulfstream jet, owned five homes, which they decorated with priceless works of art, and had a retinue of servants. His fortunes survived the economic downturn in the early 1990s before being rocked by the price-fixing scandal, which has already cost him personally $156m. Jane Martinson",

Lord Harris of Haringey heard early on Saturday that door staff at the Fridge club in Brixton, south London, had claimed to have found ecstasy tablets on his 17-year-old son Matthew. But Lord Harris did not refer the matter to Scotland Yard until Monday - after a national newspaper had contacted him about the episode. If detectives discover that Lord Harris tried to cover up the incident, it could make his position as chairman of the Metropolitan police authority, which oversees the running of the capital's force, untenable.

Neither of the parties to the case - a pawnbroker, First County Trust, and Penelope Wilson, from Knightsbridge, central London, who pawned her BMW - had relied on the Human Rights Act in the appeal from a county court judgment over a \u00a35,000 loan. The judges - the vice-chancellor, Sir Andrew Morritt, Lord Justice Chadwick and Lord Justice Rix - adjourned the appeal last November to allow the trade secretary, Stephen Byers, time to brief lawyers to oppose the declaration, but had provisionally concluded that a section of the act which barred FCT from enforcing the credit agreement because of a technical error breached its human rights. In drawing up the agreement FCT wrongly added the \u00a3250 charge for preparing the document to the \u00a35,000 loan. The document declared the amount of the loan as \u00a35,250, instead of \u00a35,000. Under the act, the court has power to enforce an agreement despite certain errors, but not if the amount of the loan is not stated correctly. The result was that Mrs Wilson got back her car and the \u00a36,900 she paid for the loan, interest and charges. The government now has to decide whether to appeal or amend the law.",

The search for a ceasefire deal with the Palestinians by Shimon Peres, the foreign secretary, was undermined all through the day by the government leader, Ariel Sharon. Mr Peres, the dove in the cabinet, was in Washington yesterday to try to get the US president, George Bush, and the US secretary of state, Colin Powell, to support a ceasefire plan sponsored by Jordan and Egypt. His tone towards the Palestinians was conciliatory. But Mr Sharon, a hardline rightwinger, repeatedly scuppered his efforts. Among other moves, he ordered another army incursion into Palestinian land at Rafah in the Gaza Strip. During this, a 17-year-old Palestinian was killed. The Israelis quickly withdrew, after bulldozing buildings. Last month, a similar incursion - also into land handed over to the Palestinians under the 1993 Oslo peace accords with Israel - was reversed by Mr Sharon after a rebuke by Mr Powell. In a declaration guaranteed to provoke the Palestinians, Mr Sharon announced during a West Bank tour that the Jordan valley, which forms the West Bank's border with Jordan, would be Israel's forever. Earlier this year, Israel's previous Labour government promised during negotiations with the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, to withdraw from the Jordan valley after six years. Mr Sharon also ruled out a freeze on Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza, one of the Palestinian demands in the Jordan-Egypt plan. Visiting the West Bank settlement of Ofra to express condolences to the family of a settler killed on Tuesday, Mr Sharon rejected concessions for the Palestinians in return for a ceasefire: \"There is no payment for stopping terror.\" He held out little prospect of a truce, and his deputy public security minister, Gideon Ezra, went further, saying publicly that a ceasefire might make matters worse for Israel by giving the Palestinians an opportunity to re-arm. After a meeting of his \"security cabinet\" in Ofra, Mr Sharon told settler demonstrators: \"If Arafat does not deal with terror, we will deal with terror... We have an interest in preventing an escalation. But we haven't used all the possibilities to bring an end to terror. And these things we will do.\" Some of those methods, he said, may not be overt - a reference to assassinations and bombings carried out by the Israeli intelligence service.

Ever since the disastrous flotation of <strong>Orange</strong> earlier this year it has been thought that institutions would only subscribe for new telecom shares at fire sale prices. </p> <p>But yesterday UBS Warburg and Goldman Sachs comfortably managed to sell \u00a33.5bn worth of <strong>Vodafone</strong> stock to City investors, in what was the second largest one-day share placing ever. </p> <p>The speed and the level at which the operation was completed stunned even the most seasoned market professionals. </p> <p>According to market sources the offer had to be increased from \u00a33bn to \u00a33.5bn to satisfy demand and the shares are likely to be placed at 194p - a small discount to Vodafone's closing price of 199p, down 7.25p. </p> <p>Vodafone will use the proceeds to help fund the purchases of <strong>BT's</strong> stakes in Japan Telecom and Airtel, the Spanish mobile phone company. BT shares fell 7p to 592p. </p> <p>\"It went better than anyone could have expected. They [UBS and Goldman] are very pleased with the outcome,\" the source said. </p> <p>All things considered it was not a bad day for the London market.

      "bodyText": "Now we know for sure: there is still appetite for telecoms paper. Ever since the disastrous flotation of Orange earlier this year it has been thought that institutions would only subscribe for new telecom shares at fire sale prices. But yesterday UBS Warburg and Goldman Sachs comfortably managed to sell \u00a33.5bn worth of Vodafone stock to City investors, in what was the second largest one-day share placing ever. The speed and the level at which the operation was completed stunned even the most seasoned market professionals. According to market sources the offer had to be increased from \u00a33bn to \u00a33.5bn to satisfy demand and the shares are likely to be placed at 194p - a small discount to Vodafone's closing price of 199p, down 7.25p. Vodafone will use the proceeds to help fund the purchases of BT's stakes in Japan Telecom and Airtel, the Spanish mobile phone company. BT shares fell 7p to 592p. \"It went better than anyone could have expected. They [UBS and Goldman] are very pleased with the outcome,\" the source said. All things considered it was not a bad day for the London market. The blue-chip index finished just 23.8 points lower at 5.904.2, with weakness in Vodafone offset by rising tech stocks. The FTSE Techmark 100 index rose 23.16 points to 2,103.84, with bears being forced to square short positions after a robust overnight showing from Nasdaq.

      "body": "<p>Trevor Philipson, who has died of liver failure aged 53, infused glamour and sparkle to the commercial bar, a branch of the legal profession that does not attract much public attention or produce media stars. The country's leading practitioner in civil aviation law, both as counsel and arbitrator, he first made his mark in the early 1980s, at the Heathrow Terminal 4 inquiry.</p> <p>For Trevor, the courtroom was a stage, on which he demanded of himself the highest standards of performance. His style was characterised by the sheer hard work that went into preparation, his courtesy and charm, and his devastating skills in cross-examination. A trade-mark of his was to beguile a witness with the charm, then to strike with a rapier-thrust when it was least expected. Very theatrical, very effective. He used spectacles as a stage prop in cross-examination, rather than for ophthalmic purposes, and once drove through the night before a case, to retrieve them from a car that had broken down on him in north Wales.</p> <p>Trevor was able, professionally, to grasp the most complex technological detail, ranging from aircraft avionics systems to yogurt production processes.

      "bodyText": "Trevor Philipson, who has died of liver failure aged 53, infused glamour and sparkle to the commercial bar, a branch of the legal profession that does not attract much public attention or produce media stars. The country's leading practitioner in civil aviation law, both as counsel and arbitrator, he first made his mark in the early 1980s, at the Heathrow Terminal 4 inquiry. For Trevor, the courtroom was a stage, on which he demanded of himself the highest standards of performance. His style was characterised by the sheer hard work that went into preparation, his courtesy and charm, and his devastating skills in cross-examination. A trade-mark of his was to beguile a witness with the charm, then to strike with a rapier-thrust when it was least expected. Very theatrical, very effective. He used spectacles as a stage prop in cross-examination, rather than for ophthalmic purposes, and once drove through the night before a case, to retrieve them from a car that had broken down on him in north Wales. Trevor was able, professionally, to grasp the most complex technological detail, ranging from aircraft avionics systems to yogurt production processes. But in his personal life he was notoriously impractical: even his mobile telephones seldom worked. Trevor was born in the north-east, and educated at the Royal Grammar School, Newcastle, where he was head boy, played Hamlet and wondered seriously about the stage as a career. He read law at Wadham College, Oxford, but glandular fever prevented him from sitting his finals, which enraged him, and he duly took a first in the bachelor of civil law exam at Oxford the following year. The definitive work on civil aviation law, to which he was the principal contributor, is The Law Of Carriage By Air, which was published earlier this year. He became a QC in 1989, and developed a strong reputation in the field of professional negligence and trusts, acting in a number of landmark cases. Success allowed him to spend much time in his lovely chateau in the foothills of the Pyrenees. This in turn allowed him to indulge in three passions: gardening, interior design and strenuous hill-walking. In the mid-1970s, Trevor married Victoria Haskard, an Oxford friend. The marriage did not last and they had no children, but they remained good friends. By the early 1980s, work took Trevor to south-east Asia, where he met Thai Ping Wong, a man who shared his passions for spectacle, theatre, art, gardening and interior design. Thus began a partnership that has been a strong creative force for the last 16 years. It took not a little courage, on his part, to confront a conservative profession with the challenge of being gay. To the bar's credit, and his own, his career appeared to have suffered not a scrap. Trevor had an enormous circle of friends, and the head of his chambers, Fountain Court, observed that he was one of the commercial bar's best-liked practitioners. He is survived by his mother Rosalind; his sister Carol and her family; numerous godchildren; and his partner Thai Ping Wong. \u0095 Trevor Philipson, barrister, born March 3 1948; died April 17 2001",

Neither an entirely historical documentary nor one with enough contemporary context to make it feel genuinely current, it was a case of spectacle over substance, even if Carrie Fisher was on hand to add some intellectual ballast. Throw in the surgery of Susan Miller, a former model and actress, whose rejuvenation we got to see in bloody detail (the surgeons fingers under the skin on her forehead and everything) and it's clear that Hollywood Knives would have made three interesting half-hour documentaries as opposed to a pseudo-serious 60 minute mish-mash. </p> <p>Hollywood Knives only gave the merest hint at the self-loathing, insecurity and/or genuine desire to improve oneself that drives people to have plastic surgery. Only someone quite comfortable with themselves wouldn't grab the opportunity to, as Susan Miller says, look like yourself, only better. </p> <p>But what felt like the biggest missed opportunity of all came when Hollywood Knives didn't mention that actually, most Hollywood stars - and by extension, most celebs - aren't conventionally good looking. Well they're not, are they? From Sinatra to Vince Vaughn, Greta Garbo to Cameron Diaz: they aren't truly beautiful people. What they have is star quality, but it's not beauty (as anyone who has seen Diaz without her make-up will testify).

The catering, she could handle, but their on-pitch failings weren't so easy to mend. Falling down their division like a bad souffl\u00e9, the team were a big disappointment, and when the manager quit after pressure from the press, Delia cried, \"It's wicked and shameful\". Of course, had she been any other owner of a football team, she would have resorted to the old, \"You can't make an omelette without breaking eggs.\" </p> <p>With impressive access to Delia, this film was, like Hollywood Knives, one which wasn't as revealing as it might have been.

      "bodyText": "A former member of the Ku Klux Klan was in jail for life yesterday for the murder almost 38 years ago of four black girls who died when their church in Birmingham, Alabama, was bombed - an event which became a turning point in the civil rights movement of the 1960s. Thomas Blanton, 62, intends to appeal on the grounds that he could not get a fair trial in Birmingham and that he was not tried by his peers: there were no white men on the jury which took 150 minutes to convict him. \"I guess the good Lord will settle on judgment day,\" Blanton said on Tuesday before he was led from the court in Birmingham, a city where the Klan once used so much dynamite that it was known as Bombingham. He was one of four men named in an FBI report soon after the explosion at the 16th Street Baptist church in 1963 killed a girl of 11 and three others aged 14. No case was brought at the time. Subsequently, one of the four died in jail and a second without going to trial. Blanton and Bob Frank Cherry were indicted by a grand jury last year, but Mr Cherry's trail was postponed on the grounds of mental incapacity. Yesterday the Rev Abraham Woods, a black minister who helped to persuade the FBI to reopen the case, said: \"Now it's time to go after Cherry. I am tired of hearing about his mental competency. They have tried mentally retarded black men.\" The strongest evidence against Blanton was on secret FBI tapes of his conversations after the bombings. The FBI director J Edgar Hoover resisted attempts by his Birmingham office to take the four to court, trial despite pressure from Presidents John F Kennedy and Lyndon B Johnson. Hoover feared what would happen if witnesses felt too intimidated to testify, and he believed that no jury would convict them. Craig Dahle, an FBI special agent in Birmingham, said yesterday: \"Reviews of the files showed to us that back in the 60s the case was worked actively and Hoover never blocked the case. He was worried about getting a conviction.\" 'I like to go bombing' The tapes do not capture Blanton saying that he bombed the church, but he did boast to a friend: \"I like to go shooting, I like to go fishing, I like to go bombing.\" In another recording he spoke to his wife about a Klan meeting \"when we planned the bomb\". His wife asked: \"Tommy, what meeting are you talking about.\" He replied: \"We had that meeting to make the bomb.\" He also talked about bombings in general to a friend who had turned FBI informer. \"They ain't gonna catch me when I bomb my next church,\" he said. The prosecution told the jury of eight whites and four blacks that these were the words of the 16th Street bomber; the defence claimed that they were the ravings of a racist redneck braggart. Doug Jones, the US attorney who prosecuted, said it was \"not an overwhelming case.\" Witnesses had died over the years, and one who had intended to testify was unable to do so because of having a stroke. Richard Arrington, who was the city's first black mayor, said afterwards: \"It's a very positive development. It was one of the most heinous crimes in this country. There have always been those who have said it would be better to let this go, but I believe that is a minority voice.

There was a conspiracy of silence. No politician in Alabama would touch the case.

Ms Khosravi, a junior civil servant, hopes to become the first woman presidential candidate; the only woman who previously attempted to stand was barred by the 12-man Guardians Council in 1997. The official Islamic Republic News Agency described her as \"liberal minded\". She and her supporters handed roses to journalists and officials during the registration process. In the course of the day 67 candidates registered, including a publisher, a street hawker and a municipal cleaner. But there was still no word whether President Mohammad Khatami, who has kept the country guessing about his plans, will be standing. Nominations close on Sunday, and all candidates have to be vetted by the Guardians Council. It has already rejected 145 out of the 356 candidates who registered for parliamentary by-elections on June 8, the same day as the presidential election. The Iranian constitution says candidates must be \"political or religious figures\", but it is not clear if this means they must be male. The Farsi word for \"figures\" is rejal , derived from the Arabic word for a man. The council, which will rule on May 18, has to give its reasons for rejecting candidates. To reject one on the grounds of gender would be controversial, but it could rely on the well-used formula \"non-conformity with Islam\". \"The law is not clear, but I hope the council will accept my candidacy,\" Ms Khosravi said, adding that she intended to focus her campaign on education and the economy. President Khatami swept to power in 1997 with nearly 70% of the vote on a reform platform which had overwhelming support from women and young people. There is little doubt that he will win a second term if he stands, but he has been keeping everyone in suspense about his intentions. It is unclear whether he faces a genuine dilemma or is employing a tactic to throw conservatives off balance. Stiff opposition from the conservatives, who control such key state institutions as the courts and police, has thwarted his efforts to liberalise Iran during his first term. More than 30, mostly reform-minded newspapers have been closed since last year, and many of Mr Khatami's political allies have been removed from office or jailed. In an ambiguous statement to parliament last month, Mr Khatami said: \"As long as I am convinced that I am able to put a step forward, in spite of all problems and as long as the people wish it, I will be ready to serve.\" Reformers accuse the conservatives entrenched in the judiciary of mounting a campaign to deter him from standing and to weaken his support among the electorate. Mohsen Armin, a leading reformist member of parliament, said in a recent interview: \"The pressures ... are all to prevent Mr Khatami from participating in the elections, and are all carried out by the extremist authoritarian sector of the right faction.\" But as long as Mr Khatami refuses to show his hand, the conservatives are uncertain what to do about the election.",

      "bodyText": "Yesterday's opening of Luciano Pavarotti's trial for alleged tax evasion cast melancholy over celebrations marking the distinguished tenor's 40 years on the operatic stage. Pavarotti did not attend the court session in his home town of Modena in northern Italy; the hearing was devoted to legal arguments and adjourned after just one hour. But he is expected to exercise his vocal cords in the unusual setting of a court of law when the trial resumes in September. Prosecutors claim that the world's best known tenor failed to declare earnings of about 40bn lire (\u00a313m) to the Italian tax authorities between 1989 and 1995. In 1991, they allege, he reported an income, from rent, of just over \u00a31,000 while actually earning more than \u00a32m from musical engagements around the world. He risks a maximum penalty of three years in prison if convicted. Pavarotti has argued that in financial terms he was resident in Monte Carlo at the time and paid taxes on his earnings in the various countries where he worked. Italian tax authorities have always insisted that Modena was the centre of his business and personal affairs - they say he owns not only his large villa but also 11 companies and other property there - so he should have been declaring his earnings to them. Pavarotti conceded the point, in effect, when he reached a settlement with the finance ministry last July, agreeing to begin paying back-taxes of approximately \u00a38m in instalments. He was feted at the time by Ottaviano Del Turco, the finance minister, who welcomed his return to the fiscal fold in a media event at his ministerial office in Rome. \"I don't feel like a tax evader,\" Pavarotti said then. \"I simply misinterpreted an unclear law.\" He has already been convicted, in 1999, on a tax-evasion charge. Problems with the tax authorities have combined with a messy divorce from his wife of more than 30 years and doubts about the quality of his voice to eclipse the latter stages of a career that established him as arguably the greatest operatic voice of the digital recording age. His career was celebrated on Sunday, when Pavarotti, 66, returned to the opera house in Modena for a gala with many stars to mark his professional debut in La Boh\u00e8me exactly 40 years earlier. Even if the court case goes well for him, the tax wrangles have taken a toll of the tenor's prestige and threatened to impinge on his lucrative sideline in advertising endorsements.",

As that comment reveals, Vialli isn't very familiar with the Hertfordshire town. His career has taken him from European Cup glory with Juventus to four years with the Kings Road fancy dans at Chelsea. He is a football aristocrat, the cultured face of the sport. Think boutiques, books and bistros, sharp suits and softly spoken words. Watford, in the words of Vince of the town council, will present its new manager with \"a different set of challenges\". </p> <p><strong> Shopping</strong> </p> <p>Versace, Armani, Vialli. The Italians like to dress posh. For Gianluca, Chelsea's allure must have been its reputation as London's nerve centre of chic. There was Emporio Armani, Issey Miyake, Gucci and Hackett. The man's got to stay looking good for those Match of the Day moments, even if it is on the riff-raff's channel next year. So where can he turn to in Watford? The town that gave the world Nick Leeson is hot on commerce. \"We're a very big centre for shopping in this area\", says the town council. Mall-happy Watfordians tend to gather in the Harlequin Centre in the heart of town. Inside is the illustrious local department store, Trewins (its rival, Clements, can be found a short distance away). In the unlikely circumstance of neither of these appealing to Vialli's urbane tastes, there are sure to be other stores that do - for example, Watford definitely has a Gap. </p> <p><strong> Restaurants</strong> </p> <p>It's \u00a360 a head in Bibendum on the Fulham Road - unless, like a prole, you stay downstairs in the oyster bar for champagne and molluscs. Gordon Ramsay's Aubergine nosh-shop on Chelsea's Park Walk is a smidgen cheaper. For the green, green pesto of home, meanwhile, it was a quick hike for Vialli to nearby Hammersmith and the River Cafe. As for Watford? Well, the Carnevale on St Albans Road does a mean calzone. </p> <p><strong> Nightlife</strong> </p> <p>\"He'll get a slightly different type of nightlife in Watford\", says Vince. What can he mean? \"We tend to get more people in the town centre on a Saturday night than ever go to the football. But they're mostly 18- to 25-year-olds. It's fair to say Watford-at-night attracts a fair degree of talent.\" If Watford's most famous daughter, Geri Halliwell, offers any indication, it's talent of the brassy variety. Whereas in SW1 you can't move for brainless toffs in crystal stilettos, there have been no recent sightings of Lady Victoria Hervey and Tara Palmer-Tomkinson at the Colosseum nitespot. Although that could change when, on May 19, Bjorn Again come to town. </p> <p><strong> Culture</strong> </p> <p>This is where Watford really scores. Gianluca's new life will be a constant round of challenging civic expression and lively local performance. Every August, It hosts the biggest Hare Krishna festival in the world outside India, due to the proximity of the sect's HQ - Bhaktivedanta Manor. The town's streets positively twinkle with art. There's the \"WWW\" sculpture in the cafe quarter, the all-new sensory garden, and the memory wall near Watford pond, towards which the football club's new gaffer will doubtless wish to contribute, by submitting a personal trinket congealed within a resin brick. </p> <p>The Palace Theatre (\"rivalling anything in the West End and it's on your doorstep!\", exclaims the Herts Advertiser) could use the ex-Chelsea star's help with fundraising. Celebrities currently attached include Matthew Kelly and Valerie Singleton. Clement Freud hosted a solo entertainment last weekend, although Vialli may shudder at the theatre's current main house production, a play about vigilante grannies. Is this how the locals will react to a poor run of footballing form? Next up at the Palace is a play by former Chelsea resident Oscar Wilde, whose quip about \"some of us\" being \"in the gutter\" may offer Vialli succour through the dark First Division winter ahead. </p> <p><strong> Community</strong> </p> <p>In Chelsea, it means the blue-rinse brigade gathering to anoint a Clark or a Portillo. Or, on a more benevolent day, shaven-headed footie fans gathering to plot the destruction of another European market town. In Watford, there really is a community, and the football club is vital to it. \"His biggest challenge,\" says Vince at the town council, \"will be following Graham Taylor. Graham was part of the Watford family. People know each other round here.\" </p> <p>If one accusation has bedevilled Chelsea FC, during and after Vialli's reign, it's that they can't stomach the trips to unfashionable places such as Barnsley, Charlton and, er, Watford. Now Gianluca is expected to make such a place home. \"There's an expectation,\" says Vince, \"that when he needs to be here, he will be.\" Benvenuto, boss!</p>",

They can get cheap shiitake mushrooms and spring onions from China for half the price of domestic fare. New brands of cheap, reduced-alcohol beer appear almost every other month and the big brewers have responded by cutting the prices of their top lagers by 10%. If one wants a western-style snack, McDonald's has a special midweek offer of \u00a565 (36p) for a hamburger. Yoshinoya, a Japanese-style fast-food rival, has responded by cutting the price of its gyudon (a bowl of beef and rice) from \u00a5400 to \u00a5250. To wash it down, a tall latte from Starbucks is only \u00a5320 - less than half the cost of a small cup at an old-style coffee shop. </p> <p>Clothes are a snip thanks to a burgeoning number of discount stores. At Uniqlo, which imports from China, one can pick up five pairs of good quality socks for \u00a51,000. There are even bargains in Ginza - Tokyo's Knightsbridge - where The Suit Co offers a trouser-jacket combination for just \u00a519,000 which would previously have been three times that price. Even telephone bills will get cheaper next month when NTT cuts its charge for local calls by 15% - the first time the rate has been reduced. </p> <p>According to government statistics, clothing prices fell 1.7% last year, video recorders were down 5.6% and golf course fees and karaoke studio rentals declined by more than 3%. This year, air fares and utilities' costs are forecast to make even bigger drops. </p> <p>Along with a slide in prices has come a shift in values. Magazines and TV shows specialising in discount shopping information testify to the way frugality has become fashionable. </p> <p>According to economist Noriko Hama of the Mitsubishi Research Institute, it is as if Japanese consumers have turned off Dallas and tuned in to Coronation Street. \"Deflation is not good for any economy, but it has helped to waken people up. The mentality is very different from the bubble era. It is much more down to earth.\" </p> <p>With savings increasing - the average Japanese family has \u00a387,000 stashed away - consumers are comfortable with the gentle declines they have experienced so far. It may even be a long overdue sign that the country's infamously workaholic population is starting to chill out. So, despite the dismal statistics, the night clubs of the trendy Shibuya district are overflowing, new skyscrapers are rising in the business district and the latest additions to the Tokyo Bay skyline are two huge ferris wheels.</p>",

To wash it down, a tall latte from Starbucks is only \u00a5320 - less than half the cost of a small cup at an old-style coffee shop. Clothes are a snip thanks to a burgeoning number of discount stores. At Uniqlo, which imports from China, one can pick up five pairs of good quality socks for \u00a51,000. There are even bargains in Ginza - Tokyo's Knightsbridge - where The Suit Co offers a trouser-jacket combination for just \u00a519,000 which would previously have been three times that price. Even telephone bills will get cheaper next month when NTT cuts its charge for local calls by 15% - the first time the rate has been reduced. According to government statistics, clothing prices fell 1.7% last year, video recorders were down 5.6% and golf course fees and karaoke studio rentals declined by more than 3%. This year, air fares and utilities' costs are forecast to make even bigger drops. Along with a slide in prices has come a shift in values. Magazines and TV shows specialising in discount shopping information testify to the way frugality has become fashionable. According to economist Noriko Hama of the Mitsubishi Research Institute, it is as if Japanese consumers have turned off Dallas and tuned in to Coronation Street. \"Deflation is not good for any economy, but it has helped to waken people up. The mentality is very different from the bubble era. It is much more down to earth.\" With savings increasing - the average Japanese family has \u00a387,000 stashed away - consumers are comfortable with the gentle declines they have experienced so far. It may even be a long overdue sign that the country's infamously workaholic population is starting to chill out. So, despite the dismal statistics, the night clubs of the trendy Shibuya district are overflowing, new skyscrapers are rising in the business district and the latest additions to the Tokyo Bay skyline are two huge ferris wheels.",

Instead, he set a series of records on the world's highest mountain that were designed to catch the media's attention and so generate the kind of public profile that would provide a long-term income for himself, his wife and their six daughters.</p> <p>These records culminated last year in his sprint to the summit in 16 hours 56 minutes from base camp, a climb that takes most mountaineers three or four days. The previous year he spent 21 hours on the summit itself, sheltering in a small tent and chattering through the long frozen night into his radio, even singing Nepali folk songs, to avoid falling into a sleep from which doctors warned he might never wake up.</p> <p>But if Babu's achievements were a deliberate attempt to win fame, then he learned the lesson from those western and Japanese climbers who had relied for years on sherpas like him to do exactly the same thing. And Babu's immense strength illustrated that when it came to climbing the very highest Himalayan peaks, admittedly by their easier routes, hardly any foreign climbers could come close to Babu and his people.</p> <p>Nor was he some starry-eyed romantic who mythologised the mountain's appeal. \"A lot of sherpas go to the mountain with fear,\" he once said, \"but that's no way to climb. They have to go, because it's a job and they're being well paid for it. If they don't have any education, they don't have a choice.\" To that end, Babu was working to build a school at Traksindo, near his home village of Chhulemu in Solukhumbu district, in the shadow of the mountain that sherpas call Chomolungma.</p> <p>Babu Chhiri was born the fourth of eight children. His father, Lhakpa Sherpa, was a farmer and trader who had carried a load to Everest's base camp for John Hunt's expedition in 1953. Babu grew up tending the family's yaks and had no formal schooling, something he deeply regretted. He learned English, like many sherpas, as he went along the mountain trails with the tourists he worked for.</p> <p>At 16 he married his wife Puti, but Babu had secretly decided to follow two of his brothers to Kathmandu to find work in the rapidly growing trekking industry. On his first job he earned around 10 pence a day carrying a 30-kilo load up and down the steep trails of Nepal. He returned to his village broke and in tears after spending his earnings on food and bus fares.</p> <p>Two years later he tried again, this time as a cook boy, and slowly he worked his way up to better and more lucrative jobs. His break came in 1989, still aged only 23, as a climbing sherpa on a Russian expedition to the world's third-highest peak, Kangchenjunga. He reached the summit without bottled oxygen and discovered he was supremely adapted for living at high altitude. \"It was like an exam,\" he said, and one that he passed with flying colours.</p> <p>The following year he climbed Everest for the first time with the Frenchman Marc Batard and his new career - as a personality in his own right - took shape. He would reach the summit a further nine times, including two ascents in two weeks in 1995, and be feted as a national hero by King Birendra.</p> <p>A stocky man with a Buddha-like paunch - he would often praise his wife's cooking - Babu made friends easily, not just in Nepal but in America and Europe, where he understood the real money in climbing lay. But he saw a future for the sherpas, and for his children, outside climbing.</p> <p>Babu was a safe mountaineer, as well as a strong one.

      "body": "<p>Stephen Poliakoff made a wager with the BBC: if they would stop being frenetic, forget market research and trust the audience, they would not regret it. \"Just give me four hours of screen time and I will deliver original, quality drama,\" he told the director of television, Mark Thompson. The result is the three-part serial Perfect Strangers, which opens with a 90-minute episode next week. The drama, which could be summed up as ruminations on the excavation of a family's past, has no violence, and whatever discreet bonking there is has a curiously virginal quality. </p> <p>\"I proposed - bloody-mindedly I suppose - to compel audiences to slow down,\" Poliakoff says, ensconced in a deep armchair in an absurdly ornate draped bedroom at Claridges, which has been taken over by the BBC's film crew. \"I wanted to go back to long scenes - not six-second takes. Long scenes can be very compulsive.\" </p> <p>Poliakoff is the Cambridge whizz-kid who was writer in residence at the National Theatre at 24, author of Caught on a Train, Close My Eyes, and at least one thundering miss: 1998's The Tribe, a drama about a cult starring Anna Friel. He made an immediate recovery two years ago with Shooting the Past. </p> <p>Poliakoff is well aware of the post-Birt climate in which he is now working: too much damage was done to creative drama by the suits with their \"Producer's Choice\" - which translated as a mission to downsize or tame the unreliable creatives. The BBC now has a bad conscience. \"In the past few years there had been a huge shrinkage in drama output,\" Poliakoff says. \"There was a department that used to be called television plays. It completely vanished one summer, unmourned and largely unremarked by the media. It was the destruction of the single film or play. I was surprised they got away with it, but they did. John Birt should be forever ashamed. </p> <p>He continues: \"It will be interesting to see what happens next in drama. There is a will at the BBC to make good drama, and at Channel 4 too. For the first time there is a senior executive [Thompson] interested in writing. The BBC was passionate to make this.\" </p> <p>The corporation is certainly giving the new serial formidable backing: it is being heavily trailed, with a documentary on Poliakoff's life and work preceding transmission. His acclaimed 1980 TV drama Caught on a Train is also being repeated. </p> <p>The favourable public and critical reaction to Shooting the Past encouraged the BBC to give him complete freedom. \"The press rose to that occasion,\" Poliakoff says grandly. So, it must be said, did the BBC. It could not have failed to identify the target of the serial. Shooting the Past featured corporate figures - tactfully described as American - buying an old-style British photo library with the intention of dumping its 10m photographs and turning it into a business school. In 1988 the BBC decided storage space was too valuable to be cluttered up with old photographs and sold its photo archive for a derisory sum to a cable entrepreneur. </p> <p>Perfect Strangers once again delves into souvenirs of the past. \"That famous quote, 'The past is a foreign country: they do things differently there,' is not true. We overestimate the differences,\" says Poliakoff. The story of a monstrous family reunion in a posh hotel is inspired by his own experience after the death of his father. \"I went into the great ballroom,\" he says, \"and I hardly knew anyone, although they were all related to me.\" </p> <p>In Perfect Strangers the \"pedigree hunter\" Stephen (Anton Lesser), designer of the family tree, hangs a souvenir on each branch that the guests obsessively unravel. The ailing black sheep of the family, played by Michael Gambon, uncovers a remarkable hidden truth about his austere father: what is this amazing home movie showing him cavorting on the lawn while the little boy looks on? And who was he dancing for? His wife goes merrily in search of a distinguished ancestor, and their son discovers he is the eternal go-between when he attempts to heal old wounds. And there is the Holocaust survivor who had to create a whole new family history to survive. </p> <p>Poliakoff has a passion for scrutinising the past like a forensic scientist. He discovers crimes there - mostly of concealment and wondrous insights - that transform the memory of a person. But it is the concealment and distortion that concern him most, particularly those of the war years, although he was born in 1952. \"We were, of course, brainwashed all through the war,\" he says. \"But people were kept in ignorance long after there was no longer a need to suppress the truth. We have quite recently discovered how near we came to oblivion. What damage was done in terms of understanding the place were we live?\" </p> <p>Poliakoff regrets that he left it too late to find out about his own father's early life. \"He was obsessed with his Russian childhood. He had a flat on Red Square and the revolution must have gone on under his window. He was an inventor and helped make the first automatic telephone exchange for the Lenin regime. Even though he fled Stalin, he was regarded as one of the fathers of Soviet technology. He was also one of the first people who caught sound on film. He was a very good storyteller. You had to sit listening to every exact detail before you got to the point - but it was always worth waiting for.\" </p> <p>There is no mistaking the message to the viewers: sit quiet now, don't fidget - it will be worth it in the end. </p> <p>\u0095 Perfect Strangers begins on May 10 on BBC2. Caught on a Train will be shown on Saturday on BBC2, and a documentary profile, Stephen Poliakoff: Shooting the Present, goes out on BBC2 next Tuesday.</p>",

During Sutcliffe's incarceration in Broadmoor Special Hospital in Berkshire, dozens of women have been writing letters to him - sympathetic letters, love letters, even ones discussing marriage. One of these women, Sandra Lester, apparently hoped for a long-term relationship with the convicted murderer.

But Lester, like the other women interviewed in Letters to the Yorkshire Ripper, a documentary to be screened on BBC1 next Wednesday, knew from the start that the man she was writing to had been convicted of some of the most sickening murders in British criminal history. So did Diane Simpson, who has exchanged more than 500 letters with Sutcliffe and spent 400 hours visiting him in Broadmoor over a 10-year period.</p> <p>Why did they do it? Simpson says Sutcliffe kept hinting that he would confess to other crimes; she'd had some professional involvement in the original investigation, as a handwriting analyst, and had remained fascinated with it after his conviction.

For while it is not difficult to see what Sutcliffe got out of it - contact with the outside world, a feeling of importance, perhaps a sexual thrill from the attention of strangers - it is harder to understand why any woman would want an intense relationship with a man who slashed women's bodies with a sharpened screwdriver.</p> <p>The film suggests that Curry's interest in the case eventually became an obsession, while Lester got in touch with Sutcliffe at a vulnerable point in her life, when she was coming to terms with the abuse she had suffered as a child.

Yes, I'm afraid so. There was no easy way to tell you. And the moral of the story is? Two roads diverged in Woolton, and Bill, Bill took the road less travelled by. And that has made all the difference.",

      "body": "<b>Tim Dowling does art</b> <br> <p>If you are going to do anything for 12 hours and 40 minutes, it seems sensible to get an early start. Standing at a bus stop at 7:45am, copy of Time Out in hand, I am determined to look at as much art as possible before the rush, if there is a rush. </p> <p><b> 8.55am:</b> Piccadilly Pret a Manger. While not strictly an art gallery, Pret a Manger does at least have the distinction of being open at 8:55am. By common consent, virtually all galleries and museums open at 10am and shut at 6pm. My task has gone from uphill struggle to impossible mission in the space of an hour. Now I'm looking at a poster and drinking latte. Does this count? </p> <p><b> 9.30am:</b> Agnew's Gallery, Old Bond Street. Agnew's is the only gallery in the West End which opens at 9.30, getting a half-hour jump on the competition. I push the buzzer, pull the door and find myself face to face with the tapestries of Louis Le Brocquy, \"Ireland's most important living artist\". A woman comes up the stairs and says, \"Can I help you?\" in a tone which unmistakably means: \"Please go away.\" She tells me the exhibit doesn't open until Thursday. I attempt to spin out this conversation for another 26 minutes, until the Royal Academy opens. It lasts a further 45 seconds. I am reduced to walking up and down Duke Street examining paintings of ships through security grilles. </p> <p><b> 10am:</b> Royal Academy, Piccadilly. At last, some art. There are extra security guards laid on in anticipation of today's May Day riots, but my art lover disguise (rucksack, wind cheater, sensible shoes) fools them all. Tickets to see Botticelli's drawings for Dante's Divine Comedy cost \u00a37, but it's nice to be indoors. The Sackler wing has been divided into three galleries, Hell, Purgatory and Heaven, and the seven quid entitles me to headphones. I wander through Hell, listening to the commentary and congratulating myself for having never committed the sin of simony (the buying or selling of ecclesiastical pardons, offices, or emoluments). </p> <p>The drawings are beautiful, but most are quite small, and the lighting in the gallery is low. An elderly woman and I are almost cheek to cheek as we examine a tiny sketch of a devil farting. By the time I get to Heaven I am fast-forwarding through the commentary. The later drawings look a bit dashed off. Frankly, if Botticelli can't make the effort, neither can I. </p> <p><b> 10.50am:</b> National Portrait Gallery, Charing Cross. Every horrible painting featuring the Royal Family that you have ever seen is here, which makes for utterly compelling viewing. One particularly spooky portrait has eyes which seemed to follow you round the room. Unfortunately, it's of John Major. </p> <p><b> 11.20am:</b> National Gallery, Trafalgar Square. The National Gallery currently has a special exhibition selected by the children's illustrator Quentin Blake, which is better than it sounds: 26 illustrative works arranged in alphabetical order by artist's surname. After just 35 minutes I have to leave to get to my only pre-arranged appointment of the day - lunch. </p> <p><b> 12.30pm:</b> Tate Modern, Bankside. Roast cod and half a bottle of wine at a table overlooking the Thames. Does this count? Yes, I think so. Afterwards the Mondrians and Warhols whizz by in a pleasing blur. I sit for a few minutes watching an old silent film by Fernand L\u00e9ger, Le Ballet M\u00e9canique, in a stupor. What next? </p> <p><b> 3.10pm:</b> Green Park station. A defective train has halted service in both directions until nobody knows when. Note to tourists: do not attempt to use the London Underground. It's broken and at present there are no plans to fix it. </p> <p><b> 3.55pm:</b> Tate Britain, Millbank. Out of breath after my sprint from Green Park, I pay \u00a34.50 to watch Tacita Dean's exhibition of stately 16mm films, guessing there will be chairs. By now my back aches, my feet hurt and my eyes itch. One film in particular, a 44-minute excursion through an evening at a German revolving restaurant, turns out to be just my cup of tea. I could stay here all day. Not really. </p> <p><b> 5.40pm:</b> I arrive at the White Cube2 gallery for the new Tracy Emin show, 20 minutes before closing, queuing up before the open door of an outhouse to watch a video in which two Tracey Emins (hell's teeth!) argue about whether one is going to let the other into her flat. The bloke in front of me says: \"She's a very angry young lady.\" Idiot. </p> <p><b> 6.55pm:</b> Portland Place. Most galleries have a day when they open late, but it isn't Tuesday. I discover that the Royal Incorporation of British Architects has an exhibition about recent lottery-funded buildings, which is open until 9pm. I go to Great Portland Street instead and walk down Portland Place past legions of idle coppers, still there because of the May Day demonstrations. On arrival, a security guard informs me that the Riba building is closed. \"Because of this?\" I ask, indicating the silent, deserted streets all around us. He says yes. I give up. </p> <p><b> 7:45pm:</b> I arrive home exactly 12 hours after I set off, and spend 40 minutes staring at the painting above the television. Does that count? </p> <p><b> Cultural endurance: 12hrs, 00 mins </b><br></p> <p><b>Emma Brockes does television</b><br></p> <p> <b> 8.30am:</b> I have been training for this all my life: 12 uninterrupted hours of soaps, panel shows, phone-ins, Moira Stewart, a history of the U-boat, and that blissful slide into evening in the company of William G Stewart and the cast of Neighbours. Other people are arriving at work, but I am learning how to make a wrestling ring from a pizza container and some red insulation tape (Blue Peter repeat, BBC2). </p> <p>\"Video the Wombles for me,\" says my flatmate, choked with envy, and slams the outside door as I sink further into the sofa and assume a position I am confident of maintaining for the rest of the day. </p> <p><b> 9.30am: </b> Ricki Lake is just visible through the snow which passes for Channel 5's picture. I can't make out what she's saying. Nausea prickles through me as I deal with the fact that, if C5 dies, it blows Beachcomber Bay, Oprah, The Bold and the Beautiful and the Wonder Years out of my schedule. Grabbing the extension cord, I reel in the phone and place a panic call to my flatmate. \"Reception clears up as the day goes on,\" he says, relating the time he tried to watch Team Knight Rider on a Sunday morning, but could only comprehend half of it. It is a moment of unexpected pathos. </p> <p>I flick over to Kilroy for a discussion on \"sex and the over 50s\", where a woman is saying, \"We have it five times a week, but I know my husband would like me thinner.\" The day suddenly darkens. At 9.50am I sit up and am knocked flat by the blood rush. </p> <p><b> 10am: </b> Thank God, a double episode of ER. It's the one where Dr Carter leaves the surgical programme and Dr Green trashes the day room after being assaulted in the gents. At 10.08 a charge nurse turns to an exhausted Dr Benton and says: \"Why don't you go and take a shower?\" I get the weirdest sensation that my television is talking to me, but decide to wait for further signs before acting. Twenty minutes later, Jeannie, the nurse with HIV, turns to Dr Weaver. </p> <p>\"I'm not afraid,\" she says.<br><br>\"To die?\" says Dr Weaver.<br><br>\"To live,\" says Jeannie simply.<br><br>Inspired, I take a shower. My relationship with the television is definitely changing. </p> <p><b> 11.04am:</b> A woman rings the flat with a wrong number and I try to keep her talking. \"Richard doesn't live here, but maybe I can help?\" Does she think I'm a slob, I wonder, or someone vital to the machinery of capitalism who has been kept off work on account of the riots? I have grown a little insecure since noticing that all the adverts at this time of morning are for weight-loss products and debt relief. </p> <p>\"Please,\" I say. \"Don't go.\"<br><br>\"Sorry?\" she says.<br><br>\"I just, er, want to chat.\" </p> <p>The line goes dead and I am forced to return to Raj Persaud, who is steering a phone-in on bereavement entitled, \"get over it\". Competing with him for insights is an American psychologist named Rhonda. \"The night before my father killed my mother and then killed himself ...\" she begins. Persaud looks gutted. I am momentarily cheered. </p> <p><b> 1pm:</b> I haven't heard the sound of my own voice for hours. People walk purposefully past my window and I hate them, albeit listlessly. A children's programme called Songcatcher is on, in which a woman ambushes young children and makes them listen to her singing. \"Sandwiches, apples, biscuits, juice,\" she trills. \"Now, you sing.\" \"Sandwiches, apples, biscuits, juice,\" I chime. Then Floella Benjamin comes on in a blue jumpsuit. Only one thing can save me: satellite. </p> <p><b> 3pm: </b> My local TV shop can send an engineer around this afternoon. \"You mean, I could be watching old episodes of Neighbours on UK Gold by evening?\" I ask, scarcely daring to believe it. </p> <p>\"Sky will send you a card, yes, and you can be up and running in three days.\"<br><br>There is a short, hysterical pause.<br><br>\"You don't understand. I need it NOW.\" </p> <p>The telephonist laughs a little nervously. \"Of course, there are two channels you can access instantly.\" And they are? \"Sky News and the shopping channel.\" Is she mocking me? I hang up in despair. </p> <p><b> 4.30pm:</b> \"A nice ball of wool,\" the children's presenter soothes. I think I am loosing it. </p> <p><b> 9.10pm: </b> Ten fuscia crescents on the arm of the sofa, my fingernails. It is dark in here. The TV fluoresces in the corner. Talk, talk, talk, they never stop talking or wait for an answer or show any sign of acknowledging MY needs. I crave reality, but I can't remember where I put it. Huw Edwards is doing the news, pretending to ignore me. These people aren't my friends, I know that now. But when will the voices stop? When? </p> <p><b> Cultural endurance: 12 hours, 40 minutes </b><br> </p> <p><b> Stephen Moss does music</b><br> </p> <p> <b> 10am:</b> Sporting a stetson (for reasons which will become clear), I begin my musical odyssey in Covent Garden. London is empty and edgy, with the police and May Day protesters already camcordering each other. While other minds turn to anarchy, mine is focused on art. Unfortunately, the buskers who usually throng Covent Garden aren't in evidence so far. Valuable time is being lost. Worryingly, the opera house is boarded up, and St Martin's in the Fields has cancelled its 1pm organ recital. I hear the distant thrum of what I think is a bass guitar to the north of the piazza, and rush around to embrace the player. Unfortunately, it turns out to be an electrical generator on a building site; desperate, I listen for 15 minutes and pretend it's a piece of Stockhausen. </p> <p><b> Noon:</b> At last, action. The Sigma string quartet are playing in the well of the market. They whoop along to Bolero and the William Tell overture, and the audience loves them. A pleasurable, coffee-fuelled half an hour. </p> <p><b> 1pm:</b> Head for St James's Piccadilly in the hope that there might be a lunchtime recital, but no show. Just when I'm starting to despair, I hear celestial voices from the paved area in front of the church. A market trader and a middle-aged woman are singing songs from My Fair Lady to keep their spirits up. This counts, I tell myself, and I go over to encourage them to continue. The stall-holder turns out to be Malcolm Holland, who used to be in Edison Lighthouse (number one with Love Grows Where My Rosemary Goes in 1970, remember?). A God-given half an hour. </p> <p><b> 2pm: </b> Head back to Covent Garden. An all-female string trio called Oopsie Mamushka are now in residence in the market. The violinist spends much of her time lying on the floor, which does not improve bowing. Did Jascha Heifetz ever play while supine? I don't think so. The Sigmas are back at 2.30, so this is a highly successful hour, though I never want to hear Pachelbel's canon again. </p> <p><b> 3pm:</b> Cats in Drury Lane, playing to a small but enthusiastic house comprising elderly women, schoolgirls in neat uniforms, and Japanese tourists. Memory is wonderful, on all six occasions it is sung. Close to three hours, and suddenly I'm back in the game. </p> <p><b> 6pm: </b> But not for long. I was relying on having a meal in the Savoy's American bar while listening to the pianist, but my highly respectable pair of jeans are deemed inappropriate by some bloke in a bow-tie. Distressed, I head for Oxford Street to join the demo, stopping to take in 10 minutes of reggae (courtesy of a somnolent busker) in Leicester Square. </p> <p><b> 8pm: </b> Last chance saloon. The Borderline off Charing Cross Road (jeans more or less obligatory) for some Texan country-rock. This is why I wore the stetson, though I needn't have bothered as there's only one other cowboy hat in the house. What's wrong with these people? The excellent Slobberbone's lead singer looks like Neil Young - as do most of their middle-aged fans. Count two and a half hours, which includes lots of tuning up. </p> <p><b> 11pm: </b> Head for the Dublin Castle in Camden Town to catch the end of DJ Downfall, two young men playing drums, gongs and synthesisers to a small, spacey audience. I have no idea what genre this is - techno, trance, garage, slightly poky third bedroom - and find it difficult to assimilate. (The fact that I am drinking my sixth pint of Kronenbourg is not helping.) A young technophile at the bar assures me that the music's fine, but the venue is wrong. \"You want a place that stinks of poppers,\" he assures me gnomically. </p> <p><b> Midnight:</b> Take a cab back to Soho. A notice next to the driver says: \"Thank you for not smocking\", so I assume the cab is pretty old. Fifteenth century perhaps. I have heard less than nine hours of live music (not including the slow beat of the protesters' drums and the frenzied whirr of police helicopters), and my cause is looking lost. I settle into Ronnie Scott's for some late-night jazz and a steak sandwich. The sandwich is great; the music - an engaging saxophonist from Cameroon called Manu Dibango - a bit too sophisticated for my taste. I had assumed the jazz would go on until 3am, but the final set ends at 2.15. I make half-hearted efforts to find another venue, try out a few dodgy bars, refuse various offers of drugs, sex and battered minicabs, and get a black cab home just after 3am, weary, drunk and a little deflated. I have stopped at the musical equivalent of Tower Bridge, 105 minutes short of my 760-minute target. Next year, the Savoy had better watch out for an anarchist in a stetson intent on settling an old score. </p> <p><b> Cultural endurance: 10 hours, 55 minutes </b><br></p> <p><b>Merope Mills does films</b><br></p> <p><b> 11.45 am: </b> \"Don't be shy,\" says Annette in the box office, sensing that there are yet more questions ahead. We've been through it a dozen times but still I'm not quite sure. Can I squeeze in Traffic and The Hole? Could I handle both Spy Kids and Rugrats? For my 12 hours 40 minutes of planned cinema viewing putting together a feasible timetable is a job in itself. </p> <p>It has been hard to find an early morning billing - most cinemas don't start screening until early afternoon. In order to save valuable viewing time, I settle on spending the bulk of the day at UCI Whiteleys in Bayswater, west London. Popcorn and ice cream in hand it seems only sensible to start the session with some eye candy (Brad Pitt) in The Mexican (15).

      "bodyText": "Tim Dowling does art If you are going to do anything for 12 hours and 40 minutes, it seems sensible to get an early start. Standing at a bus stop at 7:45am, copy of Time Out in hand, I am determined to look at as much art as possible before the rush, if there is a rush. 8.55am: Piccadilly Pret a Manger. While not strictly an art gallery, Pret a Manger does at least have the distinction of being open at 8:55am. By common consent, virtually all galleries and museums open at 10am and shut at 6pm. My task has gone from uphill struggle to impossible mission in the space of an hour. Now I'm looking at a poster and drinking latte. Does this count? 9.30am: Agnew's Gallery, Old Bond Street. Agnew's is the only gallery in the West End which opens at 9.30, getting a half-hour jump on the competition. I push the buzzer, pull the door and find myself face to face with the tapestries of Louis Le Brocquy, \"Ireland's most important living artist\". A woman comes up the stairs and says, \"Can I help you?\" in a tone which unmistakably means: \"Please go away.\" She tells me the exhibit doesn't open until Thursday. I attempt to spin out this conversation for another 26 minutes, until the Royal Academy opens. It lasts a further 45 seconds. I am reduced to walking up and down Duke Street examining paintings of ships through security grilles. 10am: Royal Academy, Piccadilly. At last, some art. There are extra security guards laid on in anticipation of today's May Day riots, but my art lover disguise (rucksack, wind cheater, sensible shoes) fools them all. Tickets to see Botticelli's drawings for Dante's Divine Comedy cost \u00a37, but it's nice to be indoors. The Sackler wing has been divided into three galleries, Hell, Purgatory and Heaven, and the seven quid entitles me to headphones. I wander through Hell, listening to the commentary and congratulating myself for having never committed the sin of simony (the buying or selling of ecclesiastical pardons, offices, or emoluments). The drawings are beautiful, but most are quite small, and the lighting in the gallery is low. An elderly woman and I are almost cheek to cheek as we examine a tiny sketch of a devil farting. By the time I get to Heaven I am fast-forwarding through the commentary. The later drawings look a bit dashed off. Frankly, if Botticelli can't make the effort, neither can I. 10.50am: National Portrait Gallery, Charing Cross. Every horrible painting featuring the Royal Family that you have ever seen is here, which makes for utterly compelling viewing. One particularly spooky portrait has eyes which seemed to follow you round the room. Unfortunately, it's of John Major. 11.20am: National Gallery, Trafalgar Square. The National Gallery currently has a special exhibition selected by the children's illustrator Quentin Blake, which is better than it sounds: 26 illustrative works arranged in alphabetical order by artist's surname. After just 35 minutes I have to leave to get to my only pre-arranged appointment of the day - lunch. 12.30pm: Tate Modern, Bankside. Roast cod and half a bottle of wine at a table overlooking the Thames. Does this count? Yes, I think so. Afterwards the Mondrians and Warhols whizz by in a pleasing blur. I sit for a few minutes watching an old silent film by Fernand L\u00e9ger, Le Ballet M\u00e9canique, in a stupor. What next? 3.10pm: Green Park station. A defective train has halted service in both directions until nobody knows when. Note to tourists: do not attempt to use the London Underground. It's broken and at present there are no plans to fix it. 3.55pm: Tate Britain, Millbank. Out of breath after my sprint from Green Park, I pay \u00a34.50 to watch Tacita Dean's exhibition of stately 16mm films, guessing there will be chairs. By now my back aches, my feet hurt and my eyes itch. One film in particular, a 44-minute excursion through an evening at a German revolving restaurant, turns out to be just my cup of tea. I could stay here all day. Not really. 5.40pm: I arrive at the White Cube2 gallery for the new Tracy Emin show, 20 minutes before closing, queuing up before the open door of an outhouse to watch a video in which two Tracey Emins (hell's teeth!) argue about whether one is going to let the other into her flat. The bloke in front of me says: \"She's a very angry young lady.\" Idiot. 6.55pm: Portland Place. Most galleries have a day when they open late, but it isn't Tuesday. I discover that the Royal Incorporation of British Architects has an exhibition about recent lottery-funded buildings, which is open until 9pm. I go to Great Portland Street instead and walk down Portland Place past legions of idle coppers, still there because of the May Day demonstrations. On arrival, a security guard informs me that the Riba building is closed. \"Because of this?\" I ask, indicating the silent, deserted streets all around us. He says yes. I give up. 7:45pm: I arrive home exactly 12 hours after I set off, and spend 40 minutes staring at the painting above the television. Does that count? Cultural endurance: 12hrs, 00 mins Emma Brockes does television 8.30am: I have been training for this all my life: 12 uninterrupted hours of soaps, panel shows, phone-ins, Moira Stewart, a history of the U-boat, and that blissful slide into evening in the company of William G Stewart and the cast of Neighbours. Other people are arriving at work, but I am learning how to make a wrestling ring from a pizza container and some red insulation tape (Blue Peter repeat, BBC2). \"Video the Wombles for me,\" says my flatmate, choked with envy, and slams the outside door as I sink further into the sofa and assume a position I am confident of maintaining for the rest of the day. 9.30am: Ricki Lake is just visible through the snow which passes for Channel 5's picture. I can't make out what she's saying. Nausea prickles through me as I deal with the fact that, if C5 dies, it blows Beachcomber Bay, Oprah, The Bold and the Beautiful and the Wonder Years out of my schedule. Grabbing the extension cord, I reel in the phone and place a panic call to my flatmate. \"Reception clears up as the day goes on,\" he says, relating the time he tried to watch Team Knight Rider on a Sunday morning, but could only comprehend half of it. It is a moment of unexpected pathos. I flick over to Kilroy for a discussion on \"sex and the over 50s\", where a woman is saying, \"We have it five times a week, but I know my husband would like me thinner.\" The day suddenly darkens. At 9.50am I sit up and am knocked flat by the blood rush. 10am: Thank God, a double episode of ER. It's the one where Dr Carter leaves the surgical programme and Dr Green trashes the day room after being assaulted in the gents. At 10.08 a charge nurse turns to an exhausted Dr Benton and says: \"Why don't you go and take a shower?\" I get the weirdest sensation that my television is talking to me, but decide to wait for further signs before acting. Twenty minutes later, Jeannie, the nurse with HIV, turns to Dr Weaver. \"I'm not afraid,\" she says. \"To die?\" says Dr Weaver. \"To live,\" says Jeannie simply. Inspired, I take a shower. My relationship with the television is definitely changing. 11.04am: A woman rings the flat with a wrong number and I try to keep her talking. \"Richard doesn't live here, but maybe I can help?\" Does she think I'm a slob, I wonder, or someone vital to the machinery of capitalism who has been kept off work on account of the riots? I have grown a little insecure since noticing that all the adverts at this time of morning are for weight-loss products and debt relief. \"Please,\" I say. \"Don't go.\" \"Sorry?\" she says. \"I just, er, want to chat.\" The line goes dead and I am forced to return to Raj Persaud, who is steering a phone-in on bereavement entitled, \"get over it\". Competing with him for insights is an American psychologist named Rhonda. \"The night before my father killed my mother and then killed himself ...\" she begins. Persaud looks gutted. I am momentarily cheered. 1pm: I haven't heard the sound of my own voice for hours. People walk purposefully past my window and I hate them, albeit listlessly. A children's programme called Songcatcher is on, in which a woman ambushes young children and makes them listen to her singing. \"Sandwiches, apples, biscuits, juice,\" she trills. \"Now, you sing.\" \"Sandwiches, apples, biscuits, juice,\" I chime. Then Floella Benjamin comes on in a blue jumpsuit. Only one thing can save me: satellite. 3pm: My local TV shop can send an engineer around this afternoon. \"You mean, I could be watching old episodes of Neighbours on UK Gold by evening?\" I ask, scarcely daring to believe it. \"Sky will send you a card, yes, and you can be up and running in three days.\" There is a short, hysterical pause. \"You don't understand. I need it NOW.\" The telephonist laughs a little nervously. \"Of course, there are two channels you can access instantly.\" And they are? \"Sky News and the shopping channel.\" Is she mocking me? I hang up in despair. 4.30pm: \"A nice ball of wool,\" the children's presenter soothes. I think I am loosing it. 9.10pm: Ten fuscia crescents on the arm of the sofa, my fingernails. It is dark in here. The TV fluoresces in the corner. Talk, talk, talk, they never stop talking or wait for an answer or show any sign of acknowledging MY needs. I crave reality, but I can't remember where I put it. Huw Edwards is doing the news, pretending to ignore me. These people aren't my friends, I know that now. But when will the voices stop? When? Cultural endurance: 12 hours, 40 minutes Stephen Moss does music 10am: Sporting a stetson (for reasons which will become clear), I begin my musical odyssey in Covent Garden. London is empty and edgy, with the police and May Day protesters already camcordering each other. While other minds turn to anarchy, mine is focused on art. Unfortunately, the buskers who usually throng Covent Garden aren't in evidence so far. Valuable time is being lost. Worryingly, the opera house is boarded up, and St Martin's in the Fields has cancelled its 1pm organ recital. I hear the distant thrum of what I think is a bass guitar to the north of the piazza, and rush around to embrace the player. Unfortunately, it turns out to be an electrical generator on a building site; desperate, I listen for 15 minutes and pretend it's a piece of Stockhausen. Noon: At last, action. The Sigma string quartet are playing in the well of the market. They whoop along to Bolero and the William Tell overture, and the audience loves them. A pleasurable, coffee-fuelled half an hour. 1pm: Head for St James's Piccadilly in the hope that there might be a lunchtime recital, but no show. Just when I'm starting to despair, I hear celestial voices from the paved area in front of the church. A market trader and a middle-aged woman are singing songs from My Fair Lady to keep their spirits up. This counts, I tell myself, and I go over to encourage them to continue. The stall-holder turns out to be Malcolm Holland, who used to be in Edison Lighthouse (number one with Love Grows Where My Rosemary Goes in 1970, remember?). A God-given half an hour. 2pm: Head back to Covent Garden. An all-female string trio called Oopsie Mamushka are now in residence in the market. The violinist spends much of her time lying on the floor, which does not improve bowing. Did Jascha Heifetz ever play while supine? I don't think so. The Sigmas are back at 2.30, so this is a highly successful hour, though I never want to hear Pachelbel's canon again. 3pm: Cats in Drury Lane, playing to a small but enthusiastic house comprising elderly women, schoolgirls in neat uniforms, and Japanese tourists. Memory is wonderful, on all six occasions it is sung. Close to three hours, and suddenly I'm back in the game. 6pm: But not for long. I was relying on having a meal in the Savoy's American bar while listening to the pianist, but my highly respectable pair of jeans are deemed inappropriate by some bloke in a bow-tie. Distressed, I head for Oxford Street to join the demo, stopping to take in 10 minutes of reggae (courtesy of a somnolent busker) in Leicester Square. 8pm: Last chance saloon. The Borderline off Charing Cross Road (jeans more or less obligatory) for some Texan country-rock. This is why I wore the stetson, though I needn't have bothered as there's only one other cowboy hat in the house. What's wrong with these people? The excellent Slobberbone's lead singer looks like Neil Young - as do most of their middle-aged fans. Count two and a half hours, which includes lots of tuning up. 11pm: Head for the Dublin Castle in Camden Town to catch the end of DJ Downfall, two young men playing drums, gongs and synthesisers to a small, spacey audience. I have no idea what genre this is - techno, trance, garage, slightly poky third bedroom - and find it difficult to assimilate. (The fact that I am drinking my sixth pint of Kronenbourg is not helping.) A young technophile at the bar assures me that the music's fine, but the venue is wrong. \"You want a place that stinks of poppers,\" he assures me gnomically. Midnight: Take a cab back to Soho. A notice next to the driver says: \"Thank you for not smocking\", so I assume the cab is pretty old. Fifteenth century perhaps. I have heard less than nine hours of live music (not including the slow beat of the protesters' drums and the frenzied whirr of police helicopters), and my cause is looking lost. I settle into Ronnie Scott's for some late-night jazz and a steak sandwich. The sandwich is great; the music - an engaging saxophonist from Cameroon called Manu Dibango - a bit too sophisticated for my taste. I had assumed the jazz would go on until 3am, but the final set ends at 2.15. I make half-hearted efforts to find another venue, try out a few dodgy bars, refuse various offers of drugs, sex and battered minicabs, and get a black cab home just after 3am, weary, drunk and a little deflated. I have stopped at the musical equivalent of Tower Bridge, 105 minutes short of my 760-minute target. Next year, the Savoy had better watch out for an anarchist in a stetson intent on settling an old score. Cultural endurance: 10 hours, 55 minutes Merope Mills does films 11.45 am: \"Don't be shy,\" says Annette in the box office, sensing that there are yet more questions ahead. We've been through it a dozen times but still I'm not quite sure. Can I squeeze in Traffic and The Hole? Could I handle both Spy Kids and Rugrats? For my 12 hours 40 minutes of planned cinema viewing putting together a feasible timetable is a job in itself. It has been hard to find an early morning billing - most cinemas don't start screening until early afternoon. In order to save valuable viewing time, I settle on spending the bulk of the day at UCI Whiteleys in Bayswater, west London. Popcorn and ice cream in hand it seems only sensible to start the session with some eye candy (Brad Pitt) in The Mexican (15). Annette has come to the conclusion that I am some sort of irrepressible film buff with no friends and proffers a leaflet. \"It's our ladies' night,\" she says. \"Every Wednesday for \u00a32.\" I thank her and vow never to set foot in this cinema again. 2.40pm: Post-The Mexican and still feeling fine. A timetable overlap means I am running late for Rugrats In Paris: The Movie (U). No great loss, but I make a mental note to save time by buying in bulk. Dennis is now manning the box office and seems bemused by my request for two tickets - one to Rugrats and one to Bridget Jones. \"You're going to watch both films?\" he asks. \"You must be in a movie mood today.\" I spend the next hour wondering at the storyline of some animated babies traversing Paris with the help of a giant reptile and pleading that, next time, the overly amorous couple on my left will get a room rather than a U-rated cinema ticket. 4.30pm: One hour into Bridget Jones' Diary (15): Number of mobile phone rings interrupting shows so far: four (v bad). Number of times have repositioned self in uncomfortable seats in last five minutes: 23 (dreadful). Cinema head count increasing through out the day. Conclude that most of audience is composed of sad singletons and spend rest of film wondering why said singletons have not got jobs to go to.

There is quite enough money in football to pay for it, with clubs like Manchester United and Arsenal Inc becoming some of the biggest businesses in Europe.

But consider the facts: it took Nintendo 10 years to sell 100m Game Boys whereas Nokia sold 128m handsets last year alone. And then look around the train carriage and see for yourself how many fingers are twiddling across phones that are otherwise not in use. </p> <p>The amazing rise of the handset as a gaming device has got the video games industry in a flap. As recently as 1998 the notion of gaming on a phone had never occurred. By last week it was a big enough deal to warrant its own exhibition and conference. </p> <p>Mobile Entertainment 2001, in Paris, was a fascinating showcase for this embryonic industry. The first thing that struck, however, was just how different it is from the \"conventional\" games business. There was no razzmatazz here. It is hard to justify pole dancers and Ferraris when your roster of games includes draughts and hangman. </p> <p>But it is the simplicity of the \"products\" that has got everyone so excited. They appeal to everyone. Around 40m people in the UK now own a mobile and that means women, the over 40s, teenage girls - all those groups that conventional video games cannot reach. </p> <p>At present the size, grey colours and graphical resolution of handsets, limit what can be done technically. But there are social restrictions to bear in mind, too. A good mobile game should be dipped into for five minutes at a time. It should also have a community element. </p> <p>Chris Wright, business development manager of the Scottish mobile games company Digital Bridges, sums it up: \"Wireless games should be competing with the crossword, not Quake. People will never sit for hours playing a game on a phone,\" he says. </p> <p>Which is why the games on demonstration at Mobile Entertainment 2001 included simple golf simulations, football management, parlour games and quizzes. The latter proved the most interesting with Finland's Codeonline, one of many Nordic developers attending, previewing Who Wants To Be A Million aire? and Trivial Pursuit. Millionaire? has already been launched in Finland and will appear on a small screen near you later in the year. </p> <p>It is easy to see why these major brands would want to hijack the handset. It gives fans a chance to buy into the phenomenon, form communities around them and thereby prolong their appeal. Indeed Riot-E, another Nordic studio, has already signed the mobile rights to Marvel and even Bridget Jones's Diary. </p> <p>The community element in these games is critical. Crushed by 3G debt, the phone companies know that handset entertainment will only make them money if it involves sending data. Solo Snake does not earn anyone cash. Playing two-player hangman or post ing Millionaire high scores in an SMS does. </p> <p>The French developer In Fusio is already bagging healthy sums this way. It embedded simple puzzle games on France Telecom handsets and invited users to play them offline and then compete for prizes by posting their progress in an SMS competition that costs 10p. Hundreds of thousands regularly do. </p> <p>More typically, however, the networks simply host games (if you have a Wap connection, go to games on the screen menu) and tempt users to play them online. And as technologies such as general packet radio service (GPRS) improve data transfer rates, the hope is that games will move on to full colour action. </p> <p>In the meantime, we can look forward to the first Star Trek game on a mobile. Star Trek First Duty will be launched later in the summer, an important release even if it does show that this new market can't quite shake off its nerdy roots. There has already been a request to translate the game into Klingon.</p>",

The latter proved the most interesting with Finland's Codeonline, one of many Nordic developers attending, previewing Who Wants To Be A Million aire? and Trivial Pursuit. Millionaire? has already been launched in Finland and will appear on a small screen near you later in the year. It is easy to see why these major brands would want to hijack the handset. It gives fans a chance to buy into the phenomenon, form communities around them and thereby prolong their appeal. Indeed Riot-E, another Nordic studio, has already signed the mobile rights to Marvel and even Bridget Jones's Diary. The community element in these games is critical. Crushed by 3G debt, the phone companies know that handset entertainment will only make them money if it involves sending data. Solo Snake does not earn anyone cash. Playing two-player hangman or post ing Millionaire high scores in an SMS does. The French developer In Fusio is already bagging healthy sums this way. It embedded simple puzzle games on France Telecom handsets and invited users to play them offline and then compete for prizes by posting their progress in an SMS competition that costs 10p. Hundreds of thousands regularly do. More typically, however, the networks simply host games (if you have a Wap connection, go to games on the screen menu) and tempt users to play them online. And as technologies such as general packet radio service (GPRS) improve data transfer rates, the hope is that games will move on to full colour action. In the meantime, we can look forward to the first Star Trek game on a mobile. Star Trek First Duty will be launched later in the summer, an important release even if it does show that this new market can't quite shake off its nerdy roots. There has already been a request to translate the game into Klingon.",

What most people do not understand is why anyone should want to be a vegan - vegetarianism is quite enough halo-polishing for one mortal. The reason it is not obvious is to do with the way in which food production has been removed from our everyday lives. The simple fact is that if you believe killing animals is wrong, then vegetarians are hypocritical - for instance, to get milk from a cow, she has to have a calf a year. This involves lots of hormones and arguably a bit of cruelty, but the point is, those baby cows then end up as veal. Even if they were kept and used as dairy cows themselves (which is unlikely in a non-organic farm), half will be males and they are just no use.

      "bodyText": "Extra ice The Titanic Deckchair Rearrangement Corporation (TDCRC) has launched a new corporate website at www.tdcrc.com, which means Chris Locke has another book to flog. In this case it is Gonzo Marketing: Winning Through Worst Practices, which is due out in October. However, for those who missed The Cluetrain Manifesto or are too humour-challenged to read Entropy Gradient Reversals, the first chapter is available online at http://205.178.173.189/gonzomarkets.com. Plane risky What are your chances of surviving your next flight? Every air traveller wants to know the odds, and nobody is willing or able to say. However, you can get a good idea from the UK-based website at www.amigoingdown.com. Its calculations are based on published information such as the airline, the type of plane, the time of the flight, and so on. Since the odds are very small, the site can even be recommended to fearful flyers. Webbies feat Well done, the BBC. The nominations for the fifth annual Webby Awards have just been announced, and BBC websites have been nominated in two categories: News (http://news.bbc.co.uk) and Radio (www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice). Other notable nominees include Fucked Company, Gamasutra and a lot of familiar old favourites. Unfortunately, thanks to a bizarre bit of bloated programming, the web addresses for the various contenders do not link to their sites, only to the Webbies page www.webbyawards.com/nominees. Nominations for two more categories, arts and technical achievement, will be announced on June 20, and the awards will be presented on July 18. Voting for the People's Voice winners should be open now. Swamped Which new website attracted more than 26m visitors in its first 54 hours online - and might have had many more if it had not been swamped? It was nothing pornographic, political or even pontifical. It was, in fact, the Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation's site. Ellis Island has the arrival records of 22m immigrants who entered the port of New York between 1892 and 1924. If your ancestors came or went that way, the site at www.ellisislandrecords.org should have the details. Brain power In the early 80s, an outliner or \"ideas processor\" called Brainstorm attracted some attention. Now it has returned in a free trial version for Microsoft Windows, which can be downloaded from www.brainstormsw.com. In between, the program has been \"Tebbo's mysterious hobby\", David Tebbutt having been one of the people who helped popularise microcomputing in the UK. He says: \"Apart from its original purpose, which was to enable high-speed thinking, planning and organising, it can now be used to publish 3D web pages of your thoughts and to blend the work of teams together.\" Sight test Politicians are notorious for their inability to understand or use the internet.

      "body": "<p><strong> Is the UK holding its own in terms of technology and innovation?</strong> Teaching kids about invention should be part of the national curriculum. I went to Hoover years ago and suggested they place an ioniser in the back of a vacuum cleaner but they did not even pay me the courtesy of a reply. This made me realise how many inventors are facing that same indifference. Before, if I said I was an inventor, people would look at me like I had a disease, yet artists and designers are never questioned.

      "body": "<p>We all love our gadgets, but you can have too much of a good thing. Once you are packing a mobile phone, an electronic organiser, an MP3 music player and a digital tape recorder, it is hard to find pockets or purse-room for the electronic book, the Game Boy, the digital camera, the portable radio, the pocket calculator, the satellite positioning system and the handy translator that lets you type in an English word and look up the Russian equivalent. </p> <p>Do not worry, the consumer electronics giants have a solution: combine half a dozen gadgets into a single device. This idea is seen as the salvation of the mobile phone industry, which is suffering from a slump in handset sales. (Ericsson and Motorola are closing factories, while Siemens is shedding staff.) </p> <p>It is also seen as prime territory by computer industry giants such as Compaq and Hewlett-Packard, which are looking for new markets as growth slows in the PC sector. </p> <p>Adding extra functions could give many people the incentive to buy a new mobile phone or handheld computer. And the ultimate PDA (personal digital assistant) will do just about anything. It will handle both voice and data calls, send SMS text messages, and access the internet to collect email and faxes and surf the web. It will have a built-in electronic book reader, an MP3 player and it will play games. It will keep track of where you are, using location services and on-screen street maps. </p> <p>In the future, you may well use it not just to keep track of your spending, but to pay for things via its \"electronic wallet\" facility. And if your PDA-phone on steroids does not have a built-in camera, you will be able to plug one in, either to take snapshots or to use for videoconferencing. </p> <p>We are not there yet, but we are getting close. Mark Squires, Nokia's business development manager, says his new Nokia 9210 Communicator phone can already do most of those things, \"and I haven't even started to load software on it yet\". </p> <p>The Compaq iPaq and HP Jornada palmtop computers are also being sold as multifunction devices. The built-in software includes pocket versions of Microsoft Word, Excel, Internet Explorer and Money, and users who buy Microsoft's Autoroute package can load Pocket Streets. </p> <p>These PocketPCs also include an electronic book reader, a voice recording facility and a Windows Media Audio player as standard. What they do not have is built-in mobile phone communications, but that is the sort of thing that could be added via a plug-in module. The VisorPhone, which plugs into a Handspring palmtop running Palm OS, is one example. </p> <p>The resulting competition should be good for consumers: all sorts of gizmos will be competing for the space in your pocket, and the pound in your pocket. (More likely several hundred pounds.) But it may also create a lot of confusion. </p> <p>Of course, everyone agrees the future will be mobile and wireless. However, there are broad battle lines being drawn between two camps. On one side are the voice-centric products, such as mobile phones. On the other are data-centric devices, such as PDAs. But both will have similar functions, and may well use the same software. The leading candidates include Palm OS, Symbian's version of Epoc, spun out of Psion, and Microsoft's PocketPC. Some suppliers are also expected to use mobile versions of GNU/Linux, the free \"open source\" clone of the Unix operating system. </p> <p>Ultimately, many people expect the market to \"shake down\", as Squires puts it, to a small number of devices. The biggest, heaviest and probably the most expensive will be \"clamshell\" devices with built-in keyboards and screens, such as the Psion-based Nokia 9210 Communicator and Hewlett-Packard Jornada 720, which runs Microsoft Windows CE (originally, Consumer Electronics). Screen resolution should be about 640 by 240 pixels: half a PC's standard VGA screen. </p> <p>These devices appeal to people who really need to enter data on the move, not just look up information downloaded from a PC or the web. </p> <p>The next class will be multimedia devices that replace the keyboard with handwrit ing recognition on a touch-sensitive screen, which should be at least quarter-VGA (320 by 240 pixels). You will not hold these devices up to your ear to make phone calls - that makes it hard to see the screen - but use an earpiece instead. So far, this category is populated mostly by \"concept phones\" and reference devices such as Symbian's Quartz. However, PocketPC-based phones such as the Sagem and Trium Mondo, and the Handspring VisorPhone, come close. </p> <p>The third category is the \"smart phone\". This is basically a smaller and lighter version of the multimedia device but in the shape of a conventional mobile phone. The screen will be about half the size (and less than half the price), but could have the same resolution. The smart phone uses a numeric keypad instead of handwriting recognition.

      "bodyText": "We all love our gadgets, but you can have too much of a good thing. Once you are packing a mobile phone, an electronic organiser, an MP3 music player and a digital tape recorder, it is hard to find pockets or purse-room for the electronic book, the Game Boy, the digital camera, the portable radio, the pocket calculator, the satellite positioning system and the handy translator that lets you type in an English word and look up the Russian equivalent. Do not worry, the consumer electronics giants have a solution: combine half a dozen gadgets into a single device. This idea is seen as the salvation of the mobile phone industry, which is suffering from a slump in handset sales. (Ericsson and Motorola are closing factories, while Siemens is shedding staff.) It is also seen as prime territory by computer industry giants such as Compaq and Hewlett-Packard, which are looking for new markets as growth slows in the PC sector. Adding extra functions could give many people the incentive to buy a new mobile phone or handheld computer. And the ultimate PDA (personal digital assistant) will do just about anything. It will handle both voice and data calls, send SMS text messages, and access the internet to collect email and faxes and surf the web. It will have a built-in electronic book reader, an MP3 player and it will play games. It will keep track of where you are, using location services and on-screen street maps. In the future, you may well use it not just to keep track of your spending, but to pay for things via its \"electronic wallet\" facility. And if your PDA-phone on steroids does not have a built-in camera, you will be able to plug one in, either to take snapshots or to use for videoconferencing. We are not there yet, but we are getting close. Mark Squires, Nokia's business development manager, says his new Nokia 9210 Communicator phone can already do most of those things, \"and I haven't even started to load software on it yet\". The Compaq iPaq and HP Jornada palmtop computers are also being sold as multifunction devices. The built-in software includes pocket versions of Microsoft Word, Excel, Internet Explorer and Money, and users who buy Microsoft's Autoroute package can load Pocket Streets. These PocketPCs also include an electronic book reader, a voice recording facility and a Windows Media Audio player as standard. What they do not have is built-in mobile phone communications, but that is the sort of thing that could be added via a plug-in module. The VisorPhone, which plugs into a Handspring palmtop running Palm OS, is one example. The resulting competition should be good for consumers: all sorts of gizmos will be competing for the space in your pocket, and the pound in your pocket. (More likely several hundred pounds.) But it may also create a lot of confusion. Of course, everyone agrees the future will be mobile and wireless. However, there are broad battle lines being drawn between two camps. On one side are the voice-centric products, such as mobile phones. On the other are data-centric devices, such as PDAs. But both will have similar functions, and may well use the same software. The leading candidates include Palm OS, Symbian's version of Epoc, spun out of Psion, and Microsoft's PocketPC. Some suppliers are also expected to use mobile versions of GNU/Linux, the free \"open source\" clone of the Unix operating system. Ultimately, many people expect the market to \"shake down\", as Squires puts it, to a small number of devices. The biggest, heaviest and probably the most expensive will be \"clamshell\" devices with built-in keyboards and screens, such as the Psion-based Nokia 9210 Communicator and Hewlett-Packard Jornada 720, which runs Microsoft Windows CE (originally, Consumer Electronics). Screen resolution should be about 640 by 240 pixels: half a PC's standard VGA screen. These devices appeal to people who really need to enter data on the move, not just look up information downloaded from a PC or the web. The next class will be multimedia devices that replace the keyboard with handwrit ing recognition on a touch-sensitive screen, which should be at least quarter-VGA (320 by 240 pixels). You will not hold these devices up to your ear to make phone calls - that makes it hard to see the screen - but use an earpiece instead. So far, this category is populated mostly by \"concept phones\" and reference devices such as Symbian's Quartz. However, PocketPC-based phones such as the Sagem and Trium Mondo, and the Handspring VisorPhone, come close. The third category is the \"smart phone\". This is basically a smaller and lighter version of the multimedia device but in the shape of a conventional mobile phone. The screen will be about half the size (and less than half the price), but could have the same resolution. The smart phone uses a numeric keypad instead of handwriting recognition. Examples include the Ericsson R520, and a string of forthcoming devices based on Microsoft's Stinger reference phone, such as the Sendo 100. The smallest, lightest and cheapest device is the ordinary mobile phone, but it will become increasingly less ordinary. Steve Walker, Ericsson's marketing and new business director for consumer products, says: \"There will always be an entry level segment, but what's included in that will increase as the cost of implementation falls.\" Walker points out that most phones can now handle Wap (wireless application protocol) for limited internet access, as well as text messaging.

Suddenly she started thinking about essays and texting. Ten minutes later her poem was finished. She will count herself fortunate if she earns so much money so quickly again. </p> <p>Hetty's favourite poet is Alice Walker, but she also likes Maya Angelou. Among her other interests are music, reading and development studies. She sheepishly admitted she had given her entry 10 out of 10 when it was texted back to her as part of the interactive side of the competition, but added that she had marked the other six on the short list fairly generously from 6.5 to 9.0. </p> <p>The second prize of \u00a3500 went to Steve Kilgallon, aged 22, who was promoted last week to be the sports editor of the Wigan Observer. A graduate of St Anne's College, Oxford ,where he read English and modern history, he is writing a history of rugby league at Oxford and Cambridge. He played rugby league while at Oxford and was watching a league game when told he had won second prize. </p> <p>Kilgallon was born in Leeds and now lives in Manchester. He says the idea for the poem occurred to him the day before he learned about the competition while driving in Sheffield on his way back from Leeds. He doesn't write poems and only sent in one entry. </p> <p>There were three third prizes of \u00a3100. One goes to Charlotte Fortune, a 26-year-old former archaeology student at Liverpool university, who now works part-time in bars. The second goes to Melissa Terras, of Christchurch College, Oxford, who, amazingly, managed to get two of her three poems on to our shortlist of seven. Marissa is doing a doctorate in engineering and classics, part of which involves using computers to read old documents. She already has an MSc in computing and humanities in addition to two other degrees. </p> <p>The final prize of \u00a3100 goes to Carole Bromley of York, a teacher doing an M Phil in writing at the University of Glamorgan. She is the only regular poet among the winners and was runner-up in this year's BT Stay in Touch competition, part of the Poetry Society's annual competition. </p> <p>She said that doing the text competition had been \"the most exciting thing\", adding: \"It was such a different medium watching all the numbers coming down.
