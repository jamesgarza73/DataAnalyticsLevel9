Under conductor David Parry, the cast (led by Rita Cullis as Creusa) have clearly worked hard in difficult circumstances, but their words are rarely audible (the opening invocation by Hermes, boldly sung by Garry Magee, is an exception), while the music, always unfolding at the same deadening pace, rarely delivers any striking theatrical ideas and never points up either the wit of the text or the lyricism that is implied. </p> <p>There are brassy, Tippett-like volleys to open, but the rest is mostly long stretches of Brittenish word-setting underpinned with delicately coloured chords indebted to Messiaen. Some of it is very spare indeed, and in the circumstances it is natural to wonder whether this is intended as the final version, or is just a preliminary sketch of what might be if and when the score is finished.

There are brassy, Tippett-like volleys to open, but the rest is mostly long stretches of Brittenish word-setting underpinned with delicately coloured chords indebted to Messiaen. Some of it is very spare indeed, and in the circumstances it is natural to wonder whether this is intended as the final version, or is just a preliminary sketch of what might be if and when the score is finished. It is difficult to believe, though, that the missing music will provide the dramatic impetus that is so clearly wanting. \u0095 Performances at the Almeida, London, on June 23, 24, 26, 28 and July 1 (Box office: 020 7359 4404).",

But dealers warned that talk of prices falling by 30% to 40% was \"fantasy land\". </p> <p>The greatest row, however, is brewing behind the scenes with manufacturers based both in the UK and mainland Europe warning that Mr Byers was effectively forcing them to pay double commission, and hence producing a scheme that was unworkable. </p> <p>Under present EU rules, authorised British dealers are free to import cheaper cars from a fellow dealer in mainland Europe but are deterred from doing so as such cars do not count towards their sales target or sales bonus. </p> <p>But the trade secretary, who is seen within the industry as milking a new populist bandwagon now his reputation has recovered from the Rover debacle, proposed ending that anomaly in a series of measures to implement the competition commission's April report on car pricing. </p> <p>One insider said: \"We warned him on Friday that it wouldn't work, and he should remove it and he hasn't. His plan could mean that we pay double commission and that could mean at worst there would be no incentive for a dealer to sell any cars. There will be a big fight on this.\" </p> <p>Mr Byers, who has spearheaded a campaign to end the so-called rip-off Britain, has given the industry 30 days to consult on his plans which include, as expected, measures to enable dealers to offer the same discounts to individual customers as they now offer to fleet buyers. But even here, industry sources said, he faces a bitter fight over definitions. </p> <p>Mr Byers' unexpected move prompted Sheila McKechnie, head of the Consumers' Association, to talk of a huge leap in buying from overseas and to look forward to even bigger changes from next year when the EU changes the block exemption rules allowing manufacturers to control prices. The CA has set up its own scheme to allow consumers to buy cheaper European models. </p> <p>Edmund King, executive director of the RAC Foundation, the body's campaigning arm, said prices had already fallen by 6% in recent months. </p> <p><strong>10-year war to trim prices</strong></p> <p>There have been numerous investigations into new car prices by competition authorities and MPs. </p> <p>These include: <br> \u0095 <strong> Monopolies commission</strong> inquiry in 1990-91. Report published in 1992. </p> <p>\u0095<strong> European commission </strong> report on car price differentials, published in May 1992 and car price surveys every six months since May 1993. </p> <p>\u0095 Commons <strong> trade and industry select committee</strong> investigation and report on vehicle pricing in 1998. </p> <p>\u0095 <strong> Competition commission </strong> inquiry began in February 1999, resulting in a 738-page report published in April this year. </p> <p>The industry has had to review sales and distribution practices after an EC threat to abolish the agreement which exempts carmakers from some competition regulations. </p> <p>The agreement, known as the block exemption, runs out in September 2002. It allows carmakers to maintain networks of exclusive franchised dealers. Competition commissioner Mario Monti is unsympathetic to carmakers' pleas for its renewal. </p>",

      "bodyText": "The government yesterday stirred up a hornet's nest with global motor manufacturers when it said UK dealers could import cheaper cars via authorised colleagues in the European Union as part of the drive to bring down the cost to consumers by at least 10%, or \u00a31,100 a vehicle. Trade and industry secretary Stephen Byers - thought to have sprung this move on the manufacturers last Friday - said the measure would bring greater competition and lower prices by stopping suppliers discriminating against dealers. Consumer bodies hailed Mr Byers' move to make it easier for consumers to import cars from elsewhere in the EU - as much as 12% cheaper - as going beyond their wildest dreams. But dealers warned that talk of prices falling by 30% to 40% was \"fantasy land\". The greatest row, however, is brewing behind the scenes with manufacturers based both in the UK and mainland Europe warning that Mr Byers was effectively forcing them to pay double commission, and hence producing a scheme that was unworkable. Under present EU rules, authorised British dealers are free to import cheaper cars from a fellow dealer in mainland Europe but are deterred from doing so as such cars do not count towards their sales target or sales bonus. But the trade secretary, who is seen within the industry as milking a new populist bandwagon now his reputation has recovered from the Rover debacle, proposed ending that anomaly in a series of measures to implement the competition commission's April report on car pricing. One insider said: \"We warned him on Friday that it wouldn't work, and he should remove it and he hasn't. His plan could mean that we pay double commission and that could mean at worst there would be no incentive for a dealer to sell any cars. There will be a big fight on this.\" Mr Byers, who has spearheaded a campaign to end the so-called rip-off Britain, has given the industry 30 days to consult on his plans which include, as expected, measures to enable dealers to offer the same discounts to individual customers as they now offer to fleet buyers. But even here, industry sources said, he faces a bitter fight over definitions. Mr Byers' unexpected move prompted Sheila McKechnie, head of the Consumers' Association, to talk of a huge leap in buying from overseas and to look forward to even bigger changes from next year when the EU changes the block exemption rules allowing manufacturers to control prices. The CA has set up its own scheme to allow consumers to buy cheaper European models. Edmund King, executive director of the RAC Foundation, the body's campaigning arm, said prices had already fallen by 6% in recent months. 10-year war to trim prices There have been numerous investigations into new car prices by competition authorities and MPs. These include: \u0095 Monopolies commission inquiry in 1990-91. Report published in 1992. \u0095 European commission report on car price differentials, published in May 1992 and car price surveys every six months since May 1993. \u0095 Commons trade and industry select committee investigation and report on vehicle pricing in 1998. \u0095 Competition commission inquiry began in February 1999, resulting in a 738-page report published in April this year. The industry has had to review sales and distribution practices after an EC threat to abolish the agreement which exempts carmakers from some competition regulations. The agreement, known as the block exemption, runs out in September 2002. It allows carmakers to maintain networks of exclusive franchised dealers. Competition commissioner Mario Monti is unsympathetic to carmakers' pleas for its renewal.",

At last, Euro 2000 was the stage for players who could transfer the ball accurately over a variety of distances and think two, three or even four passes ahead. </p> <p>And then came Holland, whose players have the capacity to produce more diverse football than any in the competition. In theory, all they need to do to win the competition is to make common cause with each other for the next three weeks. On the evidence of last night's match, Frank Rijkaard's first competitive game as manager, it may well be beyond them, unless they can continue such slices of luck as the one represented by Pierluigi Collina's award of a penalty for Jiri Nemec's challenge on Ronald de Boer. </p> <p>As expected, Rijkaard sent his side out in a straightforward 4-4-2 formation with Dennis Bergkamp in his favourite role of shadow striker, just behind Patrick Kluivert. Whenever Edgar Davids was pulling the strings from his normal station in central midfield, Holland looked dangerous. But Kluivert and Bergkamp were receiving harsh treatment from the Czech defence and the chances were few, with Pavel Srnicek making sprawling saves to deny Kluivert twice in the first quarter of an hour. </p> <p>Four years ago the Czechs were the surprise package of Euro 96, reaching the fi nal by beating France on penalties in the semi-final before taking Germany all the way to extra time. Unbeaten in their qualifying matches for this year's tournament, they are nobody's dark horses now. </p> <p>But their methods in the first half last night were not calculated to divert a neutral's affection away from the men in orange. With one extremely big man, Karel Rada, at the back and another, Jan Koller, up front, they relied on a posse of scurrying midfield players to make rapid breaks and to put themselves in the way of the Dutch as soon as possession was lost. </p> <p>By half-time they must have felt they were succeeding. Although they had mustered only a single shot, when Pavel Nedved lashed a 30-yard drive into the side netting just before the break, they had managed to disrupt the Dutch movement and give Bergkamp and Kluivert a pair of sore ankles apiece. </p> <p>They demonstrated more positive intentions early in the second half, almost taking the lead when Karel Poborsky just failed to make proper contact with Nedved's cross from the left. Nor was this a token effort. Suddenly Nemec was peppering the Dutch goal with shots from the left, while Koller finished an exchange of passes with Nedved with a clever shot which brought a brilliant diving save from Ed van der Sar. When Nedved hit the post from Vladimir Smicer's left wing cross, they were virtually over-running their hosts. </p> <p>With Holland's novice manager pacing the touchline, his players could make only a spasmodic response. Bergkamp's long cross brought a fierce but inaccurate volley from Ronald de Boer, but at the other end Poborsky won a free kick from a frustrated Reiziger and then watched as Koller met his free kick with an angled header which bounced off the Dutch crossbar. </p> <p>Not only had the home side mislaid their ability to link the play, they looked as though they had run out of ideas - surely a matter of serious concern after only an hour's play of a tournament in which, if they are to regain the trophy won by their predecessors in 1988, they will need to play half a dozen games. And they will not always have Signor Collina to come to their aid.</p>",

On the evidence of last night's match, Frank Rijkaard's first competitive game as manager, it may well be beyond them, unless they can continue such slices of luck as the one represented by Pierluigi Collina's award of a penalty for Jiri Nemec's challenge on Ronald de Boer. As expected, Rijkaard sent his side out in a straightforward 4-4-2 formation with Dennis Bergkamp in his favourite role of shadow striker, just behind Patrick Kluivert. Whenever Edgar Davids was pulling the strings from his normal station in central midfield, Holland looked dangerous. But Kluivert and Bergkamp were receiving harsh treatment from the Czech defence and the chances were few, with Pavel Srnicek making sprawling saves to deny Kluivert twice in the first quarter of an hour. Four years ago the Czechs were the surprise package of Euro 96, reaching the fi nal by beating France on penalties in the semi-final before taking Germany all the way to extra time. Unbeaten in their qualifying matches for this year's tournament, they are nobody's dark horses now. But their methods in the first half last night were not calculated to divert a neutral's affection away from the men in orange. With one extremely big man, Karel Rada, at the back and another, Jan Koller, up front, they relied on a posse of scurrying midfield players to make rapid breaks and to put themselves in the way of the Dutch as soon as possession was lost. By half-time they must have felt they were succeeding. Although they had mustered only a single shot, when Pavel Nedved lashed a 30-yard drive into the side netting just before the break, they had managed to disrupt the Dutch movement and give Bergkamp and Kluivert a pair of sore ankles apiece. They demonstrated more positive intentions early in the second half, almost taking the lead when Karel Poborsky just failed to make proper contact with Nedved's cross from the left. Nor was this a token effort. Suddenly Nemec was peppering the Dutch goal with shots from the left, while Koller finished an exchange of passes with Nedved with a clever shot which brought a brilliant diving save from Ed van der Sar. When Nedved hit the post from Vladimir Smicer's left wing cross, they were virtually over-running their hosts. With Holland's novice manager pacing the touchline, his players could make only a spasmodic response. Bergkamp's long cross brought a fierce but inaccurate volley from Ronald de Boer, but at the other end Poborsky won a free kick from a frustrated Reiziger and then watched as Koller met his free kick with an angled header which bounced off the Dutch crossbar. Not only had the home side mislaid their ability to link the play, they looked as though they had run out of ideas - surely a matter of serious concern after only an hour's play of a tournament in which, if they are to regain the trophy won by their predecessors in 1988, they will need to play half a dozen games. And they will not always have Signor Collina to come to their aid.",

      "body": "<p>\"No more excuses,\" says Humberto Coelho, Portugal's coach. He and his team are proud of the widespread admiration they attract from purists and romantics for the elegance of their play, but now is the time to turn all that aesthetic appeal into a trophy. </p> <p>Not that this means abandoning their principles. One thing Euro 2000 will not lack is tactical variety, and no team is likely to provide armchair analysts with a more absorbing sight than England's first opponents, whose coach is combining a conventional defence with a highly unorthodox attack in an attempt to bring success to a perennially underachieving nation. </p> <p>Coelho, aged 50, took over after Artur Jorge, his predecessor, had failed to win qualification for the last World Cup. A former libero with Benfica and Paris St Germain, known as the Portuguese Beckenbauer while receiving 64 caps between 1969 and 1983, he appears to have healed the rifts that characterised the previous regime, re-establishing unity within a squad based around a group of players who are in their late 20s and have played together since they were juniors. </p> <p>In front of a standard back four and two holding midfield players, Coelho has constructed an attacking unit around the composed skills of Manuel Rui Costa, the Fiorentina playmaker who was his country's most admired player in England four years ago. The three forwards are allotted nominal positions, but tend to rotate around Rui Costa in a manner which can make them hard to decipher for defenders accustomed to thinking in straight lines. </p> <p>Sometimes it works a treat. Portugal scored 32 goals in their qualifying matches, although it must be said that the opposition included Azerbaijan, Slovakia, Hungary and Lichtenstein, as well as the group winners, Romania. And in all the preparatory games for the tournament over the past few weeks, there has been nothing finer than the three goals scored by Luis Figo, Ricardo Sa Pinto and Nuno Capucho against Wales, each strike the product of luxuriant artistry combined with ruthless finishing. </p> <p>Here, it seems, might be the long-delayed realisation of the potential evident in 1989 and 1991, when Portugal won the European Under-20 championship with a cadre of young players who became known as the \"golden generation\", the heirs to the legacy of the great Portuguese teams of the middle 1960s. Mind you, something similar was being said in the run-up to the 1996 finals, when roughly the same group of players arrived in England and took on the role of sentimental favourites. They turned out to be not quite up to the task, beating Croatia 3-0 before falling to the Czech Republic by the only goal of their quarter-final, Karel Poborsky's memorable running lob. But the experience gained by their top players with some of Europe's biggest clubs over the last four years is unlikely to have done anything other than strengthen their ability to compete with top international sides. </p> <p>Oddly, Portugal have qualified only twice for the World Cup - although in 1966 they reached the semi-finals, falling to England after Eusebio had succumbed to the attentions of Nobby Stiles - and three times for the European championship, most memorably going down in the 1984 semi-final to a goal from Michel Platini which gave France, the ultimate champions, a 3-2 win in the last minute of extra-time. </p> <p>But a lack of confidence is unlikely to be a problem for Coelho's squad. Last week, in their final warm-up game, they put 11 goals past a Dutch amateur side without reply and without even bothering to remove their training tops. And in Luis Filipe Madeira Caeiro, better known as Luis Figo, they possess a player who ranks with Zinedine Zidane, Raul Gonzalez and Edgar Davids among the tournament's most valuable individuals. Spoken of by many top coaches as the best attacking player in Europe last season, Figo cannot win games by himself but he is strong, skilful and persistent, and at 27 he is in his prime. </p> <p>He is also one of those rare footballers capable of defining his own role. He wears a No7 on his back, and can be found most of the time on the right wing, from which he produces excellent crosses, but he likes to cut inside on runs that often carry him across to the opposite flank. Since he has both a fierce shot and a good sense of how to link the play, covering defenders can never be sure of his intentions. </p> <p>Phil Neville, who is likely to be marking him tonight, spoke admiringly of his gifts at England's training camp last week, but managed to sound as though he was looking forward to the contest. The way to handle him, Neville said, will be for England's left side to keep Portugal's right-back so well occupied that Figo is both starved of possession and forced back to help out with defensive duties. </p> <p>Portugal's other attacking players include Sa Pinto, the Real Sociedad forward who is the closest thing Coelho possesses to a recognised centre forward, and Joao Pinto, of Benfica, who is likely to line up on the left side.

      "bodyText": "\"No more excuses,\" says Humberto Coelho, Portugal's coach. He and his team are proud of the widespread admiration they attract from purists and romantics for the elegance of their play, but now is the time to turn all that aesthetic appeal into a trophy. Not that this means abandoning their principles. One thing Euro 2000 will not lack is tactical variety, and no team is likely to provide armchair analysts with a more absorbing sight than England's first opponents, whose coach is combining a conventional defence with a highly unorthodox attack in an attempt to bring success to a perennially underachieving nation. Coelho, aged 50, took over after Artur Jorge, his predecessor, had failed to win qualification for the last World Cup. A former libero with Benfica and Paris St Germain, known as the Portuguese Beckenbauer while receiving 64 caps between 1969 and 1983, he appears to have healed the rifts that characterised the previous regime, re-establishing unity within a squad based around a group of players who are in their late 20s and have played together since they were juniors. In front of a standard back four and two holding midfield players, Coelho has constructed an attacking unit around the composed skills of Manuel Rui Costa, the Fiorentina playmaker who was his country's most admired player in England four years ago. The three forwards are allotted nominal positions, but tend to rotate around Rui Costa in a manner which can make them hard to decipher for defenders accustomed to thinking in straight lines. Sometimes it works a treat. Portugal scored 32 goals in their qualifying matches, although it must be said that the opposition included Azerbaijan, Slovakia, Hungary and Lichtenstein, as well as the group winners, Romania. And in all the preparatory games for the tournament over the past few weeks, there has been nothing finer than the three goals scored by Luis Figo, Ricardo Sa Pinto and Nuno Capucho against Wales, each strike the product of luxuriant artistry combined with ruthless finishing. Here, it seems, might be the long-delayed realisation of the potential evident in 1989 and 1991, when Portugal won the European Under-20 championship with a cadre of young players who became known as the \"golden generation\", the heirs to the legacy of the great Portuguese teams of the middle 1960s. Mind you, something similar was being said in the run-up to the 1996 finals, when roughly the same group of players arrived in England and took on the role of sentimental favourites. They turned out to be not quite up to the task, beating Croatia 3-0 before falling to the Czech Republic by the only goal of their quarter-final, Karel Poborsky's memorable running lob. But the experience gained by their top players with some of Europe's biggest clubs over the last four years is unlikely to have done anything other than strengthen their ability to compete with top international sides. Oddly, Portugal have qualified only twice for the World Cup - although in 1966 they reached the semi-finals, falling to England after Eusebio had succumbed to the attentions of Nobby Stiles - and three times for the European championship, most memorably going down in the 1984 semi-final to a goal from Michel Platini which gave France, the ultimate champions, a 3-2 win in the last minute of extra-time. But a lack of confidence is unlikely to be a problem for Coelho's squad. Last week, in their final warm-up game, they put 11 goals past a Dutch amateur side without reply and without even bothering to remove their training tops. And in Luis Filipe Madeira Caeiro, better known as Luis Figo, they possess a player who ranks with Zinedine Zidane, Raul Gonzalez and Edgar Davids among the tournament's most valuable individuals. Spoken of by many top coaches as the best attacking player in Europe last season, Figo cannot win games by himself but he is strong, skilful and persistent, and at 27 he is in his prime. He is also one of those rare footballers capable of defining his own role. He wears a No7 on his back, and can be found most of the time on the right wing, from which he produces excellent crosses, but he likes to cut inside on runs that often carry him across to the opposite flank. Since he has both a fierce shot and a good sense of how to link the play, covering defenders can never be sure of his intentions. Phil Neville, who is likely to be marking him tonight, spoke admiringly of his gifts at England's training camp last week, but managed to sound as though he was looking forward to the contest. The way to handle him, Neville said, will be for England's left side to keep Portugal's right-back so well occupied that Figo is both starved of possession and forced back to help out with defensive duties. Portugal's other attacking players include Sa Pinto, the Real Sociedad forward who is the closest thing Coelho possesses to a recognised centre forward, and Joao Pinto, of Benfica, who is likely to line up on the left side. Rui Costa's companions in midfield will probably include Capucho of FC Porto and Sergio Conceicao of Lazio. \"We may be more or less the same group as in '96, but we're much more experienced now, particularly in midfield,\" Rui Costa observed. \"Whatever shape the team is asked to adopt, we're confident. When we play with only one attacker, perhaps it gives Figo and Joao Pinto more freedom. But we've got other formations that we can use, with an extra attacking midfield player or two strikers, depending on the opposition.\" Pre-tournament injury worries have surrounded their goalkeeper and captain, Vitor Baia, whose 69 caps are a Portuguese record, Abel Xavier, the Everton defender, and Sa Pinto, who injured his right knee before the weekend. All are apparently responding to treatment but another troublesome right knee has cost them the services tonight of Paulo Sousa, the player described by Rui Costa as \"fundamental\" to the team. \"Even though we aren't among the favourites,\" Rui Costa concluded, \"we're hoping for strong performances and we want to go as far as possible, maybe even all the way to the final day. The Portuguese people expect a lot of us, and that puts a lot of pressure on the players, but we accept it. And it's the same for everyone in a tournament like this - the first game is vital. Against England, we want to get off to a good start.\"",

Tonight, as his team take on Portugal here in their opening game of Euro 2000, the nation will begin to find out if he has a similar stamp of greatness as England coach or whether at this level he is merely an optimistic pipsqueak. </p> <p>It is hard to recall a time when so much of the country wanted a popular personality to do well, yet so few people had confidence in the ability of the England team to do well by him. The fitful, desperate manner of England's qualification under both Keegan and Glenn Hoddle has had much to do with this, but as Tony Adams said at the weekend: \"That's gone, finished. It really doesn't matter how you get there.\" </p> <p>True enough, yet the reality is that unless England show a marked improvement on the majority of their performances in the qualifiers they will be swiftly exposed by the punctilious nature of Portugal's passing game and reduced to trusting in the wayward nature of Portuguese finishing. Rarely has an England side needed to concentrate so hard on not giving the ball, and possibly the game, away. </p> <p>Such thinking will influence the mood and character of the team Keegan will field tonight. The England coach is acutely conscious of his limitations as a tactician and does not want to be remembered as a cardboard cavalier, abandoning caution and leaving his side exposed to sucker counterpunches. </p> <p>England, therefore, will approach Portugal much as they approached Brazil at Wembley just over a fortnight ago. The need to attack will be tempered by the necessity to cover space and not get caught out by opponents well tutored in the art of infiltrating defences. </p> <p>Keegan is well aware of the importance of achieving the correct balance. \"If we set out to stop Portugal then we'll be thrown on to the back foot immediately,\" he said last night. \"Of course we'll have to defend well but there will be times when we need to go forward and cause them problems. I like my teams to be adventurous because that's the sort of person I am.\" </p> <p> Tonight, however, it will not be a case of adventure unlimited. \"I knew my team two weeks ago,\" Keegan admitted, and few will be surprised if he makes just the one change to the side that held the Brazilians 1-1, a result that would leave both England and Portugal satisfied, if unfulfilled, here this evening. It may simply be a case of Adams replacing Martin Keown in the back four and leaving the rest unaltered. </p> <p>This would mean Dennis Wise retaining the short straw in the angst-ridden position on the left of midfield with the specific task of denying Luis Figo free runs at Phil Neville. Of course Keegan could yet persuade himself that Steve McManaman's natural aggression might have the same effect, but the England coach was impressed by the way Wise handled Brazil's Cafu. </p> <p>The other matter Keegan has to decide is whether playing Sol Campbell alongside Adams would be too big a risk given Campbell's alarming loss of form and judgement in recent England games. Keown is Adams's regular partner at Arsenal, and with his tenacity and powers of concentration is better equipped to snuff out a specific danger. </p> <p>Either way one of the more crucial roles tonight will be performed by Paul Ince, who played in front of the back four against Brazil and was England's outstanding player for the way he read and restricted the runs of Rivaldo, Amoroso and Ze Roberto. Keegan will want Ince to repeat the process against Rui Costa, the Portuguese player most likely to get between England's midfield and their defence. </p> <p><strong> Attacking potential</strong><br> </p> <p> The way Paul Scholes is used tonight will be equally important. For some Keegan's order to Scholes \"not to get on his bike\" against Brazil but to play more of a holding game in midfield was evidence of the coach's readiness to compromise his positive instincts and deny England the free spirit that had so uplifted Newcastle United. </p> <p>Yet Keegan possesses, in Scholes, Wise, McManaman, David Beckham, Alan Shearer, Michael Owen, Robbie Fowler and so on, the attacking potential to make a significant impact this time and banish to history the trail of tears that European championships had become for England teams before Euro 96. Keegan, remember, would have achieved something no other England manager has if he wins three matches in open play in this tournament. </p> <p>It is less a matter of being cautious than taking care. That is taking care not to hand Portugal an early initiative with one careless pass. Taking care not to be caught on the break in a natural eagerness to score the first goal. Taking care not to invite long periods of Portuguese possession through aimless clearances or hopeless punts up the flanks from Gary or Phil Neville. </p> <p> If Campbell does play he should be discouraged from making too many of those ambitious forays deep into the opposing half that may rouse England's supporters but usually set up counter-attacks when, almost inevitably, he loses the ball. Adams is better at going forward but England are as far away as ever from possessing defenders who can step out from the back at their ease and cause considerable problems with their creative play. </p> <p>If England are to win tonight so much will depend on Owen getting the ball early enough and accurately enough to use his pace to catch Portugal's defenders on the turn. Shearer's strength in holding the ball up should enable Scholes to make those runs into scoring positions so crucial at this stage, and the quality of Beckham's crosses, whether in free play or from set-pieces, remains England's most reliable source of goals. </p> <p>Having resumed training on Saturday morning and trained again yesterday evening Shearer's participation is no longer in doubt. Nevertheless the England captain has needed an anti-inflammatory injection to ease his knee injury. </p> <p>Win or draw, a sound, solid performance against Portugal will give England added confidence to take on Germany and allay some of the fears that the art of English farce is not dead, merely dormant.

      "body": "<p>Football journalists are a decent bunch on the whole. Tony Adams is reading Henry V but despite the sharp intake of breath that greeted this unlikely news nobody spoiled things by telling him who won. </p> <p>\"I've had an interest in Henry V for some time,\" Adams explained. So shortly before England departed for Euro 2000 he bought a copy in a Putney bookshop. </p> <p>Question: \"Did the guy say have a good European Championship?\" </p> <p>Answer: \"No, he said \u00a32.99 please. I'm no different from any other human being going in and buying a book.\" </p> <p>In truth there is more of ancient Pistol about Adams nowadays than Harry the king. Last September he had a double hernia operation and more recently he has had a spot of back ache. And though Adams insists that \"I'm fitter than I've ever been,\" he is careful to add that \"I'm 33 not 19 so I cherish each moment as though it might be my last\". </p> <p>Interviews with Tony Adams have become something of a tradition before England's first match in a major tournament. As a reformed alcoholic and changed character he is almost the holy man blessing the troops on their way to the front. </p> <p>Adams, however, no longer sounds like a suitable case for counselling and has broken the habit of talking about himself in the third person, which could get a little confusing. Yet it is clear that he continues to live for the day, the match, the moment, and that this is the attitude he will adopt for England's opening game against Portugal here tonight. </p> <p>In Kevin Keegan's eyes Adams is the team's most important defender, perhaps its most important player. For those who recall Marco van Basten turning him inside out in D\u00fcsseldorf when England were knocked out of the 1988 European Championship by Holland this may be an alarming prospect. But others might be more inclined to remember the heroic figure around whom England rallied against Argentina in St Etienne in the last World Cup after David Beckham's dismissal. </p> <p>In the end England still went out of the tournament prematurely, albeit on penalties, but the epic nature of their failure spared them public vilification, quite the opposite in fact. \"I wish people realised that we hadn't won the World Cup,' said Adams. \"All right it is an unfortunate way to go out but you're only successful if you win things. Reaching the semi-finals in Euro 96 was not a triumph. We didn't win it.\" </p> <p>Like all of Keegan's players Adams has to believe that winning Euro 2000 is a possibility, but he has now played for his country under five different managers and might be forgiven a degree of world-weariness as he prepares to re-enter a tournament that has so often found England wanting. </p> <p>Instead Adams prefers to keep faith with fate. \"Sometimes it's your moment, it's your time,\" he muses. \"But sometimes you get injuries and people dip in and out of form. If they dip into form at the right time then you've got a chance of winning it. </p> <p>\"Obviously you've got to have talent. You have to work and prepare, but it's not just a matter of hard work and having luck at the right time. To win these tournaments you need talent.\" </p> <p>Adams shares the general affection for Keegan. \"Kevin runs a happy ship and the boys are very happy playing under him,\" he insisted. \"They also like him as a person. Kevin's biggest quality is being open to all suggestions from everyone. He encourages feedback. I think he wants that in a relationship. He doesn't want it all one way. He'll ask the players what they think.\" </p> <p>Once Alan Shearer has retired from international football after this tournament Adams will take the captain's armband as England begin the task of qualifying for the 2002 World Cup. For Adams, having captained England under Terry Venables, it will hardly be a novel experience. </p> <p>But as he explained: \"Captaincy depends on your relationship with the manager. If you've got the armband on you sometimes get more respect from the players but here they seem to respect me anyway, armband or not.\" </p> <p>This is as it should be. When Steven Gerrard won his first full cap against Ukraine Adams took the 20-year-old Liverpool midfielder aside for a chat later described by Keegan as the most important two minutes of Gerrard's career so far. </p> <p>\"I didn't want him to miss the day,\" Adams explained. \"My England debut [against Spain in Madrid in 1987] just went past me. I wanted if I could to help someone appreciate the moment.\" </p> <p>Certainly Adams will appreciate his moment in Eindhoven this evening. He is not going to quote aloud from Henry V until or unless England make significant progress in Euro 96, but you hope he has reached the bit about storming breaches and trust that the walls he organises will not be filled with English dead.</p>",

Adams, however, no longer sounds like a suitable case for counselling and has broken the habit of talking about himself in the third person, which could get a little confusing. Yet it is clear that he continues to live for the day, the match, the moment, and that this is the attitude he will adopt for England's opening game against Portugal here tonight. In Kevin Keegan's eyes Adams is the team's most important defender, perhaps its most important player. For those who recall Marco van Basten turning him inside out in D\u00fcsseldorf when England were knocked out of the 1988 European Championship by Holland this may be an alarming prospect. But others might be more inclined to remember the heroic figure around whom England rallied against Argentina in St Etienne in the last World Cup after David Beckham's dismissal. In the end England still went out of the tournament prematurely, albeit on penalties, but the epic nature of their failure spared them public vilification, quite the opposite in fact. \"I wish people realised that we hadn't won the World Cup,' said Adams. \"All right it is an unfortunate way to go out but you're only successful if you win things. Reaching the semi-finals in Euro 96 was not a triumph. We didn't win it.\" Like all of Keegan's players Adams has to believe that winning Euro 2000 is a possibility, but he has now played for his country under five different managers and might be forgiven a degree of world-weariness as he prepares to re-enter a tournament that has so often found England wanting. Instead Adams prefers to keep faith with fate. \"Sometimes it's your moment, it's your time,\" he muses. \"But sometimes you get injuries and people dip in and out of form. If they dip into form at the right time then you've got a chance of winning it. \"Obviously you've got to have talent. You have to work and prepare, but it's not just a matter of hard work and having luck at the right time. To win these tournaments you need talent.\" Adams shares the general affection for Keegan. \"Kevin runs a happy ship and the boys are very happy playing under him,\" he insisted. \"They also like him as a person. Kevin's biggest quality is being open to all suggestions from everyone. He encourages feedback. I think he wants that in a relationship. He doesn't want it all one way. He'll ask the players what they think.\" Once Alan Shearer has retired from international football after this tournament Adams will take the captain's armband as England begin the task of qualifying for the 2002 World Cup. For Adams, having captained England under Terry Venables, it will hardly be a novel experience. But as he explained: \"Captaincy depends on your relationship with the manager. If you've got the armband on you sometimes get more respect from the players but here they seem to respect me anyway, armband or not.\" This is as it should be. When Steven Gerrard won his first full cap against Ukraine Adams took the 20-year-old Liverpool midfielder aside for a chat later described by Keegan as the most important two minutes of Gerrard's career so far. \"I didn't want him to miss the day,\" Adams explained. \"My England debut [against Spain in Madrid in 1987] just went past me. I wanted if I could to help someone appreciate the moment.\" Certainly Adams will appreciate his moment in Eindhoven this evening. He is not going to quote aloud from Henry V until or unless England make significant progress in Euro 96, but you hope he has reached the bit about storming breaches and trust that the walls he organises will not be filled with English dead.",

Three minutes of time added on to play. Scrappy play sees out the half before referee Frisk blows for full-time. England 2 - 3 Portugal. All very deflating after England's dream start.",

The hunters are about to become the hunted.</p> <p>Almost all the arguments deployed on both sides in the debate are nonsense. Hunting will cost rural jobs but not as many as the Countryside Alliance claims; compared with the crisis that continues to dog UK manufacturing, the numbers are a drop in the ocean: rural life will go on.</p> <p>The conservation arguments are also largely bogus: the numbers of foxes killed by hunts is relatively low and hunting an inefficient way of controlling the fox population. As we learned recently, the Beaufort hunt has to encourage foxes by feeding them and protecting their earths before it kills them: hunts want to claim a socially useful function and set themselves up as the farmer's friend, but don't believe them. Hunters hunt because they enjoy it. But they don't, as the anti-hunters world have it, do it for the pleasure of the kill. Ignore talk of all those blood-smearing rituals.</p> <p>They do it for the thrill of the chase, the camaraderie among hunters, the love of the hounds, the pleasure of the countryside. Most of them couldn't care less whether the fox is caught or, as it frequently does, escapes, though they would like it to be a good couple of hours before the hounds lose the scent.</p> <p>In any case, when a fox is caught and killed there are likely to be very few of the hunt present. A hunt comprises an elite group - comprising the master of foxhounds, his professional staff and the odd distinguished visitor - and everyone else, usually called \"the field\", who trail behind trying to keep up, jumping what fences they can and frequently falling off. Following a long chase, the hunting field can resemble the Grand National after a particularly dramatic race. The kill is neither here nor there; the game, the chase, is the thing.</p> <p>Just as blood lust should be discounted, so should the idea of hunting being exclusively for toffs. Lots of toffs hunt, the royal family and aristos hunt, keeping horses (and to hunt regularly you need several) is expensive, but farmers hunt, solicitors hunt, insurance salesmen hunt, and lots of less wealthy people follow the hunt on foot. It is a rural day out, a chance to meet, talk, gossip, socialise. The fox is just an excuse for a get-together.</p> <p>The hunting debate has been hijacked by extremes on both sides: the animal cruelty mob who will happily hit a hunter on the head with a pole to make their point (their idea of humane treatment does not seem to extend to mammals without fur) and the ultra-conservatives who argue that all rural life will end if a ban is passed.</p> <p>I am somewhere in between, an agnostic about hunting. I believe that its ancient traditions cannot be lightly cast aside, that it is not the brutal, bloody, elitist activity berated by the animal rights brigade, that is does have an important function. But I also believe that the fox feels fear in the course of the hunt, that it recognises it is running for its life, that we are making sport of its suffering.</p> <p>The issue is desperately difficult and none of the practical arguments alluded to above - jobs, conservation, rural stability - really helps. It is a moral issue.</p> <p>A couple of years ago, to get an insight into this thorniest of subjects, I went hunting with the Beaufort on a lovely, crisp December day down in Gloucestershire. Prince Charles was out with the hunt that day, though he joined the elite group up front and you caught only the occasional glimpse of him. I had borrowed a horse and was looked after by a marvellous man, a former master of foxhounds and excellent rider. At one point he noticed that another member of the field had fallen off and her horse had bolted; he excused himself and rode off in pursuit, reining the horse in and returning it to its bruised rider. (The number of injuries and deaths among participants is high: any true anti-toff agitator would campaign for the retention of hunting as a way of reducing the old landed elite.)</p> <p>My escort's main interest was in watching the hounds work. After 40 years of hunting (his father had also been mad-keen), he could understand what the dogs were telling each other as they combed copses sniffing for the scent. He took an aesthetic pleasure in the hunt, and that ultimately is the crux of the argument. Are we willing to foreclose on an activity that has been a central element in rural life, the heart of National Hunt racing, and a contributor to our literature (Siegfried Sassoon, the great poet and pacifist, was an obsessive, four-days-a-week hunter, hardly bearing out the blood-lust linkage)?</p> <p>Hunting is part of the fabric of British life, and has been for centuries. It is where much of sport began. It has contributed greatly to our language, to a particular way of seeing the world. Critics will say that, in their time, bear-baiting and cock-fighting played the same cultural role, but hunting is more deeply entrenched, less obviously vicious (bears were baited, cocks torn apart, in combat, for pleasure and as a gambling medium).</p> <p>My day with the Beaufort left me with a higher estimation of huntsmen and a realisation of the social and cultural value of hunting. I am still left sitting uncomfortably on the fence, wary of the committed on both sides, but what I do know is that if hunting is banned something important will have been silenced, a slice of life lost, a way of seeing erased.</p> <p>A little humility among those claiming the moral high ground and demanding an end to barbarism would be in order.</p>",

Lots of toffs hunt, the royal family and aristos hunt, keeping horses (and to hunt regularly you need several) is expensive, but farmers hunt, solicitors hunt, insurance salesmen hunt, and lots of less wealthy people follow the hunt on foot. It is a rural day out, a chance to meet, talk, gossip, socialise. The fox is just an excuse for a get-together. The hunting debate has been hijacked by extremes on both sides: the animal cruelty mob who will happily hit a hunter on the head with a pole to make their point (their idea of humane treatment does not seem to extend to mammals without fur) and the ultra-conservatives who argue that all rural life will end if a ban is passed. I am somewhere in between, an agnostic about hunting. I believe that its ancient traditions cannot be lightly cast aside, that it is not the brutal, bloody, elitist activity berated by the animal rights brigade, that is does have an important function. But I also believe that the fox feels fear in the course of the hunt, that it recognises it is running for its life, that we are making sport of its suffering. The issue is desperately difficult and none of the practical arguments alluded to above - jobs, conservation, rural stability - really helps. It is a moral issue. A couple of years ago, to get an insight into this thorniest of subjects, I went hunting with the Beaufort on a lovely, crisp December day down in Gloucestershire. Prince Charles was out with the hunt that day, though he joined the elite group up front and you caught only the occasional glimpse of him. I had borrowed a horse and was looked after by a marvellous man, a former master of foxhounds and excellent rider. At one point he noticed that another member of the field had fallen off and her horse had bolted; he excused himself and rode off in pursuit, reining the horse in and returning it to its bruised rider. (The number of injuries and deaths among participants is high: any true anti-toff agitator would campaign for the retention of hunting as a way of reducing the old landed elite.) My escort's main interest was in watching the hounds work. After 40 years of hunting (his father had also been mad-keen), he could understand what the dogs were telling each other as they combed copses sniffing for the scent. He took an aesthetic pleasure in the hunt, and that ultimately is the crux of the argument. Are we willing to foreclose on an activity that has been a central element in rural life, the heart of National Hunt racing, and a contributor to our literature (Siegfried Sassoon, the great poet and pacifist, was an obsessive, four-days-a-week hunter, hardly bearing out the blood-lust linkage)? Hunting is part of the fabric of British life, and has been for centuries. It is where much of sport began. It has contributed greatly to our language, to a particular way of seeing the world. Critics will say that, in their time, bear-baiting and cock-fighting played the same cultural role, but hunting is more deeply entrenched, less obviously vicious (bears were baited, cocks torn apart, in combat, for pleasure and as a gambling medium). My day with the Beaufort left me with a higher estimation of huntsmen and a realisation of the social and cultural value of hunting. I am still left sitting uncomfortably on the fence, wary of the committed on both sides, but what I do know is that if hunting is banned something important will have been silenced, a slice of life lost, a way of seeing erased. A little humility among those claiming the moral high ground and demanding an end to barbarism would be in order.",

Ravi Shastri confirms that he was informed by Prabhakar of Kapil's alleged bribe, and that he told him to report it to the team management immediately. Thursday May 25 Speaking of the recommended life bans, Rashid Latif, one of the chief whistle-blowers, calls for other countries to administer similar punishments: \"Pakistan has set an example, and other countries must follow suit.\" Greg Melick, a former National Crime Authority member, is appointed as the Australian Board's special investigator into match-fixing. His first brief is to investigate Salim Malik's claim that Australia were involved in a \"double fix\" with Pakistan in 1994-95. Bob Woolmer rejects Ashley Mallett's allegations, saying \"We were beaten fair and square in that Test, and the reason we lost was Shane Warne, not Pat Symcox.\" Friday May 26 In The Sun, Ian Botham describes cricket as \"rotten to the core\", and calls for an independent enquiry from a non-cricket nation \"like the United States\" to get to the bottom of the problem. In Lahore, Salim Malik outlines plans to appeal to General Pervaz Musharraf, Pakistan's military leader, against his life ban. Malik says that, once he has received formal confirmation of the ban, he will go to court to clear his name. Saturday May 27 In New Delhi, Prabhakar unveils a secret 45-minute video showing players and administrators making various match-fixing assertions to a hidden camera. The names of Kapil Dev, Mohammad Azharuddin, Ajay Sharma and Ajay Jadeja crop up repeatedly. Prabhakar promises to hand the complete recording to the police, saying \"I know I will be friendless in cricket circles after this ... [but] I owed it to the game.\" Fresh allegations on an Australian radio station, apparently based on the News of the World's tapes, suggest that Asif Iqbal, the former Pakistan captain who is now one of ICC's \"special ambassadors for cricket\", acted as a go-between for Salim Malik. Sunday May 28 Indian police say they have identified \"seven to eight prominent bookies\" who laid odds on the five one-day internationals South Africa played in India in March, from which the original Cronje allegations arose. Monday May 29 Indian police ask Interpol to help them gain voice samples of Hansie Cronje: \"Once we have all that, we will start thinking of extraditing Cronje and the others charged in this case.\" Tuesday May 30 Maite Nkoana Mashabane, the South African High Commissioner in India, is quoted as saying that SA will allow Indian detectives to question Cronje, so long as the request is \"need-based and issue-based\". John Bacon, secretary of the King Commission, says they are to call between 35 and 45 witnesses when the hearing begins on June 7; these may include England captain Nasser Hussain.",

      "body": "<p> <strong>Friday April 7</strong><br> The allegations break. <strong>Hansie Cronje</strong>, <strong>Pieter Strydom</strong>, <strong>Nicky Boje</strong> and <strong>Herschelle Gibbs</strong> are charged by Indian police with \"cheating, fraud and criminal conspiracy relating to match-fixing and betting\". </p> <p> New Delhi police release transcripts of a conversation thought to be between <strong>Cronje</strong> and a businessman, <strong>Sanjeev Chawla</strong>. <strong>Strydom</strong>, <strong>Gibbs</strong> and <strong>Boje</strong> are explicitly mentioned, and <strong>\"Cronje\"</strong> goes on to say that he cannot \"get\" any more players as \"The other guys are already angry with me because I have not received their money.\"</p> <p> <strong>Ali Bacher</strong>, managing director of the United Cricket Board of South Africa (UCBSA), defends <strong>Cronje's integrity</strong>. <strong>Cronje</strong> says he is innocent of the charges: \"I am stunned. The allegations are completely without substance.\" <strong>Jagmohan Dalmiya</strong>, the ICC president, announces: \"If there is any grey side to it, we [ICC] will take care of it. We have our own way of working.\"</p> <p> <strong>Kepler Wessels</strong> (Cronje's predecessor as captain) calls for \"A fully independent and impartial enquiry\".</p> <p><strong>Saturday April 8</strong><br> <strong>Rajesh Kalra</strong>, the Indian bookmaker at the centre of the allegations, admits to India Today that he offered players $4-500,000 to fix the one-day series between India and South Africa in March.</p> <p> <strong>Krishan Kumar</strong>, a former Bollywood actor, is interrogated by Indian police and then admitted to hospital suffering from an angina attack.</p> <p><strong>Sunday April 9</strong><br> <strong>Cronje</strong>, <strong>Gibbs</strong> and <strong>Boje</strong> hold a press conference. Cronje says he never received money \"during the one-day series in India\" nor spoke to any member of his team about \"throwing a game\". <strong>Gibbs</strong> says: \"We weren't approached by anybody and Hansie didn't speak to us about the subject.\" <strong>Boje</strong> adds: \"Hansie never spoke to us about anything to help him in throwing a game.\"</p> <p> The UBCSA president <strong>Percy Sonn</strong> dismisses the allegations as \"spurious\". A Foreign Ministry spokesman expresses disgust at the tapping of <strong>Cronje's</strong> phone: \"This goes against all diplomatic norms and is a major invasion of privacy.\" India continues to deny access to the tapes. </p> <p> <strong>Trevor Chesterfield</strong>, a cricket journalist for the Pretoria Star, says he overheard the tape while waiting to be interviewed on Indian radio, and that it doesn't sound like <strong>Cronje</strong>. It is later claimed that he heard a reconstruction of the tape, voiced by Indian actors.</p> <p> The Sunday Times reports an experienced Indian crime journalist as saying that <strong>KK Paul</strong>, the New Delhi police commissioner, was being \"as straight-forward as a police officer can be\". </p> <p><strong>Monday April 10</strong><br> New Delhi crime branch chief <strong>Pradeep Srivastava</strong> says he has new \"clinching\" evidence to prove Cronje and Chawla were in contact during the ODIs in India.</p> <p> Interpol confirms that Scotland Yard will be asked to investigate the alleged payments; Indian police want to know Chawla's bank-account details.</p> <p> <strong>Kalra</strong> tells police that the Kochin ODI was fixed for $300,000, but that the bookies had suffered a big loss when South Africa made over 300.</p> <p> <strong>Cronje</strong> withdraws from the two upcoming benefit games in aid of <strong>Sachin Tendulkar</strong>. <strong>Bob Woolmer</strong>, former SA coach, and Australia's <strong>Justin Langer</strong> express their support for Cronje. Australian captain <strong>Steve Waugh</strong> calls for all cheats to be banned from the game.</p> <p><strong>Tuesday April 11</strong><br> <strong>Cronje</strong> is sacked from the South African captaincy after he phones <strong>Bacher</strong> at 3am to admit \"dishonesty\". He is said to have broken down uncontrollably when a friend rang to ask how he was feeling.</p> <p> At a 1pm press conference, <strong>Bacher</strong> says Cronje admits receiving money during the ODI series with India, but that he denies match-fixing: \"During the England-Zimbabwe triangular series, contact was made with him by a local South African and a bookmaker of Indian origin based in London ... the result was that <strong>Cronje</strong> was given $10-15,000 which he took home.\" He adds that <strong>Cronje</strong> had denied being party to match-fixing, but that the UCBSA are \"shattered ... we have been deceived\". <strong>Shaun Pollock</strong>, who also appears at the press conference, is appointed captain.</p> <p> Simultaneously, <strong>Cronje</strong> issues a statement through <strong>Balfour Ngconde</strong>, the sports minister. He denies speaking to any other players about match-fixing, confusingly saying he \"received no financial rewards\". Again he protests that \"the allegations are devoid of all truth\".</p> <p> The ICC call for an \"immediate and thorough investigation\", while Indian police claim they have been vindicated. <strong>KK Paul</strong> says <strong>Kalra</strong> has given \"more names\", none Indian, but admits that the police caught Cronje by accident, after he borrowed Kalra's mobile phone.</p> <p><strong>Wednesday April 12</strong><br> <strong>Bacher</strong> says he doesn't think any other South African players are involved: \"We have been let down once, and I hope to God we are not let down again.\"</p> <p> <strong>Wessels</strong> says the damage to SA's cricket is irreparable: \"It is not enough to take the word of the players as the UCB appear to have done.\" <strong>Allan Donald</strong> admits the affair makes a \"big dent\" in South Africa's achievements.</p> <p> <strong>Maite Nkoane-Mashabane</strong>, SA's high commissioner to India, says her country is now willing to co-operate with the Indian police \"in any way\".</p> <p> <strong>Dalmiya</strong> promises a full-scale ICC enquiry, saying \"any attempt to interfere with the fair conduct of sport is totally unacceptable\". The South African findings will go before ICC's Code of Conduct Commission, chaired by <strong>Lord Griffiths</strong>.</p> <p> Worrying new allegations emerge. <strong>Tony Greig</strong>, the former England captain, claims there is more to come: \"There are other players involved, Indians as well.\" The Delhi police are investigating a \"much bigger affair\", writes <strong>Vinod Mehta</strong> in India's Outlook magazine.</p> <p> <strong>Inderjit Singh Bindra</strong> (former president of the Indian Board) says the Board is hiding important information about Indian players. He claims that three players have been consistently involved in betting since 1996, and that the Board knows who they are. The Board responds by pledging that any player found guilty of match-fixing will be banned for life.</p> <p> England's fifth-Test victory at Centurion in January comes under suspicion. Was <strong>Cronje</strong> really such a good sport? The fact that a draw was avoided saved the bookies a fortune.</p> <p><strong>Thursday April 13</strong><br> Match referee <strong>Barry Jarman</strong> denies that the Centurion Test was fixed. \"There was nothing there to suggest anything had been manufactured,\" he says. He is backed up by Sporting Index, whose chairman insists that it was \"the least likely game ever played\" to have been manipulated, as there was simply \"no time for anything to be contrived between players and bookmakers\".</p> <p> It emerges that the sum <strong>Cronje</strong> took was $8200. His wife Bertha counted it for the first time in front of lawyers. <strong>Bacher</strong> says Cronje has not told him what he did to earn the money.</p> <p> <strong>Hamid \"Banjo\" Cassim</strong> is alleged to be the go-between for Cronje and Chawla. He is also said to know India's recent captains <strong>Mohammad Azharuddin</strong> and <strong>Sachin Tendulkar</strong>.</p> <p> In a prepared statement, <strong>Cronje</strong> says he can't respond fully to the allegations, since the authorities had not yet made clear the basis of the charges. He again denies match-fixing, and says \"speculation and criticism directed against other members of the team is wrong and unjustified\".</p> <p> Indian police announce a hotel link between <strong>Cronje</strong>, <strong>Chawla</strong> and <strong>Kumar</strong>. In February, while <strong>Cronje</strong> was in Room 811 of Bombay's Taj Hotel, a Sanjeev <strong>Chawla</strong> stayed in Room 631. His bill was later paid by <strong>Kumar</strong>.</p> <p> Indian revenue detectives begin a 48-hour interrogation of <strong>Kalra</strong>. They ask where the \"huge funds\" involved in the match-fixing charges came from, and details of overseas bank accounts.</p> <p> <strong>Lance Klusener</strong> vehemently denies being the man who tipped off the Delhi police, who confirm he had nothing to do with it.</p> <p> New transcripts throw suspicion on the last game of the five-match ODI series against India at Nagpur in March. The tape has <strong>\"Cronje\"</strong> saying that he will open the bowling with offspinner <strong>Derek Crookes</strong>. He did. He also predicts that \"we will be bowling our non-regular bowlers\". Part-time left-armer <strong>Strydom</strong> bowls a full ten overs.</p> <p> <strong>SS Dhindsa</strong>, India's sports minister, calls for a report on India's recent poor Test performances (they lost 2-0 at home to South Africa, shortly after being whitewashed 3-0 in Australia). A high-level meeting is arranged for April 27: <strong>Azhar</strong>, <strong>Tendulkar</strong>, <strong>Kapil Dev</strong> and <strong>Sourav Ganguly</strong> are all summoned.</p> <p> <strong>Ray Illingworth</strong> reveals that he was approached by a Pakistani book-maker to throw a match during the 1996 World Cup. He was England's manager (and chairman of selectors) at the time.</p> <p> ECB chairman <strong>Lord MacLaurin</strong> calls for an urgent ICC conference: \"If this were a business, we'd have an emergency board meeting.\" He says that any player in breach of the ICC Code of Conduct should be banned for life.</p> <p> <strong>Cronje's</strong> sponsors desert him, and a Reserve Bank official tells SA's Citizen newspaper that he could face a $38,000 fine possessing foreign currency. </p> <p> A poll for the <em>Cape Times</em> reveals that 94% of South Africans want Cronje to play international cricket again.</p> <p><strong>Friday April 14</strong><br> New captain <strong>Shaun Pollock</strong> dedicates South Africa's victory over Australia in the ODI in Durban (the first game since the scandal broke) to <strong>Cronje</strong>.</p> <p><strong>Saturday April 15</strong><br> It emerges that South Africa needed three team meetings before rejecting $250,000 to fix an ODI in India in 1996. It is alleged that only <strong>Jonty Rhodes</strong>, <strong>Andrew Hudson</strong> and <strong>Dave Richardson</strong> were against the idea. \"No-one really wanted to play,\" said Richardson.</p> <p> <strong>Gibbs</strong> again denies the allegations. He tells the Cape Argus: \"Nothing would make me do something so irresponsible. Nobody approached us. When we were told about it we were terribly shocked.\"</p> <p> Suspicions grow about the Centurion Test. <strong>Daryll Cullinan</strong> says: \"I would like to think that Hansie was acting in the interest of the game and doing something for the public, but it totally went against the guy I know.\"</p> <p> <strong>Derek Crookes</strong> admits he was very surprised when <strong>Cronje</strong> asked him to open the bowling in Nagpur. Cronje had earlier told him he wouldn't open in the series.</p> <p><strong>Sunday April 16</strong><br> <strong>Justice Malik Mohammad Qayyum</strong>, the judge who investigated match-fixing allegations in Pakistan, says he \"found rock-solid evidence ... which confirmed some Pakistan players accepted bribes to tamper with the results of international matches.\" He recommended life bans for those players. The ICC is yet to see the report.</p> <p> <strong>Azharuddin</strong> is implicated. He is named by <strong>Kalra</strong>, and it emerges that he also knows <strong>Cassim</strong>. His wife protests his innocence. <strong>V Gupta</strong>, an income-tax commissioner, says that two months ago an Indian player declared an inexplicably large income of \u00a32million.</p> <p> <strong>Chris Lewis</strong> claims in the News of the World that when he was approached last summer by <strong>Ashim Kheterpal</strong>, a sports promoter, he was told that three senior England players were involved in match-fixing.</p> <p><strong>Monday April 17</strong><br> <strong>ICC</strong> calls an emergency meeting for May 2-3: \"A summit meeting must be held to consider what further actions must be taken to rid our sport of this major problem,\" says <strong>Dalmiya</strong>.</p> <p> <strong>Michael Parkinson</strong> writes in the Daily Telegraph: \"It is time for the ICC to start acting like a governing body instead of a seedy public-relations agency.\"</p> <p><strong>Tuesday April 18</strong><br> <strong>Lewis</strong> meets ECB officials to give them the names of the three players he'd been told were involved. The ECB pass the information on to the police for thorough investigation, although Gareth James, Lewis's agent, says the names were given to the police last September.</p> <p> <strong>Azharuddin</strong> and <strong>Tendulkar</strong> both emphatically deny any match-fixing. <strong>Azhar</strong> says all the allegations are \"false, untrue, baseless and of no substance\"; <strong>Tendulkar</strong> says he has followed his \"conscience and duty\" and \"stayed clear from all undesirable elements\".</p> <p> <strong>Andy Flower</strong>, Zimbabwe's captain, says he has long suspected \"shenanigans\" in some competitions. He says: \"There have been instances I thought the opposition did not quite look themselves.\"</p> <p><strong>Wednesday April 19</strong><br> <strong>Lewis</strong> claims that the ECB were \"not interested\" when he offered to pass on players' names last summer.</p> <p> <strong>IS Bindra</strong> says \"Hansie Cronje has emerged as the biggest hero in this episode. It is Hansie who is going to save world cricket and nobody else.\" He then claims that \"virtually every game in international cricket is fixed\". <strong>Kapil Dev</strong>, now India's coach, calls for cricket to \"stop\" until the allegations have been dealt with.</p> <p> <strong>Bacher</strong> claims that two of last year's World Cup matches were fixed, and that he has been told that an international umpire was involved with bookmakers.</p> <p><strong>Thursday April 20</strong><br> <strong>Ashim Kheterpal</strong> rejects <strong>Lewis's</strong> claims and dismisses him as a \"fraud\".</p> <p> Bombay police reveal they have more tape-recordings of phone conversations between bookies and Test cricketers: it is claimed that they further incriminate <strong>Azharuddin</strong> and also <strong>Ajay Jadeja</strong>. The police are reportedly under pressure not to hand over the tapes, but are \"standing firm\".</p> <p> <strong>Javed Akhtar</strong>, the Pakistani umpire who made several controversial decisions in the 1998 England-South Africa Test at Headingley and England's World Cup '99 defeat by India, protests his innocence. </p> <p> Two South African umpires disclose they were offered money to match-fix. <strong>Cyril Mitchley</strong> claims he was offered $50,000 to ensure Pakistan did not lose the last of a three-Test series against Australia in 1996. <strong>Rudi Koertzen</strong> says he was approached during a triangular tournament between India, West Indies and Zimbabwe in in Singapore last year.</p> <p><strong>Saturday April 22</strong><br> Unsubstantiated reports suggest that senior Delhi cricketer <strong>Ajay Sharma</strong> acted as a go-between for Azharuddin and bookmakers in Delhi.</p> <p> <strong>Bacher</strong> tells a magazine that the South African judicial commission's report into match-fixing charges against Cronje and others will be submitted by the end of May. He says: \"This thing must not linger on. There must be a finality to it.\"</p> <p><strong>Sunday April 23</strong><br> ICC instruct the Pakistan Board to submit <strong>Judge Qayyum's</strong> match-fixing report in time for their emergency meeting at Lord's on May 2. </p> <p> The Afrikaans-language newspaper Rapport claims that every senior South African player was to sign a contract compelling them to advise the cricket authorities of any approaches made by bookmakers. <strong>Bacher</strong> is quoted as saying that over the years there have been \"too many allegations, too many innuendos about irregularities in the game. We must nip it in the bud.\"</p> <p> <strong>Judge Qayyum</strong> claims his enquiry into Pakistan's defeat to Bangladesh in last year's World Cup was halted by the president of Pakistan. He says \"Initially I was told I should look at the match-fixing without any restrictions ... then I was asked to withdraw. This was very unusual and I was very surprised - anyone would be if you were asked to do something and then told not to three days later.\"</p> <p><strong>Tuesday April 25</strong><br> Former Pakistan captain <strong>Imran Khan</strong> reveals that an Indian bookmaker told him 23 years ago that Indian players were involved in fixing matches. He says: \"He was always at cricket grounds. I never took him seriously. He named a few players. I think he talked about players from another international team - he said they were involved in match-fixing too.\" </p> <p><strong>Wednesday April 26</strong><br> The Pakistan Cricket Board lodges a protest with the UCBSA over comments allegedly made by Bacher. PCB director <strong>Yawar Saeed</strong> says: \"If he [Bacher] accused Pakistan, I will not level a counter-allegation. I will simply ask him to substantiate the allegations.\"</p> <p><strong>Thursday April 27</strong><br> The ECB release a statement from <strong>Gerard Elias QC</strong>, chairman of their discipline committee: \"I conclude that there is no evidence whatsoever to justify the bringing of disciplinary charges in relation to betting and/or match-fixing against any member of the England squad, past or present.\"</p> <p> <strong>Arun Agarwal</strong>, a financial expert who conducted an enquiry into TV deals in India, accuses <strong>Dalmiya</strong> of a \"telecast rights scam\" during TV negotiations for a 1998 one-day tournament in Bangladesh.</p> <p> Indian police issue a warrant for the arrest of <strong>Ajay Sharma</strong>. They claim to have evidence that he made numerous phone calls to bookmakers during South Africa's recent tour of India. <strong>Sharma</strong>, who played 31 ODIs and one Test for India, is currently playing club cricket in Lancashire.</p> <p><strong>Friday April 28</strong><br> <strong>India's government</strong> orders a \"broad-based enquiry\" into all allegations of match-fixing. <strong>Lewis</strong> responds to the ECB's decision to take no further action by suggesting that other players \"might think twice about coming forward\". </p> <p><strong>Saturday April 29</strong><br> <strong>Craig Smith</strong>, the South African team physio, says that Hansie Cronje put \"undue pressure\" on him to declare <strong>Henry Williams</strong> fit before the final match of the ODI series with India. This piles further suspicion on the game at Nagpur in which, as <strong>\"Cronje\"</strong> is alleged to have predicted to Chawla, Williams opened the bowling with offspinner Derek Crookes. Williams broke down in his second over.</p> <p> <strong>Don Topley</strong>, who claimed (in 1994) that the 1991 Championship and Sunday League games between Essex and Lancashire were manipulated, agrees to meet the ECB. At the time, the TCCB refused to listen to Topley's story, and he remains sceptical: \"My concern is that there are some poachers-turned-gamekeepers in cricket, in the media or administration. Whatever happens, it can't be brushed under the carpet.\"</p> <p><strong>Sunday April 30</strong><br> <strong>Dalmiya</strong> files for defamation against <strong>Arun Agarwal</strong>, who alleged that Dalmiya exploited his position for financial gain while president of the Indian Board. <strong>Dalmiya's</strong> solicitor, <strong>UN Banerjee</strong>, describes the comments as \"a conspiracy to tarnish the image and reputation of my client\".</p> <p> The Sunday Times alleges that three Sri Lankans were approached by bookmakers during the home series against Australia in 1992. <strong>Roshan Mahanama</strong>, <strong>Asanka Gurusinha</strong> and <strong>Sanath Jayasuriya</strong> were allegedly offered money for information and forecasting. They refused the money, as did Dean Jones of Australia, who says he was offered $50,000 in a biscuit tin. </p> <p> <strong>Allan Donald</strong> tells the Sunday Telegraph: \"Personally I'd be really annoyed if I find out that I played in a game where Hansie accepted cash. I'll stick with Hansie until he's proven innocent or guilty.

      "bodyText": "Friday April 7 The allegations break. Hansie Cronje, Pieter Strydom, Nicky Boje and Herschelle Gibbs are charged by Indian police with \"cheating, fraud and criminal conspiracy relating to match-fixing and betting\". New Delhi police release transcripts of a conversation thought to be between Cronje and a businessman, Sanjeev Chawla. Strydom, Gibbs and Boje are explicitly mentioned, and \"Cronje\" goes on to say that he cannot \"get\" any more players as \"The other guys are already angry with me because I have not received their money.\" Ali Bacher, managing director of the United Cricket Board of South Africa (UCBSA), defends Cronje's integrity. Cronje says he is innocent of the charges: \"I am stunned. The allegations are completely without substance.\" Jagmohan Dalmiya, the ICC president, announces: \"If there is any grey side to it, we [ICC] will take care of it. We have our own way of working.\" Kepler Wessels (Cronje's predecessor as captain) calls for \"A fully independent and impartial enquiry\". Saturday April 8 Rajesh Kalra, the Indian bookmaker at the centre of the allegations, admits to India Today that he offered players $4-500,000 to fix the one-day series between India and South Africa in March. Krishan Kumar, a former Bollywood actor, is interrogated by Indian police and then admitted to hospital suffering from an angina attack. Sunday April 9 Cronje, Gibbs and Boje hold a press conference. Cronje says he never received money \"during the one-day series in India\" nor spoke to any member of his team about \"throwing a game\". Gibbs says: \"We weren't approached by anybody and Hansie didn't speak to us about the subject.\" Boje adds: \"Hansie never spoke to us about anything to help him in throwing a game.\" The UBCSA president Percy Sonn dismisses the allegations as \"spurious\". A Foreign Ministry spokesman expresses disgust at the tapping of Cronje's phone: \"This goes against all diplomatic norms and is a major invasion of privacy.\" India continues to deny access to the tapes. Trevor Chesterfield, a cricket journalist for the Pretoria Star, says he overheard the tape while waiting to be interviewed on Indian radio, and that it doesn't sound like Cronje. It is later claimed that he heard a reconstruction of the tape, voiced by Indian actors. The Sunday Times reports an experienced Indian crime journalist as saying that KK Paul, the New Delhi police commissioner, was being \"as straight-forward as a police officer can be\". Monday April 10 New Delhi crime branch chief Pradeep Srivastava says he has new \"clinching\" evidence to prove Cronje and Chawla were in contact during the ODIs in India. Interpol confirms that Scotland Yard will be asked to investigate the alleged payments; Indian police want to know Chawla's bank-account details. Kalra tells police that the Kochin ODI was fixed for $300,000, but that the bookies had suffered a big loss when South Africa made over 300. Cronje withdraws from the two upcoming benefit games in aid of Sachin Tendulkar. Bob Woolmer, former SA coach, and Australia's Justin Langer express their support for Cronje. Australian captain Steve Waugh calls for all cheats to be banned from the game. Tuesday April 11 Cronje is sacked from the South African captaincy after he phones Bacher at 3am to admit \"dishonesty\". He is said to have broken down uncontrollably when a friend rang to ask how he was feeling. At a 1pm press conference, Bacher says Cronje admits receiving money during the ODI series with India, but that he denies match-fixing: \"During the England-Zimbabwe triangular series, contact was made with him by a local South African and a bookmaker of Indian origin based in London ... the result was that Cronje was given $10-15,000 which he took home.\" He adds that Cronje had denied being party to match-fixing, but that the UCBSA are \"shattered ... we have been deceived\". Shaun Pollock, who also appears at the press conference, is appointed captain. Simultaneously, Cronje issues a statement through Balfour Ngconde, the sports minister. He denies speaking to any other players about match-fixing, confusingly saying he \"received no financial rewards\". Again he protests that \"the allegations are devoid of all truth\". The ICC call for an \"immediate and thorough investigation\", while Indian police claim they have been vindicated. KK Paul says Kalra has given \"more names\", none Indian, but admits that the police caught Cronje by accident, after he borrowed Kalra's mobile phone. Wednesday April 12 Bacher says he doesn't think any other South African players are involved: \"We have been let down once, and I hope to God we are not let down again.\" Wessels says the damage to SA's cricket is irreparable: \"It is not enough to take the word of the players as the UCB appear to have done.\" Allan Donald admits the affair makes a \"big dent\" in South Africa's achievements. Maite Nkoane-Mashabane, SA's high commissioner to India, says her country is now willing to co-operate with the Indian police \"in any way\". Dalmiya promises a full-scale ICC enquiry, saying \"any attempt to interfere with the fair conduct of sport is totally unacceptable\". The South African findings will go before ICC's Code of Conduct Commission, chaired by Lord Griffiths. Worrying new allegations emerge. Tony Greig, the former England captain, claims there is more to come: \"There are other players involved, Indians as well.\" The Delhi police are investigating a \"much bigger affair\", writes Vinod Mehta in India's Outlook magazine. Inderjit Singh Bindra (former president of the Indian Board) says the Board is hiding important information about Indian players. He claims that three players have been consistently involved in betting since 1996, and that the Board knows who they are. The Board responds by pledging that any player found guilty of match-fixing will be banned for life. England's fifth-Test victory at Centurion in January comes under suspicion. Was Cronje really such a good sport? The fact that a draw was avoided saved the bookies a fortune. Thursday April 13 Match referee Barry Jarman denies that the Centurion Test was fixed. \"There was nothing there to suggest anything had been manufactured,\" he says. He is backed up by Sporting Index, whose chairman insists that it was \"the least likely game ever played\" to have been manipulated, as there was simply \"no time for anything to be contrived between players and bookmakers\". It emerges that the sum Cronje took was $8200. His wife Bertha counted it for the first time in front of lawyers. Bacher says Cronje has not told him what he did to earn the money. Hamid \"Banjo\" Cassim is alleged to be the go-between for Cronje and Chawla. He is also said to know India's recent captains Mohammad Azharuddin and Sachin Tendulkar. In a prepared statement, Cronje says he can't respond fully to the allegations, since the authorities had not yet made clear the basis of the charges. He again denies match-fixing, and says \"speculation and criticism directed against other members of the team is wrong and unjustified\". Indian police announce a hotel link between Cronje, Chawla and Kumar. In February, while Cronje was in Room 811 of Bombay's Taj Hotel, a Sanjeev Chawla stayed in Room 631. His bill was later paid by Kumar. Indian revenue detectives begin a 48-hour interrogation of Kalra. They ask where the \"huge funds\" involved in the match-fixing charges came from, and details of overseas bank accounts. Lance Klusener vehemently denies being the man who tipped off the Delhi police, who confirm he had nothing to do with it. New transcripts throw suspicion on the last game of the five-match ODI series against India at Nagpur in March. The tape has \"Cronje\" saying that he will open the bowling with offspinner Derek Crookes. He did. He also predicts that \"we will be bowling our non-regular bowlers\". Part-time left-armer Strydom bowls a full ten overs. SS Dhindsa, India's sports minister, calls for a report on India's recent poor Test performances (they lost 2-0 at home to South Africa, shortly after being whitewashed 3-0 in Australia). A high-level meeting is arranged for April 27: Azhar, Tendulkar, Kapil Dev and Sourav Ganguly are all summoned. Ray Illingworth reveals that he was approached by a Pakistani book-maker to throw a match during the 1996 World Cup. He was England's manager (and chairman of selectors) at the time. ECB chairman Lord MacLaurin calls for an urgent ICC conference: \"If this were a business, we'd have an emergency board meeting.\" He says that any player in breach of the ICC Code of Conduct should be banned for life. Cronje's sponsors desert him, and a Reserve Bank official tells SA's Citizen newspaper that he could face a $38,000 fine possessing foreign currency. A poll for the Cape Times reveals that 94% of South Africans want Cronje to play international cricket again. Friday April 14 New captain Shaun Pollock dedicates South Africa's victory over Australia in the ODI in Durban (the first game since the scandal broke) to Cronje. Saturday April 15 It emerges that South Africa needed three team meetings before rejecting $250,000 to fix an ODI in India in 1996. It is alleged that only Jonty Rhodes, Andrew Hudson and Dave Richardson were against the idea. \"No-one really wanted to play,\" said Richardson. Gibbs again denies the allegations. He tells the Cape Argus: \"Nothing would make me do something so irresponsible. Nobody approached us. When we were told about it we were terribly shocked.\" Suspicions grow about the Centurion Test. Daryll Cullinan says: \"I would like to think that Hansie was acting in the interest of the game and doing something for the public, but it totally went against the guy I know.\" Derek Crookes admits he was very surprised when Cronje asked him to open the bowling in Nagpur. Cronje had earlier told him he wouldn't open in the series. Sunday April 16 Justice Malik Mohammad Qayyum, the judge who investigated match-fixing allegations in Pakistan, says he \"found rock-solid evidence ... which confirmed some Pakistan players accepted bribes to tamper with the results of international matches.\" He recommended life bans for those players. The ICC is yet to see the report. Azharuddin is implicated. He is named by Kalra, and it emerges that he also knows Cassim. His wife protests his innocence. V Gupta, an income-tax commissioner, says that two months ago an Indian player declared an inexplicably large income of \u00a32million. Chris Lewis claims in the News of the World that when he was approached last summer by Ashim Kheterpal, a sports promoter, he was told that three senior England players were involved in match-fixing. Monday April 17 ICC calls an emergency meeting for May 2-3: \"A summit meeting must be held to consider what further actions must be taken to rid our sport of this major problem,\" says Dalmiya. Michael Parkinson writes in the Daily Telegraph: \"It is time for the ICC to start acting like a governing body instead of a seedy public-relations agency.\" Tuesday April 18 Lewis meets ECB officials to give them the names of the three players he'd been told were involved. The ECB pass the information on to the police for thorough investigation, although Gareth James, Lewis's agent, says the names were given to the police last September. Azharuddin and Tendulkar both emphatically deny any match-fixing. Azhar says all the allegations are \"false, untrue, baseless and of no substance\"; Tendulkar says he has followed his \"conscience and duty\" and \"stayed clear from all undesirable elements\". Andy Flower, Zimbabwe's captain, says he has long suspected \"shenanigans\" in some competitions. He says: \"There have been instances I thought the opposition did not quite look themselves.\" Wednesday April 19 Lewis claims that the ECB were \"not interested\" when he offered to pass on players' names last summer. IS Bindra says \"Hansie Cronje has emerged as the biggest hero in this episode. It is Hansie who is going to save world cricket and nobody else.\" He then claims that \"virtually every game in international cricket is fixed\". Kapil Dev, now India's coach, calls for cricket to \"stop\" until the allegations have been dealt with. Bacher claims that two of last year's World Cup matches were fixed, and that he has been told that an international umpire was involved with bookmakers. Thursday April 20 Ashim Kheterpal rejects Lewis's claims and dismisses him as a \"fraud\". Bombay police reveal they have more tape-recordings of phone conversations between bookies and Test cricketers: it is claimed that they further incriminate Azharuddin and also Ajay Jadeja. The police are reportedly under pressure not to hand over the tapes, but are \"standing firm\". Javed Akhtar, the Pakistani umpire who made several controversial decisions in the 1998 England-South Africa Test at Headingley and England's World Cup '99 defeat by India, protests his innocence. Two South African umpires disclose they were offered money to match-fix. Cyril Mitchley claims he was offered $50,000 to ensure Pakistan did not lose the last of a three-Test series against Australia in 1996. Rudi Koertzen says he was approached during a triangular tournament between India, West Indies and Zimbabwe in in Singapore last year. Saturday April 22 Unsubstantiated reports suggest that senior Delhi cricketer Ajay Sharma acted as a go-between for Azharuddin and bookmakers in Delhi. Bacher tells a magazine that the South African judicial commission's report into match-fixing charges against Cronje and others will be submitted by the end of May. He says: \"This thing must not linger on. There must be a finality to it.\" Sunday April 23 ICC instruct the Pakistan Board to submit Judge Qayyum's match-fixing report in time for their emergency meeting at Lord's on May 2. The Afrikaans-language newspaper Rapport claims that every senior South African player was to sign a contract compelling them to advise the cricket authorities of any approaches made by bookmakers. Bacher is quoted as saying that over the years there have been \"too many allegations, too many innuendos about irregularities in the game. We must nip it in the bud.\" Judge Qayyum claims his enquiry into Pakistan's defeat to Bangladesh in last year's World Cup was halted by the president of Pakistan. He says \"Initially I was told I should look at the match-fixing without any restrictions ... then I was asked to withdraw. This was very unusual and I was very surprised - anyone would be if you were asked to do something and then told not to three days later.\" Tuesday April 25 Former Pakistan captain Imran Khan reveals that an Indian bookmaker told him 23 years ago that Indian players were involved in fixing matches. He says: \"He was always at cricket grounds. I never took him seriously. He named a few players. I think he talked about players from another international team - he said they were involved in match-fixing too.\" Wednesday April 26 The Pakistan Cricket Board lodges a protest with the UCBSA over comments allegedly made by Bacher. PCB director Yawar Saeed says: \"If he [Bacher] accused Pakistan, I will not level a counter-allegation. I will simply ask him to substantiate the allegations.\" Thursday April 27 The ECB release a statement from Gerard Elias QC, chairman of their discipline committee: \"I conclude that there is no evidence whatsoever to justify the bringing of disciplinary charges in relation to betting and/or match-fixing against any member of the England squad, past or present.\" Arun Agarwal, a financial expert who conducted an enquiry into TV deals in India, accuses Dalmiya of a \"telecast rights scam\" during TV negotiations for a 1998 one-day tournament in Bangladesh. Indian police issue a warrant for the arrest of Ajay Sharma. They claim to have evidence that he made numerous phone calls to bookmakers during South Africa's recent tour of India. Sharma, who played 31 ODIs and one Test for India, is currently playing club cricket in Lancashire. Friday April 28 India's government orders a \"broad-based enquiry\" into all allegations of match-fixing. Lewis responds to the ECB's decision to take no further action by suggesting that other players \"might think twice about coming forward\". Saturday April 29 Craig Smith, the South African team physio, says that Hansie Cronje put \"undue pressure\" on him to declare Henry Williams fit before the final match of the ODI series with India. This piles further suspicion on the game at Nagpur in which, as \"Cronje\" is alleged to have predicted to Chawla, Williams opened the bowling with offspinner Derek Crookes. Williams broke down in his second over. Don Topley, who claimed (in 1994) that the 1991 Championship and Sunday League games between Essex and Lancashire were manipulated, agrees to meet the ECB. At the time, the TCCB refused to listen to Topley's story, and he remains sceptical: \"My concern is that there are some poachers-turned-gamekeepers in cricket, in the media or administration. Whatever happens, it can't be brushed under the carpet.\" Sunday April 30 Dalmiya files for defamation against Arun Agarwal, who alleged that Dalmiya exploited his position for financial gain while president of the Indian Board. Dalmiya's solicitor, UN Banerjee, describes the comments as \"a conspiracy to tarnish the image and reputation of my client\". The Sunday Times alleges that three Sri Lankans were approached by bookmakers during the home series against Australia in 1992. Roshan Mahanama, Asanka Gurusinha and Sanath Jayasuriya were allegedly offered money for information and forecasting. They refused the money, as did Dean Jones of Australia, who says he was offered $50,000 in a biscuit tin. Allan Donald tells the Sunday Telegraph: \"Personally I'd be really annoyed if I find out that I played in a game where Hansie accepted cash. I'll stick with Hansie until he's proven innocent or guilty. But if he's proved guilty, he's going to have no sympathy; he will have to start running miles.\" Monday May 1 Manoj Prabhakar, the former Indian allrounder, claims to have told \"a big gun in the government\" the name of the team-mate who offered him money to throw a match during the 1994 Singer Cup series in Sri Lanka. Tuesday May 2 The ICC's emergency executive-board meeting begins at Lord's. Speaking beforehand, Lord MacLaurin promises that the investigation will be \"from the president down\". All 18 members of the executive board are made to sign a declaration stating that they have no financial interest in cricket, other than what is already public knowledge. Dalmiya is cleared of malpractice by the ICC. David Richards, the ICC chief executive, calls on IS Bindra to make a formal written submission to the governing body's solicitors outlining his match-fixing allegations. Bindra claims to have 100 pages of information and names relating to corruption. Wednesday May 3 ICC announces a number of measures aimed at tackling corruption, including possible life bans for anyone found guilty of match-fixing. Also: \u0095 Any country failing to co-operate with the Code of Conduct Commission, under Lord Griffiths, will be suspended; Judge Qayyum's investigation into Pakistani match-fixing must be released within five weeks. \u0095 Every international player, umpire, referee, team official, administrator and employee will have to sign a declaration stating whether they have been encour-aged to engage in corrupt behaviour. \u0095 Registration systems are to be standardised to ensure players are made aware of the ICC's code of conduct and what it deems \"unacceptable behaviour\". \u0095 An independent anti-corruption investigation will be set up in time for the full ICC meeting in July. It will be led by a \"senior experienced\" legal figure and will be granted wide-ranging powers. Lord MacLaurin admits that he believes corruption has infiltrated the international arena, and reiterates the authorities' commitment to \"root it out\". He promises to make an example of anyone found guilty of corruption by \"kicking them out of the game for good\". Thursday May 4 Judge Edwin King is named to lead South Africa's investi-gation into the Cronje affair. King, 71, was born in London and describes himself as a \"cricket nut\". In a televised interview with CNN, IS Bindra alleges that Kapil Dev offered Manoj Prabhakar $25,000 to underperform in an ODI against Sri Lanka in 1994. Friday May 5 Kapil Dev denies Bindra's allegations and instructs his lawyers to take action. He also calls for India to withdraw from the Asia Cup in Bangladesh (starts May 28). This is rejected by the Indian Board. Salim Malik rejects reports that he is to flee Pakistan before Qayyum's report is published: \"I will remain in Pakistan until all the enquires clear me.\" Sanjeev Chawla, the British businessman alleged to be at the centre of the Cronje scandal, breaks his silence: \"I have never met Hansie Cronje and certainly never given him any money ... My whole life is being ruined.\" Police in Delhi have already arrested two men thought to have been working with Chawla, and are keen to examine his bank accounts in Britain. Saturday May 6 The ACB announce that they will appoint an independent investigator to examine the allegations of match-fixing and bribery, but rule out a review of the Shane Warne and Mark Waugh case. Kapil Dev serves a legal notice on Bindra for naming him as the player who tried to bribe Prabhakar: \"[My] reputation built up over 25 years has been tarnished by one irresponsible statement.\" Sunday May 7 Kapil Dev weeps during a BBC interview, in which he says he would rather commit suicide than take a bribe. Imran Khan criticises ICC for pressurising the Pakistan Board to release their report on match-fixing, while letting the ACB get away with concealing facts about the Warne-Waugh affair. Monday May 8 Edwin King, head of the South African government-appointed enquiry, tells the press that his is not a criminal investigation, but seeks only to discover the truth. But, King adds, he will subpoena witnesses if necessary. Compiled by Alistair Rycroft, Catherine Hanley and Simon Byrne",

The company has dominated the local economy for <a href=\"http://www.research.philips.com/generalinfo/historical/index.html\" target=\"_new\">more than 70 years</a>.</p> <p>4. Philips is closely associated with the city's other main product, the football club <a href=\"http://www.psv.nl\" target=\"_new\">PSV Eindhoven</a>. It has a worldwide following, not least <a href=\"http://www.soccer-links.com/psv.htm\" target=\"_new\">on the internet</a>.</p> <p>5. Eindhoven prides itself on being a <a href=\"http://dse.iaehv.nl\" target=\"_new\">digital city</a>, and is home to an unusual number of unusual websites, including one which will keenly interest collectors of <a href=\"http://www.stempelmakers.com/welcome/catalog/index.html\" target=\"_new\">rubber stamps</a>.</p> <p>6.

The company has dominated the local economy for more than 70 years. 4. Philips is closely associated with the city's other main product, the football club PSV Eindhoven. It has a worldwide following, not least on the internet. 5. Eindhoven prides itself on being a digital city, and is home to an unusual number of unusual websites, including one which will keenly interest collectors of rubber stamps. 6. Other minority interests are well catered for. Model enthusiasts will find much to entertain them at WillieS, while vintage aeroplane buffs will doubtless enjoy the eclectic joys of the Philips symphony orchestra, which bills itself as the most downloaded music site in Europe. 7. Oddly enough, the Odd Fellows also flourish in Eindhoven. 8. Visitors with more conventional tastes are sure to be entertained at the Cafe Sante. 9. England fans are unlikely to have language problems, given that most Dutch people speak rather better English than we do. And decyphering Dutch is not that difficult, as you will find by browsing the latest news in Eindhovens Dagblat. 10. Over the moon or sick as a parrot, footie followers can be assured that Eindhoven offers a quick way home.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>British journalists - and British journals - are being manipulated by the secret intelligence agencies, and I think we ought to try and put a stop to it. </p> <p>The manipulation takes three forms. The first is the attempt to recruit journalists to spy on other people, or to go themselves under journalistic \"cover\". This occurs today and it has gone on for years. It is dangerous, not only for the journalist concerned, but for other journalists who get tarred with the espionage brush. Farzad Bazoft was a colleague of mine on the Observer when he was executed by Saddam Hussein for espionage. In a sense it didn't matter whether he was really a spy or not. Either way, he ended up dead. </p> <p>The second form of manipulation that worries me is when intelligence officers are allowed to pose as journalists in order to write tendentious articles under false names. Evidence of this only rarely comes to light, but two examples have surfaced recently, mainly because of the whistleblowing activities of a couple of renegade officers - David Shayler from MI5 and Richard Tomlinson from MI6. </p> <p>The third sort of manipulation is the most insidious - when intelligence agency propaganda stories are planted on willing journalists, who disguise their origin from their readers. There is - or has been until recently - a very active programme by the secret agencies to colour what appears in the British press, called, if publications by various defectors can be believed, information operations, or \"I/Ops\". I am - unusually - in a position to provide some information about its operations. </p> <p>Let us take the third allegation first. Black propaganda - false material where the source is disguised - has been a tool of British intelligence agencies since the days of the second world war, when the Special Operations Executive (SOE) got up to all kinds of tricks with clandestine radio stations, to drip pornography and pessimism into the ears of impressionable German soldiers. Post-war, this unwholesome game mutated into the anti-Soviet Information Research Department (IRD). Its task was ostensibly to plant anti-communist stories in the developing-world press, but its lurid tales of Marxist drunkenness and corruption sometimes leaked back to confuse the readers of the British media. </p> <p>A colourful example of the way these techniques expanded to meet the exigencies of the hour came in the early 70s, when the readers of the News of the World were treated to a front-page splash, \"Russian sub in IRA plot sensation\", complete with aerial photograph of the conning tower of a Soviet sub awash off the coast of Donegal. That was the work of Hugh Mooney of the IRD, which was eventually closed down in 1977. </p> <p>Its spirit did not die, however. Nearly 25 years later, readers of the Sunday Telegraph were regaled with with the dramatic story of the son of Libya's Colonel Gadafy and his alleged connection to a currency counterfeiting plan. The story was written by Con Coughlin, the paper's chief foreign correspondent and it was falsely attributed to a \"British banking official\". In fact, it had been given to him by officers of MI6, who, it transpired, had been supplying Coughlin with material for years. </p> <p>The origins of that November 1995 newspaper article only came to light when they were recently disclosed by Mark Hollingsworth, the biographer of renegade security service officer David Shayler. Shayler had worked on MI5's Libya desk at the time, in liaison with his counterparts in the foreign espionage service, MI6, and had come away with a detailed knowledge of events, and a bundle of secret documents to back them up. </p> <p>The allegations were confirmed from an unexpected direction. The Sunday Telegraph was served with a libel writ by Gadafy's son. The paper was unable to back up its suggestion that Gadafy junior might have been linked to a fraud, but pleaded, in effect, that it had been supplied with the material by the government. </p> <p>In a long and detailed statement, which entered the public domain in the course of a judgment given in an interlocutory appeal on October 28 1998, the paper described how, under Charles Moore's editorship, a lunch had been arranged with the then Conservative foreign secretary, Malcolm Rifkind, at which Con Coughlin had been present. Told by Rifkind that countries such as Iran were trying to get hold of hard currency to beat sanctions, Coughlin was later briefed by an MI6 man - his regular contact. </p> <p>Some weeks later, he was introduced to a second MI6 man, who spent several hours with him and handed over extensive details of the story about Gadafy's son. Although Coughlin asked for evidence, and was shown purported bank statements, the pleadings make clear that he was dependent on MI6 for the discreditable details about the alleged counterfeiting scam. He was required to keep the source strictly confidential. </p> <p>Throughout the formal pleadings, the Telegraph preserved the figleaf of its sources by referring to a \"Western government security agency\". But this veil of coyness was blown away by City solicitor David Hooper in his book on libel published last month, Reputations Under Fire, in which he says: \"In reality [they were] members of MI6.\" </p> <p>So, unusually, an MI6 exercise in planting a story has been laid bare. Now, there is no suggestion that Con Coughlin is dishonest in his work. He is a perfectly conscientious journalist who I expect did his best to substantiate his facts and undoubtedly believed in their truth. But nevertheless, those facts may not have been true. And I believe he made a serious mistake in falsely attributing his story to a \"British banking official\". His readers ought to know where his material is coming from. When the Sunday Telegraph got into trouble with the libel case, it seems, after all, to have suddenly found it possible to become a lot more specific about its sources. </p> <p>This was not an isolated example of recent MI6 I/Ops. In August 1997, the present foreign editor of the Independent, Leonard Doyle, was also in contact with MI6 while he was at his previous post at the Observer. I know, because I became involved in an MI6-inspired story as a result. Doyle's MI6 contact supplied him with intelligence information about an Iranian exile who, while running a pizza business in Glasgow, was also attempting to lay hands on a sophisticated mass spectrometer which could be used for measuring uranium enrichment - a key stage in acquiring components for a nuclear bomb. </p> <p>We were supplied with a mass of apparently high-quality intelligence from MI6, including surveillance details of a meeting in an Istanbul hotel between our pizza merchant and men involved in Iranian nuclear procurement. </p> <p>I should make clear that we did not publish merely on the say-so of MI6. We travelled to Glasgow, confronted the pizza merchant, and only when he admitted that he had been dealing with representatives of the nuclear industry in Iran did we publish an article. In that story we made it plain that our target had been watched by Western intelligence. </p> <p>Nevertheless, I felt uneasy, and vowed never to take part in such an exercise again. Although all parties, from the foreign editor down, behaved scrupulously, we had been obliged to conceal from our readers the full facts and had ended up, in effect, acting as government agents. </p> <p>Now, after the Tomlinson/Shayler defections and the subsequent revelation of MI6's continuing I/Ops programme of which my Iranian experience was plainly a part, I think the cause of honest journalism is best served by candour. We all ought to come clean about these approaches, and devise some ethics to deal with them. In our vanity, we imagine that we control these sources. But the truth is that they are very deliberately seeking to control us. </p> <p>The second intelligence tactic of manipulation which gives concern is the habit of allowing spies to write under false names. It was Tomlinson, I suspect, who, having worked in the area, first blew the whistle on this one. And it was a recently published book - MI6 by Stephen Dorril - which once again added the final piece of the jigsaw. </p> <p>Two articles appeared in the Spectator in early 1994 under the byline Kenneth Roberts. They were datelined Sarajevo, and Roberts was described as having been working with the UN in Bosnia as an adviser. In fact, he was MI6 officer Keith Robert Craig (the pseudonym was a simple one), whose local cover was as a civilian \"attached\" to the British military unit's Balkan secretariat. </p> <p>At the time, Bosnia was the site of attacks and atrocities from neighbouring Serbia, and also the focus of some passionate reporting from British journalists. The British military was there in a UN peacekeeping role, but anyone who read Roberts's articles might have begun to wonder whether it was not a better policy for British troops to go home and leave the Serbs a free hand. </p> <p>The first article on February 5 rehearsed arguments for a UN withdrawal, pointing out that all sides committed atrocities. The second piece complained, baselessly, about \"warped\" and inaccurate reporting by journalists, including the BBC's Kate Adie. </p> <p>It is possible, of course, that Craig was merely overcome with private literary urges whilst marooned in the Balkans, and thought it more politic to express his own opinions under a nom de plume . But one of the traditional roles of I/Ops is to plant stories. What is not clear is how the introduction to the Spectator was made, or whether Craig confided his real trade to the then editor of the Spectator, Dominic Lawson. In his recent book about MI6, Stephen Dorril points out that Dominic Lawson's brother-in-law, Anthony Monckton, was himself a serving MI6 officer, who was to take over the Zagreb station in the Balkans in 1996. (Rosa Monckton, his sister and Dominic Lawson's wife, was the late Princess Diana's close friend.) </p> <p>These relationships - which the disenchanted Tomlinson knew all about because he had himself served undercover in the Balkans in the same time-frame - have only slowly emerged into the public domain. There is no reason to believe the then editor of the Spectator did anything improper at all, and certainly no reason to think that he was acting as an agent of MI6, whether paid or unpaid. But, as an editor, wittingly or not, it must be a bad idea to end up in a position where an MI6 officer is writing for your publication on matters of political controversy, under a false name. </p> <p>The final malpractice which the Tomlinson/Shayler defections have brought to light is the continuing deliberate blurring by MI6 of the line between journalist and spy. This is an old crime - Kim Philby, former foreign correspondent of the Observer would have had plenty of stories to tell about that. But it should be exposed and stopped. Tomlinson himself, by his own account, spent six months in 1993 travelling around Croatia and Serbia trying to recruit informants, under the guise of a British journalist. Dorril, in his book, publishes the further assertion that the Spectator itself was unknowingly used as cover by no fewer than three MI6 officers working in Bosnia, Belgrade and Moldova. </p> <p>The most dismaying allegation floated by Tomlinson was that he had heard within MI6 of a \"national newspaper editor\" who was used as an agent, and had received up to \u00a3100,000 in covert payments, accessed at an offshore bank, via a false passport obligingly supplied by MI6 itself. This claim set off a hue and cry, during which the hapless Dominic Lawson, now editor of the Sunday Telegraph, issued his denial, and other editors came under suspicious scrutiny. </p> <p>In fact, I believe Tomlinson has been wrongly reported. Those who have talked to him in detail say that he has no first-hand knowledge, but merely knew of something a colleague obliquely mentioned. Hearing the words \"editor\" and \"national newspaper\", Tomlinson jumped to the wrong conclusion, and then started guessing. Spies are, after all, very like journalists in their methods - but merely less reliable. What those in the newspaper business know is that there is all the difference in the world between \"the editor\" and \"an editor\". Newspapers have, for example, education editors, environment editors and defence editors (not, I should say, that I have any evidence against any individual members of these categories). </p> <p>And a senior journalist at that level - who could travel, see things, report back - would be of more practical use in the business of espionage than, say, the editor of any national newspaper. So the hunt is still on for the miscreant. And, make no mistake, this kind of behaviour by journalists is dangerous and wrong. </p> <p>Our first task as practitioners is to document what goes on in this very furtive field. Our second task ought to be to hold an open debate on what the proper relations between the intelligence agencies and the media ought to be. And our final task must then be to find ways of actually behaving more sensibly. </p> <p>This article appears in the current edition of the British Journalism Review.

Although all parties, from the foreign editor down, behaved scrupulously, we had been obliged to conceal from our readers the full facts and had ended up, in effect, acting as government agents. Now, after the Tomlinson/Shayler defections and the subsequent revelation of MI6's continuing I/Ops programme of which my Iranian experience was plainly a part, I think the cause of honest journalism is best served by candour. We all ought to come clean about these approaches, and devise some ethics to deal with them. In our vanity, we imagine that we control these sources. But the truth is that they are very deliberately seeking to control us. The second intelligence tactic of manipulation which gives concern is the habit of allowing spies to write under false names. It was Tomlinson, I suspect, who, having worked in the area, first blew the whistle on this one. And it was a recently published book - MI6 by Stephen Dorril - which once again added the final piece of the jigsaw. Two articles appeared in the Spectator in early 1994 under the byline Kenneth Roberts. They were datelined Sarajevo, and Roberts was described as having been working with the UN in Bosnia as an adviser. In fact, he was MI6 officer Keith Robert Craig (the pseudonym was a simple one), whose local cover was as a civilian \"attached\" to the British military unit's Balkan secretariat. At the time, Bosnia was the site of attacks and atrocities from neighbouring Serbia, and also the focus of some passionate reporting from British journalists. The British military was there in a UN peacekeeping role, but anyone who read Roberts's articles might have begun to wonder whether it was not a better policy for British troops to go home and leave the Serbs a free hand. The first article on February 5 rehearsed arguments for a UN withdrawal, pointing out that all sides committed atrocities. The second piece complained, baselessly, about \"warped\" and inaccurate reporting by journalists, including the BBC's Kate Adie. It is possible, of course, that Craig was merely overcome with private literary urges whilst marooned in the Balkans, and thought it more politic to express his own opinions under a nom de plume . But one of the traditional roles of I/Ops is to plant stories. What is not clear is how the introduction to the Spectator was made, or whether Craig confided his real trade to the then editor of the Spectator, Dominic Lawson. In his recent book about MI6, Stephen Dorril points out that Dominic Lawson's brother-in-law, Anthony Monckton, was himself a serving MI6 officer, who was to take over the Zagreb station in the Balkans in 1996. (Rosa Monckton, his sister and Dominic Lawson's wife, was the late Princess Diana's close friend.) These relationships - which the disenchanted Tomlinson knew all about because he had himself served undercover in the Balkans in the same time-frame - have only slowly emerged into the public domain. There is no reason to believe the then editor of the Spectator did anything improper at all, and certainly no reason to think that he was acting as an agent of MI6, whether paid or unpaid. But, as an editor, wittingly or not, it must be a bad idea to end up in a position where an MI6 officer is writing for your publication on matters of political controversy, under a false name. The final malpractice which the Tomlinson/Shayler defections have brought to light is the continuing deliberate blurring by MI6 of the line between journalist and spy. This is an old crime - Kim Philby, former foreign correspondent of the Observer would have had plenty of stories to tell about that. But it should be exposed and stopped. Tomlinson himself, by his own account, spent six months in 1993 travelling around Croatia and Serbia trying to recruit informants, under the guise of a British journalist. Dorril, in his book, publishes the further assertion that the Spectator itself was unknowingly used as cover by no fewer than three MI6 officers working in Bosnia, Belgrade and Moldova. The most dismaying allegation floated by Tomlinson was that he had heard within MI6 of a \"national newspaper editor\" who was used as an agent, and had received up to \u00a3100,000 in covert payments, accessed at an offshore bank, via a false passport obligingly supplied by MI6 itself. This claim set off a hue and cry, during which the hapless Dominic Lawson, now editor of the Sunday Telegraph, issued his denial, and other editors came under suspicious scrutiny. In fact, I believe Tomlinson has been wrongly reported. Those who have talked to him in detail say that he has no first-hand knowledge, but merely knew of something a colleague obliquely mentioned. Hearing the words \"editor\" and \"national newspaper\", Tomlinson jumped to the wrong conclusion, and then started guessing. Spies are, after all, very like journalists in their methods - but merely less reliable. What those in the newspaper business know is that there is all the difference in the world between \"the editor\" and \"an editor\". Newspapers have, for example, education editors, environment editors and defence editors (not, I should say, that I have any evidence against any individual members of these categories). And a senior journalist at that level - who could travel, see things, report back - would be of more practical use in the business of espionage than, say, the editor of any national newspaper. So the hunt is still on for the miscreant. And, make no mistake, this kind of behaviour by journalists is dangerous and wrong. Our first task as practitioners is to document what goes on in this very furtive field. Our second task ought to be to hold an open debate on what the proper relations between the intelligence agencies and the media ought to be. And our final task must then be to find ways of actually behaving more sensibly. This article appears in the current edition of the British Journalism Review.

One of the most experienced royal press officers, handling a delicate - but, let's be honest, fairly routine - photographic deal goes about it in the most ham-fisted way imaginable. </p> <p>On the other side is Fleet Street's greatest champion of journalistic ethics and lecturer to tabloids about the dangers of turning the royal family into a commodity, trying to make a commercial killing from a set of pictures. </p> <p>Add to that the fact that it all came to light just days before the chairman of the press complaints commission (PCC) was to make a public statement praising editors for their sensitive treatment of Prince William in the past and urging yet more tolerance in future, and you have a public relations cock-up of memorable proportions. </p> <p>By Friday, the Prince of Wales's press secretary, Sandy Henney, had departed in ignominy from her post, Daily Telegraph editor Charles Moore had lost his exclusive, rival editors were still steaming, and PCC chairman Lord Wakeham had postponed his setpiece speech indefinitely. </p> <p>First, the facts. Henney and her press team at St James's Palace decided to ensure that newspapers would have a set of pictures of Prince William to mark his 18th birthday, on June 21. As usual, to avoid packs of cameramen surrounding the prince, a single photographer was selected on the understanding that two sets of his resulting pictures, once approved by William and his advisers, would be pooled. One set was destined, under embargo, for the dailies and another for the Sundays. </p> <p>For reasons she has yet to explain in public, Henney gave this assignment, with its unprecedented access to the prince at Eton, to Ian Jones, a freelance photographer contracted to the Daily Telegraph. There were two other oddities in the agreement. First, Jones would retain the copyright to all the approved pictures. Second, there would be extra approved pictures quite separate from those chosen for the two pooled sets. </p> <p>Rival photographers, though unaware of the detailed arrangements, are used to the pooling system. But they were unhappy at what they believed to be yet another example of favouritism shown to the Telegraph by St James's Palace. Just two weeks ago, during the Dunkirk commemoration, journalists were told there was space only for two of them aboard the prince's aircraft for a flight to Caen. Telegraph writer Robert Hardman and photographer Jones got the seats. </p> <p>Delighted that Jones was taking the William pictures, Telegraph editor Moore quickly realised that he might be able to exploit the situation for his paper's benefit. So, on May 2, Henney agreed with Jones that he could give his pictures to the Telegraph weeks before their release to other papers in order that they could be published in the paper's glossy Saturday magazine on June 17. </p> <p>Better still for Moore, with Jones holding the copyright to a number of approved pictures which wouldn't be available to his rivals, he would be able to publish exclusive shots. Saturday is already the Telegraph's best-selling day. Here was a chance to increase his circulation still further with a genuine scoop. Remarkably, none of this complex deal, with perhaps as much as \u00a31m at stake, was enshrined in a written contract. But nothing ever remains secret for long in Fleet Street. </p> <p>By last week the Daily Mail got wind of what was happening and, soon after, so did News International's papers at Wapping. Editors were furious at Henney's extraordinary decision-making. At best they thought her guilty of naivety; at worst, they accused her of duplicity. Most were also furious with Moore. Though they conceded that they too might have acted in a similar fashion given half the chance, they were amazed that Moore, of all people, should seek to take commercial advantage of Prince William. In the wake of Princess Diana's death, it was Moore who demanded that the tabloids be brought to heel, castigating them in public and doing all he could in private to amend the editors' code of practice to an acceptable level. </p> <p>But Moore, even if somewhat embarrassed, was not going to give in easily. As Henney's bosses realised what she had done and demanded that Jones's pictures be released to the complaining Mail and News International, to allow them to compete with the Telegraph, Moore threatened to issue a writ. Later, after diplomacy involving the PCC, he withdrew the threat and then reluctantly agreed that he wouldn't publish pictures which were not available to his rivals. He had lost, and he issued an angry statement laying all the blame at the door of St James's Palace and accusing the Prince's private secretary, Stephen Lamport, of reneging on previous agreements. In fact, Lamport could not have done otherwise. Offending the Telegraph was the lesser of two evils. He knew the result of holding fast to the Henney-Jones deal would be wrecking the good relationship built up over the past four years with the rest of Fleet Street. </p> <p>There remained the outstanding problem of copyright being vested in Jones, who markets his pictures through Frank Spooner's agency. On Friday afternoon, its managing director, Michael Soulsby, said unequivocally: \"As far as we are concerned, we have obtained permission from the Palace to sell these pictures.\" </p> <p>His agency considered that the agreement made between Jones and Henney was still valid. But with Henney having resigned - in the words of a Palace spokesman, \"having done the honourable thing\"- Jones followed suit. He handed back to the Prince of Wales the copyright in his pictures, foregoing considerable profits. </p> <p>There are many lessons to learn from this sorry saga. The most obvious, of course, is that St James's Palace needs to create a totally new approach to press relations on behalf of Prince William. Newspapers are so competitive, each one vying for advantage over the other, that they must have complete confidence that the Palace will operate on a level playing field. Just because the Daily Telegraph is the preferred reading of princes and generally behaves with due deference, it cannot enjoy either commercial or operational favouritism. </p> <p>Agreements made with photographers and papers, especially when copyright is involved, should be in the form of legal contracts. </p> <p>But the greatest lesson of all is the realisation that William is going to be, whether he likes it or not, a subject of intense media fascination for the rest of his life. He is his mother's son in more ways than one. If the Daily Telegraph of all papers thought it could sell extra copies by using his image, imagine what the Daily Mail, Sun and Mirror are thinking. Desperate to replace Diana as a guaranteed sales winner, newspapers and magazines are sure that they can reverse their circulations' slides by publishing pictures of the prince. The market has no morality. </p> <p>Knowing that, Wakeham was undoubtedly going to offer practical and ethical advice to editors in his now-deferred speech. His central problem is to assure the prince a measure of privacy while allowing the press to exercise its freedom. It was relatively easy to find that balance while William was at Eton because all school children, irrespective of their parentage, are protected from intrusion under the editors' code of practice. </p> <p>As the pictures fiasco illustrates, now comes the really difficult, and potentially fraught, period when newspapers will be asked to act responsibly. They must avoid treating the prince as \"fair game\" while, for his part, Prince William must understand that he cannot be wrapped in cotton wool. To this end, Wakeham will need to remind editors that they must obey the code both in letter and spirit. Perhaps the most obvious, but most overlooked, point is the need for accuracy. Stories about the royal family are notorious for their factual errors, reliance on quotes from anonymous sources and wildly speculative flights of fancy. </p> <p>William has already suffered that kind of nonsense. By coincidence, the Sunday Express yesterday published a PCC adjudication upholding a complaint by the father of a 19-year-old blonde girl \"tipped to be Prince William's wife\". Though the paper quoted \"royal insiders\" as saying the couple had \"formed a close bond\" the prince had never met Isabella Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe. Sadly, given that truth is supposed to form the cornerstone of journalism, Wakeham will need to reinforce that basic tenet in his speech because inaccuracy all too often leads to intrusion. </p> <p>That takes us on to the more subjective problem of defining what should and should not be private. Since, in a recent ruling, the PCC decided that Moors murderer Ian Brady was entitled to privacy, then the prince must enjoy the same privilege. </p> <p>Finally, and here surely is the real test, Wakeham must reinforce the clause about harassment which was drawn up following Diana's death.

This is no mean feat in the face of ferocious competition: Sky One runs Pok\u00e9mon cartoons from 3.30-5pm every weekday, directly against the terrestrial channels' kids' zones. </p> <p>ITV's turnaround has been orchestrated by Nigel Pickard, who joined the ITV Network Centre in 1998 and took forceful command of CITV's \u00a345m budget and 11 hours of weekly programming. Cynics told him the job would be short-term: ITV would be ditching TV for kids as fast as it could and courting \"yoof\" instead. Domestic production would be swamped by global forces, led by the $2.1bn invested annually in American children's programming. </p> <p>Instead, with just two assistants, but strong backing from ITV programme director David Liddiment, Pickard proved the power of positive thinking, providing a rallying-point for children's TV producers. He introduced a stripped schedule boasting long runs of original, exclusive-to-ITV programming, only partly copying cable and satellite. He devised a long-term strategy for winning Saturdays, accepting that SMTV Live would take a year to bed in, and launched a fistful of new shows, including British animation made with partners. </p> <p>\"He is very good news. Before he arrived, CITV was in the doldrums,\" says a key official. And now Pickard, 48, who has spent all his life in commercial TV, has been poached by the BBC, to repeat his ITV feats and more. He is Greg Dyke's first major signing, installed in the reorganised BBC's new tier of powerful \"budget- holder\" commissioners, who are as capable of commissioning programmes as channel controllers. </p> <p>He has been handed the best job in children's TV - controller of CBBC, a newly integrated children's department (reuniting 220 production staff with schedulers) responsible for 30 hours of output each week on BBC1 and BBC2. Part of his remit is \"developing the proposition\" of a public service BBC channel for the under-12s, a project on the launch pad awaiting a green light. If it gets Department of Culture approval, it could be on air late this year or early next. Pickard is said to think the BBC should launch two networks, not dissimilar to the Nickelodeon/Nick Jr model - one for pre-school children, another for the 6-to-12s. </p> <p>In the context of the vociferous debate about public service broadcasting, the role of children's TV is key - especially to the BBC. Children's TV is a defining element of a public service mix and it's become axiomatic that children should have access to programmes which are made specifically for them and do not exploit them. </p> <p>Though Pickard, a shrewd, genial figure who attributes much of his success to common sense, is lying low at his home in Kent, the clues to what he brings to CBBC are clear. The basic analysis is that CBBC is not punching its weight. It could be a global force. Blue Peter is performing as well as ever, but as a brand it is hardly exploited: no books or clubs. Its dramas, such as last year's Pig Heart Boy and the Bafta winner See How They Run, remain challenging and of the highest quality. But other opportunities are missed: Microsoap, a breakthrough portrayal of dysfunctional family life which influenced Granada's My Parents are Aliens, has been allowed to die. </p> <p> Presentation has become laboured: everyone knew Zo\u00eb Ball and Jamie Theakston were quitting Live &amp; Kicking, for example, but their departure still left a glaring gap. More generally, there has been drift and a lack of leadership since the extraordinary success of Teletubbies. \"What you need is someone to champion CBBC,\" says a key source. </p> <p>Greg Dyke first crossed paths with Pickard when he became director of programmes at TVS in 1984, after performing his famous rescue act at TV-am. Based in Southampton, TVS had built on what it inherited from Southern, the previous licence-holder, to become ITV's biggest supplier of children's programming. Many of the biggest talents in British children's TV worked there. To his surprise, Pickard was promoted by Dyke over several more senior producers to become controller of children's programming in 1986, when Anna Home left TVS to run children's television . . . for the BBC. </p> <p>His roots go deep: he worked as an assistant producer on Worzel Gummidge in the 1970s, and was involved in a long list of other hits - Art Attack, Motor Mouth, How To . . ., What's Up Doc?, Mr Majeika, Street Wise. But when TVS lost its franchise to Meridian, he eventually ended up in the nascent but growing cable and satellite world, running the Maidstone-based Family Channel. </p> <p>When it was taken over by Flextech, he became vice-president of production for Bravo, UK Living and Challenge TV. His one regret is the way Flextech failed to develop the Children's Channel, retreating in the face of the Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon and then opting to turn it into the teenage Trouble channel. </p> <p>Married with three grown-up children, Pickard is praised by Alan Yentob, the BBC's bizarrely titled director of drama, entertainment and children, for having \"a profound understanding of the needs and aspirations of children in the UK today\". The truth is he's a mix of enthusiasm - \"he loves the crunchy stuff, mixing with producers,\" says a key supplier - with a strong commercial streak. </p> <p>His business sense is typified by CITV's switch to making long runs of drama and animation series - rather than old-fashioned sets of six - because it's the only way to attract international sales and co-production funds for expensive projects. Worst Witch is getting a third run and a Christmas special, so there will be 40 episodes in all. Pickard ordered 52 episodes of SMTV from the start.

      "body": "<p>An obnoxious German, complete with mullet haircut and shell suit, turns to a gang of beered-up Brits and leers: \"Come and have a go if you think you're hard enough.\" </p> <p>This incendiary scenario will be played out over and over again during the three weeks of Euro 2000, and not just on the terraces. It is Sega's new ad campaign for the Dreamcast console, and it will be broadcast in pubs and homes all over Europe, despite rising concerns about the possibility of violence at the tournament. </p> <p>Consumers are used to seeing cheap stunts from advertisers whose budgets don't match their ambitions, but Sega's venture doesn't come cheap - 30 seconds' television airtime costs \u00a380,000 during the bigger games - and the campaign, which began with the opening match between Belgium and Sweden on Saturday, will cost \u00a310m. At the heart of Sega's efforts is ChuChu Rocket, a game which allows up to four players to compete in a live, online game across Europe. For the first time, it claims, players will be able to take on European rivals from the comfort of their own bedrooms. </p> <p>So Sega and its advertising agency, Bartle Bogle Hegarty (BBH), have created three different ads announcing the launch of online console gaming between England, Germany, Spain, France and Ireland. The first has the shell-suited German putting us straight on a few facts, such as \"Germany always wins\". The statement is accompanied by images of towels neatly arranged on a row of sun loungers and crowds of Germans celebrating a footballing triumph. </p> <p>Next up is the English version. \"There's no need to tell you England is superior,\" announces an upper-class narrator, while pictures of Winston Churchill, Margaret Thatcher and a bulldog appear on screen. </p> <p>The voice continues: \"You beg us to join your precious Europe, but why? We come and see you every summer.\" This last line is delivered to images of drunken Brits abroad walking around with their trousers down or turning lobster pink in the hot sun. The challenge is issued: \"Play me head-to-head on your Dreamcast and let's see who's the daddy.\" </p> <p>The French version is set in the Caf\u00e9 de Ponce . A philosopher in a black polo neck explains that the French are not just intelligent, \"but also so cultured and stylish and artistic. And all your women want us.\" The narrator warms to his theme: \"You think you can defeat La France. You who are so stupid, like a peasant.\" </p> <p>In the right context, the ads are hilarious. But impassioned international football matches are not necessarily the right context. </p> <p>A Sega spokesman says: \"If they do cause offence, it's because of a lack of sense of humour, and we can't be held responsible for that.\" </p> <p>But only last week in Cornwall, English schoolchildren - encouraged by their parents - attacked a group of German youngsters, throwing stones and calling them Nazis. If this sort of incident is replayed among adult football fans in Charleroi, where England play Germany on Saturday, viewers may not be able to see the funny side of Sega's ads. </p> <p>Alison Turner, marketing director of Sega UK, claims not to have considered the possibility of the ads backfiring. Nor is she worried about viewers finding them offensive. </p> <p>\"People are entitled to their opinions, but we haven't created ads that are antagonistic,\" Turner says. \"They are a light-hearted look at European rivalry. They poke fun at national stereotypes.\" </p> <p>Insiders admit, however, that Sega has a fallback position should trouble erupt. Softer copies of the ads will be sent to broadcasters if violence flares up, but there is no guarantee that Sega will be able to react quickly enough. </p> <p>Paul Bradbury from BBH acknowledges the ads could cause offence: \"We would be naive to think that there would be no reaction to them. But they will make the brand famous and they hit the mark,\" he says. \"Probably people will be offended but I hope not - the jokes are cheap and obvious, they don't delve back into Nazi history.\" </p> <p>Bradbury says the ads were originally even tougher, before cuts were made to persuade the advertising watchdog to approve the campaign. Overt violence and provocative language had to be toned down, and the German ad was amended to make it less \"dark\" than the original script intended. </p> <p>Uisdean Maclean, director of the broadcast advertising clearance centre, believes the humour mitigates any possible offence. \"We could defend our approval because the ads are not hard-edged,\" says Maclean. \"They are funny.\" </p> <p>But British consumers aren't always good at seeing the funny side of things. When Ikea ran a series of ads in which Swedes urged viewers to \"Stop being so English\", the independent television commission received 175 complaints from people who thought the ads were racist. Carling was also accused of racism when it ran a series of ads mocking the French and the Germans. </p> <p>The most offensive aspect of the Sega campaign, it might be argued, is the reliance on tired jokes about Johnny Foreigner. Robert Saville, a partner at ad agency Mother, researched the lure of patriotism when planning the strategy for the launch of Whitbread's new lager, GB. </p> <p>\"Patriotism is old-fashioned,\" says Saville. \"It appeals to the older generation. And xenophobia is incredibly limiting. Taking the piss out of foreigners to make the British look good has been done. There are new ways of doing things.\" </p> <p>Sega might deny accusations of sensationalism, but clearly the brand needs to make maximum impact as quickly as possible. </p> <p>Sony launches online gaming for its rival platform, PlayStation 2, in 2001, so Sega has only a small window in which to make Dreamcast a household name. The console has been selling well, but has found it hard to match the buzz about the new PlayStation model. The campaign is a shameless attempt to tap in to the patriotic hype that surrounds Euro 2000. </p> <p>\"Offence is in the eye of the beholder,\" reasons Alfredo Marcantonio, the European creative director of ad agency D'Arcy. Sega will be hoping that the right people are watching their ads over the coming weeks.</p>",

      "bodyText": "The BBC World Service is often held up as a beacon of enlightened values and journalistic integrity around the globe, but it now stands accused of recklessness and institutional racism over its policy for recruiting foreign journalists. The broadcasting union Bectu and the National Union of Journalists have been joined by Imran Khan, the Lawrence family's campaigning solicitor, and political comedians Mark Thomas and Mark Steel, in condemning the corporation's carnivorous-sounding \"fresh blood\" policy. It is a policy which is intended to provide the BBC at Bush House with journalists of the highest calibre, but its critics say it will also create a climate of fear among staff and even expose some to physical danger. Bush House attracts foreign journalists to work in its language section, which broadcasts international news in 43 languages, including English. They come, for what many regard as the opportunity of a lifetime, from every part of the globe to take up contracts which, by the Home Office definition, must be unfulfillable by anyone already living in Britain. Until last July the norm was to get a two- or three-year deal initially, which in all probability would then be extended or renewed. But a recent change in policy, apparently under pressure from the Home Office, has meant that three-year fixed-term contracts are now given out with the proviso that at the end of that period recipients will have to compete openly with other applicants. Fair enough in the cutthroat London media world, some might say. Except that the name of the policy - \"fresh blood\" - implies that the decision will be weighted against those who have been away from their homeland for some years. Loss of contact with up-to-date culture and idioms is the justification for this. The initial three-year contract falls short of the four-year requirement for residency in Britain and, it is alleged, is designed to prevent the creation of a pool of foreign journalists at the World Service whose skills are too specialised to be useful anywhere else. As a result the broadcasters, many of whom arrive in Britain with their spouses and children, are forced to choose between seeking another niche job that they, uniquely, can fill in order to satisfy the Home Office; returning to a regime which may no longer welcome them; or applying for political asylum. A Bectu spokesman says: \"Many of the countries they come from have regimes which are not keen on journalists - the majority of the languages are African and central Asian.

Nigel had problems maintaining his erection, Sharon was worried her husband was having an affair, and Paul phoned in because he had the same problem as Nigel, although halfway through the call he revealed that he was gay. That changed things a little: Dr Pam wanted to check if he had problems coming out as well as simply coming. Then the researchers outside the studio window got terribly excited. They had Claire on the line, and she was radio gold dust. </p> <p>Claire had been a porn star, met a guy, got him some porn work, married him, had a kid and wanted him to give up the movies. The trouble was, his career was taking off and he didn't want to give it up. And after a hard day's work on a hot bed, the last thing he felt like was a repeat performance for his wife. </p> <p>\"Jerry Springer,\" I thought through my blushes, \"eat your heart out.\" </p> <p>Welcome to the strangest media launch of the year - where sitcom becomes fact. Dr Pam Spurr is London's very own Frasier Crane, an on-air psychiatrist with a phone-in show. Previously a psychologist at Guy's hospital, she even has an American accent. She started a two-hour emotional and sexual problems programme called Heart to Heart on soft-rock station Heart FM on Sunday nights from 10pm at the end of May, and she's getting calls that make Trisha look like a kids' TV programme. </p> <p>I first heard Dr Pam in her previous incarnation as sit-in doctor on Nigel Williams's late night love-songs programme. I was driving into London on Sunday night and Louise phoned in, complaining that her boyfriend didn't satisfy her. Dr Pam started with pretty direct suggestions as to what she should say until the girl explained that on Friday her female best friend had popped round, they'd messed about a bit and her mate had been better than her boyfriend. Now she wasn't sure if she preferred boys or girls. From then on, I was hooked. </p> <p>\"This new show's format is modelled a bit on the Frasier Crane show,\" admits Jana Rangoni, Heart's programme director. \"We originally had Dr Pam on Monday nights with Nigel Williams, but it worked so well we put her on Sundays and Tuesdays as well and then we found that the other elements of Nigel's show were getting between her and the listeners so we gave her a show of her own.\" </p> <p>The best call Dr Pam received in her Williams period was from a man - called David on air - who preferred porn to his wife. Halfway through the call his mobile rang. It was his wife. She'd been listening to him on the show and had recognised his voice. David went to pieces on air, repeating, 'This is a nightmare' again and again at increasing volume until finally he agreed to talk it all out with his wife. As they say in the US, don't touch that dial. </p> <p>\"Most people go on air with an assumed name but sometimes people recognise the caller's voice and phone the station or worse,\" Dr Pam explains. \"Once we had a woman on the line whose husband abused her and during the call it became clear he'd been listening to the radio - he burst into the room and was about to attack her. She just said, 'Oh my God' and hung up. We didn't really have time to do anything else so we sent for the police. We always ask callers for their name and phone number even if they plan to go on anonymously, and we've kept in touch with her and now she's doing OK.\" </p> <p>The show itself is highly staffed for a commercial radio station. Heart's studios normally contain just the DJ without even a producer. Dr Pam has three researchers, Rory the producer and someone to drive the desk, playing the records that pepper the show. </p> <p>\"I've been here for 20 years and I've seen the English change emotionally so much,\" Dr Pam says. \"Twenty years ago, you wouldn't get a male caller to a show like mine. Now you can do an entire show and realise that every caller was a man. It's different from TV because the TV problem shows are usually about people getting their 15 minutes. With us, it's usually that people just want a couple of minutes to talk and get some impartial advice.\" </p> <p>Of course, some trained psychiatrists might bemoan the brevity of the counselling. Others, such as Dr Deenesh Khoosal - a psychiatrist who performs a similar service on BBC Midlands local radio every Friday - think that airing these topics is good for the nation's soul. For the rest of us, yelling in delighted outrage at our car stereos when Dr Pam describes female masturbation techniques, the rights and wrongs don't enter into it. We've finally got our own Dr Ruth.

But an Israeli-Syrian peace accord can only come when there is a settlement of the fiendishly intractable issue of the Golan Heights. The countries have twice fought bitter wars for possession of the strategically vital territory. In the six-day war of 1967, Israeli forces stormed the Heights. They were driven back to the Galilee plain at the outset of the Yom Kippur war in 1973, but within weeks they had pushed the Syrians out again. Damascus insists that it must be given back all its lost lands, including Mount Hermon - where Israel has established a surveillance station overlooking Damascus - and part of the sea of Galilee as the price of peace. Israel insists that it must retain control of at least the Galilee shoreline and Mount Hermon, and that the rest of the Golan must be verifiably demilitarised to prevent Syrian artillery attacks on the coastal strip. There is a vocal movement in Israel for retention of the Golan Heights, where settlers have established thriving tourist, wine-making, and agricultural industries. But for the non-Jewish majority of Golan residents, both Arab and Druze, there is a growing sense that the future is Syrian.

The World Trade Organisation should be brought under the aegis of the UN, to ensure that the many concerns expressed about its activities by developing countries (and by many groups in the developed world) are fully reflected in its future policies. Bilateral relationships The government should end government-supported and funded trade missions and business ventures in China and other countries which serially abuse the human rights of their citizens.

      "bodyText": "A ferment in the world of the haiku - the 17-syllable verse seen as the simplest and most perfect form of poetry - will reach a head at a festival of 100 worldwide scholars in London and Oxford in August. More prosaically, the controversy will reach down to touch the classroom lives of tens of thousands of British schoolchildren.They are encouraged to write haikus as part of key stage three of the national curriculum. The form has broken free from its origins in classical Japan to be widely used in education, as well as by amateur and professional poets. At stake in the controversy - argued over in documents thousands of words long - is whether the brief poems should emulate the rural calm of Mensuo Basho, 17th century Japanese father of the genre: Waterjar cracks: I lie awake This icy night or reflect modern realities, like a new haiku composed in Slovenia: spring evening - the wheel of a troop carrier crushes a lizard or one written by a computer games-playing US teenager: Today I own you. Tomorrow I will be ruled The bloody wheel turns The experts will also debate whether contemporary haikus should stick to the 17 syllable rule or be restricted in their number of lines. The British Haiku Society has already begun rewriting guidelines in its 2,000-word pack for teachers. Its president, David Cobb, reportedly said yesterday that the aim was to breathe fresh life into the form without trivialising it. \"One walks a very sticky path between elitism and populism. I would be very unhappy if we were the cause of the dumbing-down of the haiku,\" he said. The present guidelines show how far English haikus have departed from their origins. A verse by Mr Cobb sticks closely to them: the frost holds: Friesians in the byre chew steam but another has only four syllables: puddles bubble. The ferment began last September with the 4,000-word Matsuyama Declaration in Japan urging poets to \"broaden the possibilities of a rich array\" of diversified national versions for the haiku. The declaration said even the traditional line arrangement - a single vertical line in Japanese calligraphy, three lines in the west - could be varied. One of the poets who engineered the declaration is Susumu Takiguchi, organiser of the British festival. Mr Takiguchi, chairman of the World Haiku Club, writes sometimes traditional haikus from the peace of a farmhouse near Bicester, Oxfordshire: spade splits the Earth into two worlds - earthworm in between Yesterday he was enthusiastic about the \"strong haiku movement\" in the whole of former Yugoslavia, which wrote about violence and ethnic cleansing. But he said the festival would challenge an American influenced \"minimalist\" trend towards single-line haikus which groped for \"a moment of enlightenment\" in the style of Zen Buddhism. Replying to purists who insist on strict adherence to ancient Japanese rules, he added, \"Diversity and difference do need to be encouraged.\"",

The (Glasgow) Herald is even running a poster campaign with Neil's picture and a quote from him - out of context, but so what? - urging people to \"Buy the Herald\". </p> <p>But Neil has reason to smile this week. The Scotsman has hit more than 94,000, a 19% rise on the previous month. In fact, for the final three weeks of the month it sold 105,000 - a 31% increase. As with most headline circulation figures, it isn't as good as it seems. Relaunched on May 8, the 45p Scotsman has since been selling for 20p, so it's impossible to say which new readers will stick with the paper. If price is the sole factor, many will do so for a long time yet because the cut is for an indefinite period. Some executives believe it may last until autumn, depending on how much profit the Barclay brothers are willing to sacrifice to build the Scotsman habit. </p> <p>Scotland on Sunday has also bounced back well after its technical hitch to record a sale of 107,000. That puts the pressure back on the rival Sunday Herald, thought to have full-rate sales of just 45,000. </p> <p>Outside the Scottish arena, the month of May wasn't too merry. A series of bank holidays didn't help, particularly among Sundays. The most notable figure is the News of the World's, at a surprisingly low 3.8m, which makes it understandable that News International decided to replace Phil Hall with Rebekah Wade. Last month the paper sold 6% fewer copies than in May last year. Its six-monthly average is more than 4% down on the same period in the previous year. Hall could point to the fact that his rivals have performed just as badly. But Rupert Murdoch likes to win, even in a falling market. </p> <p>It will be fascinating to see if Wade can turn around a relentlessly downward trend. She may take heart from the way the Sunday Mirror has slowed its decline through a clever marketing initiative without noticeably changing or improving editorial content. </p> <p>There is a similar difference in fortunes between the leading daily red-tops. The Mirror, at 32p, continues to slow the rate of decrease affecting the whole market while the 30p Sun falls further from its perch. How low will Murdoch let his beloved Sun reach before he contemplates replacing its editor, too? With sales below 3.5m, the paper is selling fewer copies than at any stage in recent history. The other alternative is to introduce yet another price cut, but that would rekindle the interest of the office of fair trading. Even so, it must be on Murdoch's mind and he may just take the risk. </p> <p>His price-cutting strategy has been more successful at the Times. But the ballyhoo of the revamp and the addition of a tabloid second section has made little impact. When Times 2 was launched in March, sales stood at 720,000. Last month they were 3,000 more, hardly a vote of confidence. </p> <p>The Times's six-monthly average is down by 3%, compared to the Guardian's loss of less than 1% and the Independent's slight rise, due to bulk sales. The Daily Telegraph's high-wire act to keep itself above the magic 1m continues to amaze, but its 46,000 freebies to a variety of hotels and airlines help maintain the illusion of success. </p> <p>Perhaps the most interesting arena is the middle market, with the Mail titles having reached, for the first time since the early 1990s, a plateau.

He came back to the UK in 1985 and until 1995 worked at the Friarage Hospital in Northallerton, North Yorkshire. </p> <p>Mr Neale left the hospital because of \"concerns about the extent of his commitment\" but received \u00a3100,000 severance pay and a good reference before going on to work in Leicester, London and the Isle of Wight. </p> <p>He was suspended by the GMC \"to protect public safety\" while working in a private clinic in Leeds last year. The GMC has been criticised for allowing the consultant to work in the UK, despite knowing that he had been struck off in Canada. </p> <p>When a date was set for the hearing, Mr Neale issued a statement saying: \"I continue to regret those instances in which any of my patients suffered post-operative complications but I have always maintained this: that I am both a competent and caring surgeon. </p> <p>\"The allegations that have been made against me have been extremely distressing and the many months in which I have not worked as a doctor have been traumatic for me and my family. </p> <p> \"I hope the GMC hearing will bring this matter to a conclusion.\" </p> <p>The case is expected to last three weeks. </p> <p>\u0095 His case comes a week after a damning report was published on gynaecologist Rodney Ledward, who was struck off by the GMC last year after being found guilty of botching surgery on 10 women. Hundreds more former patients of Ledward have since come forward saying they were left maimed and scarred by the Kent surgeon.</p> <p>A proposed shake-up of the GMC is expected to lead to a speeding up in disciplinary cases and harsher punishment for doctors found guilty of serious professional misconduct. </p>",

Mr Neale, who has worked in London, the Isle of Wight, and Leicester, was suspended by the GMC last year while working in a private clinic in Leeds. Appearing before the GMC's professional conduct committee this morning, Mr Neale admitted three of the 37 charges. He admitted failing to perform a pre-operative x-ray or a post-operative mammogram on a patient known as Mrs A at the Friarage Hospital in Northallerton, North Yorkshire, in 1986. He also admitted failing to provide the GP of a patient known as Mrs D with a letter about complications after an operation in 1991 and failing to inform another patient's doctor of possible damage to her bladder after a 1996 operation. Mr Neale, 52, is also being sued by 60 women for allegedly performing unnecessary surgery that left them in agony and some with organ damage and unable to have children. North Yorkshire Police are investigating claims that Mr Neale, from Leeds, falsified his qualifications to work in this country. The British-born consultant began his career in Canada in the 1970s after training in England. But he was barred from practice in two provinces in the mid-1980s after a series of mistakes which left two patients dead. He came back to the UK in 1985 and until 1995 worked at the Friarage Hospital in Northallerton, North Yorkshire. Mr Neale left the hospital because of \"concerns about the extent of his commitment\" but received \u00a3100,000 severance pay and a good reference before going on to work in Leicester, London and the Isle of Wight. He was suspended by the GMC \"to protect public safety\" while working in a private clinic in Leeds last year. The GMC has been criticised for allowing the consultant to work in the UK, despite knowing that he had been struck off in Canada. When a date was set for the hearing, Mr Neale issued a statement saying: \"I continue to regret those instances in which any of my patients suffered post-operative complications but I have always maintained this: that I am both a competent and caring surgeon. \"The allegations that have been made against me have been extremely distressing and the many months in which I have not worked as a doctor have been traumatic for me and my family. \"I hope the GMC hearing will bring this matter to a conclusion.\" The case is expected to last three weeks. \u0095 His case comes a week after a damning report was published on gynaecologist Rodney Ledward, who was struck off by the GMC last year after being found guilty of botching surgery on 10 women. Hundreds more former patients of Ledward have since come forward saying they were left maimed and scarred by the Kent surgeon. A proposed shake-up of the GMC is expected to lead to a speeding up in disciplinary cases and harsher punishment for doctors found guilty of serious professional misconduct.",

Mermaids was her first feature, at the ripe old age of nine, but it was as mini-goth Wednesday in The Addams Family that she really came to prominence. The dark, brooding and downright moody role seemed to possess Ricci in real life, too - she admits to having eating disorders and cutting herself in her teens. Now 20, and after superb coming-of-age appearances in Buffalo 66 and Pecker, she's still walking on the dark side - she recently appeared in Tim Burton's gothic horror Sleepy Hollow and her next project is an adaptation of Elizabeth Wurtzel's Prozac Nation.

      "bodyText": "Christina Ricci in Mermaids (Richard Benjamin, 1990) Who? One of that rare breed - a child star who's made it as an adult actress - Ricci attended the Professional Children's School in New York alongside Macaulay Culkin - who didn't make the transition quite so smoothly. Mermaids was her first feature, at the ripe old age of nine, but it was as mini-goth Wednesday in The Addams Family that she really came to prominence. The dark, brooding and downright moody role seemed to possess Ricci in real life, too - she admits to having eating disorders and cutting herself in her teens. Now 20, and after superb coming-of-age appearances in Buffalo 66 and Pecker, she's still walking on the dark side - she recently appeared in Tim Burton's gothic horror Sleepy Hollow and her next project is an adaptation of Elizabeth Wurtzel's Prozac Nation. Cheery stuff. The role: Kate Flax, a swimming-obsessed nine-year-old who lives with her slatternly mother (Cher) and her pious, aspirant nun sister (Winona Ryder). Best line: Not a line so much as a strange screaming/ gurgling sound as she walks around the house with a pumpkin on her head trying to scare her mother. Cringe factor: See above. Other wannabes: The startlingly named Dossy Peabody, who plays Coach Parker, also turns up in a later Winona Ryder vehicle, The Crucible, as Goody Sibber. Critical judgement: Desson Howe in the Washington Post said the film \"doesn't come of age so much as die of it. It's awash in mediocrity, waterlogged with innocuousness\".

      "body": "<p>Following Dirty Den's spectacular departure from EastEnders, Leslie Grantham appeared in a commercial. Lying in a sud-filled bath, Grantham asked if there was life after soap. He wore a nervous smile, a smell of desperation to his nonchalance. That's because, even as recently as the mid-80s, leaving a soap opera was a risky business. For every Nick Berry, there'd be an Anita Dobson or a Leslie Grantham. </p> <p>Now, the post-soap path to glory seems more assured. On Thursday, Patsy Palmer makes her post-EastEnders debut in McCready &amp; Daughter, a one-off detective drama written by Robert Jones, co-creator of award-winning BBC2 series, The Cops. </p> <p>Palmer plays the wayward daughter of a down-at-heel private eye (Lorcan Cranitch from Ballykissangel), gumshoeing his way round the crisp packets of Kilburn. She makes an explosive entrance, setting fire to her landlady's flat. In a bizarre continuation of the EastEnders storyline on which she left, Palmer escapes her old life by going to college (though her new character, Clare, has none of the enthusiasm for the project, the animus that fired Bianca on to a better life). </p> <p>Palmer is a fantastically good actress, as her sustained wail of pain in EastEnders testified. And there can be little doubt that the BBC will use her fame to promote what could otherwise be just another bog-standard detective drama. A trick previously pulled off with another ex-Ender, Michelle Collins, in Real Women. </p> <p>Palmer's co-star, Cranitch, has his own soap demons to live down, graduating from Ballykissangel (or Cosykissangel as unkind critics dubbed it). BallyK took a darker turn with the arrival of Cranitch, who played a married man with a permanently furrowed brow, weighed down by a doomed affair. Cranitch is burnt into my memory from an earlier role, brilliantly playing a weak, corruptible and just-this-side-of-psychotic detective in Cracker. </p> <p>Coincidentally, Robert Jones originally devised the part of McCready for another actor: Tony Doyle, who played alongside Cranitch in BallyK, and who died suddenly at the beginning of production. The baton was passed to Cranitch - not an obvious choice for lead, but all the more interesting for that. </p> <p>Together, Cranitch and Palmer make a formidable double-act. There's a bruised quality to both performances which, sadly, the script doesn't take full advantage of. Not least because it leans uncomfortably towards comedy when it could have gone darker. </p> <p>Nowadays it seems inconceivable that there are any permutations of the detective double-act left to try out: Man/Man; Woman/Woman; Man/Woman; Man/Dog; Woman/ Cat; Man/Car; Dead Man/Live Man; Mystic/Hippie, and spoofs of all of the above. </p> <p>McCready &amp; Daughter concentrates on the domestic complexities of the modern family: resoldering broken relationships; making peace with the ex; scratching a living from a business that happens to be a room above a shop in Kilburn, not a dot.com co in London's overly trendy Clerkenwell district. </p> <p>It's a paradox that writers of middle-brow dramas, detective or otherwise, have taken over the role once played by soap operas. Namely, that of reflecting a kind of truth about minor as well as tectonic shifts in British society. </p> <p>Soaps, meanwhile, have become antechambers to a bigger, more serious acting career. Once, they were a job for life. Now they're just a staging post, the next thing you do after leaving the Anna Scher School. This social fluidity probably makes modern soaps a reflection of the breakdown in traditional class barriers - but then again, maybe not. </p> <p>For popular drama, the tackling of uncomfortable subject matter is really no more than a return to the early 1960s, when police procedurals like Z Cars tackled taboo areas like child abuse, divorce and domestic violence. Modern drama isn't afraid to confront such subjects - on the contrary, it often relishes in confronting them. But the great temptation now is to avoid tackling the low-key and humdrum, the inherent drama of simply surviving, which is the great strength of a series like McCready &amp; Daughter. </p> <p>In a couple of weeks' time, Ross Kemp makes his ITV debut in a legal drama. The departure of Grant Mitchell from EastEnders was kept ambiguous in order to leave Kemp with a window, should he wish to return. The only hitch is that he doesn't look he'll need it. </p> <p>While so-called boomerang characters like Sam (played by Danniella Westbrook) return each year like a bad smell, an actor of the stature and popularity of Kemp can take his pick of roles. Who knows, in 20 years' time, a writer may even devise a comedic reunion of Grant and Sharon \u00e0 la Bobby and Sheila in The Royle Family. But I doubt it. He'll probably be in Hollywood, remaking The Rock with Guy Ritchie. </p> <p>\u0095 McCready &amp; Daughter, BBC1, Thursday June 15, 8.10pm</p>",

On Thursday, Patsy Palmer makes her post-EastEnders debut in McCready &amp; Daughter, a one-off detective drama written by Robert Jones, co-creator of award-winning BBC2 series, The Cops. Palmer plays the wayward daughter of a down-at-heel private eye (Lorcan Cranitch from Ballykissangel), gumshoeing his way round the crisp packets of Kilburn. She makes an explosive entrance, setting fire to her landlady's flat. In a bizarre continuation of the EastEnders storyline on which she left, Palmer escapes her old life by going to college (though her new character, Clare, has none of the enthusiasm for the project, the animus that fired Bianca on to a better life). Palmer is a fantastically good actress, as her sustained wail of pain in EastEnders testified. And there can be little doubt that the BBC will use her fame to promote what could otherwise be just another bog-standard detective drama. A trick previously pulled off with another ex-Ender, Michelle Collins, in Real Women. Palmer's co-star, Cranitch, has his own soap demons to live down, graduating from Ballykissangel (or Cosykissangel as unkind critics dubbed it). BallyK took a darker turn with the arrival of Cranitch, who played a married man with a permanently furrowed brow, weighed down by a doomed affair. Cranitch is burnt into my memory from an earlier role, brilliantly playing a weak, corruptible and just-this-side-of-psychotic detective in Cracker. Coincidentally, Robert Jones originally devised the part of McCready for another actor: Tony Doyle, who played alongside Cranitch in BallyK, and who died suddenly at the beginning of production. The baton was passed to Cranitch - not an obvious choice for lead, but all the more interesting for that. Together, Cranitch and Palmer make a formidable double-act. There's a bruised quality to both performances which, sadly, the script doesn't take full advantage of. Not least because it leans uncomfortably towards comedy when it could have gone darker. Nowadays it seems inconceivable that there are any permutations of the detective double-act left to try out: Man/Man; Woman/Woman; Man/Woman; Man/Dog; Woman/ Cat; Man/Car; Dead Man/Live Man; Mystic/Hippie, and spoofs of all of the above. McCready &amp; Daughter concentrates on the domestic complexities of the modern family: resoldering broken relationships; making peace with the ex; scratching a living from a business that happens to be a room above a shop in Kilburn, not a dot.com co in London's overly trendy Clerkenwell district. It's a paradox that writers of middle-brow dramas, detective or otherwise, have taken over the role once played by soap operas. Namely, that of reflecting a kind of truth about minor as well as tectonic shifts in British society. Soaps, meanwhile, have become antechambers to a bigger, more serious acting career. Once, they were a job for life. Now they're just a staging post, the next thing you do after leaving the Anna Scher School. This social fluidity probably makes modern soaps a reflection of the breakdown in traditional class barriers - but then again, maybe not. For popular drama, the tackling of uncomfortable subject matter is really no more than a return to the early 1960s, when police procedurals like Z Cars tackled taboo areas like child abuse, divorce and domestic violence. Modern drama isn't afraid to confront such subjects - on the contrary, it often relishes in confronting them. But the great temptation now is to avoid tackling the low-key and humdrum, the inherent drama of simply surviving, which is the great strength of a series like McCready &amp; Daughter. In a couple of weeks' time, Ross Kemp makes his ITV debut in a legal drama. The departure of Grant Mitchell from EastEnders was kept ambiguous in order to leave Kemp with a window, should he wish to return. The only hitch is that he doesn't look he'll need it. While so-called boomerang characters like Sam (played by Danniella Westbrook) return each year like a bad smell, an actor of the stature and popularity of Kemp can take his pick of roles. Who knows, in 20 years' time, a writer may even devise a comedic reunion of Grant and Sharon \u00e0 la Bobby and Sheila in The Royle Family. But I doubt it. He'll probably be in Hollywood, remaking The Rock with Guy Ritchie. \u0095 McCready &amp; Daughter, BBC1, Thursday June 15, 8.10pm",

      "body": "<h2>Shop till you drop</h2> <p>Pioneering research from Sussex has at last confirmed what most of us already suspected but have never been able to prove scientifically - that shopping is bad for your health.</p> <p>The research, conducted by psychologist Dr David Lewis, of East Dean, reveals how the increasing discourtesy and aggression of shop staff and fellow shoppers has turned modern consumerism into a nightmare of stress and physical danger.</p> <p>\"Our whole lifestyle has become stressful,\" explained Dr Lewis, \"with the result that people no longer have time to shop or to serve shoppers properly. It's shocking how many people now consider rudeness to be part of the whole consumer experience.\"</p> <p>In the course of his research Dr Lewis provided subjects with miniature video cameras and asked them to film what went on when they visited the shops. They were also hooked up to sensors which measured their heart rates.</p> <p>One man's heart rate rose to more than 250 beats per minute as he battled the crowds on Oxford Street, central London, in search of knickers for his girlfriend. In another instance, an assistant at a Bradford electrical store joked with a man about how stupid his wife was as she stood beside him clutching their broken toaster.</p> <p>Dr Lewis's report, titled The Soul of the New Consumer: Authenticity, What We Buy and Why in the New Economy, is available at all good bookshops. \"I have to have a copy,\" said one student. \"And woe betide any bastard that tries to stop me.\"<br><strong>Eastbourne Evening Argus</strong></p> <h2>Dairy of a nobody</h2> <p>Another exciting addition to Britain's bookshelves comes this week in the form of a biography of Yorkshireman Fred Taylor, the resident cheese expert at West Marton dairy.</p> <p>Most people will probably never have heard of West Marton dairy, or, indeed, Mr Taylor. But biographer Bill Mitchell insists this should not in any way interfere with their enjoyment of his book, which provides a fascinating insight into the world of cheese-making in an obscure Yorkshire village.</p> <p>The volume begins with an account of Mr Taylor's early life on a small hill-farm in the Yorkshire Dales in the 1930s, and charts his growing infatuation with all-things cheese.</p> <p>Like any good life-story it contains moments of reversal and tragedy before Mr Taylor eventually rises to the giddy heights of chief cheese grader, en route collecting more than 150 items of traditional cheese-making equipment.</p> <p>Particular highlights include a lengthy description of Mr Taylor mending a gap in a dry stone wall, and a dramatic confrontation between a young Mr Taylor and his father on the subject of pocket money.</p> <p>\"It's a real page-turner,\" enthused one satisfied reader. \"A cross between Cider with Rosie and Shogun ... with extra cheese.\"</p> <p>Fred Taylor, Yorkshire Cheesemaker is published by Castleburg Books at \u00a34.99.<br><strong>Craven Herald</strong></p> <h2>Rising damp</h2> <p>One of the least successful, not to mention one of the wettest robberies of the new millennium took place in Barnsley this week when a crack team of thieves endeavoured to purloin all the copper piping from an empty house.</p> <p>The thieves, described as \"a highly professional outfit with previous plumbing experience,\" had, it seems, been staking out the house for several days to ensure that it was genuinely empty.</p> <p>Once they had convinced themselves that it was, they skilfully gained entry via the roof and began removing the piping, using the latest plumbing equipment to aid them in their dastardly enterprise. </p> <p>It all went like clockwork until they started cutting the piping, whereupon their otherwise foolproof scheme was found wanting - they had forgotten to turn the water off.</p> <p>\"It was the middle of the night,\" recalled one neighbour, \"And we heard someone scream. Then we saw these men come running out of the house, all soaking wet. You could hear them squelching all the way down the street.\"</p> <p>Any members of the public who saw three men in wet shell suits running through the middle of Barnsley clutching a bag full of monkey-wrenches have been urged to contact the police. <br><strong>Barnsley Chronicle</strong></p> <h2>A bit of the udder</h2> <p>A new crisis looks set to rock our beleaguered farming industry - a dramatic decline in bovine sex drive.</p> <p>The problem centres on East Halton, near Scunthorpe, where local beef-farmers have noticed a marked reluctance on the part of breeding bulls to get down to business with their cows.</p> <p>\"They just don't seem to have the energy,\" said one exasperated farmer. \"They just wander off to the other side of the field and stand eating grass. You can almost hear them saying 'Sorry, dear, I've got a headache.' I've got one bull, Errol, who used to go like the clappers. Now he just can't be bothered.\" </p> <p>Various theories have been put forward to explain this sudden sexual reticence on the part of Scunthorpe's bullocks.

      "bodyText": "Shop till you drop Pioneering research from Sussex has at last confirmed what most of us already suspected but have never been able to prove scientifically - that shopping is bad for your health. The research, conducted by psychologist Dr David Lewis, of East Dean, reveals how the increasing discourtesy and aggression of shop staff and fellow shoppers has turned modern consumerism into a nightmare of stress and physical danger. \"Our whole lifestyle has become stressful,\" explained Dr Lewis, \"with the result that people no longer have time to shop or to serve shoppers properly. It's shocking how many people now consider rudeness to be part of the whole consumer experience.\" In the course of his research Dr Lewis provided subjects with miniature video cameras and asked them to film what went on when they visited the shops. They were also hooked up to sensors which measured their heart rates. One man's heart rate rose to more than 250 beats per minute as he battled the crowds on Oxford Street, central London, in search of knickers for his girlfriend. In another instance, an assistant at a Bradford electrical store joked with a man about how stupid his wife was as she stood beside him clutching their broken toaster. Dr Lewis's report, titled The Soul of the New Consumer: Authenticity, What We Buy and Why in the New Economy, is available at all good bookshops. \"I have to have a copy,\" said one student. \"And woe betide any bastard that tries to stop me.\" Eastbourne Evening Argus Dairy of a nobody Another exciting addition to Britain's bookshelves comes this week in the form of a biography of Yorkshireman Fred Taylor, the resident cheese expert at West Marton dairy. Most people will probably never have heard of West Marton dairy, or, indeed, Mr Taylor. But biographer Bill Mitchell insists this should not in any way interfere with their enjoyment of his book, which provides a fascinating insight into the world of cheese-making in an obscure Yorkshire village. The volume begins with an account of Mr Taylor's early life on a small hill-farm in the Yorkshire Dales in the 1930s, and charts his growing infatuation with all-things cheese. Like any good life-story it contains moments of reversal and tragedy before Mr Taylor eventually rises to the giddy heights of chief cheese grader, en route collecting more than 150 items of traditional cheese-making equipment. Particular highlights include a lengthy description of Mr Taylor mending a gap in a dry stone wall, and a dramatic confrontation between a young Mr Taylor and his father on the subject of pocket money. \"It's a real page-turner,\" enthused one satisfied reader. \"A cross between Cider with Rosie and Shogun ... with extra cheese.\" Fred Taylor, Yorkshire Cheesemaker is published by Castleburg Books at \u00a34.99. Craven Herald Rising damp One of the least successful, not to mention one of the wettest robberies of the new millennium took place in Barnsley this week when a crack team of thieves endeavoured to purloin all the copper piping from an empty house. The thieves, described as \"a highly professional outfit with previous plumbing experience,\" had, it seems, been staking out the house for several days to ensure that it was genuinely empty. Once they had convinced themselves that it was, they skilfully gained entry via the roof and began removing the piping, using the latest plumbing equipment to aid them in their dastardly enterprise. It all went like clockwork until they started cutting the piping, whereupon their otherwise foolproof scheme was found wanting - they had forgotten to turn the water off. \"It was the middle of the night,\" recalled one neighbour, \"And we heard someone scream. Then we saw these men come running out of the house, all soaking wet. You could hear them squelching all the way down the street.\" Any members of the public who saw three men in wet shell suits running through the middle of Barnsley clutching a bag full of monkey-wrenches have been urged to contact the police. Barnsley Chronicle A bit of the udder A new crisis looks set to rock our beleaguered farming industry - a dramatic decline in bovine sex drive. The problem centres on East Halton, near Scunthorpe, where local beef-farmers have noticed a marked reluctance on the part of breeding bulls to get down to business with their cows. \"They just don't seem to have the energy,\" said one exasperated farmer. \"They just wander off to the other side of the field and stand eating grass. You can almost hear them saying 'Sorry, dear, I've got a headache.' I've got one bull, Errol, who used to go like the clappers. Now he just can't be bothered.\" Various theories have been put forward to explain this sudden sexual reticence on the part of Scunthorpe's bullocks. The most likely is a marked reduction in their blood copper levels as a result of sulphur pollution from local factories. But one farmer's wife has a different explanation. \"They take their lead from their owners,\" she explained. \"And with a husband like mine, you're lucky if they're going to perform more than once a year, and then only for a few minutes.\" Scunthorpe Evening Telegraph Letter of the week Dear Sir, I woke up to find a large tame rabbit on my front lawn at my house in Hawtonville. It had eaten two rows of petunias and also wreaked havoc in a neighbour's garden. I phoned up the RSPCA. \"We can't do anything unless you catch it,\" I was told. \"Then we can come and take it away.\" I asked how I was to catch it. \"I don't know, but that's how we operate,\" said the woman, apparently assuming that everyone knew how to catch and handle animals. I subsequently phoned Newark and Sherwood district council for help, and in a very short time the council dog-catcher arrived with his mate, caught the rabbit and took it away. My grateful thanks go to them for their prompt action. Apparently they care more for the plight of people and animals than a supposedly caring institution which is bequeathed such vast sums of money from a caring public that it can afford to let other people do its job.

I'd gone to a new county and was keen to mark my arrival with a good performance. I felt I was bowling well and had done well in the B&amp;H, but the County Championship hadn't been so fruitful. So it was a big relief to get wickets and to contribute to the win.</p> <p>\"It has been fantastic here at Derbyshire.

Doing well against the county champions has given us the belief that we can go ahead and repeat the win in following weeks.</p> <p> \"I suppose playing against Surrey does make you up your game, in that you have to because you are playing against a very good side. When I was at Warwickshire I had the other side of it - we always had the feeling that everyone was trying especially hard against us. But, and in fact we were talking about this the other day, two divisions has made every game a big game. And that can only be good news.</p> <p> \"The pitch at Derby has come in for some comment. There was a lot of rain around, and a little bit of moisture. It helped the seam bowlers throughout the game but I wouldn't say it was a very poor pitch.</p> <p> \"I bowled from the pavilion end and it was one of those magic days when everything clicks. From over one, no maybe over two, I felt very pleased with my rhythm. I like bowling against left-handers [Mark Butcher and Ian Ward, Surrey's openers, are both left-handed] and to bowl to two of them is a real plus for me, though I know some bowlers have a mental block about it.</p> <p> My first wicket was Butcher - it was a ball that pitched quite full and then swung back in, Mark got a little inside edge onto the stumps.</p> <p> \"Then it was Graham Thorpe. The first ball that I bowled to him went away, and the next one swung back in, he didn't play a shot and I had him lbw. It was nice to see him depart: I've had my days against him but I've also been on the receiving end of a couple of Thorpe hundreds.</p> <p> \"[Alec] Stewart was next, out to a ball that came back into him, went through the gate and got him off stump.</p> <p> \"Adam Hollioake fell just after lunch to a very good catch by Matthew Dowman. It was quite funny actually, I'd had a short leg [Dowman] in for a while, then he went to midwicket. But when we came back on, Matt asked me where I wanted him and I said, 'Oh go to short leg.' Hollioake hit, I think the first ball after lunch, off the full face of the bat straight into his hands. It was a very good catch.</p> <p> \"Then it was Jason Ratcliffe, my old Warwickshire team-mate. It was hard not to smile when he came to the crease. But to his credit he fell to my best ball. I bowled it from wide of the crease and the ball swung out, carried on off the seam, and hit off stump. I was very keen to do well against him, and we had a bit of friendly banter in the bar afterwards.</p> <p> \"Martin Bicknell got an inside edge and was caught behind by Karl Krikken. It was a very good catch. I have to give Karl credit. I knew when I joined Derbyshire that he was renowned for being under-rated and for being very, very consistent, and this year he has certainly added a different dimension to my bowling because he has been prepared to stand up to the stumps. I'm sure Keith Piper, who I consider the best keeper in the country, would have stood up to me at Warwickshire but it was a bit of a macho thing and I didn't want him to. But now I'm a bit older and longer in the tooth, I was prepared to take up Karl's offer.</p> <p> \"[Alex] Tudor was the final one - to an inswinging yorker.

The attack by Sir Ken Jackson, the general secretary of the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union (AEEU), was initially interpreted as a rebuke to Tony Blair for failing to give a lead on the single currency. But Sir Ken, Downing Street's favourite trade union leader who was knighted by the prime minister, rarely moves against his admirer. He is, after all, the man who fixed the AEEU's vote to block Ken Livingstone standing as Labour's London mayor candidate. His aides made clear that Sir Ken's remarks were in fact aimed at Gordon Brown who is lukewarm about the euro. The chancellor is resisting pressure from pro-European cabinet ministers to sound more enthusiastic about the single currency, to the frustration of trade union and business leaders who want the government to set a timetable for membership. Sir Ken's speech today has fuelled speculation that Downing Street is quietly orchestrating a campaign to allow pro-Europeans to start beating the drum for the currency, amid fears that the Tories have hijacked the issue with their Keep the Pound campaign. The cross-party Britain in Europe group, which was set up to campaign in favour of the European Union with the blessing of Downing Street, has been \"given the green light\" to widen its campaign to include the euro. As Sir Ken was speaking in Blackpool, the group launched a new pamphlet, called the Case for the Euro, which warns of the economic dangers of failing to join the currency. There are, however, limits to Downing Street's enthusiasm for the euro. Stephen Byers, the pro-European trade and industry secretary, was believed to have been encouraged by Downing Street to make his keynote speech last Friday in which he said that businesses would gain from British membership.

In the previous Mori poll, carried out last month after the birth of the prime minister's son, Labour was on 48 points, with the Tories on 32.</p> <p>The poor showing was compounded by a leaked memo by Philip Gould, the prime minister's polling guru, in which he wrote that middle Britain believed that Mr Blair was out of touch and was failing to deliver on his key election promises. Mr Gould said the prime minister was believed by middle Britain to be \"all spin and presentation\".</p> <p>The damning assessment of the prime minister was made by \"switch voters\" interviewed by Mr Gould in focus groups. They said, according to the memo leaked to the Sunday Times, that: \"TB has not delivered.

      "bodyText": "Downing Street and Millbank spent the weekend drawing up plans for another government relaunch after Labour strategists admitted privately that senior ministers were caught off guard by the sudden drop in support for the party. Amid growing signs that the general election could be less than a year away, the prime minister and the chancellor will lead the cabinet's fiercest attack on the Tories since the general election in an attempt to halt the drop in support for Labour. The fightback, which will be dismissed by Labour's opponents as a sign of desperation, was signalled after an opinion poll in the Mail on Sunday showed that Tony Blair's lead over the Tories has sunk to an all-time low of three points. The Mori poll, which was carried out two days after the prime minister's disastrous speech to the Women's Institute on Wednesday, showed Labour on 41 points, with the Tories on 38. In the previous Mori poll, carried out last month after the birth of the prime minister's son, Labour was on 48 points, with the Tories on 32. The poor showing was compounded by a leaked memo by Philip Gould, the prime minister's polling guru, in which he wrote that middle Britain believed that Mr Blair was out of touch and was failing to deliver on his key election promises. Mr Gould said the prime minister was believed by middle Britain to be \"all spin and presentation\". The damning assessment of the prime minister was made by \"switch voters\" interviewed by Mr Gould in focus groups. They said, according to the memo leaked to the Sunday Times, that: \"TB has not delivered. He said he would improve the NHS and public services, he said he would improve Britain, but instead things have got worse.\" Mr Gould was also devastating about an early draft of Mr Blair's speech to the WI. In a note to Alastair Campbell, the prime minister's official spokesman, Mr Gould said: \"This speech does not work because it does not feel authentic. It reads like TB reacting to criticism, rather than saying what he believes in.\" Alarmed by the Gould note, the prime minister personally changed his speech. Despite his efforts, the speech still crashed, with embarrassing consequences. Labour sources last night dismissed the significance of the Gould memo on \"switch voters\", saying that his missives often made uncomfortable reading and were a sign of the prime minister's determination to remain in touch with voters who are not natural Labour supporters. However, there was more alarm at the drop in support. A senior Labour source said the party's own research showed that Labour has lost support over its handling of the NHS, though this is now returning, and on asylum. Support for the government on education and its handling of the economy is remaining firm. However, strategists are in no doubt that Labour has a fight on its hands after the Tories' success in dominating the headlines in recent months. \"Because things have been going so smoothly we have been caught slightly unawares by the fact it is possible to create an electoral atmosphere,\" one said. The unease was voiced publicly by the environment minister, Michael Meacher. Speaking on GMTV, he said: \"I think the government has done plenty of good things...[but] we are under pressure now and we have to [speak] in an unvarnished, straight, clear and honest manner.\" Strategists say the fightback will highlight Labour's achievements in four key areas. They are: \u0095 Reforms of the NHS, which contrast with the threat of private medical insurance promised by the Tories; \u0095 One Nation policies, such as the New Deal and the working families tax credit, which compare with the \"social division\" offered by the Tories; \u0095 Success on the world stage and in Europe as opposed to \"an isolated Britain under the Tories\"; \u0095 Economic stability against the uncertainty of a return to Tory boom and bust. Senior ministers will also say that New Labour is still determined to appeal to the wide audience which flocked to the party in 1997, rather than simply appealing to core voters. \"The big tent is what got us elected and it will move forward,\" one source said. The Tories claimed that the polls showed that they were at last staging a recovery. The Tory chairman, Michael Ancram, said: \"The New Labour bubble has burst.

      "body": "<p>Private. Intensely private. That, for a very long time, was as much as we were told about Camilla Parker-Bowles. True, the woman had more reason than most to be private, but love of privacy, her friends insisted, would have been a Parker-Bowles quality even if she hadn't got involved in a 25-year affair with her future sovereign and endured having their intensely private smutty telephone call transcribed as entertainment for the masses.</p> <p>Since she was so private, not being officially acknowledged or generally liked seemed to suit Camilla just fine. \"She is without personal ambition,\" revealed Ingrid Seward, one of her supporters, \"and insists she will always be happier pruning the roses than planting them.\" \"Camilla becomes nervous when the spotlight turns on her,\" said fellow sympathiser Stuart Higgins, a former editor of the Sun.</p> <p>All she wanted, her friends said, was to be with Charles. \"She's a very private person - I can't see her cutting ribbons,\" Patti Palmer-Tomkinson, a friend of the couple, told the New Yorker in 1997. \"I've never heard them mention marriage. While they've got each other in private it's their romance; it belongs to them.\"</p> <p>That summer, when everyone still expected the Diana v Camilla story to run for ever, a love of privacy was starting to look like rather an attractive quality. While the princess pranced around the Mediterranean in high-cut swimsuits, public opinion began to soften towards Camilla. It may even have helped when Diana's new boon companion, Mohamed al Fayed, whose son would become her lover, gave a press conference in which he boasted about their intimacy and declared that \"Camilla's like something from a Dracula film compared with Diana, who is so full of life\". In July 1997, just before her 50th birthday, 68% of those polled for the Daily Mirror said Charles should be free to marry Camilla. William Hill cut the odds of the couple marrying before the turn of the century from 6-1 to 3-1. Two months later, Diana was dead.</p> <p>As Diana worshippers clamoured for vengeance, Camilla returned to her privacy. In fact, as reported by the kindly Higgins, she \"temporarily vanished from view while she supported Prince Charles, giving him hope for the future\". Business as usual, really. When she came to vulgar notice in 1992, with the publication of extracts from Andrew Morton's Diana: Her True Story, Camilla had been avoiding public notice and giving Prince Charles hope for the future for a good decade or two already.</p> <p>The press only caught on when Morton transcribed Diana's charge that Camilla had haunted her marriage since her honeymoon, with the implication that the affair with Charles had resumed, and was now callously conducted in full view of staff, neighbours and friends. The day the extracts appeared, Camilla's home fell under siege. \"It's fiction, it's fiction,\" said a helpless Andrew Parker-Bowles.</p> <p>According to the rushed biographies that followed, Camilla Shand, the scantily educated daughter of a master of foxhounds, and great grand-daughter of Alice Keppel, mistress of Edward VII, had instantly appealed to Prince Charles when they met in 1972. Although not, as they say, photogenic, Camilla is reputed to have had many other charms, \"animal magnetism\" foremost among them. And crucially, as Jonathan Dimbleby recorded in his hagiography, \"she was convulsed by the Goons\".</p> <p>Royal-watching mythology has it that, on their first encounter, Camilla propositioned Charles thus: \"My great-grandmother and your great-great-grandfather were lovers. So how about it?\" The animal magnetism did its bit. \"It finally made him a man,\" one of Camilla's \"friends\" told Christopher Wilson, the author of A Greater Love, Charles and Camilla.</p> <p>Which makes it all the more ungrateful that the newly virile Prince Charles promptly embarked on an eight-month cruise aboard HMS Minerva. By the time he returned, Camilla had married a cavalry officer called Andrew Parker-Bowles, a match that appeared, at the time, to have been made in animal magnetism heaven.</p> <p>So the royal dalliance was put on hold. But after the Parker-Bowleses had had their two children, Camilla and Charles's feelings would no longer be denied. \"To most of the population,\" Christopher Wilson remarks, \"theirs was a passion which simply did not exist. But a privileged few were witness to an astonishing display of the almost animal attraction that the two now had for each other.\" At the Cirencester Polo Club Ball, he reports, the pair were seen \"kissing each other, French kissing, dance after dance\". On another occasion, a \"trusted friend\" reported, the heir to the throne was unable to resist the attractions of Camilla's favourite dress: \"Charles took one look at it, plunged his hands down the front and grabbed her breasts. In mixed company, that is not the done thing.\" Indeed not.</p> <p>Charles bought a new house, Highgrove, because it was close to Bolehyde Manor, the recently acquired seat of the Parker-Bowleses, and the magnetic twosome, now nicely settled, set about procuring the prince an official wife.</p> <p>Once Diana had been installed, the affair temporarily ceased, only to be reignited as the royal marriage disintegrated. \"Camilla was normal,\" contends Christopher Wilson. \"She was grown up. She was womanly, with voluptuous curves, not a bag of bones. She was sexually adventurous. And she was, in all truth, a very nice woman.\" Who could ask for more?</p> <p>As Charles later pointed out in a television interview, his marriage had \"irretrievably broken down\" by the time he and Camilla resumed extra-marital proceedings. Andrew Parker-Bowles was allegedly happy to try his luck elsewhere. Diana was enjoying riding lessons with James Hewitt. There was nothing - unless you count the princes and the Parker-Bowleses' children, and, perhaps, Charles's future as Defender of the Faith - to stand in the path of true love. Had Diana not told Morton about the arrangement, it might have gone on for years, even become the done thing. But in December 1992, six months after Morton's revelations, John Major announced a royal separation. Outside her house, Camilla gave a statement: \"If something has gone wrong I'm very sorry for them,\" she said. \"But I know nothing more than the average person in the street. I only know what I see on television.\"</p> <p>Her fib was exposed just a few weeks later when newspapers published a taped conversation between the Prince and Mrs Parker-Bowles. Camilla was not, it made clear, \"an average person in the street\". Unless, that is, average persons in the street are in the habit of calling Charles at midnight, and telling him they miss him desperately, desperately, desperately. There was more. Loyal subjects were touched by a section in which the faithful Bowles beseeched the Prince to let her see his latest speech. Most of the tape, however, comprised complicated arrangements for future assignations and lustful declarations. Camilla: \"I need you all the week, all the time.\" Charles: \"Oh, God, I'll just live inside your trousers or something.\" It was suggested, to their shared amusement, that Charles be reincarnated as a Tampax. So this was what animal magnetism sounded like.</p> <p>At the time, the tape seemed to constitute a blow from which the royal family - and Charles in particular - would never recover. How, after this, would the prince ever dare to lecture his subjects on aesthetics, on the English language, on spirituality? But the damage to the prince's reputation was short-lived. Within months of what could have been eternal disgrace, Prince Charles was droning away like 10 men, as if nothing had happened, on everything from the horrors of modern architecture to his role as \"Defender of the Divine\".</p> <p>In fact, those who wish the royal family would keep their opinions to themselves owe a debt of gratitude to Camilla Parker-Bowles. One might go further. Until the dreadful day earlier this month when Camilla was formally conversed with by the Queen, she was the model royal: shy, opinion-free, almost invisible. If she has opinions on GM foods, she is to be congratulated on not sharing them with us. If she cares, like her boyfriend, about Shakespeare, Islam and organic carrots, she has done the decent thing of never mentioning it. It was too good too last. Sooner or later, Camilla would have to become a role model, like her ghastly future in-laws. Not long after Diana's death, Charles's spivs got to work. Camilla was seen out and about, she was reputed to be tolerated by the young princes, and now, less than three years since she seemed to be doomed to life as a Chippenham-based anchoress, Camilla is inches away from public acceptability. The archbishop of Canterbury offers consolation over tea. She entertains Scottish prelates with her prince. Last week 68% of Mirror readers said she and Charles should marry. William Hill's odds on the pair getting hitched within a year have dropped to 6-4. Tabloids that would once have rejoiced to see her hung, drawn and quartered now scream, \"Marry her!\"</p> <p>If nothing is done, it is only a matter of time before Charles's privacy-loving helpmeet is up there beside him, planting trees, cutting ribbons, and preaching the joys of Islam, or reed-bed sanitation units, or whatever her partner's latest hobby happens to be. For however earthy, independent and sensible Camilla may be in other respects, when it comes to the massive folly of worshipping a twerp like Charles, she is peerless. Remember her \"great achievement\"? \"Your great achievement is to love me,\" Charles said, unbelievably, on that tape. And even more unbelievably, Camilla took it as a compliment. If only we could attribute it to her Goonish sense of humour.</p>",

On another occasion, a \"trusted friend\" reported, the heir to the throne was unable to resist the attractions of Camilla's favourite dress: \"Charles took one look at it, plunged his hands down the front and grabbed her breasts. In mixed company, that is not the done thing.\" Indeed not. Charles bought a new house, Highgrove, because it was close to Bolehyde Manor, the recently acquired seat of the Parker-Bowleses, and the magnetic twosome, now nicely settled, set about procuring the prince an official wife. Once Diana had been installed, the affair temporarily ceased, only to be reignited as the royal marriage disintegrated. \"Camilla was normal,\" contends Christopher Wilson. \"She was grown up. She was womanly, with voluptuous curves, not a bag of bones. She was sexually adventurous. And she was, in all truth, a very nice woman.\" Who could ask for more? As Charles later pointed out in a television interview, his marriage had \"irretrievably broken down\" by the time he and Camilla resumed extra-marital proceedings. Andrew Parker-Bowles was allegedly happy to try his luck elsewhere. Diana was enjoying riding lessons with James Hewitt. There was nothing - unless you count the princes and the Parker-Bowleses' children, and, perhaps, Charles's future as Defender of the Faith - to stand in the path of true love. Had Diana not told Morton about the arrangement, it might have gone on for years, even become the done thing. But in December 1992, six months after Morton's revelations, John Major announced a royal separation. Outside her house, Camilla gave a statement: \"If something has gone wrong I'm very sorry for them,\" she said. \"But I know nothing more than the average person in the street. I only know what I see on television.\" Her fib was exposed just a few weeks later when newspapers published a taped conversation between the Prince and Mrs Parker-Bowles. Camilla was not, it made clear, \"an average person in the street\". Unless, that is, average persons in the street are in the habit of calling Charles at midnight, and telling him they miss him desperately, desperately, desperately. There was more. Loyal subjects were touched by a section in which the faithful Bowles beseeched the Prince to let her see his latest speech. Most of the tape, however, comprised complicated arrangements for future assignations and lustful declarations. Camilla: \"I need you all the week, all the time.\" Charles: \"Oh, God, I'll just live inside your trousers or something.\" It was suggested, to their shared amusement, that Charles be reincarnated as a Tampax. So this was what animal magnetism sounded like. At the time, the tape seemed to constitute a blow from which the royal family - and Charles in particular - would never recover. How, after this, would the prince ever dare to lecture his subjects on aesthetics, on the English language, on spirituality? But the damage to the prince's reputation was short-lived. Within months of what could have been eternal disgrace, Prince Charles was droning away like 10 men, as if nothing had happened, on everything from the horrors of modern architecture to his role as \"Defender of the Divine\". In fact, those who wish the royal family would keep their opinions to themselves owe a debt of gratitude to Camilla Parker-Bowles. One might go further. Until the dreadful day earlier this month when Camilla was formally conversed with by the Queen, she was the model royal: shy, opinion-free, almost invisible. If she has opinions on GM foods, she is to be congratulated on not sharing them with us. If she cares, like her boyfriend, about Shakespeare, Islam and organic carrots, she has done the decent thing of never mentioning it. It was too good too last. Sooner or later, Camilla would have to become a role model, like her ghastly future in-laws. Not long after Diana's death, Charles's spivs got to work. Camilla was seen out and about, she was reputed to be tolerated by the young princes, and now, less than three years since she seemed to be doomed to life as a Chippenham-based anchoress, Camilla is inches away from public acceptability. The archbishop of Canterbury offers consolation over tea. She entertains Scottish prelates with her prince. Last week 68% of Mirror readers said she and Charles should marry. William Hill's odds on the pair getting hitched within a year have dropped to 6-4. Tabloids that would once have rejoiced to see her hung, drawn and quartered now scream, \"Marry her!\" If nothing is done, it is only a matter of time before Charles's privacy-loving helpmeet is up there beside him, planting trees, cutting ribbons, and preaching the joys of Islam, or reed-bed sanitation units, or whatever her partner's latest hobby happens to be. For however earthy, independent and sensible Camilla may be in other respects, when it comes to the massive folly of worshipping a twerp like Charles, she is peerless. Remember her \"great achievement\"? \"Your great achievement is to love me,\" Charles said, unbelievably, on that tape. And even more unbelievably, Camilla took it as a compliment. If only we could attribute it to her Goonish sense of humour.",

      "body": "<p>In the aftermath of the prime minister's brush with the WI, a poll yesterday showed Labour's lead over the Tories down to 3%. For the first time since he was elected leader of the Conservative party almost three years ago, it is now conceivable that William Hague will win the next election. Of course, the odds are still against it, but six months ago bookmakers weren't even taking bets. </p> <p>This should give the government and its supporters pause for thought. Labour needs to work out whether its strategy from here to polling day is to be for the prime minister to stand above politics and try to pull together a big-tent coalition or if it is prepared to make some enemies. Both avenues have been explored over the past month - by Gordon Brown in his attack on Oxbridge elitism and the prime minister with his WI speech - but neither has been conspicuously successful. However, the government runs the risk of appearing totally confused and rudderless if it tries to face both ways at once, so it has to choose between the two strategies. </p> <p>The strength of the economy remains Labour's most potent electoral weapon, and the Conservative party's biggest problem. So far, all we know about Hague's intentions is that he wants to match Labour's spending commitments on health and education but also give a guarantee that taxes will be cut. This is unlikely to stand up to the scrutiny of an election campaign, particularly if inflation remains low, unemployment is still falling and real incomes continue to rise. There should be a powerful feel-good factor working in the government's favour but, as John Major found in 1997, the old rule that parties are not turfed out when the economy is doing well no longer applies. Voters are more cynical and capricious than they were, and the government will be vulnerable unless it clarifies what its message is going to be. </p> <p>Labour has been in this position before. As Neal Lawson, the impeccably Blairite editor of Renewal, said recently, the prime minister's \"forces of conservatism\" speech at last year's party conference got under the skin of the right by giving them something to fear, but the government quickly rowed back.\"Instead of finally chucking someone out of the bloody tent, we backed down. We did not want to define the enemy.\" </p> <p>Lawson's conclusion is that the landslide of 1997 did not empower the government but rather imposed severe limits on what it could hope to achieve. \"Our challenge is to deepen our political roots, not to herd a flock of nervous sheep within the tent of 'one nation'. Satisfying no one for fear of offending anyone is unsustainable. We cannot continue being all things to all people.\" </p> <p>Brown's remarks certainly offended some people, not just on the right, which reacted with ferocity to the idea that the dice should stop being loaded in favour of the already privileged, but from the metropolitan left which, after whingeing for three years about New Labour's lack of radicalism, turned and fled at the first whiff of grapeshot. The chancellor, if we are to believe some of the hyperbolic guff written in the past couple of weeks, seized on the Laura Spence affair to relaunch the class war. </p> <p>In class-war terms, the notion that if state-school children account for two-thirds of those getting three As at A level they should get more than half the places at Oxbridge is hardly revolutionary.

      "bodyText": "In the aftermath of the prime minister's brush with the WI, a poll yesterday showed Labour's lead over the Tories down to 3%. For the first time since he was elected leader of the Conservative party almost three years ago, it is now conceivable that William Hague will win the next election. Of course, the odds are still against it, but six months ago bookmakers weren't even taking bets. This should give the government and its supporters pause for thought. Labour needs to work out whether its strategy from here to polling day is to be for the prime minister to stand above politics and try to pull together a big-tent coalition or if it is prepared to make some enemies. Both avenues have been explored over the past month - by Gordon Brown in his attack on Oxbridge elitism and the prime minister with his WI speech - but neither has been conspicuously successful. However, the government runs the risk of appearing totally confused and rudderless if it tries to face both ways at once, so it has to choose between the two strategies. The strength of the economy remains Labour's most potent electoral weapon, and the Conservative party's biggest problem. So far, all we know about Hague's intentions is that he wants to match Labour's spending commitments on health and education but also give a guarantee that taxes will be cut. This is unlikely to stand up to the scrutiny of an election campaign, particularly if inflation remains low, unemployment is still falling and real incomes continue to rise. There should be a powerful feel-good factor working in the government's favour but, as John Major found in 1997, the old rule that parties are not turfed out when the economy is doing well no longer applies. Voters are more cynical and capricious than they were, and the government will be vulnerable unless it clarifies what its message is going to be. Labour has been in this position before. As Neal Lawson, the impeccably Blairite editor of Renewal, said recently, the prime minister's \"forces of conservatism\" speech at last year's party conference got under the skin of the right by giving them something to fear, but the government quickly rowed back.\"Instead of finally chucking someone out of the bloody tent, we backed down. We did not want to define the enemy.\" Lawson's conclusion is that the landslide of 1997 did not empower the government but rather imposed severe limits on what it could hope to achieve. \"Our challenge is to deepen our political roots, not to herd a flock of nervous sheep within the tent of 'one nation'. Satisfying no one for fear of offending anyone is unsustainable. We cannot continue being all things to all people.\" Brown's remarks certainly offended some people, not just on the right, which reacted with ferocity to the idea that the dice should stop being loaded in favour of the already privileged, but from the metropolitan left which, after whingeing for three years about New Labour's lack of radicalism, turned and fled at the first whiff of grapeshot. The chancellor, if we are to believe some of the hyperbolic guff written in the past couple of weeks, seized on the Laura Spence affair to relaunch the class war. In class-war terms, the notion that if state-school children account for two-thirds of those getting three As at A level they should get more than half the places at Oxbridge is hardly revolutionary. It is the equivalent of a bit of guerilla action behind enemy lines. But it was portrayed as the first day of the Somme, with Field Marshal Brown sending the flower of Britain's privately educated officer corps over the top to be impaled on the barbed wire of egalitarianism and mown down by the machine gun fire of class envy. That the right should promulgate this tosh is par for the course. However, when the chancellor looked around for reinforcements from his friends on the left they were a bit thin on the ground.

      "body": "<p>In Poundbury, gravel is an issue. At first sight, raked across the wandering pavements of Prince Charles's ideal village in Dorset, the tiny stones give the streets an attractively dusty air. When the sun shines, the cottage shadows cut the roads into tourist-brochure triangles; you could almost be in Siena, the prince's favourite town in Tuscany. And when you walk in Poundbury, as you are much encouraged to, the pavements and old-fashioned squares and courtyards crunch beneath your feet. Every step seems a slightly formal public gesture. It feels like being at a royal garden party.</p> <p>It is not quite as special for the residents. Some of them have been here for six years now, while the prince's town planning experiment has grown from a handful of houses to 200, enduring the builders and visiting dignitaries, the peering tourists and reporters. Yet, more than anything, they are tired of the gravel.</p> <p>\"That fucking stuff goes into the house,\" says an otherwise cheery retired man in cords and an anorak. The woman he is talking to gestures at her front door. \"Everyone is doormat-obsessed,\" she says. \"Because of the gravel.\" It spreads across the narrow roads, forms drifts in the gutters, gets stuck under people's shoes. A tide of small stones lies halfway up her doormat. A few rogue fragments have almost made it to the carpet.</p> <p>The man interjects: \"Of course, there's a security upside. It makes it difficult for burglars.\" The village has barely suffered a break-in in its history, he says. The woman, who is younger, perhaps in her 30s, interrupts in turn. \"But you can't go round and sleep with your neighbour.\"</p> <p>The preoccupations and peculiarities of Poundbury, like those of its patron, have long exercised a certain fascination. From its conception in the late 80s, to the planning battles and compromises of the early 90s, to its painstaking expansion since 1993, this tight hilltop maze of white walls and beige stone has become a steadily more vivid metaphor for Charles's approaching rule.</p> <p>The local taxi drivers call it \"Charlieville\". To its critics, it is a royal vanity - social engineering driven by self-interest (Charles owns the land and profits from every house sale) and contradictory ideals (some properties are rented cheaply through a housing association, but the use of traditional building materials makes the others more expensive than the Dorset norm). Architectural authorities, in particular, point out that Poundbury is going up, fake antique brick by fake antique brick, just when public taste is finally turning to modernity. In the London Evening Standard last year, a panel of design writers chose Poundbury as one of \"The 99 Worst Things This Century\".</p> <p>But its supporters are swelling in number. Last month, a government report praised its densely clustered homes, attention to detail and emphasis on pedestrians as a healthy alternative to the usual suburban sprawl. In 1998, John Prescott visited. \"What is being done here,\" he said, \"is very important work for this country's urban future.\" Poundbury's theme-park quality - its cosy reproduction of features from existing ancient villages and market towns - may actually fulfil the desires of English house-buyers. With millions of new dwellings needed, especially in southern counties like Dorset, the prince's little prototype kingdom is planned to expand far beyond its current 400 subjects. It could, to different degrees, be the future for all of us.</p> <p>You approach it off a roundabout. Poundbury, like Charles, is not a self-contained entity but the latest addition to an ancient institution - in this case, the former Roman town of Dorchester. Poundbury is out by the bypass, beyond the genteel Georgian facades, the Victorian terraces and the 20s council houses. The weather on this side of town is locally described as \"draughty\".</p> <p>Amid the crisp new walls and doorstep plant pots, along the roads free of dustbins and litter and modern traffic markings, whole minutes pass without a pedestrian. The odd builder's van or resident's Volvo squeezes round the blind corners, grumpily changing gear. Barely another sound carries across the rooftops. In the squares, the benches stand expectant and unused. The prince's saplings rustle in the breeze.</p> <p>There is only one shop. A pub and cafe and corner shop are planned to open later this summer; until then, to gossip and get out of the rain, people have had to make do with an interior design showroom. The Stitchinghouse has no sign outside - Charles disapproves of gaudy shop fronts - and closes at four in the afternoon. At lunchtime, there are two people in the shop, discussing archery and Nigel Kennedy's failure to shave.</p> <p>Sue McCarthy-Moore, the owner, is sewing a quilted curtain attachment. She is very keen on Poundbury. \"I've lived here since the beginning,\" she says. \"It's safe. It's friendly . . . I like the attention to detail. I think it's nice not to have TV aerials and telegraph poles.\" In a loud, well-informed voice, she takes issue with a recent newspaper letter from the architect Richard Rogers criticising Poundbury. \"People here get interested in design. There's zero crime. People look out for each other.\" She picks up the cushion by one of its reproduction brass rings. \"At least Charles was brave enough to have a go.\"</p> <p>Her neighbours appear to agree. They are retired couples, many of them, who wear the country uniform of the prosperous: smart cardigans and cords, green quilted jackets and V-necked jumpers just like Charles's. For royalists, there are a reassuring number of Commonwealth citizens. A dapper man from Sydney is unloading books from a lorry. Is he worried about the wind? \"They're supposed to be very fuel efficient houses.\"</p> <p>Poundbury feels carefully worked out. There is a monthly organic market and an alternative medicine clinic. There is a business park, with factory buildings like Tuscan farm compounds, their ugly money-making ducts and pipes hidden behind red towers and pretty walls. There is a maker of \"fine chocolates\" and a cereal manufacturer promoting \"healthy eating\".</p> <p>The prince's every crusade and polemic is represented here in picture-postcard form. A manifesto of sorts has been inscribed on the inside of the Millennium Belvedere Tower, a small stone pavilion in a field on the southern edge of the settlement, quoting Clough Williams-Ellis, the architect of the utopian Welsh village Portmeirion: \"We must preserve what may be of our ancient heritage . . . that desolation be stayed, that standards of graciousness may here and there persist.\"</p> <p>The Poundbury ideal took shape during that great decade of revivals, the 80s. In 1984, the prince began attacking modern architecture and praising the \"eternal\", \"natural\" forms and ways of life that had only really existed in Britain before the Industrial Revolution. By 1989, with his television documentary and polemical volume, A Vision of Britain, a programme for rescuing his future kingdom from concrete and alienation had been devised. \"We do not have to live in surroundings that directly reflect the latest technology,\" he wrote. Instead, developments should be built \"on a more intimate scale\"; \"a sense of hierarchy\" should be restored to buildings; \"good lettering must be taught and learned\".</p> <p>To illustrate these principles, he would \"produce something of real beauty in the English countryside\". Through the Duchy of Cornwall, which had provided an income for male heirs to the throne since the 14th century, the prince owned large pockets of south-west England. One piece of land was outside Dorchester; the local council wanted to see houses built on it. The result was Poundbury.</p> <p>Its evolution has not been as natural as its royal overseer probably intended. Its Englishness, for one thing, was in question from the start: Leon Krier, the planner Charles chose, was from Luxembourg; and Krier's initial models imagined Poundbury as a perfect Italian town, with campaniles, rotundas and unlikely-looking trees from the Mediterranean. These grand designs had to be simplified and shrunk and made to reflect the settlement's cool, green surroundings. The property price slide of the early 90s slowed construction further.</p> <p>Yet nowadays, at the small Duchy outpost in Poundbury, modest satisfaction is the order of the day. The houses are selling. \"He's happy, I think - generally,\" says Simon Conibear, the development manager. Plans for buildings still go to the prince, but he consults before making his mind up. His exercise of power over the hilltop is \"constitutional\".</p> <p>As Charles's ambassador in the village, Conibear has two ways of behaving. Out in the street, in his old-fashioned suit, he strides through endless tours, greets locals, and even borrows a phrase from the anti-capitalist protests: \"We've reclaimed the streets from cars.\" But in his office, amid the bright lighting and decor that usually sits behind Poundbury facades, he is much more hard-headed. \"This is the most profitable development per acre in Dorchester,\" he says. He shows the plans for the settlement's ultimate shape: over 2,000 buildings, over 6,000 inhabitants, the current \"village\" a mere thumbnail. \"A few key houses with period detail,\" he says. \"Fill in the gaps with a lot of concrete blocks and render.\"</p> <p>Poundbury's air of quiet can deceive in other ways. It is, to an extent, an enforced calm: there are rules against ball games in public courtyards; rules against altering the outside of properties; a \u00a370 annual charge for the upkeep of the roadside trees and flowerbeds. And there is the residents' association. Attendance at meetings is high. Warnings are given about talking to reporters. References in the minutes to \"the Poundbury Concept\" are in capital letters. A recent minor bit of vandalism is crossly attributed to culprits \"not local to Poundbury\".</p> <p>Yet the place has its tensions. The social housing, to look at, is admirable: well built, no smaller than the rest, discreetly scattered. Young mothers and men with tattoos tend their flowers like everyone else. But the talk, in the clinic's pristine waiting room, is of \"slight trouble\". The two smartly dressed women murmur on: \"You can't have someone who's paid \u00a3250,000 for a house living next to someone who . . .\" They are both nodding before the end of the sentence.</p> <p>Poundbury would like to attract fewer wealthy retired people, Conibear says. Then, perhaps, the curtains will stop twitching when its small population of children scamper over the gravel. Then the unfriendly little notices against parking too close will stop going up on front doors. And the contradictory experiment of the contradictory prince, environmentalist and sports-car collector, estate-dweller and advocate of terraced housing, will work more smoothly. Until then, after the builders have gone in the evenings, two small boys with golf clubs are determined, it seems, to use the prince's buildings for target practice.</p>",

      "bodyText": "In Poundbury, gravel is an issue. At first sight, raked across the wandering pavements of Prince Charles's ideal village in Dorset, the tiny stones give the streets an attractively dusty air. When the sun shines, the cottage shadows cut the roads into tourist-brochure triangles; you could almost be in Siena, the prince's favourite town in Tuscany. And when you walk in Poundbury, as you are much encouraged to, the pavements and old-fashioned squares and courtyards crunch beneath your feet. Every step seems a slightly formal public gesture. It feels like being at a royal garden party. It is not quite as special for the residents. Some of them have been here for six years now, while the prince's town planning experiment has grown from a handful of houses to 200, enduring the builders and visiting dignitaries, the peering tourists and reporters. Yet, more than anything, they are tired of the gravel. \"That fucking stuff goes into the house,\" says an otherwise cheery retired man in cords and an anorak. The woman he is talking to gestures at her front door. \"Everyone is doormat-obsessed,\" she says. \"Because of the gravel.\" It spreads across the narrow roads, forms drifts in the gutters, gets stuck under people's shoes. A tide of small stones lies halfway up her doormat. A few rogue fragments have almost made it to the carpet. The man interjects: \"Of course, there's a security upside. It makes it difficult for burglars.\" The village has barely suffered a break-in in its history, he says. The woman, who is younger, perhaps in her 30s, interrupts in turn. \"But you can't go round and sleep with your neighbour.\" The preoccupations and peculiarities of Poundbury, like those of its patron, have long exercised a certain fascination. From its conception in the late 80s, to the planning battles and compromises of the early 90s, to its painstaking expansion since 1993, this tight hilltop maze of white walls and beige stone has become a steadily more vivid metaphor for Charles's approaching rule. The local taxi drivers call it \"Charlieville\". To its critics, it is a royal vanity - social engineering driven by self-interest (Charles owns the land and profits from every house sale) and contradictory ideals (some properties are rented cheaply through a housing association, but the use of traditional building materials makes the others more expensive than the Dorset norm). Architectural authorities, in particular, point out that Poundbury is going up, fake antique brick by fake antique brick, just when public taste is finally turning to modernity. In the London Evening Standard last year, a panel of design writers chose Poundbury as one of \"The 99 Worst Things This Century\". But its supporters are swelling in number. Last month, a government report praised its densely clustered homes, attention to detail and emphasis on pedestrians as a healthy alternative to the usual suburban sprawl. In 1998, John Prescott visited. \"What is being done here,\" he said, \"is very important work for this country's urban future.\" Poundbury's theme-park quality - its cosy reproduction of features from existing ancient villages and market towns - may actually fulfil the desires of English house-buyers. With millions of new dwellings needed, especially in southern counties like Dorset, the prince's little prototype kingdom is planned to expand far beyond its current 400 subjects. It could, to different degrees, be the future for all of us. You approach it off a roundabout. Poundbury, like Charles, is not a self-contained entity but the latest addition to an ancient institution - in this case, the former Roman town of Dorchester. Poundbury is out by the bypass, beyond the genteel Georgian facades, the Victorian terraces and the 20s council houses. The weather on this side of town is locally described as \"draughty\". Amid the crisp new walls and doorstep plant pots, along the roads free of dustbins and litter and modern traffic markings, whole minutes pass without a pedestrian. The odd builder's van or resident's Volvo squeezes round the blind corners, grumpily changing gear. Barely another sound carries across the rooftops. In the squares, the benches stand expectant and unused. The prince's saplings rustle in the breeze. There is only one shop. A pub and cafe and corner shop are planned to open later this summer; until then, to gossip and get out of the rain, people have had to make do with an interior design showroom. The Stitchinghouse has no sign outside - Charles disapproves of gaudy shop fronts - and closes at four in the afternoon. At lunchtime, there are two people in the shop, discussing archery and Nigel Kennedy's failure to shave. Sue McCarthy-Moore, the owner, is sewing a quilted curtain attachment. She is very keen on Poundbury. \"I've lived here since the beginning,\" she says. \"It's safe. It's friendly . . . I like the attention to detail. I think it's nice not to have TV aerials and telegraph poles.\" In a loud, well-informed voice, she takes issue with a recent newspaper letter from the architect Richard Rogers criticising Poundbury. \"People here get interested in design. There's zero crime. People look out for each other.\" She picks up the cushion by one of its reproduction brass rings. \"At least Charles was brave enough to have a go.\" Her neighbours appear to agree. They are retired couples, many of them, who wear the country uniform of the prosperous: smart cardigans and cords, green quilted jackets and V-necked jumpers just like Charles's. For royalists, there are a reassuring number of Commonwealth citizens. A dapper man from Sydney is unloading books from a lorry. Is he worried about the wind? \"They're supposed to be very fuel efficient houses.\" Poundbury feels carefully worked out. There is a monthly organic market and an alternative medicine clinic. There is a business park, with factory buildings like Tuscan farm compounds, their ugly money-making ducts and pipes hidden behind red towers and pretty walls. There is a maker of \"fine chocolates\" and a cereal manufacturer promoting \"healthy eating\". The prince's every crusade and polemic is represented here in picture-postcard form. A manifesto of sorts has been inscribed on the inside of the Millennium Belvedere Tower, a small stone pavilion in a field on the southern edge of the settlement, quoting Clough Williams-Ellis, the architect of the utopian Welsh village Portmeirion: \"We must preserve what may be of our ancient heritage . . . that desolation be stayed, that standards of graciousness may here and there persist.\" The Poundbury ideal took shape during that great decade of revivals, the 80s. In 1984, the prince began attacking modern architecture and praising the \"eternal\", \"natural\" forms and ways of life that had only really existed in Britain before the Industrial Revolution. By 1989, with his television documentary and polemical volume, A Vision of Britain, a programme for rescuing his future kingdom from concrete and alienation had been devised. \"We do not have to live in surroundings that directly reflect the latest technology,\" he wrote. Instead, developments should be built \"on a more intimate scale\"; \"a sense of hierarchy\" should be restored to buildings; \"good lettering must be taught and learned\". To illustrate these principles, he would \"produce something of real beauty in the English countryside\". Through the Duchy of Cornwall, which had provided an income for male heirs to the throne since the 14th century, the prince owned large pockets of south-west England. One piece of land was outside Dorchester; the local council wanted to see houses built on it. The result was Poundbury. Its evolution has not been as natural as its royal overseer probably intended. Its Englishness, for one thing, was in question from the start: Leon Krier, the planner Charles chose, was from Luxembourg; and Krier's initial models imagined Poundbury as a perfect Italian town, with campaniles, rotundas and unlikely-looking trees from the Mediterranean. These grand designs had to be simplified and shrunk and made to reflect the settlement's cool, green surroundings. The property price slide of the early 90s slowed construction further. Yet nowadays, at the small Duchy outpost in Poundbury, modest satisfaction is the order of the day. The houses are selling. \"He's happy, I think - generally,\" says Simon Conibear, the development manager. Plans for buildings still go to the prince, but he consults before making his mind up. His exercise of power over the hilltop is \"constitutional\". As Charles's ambassador in the village, Conibear has two ways of behaving. Out in the street, in his old-fashioned suit, he strides through endless tours, greets locals, and even borrows a phrase from the anti-capitalist protests: \"We've reclaimed the streets from cars.\" But in his office, amid the bright lighting and decor that usually sits behind Poundbury facades, he is much more hard-headed. \"This is the most profitable development per acre in Dorchester,\" he says. He shows the plans for the settlement's ultimate shape: over 2,000 buildings, over 6,000 inhabitants, the current \"village\" a mere thumbnail. \"A few key houses with period detail,\" he says. \"Fill in the gaps with a lot of concrete blocks and render.\" Poundbury's air of quiet can deceive in other ways. It is, to an extent, an enforced calm: there are rules against ball games in public courtyards; rules against altering the outside of properties; a \u00a370 annual charge for the upkeep of the roadside trees and flowerbeds. And there is the residents' association. Attendance at meetings is high. Warnings are given about talking to reporters. References in the minutes to \"the Poundbury Concept\" are in capital letters. A recent minor bit of vandalism is crossly attributed to culprits \"not local to Poundbury\". Yet the place has its tensions. The social housing, to look at, is admirable: well built, no smaller than the rest, discreetly scattered. Young mothers and men with tattoos tend their flowers like everyone else. But the talk, in the clinic's pristine waiting room, is of \"slight trouble\". The two smartly dressed women murmur on: \"You can't have someone who's paid \u00a3250,000 for a house living next to someone who . . .\" They are both nodding before the end of the sentence. Poundbury would like to attract fewer wealthy retired people, Conibear says. Then, perhaps, the curtains will stop twitching when its small population of children scamper over the gravel. Then the unfriendly little notices against parking too close will stop going up on front doors. And the contradictory experiment of the contradictory prince, environmentalist and sports-car collector, estate-dweller and advocate of terraced housing, will work more smoothly. Until then, after the builders have gone in the evenings, two small boys with golf clubs are determined, it seems, to use the prince's buildings for target practice.",

Until his position is confirmed, it is unlikely that Bashar - or anyone else in Syria - will be able to make serious moves in the peace process. That in itself may well frustrate Washington's goal of striking a deal before the US presidential election.</p> <p>The negotiations with Israel stalled over a few yards of land at the foot of the Golan Heights - occupied by Israel in 1967 - on the shores of Lake Galilee, with Syria insisting on access to the lake, though not the use of its waters. Various fudges have been proposed unofficially which might satisfy both parties, but Israel has been reluctant to consider them without a signal from Damascus that such a deal would bring \"warm peace\" between the two countries - something that Hafez Assad was probably incapable of delivering.</p> <p>This view was echoed by the Palestinian peace negotiator Saeb Erekat, who said yesterday that it would be hard for any successor in Syria to be flexible in future peace talks with Israel because of Assad's uncompromising legacy.</p> <p>\"President Assad's legacy was that a full peace with Israel meant full withdrawal of Israel to the 1967 borders. I don't think anyone in Syria will come and accept anything less than this,\" Mr Erekat said in an interview.</p> <p>\"And therefore Israel has to realise that to make peace means it has to withdraw to the June 1967 borders on both the Syrian and Palestinian tracks,\" he said.</p> <p>Bashar might be more amenable, but whether he is prepared to adopt a different approach will depend largely on how secure he feels back home.</p> <p>The Israeli government argues that it will have difficulty selling a withdrawal from Golan to the public, but this would become easier if Syria were to make a dramatic ice-breaking gesture - something like the historic visit that the late Egyptian president, Anwar Sadat, paid to Israel.</p> <p>But Assad, along with many other Arabs, regarded Sadat's visit to Jerusalem as a mistake and argued that successful negotiations should end with handshakes, not start with them. \"I am not Anwar Sadat and it is not my ambition to become Yasser Arafat,\" he was quoted as telling President Clinton last March. The Syrians also suspected that they were being stampeded into a compromise by the US-Israeli timetable merely to help salvage President Clinton's reputation.</p> <p>There are two alternative scenarios of how Bashar's succession might affect the present stalemate. One is that he will need more time to consolidate his power and that he will try to avoid any decisions that, in the eyes of the Syrian establishment, his father would have disagreed with. If that turns out to be the case, the Syrian track may remain on hold for a year or two.</p> <p>The other scenario is that with his more open character, he may feel that the time has come to solve the problem that dogged his father's presidency for so many years. He would, however, have to secure favourable terms with the Israelis or his domestic position would be undermined.</p> <p>There is also the question of Syria's Siamese twin: Lebanon, where Bashar's initial weakness will increase pressure from Israel, and perhaps more subtly from the Lebanese, to withdraw Syrian troops. Israel has been taunting Syria on this point ever since it withdrew its own troops from southern Lebanon last month. The Syrians are also unpopular with Lebanese citizens, many of whom would like to see the back of them but are reluctant to say so in public.</p> <p>Syria can, however, claim to be a stabilising influence in Lebanon - pointing out that it helped to prevent the predicted turmoil following the Israeli withdrawal. President Assad generally judged the Lebanese situation shrewdly. Whether Bashar will be able to handle Lebanon so skilfully may depend on whether he is diverted by challenges at home.</p>",

That in itself may well frustrate Washington's goal of striking a deal before the US presidential election. The negotiations with Israel stalled over a few yards of land at the foot of the Golan Heights - occupied by Israel in 1967 - on the shores of Lake Galilee, with Syria insisting on access to the lake, though not the use of its waters. Various fudges have been proposed unofficially which might satisfy both parties, but Israel has been reluctant to consider them without a signal from Damascus that such a deal would bring \"warm peace\" between the two countries - something that Hafez Assad was probably incapable of delivering. This view was echoed by the Palestinian peace negotiator Saeb Erekat, who said yesterday that it would be hard for any successor in Syria to be flexible in future peace talks with Israel because of Assad's uncompromising legacy. \"President Assad's legacy was that a full peace with Israel meant full withdrawal of Israel to the 1967 borders. I don't think anyone in Syria will come and accept anything less than this,\" Mr Erekat said in an interview. \"And therefore Israel has to realise that to make peace means it has to withdraw to the June 1967 borders on both the Syrian and Palestinian tracks,\" he said. Bashar might be more amenable, but whether he is prepared to adopt a different approach will depend largely on how secure he feels back home. The Israeli government argues that it will have difficulty selling a withdrawal from Golan to the public, but this would become easier if Syria were to make a dramatic ice-breaking gesture - something like the historic visit that the late Egyptian president, Anwar Sadat, paid to Israel. But Assad, along with many other Arabs, regarded Sadat's visit to Jerusalem as a mistake and argued that successful negotiations should end with handshakes, not start with them. \"I am not Anwar Sadat and it is not my ambition to become Yasser Arafat,\" he was quoted as telling President Clinton last March. The Syrians also suspected that they were being stampeded into a compromise by the US-Israeli timetable merely to help salvage President Clinton's reputation. There are two alternative scenarios of how Bashar's succession might affect the present stalemate. One is that he will need more time to consolidate his power and that he will try to avoid any decisions that, in the eyes of the Syrian establishment, his father would have disagreed with. If that turns out to be the case, the Syrian track may remain on hold for a year or two. The other scenario is that with his more open character, he may feel that the time has come to solve the problem that dogged his father's presidency for so many years. He would, however, have to secure favourable terms with the Israelis or his domestic position would be undermined. There is also the question of Syria's Siamese twin: Lebanon, where Bashar's initial weakness will increase pressure from Israel, and perhaps more subtly from the Lebanese, to withdraw Syrian troops. Israel has been taunting Syria on this point ever since it withdrew its own troops from southern Lebanon last month. The Syrians are also unpopular with Lebanese citizens, many of whom would like to see the back of them but are reluctant to say so in public. Syria can, however, claim to be a stabilising influence in Lebanon - pointing out that it helped to prevent the predicted turmoil following the Israeli withdrawal. President Assad generally judged the Lebanese situation shrewdly. Whether Bashar will be able to handle Lebanon so skilfully may depend on whether he is diverted by challenges at home.",

      "body": "<p>I was being driven back from Hay-on-Wye to London one gorgeous morning in late May when, just as the motorway traffic began to thicken, we spotted a royal limousine immediately ahead. A crest and shield, and a flag or standard, and the opaque numberplate AEI were the only exterior clues to the occupant. The head in the rear window appeared to be female and white-haired, and I thought - because after all, my God, there are so many of them - is that Princess Alexandra? Or Princess Michael of Kent? Or some other noble pensioner (of the sort you often hear described as \"the hangers-on\")?</p> <p>My driver, who I am pleased to say was perfectly indifferent, indulged my faint curiosity and so, until some turn-off near Windsor, we were sometimes right behind the royal progress, occasionally in front of it, and more than once cruising right alongside.</p> <p>The experience of being a republican has, over the last decade or so, rather resembled that encounter. There have been moments - the revelations about tax-dodging, the horrors of Prince Philip's diplomacy in China, the endless matrimonial squalor and tedium - when one has thought, yes, we're finally leaving them behind. And there have been moments - the Blair-scripted Palace concession to the cortege of Princess Diana, for example - when it has seemed that populism and royalism are joined at the hip and cannot be put asunder.</p> <p>Much of the time, though, the House of Windsor is only in society's peripheral vision; marginally relevant to the regional and constitutional metamorphosis through which we are passing, almost completely irrelevant to the European dimension, and fulfilling neither the \"dignified\" nor the \"efficient\" parts of the role that Walter Bagehot famously assigned to it.</p> <p>Yet even the appearance of a slow decline into mediocrity may be deceptive. In the next two months, we will be subjected - we are, after all, subjects - to birthday celebrations of the only two \"royals\" who approach anything like the charismatic. One of them, as I cannot pretend not to know, will be 100 and the other, as I was actually quite startled to learn, will be 18. Of the old lady of Clarence House, I have nothing to say; literally nothing occurs to me. She appears to have had a goodish innings. Of the presumptive next king but one, I also lack an opinion. I have nothing to go on. He is, however, physically quite hauntingly reminiscent of his departed mama. I wonder what the gloomy old Balmoral faction thinks, and how the gloomy old Balmoral faction feels, when it surveys this blond and fluted and gentle-seeming reminder of the neurotic girl who was so ill-used, and whose name was struck out of the Church of England's prayers for the royal family a few weeks before she died, and who was stripped of her coveted title as a Royal Highness.</p> <p>What it may think and feel, of course, is that God is in some way still on its side. What a piece of uncanny good fortune, that a Prince Charming should have survived what looked like an irretrievable moral and public relations wreck, to become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the very \"Firm\" which repudiated his mother. It's almost enough to make one superstitious. Just as the centenarian is making her final arrangements, and just as the thought of Charles remaining in waiting until he is 70 becomes a distinct possibility, a cherubic distraction is suddenly offered free, gratis and for nothing, and the encrusted old oil painting is cleaned to reveal a blithe and hitherto unsuspected figure.</p> <p>What excellent timing, then, for the Prince of Wales to attempt another trial run with the only woman he's ever given a damn about. On the Sunday following my encounter with that shapely Daimler or Humber, my Sunday Times informed me of a high-level rapprochement at Highgrove between Her Majesty and Camilla Parker-Bowles. It informed me of this by the expedient of making it the splash front-page lead. (Whenever I even think of wavering in my republicanism, or of weakening in the long and unequal struggle, I am confirmed anew by this sort of thing. The monarchy should be abolished if only for the no-brainer effect it has on my profession, and the excruciating banality of the automatic \"lead\" stories that it dishes out.)</p> <p>The dinner or luncheon at which this excitement occurred was in honour of the 60th birthday of one Constantine, falsely described as \"the exiled King of Greece\". He is not an exiled king but an ex-king, having been booted out in a democratic referendum in 1974, and having been lucky to escape heavier punishment for swearing in a fascist military dictatorship in 1967. His Nazi-loving aunt, the former Queen Frederika, was Prince Philip's favourite relative. They order these things better in Greece. Here, we have a succession crisis but don't have the fortitude or honesty to admit it; we hobble along with neither a serious monarchy, nor a self-respecting democracy, but in a quasi-presidential regime with silly royalist trappings.</p> <p>We are not allowed a referendum on the future of our monarchy, but we are allowed the illusion of a say by means of the opinion poll. Voting in the passive voice is the best we can expect, as we consider the role and function of the only family in the country that still holds formal political power by right of birth. (An odd family to pick, one might say, except that we didn't pick it.) When asked in the recent Guardian poll whether they would prefer the Queen's son or grandson to succeed her in the certain event of her death or the improbable contingency of her abdication, an impressive number of respondents seem already prepared to skip the Charles experience altogether. (Not that they have been asked, or can hope to be consulted.) Even more interesting, the combined votes of the anti-monarchists and the don't care faction actually outweigh the opinion - held by only 44% - of those who feel that Britain would be worse off without the monarchy.</p> <p>These figures fluctuate vertiginously. But the crucial point, the one to keep your eye on, is this: win or lose, up or down, the monarchy is now an issue. This may not seem so surprising to the 18-24 age group, which reports itself as 40% against the continuation of royalism (24% in favour) but to someone of my advanced years, there is something staggering about it.</p> <p>As late as at least 1980, and possibly later, no such vulgar probe of public opinion was ever undertaken, or even thought of. The House of Windsor enjoyed the nirvana state of being the apex of our system, while remaining miraculously suspended \"above politics\". That dreamland has dissipated forever. In 1988, Tom Nairn and I made a TV documentary, eventually screened in the small hours, of his path-breaking republican book The Enchanted Glass. We seemed, to ourselves and others, as quixotic as the village atheist in some Bible Belt state. The monarchy was a given; a still centre in a turning world. Now, in Tom's beloved Scotland, it is at best a piece of obvious veneer. And I can barely remember the last time that my espousal of republican views got me into any kind of hot water.</p> <p>So to the question we used to ask ourselves - will we live long enough to see them off? - the answer is, in one way, that we already have. The easy, natural, semi-automatic authority and affection have departed. They can no more be revived than the Church of England, or the reputation of Barings, or the letters page of the Times, or the Conservative and Unionist Party.</p> <p>Which is why I fret about this lad William. With a part of myself, and with a son not far from him in age, I want to fold him in a manly embrace and beseech him not to waste his life mouldering in the ante-chambers to a hollow crown and a vestigial throne. See what it did to your parents? To your Great Aunt Margaret? To your Auntie Annie? Flee while there is yet time; dash the envenomed chalice to the flagstones; mount up and move to California!</p> <p>With another part of myself, I dread him and I cringe away. If he becomes the unscripted agent of a royal revival, then we are in for the worst of all cultural worlds: the alliance of a discredited hereditary principle with showbiz values and celebrity style. The last time that happened, we got the swinging Edward VIII - a fiesta of narcissism and nastiness (cheered on as a \"breath of fresh air\", lest we forget, by many liberals) from which only the most dogged and feudal and obscurantist forces ultimately rescued us. We must be able to do better than that choice.</p> <p>An old English radical slogan has it that the problem is not the will of some to power, but the will of others to obey. I think that it's literally true that many people can't imagine life without the Windsors. And my quarrel is with that very mentality, much more than it is with any actual or potential monarch. One doesn't wish to demolish people's household gods, or rip away their comfort blankets, but couldn't they be just as happy as Jacobites once were, cultivating nostalgia and illusion while leaving the rest of us to get on with it?</p> <p>The experience of being a monarchist in a British republic, or should I say a federation of English and Scottish and Welsh and Irish republics, might be quite an agreeable one. The pictures of the beloved Queen Mum over the fireplace, the display of Coronation mugs, the tea towels from that cruelly phoney wedding service in 1981 - all these could retain their iconic status. They might even mean more, once they were cut free of a ridiculous feather-bedding subsidy. And they wouldn't have to be officially inflicted upon those who can't any longer bear the sight of them. Parliament could open itself, surely, without permission. Life in general would muddle on.</p> <p>And what would we put in its place? People obviously need something transcendent; only a philistine denies it. My proposal has always been a reconfiguration of Westminster Abbey. Abolish the patronising name Poet's Corner, and make it into a shrine for our language and literature. Much but not all of this tradition of poetry and prose - Milton, Shelley, Burns, Byron, Wilde - is republican already, as well as reflecting the glories of the Scots and Irish and Welsh. That would be something to show the schoolchildren and (since monarchists always insist on this for some reason) the tourists, too.</p> <p>Am I dreaming? Not as much as those who think that the Windsors can renew their depleted blood supply from the Spencers. <br><br>Christopher Hitchens is a columnist for Vanity Fair and The Nation. His book The Monarchy: A Critique of Britain's Favourite Fetish, was published in 1989.</p>",

So to the question we used to ask ourselves - will we live long enough to see them off? - the answer is, in one way, that we already have. The easy, natural, semi-automatic authority and affection have departed. They can no more be revived than the Church of England, or the reputation of Barings, or the letters page of the Times, or the Conservative and Unionist Party. Which is why I fret about this lad William. With a part of myself, and with a son not far from him in age, I want to fold him in a manly embrace and beseech him not to waste his life mouldering in the ante-chambers to a hollow crown and a vestigial throne. See what it did to your parents? To your Great Aunt Margaret? To your Auntie Annie? Flee while there is yet time; dash the envenomed chalice to the flagstones; mount up and move to California! With another part of myself, I dread him and I cringe away. If he becomes the unscripted agent of a royal revival, then we are in for the worst of all cultural worlds: the alliance of a discredited hereditary principle with showbiz values and celebrity style. The last time that happened, we got the swinging Edward VIII - a fiesta of narcissism and nastiness (cheered on as a \"breath of fresh air\", lest we forget, by many liberals) from which only the most dogged and feudal and obscurantist forces ultimately rescued us. We must be able to do better than that choice. An old English radical slogan has it that the problem is not the will of some to power, but the will of others to obey. I think that it's literally true that many people can't imagine life without the Windsors. And my quarrel is with that very mentality, much more than it is with any actual or potential monarch. One doesn't wish to demolish people's household gods, or rip away their comfort blankets, but couldn't they be just as happy as Jacobites once were, cultivating nostalgia and illusion while leaving the rest of us to get on with it? The experience of being a monarchist in a British republic, or should I say a federation of English and Scottish and Welsh and Irish republics, might be quite an agreeable one. The pictures of the beloved Queen Mum over the fireplace, the display of Coronation mugs, the tea towels from that cruelly phoney wedding service in 1981 - all these could retain their iconic status. They might even mean more, once they were cut free of a ridiculous feather-bedding subsidy. And they wouldn't have to be officially inflicted upon those who can't any longer bear the sight of them. Parliament could open itself, surely, without permission. Life in general would muddle on. And what would we put in its place? People obviously need something transcendent; only a philistine denies it. My proposal has always been a reconfiguration of Westminster Abbey. Abolish the patronising name Poet's Corner, and make it into a shrine for our language and literature. Much but not all of this tradition of poetry and prose - Milton, Shelley, Burns, Byron, Wilde - is republican already, as well as reflecting the glories of the Scots and Irish and Welsh. That would be something to show the schoolchildren and (since monarchists always insist on this for some reason) the tourists, too. Am I dreaming? Not as much as those who think that the Windsors can renew their depleted blood supply from the Spencers. Christopher Hitchens is a columnist for Vanity Fair and The Nation. His book The Monarchy: A Critique of Britain's Favourite Fetish, was published in 1989.",

      "bodyText": "British American Tobacco faces an official inquiry into allegations that it actively encouraged and profited from cigarette smuggling after a cross-party committee of MPs agreed to demand an investigation into the London-based company. A source close to Stephen Byers, the trade and industry secretary, said he is likely to be \"sympathetic\" to the committee's call for DTI inspectors to be appointed for what could be an explosive investigation of the tobacco industry. A unanimous report by the Commons health select committee, to be published on Wednesday, will ask Mr Byers to act under section 432 of the Companies Act. Inspectors would have the power to go through BAT's books and quiz current and former staff under oath about accusations of suspected fraud and the withholding of information from shareholders by the world's second biggest tobacco company. The report, endorsed without dissent by the committee's Labour, Liberal Democrat and Conservative members, also strongly criticises advertising by most tobacco firms, claiming that it tries to ensnare non-smokers - directly contradicting industry assurances that advertisements try only to persuade current smokers to switch brands. Concern will be voiced about the harmful effect of tobacco additives and the government will be put under pressure to improve the industry's regulatory framework. MPs on the committee, which is chaired by Labour's David Hinchliffe, took the unusual step of taking evidence in person from the tobacco company's chairman, Martin Broughton, three times. The all-party group is believed to have been dissatisfied with alleged inconsistencies between his replies and those of Kenneth Clarke, the former Conservative chancellor of the exchequer, who is now BAT's vice chairman, about smuggling on the one hand and internal company documents on the other. BAT papers disclosed in the Guardian earlier this year suggested that senior executives encouraged smuggling around the world, despite the com pany's insistence that it was opposed to the practice. The company has already set up an internal inquiry into the allegations. A BAT spokesman said the company had consistently denied allegations that it promoted smuggling. \"We don't know what the committee will recommend until Wednesday,\" said the spokesman. \"If [a DTI investigation] is among the recommendations then we do not believe it is either necessary nor appropriate.\" But Clive Bates, director of the anti-smoking group, Ash, said: \"The great thing about a DTI inquiry is they can question employees, former employees and associates of BAT under oath.

Which, in money terms, isn't much. As the Bentley rolls through the front entrance, he vanishes to order. </p> <p>\"They're almost here,\" shouts an excitable doctor. </p> <p>\"Just as well. I'm freezing,\" says another senior bod, with a seditious rub of his hands. </p> <p>We are waiting in two lines at the King George V entrance. One line is for the anaesthetists. The other sad, diminished line is for the journalists - the Press Association's royal correspondent, his photographer, and me. The Princess Royal doesn't like the hack pack. Never has done. </p> <p>In 1962, when she was 12, Anne was on holiday and took an introverted turn for the worse. \"Princess upset by overexuberance of French photographers\" read one headline. The media may have been a less ferocious beast in those days, but as far as Anne was concerned it was still very much a beast. Every incident in her life was dutifully reported. In January 1964, we learned that \"Princess Anne joined with other local youngsters in a paper chase on ponies in Sandringham woods\". A year later \"Princess Anne stayed indoors at Valduz castle with a slight cold\". </p> <p>It has to be said that the hack pack has never cared much for Anne, either. As a young woman she was considered aloof, abrupt, staid. As a woman approaching 50, she is respected as the hardest-working royal - close on 500 official engagements in Britain last year. Respected, but hardly liked. </p> <p>The Guardian has put in a request to Buckingham Palace. We'd like to follow Anne for two or three days, snatch a few words between openings. Felicity Murdo-Smith, her PA, takes a week to reach a decision. No way. Perhaps I could observe her at the British Knitting and Clothing Export Council where, as president, she will attend the AGM? Felicity says that's up to the knitters. Sorry, say the knitters, private do. What about the preview of Christie's sporting art sale which she will attend as president of the Animal Health Trust? 'Fraid not, says Christie's; private. Surely the Worshipful Company of Farmers will allow me to attend lunch with Anne, their Junior Warden? Maybe not, but they promise to send on all the bumf. </p> <p>Despair is setting in when St Bartholomew's say they'd be delighted to entertain me. Of course there's no chance of talking to Anne, but they're happy to let me share a room with her as she opens the simulation centre. </p> <p>Anne steps out of the Bentley, a vision in yellow. We follow her past the Queen Elizabeth II wing. It must be strange, forever shadowing your heritage; there's Mum, Great Granddad, Great-Great-Great-Grandma. Every stop is punctuated by handshakes. Actually, only Anne shakes hands; the dignitaries are shaking a black glove. I ask Peter Archer, the Press Association's royal correspondent, whether she wears gloves because she doesn't want to be polluted by the masses. No, he says - if you had to shake as many hands as she does, your digits would get sore. He says the Queen goes through a pair a day. In his six years on the job, Anne has never uttered a word to Peter. Diana, of course, would often stroll over for a chat, and since her death Charles has learned to do the same. Anne's way of acknowledging him is to walk past, head buried in her chest. He admires her for it, says she is her father's daughter: no-nonsense, businesslike. What, though, is her business? </p> <p>Anne became president of the Save the Children Fund at 19. Now she is patron of 222 organisations. She has said that her role is to make the most of her position; to burst into the offices of corporate bosses, grab them by the ears and demand what they can do for her starving children. </p> <p>A handful of prize-winners are invited to shake Anne's glove. \"How long have you been here?\" she asks. Whenever Anne asks a question, she bounces on her feet. As she listens she clenches and unclenches her hand behind her back. Maybe the gloves irritate her. </p> <p>The ceremony climaxes with the unveiling of a plaque. Anne draws back the curtain. \"The Medical Simulation Centre, opened by HRH the Princess Royal, 25th May 2000.\" She stands to the side, proofreads and nods. </p> <p>A crowd of patients has gathered in the drizzle to wave her off. Some are in pyjamas, and one has a drip attached. She doesn't seem to have seen them. They disperse, walk back to their wards, say it would have been nice if she'd waved back. </p> <p> <b> Friday May 26, Queen Anne's School, Reading</b> </p> <p> The palace laughs when I ask to attend the European Forum for Victim Services reception at Windsor Castle. But not even Felicity can banish me from the opening of the sports centre at Queen Anne's School. A sporting day for a sporting woman. In 1971 she won the European three-day event at Burghley. That year she was named Britain's sportswoman of the year, and was the subject of a series of profiles. Anne didn't fit an easy stereotype. Some said she was sullen, peeved that she wasn't going to be queen. Others said she was happy to be a maverick from the Hemingway school of adventurers. </p> <p>On the train, I jot down questions, just in case. Which event has meant most to her in the past week? Does she ever wish she had a normal job? Does she prefer to be called Your Royal Highness, or Ma'am, or Annie? Are any of her friends republicans? </p> <p>On the few occasions she does grant interviews, it is to advance her own agenda. Last week she talked to trade magazine The Grocer to say that GM foods are quite groovy, actually, and put one over on her elder brother. Interviewees have to submit questions beforehand, and the sheet is returned with all but the anodyne lashed out. </p> <p>Queen Anne's is a girls' public school, \u00a312,500 a year. After years of planning, the day has turned into a disaster. It's pissing down. The fireworks are cancelled; the parents, cooped up in the library, are trying to make the best of it. \"This is bad luck for them. Dreadful. Every time I put on my boots the heavens open,\" says one man, flicking the rain from his face. </p> <p>The sports centre is magnificent. In the gym, 14 girls are engaged in an abdominal workout. Anne is 15 minutes late, and by the time she arrives, they are exhausted. We move off to the basketball court, lacrosse, aerobics, the rockery. Anne occasionally pauses to ask that question: \"How long have you been at this school?\" </p> <p>As Anne talks to the children, she bounces on her heels, clenching and unclenching her gloved hands. Many people say she can be funny and spiky and irreverent, yet she is loath to show it in public. As if it were beneath her dignity. As well as the horses, she's a fine lacrosse player, a crack shot on the shooting range. She once broke Patrick Lichfield's lap record on his private speedway circuit. How can she watch those girls chucking basketballs and not ask for a shot? Perhaps she worries that the girls will go home and say: \"I met Princess Anne and she was a right good laugh.\" </p> <p>I'm within hugging distance of her. Just as my mouth opens for the first question, a discreet security man ushers me back towards the stairs. </p> <p>Anne starts her speech with a joke. \"May I point out that the Princess Royal who visited here in 1929 was not me.\" She congratulates the school for the sports centre, then draws back the velvet curtain. The plaque tells her what she has just done. She stands to the side, reads and nods her approval. </p> <p>\"What's the point of her coming here?\" says 18-year-old Rowena Barber. \"If she was coming to raise some money, maybe. But she isn't.\" Her friend, Catherine Davison, agrees. \"If this was a state school, fair enough. A visit from royalty could show them they are valued. But feeling undervalued isn't a problem here.\" </p> <p>The two head girls are giving Anne an upbeat send-off. \"Three cheers for the prin-\" They stop, realising they have botched the protocol, and start again. \"Three cheers for Her Royal Highness. Hip hip, hoorah!\" </p> <p>A rope divides the princess and sporting volunteers from the mass of pupils. Row after row bend an ear to listen. After her speech, she shakes gloves with the headmistress and leaves without a glance in their direction. Anne looks like she needs a good ironing. </p> <p> <b> Wednesday May 31, Hammersmith and Fulham Carers' Centre</b> </p> <p> Felicity gets quite unpleasant when I suggest asking Anne a few questions about her work with carers. \"No, no, no! \" she says. \"I've already told your colleague you can't interview her. No! \" I tell Felicity she is not allowing us to see the princess in her best light. </p> <p>The carers' centre is a place where all ages come for respite - some look after elderly partners, some are kids looking after their families. A photographer in the waiting room is complaining about his treatment. \"The policeman on the door said, 'How do I know you're a photographer?' and I said, 'Because I've got a press card that says photographer, issued by the Metropolitan police.'\" </p> <p>I ask the administrator how long they've been preparing for the big day. \"Oh, months,\" she says. \"It's been murder! We've had the whole of the outside painted, and that was just the start.\" It reminds me of the time when Rajiv Ghandi was visiting a rainy suburb of Delhi, and the local authority had the pavements raised for him. </p> <p>In the corner, Albert the clown is teaching the children circus skills. Daniel Meekings is balancing on an iron globe. He's seven, the youngest carer at the centre, and looks after his deaf sister. Does he know who Anne is? He spreads his hand in baffled awe. \"Her family rules the country.\" </p> <p>It's four days since I last saw Anne. In the meantime she's changed her gloves and attended the Army Families Federation Conference and the commemoration of the new roof of the choir of Paisley Abbey in Scotland. She seems more animated today, and praises the kids' homework club. \"It's not eashy to conshentrate on school. Care is about creating time for yourshelves.\" It's taken me a week to realise who that deep, slurred voice reminds me of: Bill Deedes. A girl presents her with a bouquet. It looks the same as the last one. What does she do with them all? Does she like flowers? </p> <p>She smiles at a little girl and for a second I think she's going to swoop her up and drop a big sloppy kiss on her cheek. Instead, she bounces on her feet, flexes her hand and asks how long she has been coming to the centre. The trouble is that Anne refuses to acknowledge she is in the PR business - PR for her charities and, these days, PR for her family. The only way she can measure herself is by the money raised for her causes. And there is nothing the hospital or the public school or the carers' centre would like more than a soft-focus newspaper picture of a sunny princess fighting their corner. </p> <p>A while ago, Anne was interviewed about her work for Save the Children. The interviewer, desperate for colour, asked for one memory that stood out, one anecdote. She refused to provide it, implying that it would be invidious. But perhaps it all begins to merge. Perhaps, like many of us, she lives a Groundhog Day existence. She was once asked what she would have done if she'd not been a princess. She said she'd like to have been a long-distance lorry driver. </p> <p>It's time to leave. Another day's work done. The plaque is unveiled. She opens the velvet curtain. \"To commemorate the visit of her Royal Highness the Princess Royal to the Hammersmith and Fulham Carers' Centre on Wednesday 31st May 2000.\" She stands to the side, reads , and nods her approval. \"Smashing,\" she says.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Thursday May 25, Medical Simulation Centre, St Bartholomew's Hospital \"Could you brush away the water?\" says the senior anaesthetist. \"I'm worried about the little depression collecting in the pavement.\" The hospital cleaner scrubs for all he's worth. Which, in money terms, isn't much. As the Bentley rolls through the front entrance, he vanishes to order. \"They're almost here,\" shouts an excitable doctor. \"Just as well. I'm freezing,\" says another senior bod, with a seditious rub of his hands. We are waiting in two lines at the King George V entrance. One line is for the anaesthetists. The other sad, diminished line is for the journalists - the Press Association's royal correspondent, his photographer, and me. The Princess Royal doesn't like the hack pack. Never has done. In 1962, when she was 12, Anne was on holiday and took an introverted turn for the worse. \"Princess upset by overexuberance of French photographers\" read one headline. The media may have been a less ferocious beast in those days, but as far as Anne was concerned it was still very much a beast. Every incident in her life was dutifully reported. In January 1964, we learned that \"Princess Anne joined with other local youngsters in a paper chase on ponies in Sandringham woods\". A year later \"Princess Anne stayed indoors at Valduz castle with a slight cold\". It has to be said that the hack pack has never cared much for Anne, either. As a young woman she was considered aloof, abrupt, staid. As a woman approaching 50, she is respected as the hardest-working royal - close on 500 official engagements in Britain last year. Respected, but hardly liked. The Guardian has put in a request to Buckingham Palace. We'd like to follow Anne for two or three days, snatch a few words between openings. Felicity Murdo-Smith, her PA, takes a week to reach a decision. No way. Perhaps I could observe her at the British Knitting and Clothing Export Council where, as president, she will attend the AGM? Felicity says that's up to the knitters. Sorry, say the knitters, private do. What about the preview of Christie's sporting art sale which she will attend as president of the Animal Health Trust? 'Fraid not, says Christie's; private. Surely the Worshipful Company of Farmers will allow me to attend lunch with Anne, their Junior Warden? Maybe not, but they promise to send on all the bumf. Despair is setting in when St Bartholomew's say they'd be delighted to entertain me. Of course there's no chance of talking to Anne, but they're happy to let me share a room with her as she opens the simulation centre. Anne steps out of the Bentley, a vision in yellow. We follow her past the Queen Elizabeth II wing. It must be strange, forever shadowing your heritage; there's Mum, Great Granddad, Great-Great-Great-Grandma. Every stop is punctuated by handshakes. Actually, only Anne shakes hands; the dignitaries are shaking a black glove. I ask Peter Archer, the Press Association's royal correspondent, whether she wears gloves because she doesn't want to be polluted by the masses. No, he says - if you had to shake as many hands as she does, your digits would get sore. He says the Queen goes through a pair a day. In his six years on the job, Anne has never uttered a word to Peter. Diana, of course, would often stroll over for a chat, and since her death Charles has learned to do the same. Anne's way of acknowledging him is to walk past, head buried in her chest. He admires her for it, says she is her father's daughter: no-nonsense, businesslike. What, though, is her business?

A handful of prize-winners are invited to shake Anne's glove. \"How long have you been here?\" she asks. Whenever Anne asks a question, she bounces on her feet. As she listens she clenches and unclenches her hand behind her back. Maybe the gloves irritate her. The ceremony climaxes with the unveiling of a plaque. Anne draws back the curtain. \"The Medical Simulation Centre, opened by HRH the Princess Royal, 25th May 2000.\" She stands to the side, proofreads and nods. A crowd of patients has gathered in the drizzle to wave her off. Some are in pyjamas, and one has a drip attached. She doesn't seem to have seen them.

      "body": "<b> Ekow Eshun, journalist</b> <p> I met the Queen two years ago at a Buckingham Palace reception for young achievers attended by most of the royal family. Unexpectedly, I found myself being introduced to her and, stuck for something to say, I told her she had a lovely home. She nodded. Rising to my theme, I gazed out of the palace windows at the vast acreage of lawn outside with its own private lake and complimented her on the grounds. \"Yes, one is very lucky to have a garden in the centre of London,\" she replied. This struck me as a bit of an understatement. Before I could point this out, she'd moved on. She was very short with perfectly coiffured silver hair. There was something very slick, almost showbiz, about how polished she looked and the way she worked the room. </p> <p> <b> Russell Stannard, scientist and ex-professor of physics</b> </p> <p> I was invited to lunch with the Queen at Buckingham Palace last spring. I was on the Queen's left. Michael Atherton was on the other side. The corgis were at our feet. Throughout the meal, she dropped down pieces of toast. We spoke about the Uncle Albert books I write for children, and about science and religion, because she and Prince Philip listen to Thought For The Day, and I often give that. I asked her how many corgis she had, and she said they weren't all corgis, some of them were dorgis. She explained that that was a cross between a corgi and a dachshund. </p> <p> <b> Dickie Bird, ex-cricket commentator</b> </p> <p> I had lunch with the Queen at Buckingham Palace on November 27 1990. It was a marvellous occasion, because there were only three or four of us. She asked me if I had had a good journey down, and I said: \"Yes, I have, your Majesty. I left at five this morning from Barnsley.\" And she laughed and said: \"Oh dear, you definitely made sure you were going to be early.\" I said: \"Yes, I would not have missed this for anything. I would have walked it from Barnsley to Buckingham Palace to have lunch with you.\" She had a good laugh over that. She asked me if I had enjoyed the lunch, and I said I had, it was a magnificent lunch. She asked had I enjoyed the day. I said: \"Yes, I have, it's a day that I will cherish for the rest of my life.\" I've met the Queen about 28 times, but that time will stand out. I was there all day. </p> <p> <b> Larry Adler, harmonica player</b> </p> <p> It was at an event called The Great Event, like a royal variety show, at Earl's Court. After the show, the Queen came back to meet the cast. As she got to me I said: \"I played for you when you were 12.\" And she said: \"Oh, where was that?\" I said: \"Edinburgh. You sat on the floor with your sister and your parents sat behind you.\" There was a long pause and I think she was thinking of something regal to say. Then finally she said, \"How kind of you to remember so far back\", and went on to the next artist. </p> <p> <b> Andrew Festing, artist</b> </p> <p> I painted her twice. Each time there were six sittings of about an hour, in the yellow drawing room at Buckingham Palace. On one occasion, she was just about to go to America on a state visit, so she spent a certain amount of time talking about that. It was just after that mortar bomb attack on 10 Downing St. There was a certain amount of talk about that, and the security at Buckingham Palace. Then we had a long conversation about what sort of rifles the army had. I remember us peering out of the windows and having a long conversation about the large numbers of Japanese tourists there. I think that was just after the emperor of Japan had been here. We had a long conversation, too, about some virus which had got into the stables. All the horses were suffering from some sort of epidemic. The conversations were completely normal. She's incredibly easy to talk to. After the initial part, the conversation flows in a perfectly normal way, like it does with anybody else. </p> <p> <b> Tim Cunningham, TV producer </b> </p> <p> I was captain of the school at Eton in 1990. They had a big celebration for the 550th anniversary of the school and the Queen came. I had to give a speech in Latin. I was introduced to her before and we had a quick chat about the fact I was giving it in Latin. So she asked me about the speech and about how long it was going to be. And that was about it. It was one of those swift, move-along things. </p> <p> <b> Claire Brown, reflexologist</b> </p> <p> It was November 1997. I was running touchy-feely type courses in Oxfordshire: hand massage, reflexology. All the TV crew came in and put the lights on, and I remember saying: \"No, you mustn't do this. She's coming to me to relax. It's not a show. She's coming to see how I normally operate.\" I remember her gliding in and going: \"Oh, isn't it lovely, a beautiful atmosphere here.\" I said: \"Excuse me ma'am, would you like me to show you what a little hand massage is?\" She answered to the effect of: \"Yes please, I'd love to.\" I made her an oil up of frankincense, rose and mandarin; rose because she was the Queen, the symbol of England; frankincense because it's a lovely, calming one; and mandarin because it's a lovely, uplifting one. I remember her saying: \"How soothing, how relaxing. I'm having a lovely time.\" Halfway through working on her hands, I suddenly thought: \"Oh my golly, this is the Queen!\" </p> <p> <b> Ron Freeman, investment banker</b> </p> <p> I met the Queen in 1992 at the new European Bank of Reconstruction &amp; Development (EBRD) headquarters in Broadgate. She came when it signed the new lease for the building. She asked if they were terribly busy with the EBRD. She made a point of speaking in French to Jacques Attali, the organisation's president, saying she was very pleased to have the EBRD in London. Her French was good but with an upper-class British accent. She was soft-spoken and polite. She said she hoped they were comfortable in the new headquarters. This turned out to be rather ironic as the FT criticised the EBRD for spending more on their lobby than on Europe, leading to Attali's departure. </p> <p> <b> Maureen Davies, primary school teacher</b> </p> <p> I met her at Buckingham Palace last February to receive the CBE for services to education. The sense of occasion overwhelms you. You have already been told the protocol, where you curtsey, move forward and she shakes your hand. So she shook my hand and said: \"Very well done, well deserved, and congratulations.\" I said: \"Oh, thank you very much. I feel very proud to be here.\"</p>",

We spoke about the Uncle Albert books I write for children, and about science and religion, because she and Prince Philip listen to Thought For The Day, and I often give that. I asked her how many corgis she had, and she said they weren't all corgis, some of them were dorgis. She explained that that was a cross between a corgi and a dachshund. Dickie Bird, ex-cricket commentator I had lunch with the Queen at Buckingham Palace on November 27 1990. It was a marvellous occasion, because there were only three or four of us. She asked me if I had had a good journey down, and I said: \"Yes, I have, your Majesty. I left at five this morning from Barnsley.\" And she laughed and said: \"Oh dear, you definitely made sure you were going to be early.\" I said: \"Yes, I would not have missed this for anything. I would have walked it from Barnsley to Buckingham Palace to have lunch with you.\" She had a good laugh over that. She asked me if I had enjoyed the lunch, and I said I had, it was a magnificent lunch. She asked had I enjoyed the day. I said: \"Yes, I have, it's a day that I will cherish for the rest of my life.\" I've met the Queen about 28 times, but that time will stand out. I was there all day. Larry Adler, harmonica player It was at an event called The Great Event, like a royal variety show, at Earl's Court. After the show, the Queen came back to meet the cast. As she got to me I said: \"I played for you when you were 12.\" And she said: \"Oh, where was that?\" I said: \"Edinburgh. You sat on the floor with your sister and your parents sat behind you.\" There was a long pause and I think she was thinking of something regal to say. Then finally she said, \"How kind of you to remember so far back\", and went on to the next artist. Andrew Festing, artist I painted her twice. Each time there were six sittings of about an hour, in the yellow drawing room at Buckingham Palace. On one occasion, she was just about to go to America on a state visit, so she spent a certain amount of time talking about that. It was just after that mortar bomb attack on 10 Downing St. There was a certain amount of talk about that, and the security at Buckingham Palace. Then we had a long conversation about what sort of rifles the army had. I remember us peering out of the windows and having a long conversation about the large numbers of Japanese tourists there. I think that was just after the emperor of Japan had been here. We had a long conversation, too, about some virus which had got into the stables. All the horses were suffering from some sort of epidemic. The conversations were completely normal. She's incredibly easy to talk to. After the initial part, the conversation flows in a perfectly normal way, like it does with anybody else. Tim Cunningham, TV producer I was captain of the school at Eton in 1990. They had a big celebration for the 550th anniversary of the school and the Queen came. I had to give a speech in Latin. I was introduced to her before and we had a quick chat about the fact I was giving it in Latin. So she asked me about the speech and about how long it was going to be. And that was about it. It was one of those swift, move-along things. Claire Brown, reflexologist It was November 1997. I was running touchy-feely type courses in Oxfordshire: hand massage, reflexology. All the TV crew came in and put the lights on, and I remember saying: \"No, you mustn't do this. She's coming to me to relax. It's not a show. She's coming to see how I normally operate.\" I remember her gliding in and going: \"Oh, isn't it lovely, a beautiful atmosphere here.\" I said: \"Excuse me ma'am, would you like me to show you what a little hand massage is?\" She answered to the effect of: \"Yes please, I'd love to.\" I made her an oil up of frankincense, rose and mandarin; rose because she was the Queen, the symbol of England; frankincense because it's a lovely, calming one; and mandarin because it's a lovely, uplifting one. I remember her saying: \"How soothing, how relaxing. I'm having a lovely time.\" Halfway through working on her hands, I suddenly thought: \"Oh my golly, this is the Queen!\" Ron Freeman, investment banker I met the Queen in 1992 at the new European Bank of Reconstruction &amp; Development (EBRD) headquarters in Broadgate. She came when it signed the new lease for the building. She asked if they were terribly busy with the EBRD. She made a point of speaking in French to Jacques Attali, the organisation's president, saying she was very pleased to have the EBRD in London. Her French was good but with an upper-class British accent. She was soft-spoken and polite. She said she hoped they were comfortable in the new headquarters. This turned out to be rather ironic as the FT criticised the EBRD for spending more on their lobby than on Europe, leading to Attali's departure. Maureen Davies, primary school teacher I met her at Buckingham Palace last February to receive the CBE for services to education. The sense of occasion overwhelms you. You have already been told the protocol, where you curtsey, move forward and she shakes your hand. So she shook my hand and said: \"Very well done, well deserved, and congratulations.\" I said: \"Oh, thank you very much. I feel very proud to be here.\"",

Sunday Times The food and drinks group Diageo is offering a huge incentive package for an e-commerce supremo to look over its international business-to-business internet subsidiary. The deal involves a basic salary of \u00a3250,000 plus an option of more than 1% of the new company. A \u00a32bn merger proposal to acquire Liberty International and its 74%-owned subsidiary, Capital Shopping Centres , has been put forward by British Land property group chairman John Ritblat. The offer was made before Mr Ritblat acquired 29.9% of Liberty last weekend. The Observer The diamond mining company Oryx has axed its UK flotation plans after the Foreign Office stepped in against a backdrop of Britain's intervention in the Sierra Leone crisis. It is understood the government voiced concerns over the company's $1bn (\u00a3667m) mining concession in the Congo, formerly Zaire. Virgin hopes to pip Orange at the post in the race to go global in mobile telephony with $2bn worth of international joint ventures.

IoS The French luxury goods tycoon Bernard Arnault may sell his 20.6% stake in Gucci to arch-rival Fran\u00e7ois Pinault . This would mean that Giorgio Armani would be clear to sell his brand to Gucci for an estimated \u20ac1bn. He did not want to sell while Arnault, a personal friend, was embroiled in a dispute over Gucci with Pinault. Gordon Brown will reveal a figure thought to be near \u00a3140bn in the Comprehensive Spending Review as part of a 10-year transport strategy.

Despite an extensive revamp of the centres in Skegness, Minehead and Bognor Regis, sources at the company say that a buyer is being sought. Mail on Sunday Sainsbury is to axe its Reward card after it cost the company \u00a3100m last year. Sir Peter Davis, the new chief executive, thinks the cost is too great. The move is part of an attempt to buck up the company's falling performance. Safeway scrapped its ABC card in April and its share price subsequently rose 22%. Britain's largest tour operator, Airtours, has started merger talks with Germany's C&amp;N Touristic . Airtours is already in talks with LTU , Germany's third largest tour operator. Sainsbury, Tesco and Budgens are competing to build stores in 2,500 suburban railway stations across Britain.

Senior aides to the Prince of Wales issued a statement saying they will refer the issue to the Press Complaints Commission this week for intrusion after the newspaper published a series of pictures taken by a paparazzo accused by Diana, Princess of Wales, of making her life \"hell\". The photographs, showing the prince mixing with his friends and playing sport at Eton in the run up to his 18th birthday on June 21, were taken by freelance photographer Mark Saunders. It is the second clash over photographs of the prince in a matter of days. Last Friday, Prince Charles's press secretary of seven years, Sandy Henney, resigned following a dispute with the Daily Telegraph over the copyright of the official photographs marking the birthday. Media experts said the News of the World's decision was a clear breach of the PCC code of conduct. The code was tightened following Diana's death in 1997 to restrict all intrusions into her sons' private lives until they were 18. The pictures - published six days ahead of the scheduled publication this Saturday of the official set of photographs - were taken from a forthcoming book about the prince featuring pictures by Mr Saunders, a paparazzo who trailed Diana daily for the last six years of her life and was accused of regularly \"hounding\" her to tears. The PCC chairman, Lord Wakeham, is likely to be sympathetic to the palace's concerns. He has in the past called for the code to be extended until the princes finish their full-time education around the age of 21.

So Gordon Brown's decision to raise the universal state pension by a generous 75p a week must have been welcome news to the 74-year-old inhabitant of a modest little pile at SW1A 1AA, bringing her weekly income to an estimated \u00a3678,846.75.</p> <p>Or thereabouts. The real story behind the Queen's wealth is how successfully Buckingham Palace has managed to avoid embarrassing disclosures about the size of her loot. Somewhere in a tax office in Cardiff, where all the most sensitive returns are dealt with, there is a man or woman who knows more or less how much Elizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor is worth. Everybody else is taking wild guesses, ranging from an estimate of \u00a32.18bn, in Eurobusiness magazine last year, to Fortune magazine, which has her sitting pretty on a \u00a35bn nest egg.</p> <p>In fact, the Queen's dosh can be roughly divided into the bits we have no idea about - her private investment portfolio, where estimates range from \u00a3100m to \u00a31.1bn - and the bits we know about but aren't really sure who owns: the Crown Estate, the Duchy of Lancaster, her jewels, stamp collection and the fabulous art collection which includes 9,000 paintings, 28,000 watercolours, and 20,000 pen-and-ink drawings, including sketches by Raphael and Da Vinci.</p> <p>The Sunday Times used to include the value of the collection - valuations range from \u00a3600m to \u00a34bn - in her fortune, but they caved in to pressure from the Palace and dropped the paintings on the rather shaky grounds that, as she can't sell them, she doesn't really own them.</p> <p>It is an argument the Palace uses frequently to knock down some of the wilder estimates of her wealth. Thus, for example, the official Buckingham Palace website states that the jewellery, art and royal palaces belong to the Queen as sovereign, not as an individual, and thus should be excluded from estimates of her wealth. They must be handed down to the next monarch, and cannot be sold off to raise a quick bob or pay off the Queen Mum's overdraft - or so the Palace says.</p> <p>In fact, it's not quite that clearcut. Some of the jewellery was bought by individual sovereigns; Queen Mary snapped up the Russian imperial family's baubles at bargain-basement prices during the Depression, which suggests that her granddaughter should be free to sell them. Estimates of the value of the jewellery range from \u00a370-\u00a3130m, although if they were ever auctioned off the bidding would go much higher than the face value of the stones, simply because of who used to wear them.</p> <p>Likewise, the palace was furious when the Eurobusiness survey included the Crown Estate in its estimate of the family's wealth. The estate consists of some 380,000 acres of prime land and buildings throughout the United Kingdom, valued at \u00a31.1bn.</p> <p>So who owns it? Under a settlement reached in 1760, the monarchy surrenders the Crown Estate to government at the start of each reign in exchange for payments to cover its expenses - the civil list. The Treasury pockets the revenues from the Crown Estate - \u00a3125.8m in 1998-99 - while the civil list has been set at \u00a39.79m annually since 1990. It sounds like a sweetheart deal for the taxpayer and, every so often, the palace murmurs that perhaps it should take back the revenues from the Crown Estate in exchange for covering all its own costs. But if the royals think they are entitled to the income from the Crown Estate, that surely suggests they think they still own it, despite claiming not to?</p> <p>Phillip Hall, historian and expert on the royal finances, says that the argument for giving the income from the Crown Estate back to the royals is disingenuous. Before George III handed over the Estate, the monarchy used the revenues to cover all the expenses of running the country apart from going to war. \"The Crown Estate income has always been for paying the expenses of government,\" says Hall. \"When the monarch was effectively the government, that is the basis on which he or she received the income. It was never private income. Now that the government is the state, the state receives it.\"</p> <p>So if the Palace wants to take back the Crown Estate revenues, it should cough up the \u00a3200bn annual costs of running a modern government. Not such a good deal, perhaps.</p> <p>The Duchy of Lancaster is another mysterious part of the royal port-folio: 51,150 acres of land and at least \u00a335m worth of investments run like a government department, with a minister at its head, currently the Cabinet Office minister, Mo Mowlam. But all the money it generates - \u00a35.9m a year - goes to the Queen. \"That she draws this revenue suggests that it is her private property, yet when the Palace calculates her private wealth they never include [it],\" says Hall. Eurobusiness didn't include it in their estimate of the Windsors' wealth, either.</p> <p>The one clear piece of the puzzle is the property that the Queen owns as an individual rather than a monarch: Sandringham and Balmoral, conservatively estimated as being worth around \u00a3100m.</p> <p>The most shadowy part of the Queen's finances is her personal fortune. Since 1993, she has paid tax on her private income - the fruits of her investment portfolio and the income from her private estates - but aside from that anonymous tax official in Cardiff, it's anyone's guess how much the bill is because no one can be sure how large her investments are.</p> <p>The most accurate figure - or at least, a figure that the Palace did not dispute at the time - was that, in 1971, her portfolio was worth around \u00a321m. Conservatively invested, this would now be worth around \u00a3861m, according to investment bankers CSFB. Standard Life, meanwhile, values her portfolio at \u00a31.25bn. However, the palace regularly denies that she is worth anything like this much, pointing out that she has drawn down on her capital at various times. Sources close to the palace suggest that the true value of the portfolio is more likely to be around \u00a3100m.</p> <p>As well as the annual income from her investments and the Duchy of Lancaster, the government provides the Queen with a sum known as the civil list, which the Palace insists is not a salary but a grant to cover some of the costs of being royal.

      "bodyText": "When you are a pensioner, every little counts. So Gordon Brown's decision to raise the universal state pension by a generous 75p a week must have been welcome news to the 74-year-old inhabitant of a modest little pile at SW1A 1AA, bringing her weekly income to an estimated \u00a3678,846.75. Or thereabouts. The real story behind the Queen's wealth is how successfully Buckingham Palace has managed to avoid embarrassing disclosures about the size of her loot. Somewhere in a tax office in Cardiff, where all the most sensitive returns are dealt with, there is a man or woman who knows more or less how much Elizabeth Alexandra Mary Windsor is worth. Everybody else is taking wild guesses, ranging from an estimate of \u00a32.18bn, in Eurobusiness magazine last year, to Fortune magazine, which has her sitting pretty on a \u00a35bn nest egg. In fact, the Queen's dosh can be roughly divided into the bits we have no idea about - her private investment portfolio, where estimates range from \u00a3100m to \u00a31.1bn - and the bits we know about but aren't really sure who owns: the Crown Estate, the Duchy of Lancaster, her jewels, stamp collection and the fabulous art collection which includes 9,000 paintings, 28,000 watercolours, and 20,000 pen-and-ink drawings, including sketches by Raphael and Da Vinci. The Sunday Times used to include the value of the collection - valuations range from \u00a3600m to \u00a34bn - in her fortune, but they caved in to pressure from the Palace and dropped the paintings on the rather shaky grounds that, as she can't sell them, she doesn't really own them. It is an argument the Palace uses frequently to knock down some of the wilder estimates of her wealth. Thus, for example, the official Buckingham Palace website states that the jewellery, art and royal palaces belong to the Queen as sovereign, not as an individual, and thus should be excluded from estimates of her wealth. They must be handed down to the next monarch, and cannot be sold off to raise a quick bob or pay off the Queen Mum's overdraft - or so the Palace says. In fact, it's not quite that clearcut.

Security forces were confident they could deal with the increased trouble which accompanies the marching season as it would be concentrated into a four-day period. But last week the Portadown Orangemen applied to the Parades Commission, the independent body which rules on contentious demonstrations, to march on July 2. They said they had a right to parade then since the annual service commemorated both William's victory and those people killed at the Somme, on July 1, 1916. They announced at the weekend that they had given the Parades Commission 28 days' notice to march down the Garvaghy Road on July 9 as well. That will mean another headache for the RUC and army, and thousands of troops are expected to be drafted in from Britain to help them cope.

A spokeswoman stressed that there was no risk to safety after an estimated 150,000 people crossed the bridge in the first two days. \"There is a team of engineers looking very carefully at the bridge and assessing what the problem is. As soon as we know what the cause of the movement is, we will tell people what we are going to do about it,\" she said.</p> <p>David Bell, chairman of the trust, apologised to people who might have felt discomfort crossing the bridge. \"The current problem, which involves excessive movement on the bridge in certain conditions, is something that we will overcome,\" he said.</p> <p>\"We are in discussions with the engineers to find out the exact cause. It is something that we will put right.\"</p> <p>Despite earlier statements indicating the crossing was \"100% safe\", engineers conceded that they will have to combat the movement which left some visitors complaining of sickness. \"We know what we've got to do, and there are measures we can take to sort this out,\" said one senior member of the team.</p> <p>Saturday's closure came when people, alarmed at the movement of the structure, alerted police. \"We anticipated 10,000 people on Saturday, but we think we had about 100,000 over the bridge,\" the spokesman said.</p> <p>\"We are satisfied we have now come up with a system to deal with these crowds. We will have someone down at the bridge to monitor the crowds.\"</p> <p>Access to the bridge was restricted yesterday as about 50,000 people queued for up to 30 minutes to cross in groups of 60 at two-minute intervals.</p> <p>The footbridge is London's first new river crossing for over 100 years. A cooperative design by Foster and Partners, sculptor Sir Anthony Caro and engineers Ove Arup and Partners, the bridge is also the longest horizontal suspension bridge ever built. A spokesman for Foster and Partners said: \"The bridge is intended to have some movement. It's a suspension bridge - if there isn't movement there can be a problem.\"</p> <p>The swaying problem comes a month after the bridge was inaugurated by the Queen, who was unable to cross the bridge because it had not been completed, and stopped some way short of the south bank.</p> <p>While organisers hope the problem is little more than a hiccup on a project that has been widely praised for its elegance and environmental credentials - Ken Livingstone, the mayor of London, has praised it for being pedestrian friendly - the setback is the latest to afflict the capital's millennium projects.</p> <p>The dome at Greenwich has suffered from poor attendances while the opening of the London Eye, the giant observation wheel on the south bank of the Thames overlooking Westminster, was delayed after problems with the pods.</p> <p>Visitors yesterday appeared untroubled by the swaying, which is most marked at the southern end where the central walkway forks into two ramps down to the river bank. Mark Munro of Edinburgh said that for his son Jamie the swaying had added to the fun.</p> <p>\"He thinks it's a fairground ride - it's a terrific looking thing but it feels quite safe.\"</p>",

A spokeswoman stressed that there was no risk to safety after an estimated 150,000 people crossed the bridge in the first two days. \"There is a team of engineers looking very carefully at the bridge and assessing what the problem is. As soon as we know what the cause of the movement is, we will tell people what we are going to do about it,\" she said. David Bell, chairman of the trust, apologised to people who might have felt discomfort crossing the bridge. \"The current problem, which involves excessive movement on the bridge in certain conditions, is something that we will overcome,\" he said. \"We are in discussions with the engineers to find out the exact cause. It is something that we will put right.\" Despite earlier statements indicating the crossing was \"100% safe\", engineers conceded that they will have to combat the movement which left some visitors complaining of sickness. \"We know what we've got to do, and there are measures we can take to sort this out,\" said one senior member of the team. Saturday's closure came when people, alarmed at the movement of the structure, alerted police. \"We anticipated 10,000 people on Saturday, but we think we had about 100,000 over the bridge,\" the spokesman said. \"We are satisfied we have now come up with a system to deal with these crowds. We will have someone down at the bridge to monitor the crowds.\" Access to the bridge was restricted yesterday as about 50,000 people queued for up to 30 minutes to cross in groups of 60 at two-minute intervals. The footbridge is London's first new river crossing for over 100 years. A cooperative design by Foster and Partners, sculptor Sir Anthony Caro and engineers Ove Arup and Partners, the bridge is also the longest horizontal suspension bridge ever built. A spokesman for Foster and Partners said: \"The bridge is intended to have some movement. It's a suspension bridge - if there isn't movement there can be a problem.\" The swaying problem comes a month after the bridge was inaugurated by the Queen, who was unable to cross the bridge because it had not been completed, and stopped some way short of the south bank. While organisers hope the problem is little more than a hiccup on a project that has been widely praised for its elegance and environmental credentials - Ken Livingstone, the mayor of London, has praised it for being pedestrian friendly - the setback is the latest to afflict the capital's millennium projects. The dome at Greenwich has suffered from poor attendances while the opening of the London Eye, the giant observation wheel on the south bank of the Thames overlooking Westminster, was delayed after problems with the pods. Visitors yesterday appeared untroubled by the swaying, which is most marked at the southern end where the central walkway forks into two ramps down to the river bank. Mark Munro of Edinburgh said that for his son Jamie the swaying had added to the fun. \"He thinks it's a fairground ride - it's a terrific looking thing but it feels quite safe.\"",

It is not possible to make a sensible assessment of that issue without asking a more fundamental question: what kind of king does the country need?</p> <p>While there is now, according to much of the evidence, no real enthusiasm for a republic, there is certainly a range of views about the monarchy and its future. There are large numbers of citizens who are very critical of the personal behaviour of some individual members of the royal family. They also criticise the present financial arrangements whereby the taxpayer pays about twice as much as other Europeans pay for their royal families. (Do the Windsors really need five palaces as well as Sandringham and Balmoral?) As a reaction to much unfavourable publicity in the 1990s, the royal \"firm\" set up a small working party - the Way Ahead Group - to improve their public image, but there is little indication that they seriously considered the preparation of William for his future role. What kind of role should it be?</p> <p>In a recent book about royal education, Peter Gordon and I began by looking at the changes over time in the role of the monarch - from the almost absolute power of the Tudors, to limitations placed on their absolutism by parliaments in the 17th century (when one king, Charles I, was executed and another, James II, was thrown out). We looked at further moves towards a constitutional monarchy in the 18th and 19th centuries and finally to the present situation, where monarchs have virtually no power but retain some of the symbols of power. For example, the Queen's speech and the ability to dissolve parliaments remain as misleading impressions of real power. Part of the training of modern monarchs has to be how to cope with such ambiguities: how to take ceremonial occasions seriously without being confused by the difference between appearance and reality. (That was one of the mistakes of the Queen's uncle, Edward VIII, and one of the reasons why he abdicated and was replaced by his more compliant brother.)</p> <p>The problem of preparing individuals for this strange role is complex. Yet little thought seems to have been given to the kind of education future kings or queens should have. The problem is that the monarchy as an institution inevitably conflicts with some of the principles of modern democracy, such as equality of opportunity. Our present Queen's education was left almost entirely to a young nanny - Crawfie - whose own education was extremely limited. The top priority for Elizabeth's parents was that she should have a happy childhood, and they interpreted this to mean no school, no university, nothing too demanding. When Crawfie later broke the rules and wrote a book about life with the royals, she said she was surprised that the King and Queen showed so little interest in their daughter's education.</p> <p>Although Elizabeth has, superficially, coped reasonably well with her constitutional position, it is said that she finds the company of academics and intellectuals difficult. Compared with many of her predecessors - Elizabeth I, for example - she has made little contribution to the artistic or intellectual life of her country. But Elizabeth I's education had been carefully planned according to Renaissance theories of education; she had been given the best tutors available, including Roger Ascham - not only a great scholar but an excellent teacher who wrote one of the best books of the 16th century about education, The Schoolmaster. Queen Elizabeth I surprised a group of foreign ambassadors by her ability to converse in French, Latin and Italian, and she had a real grasp of the theological, political and other issues of the day.</p> <p>A little more thought was given to the education of the present Prince of Wales. His education at Gordonstoun, inspired by the German educator Kurt Hahn, seems to have produced an individual who cares about society and the environment, but his lower-second Cambridge arts degree has left him confused, prejudiced against science and much too fond (for a future constitutional monarch) of putting forward personal views as facts rather than opinions. What kind of education was \"planned\" for William?</p> <p>At age three, William became a pupil at Mrs Mynor's private nursery school in west London. He stayed there until 1987 when he transferred to Wetherby School in Kensington, an exclusive pre-preparatory school. After three years he became a boarder at a preparatory school - Ludgrove School in Wokingham. His curricular and extracurricular activities were typical for boys going on to an elite independent school and university. In 1995, when he was 13, William passed his Common Entrance examination and proceeded to Eton, the most exclusive school in England.</p> <p>He followed the normal Eton curriculum and wore the distinctive Eton uniform designed to mark off the privileged pupils from the less privileged outsiders: black tailcoats, striped trousers, white ties. Having been taught in small classes compared with state schools, it was not surprising that William passed 12 subjects at GCSE; he went on to study geography, biology and history of art for A-levels. His university course has yet to be made public but it is likely to be history of art at a non-Oxbridge University, probably Edinburgh.</p> <p>The arrangements for \"preparing\" William for kingship also included the appointment of Tiggy Legge-Bourke: following the official separation of Charles and Diana in 1992, Legge-Bourke was appointed as a companion/nanny to William and Harry whenever they stayed with Charles. Her official position was assistant to the Prince of Wales's private secretary, but her duties were recreational and social - for example, helping to teach the boys to shoot rabbits. Clearly she was chosen for her social rather than intellectual accomplishments, since her academic qualifications consisted of four passes at O-level and a Montessori teaching certificate, which would not have qualified her for employment in a state school.</p> <p>There are three reasons for suggesting that William's education has not been an adequate preparation for a future king. First, Eton, although a \"good school\" in some respects, is an unsuitable environment for a future king. At a time when the monarchy needs to become more \"democratic\", William has been brought up in a privileged institution, where he was socialised into thinking of himself as a superior person. At Eton he also became identified with such upper-class pursuits as beagling (hunting hares with dogs) and other blood sports, which many find offensive. He has mixed throughout his schooling with a limited section of the population. His education and training should have broadened his social experience, but have restricted it instead.</p> <p>Second, the choice of history of art at university will not be adequate unless supplemented by courses that will give him a thorough understanding of the British constitution and his future position within it. A constitutional monarch has to learn that it is not possible to accept all the privileges of the role while ignoring its responsibilities and limitations; a special kind of moral education is needed. And does he know enough about national finances and how the parliamentary system works? Does he understand the Commonwealth, the European Union, the United Nations and other international organisations?</p> <p>Finally, William needed to learn not to abuse his privileged position to foist his views on the rest of the population. The country needs someone who will demonstrate that he can have a useful but limited role in a modern democratic society. One of the dangers of being \"prepared\" for monarchy is that the deference paid to royalty, plus the privileged lifestyle, may actually encourage royals to believe that they are superior. That is not the kind of king the country wants or needs.</p> <p>The advantage of having a monarch rather than a presidential system is that it places the position of head of state outside politics. Some would add that a royal head of state preserves valuable historical traditions and serves to unify a kingdom by reinforcing our national heritage. That is a more controversial view, not least because it involves contradictions and tensions between the traditional role of monarch and the modern principles of democracy. Part of the education and training of a future king must be to encourage the dignified performance of the role of head of state while constantly reminding the role-player that he is a normal human being in no way superior as a person to any of his subjects. This is a difficult lesson to learn: Edward VIII never grasped the distinction and some suggest that Prince Charles has occasionally been guilty of the same delusion.</p> <p>In our book, Peter Gordon and I pointed out that in recent years the position of private secretary to a monarch or future monarch has been important in providing educative advice on the role of a constitutional king or queen. Several constitutional disasters have been avoided by taking good advice. We suggested that this kind of advisory role could be extended for Prince William and combined with an explicitly educative one with the appointment of a private secretary who would act also as a kind of moral tutor. Such a position would have to be filled carefully. But without some such arrangement the future of the monarchy might be in doubt. It may already be too late.</p> <p>Although among the population as a whole there may be royalist support of a kind, among young people - the decision-makers of the future - the picture is less comforting for those who wish to preserve the status quo. Only a few days ago it was reported that Barry Hale, an 18-year-old comprehensive school pupil from Liverpool, had written an open letter to \"Dear William\" condemning the monarchy as an outdated institution that should be abolished. The letter was the basis of a BBC TV programme which was to be shown to coincide with the Prince's 18th birthday. The BBC has now scrapped the plan, though it may be shown \"later\".<br><br>Denis Lawton is professor of education at the Institute of Education, University of London, and author, with Professor Peter Gordon, of Royal Education: Past, Present and Future (published by Frank Cass).</p>",

But then, royal marriages have been based on less. </p> <p><b>Britney Spears</b></p> <p> <b> Age: </b> 18. </p> <p><b> Pedigree: </b> The daughter of devout baptists Jamie and Lynne, a building contractor and teacher from the nondescript Louisiana trucking town of Kentwood. </p> <p><b> Assets: </b> Like many a teenage boy, Wills is rumoured to have walls plastered with Britney pin-ups.And there have been claims that he's actually exchanged emails and gifts with the child-woman. </p> <p><b> Liabilities:</b> A hectic touring schedule probably wouldn't be compatible with ribbon-cutting duties. </p> <p><b> Prospects:</b> According to reports, Britney recently purchased Battledown Manor, a quick chauffeur-assisted ride from Highgrove.

The only aristocrats ever to have longer names than this died of exhaustion signing credit-card receipts. </p> <p><b> Liabilities:</b> Breathless revelations in the Sunday Express that the It-girl of Edinburgh University and the young prince had formed \"a close bond\" were slightly undermined by a press complaints commission ruling which noted that they had, in fact, never met. </p> <p><b> Prospects: </b> Better than you might think. Perhaps actually meeting is where most recent royal couplings have gone wrong. </p> <p><b>Princess Theodora of Greece</b></p> <p> <b> Age:</b> 17. </p> <p><b> Pedigree:</b> Fourth child of King Constantine and his wife Queen Anne Marie. </p> <p><b> Assets:</b> Greek, which will be a big help with the grandparents.

      "bodyText": "Victoria Aitken Age: 19. Pedigree: Daughter of perjury enthusiast Jonathan and his ex-wife Lolicia. Assets: Friends of the family, in a way: Victoria's dad has already spent some months as a guest of William's grandmother. Liabilities: One photograph at one party showing the two within a two-metre radius of each other is not, it has to be said, the basis for the kind of marriage of which the average Relate counsellor would approve. Wills had never met her before and probably hasn't since. Prospects: They've only ever met for a few minutes. But then, royal marriages have been based on less. Britney Spears Age: 18. Pedigree: The daughter of devout baptists Jamie and Lynne, a building contractor and teacher from the nondescript Louisiana trucking town of Kentwood. Assets: Like many a teenage boy, Wills is rumoured to have walls plastered with Britney pin-ups.And there have been claims that he's actually exchanged emails and gifts with the child-woman. Liabilities: A hectic touring schedule probably wouldn't be compatible with ribbon-cutting duties. Prospects: According to reports, Britney recently purchased Battledown Manor, a quick chauffeur-assisted ride from Highgrove. This looks promising - unless it signifies that, in true royal style, she aims to move out of Wills's house and into her own within weeks of the wedding. Isabella Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe Age: 20. Pedigree: Granddaughter of pre-war racing star Earl Curzon and daughter of 1960s debutante Mary-Gaye. Assets: Three barrels, which must count for something. The only aristocrats ever to have longer names than this died of exhaustion signing credit-card receipts. Liabilities: Breathless revelations in the Sunday Express that the It-girl of Edinburgh University and the young prince had formed \"a close bond\" were slightly undermined by a press complaints commission ruling which noted that they had, in fact, never met. Prospects: Better than you might think. Perhaps actually meeting is where most recent royal couplings have gone wrong. Princess Theodora of Greece Age: 17. Pedigree: Fourth child of King Constantine and his wife Queen Anne Marie. Assets: Greek, which will be a big help with the grandparents. And royal. Liabilities: There's the small awkwardness that Theodora's parents currently reside in Hampstead Garden Suburb, because the Greek royal family is in exile. Prospects: Diplomatically tricky. Davina Duckworth-Chad Age: 21. Pedigree: Her mother Elizabeth is Diana's first cousin, so she and the prince are related. Her father, Anthony, is a Norfolk landowner. Assets: Brains, breeding and looks are all on her side. Plus, she showed up with Wills and others on the April 1999 cruise on board John Latsis's \"love boat\". Liabilities: Davina's famous appearance dressed in rubber on Country Life's website won her the soubriquet \"Deb on the web\" - amusing now; pretty embarrassing when you're queen. Zara Simmons Age: 19. Pedigree: Top aristo credentials. Zara is the granddaughter of Countess Hermione Ranfurly. Assets: When she was 14 and he 12, he wrote her love letters and sent her chocolates, and they had a sweet holiday romance as guests of friends in Greece. Only . . . Liabilities: . . . she dumped him. Prospects: She reportedly kissed him at a 1996 party. And if that isn't watertight evidence of impending nuptials, we'd like to know what is. Laura Spence Age: 18. Educated: Monkseaton communiuty high school, Whitley Bay, and, soon, Harvard University. Assets: \"Monkey High\" is an unlikely breeding-ground for royal escorts, but now she's been snapped up by those assiduous snapper-uppers at Harvard's Snapping-Up Department, Spence will exude Ivy League allure. Liabilities: For someone whose name has become synonymous with a crusade against elitism, marrying the next king isn't a wholly obvious next move. Prospects: Slim. Even the persuasive powers of Monkseaton head Paul Kelley won't stretch to bringing about a royal wedding. Sarah Gore Age: 21. Pedigree: One of four children of Al Gore - presidential hopeful and self-styled inventor of the internet - and his curiously named wife Tipper. Assets: The fathers of the bride and groom, Prince Charles and putative president Al, are equally environmentally minded and would get on like fossil fuels on fire. Liabilities: The Gores - Tennessee democrats - and the Windsors - home counties aristocrats - might not see eye to eye on other political questions. Prospects: It might work - but for a real Special Relationship, Sarah, currently a college senior, would be better off waiting for one of the Blair boys to reach adulthood. Laura Fellowes Age: 19. Pedigree: A cousin of Wills's, Laura is also the daughter of Sir Robert Fellowes, the Queen's former private secretary. Assets: As a cousin, Fellowes might provide a whiff of that arguably inadvisable genetic proximity that has made the members of our royal family - and those strange mountain people in the film Deliverance - what they are. Liabilities: On second thoughts, maybe that's not such a good idea. Prospects: Stranger things have happened. And quite a few of them have happened to members of the British royal family. Holly Branson Age: 18. Pedigree: Daughter of Richard and his second wife Joan. Assets: A sizeable inheritance. Sufficient beauty to have already been a Cosmo model. And a declared ideal man who is \"about 6ft 2in, dark, with blue eyes and a chunky build,\" on which Wills scores two out of four. Liabilities: New money. A mindbogglingly large amount - but new money, none the less. Prospects: A Virgin Queen might be a rebranding too far for Britain's least self-made family. And things wouldn't bode well for the punctuality of the royal train. Stephen Gately Age: 24. Pedigree: Son of cleaning lady Margaret and her husband Martin, Gately's childhood on Dublin's rock-hard Sheriff Street was a world away from Wills's. Assets: A Gately-Windsor union would modernise the monarchy at a stroke, doing away with the need for all those troublesome committees and Highgrove handwringing. Liabilities: Gately's longstanding boyfriend Eloy de Jong, a Dutch musician, is extremely big. Prospects: Too little in common. The coming-out endured by Gateley was, after all, a little more nerve-wracking than those of William's debutante chums.",

We followed the law to prevent others committing war crimes. Attempts to say Nato's action as a whole was illegal were rejected by the UN security council at the time. Claims that individual actions were war crimes have been rejected recently by Carla del Ponte, the chief prosecutor of the UN's International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia, who said of Nato's actions: \"I am very satisfied there was no deliberate targeting of civilians or unlawful military targets by Nato during the bombing campaign\".</p> <p>Nato was right to act last year and did so while working within the confines of the laws of war.

She said, referring to the legitimacy of Nato's action in Kosovo, \"you could take the robust view that a war crime committed by men with pure hearts and high moral purpose (ie our side) is not a war crime. George Robertson, indeed, has come perilously close to such a position.\" I most certainly have not. My view has always been that Nato had sufficient legal basis to act in Kosovo. We followed the law to prevent others committing war crimes. Attempts to say Nato's action as a whole was illegal were rejected by the UN security council at the time. Claims that individual actions were war crimes have been rejected recently by Carla del Ponte, the chief prosecutor of the UN's International Criminal Tribunal for Yugoslavia, who said of Nato's actions: \"I am very satisfied there was no deliberate targeting of civilians or unlawful military targets by Nato during the bombing campaign\". Nato was right to act last year and did so while working within the confines of the laws of war. Our action was moral and lawful. No one doubts our action was controversial and Isabel Hilton is entitled to her views, but not to distort mine. Lord Robertson Secretary general, Nato \u0095 Congratulations to Isabel Hilton for exposing the illegality and immorality of Nato aggression in Kosovo. Tony Blair should call a halt to our participation in warlike acts carried out without the authority of the UN, as in Kosovo, Iraq and Sierra Leone. George Robertson's call last week for the re-arming of Nato should be rejected as it presages further interventions which are antagonistic to the search for world peace. D Sheldon Epsom",

What we will have, as John Maynard Smith (one of the world's greatest evolutionary biologists) said recently, will be \"like wanting to learn Hungarian and being given lists of all the Hungarian words but without any of them defined\". Not only will we not have a clue as to what any of First Assembly means, but neither will the scientists. </p> <p>And that is just one of the many reasons why the human genome discoveries make people nervous - the sense that we are launching into a huge unknown territory which makes all we have so far discovered look puny in comparison. As geneticist Norton Zinder comments in this week's lead article in the New Yorker, The Genome Wars, \"This is the beginning of the beginning.\" There's nothing more frightening than being in Year Zero. </p> <p>Here we are facing a scientific breakthrough like Newton's laws of gravity or Darwin's theory of evolution, and the predominant emotion is fear.

Craig Venter, who runs the private company, Celera, scares a lot of people. His methods of distributing the information his company discovers only to subscribers who in turn spew out applications for patents on genes, raises the prospect of this new territory being parcelled out to US pharmaceutical companies before anyone else has even got a map. What's more, the brave new world of genetic research could be stillborn, bogged into a quagmire of patent law in which the only beneficiaries will be teams of US corporate lawyers. </p> <p>To old-fashioned public-spirited scientists, it is deeply repulsive that some thing as important as the human genome has become the plaything of a flamboyant entrepreneur who wants to use it to become the world's first bio-tech billionaire.

The result is a stream of abuse between Venter and the scientists in the international Human Genome Project - the British end of which is being carried out in the Sanger Centre, Cambridge. As a scientist concludes in the New Yorker: \"It happens to be the most important project in science of our time, and it has all the character of a schoolyard brawl.\" </p> <p>Perhaps all such scientific discoveries are marked by territorialism, money-making ambitions and squabbles, but these are writ-large in billions of dollars and they coincide with a period of growing distrust of scientists and what happens to their discoveries. Genetic modification may or may not have great advantages for human beings and the environment, but what the past few years has undoubtedly shown is how pernicious the discovery is in the hands of an unscrupulous corporation intent on maximum commercialisation. The point is that our capacity at an institutional and governmental level to regulate the exploitation of scientific discovery seems to be woefully inadequate. </p> <p> Part of this lies in the globalisation of scientific research. The British government can do little to stop GM developments in the US and, as we have painfully discovered over the GM contaminated rape seed case, we can't isolate ourselves from it either.

Our generation will face huge moral dilemmas - what's wrong with cloning? What genetic disorders do we weed out? What kind of eugenics is acceptable? - and we are without any of the old moral compasses. There is a paradox here, about the huge power we have developed - the computer revealed last week with a capacity millions times that of a PC - and a sense of impotence over knowing how or what to control of our discoveries. </p> <p>Beyond all these understandable, rational reasons for anxiety over the human genome project, lies an instinctive fear. We don't much like the idea that in 15 or so years, all the biological make-up of our bodies could be carried on a smart card: will we be reduced to a computer print-out. It's a shock to human psychology as far-reaching as Galileo's blow to the medieval mind when he put the sun not the earth at the centre of the universe, or when Darwin told us we were descended from apes.

      "body": "<p>Columnists are a staple of print journalism, and you probably have your favourites. But in most newspapers and magazines, columnists write for the broad audience and keep the subject matter within the bounds of mass appeal. With the exception of those writing for \"edgy\" print publications, most print columnists must play it safe and write to please a diverse group of readers. </p> <p>It's different on the internet, where experimentation about what defines a \"column\" is constantly being extended. It's possible on the internet to write for a narrow audience - so narrow that traditional print publications won't touch such writers' work. Even a transmogrified cockroach can find work with a reputable online publisher and build an audience. Your favorite columnist online may, indeed, be a different animal. </p> <p>Recently, I judged entries in the online category of the annual contest of the (American) National Society of Newspaper Columnists. (Entrants write for newspaper websites, not for the print editions.) \"bernie\" the cockroach was one of the entrants. Writing all in lower case - a cockroach wouldn't be able to hit the shift key and a letter simultaneously after all - bernie writes his weekly column in staccato verse about topics of the day for eXaminer.com, the website of the San Francisco Examiner. </p> <p>bernie's readers are not told his columns are actually written by Virginia-based Mary Ann Hogan, a writing coach and story consultant. bernie is a new media descendant of \"archy\" the cockroach, who wrote a column for the New York Sun in 1916. It's indicative of the state of US newspapers today that cockroach musings are too far out for print publications, but fit right in at websites more willing to be colourful. </p> <p>eXaminer.com, home to bernie, is one of those newspaper sites that believes in having lots of original (as opposed to just re-purposed from print) writing. Another fascinating online columnist on the site is the Night Cabbie, a real-life taxi driver who writes about his experiences with interesting customers. </p> <p>While bernie and Night Cabbie are not newspaper employees, some print journalists are using the web as a more open and creative outlet. For example, Fort Worth (Texas) Star-Telegram humour columnist Dave Lieber and his alter ego, JR Lieber (\"the Yankee cowboy everybody loves to hate\"), use the web for columns that won't work in print. He also uses the web to experiment with video columns - campy, self-made productions that have the feel of home movies. Those are produced in his own time, but the videos give Lieber an outlet for pushing \"column\" writing to places other than on dead trees. </p> <p>Quite a few columnists write online while working for traditional news media companies. Rob Neyer writes an inside baseball column for ESPN.com, the website of the sports TV network. The column is written in \"weblog\" format, with today's items added on top of previous days' - often building on what went before. </p> <p>At Canada's CBC News website too, online columns are taken seriously. Among the columnists is Martin O'Malley, one of Canada's most renowned print journalists and book authors who, late in his career, made the move to new media writing. CBC Online also publishes columns by a non-journalist, Saskatchewan farmer Jocelyn Hainsworth, who writes compelling accounts of life on the farm. </p> <p>Hainsworth and Night Cabbie are typical of the non-journalists who attempt to make names for themselves as online columnists. Frankly, some of their work makes for better reading than the career writers'. Some websites, like the Star-Telegram's, even solicit online columnists in the hope of building new stars. The S-T invites anyone to apply to be a volunteer \"cyber-columnist\". Current citizen columns include aviation tales, tips on woodcrafting and Fort Worth police department news.

      "bodyText": "Columnists are a staple of print journalism, and you probably have your favourites. But in most newspapers and magazines, columnists write for the broad audience and keep the subject matter within the bounds of mass appeal. With the exception of those writing for \"edgy\" print publications, most print columnists must play it safe and write to please a diverse group of readers. It's different on the internet, where experimentation about what defines a \"column\" is constantly being extended. It's possible on the internet to write for a narrow audience - so narrow that traditional print publications won't touch such writers' work. Even a transmogrified cockroach can find work with a reputable online publisher and build an audience. Your favorite columnist online may, indeed, be a different animal. Recently, I judged entries in the online category of the annual contest of the (American) National Society of Newspaper Columnists. (Entrants write for newspaper websites, not for the print editions.) \"bernie\" the cockroach was one of the entrants. Writing all in lower case - a cockroach wouldn't be able to hit the shift key and a letter simultaneously after all - bernie writes his weekly column in staccato verse about topics of the day for eXaminer.com, the website of the San Francisco Examiner. bernie's readers are not told his columns are actually written by Virginia-based Mary Ann Hogan, a writing coach and story consultant. bernie is a new media descendant of \"archy\" the cockroach, who wrote a column for the New York Sun in 1916. It's indicative of the state of US newspapers today that cockroach musings are too far out for print publications, but fit right in at websites more willing to be colourful. eXaminer.com, home to bernie, is one of those newspaper sites that believes in having lots of original (as opposed to just re-purposed from print) writing. Another fascinating online columnist on the site is the Night Cabbie, a real-life taxi driver who writes about his experiences with interesting customers. While bernie and Night Cabbie are not newspaper employees, some print journalists are using the web as a more open and creative outlet. For example, Fort Worth (Texas) Star-Telegram humour columnist Dave Lieber and his alter ego, JR Lieber (\"the Yankee cowboy everybody loves to hate\"), use the web for columns that won't work in print. He also uses the web to experiment with video columns - campy, self-made productions that have the feel of home movies. Those are produced in his own time, but the videos give Lieber an outlet for pushing \"column\" writing to places other than on dead trees. Quite a few columnists write online while working for traditional news media companies. Rob Neyer writes an inside baseball column for ESPN.com, the website of the sports TV network. The column is written in \"weblog\" format, with today's items added on top of previous days' - often building on what went before. At Canada's CBC News website too, online columns are taken seriously. Among the columnists is Martin O'Malley, one of Canada's most renowned print journalists and book authors who, late in his career, made the move to new media writing. CBC Online also publishes columns by a non-journalist, Saskatchewan farmer Jocelyn Hainsworth, who writes compelling accounts of life on the farm. Hainsworth and Night Cabbie are typical of the non-journalists who attempt to make names for themselves as online columnists. Frankly, some of their work makes for better reading than the career writers'. Some websites, like the Star-Telegram's, even solicit online columnists in the hope of building new stars. The S-T invites anyone to apply to be a volunteer \"cyber-columnist\". Current citizen columns include aviation tales, tips on woodcrafting and Fort Worth police department news. Only those who get the S-T editors' seal of approval get published. The examples above are a tiny smattering of what's available in the way of online columns. The central point is that columns on the internet can be very different from old-fashioned newspaper columns\". While there's plenty of conventional column writing on the web, there's some amazing writing available that is at home only in new media. If newspaper and magazine columnists leave you cold, look to the internet for variety, creativity, zaniness... and increasingly, quality column writing. \u0095 bernie the cockroach: www.examiner.com/bernie \u0095 CBC Online columnists: www.cbc.ca/news/viewpoint/ \u0095 Fort Worth Star-Telegram CyberColumnists: www.star-telegram.com/comm/reference/cybercol/howto.htm \u0095 Night Cabbie: www.examiner.com/cabbie www.examiner.com/cabbie \u0095 Rob Neyer column: http://espn.go.com/mlb/columns/neyer_rob/\" \u0095 Steve Outing is a Colorado-based columnist and analyst who covers internet media trends.

APB, Salon and their siblings had been the darlings of the stock market during the previous spring, but the Nasdaq crash in April had so reduced their market values (Salon's stock price has slid from a high of $15 to around $2 per share) that the traditional way of raising more money for an unprofitable company - selling more stock to the public at a wildly overvalued price - was suddenly ruled out.

Todd Hagen, who had arrived at Salon from the security industry, decided to return there as CEO of security e-tailer AlarmX.com. A search for his replacement is under way. Just five days later, on May 24, Salon announced its earnings. The company brought in $2.6m for the quarter, less than the $3m it had predicted in January, but in line with the estimate issued in its warning. The next day, investment bank WR Ham brecht, which had taken Salon public in 1999 with solid but unspectacular results - many blamed its relatively un-tested Dutch-auction \"Open IPO\" system - announced it was lowering its revenue estimates for Salon's 2001 fiscal year. It predicted the company would only earn $14.3m in the next 12 months, nearly a 30% drop from its original estimate of $20.5m. </p> <p>Hambrecht analyst Bill Lennan outlined his concerns to Inside.com at the time: \"The revenue shortfall was pretty dramatic.

Total ad impressions (the number of ads on each page multiplied by the number of pages) were up 27% to a new company high of 483m for the quarter. With Salon's market capitalisation currently hovering just under $30m, raising a large amount of cash via selling stock is impossible at the moment without giving the company away.

Achieving profitability is the only way out for Salon until its stock price improves significantly, which certainly won't be soon and conceivably could be never. </p> <p>Which is why it's conserving the $14m or so it has remaining in the bank by trimming what it perceives to be dead wood from its table of contents.

I was, by chance, offered a disturbing reminder of this the other day at a private showing of a television documentary that remains on the blocked list. It is unshown and unknown to the wider world, perhaps even censored by some hidden hand. Until my chance invitation, it was simply not discussed, even by the chattering classes.</p> <p>Let me explain. In 1947 the Labour government of Clement Attlee approved the bringing to Britain of the remains of an entire division of the Nazi Waffen SS, numbering some 8,000 men. The 14th SS Division, called the Galizien (Galicia), consisted entirely of Ukrainians, mostly from Polish Ukraine which had been taken over by the Soviets after the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact of August 1939.</p> <p>The Ukrainian SS men's arrival was largely unpublicised at the time and they were distributed around the country in temporary camps to await resettlement. Fifteen hundred of them are still living in Britain today, their history and background cloaked in mystery. Deep suspicions remain, however, about their role as an important part of Hitler's war machine on the eastern front.</p> <p>The unused (suppressed?), hour-long documentary was produced by Julian Hendy, a talented television writer and historian. It was scheduled to be shown on Yorkshire TV last year but was pulled at short notice with a promise that it would be shown this year. Since then there has been silence. The BBC became involved in discussions about Hendy's film at one point - but backed off.</p> <p>The film is a stunning documentary about a phase of the second world war that has yet to be explained. Hendy shows the Galizien SS Division involved in horrendous war crimes in Ukraine and Slovakia.

      "bodyText": "Scarcely a day passes without an example of how the absence of a mature Freedom of Information Act denies our so-called free society knowledge we are entitled to have. Under our current system the political deceptions and lies of history remain undetected and undisclosed. I was, by chance, offered a disturbing reminder of this the other day at a private showing of a television documentary that remains on the blocked list. It is unshown and unknown to the wider world, perhaps even censored by some hidden hand. Until my chance invitation, it was simply not discussed, even by the chattering classes. Let me explain. In 1947 the Labour government of Clement Attlee approved the bringing to Britain of the remains of an entire division of the Nazi Waffen SS, numbering some 8,000 men. The 14th SS Division, called the Galizien (Galicia), consisted entirely of Ukrainians, mostly from Polish Ukraine which had been taken over by the Soviets after the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact of August 1939. The Ukrainian SS men's arrival was largely unpublicised at the time and they were distributed around the country in temporary camps to await resettlement. Fifteen hundred of them are still living in Britain today, their history and background cloaked in mystery. Deep suspicions remain, however, about their role as an important part of Hitler's war machine on the eastern front. The unused (suppressed?), hour-long documentary was produced by Julian Hendy, a talented television writer and historian. It was scheduled to be shown on Yorkshire TV last year but was pulled at short notice with a promise that it would be shown this year. Since then there has been silence. The BBC became involved in discussions about Hendy's film at one point - but backed off. The film is a stunning documentary about a phase of the second world war that has yet to be explained. Hendy shows the Galizien SS Division involved in horrendous war crimes in Ukraine and Slovakia. He provides eyewitness accounts and documentation of the murder by shooting, fire-bombing, hanging, mutilation and appalling torture of anyone who stood out in resistance to the Nazis - be they Poles, Russians, Ukrainians, Slovaks, Jews and non-Jews, partisan fighters or people just going about village life. Whole villages were destroyed by fire bomb ing; bodies were thrown into mass graves. The grim story is familiar enough to those of us who know what happened on that war front - but here is fresh evidence of something which has a new and sinister connotation, namely the British connection. At the end of the war the remnants of the 14th SS Division slipped away from the Soviet occupying army into Austria to be made prisoners under the British (a better option than the Soviets). They were encamped firstly in Austria and later in Italy for interrogation - most of which was done casually and without expert interpreters to check details. The British Foreign Office asked the distinguished war hero Brigadier Sir Fitzroy Maclean to cast his expert eye over the Ukrainians. He did so but found the task extremely difficult without suitable back-up resources. His report to London appears to have cleared the Ukrainians for entry into Britain - though what Fitzroy Maclean actually reported back to London is still far from clear. At any rate the former Waffen SS men were shipped to Britain in 1947, with their Iron Crosses in their pockets and Heinrich Himmler's praises still resting, privately, in their memories (they were honoured personally by Himmler after one of their more brutal escapades in Slovakia). Not long after their arrival in Britain, once most of them had been absorbed into British life, a number of the former SS men were alleged to have been recruited by British Military Intelligence.

On radio, this was a spot-on spoof of File On Four, a very specific joke with limited appeal beyond the context in which it first appeared. And so it proved. </p> <p>Chambers, however - and perhaps against the odds - is a success, sitting comfortably in the tradition of Yes, Minister and Porridge. Chambers belongs to that highly unfashionable genre, namely the class-ridden institutional sitcom. </p> <p>John Bird plays the mainstay of the partnership, and he is fantastic in the part: vain, lazy, self-important and thoroughly human. He'd love to fight your case, but he'd rather read a good Jilly Cooper. </p> <p>In one of the stranger radio episodes, Bird finds himself stuck in the countryside, unable to cross a field until he pays the farmer. Bird offers professional advice by way of recompense. \"Maybe you should sue, maybe you shouldn't - that's my advice.\" In episode one of the TV series, Bird explains to a na\u00efve new partner that \"the fee structure is complex. It's two grand a file\". \"But some of the files are empty,\" says the new partner. \"That's what makes it complex,\" says Bird. </p> <p>In this era of Coupling, Cold Feet and too numerous cool, loft-dwelling variations on Friends, it's a pleasure to see the return of old-fashioned, ie funny, situation comedy. </p> <p>One of the stranger elements of Chambers is Bird's assistant, a mockney geezer called Vince, straight from the Ealing era of working class deferentialism. In the great tradition of institutional sitcom, Vince is the only one who really knows what's going on, but never lets on. It's totally anachronistic, possibly insulting, and - guess what? - it's believable as well. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Chambers (Thursday, BBC1) began life on Radio 4, and so the dilemma for writer Clive Coleman has been to turn a highly witty, occasionally surreal portrait of barrister life into a homogenised BBC1 sitcom, complete with HAHAHA laughter-track. The pitfalls of the transfer from radio to TV were recently illustrated by the failure of People Like Us. On radio, this was a spot-on spoof of File On Four, a very specific joke with limited appeal beyond the context in which it first appeared. And so it proved. Chambers, however - and perhaps against the odds - is a success, sitting comfortably in the tradition of Yes, Minister and Porridge. Chambers belongs to that highly unfashionable genre, namely the class-ridden institutional sitcom. John Bird plays the mainstay of the partnership, and he is fantastic in the part: vain, lazy, self-important and thoroughly human. He'd love to fight your case, but he'd rather read a good Jilly Cooper. In one of the stranger radio episodes, Bird finds himself stuck in the countryside, unable to cross a field until he pays the farmer. Bird offers professional advice by way of recompense. \"Maybe you should sue, maybe you shouldn't - that's my advice.\" In episode one of the TV series, Bird explains to a na\u00efve new partner that \"the fee structure is complex. It's two grand a file\". \"But some of the files are empty,\" says the new partner. \"That's what makes it complex,\" says Bird. In this era of Coupling, Cold Feet and too numerous cool, loft-dwelling variations on Friends, it's a pleasure to see the return of old-fashioned, ie funny, situation comedy. One of the stranger elements of Chambers is Bird's assistant, a mockney geezer called Vince, straight from the Ealing era of working class deferentialism. In the great tradition of institutional sitcom, Vince is the only one who really knows what's going on, but never lets on. It's totally anachronistic, possibly insulting, and - guess what? - it's believable as well.",

      "body": "<p>President Hafez al-Assad, master of Syria since 1979, was a towering figure of Arab politics, respected and feared in his own country and throughout the Middle East. His death, at the age of 69, marks the end of an era in the region.</p> <p>His achievements were threefold: he gave Syria years of much-needed, if somewhat repressive, stability; he turned his relatively small country, once the victim of other people's intrigues, into a major regional player whose views could no longer be ignored; and, with patience and dogged consistency, he fought to prevent Israel from imposing its will on the Arab world.</p> <p>In the end, he came to terms with the fact of Israel's existence, and was persuaded to open negotiations for a permanent peace settlement. But his dream of containing the Jewish state within its pre-1967 borders, and of checking the spread of its regional influence by means of an Arab-Israeli balance of power, was not realised. To that extent, he died a disappointed man.</p> <p>Assad's long rule was all the more remarkable in that he was not born a Sunni Muslim, the sect that has for centuries been the dominant orthodox mainstream of Islam, and from which Syria's rulers have traditionally been drawn. His family were Alawites, a heterodox outgrowth of Shi'ism, itself something of an opposition in Islam for the past 1,000 years.</p> <p>In Syria, the Alawites were a small, down-trodden community, which, to escape persecution, had taken refuge in the mountains of the north-west. It was there, in Qurdaha - then a squalid village, but now greatly expanded and beautified as befits the leader's birthplace - that Assad was born.</p> <p>His inheritance was bitter. To be born an Alawite in a country where sect and family count for much was to suffer from a built-in minority complex - which, to his credit, he always strove to surmount. To be born a poor country boy meant that he grew up resenting the privileged and arrogant land-owning families that made up Syria's ruling class - before they were routed by Assad's own Baathist revolution.</p> <p>Politics was his life-long interest. As a schoolboy, he joined the pan-Arab socialist Baath party, and rose to be a student leader. He wanted to become a doctor, but his parents could not pay the fees, so he went to the military academy. He volunteered for the air force and passed out top of his class. He was sent on flying courses to the Soviet Union and to Egypt, and it was in Cairo, with an admiring eye on Gamal Abdul Nasser, the great Arab leader of his day, that he became a conspirator, plotting with a small group of fellow officers, like himself from minority backgrounds, to overthrow the Syrian government, a task accomplished in 1963.</p> <p>In the next seven years, Assad clawed his way up the ladder until he emerged as sole leader in 1970 - a position he retained through wars, diplomatic crises, internal and external challenges and unrelenting stress. His revolution turned Syria's social and political structures upside down. The country boys triumphed, and none more so than the Alawites who, although no more than 12% of the population, came to occupy plum positions in every sector of life.</p> <p>Externally, the main landmarks of Assad's life had to do with the struggle against Israel. As a young and inexperienced defence minister in the 1967 war, he presided over the loss of the Golan Heights. In 1970, he sent tanks into Jordan to help the Palestinians against King Hussein, but had to beat a humiliating retreat when Israel threatened to intervene. In 1973, he secretly planned the October war with Egypt's Anwar al- Sadat, but Israel turned the tables on them both, and by defeating Egypt took it out of the Arab military equation.</p> <p>When the hardline Menachem Begin came to power in Israel in 1977, Assad faced a militant Likud determined to create a \"greater Israel\". To absorb the occupied territories of the West Bank and Gaza free from Arab challenge, Begin and his rugged defence minister, Ariel Sharon, conceived the daring plan of bringing Lebanon into Israel's orbit. In 1982, they invaded Lebanon and besieged Beirut, with the aim of booting out both the PLO and the Syrians, and installing a Maronite vassal ready to do their bidding.</p> <p>Israel's brutal gambit posed a deadly threat to Assad. A Lebanon under Israeli control would have reduced Syria to insignificance. Rallying his allies, he fought back. Israel's troops were harried by guerrillas and took heavy casualties. Israel's adventure turned into a debacle and a dispirited Begin gave up the struggle. The US-brokered Israel-Lebanon treaty, which was to have consecrated Israel's influence over its neighbour, was torn up. From Syria's point of view, it was Assad's finest hour.</p> <p>Throughout all these battles, he had an ally of sorts in the Soviet Union. Their longstanding relationship was founded on Soviet arms transfers, economic aid for Syria's major infrastructural projects, and political support in the common cause of reducing western and Israeli infuence.</p> <p>However, the Arab defeat in the six-day war caused strains in the relationship. After 1967 - and again after 1973 - it became obvious that, while the Soviets were prepared to re-arm their Arab prot\u00e9g\u00e9s, they were reluctant to give them the means to recover their lost territories by force, still less to defeat Israel in all-out war. Moscow was anxious to avoid a confrontation with the United States.</p> <p>These hesitations - which contrasted with Washington's full-blooded support for Israel - infected Arab relations with Moscow, and it was at least partly for this reason that Assad never entered fully into the Soviet orbit. He insisted on retaining a large measure of freedom; he wanted arms and credit, but also autonomy. As a result, there were limits to what he could expect from Moscow - but it also meant that once the Soviet empire collapsed, he was not swept away like other leaders, in Eastern Europe and elsewhere, who had been more closely bound to Moscow.</p> <p>When Gorbachev emerged, anxious to befriend the west, Assad was quick to grasp that a major prop of his world was gone. With great pragmatism, he corrected his aim and, by 1987, was busy making overtures to Washington. There is little doubt, however, that the end of the cold war - and the loss of Soviet support - were serious blows to his strategy of holding Israel in check.</p> <p>The late 1980s and early 1990s were not easy years for Assad since they brought profound and, as seen from Damascus, unwelcome changes to the international and regional environment. The destruction of Iraq in the Gulf war further weakened Syria's strategic position.</p> <p>When Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait on August 2 1990, Assad recognised at once that Iraq's aggression was a serious threat to Syria's interests - as it was to those of every other major player in the region. All realised that the combination of Iraq and Kuwait would dominate the whole Middle East system. Assad had long detested Saddam, a sentiment that was fully reciprocated. He sensed that if Saddam got away with his seizure of Kuwait, Syria would be his next target.</p> <p>So Assad joined the American-led coalition and sent troops to help defend Saudi Arabia. But he did not welcome the Gulf war. As an Arab patriot, he deplored the destruction of Iraq, the depletion of Arab financial assets, the ever-greater influence of the US in the region, and the corresponding loss of Arab independence. Moreover, the Gulf war robbed the Arabs of any residual ability to challenge the Israel military. Israel's position became unassailable; it dominated the region.</p> <p>Such was the impetus for the new phase of Middle East peace-making launched, under American auspices, in Madrid in October 1991. Assad accepted President Bush's invitation to take part in bilateral talks with Israel, but it was not what he had hoped for.</p> <p>He had long argued that peace with Israel was not worth having unless it was comprehensive, involving an Israeli retreat on all fronts. He was opposed to separate deals, which he felt divided the Arab camp. So it was with great hesitation that he fell in with the Madrid formula of separate tracks, which was to Israel's advantage.</p> <p>Assad was soon to suffer further setbacks. In September 1993, Israel reached a secret accord with Yasser Arafat's PLO, which put an end to the intifada in the occupied territories - without giving the Palestinians any substantial gains. Assad denounced the agreement, but declared he would not to fight it. A year later, a further blow fell when, in October 1994 and to Assad's dismay, Jordan concluded a peace treaty with Israel.</p> <p>These agreements effectively brought the Palestinians and Jordan into Israel's sphere of influence - a development which Assad had struggled for years to prevent. With American encouragement, other Arab states - Morocco, Tunisia, Oman and Qatar among them - then developed ties of differing degrees of warmth and formality with Israel, further contributing to Assad's discomfiture. On January 21 1994, his eldest son, Basil, was killed in a car accident, adding a personal tragedy to his political problems.</p> <p>Assad sought to strengthen his regional position by tightening his grip on Lebanon, by fostering his strategic relationship with Iran, and by keeping alive his Gulf war alliance with Saudi Arabia and Egypt. He was anxious, too, to keep open his lines to Washington, whose predom-inant role in the peace process he could not dispute.</p> <p>But to Assad's great disappointment, the Clinton administration was to prove one of the most pro-Israeli in American history. Ending all pretence at even-handedness, it retreated from a strict land-for-peace interpretation of UN Security Council Resolution 242, once the keystone of US peace efforts, denounced Hizballah and Hamas as \"terrorist\" organisations - rather than recognising them to be legitimate national resistance movements to Israeli occupation - and refused to remove Syria itself from the state department list of states allegedly sponsoring terrorism. At the UN, the Americans protected Israel from international censure over human rights abuses, settlement building in the occupied territories and the confiscation of Arab land in and around East Jerusalem.</p> <p>Faced with tremendous American and Israeli pressure, Assad's only course was to stand firm on principle. As a result, Syria's peace negotiations with Israel made slow progress. He offered Israel \"full peace for full withdrawal\", making clear that a normalisation of relations could take place only once Israel had committed itself to a full withdrawal from the Golan and southern Lebanon. He insisted that any security arrangements agreed for the Golan should be \"balanced and symmetrical\" rather than weighted in Israel's favour. Israel was not used to an Arab leader putting up such stiff resistance to its wishes.</p> <p>Even his enemies conceded that, in his crisis-ridden career, Assad displayed two principal traits. The first was an exceptional degree of political foresight; cerebral and reserved, he plotted his moves with great deliberation. The second was a foxy and stubborn fighting instinct when driven to the wall, as he was by the Muslim Brothers at Hama in 1982 or by the Israelis in Lebanon a year later. On both occasions, he proved he could fight as dirty as anyone.</p> <p>Although he started out as a soldier, Assad rarely wore uniform or harangued the crowd from a balcony. He seemed to shrink from human contact, spending long hours at his desk and living a dull, exemplary life with his wife and children. Money, women or luxuries seemed to have no hold on him. Power was his drug.</p> <p>The source of his authority over his security chiefs, military commanders and party bosses seemed to lie in his superior intelligence. His favourite instrument of government was the telephone. With visitors, however, he could exercise considerable charm, and those who knew him intimately reported that he had a sardonic sense of humour and was often shaken by gusts of silent laughter.</p> <p>\u0095 Hafez al-Assad, politician, born October 6 1930; died June 10 2000</p>",

As officials confirmed at the weekend that ticket sales were running at barely half the expected level, opposition politicians stressed the German chancellor's personal role in overseeing preparations for the event.</p> <p>The chancellor was head of the regional administration in Lower Saxony in June 1990 when its capital, Hanover, won the right to stage Expo 2000. He remained in the job until two years ago. Mr Schr\u00f6der's standing is thus even more closely tied to the success of the event than was Tony Blair's to that of the Millennium Dome.</p> <p>Amid fears that taxpayers will be called on to meet huge losses, MPs urged Mr Schr\u00f6der to convene an all-party meeting with the organisers to find ways of attracting more visitors. Josef Hollerith of the Christian Social Union (CSU), the Bavarian arm of the Christian Democrat movement (CDU), added: \"As joint initiator of Expo, the federal chancellor is jointly responsible for the world exhibition's success.\"</p> <p>Expo 2000, which opened on June 1, is the latest in a long line of \"universal expositions\" stretching back to 1851. The or ganisers were hoping to lure 1.2m in the opening week, but on Saturday officials said attendance during the first eight days had been a mere 650,000.</p> <p>Germany's finance minister, Hans Eichel, reiterated the government's readiness to pick up the tab.\"The world fair is good and important for our country,\" he told the newspaper Bild am Sonntag. \"Should money be lacking at the end, we will help out together with the region of Lower Saxony.\"</p> <p>Local officials of the Green party, which is in coalition nationally with Mr Schr\u00f6der's Social Democrats, estimated that, at the current rate of attendance, the fair could rack up a loss of more than \u00a3400m.</p> <p>Oswald Metzger, the national budget spokesman for the Greens, said: \"The state underwrote Expo and can demand from the organisers that they come up with something.\"</p> <p>There were hopes that more visitors would turn up over the Whitsun holiday weekend. But Adolf Roth, CDU chairman of the budgetary committee of parliament, said that unless there was a sharp improvement \"the organisers are going to have to change their approach\".</p>",

      "bodyText": "Gerhard Schr\u00f6der's standing is at risk from the disastrous start to Expo 2000, the world fair in Hanover. As officials confirmed at the weekend that ticket sales were running at barely half the expected level, opposition politicians stressed the German chancellor's personal role in overseeing preparations for the event. The chancellor was head of the regional administration in Lower Saxony in June 1990 when its capital, Hanover, won the right to stage Expo 2000. He remained in the job until two years ago. Mr Schr\u00f6der's standing is thus even more closely tied to the success of the event than was Tony Blair's to that of the Millennium Dome. Amid fears that taxpayers will be called on to meet huge losses, MPs urged Mr Schr\u00f6der to convene an all-party meeting with the organisers to find ways of attracting more visitors. Josef Hollerith of the Christian Social Union (CSU), the Bavarian arm of the Christian Democrat movement (CDU), added: \"As joint initiator of Expo, the federal chancellor is jointly responsible for the world exhibition's success.\" Expo 2000, which opened on June 1, is the latest in a long line of \"universal expositions\" stretching back to 1851. The or ganisers were hoping to lure 1.2m in the opening week, but on Saturday officials said attendance during the first eight days had been a mere 650,000. Germany's finance minister, Hans Eichel, reiterated the government's readiness to pick up the tab.\"The world fair is good and important for our country,\" he told the newspaper Bild am Sonntag. \"Should money be lacking at the end, we will help out together with the region of Lower Saxony.\" Local officials of the Green party, which is in coalition nationally with Mr Schr\u00f6der's Social Democrats, estimated that, at the current rate of attendance, the fair could rack up a loss of more than \u00a3400m. Oswald Metzger, the national budget spokesman for the Greens, said: \"The state underwrote Expo and can demand from the organisers that they come up with something.\" There were hopes that more visitors would turn up over the Whitsun holiday weekend. But Adolf Roth, CDU chairman of the budgetary committee of parliament, said that unless there was a sharp improvement \"the organisers are going to have to change their approach\".",

      "bodyText": "Lawyers will today begin legal moves to waive death sentences handed to six prisoners in Texas, after the state's attorney general admitted that racial bias had been a factor in their trials. The admission represents an embarrassment for the Texas governor and presidential contender, George W Bush, who has claimed that he has never presided over the execution of an innocent person during more than five years in office. The review of the cases was forced on Texas by a supreme court decision last week, which overturned the death sentence of a convicted murderer because an expert prosecution witness at his trial had testified that the defendant's race could be a factor in deter mining whether he should face execution. Walter Quijano, a clinical psychologist, had argued that Victor Saldano could be considered dangerous on the grounds that Hispanics were \"over-represented\" in prisons, and therefore more of a threat to society. Under Texas law, the question of whether the defendant represents \"a continuing threat to society\" is one of the criteria for imposing the death penalty. On discovering that Mr Quijano had provided similar testimony in six other cases, resulting in death sentences, the office of the state's attorney general, John Cornyn, notified the defence lawyers in each case that the state would not oppose their motion to have the sentences overturned. \"The people of Texas want and deserve a system that affords the same fairness to everyone,\" Mr Cornyn said in a statement. He added that his staff had examined the records of 218 inmates executed in Texas since 1982 and found that none of the executions were based on \"this kind of testimony\" by Mr Quijano. It was not clear over the weekend whether previous executions may have resulted from racially charged testimony. Defence lawyers and civil rights activists have long pointed to the fact that while black Texans represent only 11% of the state population, they account for more than 40% of inmates on death row. The Texas record on the death penalty has come in for close scrutiny as Mr Bush's presidential bid gathers speed, at a time of creeping unease about the possibility that innocent prisoners are being executed. Texas leads the nation in executions and critics have argued that its system is weighted towards prosecutors. Much of the criticism has stressed the often poor quality of defence lawyers who - in the absence of a state public defender's office in Texas - are appointed by local courts and frequently lack experience or basic competence. One death row inmate, Calvin Burdine, is struggling to overturn his 1983 conviction on the grounds that his court-appointed lawyer slept through much of his two-day trial. Another, Gary Graham, who faces execution on June 22, was convicted on the strength of a single witness to a 1981 murder. His defence lawyer failed to present the jury with a police ballistics report showing that the lethal shot in the case could not have been fired from Graham's gun. He also failed to interview up to six witnesses who later said Graham was not the man they saw carry out the killing. In a New York Times interview yesterday, Graham's former lawyer, Ron Mock, admitted he had failed law school exams at a Texas university, had at one time owned 11 bars at the same time as practising law, and been a heavy whisky drinker at the time of the trial, but he claimed: \"It never affected my performance.\" Five other death row inmates have petitions against Mr Mock for providing ineffective legal defence.",

      "bodyText": "Security forces were on alert yesterday during elections in Montenegro that pitted supporters of the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic, against backers of the pro-western government in a state that is teetering on the brink of war. The polls come after days of heavily policed rallies in the capital, Podgorica, and the coastal city of Herceg Novi. Although the vote is for local governments in the two cities, it is viewed as a key test of opinion in the only republic still left alongside Serbia in Yugoslavia. The pro-Milosevic party has joined with hardline parties to form a Coalition for Yugoslavia and the pro-west forces are grouped under the For a Better Life coalition, whose main party is that of the pro-western president, Milo Djukanovic. After casting his own vote, Yugoslavia's prime minister, Momir Bulatovic, accused the US and the EU of spending \u00a312.5m in Montenegro with the \"aim of buying votes\". Mr Bulatovic, a close aide to Mr Milosevic, was referring to large amounts of international aid that have enabled Mr Djukanovic's government to pay salaries double those of state employees in Belgrade. \"What is happening now is really indecent,\" Mr Bulatovic said. \"We see foreign centres of financial and political power pouring money in and giving false promises.\" Tension increased on the eve of polling when the Yugoslav army chief of staff, Nebojsa Pavkovic, said Montenegro was \"supported by foreign factors\", adding that \"destructive forces in the country are trying to break its unity\". He added: \"We send a message to all of them, including their commanders, that the Yugoslav army is united, qualified for combat and has proven experience. We will prevent civil war at any price.\" The pro-Milosevic bloc has made allegations of ballot-rigging and warned that if it loses, it will not accept the result lying down. Belgrade controls the state's military forces, but Mr Djukanovic's government controls the police, who have received western aid and training. Analysts say a vote for the Milosevic bloc will symbolise a vote for the Yugoslav Federation, but a vote for the Better Life coalition is a vote for a referendum on independence. \"To some extent, these elections have nothing to do with local issues,\" said political scientist Srdjan Darmanovic, of the Centre for Democracy and Human Rights. \"They decide on who will rule the capital - and in any country that is important.\" The elections also give a third of the 600,000 population the right to vote, \"so act as a kind of mini-referendum\", he said. Both cities are marginal constituencies and the elections come half way through the presidential term of Mr Djukanovic, and half way through the term of the republic's government. Opinion is deeply polarised, Mr Darmanovic adds. At a rally last week the mayoral candidate of the pro-Milosevic bloc in the capital promised full employment and pledged that hundreds more apartments would be built.

His solution was a propeller-driven iron ship, with sails to save fuel in the right winds. The Great Britain was launched by the technology-loving Prince Albert in 1843. However, its design was considered so radical that only 50 nervous passengers bought tickets for the first journey to New York, despite the ship's luxurious facilities.</p> <p>The report says extensive conservation work must begin within five years. Rust is swelling the ship's iron plates, which are laid in the same way as the planks of a clinker-built wooden boat, and bursting them off their ribs. Dozens of rust holes are stuffed with chicken wire to stop pigeons flying into the hull and the 19th century dry dock itself is leaking, so the ship is surrounded by damp.</p> <p>Long before it collapsed, the ship would become so dangerous that the public would be barred from visiting.</p> <p>Ships were never designed to last longer than a few decades and the long-term conservation problems, particularly once they are taken out of the water, are notorious. The famous tea clipper, the Cutty Sark, kept in dry dock at Greenwich, in south-east London, has similar problems.</p> <p>The Great Britain's trustees, along with conservation architect, Julian Harrap, have devised a striking solution: a glass artificial waterline, which would cut the humidity, stop the rot, give the illusion of the ship floating on water, and still allow visitors to walk around the hull on the floor of the dock. The glass alone would cost \u00a31m, and the trustees have applied for a lottery grant towards the \u00a37m project.</p> <p>The Great Britain had a long but star-crossed working life. In 1846 it ran aground in Northern Ireland. None of the 180 passengers, including a troupe of 48 German dancing girls, was injured, and a group of clergymen conducted a service to calm their nerves.</p> <p>The ship lay on the beach \"like a useless saucepan\", as Brunel raged, for a year until he devised a rescue so expensive that it bankrupted the vessel's operators.</p> <p>The ship was sold in 1850 for \u00a318,000, a fraction of its original cost. Converted to sail it took thousands of emigrants to Australia. In 1861 it carried the first England cricket team to tour Australia - they played 12 matches, won six, lost two and drew four. In 1886 it ran aground again on the Falkland Islands and spent another 50 years as a floating wool store. Then in 1937 the ship was abandoned at Sparrow Cove. Historians never forgot the Great Britain, and eventually Jack Hayward, the Bahamas-based millionaire, backed a spectacular rescue, which led to the ship being towed back to Britain in 1970.</p> <p>More than 4m people have visited the ship since then, but visitor numbers have been falling and are now down to 100,000 a year. The trustees are convinced their new plan would reverse the slump.</p>",

Dozens of rust holes are stuffed with chicken wire to stop pigeons flying into the hull and the 19th century dry dock itself is leaking, so the ship is surrounded by damp. Long before it collapsed, the ship would become so dangerous that the public would be barred from visiting. Ships were never designed to last longer than a few decades and the long-term conservation problems, particularly once they are taken out of the water, are notorious. The famous tea clipper, the Cutty Sark, kept in dry dock at Greenwich, in south-east London, has similar problems. The Great Britain's trustees, along with conservation architect, Julian Harrap, have devised a striking solution: a glass artificial waterline, which would cut the humidity, stop the rot, give the illusion of the ship floating on water, and still allow visitors to walk around the hull on the floor of the dock. The glass alone would cost \u00a31m, and the trustees have applied for a lottery grant towards the \u00a37m project. The Great Britain had a long but star-crossed working life. In 1846 it ran aground in Northern Ireland. None of the 180 passengers, including a troupe of 48 German dancing girls, was injured, and a group of clergymen conducted a service to calm their nerves. The ship lay on the beach \"like a useless saucepan\", as Brunel raged, for a year until he devised a rescue so expensive that it bankrupted the vessel's operators. The ship was sold in 1850 for \u00a318,000, a fraction of its original cost. Converted to sail it took thousands of emigrants to Australia. In 1861 it carried the first England cricket team to tour Australia - they played 12 matches, won six, lost two and drew four. In 1886 it ran aground again on the Falkland Islands and spent another 50 years as a floating wool store. Then in 1937 the ship was abandoned at Sparrow Cove. Historians never forgot the Great Britain, and eventually Jack Hayward, the Bahamas-based millionaire, backed a spectacular rescue, which led to the ship being towed back to Britain in 1970. More than 4m people have visited the ship since then, but visitor numbers have been falling and are now down to 100,000 a year. The trustees are convinced their new plan would reverse the slump.",

      "body": "<p>Freakish is a word that has been readily associated with Ian Harvey and Gloucestershire over the past year, but while they are stocking up the one-day trophies, no one is going to become too concerned about that. </p> <p>Five wickets for Harvey brought Gloucestershire an unprecedented three successive wins in Lord's finals as the county whose achievements last summer were widely regarded as fun but fortuitous demanded the right to usurp an ageing Lancashire side as the leading one-day specialists in the land. </p> <p>Mark Alleyne, Gloucestershire's captain, certainly felt that way after this trophy had been secured by seven wickets with 19 balls to spare. \"Lancashire have deserved the credit over the years, and have the trophies to prove it, but things move on. Our success has been called a fluke and a freak. They can't say that now.\" </p> <p>\"The Freak\" was also a nickname bestowed on Harvey by his Australian team-mate, Shane Warne. Matthew Maynard, the defeated Glamorgan captain, preferred to call him \"unique\". Whatever way you look at it, Harvey's adaptable medium-pace has had an extraordinary impact down West - this five-wicket haul was his sixth in 30 one-day matches for the county. </p> <p>To face Harvey is to bat in a hall of mirrors. Deliveries come in all shapes and sizes. Reality is forever changing, deception abounds. Yorkers, slower balls (at least two varieties) and other subtle ruses never allowed Glamorgan's batsmen to settle. </p> <p>Maynard's combative and astute century had driven Glamorgan forward on their first Lord's appearance for 23 years but Harvey's reappearance in the closing overs forbid any thoughts of a final flourish. </p> <p>\"Harvey put the crushes on us with his last four overs,\" Maynard said. \"It was a vital spell. I was on top of my game when he came back into the attack, but he mixes it up so much that you can't quite set yourself to hit him. That's what makes him so dangerous. He has a belief that whatever trick he attempts, he can pull it off. Every now and then you get a unique one-day bowler and he is just that.\" </p> <p>Harvey's development of a slower ball originated from an unusual source. Countless batsmen have studied Steve Waugh's batting technique; few have watched videos of his slower ball. Harvey did that at the Australian Cricket Academy, and has combined his knowledge with the daring to experiment when the pressure is at its height. </p> <p>His 16 one-day internationals have brought only limited success (eight wickets at 65 question whether Harvey's variety act can ever play successfully in the elitist circles), but since Gloucestershire received word from Allan Border, the former Australia captain, that he would be a good overseas acquisition, his effect at county level has been remarkable. </p> <p>Experimentation is in vogue throughout Gloucestershire's bowling ranks - not just among the old sweats, such as the captain Mark Alleyne, but in the likes of Jamie Averis, a fixture in the side these days, and whose growing ability to bowl at the death was identified by Alleyne as a factor in the county's improvement. </p> <p>Harvey's impact came with the new ball and the old. Robert Croft, spooned high to mid-off, and his fellow Victorian, Matthew Elliott, dragged on. His return was even more striking: Keith Newell, Alex Wharf and Steve Watkin all floundering. Maynard, desperate to get back on strike, was run out by Kim Barnett's direct hit from point four balls before the end. </p> <p>A total of 225 was competitive, but slightly lower than Maynard had envisaged. Only Michael Powell had lent him much support, and even his 48 required 97 balls. The damage inflicted by Harvey was then continued by Gloucestershire's openers, Barnett and Tim Hancock, in a cavalier opening stand of 80 in 16 overs. </p> <p>Steve Watkin, presented with his first Lord's final at 35, found rhythm deserting him, Barnett feasted once more on his notorious square slash until he dragged on a wide one from Croft, and Hancock's bel ligerent half-century ended with Owen Parkin's brilliant return catch. Set fair, Alleyne and Matt Windows, making good use this season of his move up the order, then sensibly milked a limited attack in an unbeaten stand of 95. </p> <p>So hail the new one-day specialists. However much Harvey and Gloucestershire rail at the label, it is a fair one.

      "bodyText": "Freakish is a word that has been readily associated with Ian Harvey and Gloucestershire over the past year, but while they are stocking up the one-day trophies, no one is going to become too concerned about that. Five wickets for Harvey brought Gloucestershire an unprecedented three successive wins in Lord's finals as the county whose achievements last summer were widely regarded as fun but fortuitous demanded the right to usurp an ageing Lancashire side as the leading one-day specialists in the land. Mark Alleyne, Gloucestershire's captain, certainly felt that way after this trophy had been secured by seven wickets with 19 balls to spare. \"Lancashire have deserved the credit over the years, and have the trophies to prove it, but things move on. Our success has been called a fluke and a freak. They can't say that now.\" \"The Freak\" was also a nickname bestowed on Harvey by his Australian team-mate, Shane Warne. Matthew Maynard, the defeated Glamorgan captain, preferred to call him \"unique\". Whatever way you look at it, Harvey's adaptable medium-pace has had an extraordinary impact down West - this five-wicket haul was his sixth in 30 one-day matches for the county. To face Harvey is to bat in a hall of mirrors. Deliveries come in all shapes and sizes. Reality is forever changing, deception abounds. Yorkers, slower balls (at least two varieties) and other subtle ruses never allowed Glamorgan's batsmen to settle. Maynard's combative and astute century had driven Glamorgan forward on their first Lord's appearance for 23 years but Harvey's reappearance in the closing overs forbid any thoughts of a final flourish. \"Harvey put the crushes on us with his last four overs,\" Maynard said. \"It was a vital spell. I was on top of my game when he came back into the attack, but he mixes it up so much that you can't quite set yourself to hit him. That's what makes him so dangerous. He has a belief that whatever trick he attempts, he can pull it off. Every now and then you get a unique one-day bowler and he is just that.\" Harvey's development of a slower ball originated from an unusual source. Countless batsmen have studied Steve Waugh's batting technique; few have watched videos of his slower ball. Harvey did that at the Australian Cricket Academy, and has combined his knowledge with the daring to experiment when the pressure is at its height. His 16 one-day internationals have brought only limited success (eight wickets at 65 question whether Harvey's variety act can ever play successfully in the elitist circles), but since Gloucestershire received word from Allan Border, the former Australia captain, that he would be a good overseas acquisition, his effect at county level has been remarkable. Experimentation is in vogue throughout Gloucestershire's bowling ranks - not just among the old sweats, such as the captain Mark Alleyne, but in the likes of Jamie Averis, a fixture in the side these days, and whose growing ability to bowl at the death was identified by Alleyne as a factor in the county's improvement. Harvey's impact came with the new ball and the old. Robert Croft, spooned high to mid-off, and his fellow Victorian, Matthew Elliott, dragged on. His return was even more striking: Keith Newell, Alex Wharf and Steve Watkin all floundering. Maynard, desperate to get back on strike, was run out by Kim Barnett's direct hit from point four balls before the end. A total of 225 was competitive, but slightly lower than Maynard had envisaged. Only Michael Powell had lent him much support, and even his 48 required 97 balls. The damage inflicted by Harvey was then continued by Gloucestershire's openers, Barnett and Tim Hancock, in a cavalier opening stand of 80 in 16 overs. Steve Watkin, presented with his first Lord's final at 35, found rhythm deserting him, Barnett feasted once more on his notorious square slash until he dragged on a wide one from Croft, and Hancock's bel ligerent half-century ended with Owen Parkin's brilliant return catch. Set fair, Alleyne and Matt Windows, making good use this season of his move up the order, then sensibly milked a limited attack in an unbeaten stand of 95. So hail the new one-day specialists. However much Harvey and Gloucestershire rail at the label, it is a fair one. Harvey's impact in the championship has been less evident and Gloucestershire, languishing in the Second Division, showed their priorities by resting four players for last week's championship match against Essex. \"It won't become a habit,\" Alleyne asserted. \"We are not about to lose interest in the championship. We want promotion.\" Maynard, as the beaten captain, found little comfort in his gold award - rarely has it been so glowered at - but he will value it one day. He batted wonderfully. As an animated crowd of 20,000 basked in the sunshine, their contented chatter enlivening a previously drenched season, and Maynard drove first Jeremy Snape, then Averis thrillingly through the offside, it was finally possible to watch a succession of planes rising beyond Heathrow without wishing to be on every one of them.",
