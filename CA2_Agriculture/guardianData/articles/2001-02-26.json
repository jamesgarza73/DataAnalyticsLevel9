It was not certain whether the manager was consoling the man who had missed the final penalty, or vice-versa. </p> <p>For Liverpool, this was their second unconvincing performance of the week, and their second big result. As Houllier pointed out, it was also their fourth game in 10 days, and tiredness must certainly have taken a toll of their fluency. </p> <p>Nevertheless they made and missed plenty of chances, most of them falling to the otherwise impressive Fowler, whose opening goal was a splendid reward for his return to form and fitness.

Evans, whose tenure started with a victory in the same competition in 1995, could tell him that it doesn't always work out that way.

Arsenal had never conceded more than four in the history of the Premiership, and here they were five down within 40 minutes.

The bottom 10 in the First Division managed only a single point between them, with Sheffield Wednesday falling back into the relegation places after their 2-0 defeat at Preston . The Lancashire club join two other weekend winners, Nottingham Forest and Sheffield United , one point outside the play-offs. Millwall stretched their lead at the top of the Second Division, beating last-placed Oxford 2-0, while Walsall , their closest challengers, gave up a 2-0 lead to lose 3-2 at home to Wrexham. Craig Faulconbridge scored the Welsh side's winner in injury-time. Luton 's recent good form continued at Swindon, where they won 3-1. But they stay third from bottom because Bristol Rovers, above them on goal difference, secured a first home win of the season against Cambridge United . Most of the matches in the Third Division were tight affairs, with only one team winning by more than a single goal. That team was Shrewsbury who, having previously scored eight away goals all season, beat Rochdale 7-1. The 19-year-old Luke Rodgers, having scored his first goal of the season on Tuesday, hit his first ever hat-trick and was promptly sent off for overdoing the celebrations. Struggling York eased their relegation worries with a 1-1 draw at Brighton . The Seagulls slip to third thanks to Cardiff 's 4-2 in at Kidderminster yesterday, with three goals coming in the last four minutes and both sides scoring in injury-time.",

How strangely fortunes change in football. </p> <p>Burchill was given an immediate start by Ipswich in place of the suspended Marcus Stewart and immediately put a tiger in the Tractor Boys' tank, setting up both their goals and having what looked like a certain penalty turned down as memories of Ipswich Town's wretched start to the year were consigned to the dustbin of history.</p> <p>\"I thought I'd be on the bench to start but the gaffer's put me in and it worked out all right,\" the 20-year-old Scot said. \"Obviously I'm a striker and I want to score goals but if I can't score then I want to set them up for someone else.\" </p> <p>If he seemed extra motivated it was only because he was desperate to add to his six international caps. \"The Scotland manager Craig Brown has always said that if I play first-team football I'll be in the squad so hopefully if I play well with Ipswich I'll be back in the frame.\" </p> <p>Ipswich have him on a three-month loan with an option to buy and although their manager would not reveal the fee being quoted, Birmingham had been asked for \u00a31.5m - a snip at today's prices. </p> <p>Over 90 minutes George Burley liked what he saw. \"I thought Mark did very well. He can be very pleased with his debut in the Premiership. He looked lively, he had a few shots blocked, so overall he contributed a lot of things to the team.\" </p> <p>Burchill, in fact, wasted no time in showing why he is such an exciting talent. He may be only 5ft 8in in his socks but he has lightning pace, superb control and the sort of acute positional sense that can unsettle any defence, as he showed in the seventh minute when he accelerated past Paul Gerrard. The goalkeeper simply took his legs away and seemed as surprised as anyone when the referee waved play on. </p> <p>Everton had clearly come with a point in mind and they settled down to what was heading for a goalless draw when Graham Poll intervened again. Alex Nyarko had already been booked and when he mistimed his tackle on Titus Bramble the referee produced red to send off his seventh player this season. </p> <p>Walter Smith was not impressed. \"He made two fouls in a game that wasn't physical at all - and for someone to get booked twice in the second half can't be justified,\" the Everton manager said. </p> <p>Until then Everton had looked reasonably solid, but when Burley began putting on more attackers the visitors had too much to think about and fell behind in the 82nd minute. </p> <p>First Burchill put in a cross that was headed away by the new England recruit Michael Ball, but only to the onrushing Matt Holland, who half-volleyed it back into the net. Two minutes later Burchill crossed again and Alun Armstrong met the ball with a textbook downward header.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Mark Burchill might have been playing for Birmingham City in the Worthington Cup final this weekend; he could have been watching from the bench as Celtic took on Hibernian; instead he finds himself with the fifth-placed club in the Premiership and chasing a place in Europe. How strangely fortunes change in football. Burchill was given an immediate start by Ipswich in place of the suspended Marcus Stewart and immediately put a tiger in the Tractor Boys' tank, setting up both their goals and having what looked like a certain penalty turned down as memories of Ipswich Town's wretched start to the year were consigned to the dustbin of history. \"I thought I'd be on the bench to start but the gaffer's put me in and it worked out all right,\" the 20-year-old Scot said. \"Obviously I'm a striker and I want to score goals but if I can't score then I want to set them up for someone else.\" If he seemed extra motivated it was only because he was desperate to add to his six international caps. \"The Scotland manager Craig Brown has always said that if I play first-team football I'll be in the squad so hopefully if I play well with Ipswich I'll be back in the frame.\" Ipswich have him on a three-month loan with an option to buy and although their manager would not reveal the fee being quoted, Birmingham had been asked for \u00a31.5m - a snip at today's prices. Over 90 minutes George Burley liked what he saw. \"I thought Mark did very well. He can be very pleased with his debut in the Premiership. He looked lively, he had a few shots blocked, so overall he contributed a lot of things to the team.\" Burchill, in fact, wasted no time in showing why he is such an exciting talent. He may be only 5ft 8in in his socks but he has lightning pace, superb control and the sort of acute positional sense that can unsettle any defence, as he showed in the seventh minute when he accelerated past Paul Gerrard. The goalkeeper simply took his legs away and seemed as surprised as anyone when the referee waved play on. Everton had clearly come with a point in mind and they settled down to what was heading for a goalless draw when Graham Poll intervened again. Alex Nyarko had already been booked and when he mistimed his tackle on Titus Bramble the referee produced red to send off his seventh player this season. Walter Smith was not impressed. \"He made two fouls in a game that wasn't physical at all - and for someone to get booked twice in the second half can't be justified,\" the Everton manager said. Until then Everton had looked reasonably solid, but when Burley began putting on more attackers the visitors had too much to think about and fell behind in the 82nd minute. First Burchill put in a cross that was headed away by the new England recruit Michael Ball, but only to the onrushing Matt Holland, who half-volleyed it back into the net. Two minutes later Burchill crossed again and Alun Armstrong met the ball with a textbook downward header.",

Steve Howey was shipped out for \u00a33.5m in the summer; he returned to inspire City's first clean sheet away from Maine Road since November alongside Richard Dunne. </p> <p>\"We desperately needed that,\" Howey said. \"That can be our springboard.

A team with good spirit and average players will beat a side full of great individuals but with poor spirit any day.\" </p> <p>After a scrappy first half, brightened only by Wayne Quinn's stinging free-kick that flew just wide, City emerged into the snow flurries to dominate the second period.

Darren Huckerby, obviously in need of fattening up, missed an easier chance moments later. </p> <p>Even then, Newcastle rarely threatened until Warren Barton's goal-bound shot was deflected over the crossbar in the dying seconds by Howey's backside. \"I had to get something on the shot,\" added the defender. \"It would have been devastating to have conceded, especially because they didn't deserve to get back into it.\" </p> <p>\"Steve Howey was 10 out of 10 today, probably just in front of Richard with 9.5,\" said Royle. \"I've heard plenty of derisory comments about us, saying that we shouldn't have been promoted last season. People will put this down to Newcastle having an off-day, but we made them play badly. If we defend like that from now on, we'll be all right.\" </p> <p>It was hard to say the same of Newcastle. A week training in the La Manga sun was supposed to put colour on Geordie cheeks. But after Alan Shearer's cross was deflected by Danny Granville and Clarence Acuna nodded over an empty net early in the second half, they descended into sloppy lethargy and a third successive defeat. </p> <p>Shearer's mind was as sharp as ever, but his body could not respond after two months on the treatment table. Kieron Dyer's shin problems re-surfaced; he drowned in the midfield muddle and later hobbled out of the England squad despite his manager's attempts at dissuasion. Shola Ameobi may follow suit from the Under-21s after sustaining a back injury. </p> <p>\"We're a broken outfit,\" the home manager Bobby Robson admitted. \"We looked a yard off the pace.

And Solano wants to play for his country again?\" Peru's coach Julio Cesar Uribe is hoping to tempt the wing out of international retirement after naming him to play Honduras in Miami next month. </p> <p>\"One goal was going to win it,\" added Robson. \"Near the end Lomana Lua Lua had a one on one with the defender on the right and put it out for a goal kick.

The other parties can't keep pretending that you can cut taxes without cutting public services.\"</p> <p>The party \u0096 which is in coalition alliance with Labour in both the Scottish parliament and the Welsh assembly \u0096 wants to provide an extra 3,300 training places for doctors and an additional 11,400 for nurses and midwives of five years.</p> <p>Mr Kennedy also pledged to restore free NHS eye and dental check-ups for all, providing 11,000 extra hospital beds over five years to cut waiting times and paying for all long-term personal care for the elderly.</p> <p>This plan has already been agreed in Edinburgh for Scottish pensioners after the Scottish Lib Dem leader, Jim Wallace, gave Labour an ultimatum.</p> <p>The revenue garnered from the new top rate of income tax would also pay for a \u00a3500m investment in dental services.</p> <p>On education the party announced a scheme to fund an additional 5,000 secondary school teacher places with the Lib Dems' \"penny for education\" tax on the basic rate of income tax.</p> <p>That would also pay for classroom assistants for five to 11-year-olds, and cut class sizes to 25, the party claim.</p> <p>In a bid to head off criticism of being the only party advocating tax increases, the Lib Dems will also propose an annual \"tax contract\" with the British people, promising to spell out exactly what public money is spent on, and how any changes have affected income tax payers.</p> <p>The contract would be posted to every household in the UK.</p> <p>The Liberal Democrat treasury spokesman, Matthew Taylor, said the contract would make the Lib Dems the first party to forego the option of \"stealth taxes\", which he said boosted the total tax-take but went largely unnoticed by voters because they did not affect income tax.</p> <p>The proposals come amid a flurry of big policy announcements from all the major parties, stoking up the prospect of an early April election in the wake of Gordon Brown's budget on March 7.</p> <p><b>Special reports</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/countdown/\">Election countdown</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/\">Budget 2001</a></p> <p><b>Previous budgets</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2000/\">Budget 2000</a><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget99/\">Budget 1999</a></p> <p><b>Talk about it</b><br><a href=\"http://talk.theguardian.com/WebX?13@@.ee7f11c\">Brown's election budget</a></p> <p><b>Related articles</b><br><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/charleskennedy/story/0,7369,371707,00.html\">22.09.2000: Kennedy's tick-box tax plan</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/budget2001/story/0,7369,441181,00.html\">22.02.2001: Sketch: The \u00a31m question</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.societytheguardian.com/nhsfinance/story/0,8150,441083,00.html\">21.02.2001: Ministers dismiss NHS plea for cash</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.societytheguardian.com/nhsfinance/story/0,8150,434267,00.html\">06.02.2001: Rationing of NHS services and drugs is 'inevitable'</a><br></p> <p><b>Useful links</b><br><a href=\"http://www.libdems.org.uk/\" target=\"_new\">Liberal Democrat party</a><br><a href=\"http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/\" target=\"_new\">HM Treasury</a></p>",

      "bodyText": "The Liberal Democrat leader, Charles Kennedy, has called for a new 50p in the pound upper tax rate to pay for an increase in health spending. Setting out an alternative budget ahead of the official statement next Wednesday from the chancellor, Gordon Brown, Mr Kennedy announced proposals for a \u00a31,000 pay rise for Britain's worst-off nurses and midwives, and a five year plan for an expansion of doctors and nurses numbers. Speaking at the launch of the Lib Dems' \"alternative budget\" this morning Mr Kennedy said: \"People know that you can't get something for nothing. The other parties can't keep pretending that you can cut taxes without cutting public services.\" The party \u0096 which is in coalition alliance with Labour in both the Scottish parliament and the Welsh assembly \u0096 wants to provide an extra 3,300 training places for doctors and an additional 11,400 for nurses and midwives of five years. Mr Kennedy also pledged to restore free NHS eye and dental check-ups for all, providing 11,000 extra hospital beds over five years to cut waiting times and paying for all long-term personal care for the elderly. This plan has already been agreed in Edinburgh for Scottish pensioners after the Scottish Lib Dem leader, Jim Wallace, gave Labour an ultimatum. The revenue garnered from the new top rate of income tax would also pay for a \u00a3500m investment in dental services. On education the party announced a scheme to fund an additional 5,000 secondary school teacher places with the Lib Dems' \"penny for education\" tax on the basic rate of income tax. That would also pay for classroom assistants for five to 11-year-olds, and cut class sizes to 25, the party claim. In a bid to head off criticism of being the only party advocating tax increases, the Lib Dems will also propose an annual \"tax contract\" with the British people, promising to spell out exactly what public money is spent on, and how any changes have affected income tax payers. The contract would be posted to every household in the UK. The Liberal Democrat treasury spokesman, Matthew Taylor, said the contract would make the Lib Dems the first party to forego the option of \"stealth taxes\", which he said boosted the total tax-take but went largely unnoticed by voters because they did not affect income tax. The proposals come amid a flurry of big policy announcements from all the major parties, stoking up the prospect of an early April election in the wake of Gordon Brown's budget on March 7.

      "body": "<p>It is 10.19pm when the party leader rises to make his speech to parliament. When he sits down, the clock has moved on to 10.20pm. There is total silence. It is broken only by the sound of an orgasmic stage-whispered scream of approval from the balcony: \"Yessssssssss!\" It is coming from the leader's speechwriter: \"He did it! He did it! To the second! One minute 30 seconds precisely. Perfect!\" By now the next speaker is already on his feet. He is greeted with silence too. Silence is the characteristic response to speeches here, especially when it is well past dinner time in the best city for eating out in Europe.</p> <p>This is the European parliament in Strasbourg, where the debate - on the harmonisation of laws relating to food supplements - is being attended by precisely 17 of the 626 parliamentarians, plus 18 members of staff, eight people in the public galleries and 33 interpreters (three for each of the European Union's 11 official languages). The vast and stunning egg-shaped chamber is lit for the occasion by enough wattage to illuminate a fair-sized third world capital.</p> <p>The strict time limit is one of the mercies. Hence the speechwriter's delight: a fraction longer than the allotted 90 seconds and the microphone would have been switched off. But the silence that greeted this particular leader's speech was more than normally profound.</p> <p>The speaker was Jeffrey Titford of the UK Independence party, which - according to its 7% win of the vote in the 1999 European elections - is the fourth-largest party in Britain. (The big four party leaders are thus Tony Blair, William Hague, Charles Kennedy and Titford.) It is also the only one of the dozens of parties represented in this place totally committed to withdrawal from the EU. Titford was against harmonisation, surprisingly enough, arguing that British law was perfectly adequate. He's always against. He is the clergyman addressing the sinners in the whorehouse. Or Lucifer in the cathedral, depending on your point of view.</p> <p>Somewhere between a half and three-fifths of Britain's electorate agree with Titford that Britain should seek an amicable divorce from the EU, and in 1999 Ukip (pronounced you-kip) won three MEPs. However, the former party leader, Michael Holmes, has not been sighted in almost a year, partly through ill-health, partly through disaffection. He is rumoured to be on the brink of joining the Greens, leaving just Titford and his sidekick, Nigel Farage.</p> <p>Holmes's disappearance is merely one strand in a skein of vituperation and hatred that characterises Ukip . Earlier this month, the party's founder, Dr Alan Sked, claimed in the Spectator that the party was now enmeshed with the extreme right. The front page advertised \" Ukip and the fascists\".</p> <p>Sked's evidence seemed slender. Much rested on a meeting between Farage and a party member who also belonged to the openly racist British National party. Farage says this was someone recruited by Sked, and that the meeting was to tell the man he was unwanted. If there was serious evidence linking the party with racists, at least 600 people in Strasbourg would be delighted to use it. But even Chris Huhne, the Liberal Democrat MEP who is one of their sternest critics, admits: \"They're not fascists, they're not corrupt and they're not morons. Some of their members are headbangers, though.\"</p> <p>They certainly are. The party's Scottish organiser has just been kicked off the executive for a year after questioning, in letters to newspapers, the extent of the Holocaust. Farage claims Ukip is the victim of \"entryism\". For what it's worth, the two men sit dead-centre of the parliament's semi-circle, close to the Lib Dems but at the back: traditional refuge of the most truculent members of any class. They are in a loose alliance known as EDD (Europe of Democracy and Diversities): a ragbag of 16 anti-federalists, comprising six French rustics, four Danes, three Dutch Calvinist ministers and the two Britons, but not rightwingers such as Jean-Marie Le Pen.</p> <p>Even in the EDD, the Britons are out on a limb. Farage and Titford want Britain out, plain and simple. Thus John Bowis, the former Tory minister who is now an MEP, can say: \"They are a tiny, tiny extreme element of a fringe part of the parliament. I just think they're irrelevant.\" But they may be very relevant in many rural constituencies come the general election. And they do at least have a coherent position - unlike the Tories, whose representatives here are horribly split.</p> <p>Ukip, however, is an incoherent party, and its internal schisms are certainly worthy of the far right. It was founded in 1993 by Sked, a lecturer at the London School of Economics, and bumbled on quietly until the 1997 election, when it was totally swamped in the anti-Europe market by Jimmy Goldsmith's big-money, high-profile Referendum party. Then Goldsmith died, leaving a vacuum which Ukip filled with vicious infighting. But at the 1999 European elections, it was suddenly well-placed to pick up protest votes. And, since Britain was now using a regional proportional representation system, it was even better placed to turn them into seats. \"It was a delicious double irony,\" says Farage, elected from the south-east region. \"For a parliament I want no part of, under a system I despise, I found myself blinking into the cameras at one in the morning saying how proud I was.\"</p> <p>With just a few more votes, Ukip might have won five seats. But when Holmes, the abrasive millionaire who had succeeded Sked, was dumped and then had a stroke, only this odd couple were left.</p> <p>Titford is usually referred to as the Frinton undertaker (Frinton-on-Sea is generally presumed to be a good place for the trade). Actually, he had a string of funeral businesses on the east coast until he sold up in 1989 and retired at 55 to concentrate on sea fishing and golf. He had been in politics before, as a Tory, reaching the dizzy heights of chairman of the public health committee (and vice-chairman of recreation and gardens) on the old Clacton urban district council.</p> <p>Titford was a bit bored by retirement, but he has now ridden his little anti-Euro hobby-horse out of control. In 45 years of marriage, his job never took him much further than Harwich. Now he is away perpetually, spreading Frinton's world-view, his wife is \"supportive but a bit exasperated\". Except when talking about Sked (\"he's demented\"), Titford is an emollient man, a sort of Willie Whitelaw figure, and an ideal leader for such a fractious party - \"8,000 members and 9,000 egos\", as one supporter put it.</p> <p>Titford says little, which means he is outshone by Farage, a 36-year-old metals broker with wild eyes and the air of a successful estate agent. Both men are rather obviously British: non-linguists in a building of suave polyglots. Together, they can come over like Caldicott and Charters, the old buffers who kept talking about the Test score while travelling Europe in The Lady Vanishes. But they are not obvious xenophobes (Farage's wife is German) and have a nice - very British - line in self-deprecating humour. Indeed, the Ukip 's European parliament contingent laugh a lot, a rarity in Strasbourg.</p> <p>They have a fair bit to laugh about. It is not difficult for them to embarrass the establishment, and their most successful ongoing stunt has been to pool the excess on their travel expenses and use it to fund the defence of \"the metric martyr\", the Sunderland greengrocer prosecuted last month for selling fruit in pounds and ounces. The parliament has demanded the MEPs return \u00a311,500.</p> <p>Last Wednesday, Titford and Farage were summoned to appear before Richard Balfe, a long-serving Labour MEP who is on the College of Quaestors, a souped-up privileges committee. The meeting was inconclusive. Balfe refused even to confirm it had taken place.</p> <p>\"Can you tell me what the issue is?\" I asked Balfe.</p> <p>\"Of course not. It's the College of Quaestors, not a public meeting,\" said Balfe indignantly.</p> <p>\"Isn't it public?\"</p> <p>\"It never has been. Whoever I talked to, [it] is between me and them.\"</p> <p>In a Europe full of Balfes, it is not difficult to portray the whole project as ludicrous.</p> <p>It is easy to subvert the parliamentary process as well. At the EDD group meeting last Tuesday, it was decided on the spur-of-the-moment to turn up en masse at that night's plenary session to try to get the food supplement measure sent back, and thus delayed for ages. It was not a well-planned plot, but the European parliament's sittings are so thinly attended it did not need to be. Their procedural move failed by just one vote: 16-15, with 595 members missing, presumed at dinner.</p> <p>This would have been a routine oppositional ploy at Westminster, but other (non-British) MEPs were incensed. \"Immoral!\" they kept saying. The British view is more phlegmatic. It is accepted that the debating chamber is a waste of time. Except for votes (members have to vote to get paid), the room is empty even when it is not dinner-time. \"The place where you change minds is in committee,\" says Huhne. \"You can actually alter legislation quite effectively there, and that's where Ukip doesn't play a part. They're a waste of space.\"</p> <p>\"Yes, it's true,\" says Richard North, the Ukip staffer who was so proud of his leader's timekeeping. \"If you're very, very good, and work very, very hard, you can get to change a couple of words. Wow!\"</p> <p>\"I'm supposed to be on the fisheries committee,\" says Farage. \"The cod recovery scheme was introduced with no reference to the committee whatever, because total competence rests with the commission. There's no point in going. We send a staff member to observe instead. We haven't come here to do a Billy Graham bit and convert everybody. We haven't come to change Europe. We've come to find out how it works and what it costs, and take that message back to the British people.\"</p> <p>They take the message round tirelessly, despite Mrs Titford's reservations. And there is no doubt it keeps being well received. What that means in electoral terms remains to be seen in May, and in the referendum on the euro that will follow. But clearly few people in Britain doubt that much of what goes on in European institutions is damnable. The question, which we all have to ask ourselves, is whether it is an acceptable price to pay for the greatness of the project.</p> <p>The two Ukip men left doubt behind long ago. In the members' cafe I asked how they would vote if the European commission proposed a motion in favour of motherhood and apple pie.</p> <p>\"I'd abstain,\" said Farage, \"on the grounds that it's none of Europe's business.\"</p> <p>\"I'd vote against,\" said Titford. \"There'd probably be a hidden agenda.\"</p> <p>Correction (Published February 27th 2001) attached to this article:</p> <p>\u0095 Yesterday's G2 cover story, was about two UK Independence party members of the European parliament. It was set at the parliament's Strasbourg site, but the photo on pages 2-3 showed the parliament's Brussels building.

      "bodyText": "The US software giant Microsoft began its appeal today against the break-up of the firm for anti-competitive practices. Some commentators have said that the outcome of the legal showdown, at the US court of appeals for the District of Columbia, may depend as much on the judge who made the original ruling as on the legal arguments. US district judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's comments outside the courtroom - comparing the Microsoft chairman, Bill Gates, to Napoleon and suggesting company officials were not \"grown-ups\" - have injected extra controversy into the case. Legal experts have said the comments have made the job more difficult for government lawyers who are trying to preserve their historic antitrust victory. William Kovacic, a law professor at George Washington university, said: \"Nothing good will co me to the government plaintiffs from all of this. \"In conscious or unconscious ways, the court of appeals will feel fewer inhibitions to second-guess Jackson's findings concerning crucial pieces of evidence.\" Microsoft has \"a 50% chance of walking completely\" thanks to the judges post-trial statements, University of Baltimore law professor Bob Lande said. Before the comments, he gave the government a two-to-one edge. In interviews with reporters and authors writing books on Microsoft's legal ordeal, Judge Jackson made scathing attacks on Mr Gates, the company's legal team and the US district court which is hearing the company's appeal today and tomorrow. The district appeals court has scheduled seven hours of arguments, which began at 1430 GMT today, and will be completed by tomorrow. This is an unusually large amount of time for the argument, even more than the parties requested. The extra time will be spent questioning Judge Jackson's factual findings, in which he laid out how he thought Microsoft used anti-competitive practices and harmed consumers, the appellate judges said. Publicly, the justice department and Microsoft have both played down the significance of Judge Jackson's words. Generally, appeals are heard by only three judges. One former member of the court, Whitewater prosecutor Kenneth Starr, said it was unprecedented for all the judges to hear it. Mr Starr, who now works for ProComp, a group financed by Microsoft competitors, said the court had scheduled more time because it wanted to be taken more seriously and reduce the chances of its findings being overturned.

      "bodyText": "Low morale and chronic staff shortages have plunged family doctors into \"crisis\", the British Medical Association warned today. GPs are facing a \"daily struggle\" to give their patients the care they need while trying to take on board government initiatives using \"woefully insufficient resources\", says the BMA's general practitioners committee (GPC). GPC chairman Dr John Chisholm has launched a furious attack on the government and called on GPs to start a media offensive on pay and workforce issues. In an open letter to the UK's 36,000 family doctors, Dr Chisholm said this year's 2.3% pay award was the \"last straw\" for GPs. The GPC campaign follows a survey of Scottish GPs, which revealed that 60% were considering a career change or taking early retirement. More than half said morale was poor and more than 70% said it had worsened in the past five years. Dr Chisholm is starting negotiations with the health secretary, Alan Milburn, this week in an attempt to drive up a better deal on pay and conditions for GPs. Dr Chisholm's letter says: \"General practice in the UK is in crisis. Morale within the profession has plunged to new depths. \"Quite clearly, this government's interest in the problems of general practice is superficial. \"It has complacently shovelled more and more work on to general practitioners without giving the profession the numbers needed to carry it out. Now we are saying that we have had enough.\" As well as dissatisfaction over this year's pay settlement, Dr Chisholm said GPs feel the government is \"hopelessly short\" of its targets - set in the NHS plan - to increase the number of family doctors by 2,000 within the next five years. Latest figures show only 110 extra GPs have been recruited in the last year but the BMA claims the government should be looking to take on at least 10,000. This spring, the GPC will survey all its members to highlight the extent of the problems GPs are facing. A BMA spokeswoman said: \"Dr Chisholm's letter is the opening salvo in a plan of action. The nationwide survey, which we will launch in the next few weeks, will provide us with further evidence.\" She added: \"Doctors don't traditionally go on strike but they are sufficiently demoralised to think that the normal path of negotiations are not enough. \"It is up to the UK's 36,000 GPs how this campaign progresses.\" The Department of Health rebutted the GPC's claims. \"The recruitment target set out in the NHS plan is achievable,\" said a spokeswoman, \"and the figure of 2,000 is a floor rather than a ceiling. \"We have set up the primary care workforce review to look at boosting GP figures and will be working with the professional bodies to do so.\" The spokeswoman disputed Dr Chisholm's quoted 2.3% pay rise figure, claiming that after practice costs were added to GPs' allowances, the award offered was much higher. Ministers and officials will continue negotiations with professional bodies to build up relations between the department and GPs, she said. The shadow health secretary, Dr Liam Fox, commented: \"It is easy to see why GPs are in despair. There is an increasing gap between the government's rhetoric and the reality of the health service. \"This time last year Alan Milburn claimed that Labour would transform general practice. Instead, his policies have resulted in the lowest morale anyone can remember. \"Given the constant reorganisation, centralisation and scapegoating of the medical profession, it is little wonder that GP recruitment is so poor.\"",

      "body": "<p>Higher education hardly featured in the last election. All parties agreed to \"wait for Dearing\" - Lord Dearing's review of university funding. Dearing reported shortly after the election but, alas, Labour declined to follow his proposals. They would have required all students to contribute to their tuition fees, but would have provided maintenance grants for poor students. Labour did the opposite: excusing students from low income homes from an annual \u00a31,000 contribution to tuition fees but illogically requiring them to meet much higher maintenance costs (up to \u00a34,000 or more) through loans. Four years on from the last election, the position of poor students - and the nation's 100 universities - is even grimmer. Hence last week's report from the vice-chancellors setting out four options in which the \u00a31bn shortfall in university funding could be closed.</p> <p>There are three fundamental problems underlying the crisis in Britain's universities. The first is financial: a fall of almost 40% in resources per student over the last 12 years on top of a 20% fall in the previous 13 years. The second is the slowness with which a university system designed for an intellectual elite is adapting to the challenge of becoming a mass higher-education system. Where a generation ago only about 10% of young people attended university, now 40% of young people aged between 18 and 30 participate in higher education courses. The prime minister wants to lift this proportion to 50%. The third problem is the old pretence, which insisted all universities provided degrees of equal value, has become even more absurd with the emergence of a mass education system.</p> <p>One reason why the vice-chancellors, who are due to debate the four funding options at the end of this week, are likely to emerge with a fudged consensus is be cause of their diverging interests. Ministers argue their second comprehensive spending review will produce a major investment in science, access courses and general higher-education spending. It will, but it will not make up the shortfall of the previous 25 years of squeeze. Universities have a dilapidated air. Laboratory facilities have been run down, library hours drastically curtailed and academic salaries ruthlessly reduced. Faced with mounting debt, students are becoming far more discriminating about the courses they intend to follow. Several former polytechnics have not just shut courses, but even campuses. Over 50 universities are more than 2% below their student recruitment targets.</p> <p>What should happen now? The Conservatives want an endowment fund, under which university places would be financed, but they have not explained how the \u00a3100bn would be raised. In theory it would give universities more freedom, but the Tories are insisting that they would not allow universities to set their own fees or numbers. Labour, too, is opposed to universities setting their own fees - at least for the duration of the next parliament. The most \"inclusive\" step ministers could take would be to excuse poor students from both tuition and maintenance costs. This would be much better than the present muddle of exemptions, bursaries and special access deals. It would open the way for a future government to allow universities to set differential fees, knowing poor students would be protected. Both major parties have ruled out a fully funded higher education system. Axiomatically, if standards are not to deteriorate, universities must raise more funds themselves. Top-up fees are the least worst option.</p>",

They would have required all students to contribute to their tuition fees, but would have provided maintenance grants for poor students. Labour did the opposite: excusing students from low income homes from an annual \u00a31,000 contribution to tuition fees but illogically requiring them to meet much higher maintenance costs (up to \u00a34,000 or more) through loans. Four years on from the last election, the position of poor students - and the nation's 100 universities - is even grimmer. Hence last week's report from the vice-chancellors setting out four options in which the \u00a31bn shortfall in university funding could be closed. There are three fundamental problems underlying the crisis in Britain's universities. The first is financial: a fall of almost 40% in resources per student over the last 12 years on top of a 20% fall in the previous 13 years. The second is the slowness with which a university system designed for an intellectual elite is adapting to the challenge of becoming a mass higher-education system. Where a generation ago only about 10% of young people attended university, now 40% of young people aged between 18 and 30 participate in higher education courses. The prime minister wants to lift this proportion to 50%. The third problem is the old pretence, which insisted all universities provided degrees of equal value, has become even more absurd with the emergence of a mass education system. One reason why the vice-chancellors, who are due to debate the four funding options at the end of this week, are likely to emerge with a fudged consensus is be cause of their diverging interests. Ministers argue their second comprehensive spending review will produce a major investment in science, access courses and general higher-education spending. It will, but it will not make up the shortfall of the previous 25 years of squeeze. Universities have a dilapidated air. Laboratory facilities have been run down, library hours drastically curtailed and academic salaries ruthlessly reduced. Faced with mounting debt, students are becoming far more discriminating about the courses they intend to follow. Several former polytechnics have not just shut courses, but even campuses. Over 50 universities are more than 2% below their student recruitment targets. What should happen now? The Conservatives want an endowment fund, under which university places would be financed, but they have not explained how the \u00a3100bn would be raised. In theory it would give universities more freedom, but the Tories are insisting that they would not allow universities to set their own fees or numbers. Labour, too, is opposed to universities setting their own fees - at least for the duration of the next parliament. The most \"inclusive\" step ministers could take would be to excuse poor students from both tuition and maintenance costs. This would be much better than the present muddle of exemptions, bursaries and special access deals. It would open the way for a future government to allow universities to set differential fees, knowing poor students would be protected. Both major parties have ruled out a fully funded higher education system. Axiomatically, if standards are not to deteriorate, universities must raise more funds themselves. Top-up fees are the least worst option.",

      "body": "<p>The headmaster at the centre of allegations of bullying at Westminster Abbey's choir school is being forced out after the governors unexpectedly withdrew their support.</p> <p>Roger Overend, headmaster for the past four years, was summoned to a meeting in the abbey's Jerusalem Chamber at the end of last week and ordered to resign or face the sack.</p> <p>He is consulting his union, the National Association of Head Teachers, but is said to have told friends that he knows he will not return.</p> <p>The move follows months of controversy over the running of the school, with some parents accusing the headmaster of bullying their children. Until last week Wesley Carr, the dean of the abbey and one of the school governors, had given Mr Overend his full support and the abbey dismissed the claims as unrepresentative.</p> <p>Even the Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, has been drawn into the row. On Friday, the very day that Mr Overend was told he would have to go, Dr Carey wrote to a concerned and long-standing worshipper at the abbey, dismissing media reports of trouble at the school as inaccurate.</p> <p>Parents have been told that the head is taking extended leave but they were offered what was described as counselling by the dean and senior members of the abbey's staff when they returned their boys to the school at the end of the half term break on Friday.</p> <p>The abbey's choir - in existence for nearly 1,000 years - is world famous for its singing at state occasions, notably the funeral of the Princess of Wales.</p> <p>But the choir has been in turmoil since the dean dismissed the popular and distinguished former organist Martin Neary three years ago. Although the dismissal was upheld by a subsequent inquiry the dean was criticised for his management style.</p> <p>The abbey is a so-called royal peculiar, under the Queen's patronage but run by the dean, who is also chairman of the school's governing body.</p> <p>In recent months four boys have been withdrawn and one expelled from the 37-pupil school, which is next to the abbey and is overlooked by the Department for Education across the road.</p> <p>There have been persistent allegations of bullying against Mr Overend, including one that he ordered a boy from his bed and harangued him for half an hour for taking a packet of crisps from the canteen.

      "bodyText": "The headmaster at the centre of allegations of bullying at Westminster Abbey's choir school is being forced out after the governors unexpectedly withdrew their support. Roger Overend, headmaster for the past four years, was summoned to a meeting in the abbey's Jerusalem Chamber at the end of last week and ordered to resign or face the sack. He is consulting his union, the National Association of Head Teachers, but is said to have told friends that he knows he will not return. The move follows months of controversy over the running of the school, with some parents accusing the headmaster of bullying their children. Until last week Wesley Carr, the dean of the abbey and one of the school governors, had given Mr Overend his full support and the abbey dismissed the claims as unrepresentative. Even the Archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, has been drawn into the row. On Friday, the very day that Mr Overend was told he would have to go, Dr Carey wrote to a concerned and long-standing worshipper at the abbey, dismissing media reports of trouble at the school as inaccurate. Parents have been told that the head is taking extended leave but they were offered what was described as counselling by the dean and senior members of the abbey's staff when they returned their boys to the school at the end of the half term break on Friday. The abbey's choir - in existence for nearly 1,000 years - is world famous for its singing at state occasions, notably the funeral of the Princess of Wales. But the choir has been in turmoil since the dean dismissed the popular and distinguished former organist Martin Neary three years ago. Although the dismissal was upheld by a subsequent inquiry the dean was criticised for his management style. The abbey is a so-called royal peculiar, under the Queen's patronage but run by the dean, who is also chairman of the school's governing body. In recent months four boys have been withdrawn and one expelled from the 37-pupil school, which is next to the abbey and is overlooked by the Department for Education across the road. There have been persistent allegations of bullying against Mr Overend, including one that he ordered a boy from his bed and harangued him for half an hour for taking a packet of crisps from the canteen. An independent but internal inquiry was held into the incident last autumn, after which the abbey said that \"appropriate action\" had been taken, but Mr Overend was not disciplined. Others claim that the headmaster threatened them with legal action over their behaviour during a tour of the United States last autumn. The fact that the headmaster was not previously subject to disciplinary proceedings or written warnings threatens the abbey with more damaging publicity at a possible tribunal for unfair dismissal. The school's doctor, Christopher Besse, is understood to have resigned a fortnight ago after his diagnosis that a number of the children were suffering from stress was questioned by the dean. Only four children were presented at an audition for places earlier this month although up to a dozen new choristers will be required when current pupils leave in the summer. But the dean and governors are bracing themselves for publication of what is expected to be a critical report into the running of the school by Westminster council's social services department within the next fortnight. A draft copy of the report, already sent to the abbey, is said to suggest its management is not appropriate for the 21st century. Although the school's deputy headmistress is taking charge for the time being, the dean was yesterday said to have announced to the school on Saturday night that he was in charge.",

Now Speedo is turning its attentions away from the pool and is relaunching as a leisurewear company. And not before time. The move comes years after sportswear giants Nike, Adidas and Reebok began diversifying into the leisurewear market. Last year Adidas restructured into three divisions, one of them to concentrate solely on lifestyle clothing, after scrapping plans to launch a men's fashion brand. The brand already sells everything from fragrance to toiletries to eyewear. Speedo began life in the land of sun, sea and surf, Australia. In 1928, Sydney-based MacRae Knitting Mills launched Speedo as the brand name for its swimming costumes. The company created a revolutionary design - the 'race-back' style - featuring a high, narrow back panel for the silk and cotton suits. The suits sparked the longest unbroken sponsorship in world sport - between Speedo and the Australian swimming team, beginning at 1948 London Olympics and continuing today. In 1957 Speedo notched up another first - a nylon costume developed in association with Australian freestyle stars Dawn Fraser and Lorraine Crapp. The method is teaming up with the world's swimming elite also continues - many helped develop the Fastskin body suit which propelled Speedo into hot water at the 2000 Olympics. Bad-boy of British swimming Mark Foster had his Olympic accreditation withdrawn after he broke the British Olympic Association rules and wore a Speedo Fastskin suit, reported to improve performance by up to 3%. The incident happened after a six-month row over the Speedo brand appearing on the suits. The British swimming squad were given special permission shortly before the games to wear the suits on the strict condition that the Speedo logo was not visible. Speedo owner Pentland Group controls a stable of brands, including Ellesse, Berghaus, Red or Dead, Mitre, Kickers and holds the exclusive worldwide footwear licence for the LaCoste brand. The company was founded in Liverpool in 1932 by the Rubin family and was first floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1964. It remained a public company for 35 years until November 1999 when it was privatised. It's headquarters remain in the UK. The family still preside over the empire - R Stephen Rubin is chairman and Andrew K Rubin is chief executive. In 1999 its sales were estimated to be around \u00a3675m, showing a growth of approximately 9.7%. It employs 3,200 people in offices in Australia, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Italy, Korea, the Netherlands, Taiwan, Thailand, US and Vietnam. The group's brands are sold in more than 120 countries directly by Pentland Group companies or are represented by licensees and distributors. Related story Feb 26: Speedo moves into leisurewear",

The 73-year-old brand, which is also responsible for some of the most hi-tech competition-wear in the market, is being revamped in a bid to tap the mainstream leisure market. A new brand name has been devised for a range of trendy clothing to be launched next year. However, the Speedo tag will remain emblazoned on the sports-based swimwear. \"We are relaunching to become more of a leisurewear brand. But we will keep the sporting heritage in swimming because that is what Speedo is all about,\" said a company spokeswoman. She said the move into leisurewear would not dilute the brand's sporting heritage. \"We will continue with sporting products but we are bringing leisurewear more to the forefront,\" she added. The technical expertise used to produce Speedo sportswear, such as its controversial bodysuits for swimmers, will be employed in the production of its leisure clothing. Its decision to diversify comes two weeks after the company closed one of its factories in Australia. And it comes years after giant sportswear names including Nike and Adidas extended their ranges to include everything from handbags to spectacles. The leisurewear range will be based initially around clothes to wear to the beach - including t-shirts and shorts - but is likely to extend to a wide range of casual clothing. Speedo's two recently opened stores in London's Covent Garden and Nottingham will stock the new brand, which is also likely to be available in other stores. The range will be promoted by advertising and PR campaigns. Speedo parent company Pentland Group owns a portfolio of apparel and footwear brands, including Ellesse, Berghaus and Kickers.

      "body": "<p>\"As my right honourable friend Baroness Hayman reported on 21 February, the first case of foot and mouth disease in the United Kingdom for 20 years was confirmed on the evening of last Tuesday 20 February in pigs at an abattoir and in cattle on a neighbouring farm near Brentwood in Essex.</p> <p>\"The number of confirmed cases of foot and mouth disease rose to nine this morning. Two further cases, bringing the total to 11, have been confirmed early this afternoon. Today's cases are first, in sheep at Hatherleigh near Okehampton, Devon, at another farm in the same ownership as the one confirmed yesterday; at Bromham, near Chippenham, Wiltshire in sheep at an abattoir which received animals from the Devon source; in a pig farm between the two cases in Northumberland, which is likely to have been windborne spread; and at a sheep and cattle farm near the Welsh border in Herefordshire which had also received sheep from Devon. Infected Area restrictions are being imposed. A decision was taken at lunchtime today to kill the remaining animals on the several premises in Devon under the same ownership, and one neighbouring farm, as dangerous contacts.</p> <p>\"Investigations are continuing into a number of other premises where there is reason to believe there may be disease. The Government's overriding priority is the containment and eradication of this disease.</p> <p>\"On February 21, the United Kingdom government and the European Commission acted swiftly to prohibit temporarily the export of live animals, meat, fresh milk and other animal products from the UK. Given the acutely infectious nature of foot and mouth disease, this was a necessary step in helping to prevent the spread of the disease to other countries. We are able to export non-susceptible animals and their products provided they meet certain conditions and are accompanied by veterinary certificates. Appropriate certificates are now available for issue from MAFF animal health offices.</p> <p>\"We immediately ceased issuing export health certificates for export to third countries for any animals or products which cannot also be exported to other EU member states. This applies whether or not the import conditions for a given country would allow us to export.</p> <p>\"We are urgently tracing all exports of FMD susceptible animals from areas under suspicion to other member states, since February 1 but before the export ban came into effect. The EU commission have been kept informed at every stage, along with our EU partners. I shall be updating the council of agriculture ministers tomorrow. In particular we advised the German authorities of a consignment of sheep from the Devon outbreak and these were slaughtered by the German authorities yesterday.</p> <p>\"Some of the cases have been on premises which are associated with substantial movements of animals. The confirmation of the cases in Northumberland on Friday February 23 showed that the disease was not confined to Essex, and had been in the country longer than had at first been apparent. In these new circumstances, the chief veterinary officer advised that stringent controls were needed. After discussion with the food and farming industries, and with the devolved administrations, I announced later on Friday 23 February that there should be a seven-day standstill of livestock movements throughout Great Britain. This exceptional measure was imposed at 5pm on Friday, and is due to expire at midnight this Friday March 2.</p> <p>\"The department of health and the food standards agency have confirmed that foot and mouth disease has no implications for human health or food. \"The disease causes serious loss of condition, and therefore commercial value, to the main farmed animal species of cattle, pigs and sheep. The presence of disease also blocks our export markets. The disease is highly infectious between animals. It can be transmitted by movements of people and vehicles. Unlike classical swine fever with which we had to deal in East Anglia last year, it is carried through the air.</p> <p>\"Firm control measures had to be taken. The Government is well aware of the disruption the temporary \"controlled area\" in Great Britain has caused to farming, the food chain and the wider rural community.

      "bodyText": "\"As my right honourable friend Baroness Hayman reported on 21 February, the first case of foot and mouth disease in the United Kingdom for 20 years was confirmed on the evening of last Tuesday 20 February in pigs at an abattoir and in cattle on a neighbouring farm near Brentwood in Essex. \"The number of confirmed cases of foot and mouth disease rose to nine this morning. Two further cases, bringing the total to 11, have been confirmed early this afternoon. Today's cases are first, in sheep at Hatherleigh near Okehampton, Devon, at another farm in the same ownership as the one confirmed yesterday; at Bromham, near Chippenham, Wiltshire in sheep at an abattoir which received animals from the Devon source; in a pig farm between the two cases in Northumberland, which is likely to have been windborne spread; and at a sheep and cattle farm near the Welsh border in Herefordshire which had also received sheep from Devon. Infected Area restrictions are being imposed. A decision was taken at lunchtime today to kill the remaining animals on the several premises in Devon under the same ownership, and one neighbouring farm, as dangerous contacts. \"Investigations are continuing into a number of other premises where there is reason to believe there may be disease. The Government's overriding priority is the containment and eradication of this disease. \"On February 21, the United Kingdom government and the European Commission acted swiftly to prohibit temporarily the export of live animals, meat, fresh milk and other animal products from the UK. Given the acutely infectious nature of foot and mouth disease, this was a necessary step in helping to prevent the spread of the disease to other countries. We are able to export non-susceptible animals and their products provided they meet certain conditions and are accompanied by veterinary certificates. Appropriate certificates are now available for issue from MAFF animal health offices. \"We immediately ceased issuing export health certificates for export to third countries for any animals or products which cannot also be exported to other EU member states. This applies whether or not the import conditions for a given country would allow us to export. \"We are urgently tracing all exports of FMD susceptible animals from areas under suspicion to other member states, since February 1 but before the export ban came into effect. The EU commission have been kept informed at every stage, along with our EU partners. I shall be updating the council of agriculture ministers tomorrow. In particular we advised the German authorities of a consignment of sheep from the Devon outbreak and these were slaughtered by the German authorities yesterday. \"Some of the cases have been on premises which are associated with substantial movements of animals. The confirmation of the cases in Northumberland on Friday February 23 showed that the disease was not confined to Essex, and had been in the country longer than had at first been apparent. In these new circumstances, the chief veterinary officer advised that stringent controls were needed. After discussion with the food and farming industries, and with the devolved administrations, I announced later on Friday 23 February that there should be a seven-day standstill of livestock movements throughout Great Britain. This exceptional measure was imposed at 5pm on Friday, and is due to expire at midnight this Friday March 2. \"The department of health and the food standards agency have confirmed that foot and mouth disease has no implications for human health or food. \"The disease causes serious loss of condition, and therefore commercial value, to the main farmed animal species of cattle, pigs and sheep. The presence of disease also blocks our export markets. The disease is highly infectious between animals. It can be transmitted by movements of people and vehicles. Unlike classical swine fever with which we had to deal in East Anglia last year, it is carried through the air. \"Firm control measures had to be taken. The Government is well aware of the disruption the temporary \"controlled area\" in Great Britain has caused to farming, the food chain and the wider rural community. I pay tribute to the responsible approach that the industry and the public are taking. \"During the course of this week, the state veterinary service, under the chief veterinary officer, will continue its huge task of tracing and controlling the disease. They have been assured of all the resources they need for that task. The government is calling on the private veterinary profession and other country's state veterinary services for assistance. \"Baroness Hayman, the minister of state, will be meeting industry representatives tomorrow with the chief veterinary officer. Amongst other matters, they will discuss whether it is possible, consistent with a rigorous approach to the control of disease, to allow for some tightly controlled movement of livestock for slaughter. Consideration is also being given to the temporary closure of footpaths and rights of way. \"We are keeping in the closest touch with the retailers and food producers, to ensure that there should be no serious disruption to food supplies. I am grateful to consumers who have, as I have requested, continued their normal pattern of buying. \"The House will know that the policy of successive governments has been that compensation is paid only for animals which are slaughtered for disease control purposes - in the case of foot and mouth disease, at full market value. foot and mouth disease presents a relatively clear clinical picture. Incubation periods tend to be short. I therefore hope that movement restrictions necessary for disease control will not have to be too protracted. \"The government is determined to eliminate this disease. I, my ministerial team and my department's staff will give this work the highest priority. I welcome the firm support we have received from the industry, from people throughout the country, from our European partners, and from others further afield, in our efforts to do so.\"",

      "bodyText": "The Countryside Alliance march on London next month has been cancelled to prevent the further spread of foot and mouth disease, its organisers said today. Chief executive Richard Burge said a decision had been made to act \"properly and responsibly\" and demonstrate solidarity with the farming community. More cases of foot and mouth disease were confirmed today, bringing the total to 12 so far, as the mass incineration of thousands of animal carcasses continued. \"Large sections of the rural community are finding themselves unable to come on the march,\" Mr Burge said. \"They have a major crisis to resolve and that is where they need to be, not tramping the streets of London.\" Ministry of agriculture officials confirmed outbreaks of the highly contagious disease in Bromham, Wiltshire and at a farm in Hatherleigh, Devon. Both cases were related to an outbreak at Burdon farm, Highampton, Devon, a spokesman said. The south-west outbreak is the first to affect sheep. Three more farms - a pig farm in Northumberland, a sheep and cattle farm in Herefordshire and another in Devon - were also confirmed to be infected. The outbreak at Burdon farm has sparked fears that the disease may have spread to Europe. The sheep and cattle farm is part of a chain of 13 in Devon and Cornwall owned by a sheep dealer who exports animals to Europe. The European commission has been warned that infected animals could have been sold abroad but it is not known how long the disease has been spreading at the Devon farm or when sheep were last exported to Europe. In a statement to the Commons today Agriculture minister Nick Brown said the government was urgently tracing all exports of susceptible animals from suspect areas to EU member states. The latest cases have dashed hopes that the disease had been contained by slaughtering and a seven-day ban on livestock movement. Farming leaders called it a \"nightmare scenario\" and the National Farmers' Union south-west regional director, Anthony Gibson, said he feared the latest outbreak could be even worse than the one in 1967, when more than 400,000 animals were slaughtered. Until the weekend, confirmed outbreaks of the disease had been confined to two clusters in Northumberland and Essex. Animal carcasses were today burning in the infected areas. More than 2,000 pigs, sheep and cattle have so far been culled nationwide. Talk about it What do you think? Related special reports Special report: what's wrong with our food?

The Labour MP for Chesterfield lashed out at the party's attempts to control the media. \"I receive a personalised fax from Labour HQ every morning saying 'Mr Benn welcomes compulsory homework for pensioners', or whatever the latest gimmick is, and I'm expected to fax it on to my local paper,\" said Mr Benn in an interview with the Radio Times. \"You're like an Avon lady being told what to say when you knock at the front door,\" he added. Mr Benn said the personalised faxes had stopped recently. But he added that the control was \"destructive of the political process and led to people switching off\". He added that modern politics was \"all marketing, show business and advertising\" and said viewers received a distorted view of politics because coverage was so personality-based. Mr Benn also criticised the BBC, saying: \"It's broadly true that the BBC doesn't seem to want any debate on Europe.\" He said he was depressed by TV's obsession with personalities, saying it was bad for democracy. \"The coverage has changed.

He noted that he believed himself to have been invited and then \"uninvited\" to participate in a discussion programme because of pressure from the Labour party. In the interview, Mr Benn also revealed that he was \"completely taken in\" in his interview with Ali G. The MP lost his temper with the comedian, believing him to be an example of idiot \"yoof\" TV at its worst. \"It's a very clever political programme,\" he said. \"It helps viewers see the nonsense of the prejudice they read in the tabloids.\" Related story Feb 23: Labour joins text message frenzy",

This is when the biggest free trade summit since the protesters overran the World Trade Organisation talks in Seattle last December will be held in Quebec City.

      "body": "<p>Supermarkets, independent butchers, and processed food manufacturers were preparing contingency plans over the weekend to switch from British to imported supplies of pork, lamb and beef, but panic buying failed to materialise.</p> <p>They said there was enough British meat in the supply chain to cover the current ban on the movement of livestock, if consumers stick to normal patterns of buying.</p> <p>Supermarkets reported adequate stocks, with the exception of a few areas where people appeared to have responded to reports in some newspapers about the possibility of shortages.</p> <p>Sainsbury's said its buyers had checked branches across the country and found that people were buying as normal. Panic buying might make \"a good story, but it's not true from what we've seen\", said a spokeswoman, Mandy Percy.</p> <p>Sales of red meat have been flat for some time. The season for British new lamb is coming to an end and new season lamb would start coming from New Zealand over the next couple of months even if there were no foot and mouth crisis.</p> <p>Sainsbury's were confident of continuity of supply. \"There is still plenty of beef, and extra pork will come from Northern Ireland. These are supply chains that already exist,\" said Ms Percy. Sainsbury's was not expecting any changes in prices.</p> <p>Asda and Tesco said it was business as usual with no evidence of panic buying. \"We're 100% confident we've got supplies to keep everything as normal,\" said Zaria Pinchbeck, spokeswoman for Asda. The company buys all its meat in the UK but said switching to foreign suppliers presented no difficulties. It had also ordered 200,000 frozen turkeys in case of a sudden surge in demand.</p> <p>Ready meals and processed foods such as meat pies depend largely on meat from the UK.

      "bodyText": "Supermarkets, independent butchers, and processed food manufacturers were preparing contingency plans over the weekend to switch from British to imported supplies of pork, lamb and beef, but panic buying failed to materialise. They said there was enough British meat in the supply chain to cover the current ban on the movement of livestock, if consumers stick to normal patterns of buying. Supermarkets reported adequate stocks, with the exception of a few areas where people appeared to have responded to reports in some newspapers about the possibility of shortages. Sainsbury's said its buyers had checked branches across the country and found that people were buying as normal. Panic buying might make \"a good story, but it's not true from what we've seen\", said a spokeswoman, Mandy Percy. Sales of red meat have been flat for some time. The season for British new lamb is coming to an end and new season lamb would start coming from New Zealand over the next couple of months even if there were no foot and mouth crisis. Sainsbury's were confident of continuity of supply. \"There is still plenty of beef, and extra pork will come from Northern Ireland. These are supply chains that already exist,\" said Ms Percy. Sainsbury's was not expecting any changes in prices. Asda and Tesco said it was business as usual with no evidence of panic buying. \"We're 100% confident we've got supplies to keep everything as normal,\" said Zaria Pinchbeck, spokeswoman for Asda. The company buys all its meat in the UK but said switching to foreign suppliers presented no difficulties. It had also ordered 200,000 frozen turkeys in case of a sudden surge in demand. Ready meals and processed foods such as meat pies depend largely on meat from the UK. Supplies would be disrupted by the end of the week unless manufacturers started sourcing meat from overseas, but the food chain was very flexible, according to a spokesman for the Food and Drink Manufacturing Federation. Consumers appeared to have taken on board government reassurances that there was no need for panic and that foot and mouth disease represented no risk to human health. The food standards agency said it was possible that some infected meat might have gone on sale in the few weeks before the first case was confirmed but that eating infected meat posed no risk to people. Leftover food should not be fed to pets, however. Despite reports from the supermarkets and independent retailers' associations that people were shopping as usual, some of the tabloid papers ran stories about a widespread rush to stock up. \"Britain was gripped by panic buying yesterday, amid fears of looming meat shortages,\" the Sunday Mirror said. \"Sales of fresh meat soared yesterday as shoppers rushed to fill their baskets fearing the foot and mouth outbreak will cause shortages,\" according to the Sunday Express. The Daily Mail and the Daily Express led their front pages on Saturday with the idea that there might be shortages. A few instances of panic buying were reported. Waitrose said that at one branch in Henleaze, Birmingham, there had been a 50% increase in demand for fresh meat. Kwik Save in Stirchley, Birmingham, sold out of frozen meat by lunchtime on Saturday. But Asda said its customer service hotline was very quiet. Retailers were watching in case the prophecies of scarcity became self-fulfilling as they had done in the fuel crisis last autumn, but felt the picture this weekend looked different. \"In the petrol crisis people did panic buy food, but it was staples, like bread and milk, not meat,\" Ms Pinchbeck said.

The balancing act, during a visit that lasted less than 24 hours, came amid reports that the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, and the prime minister-elect, Ariel Sharon, had opened up \"channels of communication\". By the time Mr Powell landed in Amman, Jordan, yesterday afternoon on the next leg of a whistle-stop tour of the region, both Israel and the Palestinians were claiming to have made their case with the new US administration. But the precarious situation Mr Powell left behind asserted itself almost immediately when Palestinian gunmen pumped 20 bullets into a car driven by a Jewish settler north of Ramallah, wounding the motorist. An Israeli woman motorist, also from the Jewish settlement of Ateret, was shot in a separate attack. Minutes earlier, Mr Powell had told a press conference with Mr Arafat in Ramallah that both sides must move away from violence, and that Israel must lift its siege of the West Bank and Gaza as soon as possible. \"It places great hardship on Palestinian families, and does nothing to quiet the security situation in the region,\" Mr Powell said. Diplomats say Mr Powell's focus on Israel's punitive blockade of the West Bank and Gaza is meant to stop the hardline Mr Sharon from enacting even harsher measures against the Palestinians once he forms a government. In diplomatic circles there is growing concern about the economic hardships of ordinary Palestinians, and the precarious financial state of Mr Arafat's administration. Mr Powell tempered his comments by sympathising with complaints about attacks on Israeli soldiers and Jewish settlers. In Jerusalem,after a meeting with Mr Sharon, Mr Powell said he was disturbed by Israeli army predictions that the five-month uprising, which has claimed more than 400 lives, would continue to escalate. Mr Powell said: \"We all have to work hard... to bring the violence under control, to get out of this terrible spiral of increasing violence, where we have violence, counter-violence, provocation, counter-provocation. It is time for all leaders in the region to do everything possible to control passions.\" The statement was welcome news to Mr Sharon who refuses to end a blockade of Palestinian areas that has stopped more than 100,000 day workers going to their jobs in Israel, or to release some \u00a337m in tax revenues owed to the Palestinians until Mr Arafat reins in the field commanders of the uprising. \"The Palestinian Authority must take immediate action to stop terror and violence,\" Mr Sharon said. \"I will conduct negotiations with the Palestinian Authority following the cessation of hostilities.

The other parties can't keep pretending that you can cut taxes without cutting public services.\" The party \u0096 which is in coalition alliance with Labour in both the Scottish parliament and the Welsh assembly \u0096 wants to provide an extra 3,300 training places for doctors and an additional 11,400 for nurses and midwives of five years. Mr Kennedy also pledged to restore free NHS eye and dental check-ups for all, providing 11,000 extra hospital beds over five years to cut waiting times and paying for all long-term personal care for the elderly. This plan has already been agreed in Edinburgh for Scottish pensioners after the Scottish Lib Dem leader, Jim Wallace, gave Labour an ultimatum. The revenue garnered from the new top rate of income tax would also pay for a \u00a3500m investment in dental services. In a bid to head off criticism of being the only party advocating tax increases, the Lib Dems will also propose an annual \"tax contract\" with the British people, promising to spell out exactly what public money is spent on, and how any changes have affected income tax payers. The contract would be posted to every household in the UK. The Liberal Democrat treasury spokesman, Matthew Taylor, said the contract would make the Lib Dems the first party to forego the option of \"stealth taxes\", which he said boosted the total tax-take but went largely unnoticed by voters because they did not affect income tax. The proposals come amid a flurry of big policy announcements from all the major parties, stoking up the prospect of an early April election in the wake of Gordon Brown's budget on March 7.",

      "body": "<p><a href=\"http://books.theguardian.com/extracts/story/0,6761,443407,00.html\">Part one: Why has he got away with it?</a></p> <p>In Years of Upheaval, the second volume of his trilogy of memoirs, Henry Kissinger found the subject of the 1974 Cyprus catastrophe so awkward that he decided to postpone consideration of it: \"I must leave a full discussion of the Cyprus episode to another occasion, for it stretched into the Ford presidency and its legacy exists unresolved today.\" </p> <p>In most of his writing about himself, Kissinger projects a strong impression of a man at home in the world and on top of his brief. But there are a number of occasions when it suits him to pose as a sort of Candide: naive, ill- prepared for and easily unhorsed by events. No doubt this pose costs him some self-esteem. It is a pose, furthermore, which he often adopts at precisely the time when the record shows him to be knowledgeable, and when knowledge or foreknowledge would confront him with charges of responsibility or complicity. </p> <p>Kissinger now argues, in the long-delayed third volume of his memoirs, Years of Renewal, that he was prevented and distracted, by Watergate and the meltdown of the Nixon presidency, from taking an interest in the crucial triangle of force between Greece, Turkey and Cyprus. This is a bizarre disclaimer: the proximity of Cyprus to the Middle East was a factor never absent from US strategic thinking, and there was no reason of domestic policy to prevent the region from engaging his attention. Furthermore, the very implosion of Nixonian authority, cited as a reason for Kissinger's absence of mind, in fact bestowed extraordinary powers upon him. </p> <p>When he became secretary of state in 1973, Kissinger took care to retain his post as special assistant to the president for national security affairs, or national security adviser. This made him the first and only secretary of state to hold the chairmanship of the elite and secretive Forty Committee, which considered and approved covert actions by the CIA. Mean while, as chairman of the National Security Council, he held a position where every important intelligence plan passed across his desk. His former NSC aide, Roger Morris, was not exaggerating by much, if at all, when he said that Kissinger's dual position, plus Nixon's eroded status, made him \"no less than acting chief of state for national security\". </p> <p>Kissinger gives one hostage to fortune in Years of Upheaval and another in Years of Renewal. In the former, he says plainly: \"I had always taken it for granted that the next intercommunal crisis in Cyprus would provoke Turkish intervention.\" That is, it would at least risk the prospect of a war within Nato between Greece and Turkey, and would certainly involve the partition of the island. That this was common knowledge may not be doubted by any person even lightly acquainted with Cypriot affairs. In the latter volume, Kissinger repeatedly asks the reader why anyone (such as himself, so burdened with Watergate) would have sought \"a crisis in the eastern Mediterranean between two Nato allies\". </p> <p>These two disingenuous statements need to be qualified in the light of a third, which appears on page 199 of Years of Renewal. Here, President Makarios of Cyprus is described without adornment as \"the proximate cause of most of Cyprus's tensions\". Makarios was the democratically elected leader of a virtually unarmed republic. His rule was challenged, and the independence of Cyprus was threatened, by a military dictatorship in Athens and a highly militarised government in Turkey, both of which sponsored rightwing gangster organisations on the island, and both of which had plans to annex the greater or lesser part of it. Several attempts had been made on Makarios's life. To describe him as \"the proximate cause\" of the tensions is to make a wildly aberrant moral judgment. </p> <p>This same judgment, however, supplies the key that unlocks the lie at the heart of Kissinger's presentation. If the elected civilian authority (and spiritual leader of the Greek Orthodox community) is the \"proximate cause\" of the tensions, then his removal from the scene is self-evidently the cure for them. If one can demonstrate that there was such a removal plan, and that Kissinger knew about it in advance, then it follows logically that he was not ostensibly looking for a crisis - as he self-pityingly asks us to disbelieve - but for a solution. The fact that he got a crisis, which was also a hideous calamity for the region, does not change the equation. It is attributable to the other observable fact that the scheme to remove Makarios, on which the \"solution\" depended, was in practice a failure. But those who willed the means and wished the ends are not absolved from guilt by the refusal of reality to match their schemes. </p> <p>It is, from Kissinger's own record, as well as from the record of the subsequent official inquiry, easy to demonstrate that he did have advance knowledge of the plan to depose Makarios. He admits as much himself, by noting that the Greek dictator Dimitrios Ioannides, head of the secret police, was determined to mount a coup in Cyprus and bring the island under the control of Athens. This was one of the better-known facts of the situation, as was the more embarrassing fact that Brigadier Ioannides was dependent on US military aid and political sympathy. His police state had been expelled from the Council of Europe and blocked from joining the EEC, and it was largely the advantage conferred by his agreement to \"home port\" the US Sixth Fleet, and host a string of US air and intelligence bases, that kept him in power. This policy was highly controversial in Congress and in the American press, and the argument over it was part of Kissinger's daily bread long before Watergate. </p> <p>Thus it was understood in general that the Greek dictatorship, a US client, wished to see Makarios overthrown and had already tried to have him killed. (Overthrow and assassination, incidentally, are effectively coterminous in this account; there was no possibility of leaving such a charismatic leader alive, and those who sought his removal invariably intended his death.) This was also understood in particular . The most salient proof is this. In May 1974, two months before the coup in Nicosia, which Kissinger later claimed was a shock, he received a memorandum from the head of his state department Cyprus desk, Thomas Boyatt. Boyatt summarised the reasons for believing that a Greek junta attack on Cyprus was imminent. He further argued that, in the absence of a US representation to Athens, warning the dictators to desist, it might be assumed that the United States was indifferent to this. And he added what everybody knew - that such a coup, if it went forward, would beyond doubt trigger a Turkish invasion. </p> <p>Prescient memos are a dime a dozen in Washington after a crisis; they are often then read for the first time, or leaked to the press or Congress. But Kissinger now admits that he saw this document in real time, while engaged in his shuttle between Syria and Israel (both of them within half an hour's flying time of Cyprus). Yet no d\u00e9marche bearing his name or carrying his authority was issued to the Greek junta. </p> <p>A short while afterwards, Kissinger received a call from Senator J William Fulbright, the chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee. Senator Fulbright had been briefed about the impending coup by a senior Greek dissident journalist in Washington named Elias P Demetracopoulos. He told Kissinger that steps should be taken to avert the planned Greek action, and he gave three reasons. The first was that it would repair some of the moral damage done by the US governments indulgence of the junta. The second was that it would head off a confrontation between Greece and Turkey in the Mediterranean. The third was that it would enhance US prestige on the island. Kissinger declined to take the recommended steps, on the bizarre grounds that he could not intervene in Greek \"internal affairs\" at a time when the Nixon administration was resisting pressure from Senator Henry Jackson to link US-Soviet trade to the free emigration of Russian Jewry. However odd this line of argument, it still makes it impossible for Kissinger to claim, as he still does, that he had had no warn ing. </p> <p>So there was still no high-level US concern registered with Athens. The difficulty is sometimes presented as one of protocol or etiquette, as if Kissinger's regular custom was to whisper and tread lightly. But again I remind you that Henry Kissinger, in addition to his formal diplomatic eminence, was also head of the Forty Committee, and supervisor of covert action, and was dealing in private with an Athens regime that had long-standing CIA ties. Boyatt's memoranda, warning of what was to happen, were classified as secret and have still never been released. Asked to testify to a Congressional hearing, he was at first forbidden by Kissinger to appear. He was only finally permitted to do so in order that he might avoid a citation for contempt. His evidence was taken in \"executive session\", with the hearing room cleared of staff, reporters and visitors. </p> <p>Events continued to gather pace. On July 1 1974, three senior officials of the Greek foreign ministry, all known for their moderate views on the Cyprus question, publicly tendered their resignations. On July 3, President Makarios made public an open letter to the Greek junta, which made the direct accusation of foreign interference and subversion. He called for the withdrawal from Cyprus of the officers responsible. </p> <p>Some days after the coup, which eventually occurred on July 15 1974, when challenged at a press conference about his apparent failure to foresee or avert it, Kissinger replied that \"the information was not lying around in the streets\". Actually, it almost was in the streets. But more importantly, it had been available to him round the clock, in both his diplomatic and his intelligence capacities. His decision to do nothing was therefore a direct decision to do something, or to let something be done. </p> <p>To the rest of the world, two things were obvious about the coup. The first was that it had been instigated from Athens and carried out with the help of regular Greek forces, and was thus a direct intervention in the internal affairs of one country by another. The second was that it violated all the existing treaties governing the status of Cyprus. The obvious and unsavoury illegality was luridly emphasised by the junta itself, which chose a notorious chauvinist gunman named Nicos Sampson to be its proxy \"president\". Sampson must have been well known to the chairman of the Forty Committee as a long-standing recipient of financial support from the CIA; he also received money for his fanatical Nicosia newspaper Makhi (Combat) from a pro-junta CIA proxy in Athens, Savvas Constantopoulos, the publisher of the pro-junta organ Eleftheros Kosmos (Free World). No European government treated Sampson as anything but a pariah, for the brief nine days in which he held power and launched a campaign of murder against his democratic Greek opponents. But Kissinger told the US envoy in Nicosia to receive Sampson's \"foreign minister\" as foreign minister, thus making the United States the first and only government to extend de facto recognition. (At this point, it might be emphasised, the whereabouts of Makarios were unknown. His palace had been shelled and his death announced on the junta's radio. He had in fact made his escape, and was able to broadcast the fact a few days afterwards - to the irritation of certain well-placed persons.) In his 1986 memoir The Truth, published in Athens in 1986, the then head of the Greek armed forces, General Grigorios Bonanos, records that the junta's attack on Cyprus brought a message of approval and support, delivered to its intelligence service by no less a man than Thomas A Pappas - the chosen intermediary between the junta and the Nixon-Kissinger administration. </p> <p>In Washington, Kissinger's press spokesman Robert Anderson flatly denied that the coup - later described by Makarios from the podium of the United Nations as \"an invasion\" - constituted foreign intervention. \"No,\" he replied to a direct question on this point. \"In our view there has been no outside intervention.\" This surreal position was not contradicted by Kissinger when he met with the ambassador of Cyprus and failed to offer the customary condolences on the reported death of his president - the \"proximate cause\", we now learn from him, of all the unpleasantness. When asked if he still recognised the elected Makarios government as the legal one, Kissinger doggedly and astonishingly refused to answer. When asked if the United States was moving towards recognition of the Sampson regime, his spokesman declined to deny it. When Makarios came to Washington on July 22, the state department was asked whether he would be received by Kissinger \"as a private citizen, as Archbishop, or as President of Cyprus?\" The answer? \"He [Kissinger] is meeting with Archbishop Makarios on Monday.\" Every other government in the world, save the collapsing Greek dictatorship, recognised Makarios as the legitimate head of the Cyprus republic. Kissinger's unilateralism on the point is without diplomatic precedent, and argues strongly for his collusion and sympathy with the armed handful of thugs who felt the same way. </p> <p>It is worth emphasising that Makarios was invited to Washington in the first place, as elected and legal president of Cyprus, by Senator J William Fulbright of the Senate foreign relations committee, and by his counterpart Congressman Thomas Morgan, chairman of the house foreign affairs committee. Credit for this invitation belongs to Elias Demetracopoulos, the Washington-based dissident journalist, who had long warned of the coup. He it was who conveyed the invitation to Makarios, who was then in London meeting the British foreign secretary. This initiative crowned a series of anti-junta activities by this journalist, who had already profoundly irritated Kissinger and become a special object of his spite. At the very last moment, and with very poor grace, Kissinger was compelled to announce that he was receiving Makarios in his presidential and not his episcopal capacity. </p> <p>Since Kissinger himself tells us that he had always known or assumed that another outbreak of violence in Cyprus would trigger a Turkish military intervention, we can assume in our turn that he was not surprised when such an intervention came. Nor does he seem to have been very much disconcerted. While the Greek junta remained in power, his efforts were principally directed to shielding it from retaliation. He was opposed to the return of Makarios to the island, and strongly opposed to Turkish or British use of force (Britain being a guarantor power with a treaty obligation and troops in place on Cyprus) to undo the Greek coup. This same counsel of inertia or inaction - amply testified to in his own memoirs - translated later into strict and repeated admonitions against any measures to block a Turkish invasion. Sir Tom McNally, then the chief political adviser to Britain's then foreign secretary and future prime minister, James Callaghan, has since disclosed that Kissinger \"vetoed\" at least one British military action to pre-empt a Turkish landing. </p> <p>This may seem paradoxical, but the long-standing sympathy for a partition of Cyprus, repeatedly expressed by the state and defence departments, makes it seem much less so. The demographic composition of the island (82% Greek to 18% Turkish) made it more logical for the partition to be imposed by Greece. But a second-best was to have it imposed by Turkey. And, once Turkey had conducted two brutal invasions and occupied almost 40% of Cypriot territory, Kissinger exerted himself very strongly to protect Ankara from any congressional reprisal for this outright violation of international law, and promiscuous and illegal misuse of US weaponry. He became so pro-Turkish, indeed, that it was as if he had never heard of the Greek colonels. (Though his expressed dislike of the returned Greek democratic leaders supplied an occasional reminder.) </p> <p>Not all the elements of this partitionist policy can be charged to Kissinger personally; he inherited the Greek junta and the official dislike of Makarios. However, even in the dank obfuscatory prose of his own memoirs, he does admit what can otherwise be concluded from independent sources. Using covert channels, and short-circuiting the democratic process in his own country, he made himself an accomplice in a plan of political assassination which, when it went awry, led to the deaths of thousands of civilians, the violent uprooting of almost 200,000 refugees, and the creation of an unjust and unstable amputation of Cyprus which constitutes a serious threat to peace a full quarter-century later. On July 10 1976, the European Commission on Human Rights adopted a report, prepared by 18 distinguished jurists and chaired by Professor JES Fawcett, resulting from a year's research into the consequences of the Turkish invasion. It found that the Turkish army had engaged in the deliberate killing of civilians, in the execution of prisoners, in the torture and ill-treatment of detainees, in the arbitrary punishment and detention of civilians, and in systematic acts of rape, torture, and looting. A large number of \"disappeared\" persons, both prisoners of war and civilians, are still \"missing\" from this period. They include a dozen holders of US passports, which is evidence in itself of an indiscriminate strategy, when conducted by an army dependent on US aid and mat\u00e9riel. </p> <p>Perhaps it was a reluctance to accept his responsibility for these outrages, as well as his responsibility for the original coup, that led Kissinger to tell a bizarre sequence of lies to his new friends the Chinese. On October 2 1974, he held a high-level meeting in New York with Qiao Guanhua, vice-foreign minister of the People's Republic. It was the first substantive Sino-American meeting since the visit of Deng Xiaoping, and the first order of business was Cyprus. The memorandum, which is headed \"Top secret/sensitive/exclusively eyes only\", has Kissinger first rejecting China's public claim that he had helped engineer the removal of Makarios. \"We did not. We did not oppose Makarios.\" (This claim is directly belied by his own memoirs.) He says: \"When the coup occurred I was in Moscow\", which he was not. He says: \"My people did not take these intelligence reports [concerning an impending coup] seriously,\" even though they had. He says that neither did Makarios take them seriously, even though Makarios had publicly denounced the Athens junta for its coup plans. Kissinger then makes the amazing claim: \"We knew the Soviets had told the Turks to invade\", which would make this the first Soviet-instigated invasion to be conducted by a Nato army and paid for with US aid. </p> <p>A good liar must have a good memory: Kissinger is a stupendous liar with a remarkable memory. So perhaps some of this hysterical lying is explained by its context - by the need to enlist China's anti-Soviet instincts. But the total of falsity is so impressive that it suggests something additional, something more like denial or delusion, or even a confession by other means. </p> <p>\u0095 Extracted from The Trial of Henry Kissinger by Christopher Hitchens, to be published by Verso, price \u00a315, in May. \u00a9 Christopher Hitchens.</p>",

But Kissinger now admits that he saw this document in real time, while engaged in his shuttle between Syria and Israel (both of them within half an hour's flying time of Cyprus). Yet no d\u00e9marche bearing his name or carrying his authority was issued to the Greek junta. A short while afterwards, Kissinger received a call from Senator J William Fulbright, the chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee. Senator Fulbright had been briefed about the impending coup by a senior Greek dissident journalist in Washington named Elias P Demetracopoulos. He told Kissinger that steps should be taken to avert the planned Greek action, and he gave three reasons. The first was that it would repair some of the moral damage done by the US governments indulgence of the junta. The second was that it would head off a confrontation between Greece and Turkey in the Mediterranean. The third was that it would enhance US prestige on the island. Kissinger declined to take the recommended steps, on the bizarre grounds that he could not intervene in Greek \"internal affairs\" at a time when the Nixon administration was resisting pressure from Senator Henry Jackson to link US-Soviet trade to the free emigration of Russian Jewry. However odd this line of argument, it still makes it impossible for Kissinger to claim, as he still does, that he had had no warn ing. So there was still no high-level US concern registered with Athens. The difficulty is sometimes presented as one of protocol or etiquette, as if Kissinger's regular custom was to whisper and tread lightly. But again I remind you that Henry Kissinger, in addition to his formal diplomatic eminence, was also head of the Forty Committee, and supervisor of covert action, and was dealing in private with an Athens regime that had long-standing CIA ties. Boyatt's memoranda, warning of what was to happen, were classified as secret and have still never been released. Asked to testify to a Congressional hearing, he was at first forbidden by Kissinger to appear. He was only finally permitted to do so in order that he might avoid a citation for contempt. His evidence was taken in \"executive session\", with the hearing room cleared of staff, reporters and visitors. Events continued to gather pace. On July 1 1974, three senior officials of the Greek foreign ministry, all known for their moderate views on the Cyprus question, publicly tendered their resignations. On July 3, President Makarios made public an open letter to the Greek junta, which made the direct accusation of foreign interference and subversion. He called for the withdrawal from Cyprus of the officers responsible. Some days after the coup, which eventually occurred on July 15 1974, when challenged at a press conference about his apparent failure to foresee or avert it, Kissinger replied that \"the information was not lying around in the streets\". Actually, it almost was in the streets. But more importantly, it had been available to him round the clock, in both his diplomatic and his intelligence capacities. His decision to do nothing was therefore a direct decision to do something, or to let something be done. To the rest of the world, two things were obvious about the coup. The first was that it had been instigated from Athens and carried out with the help of regular Greek forces, and was thus a direct intervention in the internal affairs of one country by another. The second was that it violated all the existing treaties governing the status of Cyprus. The obvious and unsavoury illegality was luridly emphasised by the junta itself, which chose a notorious chauvinist gunman named Nicos Sampson to be its proxy \"president\". Sampson must have been well known to the chairman of the Forty Committee as a long-standing recipient of financial support from the CIA; he also received money for his fanatical Nicosia newspaper Makhi (Combat) from a pro-junta CIA proxy in Athens, Savvas Constantopoulos, the publisher of the pro-junta organ Eleftheros Kosmos (Free World). No European government treated Sampson as anything but a pariah, for the brief nine days in which he held power and launched a campaign of murder against his democratic Greek opponents. But Kissinger told the US envoy in Nicosia to receive Sampson's \"foreign minister\" as foreign minister, thus making the United States the first and only government to extend de facto recognition. (At this point, it might be emphasised, the whereabouts of Makarios were unknown. His palace had been shelled and his death announced on the junta's radio. He had in fact made his escape, and was able to broadcast the fact a few days afterwards - to the irritation of certain well-placed persons.) In his 1986 memoir The Truth, published in Athens in 1986, the then head of the Greek armed forces, General Grigorios Bonanos, records that the junta's attack on Cyprus brought a message of approval and support, delivered to its intelligence service by no less a man than Thomas A Pappas - the chosen intermediary between the junta and the Nixon-Kissinger administration. In Washington, Kissinger's press spokesman Robert Anderson flatly denied that the coup - later described by Makarios from the podium of the United Nations as \"an invasion\" - constituted foreign intervention. \"No,\" he replied to a direct question on this point. \"In our view there has been no outside intervention.\" This surreal position was not contradicted by Kissinger when he met with the ambassador of Cyprus and failed to offer the customary condolences on the reported death of his president - the \"proximate cause\", we now learn from him, of all the unpleasantness. When asked if he still recognised the elected Makarios government as the legal one, Kissinger doggedly and astonishingly refused to answer. When asked if the United States was moving towards recognition of the Sampson regime, his spokesman declined to deny it. When Makarios came to Washington on July 22, the state department was asked whether he would be received by Kissinger \"as a private citizen, as Archbishop, or as President of Cyprus?\" The answer? \"He [Kissinger] is meeting with Archbishop Makarios on Monday.\" Every other government in the world, save the collapsing Greek dictatorship, recognised Makarios as the legitimate head of the Cyprus republic. Kissinger's unilateralism on the point is without diplomatic precedent, and argues strongly for his collusion and sympathy with the armed handful of thugs who felt the same way. It is worth emphasising that Makarios was invited to Washington in the first place, as elected and legal president of Cyprus, by Senator J William Fulbright of the Senate foreign relations committee, and by his counterpart Congressman Thomas Morgan, chairman of the house foreign affairs committee. Credit for this invitation belongs to Elias Demetracopoulos, the Washington-based dissident journalist, who had long warned of the coup. He it was who conveyed the invitation to Makarios, who was then in London meeting the British foreign secretary. This initiative crowned a series of anti-junta activities by this journalist, who had already profoundly irritated Kissinger and become a special object of his spite. At the very last moment, and with very poor grace, Kissinger was compelled to announce that he was receiving Makarios in his presidential and not his episcopal capacity. Since Kissinger himself tells us that he had always known or assumed that another outbreak of violence in Cyprus would trigger a Turkish military intervention, we can assume in our turn that he was not surprised when such an intervention came. Nor does he seem to have been very much disconcerted. While the Greek junta remained in power, his efforts were principally directed to shielding it from retaliation. He was opposed to the return of Makarios to the island, and strongly opposed to Turkish or British use of force (Britain being a guarantor power with a treaty obligation and troops in place on Cyprus) to undo the Greek coup. This same counsel of inertia or inaction - amply testified to in his own memoirs - translated later into strict and repeated admonitions against any measures to block a Turkish invasion. Sir Tom McNally, then the chief political adviser to Britain's then foreign secretary and future prime minister, James Callaghan, has since disclosed that Kissinger \"vetoed\" at least one British military action to pre-empt a Turkish landing. This may seem paradoxical, but the long-standing sympathy for a partition of Cyprus, repeatedly expressed by the state and defence departments, makes it seem much less so. The demographic composition of the island (82% Greek to 18% Turkish) made it more logical for the partition to be imposed by Greece. But a second-best was to have it imposed by Turkey. And, once Turkey had conducted two brutal invasions and occupied almost 40% of Cypriot territory, Kissinger exerted himself very strongly to protect Ankara from any congressional reprisal for this outright violation of international law, and promiscuous and illegal misuse of US weaponry. He became so pro-Turkish, indeed, that it was as if he had never heard of the Greek colonels. (Though his expressed dislike of the returned Greek democratic leaders supplied an occasional reminder.) Not all the elements of this partitionist policy can be charged to Kissinger personally; he inherited the Greek junta and the official dislike of Makarios. However, even in the dank obfuscatory prose of his own memoirs, he does admit what can otherwise be concluded from independent sources. Using covert channels, and short-circuiting the democratic process in his own country, he made himself an accomplice in a plan of political assassination which, when it went awry, led to the deaths of thousands of civilians, the violent uprooting of almost 200,000 refugees, and the creation of an unjust and unstable amputation of Cyprus which constitutes a serious threat to peace a full quarter-century later. On July 10 1976, the European Commission on Human Rights adopted a report, prepared by 18 distinguished jurists and chaired by Professor JES Fawcett, resulting from a year's research into the consequences of the Turkish invasion. It found that the Turkish army had engaged in the deliberate killing of civilians, in the execution of prisoners, in the torture and ill-treatment of detainees, in the arbitrary punishment and detention of civilians, and in systematic acts of rape, torture, and looting. A large number of \"disappeared\" persons, both prisoners of war and civilians, are still \"missing\" from this period. They include a dozen holders of US passports, which is evidence in itself of an indiscriminate strategy, when conducted by an army dependent on US aid and mat\u00e9riel. Perhaps it was a reluctance to accept his responsibility for these outrages, as well as his responsibility for the original coup, that led Kissinger to tell a bizarre sequence of lies to his new friends the Chinese. On October 2 1974, he held a high-level meeting in New York with Qiao Guanhua, vice-foreign minister of the People's Republic. It was the first substantive Sino-American meeting since the visit of Deng Xiaoping, and the first order of business was Cyprus. The memorandum, which is headed \"Top secret/sensitive/exclusively eyes only\", has Kissinger first rejecting China's public claim that he had helped engineer the removal of Makarios. \"We did not. We did not oppose Makarios.\" (This claim is directly belied by his own memoirs.) He says: \"When the coup occurred I was in Moscow\", which he was not. He says: \"My people did not take these intelligence reports [concerning an impending coup] seriously,\" even though they had. He says that neither did Makarios take them seriously, even though Makarios had publicly denounced the Athens junta for its coup plans. Kissinger then makes the amazing claim: \"We knew the Soviets had told the Turks to invade\", which would make this the first Soviet-instigated invasion to be conducted by a Nato army and paid for with US aid. A good liar must have a good memory: Kissinger is a stupendous liar with a remarkable memory. So perhaps some of this hysterical lying is explained by its context - by the need to enlist China's anti-Soviet instincts. But the total of falsity is so impressive that it suggests something additional, something more like denial or delusion, or even a confession by other means. \u0095 Extracted from The Trial of Henry Kissinger by Christopher Hitchens, to be published by Verso, price \u00a315, in May. \u00a9 Christopher Hitchens.",

Barry George, 40, was led into the dock of the Old Bailey's maximum security Court Number One in front of a packed public gallery and about 50 reporters. The man who was to marry Dando, gynaecologist Alan Farthing, and her fellow BBC Crimewatch presenter Nick Ross were among those at the court. Mr George, of Fulham, west London, stood briefly to confirm his name. He is charged with murdering 37-year-old Dando on the doorstep of her home in Fulham on April 26, 1999. Mr George - who calls himself Barry Bulsara in tribute to dead singer Freddie Mercury, whose real name it was - appeared in court last month to plead not guilty to the charge. Michael Mansfield QC, is defending Mr George at the trial, which is expected to last up to six weeks. Dando's murder sparked a public outpouring of grief, with condolence messages flooding into the BBC. The corporation received 9,400 emails in the 30 hours after her murder. In her career at the BBC, Dando had presented news programmes and was best known for hosting the shows Holiday and Crimewatch.

Broadcasting union Bectu, which launched the industrial action this morning over new expenses rules, is expecting BBC managers to book double the usual number of camera crews to cover for staff returning to base for lunch. As part of the work to rule, Bectu members will be returning to their BBC office for lunch if they are working less than five miles away, in protest against a \u00a36 limit placed on meal expenses claims. That could leave the corporation without camera crews on important breaking stories. These include the Dando murder trial at the Old Bailey, which is less than five miles away from news headquarters in TV Centre, west London. Union members could take up to two-and-a-half hours for the round trip across the capital. In normal circumstances they would have a 60-minute lunch break. A BBC spokesman said however that news crews at the Old Bailey would be able to go to nearby Bush House for lunch and he did not foresee any disruption. Unions say other stories that could be hit by the action include prime minister Tony Blair's visit to Pentonville Prison and the foot-and-mouth crisis. \"They are going to have to double the crew to cover these stories,\" said a senior Bectu source. \"The BBC is saying staff can only spend \u00a36 on lunch in order to save money but it is going to cost them a lot to get this news footage.\" Bectu called the work to rule for today after its BBC members voted in favour of industrial action over the new expenses rules announced earlier this month.

For director Cronenberg, it's a step back to intimate, smaller-scale pictures after his brief, and ultimately fractious, flirtation with the sequel to Basic Instinct late last year. \u0095 Gerard Depardieu and Stellan Skarsgard are the latest big names to land roles in Matt Dillon's directing debut Beneath the Banyan Trees. Co-written by Dillon with Lost Highway writer Barry Gifford, the film, which also stars James Caan and Natascha McElhone (see earlier story), began shooting last week in Cambodia. \u0095 Last year's Oscar winner Hilary Swank is to star alongside Al Pacino in the remake of the 1997 Norwegian thriller Insomnia (see earlier story). To be directed by Memento creator Christopher Nolan, the film relocates the action to a summery Alaska of almost permanent daylight. Swank, who can be seen from Friday in the supernatural thriller The Gift, will play the role of a local police officer. \u0095 Jodie Foster is mulling over a starring role in the feminist western One Hundred Years On, about a woman beating off invaders at a remote prairie cattle ranch. Foster will produce the picture at Paramount but the studio is reportedly eager to secure her services as an actor as well. At present Foster is bogged down in work on David Fincher's siege thriller Panic Room.",

      "byline": "Faisal Islam",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>When the health secretary, Alan Milburn, announced an investment of \u00a33.1bn to build 29 new hospitals a fortnight ago the Labour heartlands must have jumped with joy. At last their hard-earned taxes and the impossibly large government surplus were going into a decent programme of NHS renewal. Tangible fruits of the prime minister's 'accidental' Breakfast With Frost commitment to raise health spending to EU levels were at last being seen, were they not? </p> <p>Surprisingly perhaps, the money will come not from the Treasury's overflowing coffers, but from groups of private sector construction companies. These consortiums will be repaid by a government commitment made on behalf of future generations of taxpayers, to lease back the hospital's service for the next 30 years. This gigantic hire-purchase agreement for the long-term future of public health is the private finance initiative (PFI). </p> <p>As customers of Radio Rentals may be aware, if you have the money, then outright purchase of a television and video is better value for money than that special monthly rental deal, even if you get to keep the machines at the end. This is particularly the case when, as a government, you can borrow far more cheaply than anyone else. </p> <p>Throw in complaints about cutbacks on bed numbers, poor hospital design, general doubts about value for money and public finances that have never been in such rude health, and the case for PFI looks ever weaker. However, for health service managers wanting to replace late Victorian monoliths with shiny new super-hospitals, the controversial initiative appears to be 'the only game in town'. </p> <p>And Milburn's recent announcement concerned not just an increase in the number of PFI hospitals, but a substantial expansion of their scope. </p> <p>Private sector involvement in the National Health Service in general has massively increased under this government. Last week it was reported that NHS use of private beds has trebled since Alan Milburn signed a concordat with the private sector last October. The bill could reach some \u00a34bn over this year, from \u00a31.25bn last year. </p> <p>The PFI has invoked the greatest ire because its original rationale seemed to have been a wheeze to get vital public spending 'off-book'. It came in very handy during Labour's two-year departmental spending freeze. </p> <p>'We had to get the hospital building programme started. If you like...we had to create a market in PFI because there was not a market,' Milburn told the health select committee in November last year. </p> <p>It's a fallacy to suggest, as many Cabinet ministers have, that PFI brings in extra investment from the private sector. That conclusion can only be reached because of the particular accounting methods used for public spending. On a theoretical, and increasingly on a practical level, PFI can only be justified if it garners private sector expertise and effort through appropriately allocating risks and rewards. </p> <p>At its heart is the idea of incentivisation, and allocation of risks to the bodies best capable of handling them. By specifying contracts in terms of outputs, for example the supply of a hospital premises, the public sector will benefit from the animal spirits of the profit-searching private sector. These urges constantly seek out innovative ways to economise, and so increase productivity, in the public sector. A flexible approach will help promote innovative responses to the challenge of the ageing population, for example. That's the theory anyway. The practice, so far, does not bear out this vision. </p> <p>Incentives have not been aligned as they might. There was the well-publicised finding that the first wave of PFI hospitals contained 30%t fewer hospital beds than had been planned in 1996. </p> <p>Last August The Observer revealed that Sir Stuart Lipton, the government's 'design tsar' described PFI hospitals as disastrously poor 'urban disasters'. Far from being given more opportunity to innovate design to meet changing needs, the same pool of hospital architects is used, and consulted far less. </p> <p>Official evidence of savings from PFI depends heavily on conjecture about the value of 'risk transfer' and the notional value attached to the cost of providing the investment in the public sector - the public sector comparator. Putting a value on risk transfer is tricky, but there is some evidence that the transfer is having some success. Most PFI hospitals are now coming in on schedule. </p> <p>However, many medical professionals claim that contracts are practically risk free. Hospital trusts would never be allowed to go bankrupt, so there is no risk to the consortiums' funds. The money markets appear to concur with this view: the rate at which they lend money to PFI initiative is falling towards the rate offered to government. </p> <p>Labour's favourite think-tank, the Institute of Public Policy Research, is finalising details of an 18-month commission into PFI. </p> <p>Scant evidence of value for money over equivalent Exchequer-funded hospitals has been heard. Furthermore the extent of any savings are unlikely to exceed the millions spent on legal advice and consultancy. The devil is in the detail of the contracts rather than the introduction of PFI per se, according to one submission. For the latest tranche of projects, the Department of Health has guaranteed that bed numbers will not decrease. An emerging view, at least among think-tanks, is that PFI has not been given enough scope to prove its money saving credentials. Truly innovative private sector solutions require management over a wider scope of services, they say. Doing this provides incentives for intelligent use of the whole gamut of health services. </p> <p>Similarly, as health is a labour-intensive sector, true efficiency savings will only be seen when PFI's are in charge of a large proportion of NHS staff. Only 30% of NHS costs come from the areas where PFI's are now operational. </p> <p>Milburn went some way down the first route with the announcement that third wave PFI hospitals will integrate primary and intermediate facilities in the local community 'to help ensure more seamless care for local patients'. </p> <p>But the Rubicon that is yet to be crossed is the provision of clinical services under PFI arrangements. It is being actively considered by the IPPR. But there was a concrete commitment to avoid it in Labour's last manifesto. </p> <p>Bringing together October's concordat, Labour's love affair with PFI, and the withdrawal of private health tax breaks, brings us to something approaching the Canadian health system. It is free at the point of delivery, and therefore not privatised, but serviced by a multitude of private sector providers. It may be some way off yet, but Labour's new manifesto may provide some clues.</p>",

      "bodyText": "When the health secretary, Alan Milburn, announced an investment of \u00a33.1bn to build 29 new hospitals a fortnight ago the Labour heartlands must have jumped with joy. At last their hard-earned taxes and the impossibly large government surplus were going into a decent programme of NHS renewal. Tangible fruits of the prime minister's 'accidental' Breakfast With Frost commitment to raise health spending to EU levels were at last being seen, were they not? Surprisingly perhaps, the money will come not from the Treasury's overflowing coffers, but from groups of private sector construction companies. These consortiums will be repaid by a government commitment made on behalf of future generations of taxpayers, to lease back the hospital's service for the next 30 years. This gigantic hire-purchase agreement for the long-term future of public health is the private finance initiative (PFI). As customers of Radio Rentals may be aware, if you have the money, then outright purchase of a television and video is better value for money than that special monthly rental deal, even if you get to keep the machines at the end. This is particularly the case when, as a government, you can borrow far more cheaply than anyone else. Throw in complaints about cutbacks on bed numbers, poor hospital design, general doubts about value for money and public finances that have never been in such rude health, and the case for PFI looks ever weaker. However, for health service managers wanting to replace late Victorian monoliths with shiny new super-hospitals, the controversial initiative appears to be 'the only game in town'. And Milburn's recent announcement concerned not just an increase in the number of PFI hospitals, but a substantial expansion of their scope. Private sector involvement in the National Health Service in general has massively increased under this government. Last week it was reported that NHS use of private beds has trebled since Alan Milburn signed a concordat with the private sector last October. The bill could reach some \u00a34bn over this year, from \u00a31.25bn last year. The PFI has invoked the greatest ire because its original rationale seemed to have been a wheeze to get vital public spending 'off-book'. It came in very handy during Labour's two-year departmental spending freeze. 'We had to get the hospital building programme started. If you like...we had to create a market in PFI because there was not a market,' Milburn told the health select committee in November last year. It's a fallacy to suggest, as many Cabinet ministers have, that PFI brings in extra investment from the private sector. That conclusion can only be reached because of the particular accounting methods used for public spending. On a theoretical, and increasingly on a practical level, PFI can only be justified if it garners private sector expertise and effort through appropriately allocating risks and rewards. At its heart is the idea of incentivisation, and allocation of risks to the bodies best capable of handling them. By specifying contracts in terms of outputs, for example the supply of a hospital premises, the public sector will benefit from the animal spirits of the profit-searching private sector. These urges constantly seek out innovative ways to economise, and so increase productivity, in the public sector. A flexible approach will help promote innovative responses to the challenge of the ageing population, for example. That's the theory anyway. The practice, so far, does not bear out this vision. Incentives have not been aligned as they might. There was the well-publicised finding that the first wave of PFI hospitals contained 30%t fewer hospital beds than had been planned in 1996. Last August The Observer revealed that Sir Stuart Lipton, the government's 'design tsar' described PFI hospitals as disastrously poor 'urban disasters'. Far from being given more opportunity to innovate design to meet changing needs, the same pool of hospital architects is used, and consulted far less. Official evidence of savings from PFI depends heavily on conjecture about the value of 'risk transfer' and the notional value attached to the cost of providing the investment in the public sector - the public sector comparator. Putting a value on risk transfer is tricky, but there is some evidence that the transfer is having some success. Most PFI hospitals are now coming in on schedule. However, many medical professionals claim that contracts are practically risk free. Hospital trusts would never be allowed to go bankrupt, so there is no risk to the consortiums' funds. The money markets appear to concur with this view: the rate at which they lend money to PFI initiative is falling towards the rate offered to government. Labour's favourite think-tank, the Institute of Public Policy Research, is finalising details of an 18-month commission into PFI. Scant evidence of value for money over equivalent Exchequer-funded hospitals has been heard. Furthermore the extent of any savings are unlikely to exceed the millions spent on legal advice and consultancy. The devil is in the detail of the contracts rather than the introduction of PFI per se, according to one submission. For the latest tranche of projects, the Department of Health has guaranteed that bed numbers will not decrease. An emerging view, at least among think-tanks, is that PFI has not been given enough scope to prove its money saving credentials. Truly innovative private sector solutions require management over a wider scope of services, they say. Doing this provides incentives for intelligent use of the whole gamut of health services. Similarly, as health is a labour-intensive sector, true efficiency savings will only be seen when PFI's are in charge of a large proportion of NHS staff. Only 30% of NHS costs come from the areas where PFI's are now operational. Milburn went some way down the first route with the announcement that third wave PFI hospitals will integrate primary and intermediate facilities in the local community 'to help ensure more seamless care for local patients'. But the Rubicon that is yet to be crossed is the provision of clinical services under PFI arrangements. It is being actively considered by the IPPR. But there was a concrete commitment to avoid it in Labour's last manifesto. Bringing together October's concordat, Labour's love affair with PFI, and the withdrawal of private health tax breaks, brings us to something approaching the Canadian health system. It is free at the point of delivery, and therefore not privatised, but serviced by a multitude of private sector providers. It may be some way off yet, but Labour's new manifesto may provide some clues.",

The decision to put the show on the scrapheap was taken just half way through its run because it flopped in the ratings. Presented by Kaye Adams, it was watched by just 1.5m viewers - a fraction of the audience of hit afternoon shows such as Countdown or The Weakest Link. Public Property was the first show to cash on the sensational popularity of Channel 4's reality TV show Big Brother which made household names of contestants such as Nasty Nick. Made by Anglia TV, it featured a selection of contestants of random ages, who were ordered to perform various tasks by a panel of audience members. The contestants range from 20-something Rebecca and Carla through middle-aged Marvin to elderly Marcia, who were given tasks by the audience to change their lives. But the series, which went out at teatime was panned by the critics. The Mirror's Charlie Catchpole memorably said the show \"makes watching paint dry seem as exciting as white water rafting\". An ITV spokeswoman confirmed that the show had had its run \"shortened\" to make way for the one of the two daily episodes of the reincarnated Crossroads. She said: \"Public Property was a completely innovative show - the first reality show to go out at tea time.

      "bodyText": "The Freeserve internet drama that had 45,000 users glued to their computer screens last year is to be broadcast on TV. Online Caroline enabled web users to interact with the characters of the 24-episode drama, which mixed a sinister plot with elements of comedy. The drama allowed viewers to send emails and phone messages to Caroline and the other characters, who then replied to the messages. Now the company behind Online Caroline, digital entertainment company XPT, has produced nine three-minute episodes for TV. XPT managing director, ex-BBC2 commissions and strategy executive Tom Harvey, is negotiating with television companies to broadcast the programmes. The original Online Caroline was filmed on a TV-quality digital camera, allowing it to be tailored for TV. XPT has also sold the rights to distribute and licence Online Caroline's internet, TV and phones applications across all countries outside the UK to Distraction Formats. Freeserve owns the rights to Online Caroline in the UK. A sequel to Online Caroline is in production and will launch on the web at the end of the year. XPT is also developing an \"immersive\" drama for the web, based around a Greek holiday. It will enable viewers to go on a virtual Greek holiday and where all is not quite what is seems. On the eighth day of the holiday, users are lured to a menacing timeshare property from which they may - or may not - return.",

      "body": "<p>Dateline: A newsagent's somewhere in the south of England ... </p> <p>It was still dark when The Box arrived. I watched as the newspaper delivery van cruised to a halt. A lithe young man sprang out and slid open the side door. In a swift, practised movement he heaved quires of papers on to his shoulder, tottered three steps into the doorway and dropped the bundle inside. There was no indication yet that this was anything other than a normal morning. Mr Patel took his knife from under the counter and began to cut the bindings as more bundles were carried from the van. </p> <p>Then, instead of the usual goodbye grunt, came the moment I had been waiting for. \"Something extra for you today, Pattie,\" said the young man. And there it was. The Box. The latest deadly weapon in the century-long circulation war between the Daily Express and the Daily Mail. </p> <p>As the van pulled away, I stepped from my hiding place behind a hedge at No 42 ***** (names and addresses have been changed or concealed to protect the innocent). Posing as if I was a customer studying the magazine rack, I noted Mr Patel's explosion of joy as he realised what The Box was all about. It was designed to look like a carton of tissues, only bigger. On top was a slogan: \"Stronger Than Ever: Wipe Away Those Fears.\" Inside were wrap-around Daily Mail front pages, headlined \"A Cleaner, Brighter Daily Read: Save \u00a39.90 on home delivery.\" </p> <p>The centre pages showed a reproduction of the Guardian's story which revealed the seedy truth about the pornographic empire run by the Express's new owner, Richard Desmond. It urged Express readers to try \"a cleaner alternative\" instead. </p> <p>Mr Patel smiled. He was being asked to persuade buyers of the Daily Express to sign up for a cheap six-week trial of the Daily Mail. In return, he would receive \u00a35 and, if he won more recruits than anyone else, his shop would get a \u00a35,000 re-fit. </p> <p>I eavesdropped as he explained the offer to his wife. \"But we only sell 18 Expresses,\" she said. \"Well, that's \u00a390,\" said Mr Patel. \"And it doesn't say there's anything wrong in signing up Mirror and Sun readers as well. Who'll know?\" I made my excuses and left. I had witnessed, at the front line, the impact of the Mail's newest attempt to boost its sales, a tactic used first in Scotland and now extended across Britain. </p> <p>Opening my Express on Tuesday, I observed that Desmond and his editor, Chris Williams, were not going to take the assault lying down, accusing the Mail of \"plumbing the depths by spreading endless lies about the Express and attempting to undermine our distribution system\". </p> <p>Lies? It's hard to agree about that. The Mail literature about Desmond's pornographic activities, Express staff leaving, others being made redundant and plunging sales were surely accurate. </p> <p>As for distribution, the Mail's initiative is legally watertight if ethically suspect, because retailers are getting an incentive to encourage their customers to switch titles. It is, according to circulation staff in other papers, a very clever ploy but utterly ruthless and hugely expensive. In response, the Express has hit back in the paper with features about the Rothermere dynasty, owners of the Mail since it was founded in 1896. The profiles ran over old ground, about the first Lord Rothermere's 1930s fascism and the third Lord Rothermere's colourful private life. </p> <p>Next day came the more contentious matter of the fourth, and current, Lord Rothermere's fathering of a child out of wedlock more than 13 years ago. This revelation first appeared in Punch a couple of years ago, but no national paper would touch it then. </p> <p>At the time, the old convention which protected newspaper proprietors from scrutiny in rival papers held firm. In breaking that custom, Desmond and Williams show just how desperate their situation has become. They obviously feel they have nothing to lose. </p> <p>They also have a point in illustrating the Mail's double standards: as a self-appointed virtuous champion of family values it has tended to stigmatise single parenthood. Just because the rich can afford to provide well for their illegitimate offspring does not justify sneering at poor philanderers. </p> <p>Then again, on the admittedly shifting scale of values, most people would probably argue that the pornographic exploitation of women is far worse than the hypocrisy of a paper promoting standards its owner has failed to uphold. </p> <p>To equate Rothermere's moment of youthful indiscretion with Desmond's life-long career as a pornographer is patently wrong. But this is war and, in war, everyone suffers, the innocent and the guilty and those somewhere in between. What is unusual, and rather enjoyable, is that for once the generals, Desmond and Rothermere, find themselves taking the flak rather than the poor bloody infantry. </p> <p>Who, though, is more likely to win? One doesn't really need to be a veteran circulation war correspondent to answer that. The Mail group is richer. The Daily Mail is selling 2.4m to the Daily Express's 950,000, while the Mail on Sunday is selling 2.3m to the Sunday Express's 870,000. Rothermere heads a team with vast experience, huge resources and awesome manpower. Desmond heads a team without any national paper experience, few resources and dwindling manpower. </p> <p>David may have beaten Goliath, but it's hard to imagine what secret weapon Desmond can utilise. He has sacked the reps, the people on the ground who maintain contact with newsagents and who are the Mail's key players in turning newsagents into Mail persuaders. </p> <p>He has lost a circulation director and a marketing director. In further cost-cutting moves, he has let it be known that he intends to make 50, and maybe 100, journalists redundant. </p> <p>His company is ham-strung by a printing contract with Regional Independent Media at its Lancashire plant which means it loses money. He has failed to raise anticipated funds by selling off the Express's half of the London print centre because the Telegraph group won't agree to his sale price. Desmond may think he is a tough negotiator but Telegraph deputy chairman Dan Colson is in a different league. </p> <p>In other words, the Express is in terrible shape. That begs another question, of course. Why is the Mail bothering to spend so much money on crushing a rival which is, to all intents and purposes, already beaten? </p> <p>It might appear cynical to call on the philosophy of WC Fields, about never giving a sucker an even break. But cynicism is relevant when talking of newspaper competition: the spur to the Mail's action is based on the fact that it smells defeat. Desmond's ownership gives it a chance it never had before. The Mail has seized on its opponent's Achilles heel. </p> <p>Historical context is relevant too: the Mail played second fiddle in sales terms to the Express until 1982, and didn't really pull ahead until Paul Dacre became editor a decade later. </p> <p>Any newspaper historian can point to two excellent examples of struggling papers with falling circulations that have come back from the dead to triumph, such as the Sun and the Mail itself. </p> <p>But we also need to view the Mail's wish to dispense with the Express once and for all as a prelude to the battle it wishes to pursue next, with the Daily Telegraph. Dacre sees that paper as his main competitor in future. </p> <p>Many Express journalists will smile ruefully at this turn of events. Only four months ago, it was Dacre who was promising them a good future when the Mail's owners made a serious bid to buy their paper. Now the putative saviour is trying to kill them off. </p> <p> Though there may not be much sympathy for Desmond, there is considerable understanding for the Express staff. Williams, a former Mail executive, and his journalists have been producing a lively paper, and they certainly deserve better back-up than Desmond is providing. </p> <p>Seen from the other side, there is also, as the Express illustrated on Friday with a piece entitled \"Hate Mail\", any number of people who have a deep loathing of the Mail and all its works. </p> <p>One of the celebrities quoted was Stephen Fry, regarded as a gentle man who rarely loses his temper. But he cannot bear the Mail's ethos, saying: \"It typifies everything that is most shaming about this country in terms of its lurches towards xenophobia and fear: everything in the name of the family, that horrible capital F for family. It's become what the state was for a Stalinist: everything that is done in the name of the family is acceptable.\" </p> <p>This tirade is a reminder that, as successful as the Mail undoubtedly is, it arouses violent passions, as I discovered when I defended the paper last week after it lost a libel action. The more powerful a paper, the more the public distrust it, including many of those who buy it. </p> <p>Not that such considerations will affect Mr Patel and his ilk. They stand to make a tidy sum by cajoling their customers into buying the Mail at cut price for six weeks. Desmond says he will retaliate. But how? When he bought the Express in November, he said everything was OK at the Express. It isn't now.</p>",

      "bodyText": "\"This sort of thing may be tolerated by the French, but we're British - thank God.\" So decreed Field Marshal Montgomery as he urged the House of Lords not to legalise gay sex and warned that the 1967 homosexuality bill would be a \"charter for buggery\". More than 30 years on, the gay age of consent has been equalised to 16, homosexuals are allowed to serve in the military - and Britain's most famous wartime general has been outed as a repressed homosexual who had \"quasi love affairs\" with boys and men, according to a new book. The Full Monty, by his official biographer, Nigel Hamilton, claims that Montgomery felt passionately about fellow soldiers and boys, some not yet in their teens. Professor Hamilton, whose official life of Montgomery was in 1981 awarded the Whitbread prize for biography, has drawn on hundreds of letters to and from Montgomery. He admits there was no proof of any physical relationship with any of the young men who wrote, but argues that any act would have been illegal and could have spelt ruin for the wartime hero. \"Don't forget homosexuality was outlawed from 1885 to 1967. Those who did act on their instincts could, like Oscar Wilde, be imprisoned and ruined,\" he said yesterday from Boston, where he works at the University of Massachusetts. \"He acted very negatively to the change in the law - calling it a 'charter for buggery'. He was extremely worried by it, and psychologically that suggests the law had been an essential crutch in his struggle with his own homosexual feelings.\" Rumours about the sexuality of the man who won the battle of El Alamein in 1942, turning the tide of the war in north Africa, have previously circulated. As early as 1976 - five years after his death - one earlier biographer, Lord Chalfont, noted his \"predilection for the company of young men\". Last night, Montgomery's only son, Viscount David Montgomery, dismissed the new claim as being \"absurd, appalling, and complete psychobabble\". Another biographer, Alistair Horne, author of The Lonely Leader, commented: \"This sounds to me like Hamilton is rehashing his old work for a tabloid readership. \"I served under Montgomery in the Middle East and I have absolutely no evidence whatsoever of repressed, or any other kind, of homosexuality.\" Prof Hamilton, who was befriended by the field marshal at age 11 and knew him well for the last 20 years of his life, has no doubt of the nature of Monty's feelings. \"These were quasi love affairs. He became really passionately involved with these young men - and then, more and more, boys, who he would call 'my sons'. They were nothing of the kind, of course, but in his own personality he would frame them in this way. \"I myself have more than 100 very loving letters from him. My relationship with him wasn't sexual, in the sense that it wasn't acted upon, but I had been through enough years at British boarding schools to know what kind of enormous affection and feeling he had for me. \"And I wasn't alone, this was a consistent pattern in Monty's life.\" One boy was Lucien Treub, Montgomery's \"little Swiss friend\", who met him at 12, and told Hamilton how the general would bathe him personally and rub him down so he would not catch cold. \"I've interviewed him several times and he was quite clear he didn't feel there was any molesting going on, but it's a tricky area,\" Prof Hamilton said. Born in 1887, Montgomery was married for 10 years from 1927, but the academic described this an \"an aberration\" in what had otherwise been a life devoted entirely to being with men. He added that he had pondered on whether to write about Monty's sexuality when his acclaimed three-part biography was published in the 1980s, but felt that his main aim was to restore the field marshal's military reputation \"at a time it was being systematically trashed: I didn't want to detract from that\". Sexuality under scrutiny Historical figures whose sexuality has been the subject of debate: TE Lawrence The soldier and writer claimed, in The Seven Pillars of Wisdom, that he was whipped and raped by a Turkish officer in the first world war. In 1992 his biographer Lawrence James described it as a \"homoerotic fantasy\", but said Lawrence was homosexual in his later years. Jane Austen In 1996 an incestuous relationship was suggested by Terry Castle of Stanford University: the novelist's letters showed \"the passionate nature of the sibling bond\". She never married, and shared a bed with her sister - but that was not unusual at the time. Austen scholars dismissed the claim. Daphne du Maurier Married and a mother of three, the novelist had an affair with the actress Gertrude Lawrence, an authorised biography said in 1993. She had her first fling with a teacher nicknamed \"Ferdy\", and was torn between \"Cairo\", or heterosexuality, and \"Venice\", or lesbianism. William Shakespeare Ever since Oscar Wilde claimed the Elizabethan playwright was in love with a boy actor, Willie Hewes, critics have claimed he was gay - relying on his sonnets for justification. Leonardo da Vinci The ultimate renaissance man has long been held to be gay ,and in 1476 he was tried and acquitted of sodomy. In 1998, an academic suggested bisexuality in Leonardo's \"intense relationship\" with a courtesan in his 60s.",

Julian Drinkall is to join IPC as group strategy director. IPC chief executive Sly Bailey said Mr Drinkall had been appointed to play a \"critical part in the evolution of IPC from a magazines to a media business\". Mr Drinkall, who joined the BBC in 1998, was directly involved with the licence fee renewal process as the BBC's head of strategy. He was later promoted to head of financial and commercial strategy, taking on overall responsibility for the BBC's financial activities. He has also worked at BBC Worldwide and BBC Online.

Mr Drinkall told MediaGuardian.co.uk he wanted to form alliances with media companies to take IPC's highest profile brands onto television, including acquisitions where appropriate. He indicated that long-running speculation of joint ventures between IPC and music broadcaster MTV could gather pace. \"Music is obviously one of IPC's main strengths and key to its long-term strategy,\" he said. IPC last year reorganised itself as a \"media-neutral, brand-centric\" company in the first indication the company needs to move away from its reliance on paper-based magazines. This month's magazine ABCs were depressing for several sections of the consumer press, and IPC, Britain's largest magazine publisher, is looking at ways to reduce its reliance on paper.

      "bodyText": "Favourite websites? Amazon. As a user I adore it. The site is so quick and well laid out, but I've had problems using it as a novelist. They really weren't hi-tech and well organised; they wouldn't accept material by email, and it was very frustrating. I do really like iamdb, which is an excellent resource for movie information. You can check out exactly what people in the industry are doing, research films while they are still in production, and find out if people have made up stuff about producing the next Hollywood blockbuster. Last online purchase? A personalised travel guidebook from Tailorbook. You give them the places which you are interested in visiting and they compile and dispatch a customised guidebook. Most recent technological faux pas? I had problems trying to send an email via a hyperlink when I was surfing the net. You have to enable your email package to work with your software package. Ever been in a chat room? Yes, on my own website, I like to listen to people's opinions about theatre productions. Main news source on the web? I tend not to look for general news but go for specific updates on the theatre or news from the US. I check CNN and Playbill which is a fantastic site for New York theatre reviews. Most useful site on the web? The Spotlight is really useful. I also like Dictionary for checking things if I'm writing. Which site is least likely to succeed? I think so many business are failing, not because they have flawed business models or bad funds, but because the market has turned so dramatically. The backlash has gone too far. A lot of people can't make it now because of circumstances beyond their control. I still think it's almost riskier to be in a PLC than a start-up. At least with a start-up you know the management are there and are going to make it work any way they can. Time spent on the web? All day every day. Least useful site on the web? The Spark is fun but not useful. Do you use a screensaver? A picture of my two-year-old niece. Most irritating thing about the web? Spam. I'm inundated with it. It also means I get a lot of viruses. I was sent the Anna Kournikova one three times! I also get annoyed when search engines aren't updated and have so many dead links. Do you still bother with old media? Yes. I trained as a journalist and still read at least three papers every day. \u0095 Terri Paddock is the director of What's on stage which relaunches today.",

      "body": "<p>Is the BBC about to lose its freedom? For nearly 75 years, since its foundation as a public corporation, the Beeb has managed to steer an independent route between the clutches of the state on the one hand and the suffocating embrace of the commercial marketplace on the other. Of course, there have been times when it stepped over the line - a little too close to government during the 1930s and late 1980s, a little too commercialised during the 1960s. But these were periods of adaptation, which protected it from any large-scale interference. </p> <p>For all the compromises it has had to make to fend off periodic calls for privatisation, the BBC has been allowed to pursue its own vision of public service broadcasting. It has not had its agenda determined by those who are driven by different objectives - whether they be incumbent governments wishing to suppress uncomfortable information, or commercial companies trying to boost shareholder dividends. It has been a fascinating journey of institutional endurance, and British culture has been enormously enriched by it. </p> <p>Those days may be numbered. Reading through some of the responses to the government's white paper on communications, and listening to recent ministerial statements, it is increasingly clear that the knives are out for the BBC. It is in severe danger of being caught between the self-interested animosity of commercial rivals and the less self-interested, but equally threatening, moves towards government intervention. </p> <p>The issue that has crystallised this problem is whether the BBC should come under the auspices of the proposed pan-industry regulator, Ofcom. This new body has, to widespread approval, been proposed by the government to regulate the private-sector communications industry. To some surprise - and to the BBC's relief - the government decided that, apart from taste and decency, and complaints, the BBC should continue to be regulated by its board of governors and not be swept up within Ofcom's remit. </p> <p>This has not gone down well with the BBC's competitors, who see Ofcom as a perfect vehicle for restraining the BBC's overzealous tendency - as they see it - to encroach on commercially valuable territory. None of them put it in such blunt terms, of course, and their arguments are ostensibly logical and sensible. The words \"level\" and \"playing field\" were much in evidence. </p> <p>ITV, for example, believes the proposals do not meet the objectives of \"clarity, coherence and a level playing field\". It is worried that \"significant changes\" to BBC television schedules (for example, moving Omnibus from BBC1 to BBC2) will \"reduce their distinctiveness, and result in unfair competition for commercially funded single public service channels\". In other words, the new regulator should have the power to force the BBC to leave Omnibus where it is and thus make BBC1 less of a threat to ITV. </p> <p>BSkyB, predictably, complains about \"the continued incursion of BBC licence-fee-funded services into areas which the market is well able to serve\". It wants Ofcom to ensure that new BBC services \"do not duplicate similar commercial channels\". We can safely assume that a BSkyB definition of \"similar\" means anything currently supplied or planned by BSkyB, regardless of the quality of its content. </p> <p>Channel 4 continues the theme by arguing that a single regulator is \"the only logical response\" to convergence. It then turns the argument on its head and suggests that allowing the BBC to operate independently risks \"marginalising and ultimately ghettoising it\" - although it offers no convincing arguments as to why. </p> <p>The Radio Authority wants to see all broadcasting brought within a single regulator by the next renewal of the BBC charter (2006), while the ITC - which has speedily assumed the role of Ofcom-in-waiting - is cleverly opaque. It calls for an effective process \"to ensure that the BBC's obligations and contributions to the range of public service provision are considered as a whole with those of the commercial public service broadcasters\". The current proposals allow Ofcom to comment on BBC services but not to dictate terms to the corporation. Is the ITC happy with that? Recent statements suggest not, but it can't be too blatantly expansionist. </p> <p>Of the significant non-broadcaster observers, only the National Consumer Council follows the commercial broadcaster line that the BBC should lose its independence, although curiously it is one of the staunchest supporters of public service broadcasting. Despite this, it is happy to see Ofcom deciding that \"a particular service should be provided by a commercial PSB provider, rather than the BBC\" if that would serve the consumer interest. </p> <p>This illustrates one of the key problems with the pan-regulator argument. To assume that industry regulators can operate purely according to the best interests of end-users - with no consideration for the trading conditions or profitability of the companies they regulate - is to misunderstand the history of regulation. Every regulator is under intense pressure to relax the economic burden on private companies. Ultimately, all regulators must compromise in the face of the private sector's determination to generate profits and create jobs. </p> <p>But the fundamental difference in this case is the attempt to lump a publicly funded institution, which has a unique heritage and a parliamentary mandate, together with the whole of the private sector. Any diktat from Ofcom to a commercial operator to make more current affairs, or children's programmes, or experimental drama will always invite the response: \"The BBC's got public money and a charter. Tell it to do it. We can't afford it.\" Why should Ofcom allow the BBC to compete for soccer highlights, pilot a new quiz show, introduce a new soap opera or commission a new police drama series? </p> <p>All of these could be - indeed, have been - significant BBC contributions to our viewing choices, and help to cement the BBC's place as a broadcaster of universal appeal. Hand the BBC over to Ofcom and, as night follows day, there would follow a systematic erosion of its popular base until it became precisely the kind of American-style unwatched public broadcaster which Channel 4 warns against. At that point, the licence fee - and therefore the BBC - dies. It's not difficult to level the playing field if we don't mind barren land. </p> <p>So what of government action? In mounting his defence, culture minister Chris Smith is being forced into promises of government intervention. For example, asked at the select committee inquiry two weeks ago about why the BBC should be able to change schedules or formats without reference to the commercial sector, Smith replied: \"Where there are significant changes to the nature of a channel, then that is a matter which ultimately would have to be considered by the secretary of state.\" He gave a similar assurance at a Channel 4/NCC sponsored seminar last Monday. </p> <p>In policy terms, this may be no more than restating an announcement made last June that the secretary of state will have the power to judge \"material changes\" to existing BBC services against a set of published criteria. But it further legitimises a worrying and increasing tendency towards ministerial intervention in, or comment on, BBC affairs. Smith, for example, was described as being \"deeply worried\" about plans for a more populist BBC1, and as being \"incensed\" about the Nine O'clock News move. He has expressed concern about the number of BBC reruns and the inadequacy of cost-cutting plans. He likes to make his feelings known. </p> <p>That's not how it used to be. Eight years ago, for the Guardian, I interviewed three former home secretaries about their relationship with the BBC (in the days when the Home Office was the responsible department). They were all agreed about the need to remain silent on BBC matters. In the words of Willie Whitelaw: \"It is a very important tradition that the home secretary does not, by the very nature of his office, apply pressure on the BBC. I would never publicly, when I was home secretary, make criticism of the BBC.\" As a firm supporter of the BBC, Smith's involvement is (mostly) benign, but his successors' may be less so. It is a dangerous precedent. </p> <p> So is there a middle way between the rock of commercial self-interest and the hard place of government intervention? The answer is yes, and it lies in an overhaul of the board of governors. In its white paper response, Bectu calls for \"a clear and meaningful separation of the governors from the management of the BBC\", including a separate secretariat and a more tightly drawn PSB remit. This is perfectly consistent with the demands of the commercial sector that the BBC be tied more closely to specific programming promises, but maintains the fundamental principle of BBC independence. </p> <p>It should also satisfy those, such as the Campaign for Quality Television, which supports the BBC but is known to have reservations about issues such as transparency and the programme commissioning process. </p> <p>Precisely what the mechanisms of scrutiny would be, and how it might guarantee more transparency and a proper accountability for the expenditure of public money, are urgent questions in the run up to the next charter renewal. Whatever the answer, sacrificing the BBC's unique freedom to invigorate our public culture on the altar of a \"level playing field\" is not it. </p> <p>\u0095 Steven Barnett is professor of communications at the University of Westminster. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:S.Barnett@wmin.ac.uk\">S.Barnett@wmin.ac.uk</a></p>",

      "body": "<p>As a marketing and distribution tool for musicians, websites are challenging conventions of fan loyalty, copyright (thanks to Napster), and brand image. </p> <p>Firstly, they have replaced the official fanclubs. Gone are the days of the drummer's aunt sitting in a makeshift office in the spare bedroom sifting through bags of mail. Now there tends to be two types of site - the official initiative from the record company and the alternative fan or \"stalker\" sites. </p> <p>Although the revenue raised from the official sites is presently insignificant, the information and the database that is subsequently generated from the site are extremely valuable. Via the web, record companies and fans have become the publishers of their own magazines. </p> <p>According to Marcus Vinton, executive creative director of digital communications for the Ogilvy and WPP Group, the past few years have seen a fundamental and radical shift in the way the music industry markets brands online. \"The new marketing mix has come to utilise the web and other digital channels for their artists as brands in their own right. The web is a highly targeted tool providing a depth of content that could never be reached through conventional 'off-line' channels,\" he explains. </p> <p>A successful web presence can do wonders for bands. But as Mark Richardson, managing director of Independiente Records, who represent Travis and Paul Weller, says: \"The prosperity of the site involves a huge investment in terms of time. The most important thing is that the talent is involved. Two of the most successful sites currently are <a href=\"http://www.travisonline.com/\">Travis</a>'s and <a href=\"http://www.radiohead.com/\">Radiohead</a>'s - mainly because the bands have creative control over them.\" </p> <p>Top of the range musician websites include the David Bowie's four-year-old <a href=\"http://www.davidbowie.com/\" target=\"_NEW\">BowieNet</a> - the first music-based, artist-supported ISP; <a href=\"http://www.u2.com/intro.html\">U2</a>'s offering - a digital cornucopia of graphics, information, videos and downloading facilities; and <a href=\"http://www.thesecondline.com/\">Clinic</a>'s for its track Second Line. However, Vinton believes that the majority of sites show little functionality or understanding of their commercial equity: \"In general, the entertainment industry sites are among the least entertaining. <a href=\"http://allthingsmustpass.com\">George Harrison</a>'s new offering at least is fun and a natural extension of his own beliefs and inspirations. However, the web is still vastly under-used by the industry.\" </p> <p>Harrison's new website which is promoting the re-release of his 70s album All Things Must Pass, features pissing, giggling gnomes, screaming guitar solos, and all things Monty Python-esque. It is a relief to see that a seasoned rocker is not trying to be edgy or hip - witness the image of a hirsute Harrison on the home page sporting a sun hat and wellies, while being pissed on by a laughing garden gnome. </p> <p>The quiet Beatle, who is more likely to be found gardening than surfing the global freeway, had complete disregard for the medium at the start of the project. But he agreed with the design team at <a href=\"http://www.radicalmedia.com/\">@radical.media</a>, that the prospect of making a music video \"hurt\". Consequently, the website project was more appropriate. </p> <p>Creativity aside, the main issue currently affecting musicians' online offerings is the Napster ruling. This week witnessed a judgement to prevent Napster operating as an unrestricted independent. \"Ironically Napster has been penalised for doing no more than wanting to share its love of music,\" adds Vinton. \"The company helped over 50m community members to do this with other people's music, for free, and threatened to undermine some of the most powerful divisions in the world. Today many artists have a far more mature understanding of their musical rights as well as a belief that their generation has a natural and demographic need to communicate online.\" </p> <p>Richardson of Independiente Records sees the Napster ruling as an attempt to set a legal precedent. He says: \"The ruling is about copyright paranoia. It is no different to when kids tape the radio, or the arguments against videos when they were first introduced. Most musicians' sites only have 30 seconds of the track as that legally negates the payment of any royalties, or the music is encrypted so that you can't copy it. Whereas the issue with Napster is that it allows you to have a copy of the track. But you can easily go into any high-street retailer and buy the technology to allow you to download music. </p> <p>\"Downloading music doesn't take away anything from record sales. The fan will always buy the CD because they are loyal to the band and because the quality of the download isn't great. Radiohead put all of its Kid A album on Napster and it still went to number one in the US.\" </p> <p>Others disagree. Drew Leavy, a consultant with digital strategy consultancy Decipher, believes that mp3 will have a detrimental effect on CD sales. \"I used to buy four CDs a month, but now I download everything, and I haven't bought a CD in six months. It's a logical choice. Why pay \u00a315 for a lump of plastic, of which the band gets very little, when you can download? </p> <p>\"The UK record companies and retailers have to be more realistic about pricing, and it will be the retailers who will suffer most. The true fans will still buy the CD, but why should you buy something by a band you're iffy about when you can download? In general, fans are into the band, they don't give a toss about record companies' copyright and profit. Fans are loyal to bands who show that they want their music to be freely available. </p> <p>\"The ruling against Napster is not the be-all and end-all of digital music. The net is now an audio galaxy and record companies have to come to terms with the digital format. As compression, storage and audio standards improve and the net becomes more creative, record companies will really have to prove their validity.\" </p> <p>Undoubtedly, digital marketing, production and distribution will change the way music works in the future. Ultimately it will redefine the relationship with the consumer, because multi-channel opportunities offer solutions that could potentially exist completely in a digital environment. </p> <p>Looking ahead, Vinton predicts that in 2005 more than 50% of the nation will have access to a digital TV platform and t-commerce will be worth approximately \u00a3275m in the UK alone. The future may well witness hybrid MTV-type broadcasts, structured as pay-per-view models, or with a personalised download service. Because of this it is possible that a strategic alignment of labels could end up challenging high-street music retailers.</p>",

George Harrison's new offering at least is fun and a natural extension of his own beliefs and inspirations. However, the web is still vastly under-used by the industry.\" Harrison's new website which is promoting the re-release of his 70s album All Things Must Pass, features pissing, giggling gnomes, screaming guitar solos, and all things Monty Python-esque. It is a relief to see that a seasoned rocker is not trying to be edgy or hip - witness the image of a hirsute Harrison on the home page sporting a sun hat and wellies, while being pissed on by a laughing garden gnome. The quiet Beatle, who is more likely to be found gardening than surfing the global freeway, had complete disregard for the medium at the start of the project. But he agreed with the design team at @radical.media, that the prospect of making a music video \"hurt\". Consequently, the website project was more appropriate. Creativity aside, the main issue currently affecting musicians' online offerings is the Napster ruling. This week witnessed a judgement to prevent Napster operating as an unrestricted independent. \"Ironically Napster has been penalised for doing no more than wanting to share its love of music,\" adds Vinton. \"The company helped over 50m community members to do this with other people's music, for free, and threatened to undermine some of the most powerful divisions in the world. Today many artists have a far more mature understanding of their musical rights as well as a belief that their generation has a natural and demographic need to communicate online.\" Richardson of Independiente Records sees the Napster ruling as an attempt to set a legal precedent. He says: \"The ruling is about copyright paranoia. It is no different to when kids tape the radio, or the arguments against videos when they were first introduced. Most musicians' sites only have 30 seconds of the track as that legally negates the payment of any royalties, or the music is encrypted so that you can't copy it. Whereas the issue with Napster is that it allows you to have a copy of the track. But you can easily go into any high-street retailer and buy the technology to allow you to download music. \"Downloading music doesn't take away anything from record sales. The fan will always buy the CD because they are loyal to the band and because the quality of the download isn't great. Radiohead put all of its Kid A album on Napster and it still went to number one in the US.\" Others disagree. Drew Leavy, a consultant with digital strategy consultancy Decipher, believes that mp3 will have a detrimental effect on CD sales. \"I used to buy four CDs a month, but now I download everything, and I haven't bought a CD in six months. It's a logical choice. Why pay \u00a315 for a lump of plastic, of which the band gets very little, when you can download? \"The UK record companies and retailers have to be more realistic about pricing, and it will be the retailers who will suffer most. The true fans will still buy the CD, but why should you buy something by a band you're iffy about when you can download? In general, fans are into the band, they don't give a toss about record companies' copyright and profit. Fans are loyal to bands who show that they want their music to be freely available. \"The ruling against Napster is not the be-all and end-all of digital music. The net is now an audio galaxy and record companies have to come to terms with the digital format. As compression, storage and audio standards improve and the net becomes more creative, record companies will really have to prove their validity.\" Undoubtedly, digital marketing, production and distribution will change the way music works in the future. Ultimately it will redefine the relationship with the consumer, because multi-channel opportunities offer solutions that could potentially exist completely in a digital environment. Looking ahead, Vinton predicts that in 2005 more than 50% of the nation will have access to a digital TV platform and t-commerce will be worth approximately \u00a3275m in the UK alone. The future may well witness hybrid MTV-type broadcasts, structured as pay-per-view models, or with a personalised download service. Because of this it is possible that a strategic alignment of labels could end up challenging high-street music retailers.",

      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Jane Hewland is sitting in a windowless office, lined with purple football shirts, in a grim warehouse off the Old Kent Road. Demolition is taking place all around - it's a far cry from the LWT tower, with its views up and down the Thames, where she made her name before abruptly quitting 11 years ago. </p> <p>In the media equivalent of losing a winning lottery ticket, Hewland handed back her portion of those now famous golden handcuff share options which made multimillionaires of a lucky few former LWT colleagues, from Greg Dyke and Christopher Bland to Melvyn Bragg. But she's looking contented. </p> <p>For here on the Old Kent Road it is two minutes from Millwall football ground. This is where her cult Sky One football soap, Dream Team, is based. It's the one which breaks the rules by taking Premier League footage and then colouring one team's shirts purple to make them look like Dream Team's Harchester United. She also pays real footballers to turn up at Millwall to film close contact shots. </p> <p>Hewland's creation, the UK's first football soap - with believable football, and lots of tabloid storylines - has just been given a renewed vote of confidence from Sky One's fresh management team, after a tricky year. A fifth series, upped to 32 hours, on top of the 200 episodes already made, has been ordered, to run twice a week, and will sit alongside a new Australian teen soap. There will be repeats, branded as half-hour Harchester United TV (a spoof on MUTV), running this summer. </p> <p>In between, Hewland International, her production company, is making a BBC Worldwide educational drama, called Goal, for foreign students of English, using football as bait. And ITV has paid her a compliment by commissioning its own series, Footballers' Wives - from the team behind the sensational Bad Girls. \"There'll be as much football in it as there was oil in Dallas,\" growls Nick Elliott, ITV's drama controller and another LWT multimillionaire. </p> <p>Hewland has also just landed a 13-hour drama order from Sky One, for Mile High, about the raunchy antics of air hostesses, due for screening in early 2002. \"The top factual shows are Airport and Airline, and they can't show what really goes on. We were onto drunken pilots ages ago,\" she observes with a happy smile. </p> <p>Hewland has a reputation for being creative, highly intelligent and ahead of the game, but a little wacky - and not just because she walked away from \u00a39-10m in March 1990. \"She's a very, very bright woman, and dangerously fearless,\" observes Elliott. \"The thing was,\" says Hewland, \"I was too stupid. I realised later that if I had got them to sack me, I would have kept the shares. I got nothing out of it. God, I don't mind. It's very weird, you get to a certain age [she was 40 then], it's nothing to do with talent, but there are periods of your life when nothing you touch works. I'd worked incredibly happily up to that point.\" </p> <p>Greg Dyke, then her LWT boss, had made her controller of current affairs in 1988 but it hadn't worked out. \"I hugely admire Greg but I guess I was a John Birt person, brought up through that system.\" </p> <p>Last year was another iffy period. She failed to win an ITV soap commission with her ideas about flashy Essex millionaires. And under Sky One's general manager, David Bergg, the hotshot scheduler lured from ITV, Dream Team faced the axe. But it was Bergg who walked the plank. </p> <p>\"The spirit there [at Sky One] is just so different now,\" says Hewland. \"For the past year, we've been dealing with a bunch of completely confused people trying to put the best face on it, all trying desperately to defend their corner. But now everyone is relaxed and happy, it is back to the basics, Sky as it was in 1997 [when Dream Team, commissioned by Lis Murdoch, began]. I know it is much harder for them now that Channel 4 has got its act together on the entertainment side, but the way forward is to offer a version of the [brash] Fox network.\" </p> <p>As for David Bergg's vision of Sky One, appealing to the Sunny Delight ITV family audience? \"I really don't think there is any point in trying to be another ITV or BBC because Sky hasn't got the money. Audiences go to BBC first, then ITV, so why go to Sky? Also, what did you think about Harry Enfield going to Sky? For audiences it's like, 'So that's the only one which would have him.' It's counterproductive,\" she says. </p> <p>\"Whereas if you start with something that's your own brand, that you build, then you've got something to offer - cult viewing which people know they can't get anywhere else. It was that way with Ibiza Uncovered, Prickly Heat, and The Simpsons and Friends, before they were flogged elsewhere. </p> <p>\"I never took Mile High near David Bergg. He didn't want long-running series. I was arguing that with BBC and ITV news both going to 10 pm we had a gift. We have to go in there and try and clean up with long-running brands, particularly on Sky because people sample it only when the terrestrial channels don't satisfy.\" </p> <p>The evening before our interview Hewland dipped back into her earlier cerebral life: she was at the House of Lords for a recorded brainstorming session called by Lord [John] Birt. He's writing his memoirs and has reached 1972/73 and the famed creation of Weekend World and its \"mission to explain\". </p> <p>\"Weekend World was a fantastic education for everyone who worked on it, and that's shown by the fact that they've gone out and run the rest of British television. Whether it was at all significant for the audience I can't tell. It was like a giant university compound for the media establishment,\" she says. </p> <p>By 1987, when Birt went to the BBC, she'd already joined forces with Janet Street-Porter to create the slick Network 7, for Channel 4, the foundation of the \"yoof\" programming genre. \"The first person to do anything is a fool, because they always fuck up. Then everyone else comes along. Network 7 is the only thing I've done where being first worked.\" </p> <p>As for being a businesswoman? \"It has taken me 10 years to learn how I should have started. First of all, I didn't have a partner. You have to have somebody to bat ideas about. I had this huge wake-up call last year.

      "bodyText": "Jane Hewland is sitting in a windowless office, lined with purple football shirts, in a grim warehouse off the Old Kent Road. Demolition is taking place all around - it's a far cry from the LWT tower, with its views up and down the Thames, where she made her name before abruptly quitting 11 years ago. In the media equivalent of losing a winning lottery ticket, Hewland handed back her portion of those now famous golden handcuff share options which made multimillionaires of a lucky few former LWT colleagues, from Greg Dyke and Christopher Bland to Melvyn Bragg. But she's looking contented. For here on the Old Kent Road it is two minutes from Millwall football ground. This is where her cult Sky One football soap, Dream Team, is based. It's the one which breaks the rules by taking Premier League footage and then colouring one team's shirts purple to make them look like Dream Team's Harchester United. She also pays real footballers to turn up at Millwall to film close contact shots. Hewland's creation, the UK's first football soap - with believable football, and lots of tabloid storylines - has just been given a renewed vote of confidence from Sky One's fresh management team, after a tricky year. A fifth series, upped to 32 hours, on top of the 200 episodes already made, has been ordered, to run twice a week, and will sit alongside a new Australian teen soap. There will be repeats, branded as half-hour Harchester United TV (a spoof on MUTV), running this summer. In between, Hewland International, her production company, is making a BBC Worldwide educational drama, called Goal, for foreign students of English, using football as bait. And ITV has paid her a compliment by commissioning its own series, Footballers' Wives - from the team behind the sensational Bad Girls. \"There'll be as much football in it as there was oil in Dallas,\" growls Nick Elliott, ITV's drama controller and another LWT multimillionaire. Hewland has also just landed a 13-hour drama order from Sky One, for Mile High, about the raunchy antics of air hostesses, due for screening in early 2002. \"The top factual shows are Airport and Airline, and they can't show what really goes on. We were onto drunken pilots ages ago,\" she observes with a happy smile. Hewland has a reputation for being creative, highly intelligent and ahead of the game, but a little wacky - and not just because she walked away from \u00a39-10m in March 1990. \"She's a very, very bright woman, and dangerously fearless,\" observes Elliott. \"The thing was,\" says Hewland, \"I was too stupid. I realised later that if I had got them to sack me, I would have kept the shares. I got nothing out of it. God, I don't mind. It's very weird, you get to a certain age [she was 40 then], it's nothing to do with talent, but there are periods of your life when nothing you touch works. I'd worked incredibly happily up to that point.\" Greg Dyke, then her LWT boss, had made her controller of current affairs in 1988 but it hadn't worked out. \"I hugely admire Greg but I guess I was a John Birt person, brought up through that system.\" Last year was another iffy period. She failed to win an ITV soap commission with her ideas about flashy Essex millionaires. And under Sky One's general manager, David Bergg, the hotshot scheduler lured from ITV, Dream Team faced the axe. But it was Bergg who walked the plank. \"The spirit there [at Sky One] is just so different now,\" says Hewland. \"For the past year, we've been dealing with a bunch of completely confused people trying to put the best face on it, all trying desperately to defend their corner. But now everyone is relaxed and happy, it is back to the basics, Sky as it was in 1997 [when Dream Team, commissioned by Lis Murdoch, began]. I know it is much harder for them now that Channel 4 has got its act together on the entertainment side, but the way forward is to offer a version of the [brash] Fox network.\" As for David Bergg's vision of Sky One, appealing to the Sunny Delight ITV family audience? \"I really don't think there is any point in trying to be another ITV or BBC because Sky hasn't got the money. Audiences go to BBC first, then ITV, so why go to Sky? Also, what did you think about Harry Enfield going to Sky? For audiences it's like, 'So that's the only one which would have him.' It's counterproductive,\" she says. \"Whereas if you start with something that's your own brand, that you build, then you've got something to offer - cult viewing which people know they can't get anywhere else. It was that way with Ibiza Uncovered, Prickly Heat, and The Simpsons and Friends, before they were flogged elsewhere. \"I never took Mile High near David Bergg. He didn't want long-running series. I was arguing that with BBC and ITV news both going to 10 pm we had a gift. We have to go in there and try and clean up with long-running brands, particularly on Sky because people sample it only when the terrestrial channels don't satisfy.\" The evening before our interview Hewland dipped back into her earlier cerebral life: she was at the House of Lords for a recorded brainstorming session called by Lord [John] Birt. He's writing his memoirs and has reached 1972/73 and the famed creation of Weekend World and its \"mission to explain\". \"Weekend World was a fantastic education for everyone who worked on it, and that's shown by the fact that they've gone out and run the rest of British television. Whether it was at all significant for the audience I can't tell. It was like a giant university compound for the media establishment,\" she says. By 1987, when Birt went to the BBC, she'd already joined forces with Janet Street-Porter to create the slick Network 7, for Channel 4, the foundation of the \"yoof\" programming genre. \"The first person to do anything is a fool, because they always fuck up. Then everyone else comes along. Network 7 is the only thing I've done where being first worked.\" As for being a businesswoman? \"It has taken me 10 years to learn how I should have started. First of all, I didn't have a partner. You have to have somebody to bat ideas about. I had this huge wake-up call last year. There was a TV discussion where David Baddiel said he'd got 13 hours of television from Sky One and Lynda La Plante flipped, saying: 'How can people like you get 13 hours? I have to beg for four.' I thought: 'Oh my God, I am looking at what I can become.' I tend to be very hands on. But then you are limited to what you yourself can do. I'm aiming to be a proper businesswoman.\" The inspiration for her best ideas, she says, comes from her son, Harry, now at Edinburgh University, whose father is Nick Evans (author of The Horse Whisperer). Hewland secured her company finances in the early 1990s with Channel 4's Gamesmaster, the first series to catch the video games mania: \"Being a mother inspired me.\" In December 1990, she bought a Nintendo set with robot and laser, as specified by her son, and played duck hunt. \"I thought: 'Bloody hell, this could be good television.'\" Dream Team and her interest in football sprang from Harry, though the format was conjured up in one brief exchange with ex-Sky executive David Hill, now running Fox.

      "body": "<p>Political journalists are most interested in sleaze and scandal, and are bored by policy. That has been the consistent complaint of this government, and John Major's for that matter. So how true is it? </p> <p>Romeike Media Intelligence, a Swedish media monitoring company which has covered a succession of elections in Scandinavia and Germany, has just begun an in-depth survey of the news priorities of our newspapers at the start of the UK campaign. Its first assessment is based on data from January 11 to February 14. It shouldn't be taken as comprehensive, and some of its work betrays a certain innocence about Westminster, but it still provides some interesting data. </p> <p>The firm's methodology is straightforward. It includes all the dailies and Sundays, plus the Evening Standard, the Spectator and the New Statesman. It takes the two top-placed political stories in each publication - which after all is probably how most casual readers glean their information and make their judgments. Commentaries and leader articles are excluded. It bases its assessment on a strict textual analysis of each piece. The grades go from +1, the most positive coverage possible, down in decimal points to -1 (awful). Zero is neutral. According to its calculations, headlines count for half the impact of a story, a reasonable assumption. </p> <p>This was the period dominated by Peter Mandelson's resignation. In that time, Labour had nearly twice as much coverage - about 450 stories - against the Conservatives' 250. However, the overall impact on Labour was worse, at around -0.3, according to Romeike's scale. The Tories went just into negative, at around -0.1, which for an opposition at this stage of the political cycle is unimpressive. As for the Liberal Democrats, they rarely wavered from the neutral line, because they were mentioned so rarely. </p> <p>On sheer number of mentions, sleaze was way out ahead, being the main theme in about 130 of the most eye-catching stories that month; election campaign coverage was about half that, followed by the EU (Tony Blair admitting the two-year euro deadline), then internal party machinations and, behind that, tax at about 50 stories. </p> <p>As for the issues that cast each of the parties in a good or bad light, there were interesting findings that seem to confirm the perceptions in each of the party headquarters. For the Tories, tax easily played best, with education and immigration helping them only marginally. Tellingly, they gained little benefit from stories on sleaze, Europe, the health service, or the election campaign. </p> <p>For Labour, education was streets ahead (this was the period just preceding the announcements on specialist schools, and Alastair Campbell's \"bog standard comprehensives\" comments). Every other issue caused a problem. Sleaze was terrible all round - close to the worst possible rating of -1. Health was only marginally difficult, with immigration, defence, tax and the EU all having a stronger negative impact. </p> <p>This first batch of statistics gives some early clues about the way the campaign proper will be covered. First, news coverage reinforces negative perceptions about politicians and politics in general. It is extremely hard to get a \"good news\" story running for any length of time. Second, unlike the 1997 campaign, Labour will not find it easy to dictate which stories should run throughout the day. Third, the Conservatives are still struggling to match Labour in terms of quantity of top stories. </p> <p>And while, overall, the balance of the top stories appears slanted towards them, it doesn't seem to be enough of a gap to make a significant impact on undecided voters. Fourth, William Hague is quoted three times as often in Tory-related stories as Tony Blair is in Labour ones, suggesting that the prime minister might be less of a control freak than the leader of the opposition. And fifth, the Liberal Democrats are getting nowhere.

      "bodyText": "Political journalists are most interested in sleaze and scandal, and are bored by policy. That has been the consistent complaint of this government, and John Major's for that matter. So how true is it? Romeike Media Intelligence, a Swedish media monitoring company which has covered a succession of elections in Scandinavia and Germany, has just begun an in-depth survey of the news priorities of our newspapers at the start of the UK campaign. Its first assessment is based on data from January 11 to February 14. It shouldn't be taken as comprehensive, and some of its work betrays a certain innocence about Westminster, but it still provides some interesting data. The firm's methodology is straightforward. It includes all the dailies and Sundays, plus the Evening Standard, the Spectator and the New Statesman. It takes the two top-placed political stories in each publication - which after all is probably how most casual readers glean their information and make their judgments. Commentaries and leader articles are excluded. It bases its assessment on a strict textual analysis of each piece. The grades go from +1, the most positive coverage possible, down in decimal points to -1 (awful). Zero is neutral. According to its calculations, headlines count for half the impact of a story, a reasonable assumption. This was the period dominated by Peter Mandelson's resignation. In that time, Labour had nearly twice as much coverage - about 450 stories - against the Conservatives' 250. However, the overall impact on Labour was worse, at around -0.3, according to Romeike's scale. The Tories went just into negative, at around -0.1, which for an opposition at this stage of the political cycle is unimpressive. As for the Liberal Democrats, they rarely wavered from the neutral line, because they were mentioned so rarely. On sheer number of mentions, sleaze was way out ahead, being the main theme in about 130 of the most eye-catching stories that month; election campaign coverage was about half that, followed by the EU (Tony Blair admitting the two-year euro deadline), then internal party machinations and, behind that, tax at about 50 stories. As for the issues that cast each of the parties in a good or bad light, there were interesting findings that seem to confirm the perceptions in each of the party headquarters. For the Tories, tax easily played best, with education and immigration helping them only marginally. Tellingly, they gained little benefit from stories on sleaze, Europe, the health service, or the election campaign. For Labour, education was streets ahead (this was the period just preceding the announcements on specialist schools, and Alastair Campbell's \"bog standard comprehensives\" comments). Every other issue caused a problem. Sleaze was terrible all round - close to the worst possible rating of -1. Health was only marginally difficult, with immigration, defence, tax and the EU all having a stronger negative impact. This first batch of statistics gives some early clues about the way the campaign proper will be covered. First, news coverage reinforces negative perceptions about politicians and politics in general. It is extremely hard to get a \"good news\" story running for any length of time. Second, unlike the 1997 campaign, Labour will not find it easy to dictate which stories should run throughout the day. Third, the Conservatives are still struggling to match Labour in terms of quantity of top stories. And while, overall, the balance of the top stories appears slanted towards them, it doesn't seem to be enough of a gap to make a significant impact on undecided voters. Fourth, William Hague is quoted three times as often in Tory-related stories as Tony Blair is in Labour ones, suggesting that the prime minister might be less of a control freak than the leader of the opposition. And fifth, the Liberal Democrats are getting nowhere. Their main contribution over this period was for Norman Baker to hasten Mandelson's demise - something the party leadership in Cowley Street now rues. Perhaps the most glaring conclusion is that all the negative coverage for Labour hasn't made the blindest bit of difference in the polls. What does that say about the impact of newspaper front pages?",

But that is exactly how a new advertising campaign from foods giant Unilever is being billed by its creators. The new campaign, for Olivio spread and Colman's sauces, is to be the first interactive campaign to appear on ITV - and it is being described as the coming-of-age of interactive advertising. </p> <p>Interactive advertising has already spawned more first-to-market claims than even the most diligent industry observer can remember. We've had the first interactive car ad, the first interactive ad you can play games on and the first interactive ad for a charity. But most have been restricted to niche channels, so for Britain's biggest commercial broadcaster to get in on the act is a milestone. </p> <p>The campaign is the result of a deal between Unilever and Carlton. Jane Marshall, chief executive of Carlton's interactive operation Carlton Active, helped put the deal together. \"It's about finding ways to add extra value to advertisers,\" she says. \"Our audience research shows that viewers have been interacting with services like Teletext for years so they're comfortable with the idea.\" </p> <p>What does an interactive advertising campaign actually look like? The answer, initially, is much like a normal advert. Unilever is using its standard commercials for Olivio and Colmans, so anyone watching on a standard TV will not notice any difference. </p> <p>But anyone watching on interactive digital television or with an ONdigital box will see a strip appear on screen saying that the ad is interactive. By pressing a button on their remote control they can shrink the broadcast ad to a box that fills a quarter of the screen, with the rest of the space dedicated to interactive content. Advertisers will then entice the viewer with product promotions, recipe ideas, competitions - anything to get them thinking of the product they are trying to sell. The idea is that the advertiser gets the viewer's attention for several minutes rather than just for the 30-second slot they've paid for. </p> <p>Unilever has been something of a pioneer of interactive advertising. The UK's first interactive commercial, broadcast last March, was for its Chicken Tonight brand, and the company has set up its own portal, called the Creative Kitchen, on Sky's Open service. Users can order recipes and money-off vouchers and take part in quizzes and prize competitions. Meanwhile, Unilever can gather information about the user's habits and preferences. </p> <p>Advocates of interactive ads insist they are much more effective than ordinary commercials. Ian Kenny, digital communications director at Ogilvy, the agency behind Unilever's interactive advertising campaign, says, \"Our research shows the Chicken Tonight campaign was 70% more effective than the average direct response TV campaign [with a phone number viewers can call] and the rate of redemption from the voucher was four times higher than average. That could be put down to novelty value, but further campaigns have achieved similar results.\" </p> <p>But even Kenny admits that advertising agencies will have to come up with something pretty entertaining if they are to continue to lure viewers away from the programmes they are watching. \"At the moment it's a direct marketing exercise but we will see much more sophisticated content coming through,\" he says. \"Companies could put together short films and viewers will soon be able to bookmark ads, so they can come back to it once the programme has finished.\" </p> <p>But not all advertisers are convinced that interactive TV is a good thing. The Abbey National last week said it would cut its TV advertising budget after research showed many digital viewers use the commercial break to do their banking or shopping, skipping the ads altogether. </p> <p>With so much competition for consumers' attention, advertisers have to work pretty hard to keep people listening to their message.</p>",

Tonight in Earls Court, the great and the good of the British music industry will grace the annual Brit Awards, but to see it on TV, you'll have to wait until tomorrow. </p> <p>Since 1985, the Brits have traditionally been shown on TV the night after the ceremony. Back then, a disastrous pairing of Sam Fox and Mick Fleetwood, as co-hosts, put paid to the idea that a live show would work in front of a TV audience.</p> <p> But tonight the first live pictures of the Brits in 16 years will be transmitted - only this time, they will be on the internet. <br> Tonight's exclusively online show will feature the presentation of the four key awards; Best UK artist, Best International artist, Best Female and Best Male artist. For the rest, the Brits have hired Kate Thornton to loiter backstage and catch the winners after they've collected their prizes. Four webcams will be placed in the backstage and entrance areas - even Brandon Block, the hapless DJ who gained notoriety for last year's fracas with Ronnie Wood, will meet and greet the stars. As an online show, its makers claim, it will have a level of access that TV has never enjoyed. </p> <p>This is the first time the Brits have used the internet to show live video. It's an ambitious plan that led the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) to sign a two-year partnership deal with Done &amp; Dusted, the production company that brought us the record-shattering Madonna webcast from the Brixton Academy last November. </p> <p> Not so long ago production crews like Done &amp; Dusted were a set of hired guns you'd get in to televise your event, but the coming of interactive entertainment is changing that. Now a company such as Done &amp; Dusted is more like the driving force. No longer does it merely film the pictures, it offers to manage an event's commercial opportunities. </p> <p> Although the Brits designs its own site and manages the content, the webcast is very much Done &amp; Dusted's show. \"The last thing we wanted was to produce another TV programme,\" says Paul Morrison, the company's managing director. \"If you want TV, then watch TV. What we offer is a non-linear interactive experience.\" </p> <p> Done &amp; Dusted was formed three years ago by Hamish Hamilton, who will also direct tomorrow night's TV show on ITV. </p> <p> Last year he was joined by Morrison, the former MD of the large marketing company that put Virgin into the V2000. This combination of editorial skill and commercial acumen, they say, is helping Done &amp; Dusted forge a new role for production companies. \"We're an events-driven broadcasting company with a commercial arm,\" explains Morrison. </p> <p> Hamilton directed his first large-scale webcast two years ago. The company filmed Robbie Williams in Slaine Castle in Ireland in front of 100,000 people. But it sharpened its teeth last summer on the festival circuit and last year it claimed to have filmed more than 300 artists as it brought the likes of V2000 and Creamfields to computer screens. The company has also produced concerts for Sky's interactive service. </p> <p> Although ambitious, this year's Brit Awards is still a trial run. But with the contract for the TV rights due to expire this year, a full-blown Brit Awards, live on the internet, could be not far away. If tonight's webcast is successful, something like a full show could be here by next year. \"We've got to respect the role that television needs to play in this,\" says Adrian Pettett, who gave up his job as publisher of Loaded to join Done &amp; Dusted. \"The TV broadcast goes out in 67 other countries, but we are able to give people an as-near-as-damn-it experience. But the key thing with the internet is that it doesn't matter where you are, be it Tokyo, New York or Paignton in Devon. It's going out on the night live. It's not pre-edited, it's not polished or shiny. But it's interactive, you can choose which camera to watch. It's not the full show live, not yet. But this is only year one.\" </p> <p> To reach a global audience, the Brits and Done &amp; Dusted needed a global player, so The Microsoft Network (MSN), which also worked with Madonna, was brought in on a similar two-year deal. Although the Brits has its own site, <a href=\"http://www.brits.co.uk\">brits.co.uk</a>, to reach a global audience from one concert you need a company with a massive reach and a marketing clout to match. </p> <p> \"The trouble with the TV footage is that you have to wait and get it edited,\" says Tracy Blatcher, marketing manager for MSN. \"The juicy bits are taken out. But we're not going to edit anything. It will be far more exciting because people don't know what the results are going to be, we won't have a chance to read the papers.\" </p> <p> Madonna's gig received 4.5m consecutive streams during the concert, rising to 10.8m over the two-week period following the show. For the Brits, MSN has promoted the event with a 160m banner advertisements, about the same number it gave to Paul McCartney's 1999 Cavern Club concert. MSN will carry the Brits on 24 of its sites worldwide. It predicts that nearly 2m will watch some element of the Brits online. </p> <p> \"Madonna changed things,\" adds Pettett. \"It changed perceptions about the value of working online. Madonna's sales of her album went up by 86% in the week after the show.\" </p> <p> The BPI clearly hopes to generate similar revenues by putting the Brits online and has signed a deal with Amazon, which paid an undisclosed six-figure sum to become the Brits etail partner. The Brits, a registered charity, will also receive a bounty for every CD purchased when clicked through from the site. Revenue has also been raised through selling SMS rights to the event. BT Cellnet paid another undisclosed six-figure sum. Users will be able to vote via text messages for the first time. This allows record companies to appeal directly to the fans. Further syndication rights are also in the offing. </p> <p>Which all leads to the rare case of an entertainment website that's making money. The plan next is to convert the official site into a year-round music portal. Especially as it looks as if an online Brits could be profitable. Already, the Classical Brits are held in June, and a number of other award ceremonies tied to the brand are rumoured to be in the pipeline. </p> <p> \"Brands know that their traditional TV advertising isn't really working. But big events like the Madonna gig allow kids to feel part of something, and going online makes them part of a community,\" says Morrison. </p> <p> For the BPI, hosting a virtual award ceremony with strong commercial potential is the best way of putting on a united front after a period of deep unease over the internet. \"A few years ago the record industry was cagey, nervous and threatened by the internet,\" says a spokesperson for the Brits. \"But now its seems to have absorbed most of the adverse effects and is trying to expand into new media. I suppose this online show is part of that.\" </p> <p> But for the Brits, and especially for Done &amp; Dusted, it's about setting new standards, and breaking more records. For them, the audience for online entertainment is not restricted by appetite, only by bandwidth.</p>",

Last year he was joined by Morrison, the former MD of the large marketing company that put Virgin into the V2000. This combination of editorial skill and commercial acumen, they say, is helping Done &amp; Dusted forge a new role for production companies. \"We're an events-driven broadcasting company with a commercial arm,\" explains Morrison. Hamilton directed his first large-scale webcast two years ago. The company filmed Robbie Williams in Slaine Castle in Ireland in front of 100,000 people. But it sharpened its teeth last summer on the festival circuit and last year it claimed to have filmed more than 300 artists as it brought the likes of V2000 and Creamfields to computer screens. The company has also produced concerts for Sky's interactive service. Although ambitious, this year's Brit Awards is still a trial run. But with the contract for the TV rights due to expire this year, a full-blown Brit Awards, live on the internet, could be not far away. If tonight's webcast is successful, something like a full show could be here by next year. \"We've got to respect the role that television needs to play in this,\" says Adrian Pettett, who gave up his job as publisher of Loaded to join Done &amp; Dusted. \"The TV broadcast goes out in 67 other countries, but we are able to give people an as-near-as-damn-it experience. But the key thing with the internet is that it doesn't matter where you are, be it Tokyo, New York or Paignton in Devon. It's going out on the night live. It's not pre-edited, it's not polished or shiny. But it's interactive, you can choose which camera to watch. It's not the full show live, not yet. But this is only year one.\" To reach a global audience, the Brits and Done &amp; Dusted needed a global player, so The Microsoft Network (MSN), which also worked with Madonna, was brought in on a similar two-year deal. Although the Brits has its own site, brits.co.uk, to reach a global audience from one concert you need a company with a massive reach and a marketing clout to match. \"The trouble with the TV footage is that you have to wait and get it edited,\" says Tracy Blatcher, marketing manager for MSN. \"The juicy bits are taken out. But we're not going to edit anything. It will be far more exciting because people don't know what the results are going to be, we won't have a chance to read the papers.\" Madonna's gig received 4.5m consecutive streams during the concert, rising to 10.8m over the two-week period following the show. For the Brits, MSN has promoted the event with a 160m banner advertisements, about the same number it gave to Paul McCartney's 1999 Cavern Club concert. MSN will carry the Brits on 24 of its sites worldwide. It predicts that nearly 2m will watch some element of the Brits online. \"Madonna changed things,\" adds Pettett. \"It changed perceptions about the value of working online. Madonna's sales of her album went up by 86% in the week after the show.\" The BPI clearly hopes to generate similar revenues by putting the Brits online and has signed a deal with Amazon, which paid an undisclosed six-figure sum to become the Brits etail partner. The Brits, a registered charity, will also receive a bounty for every CD purchased when clicked through from the site. Revenue has also been raised through selling SMS rights to the event. BT Cellnet paid another undisclosed six-figure sum. Users will be able to vote via text messages for the first time. This allows record companies to appeal directly to the fans. Further syndication rights are also in the offing. Which all leads to the rare case of an entertainment website that's making money. The plan next is to convert the official site into a year-round music portal. Especially as it looks as if an online Brits could be profitable. Already, the Classical Brits are held in June, and a number of other award ceremonies tied to the brand are rumoured to be in the pipeline. \"Brands know that their traditional TV advertising isn't really working. But big events like the Madonna gig allow kids to feel part of something, and going online makes them part of a community,\" says Morrison. For the BPI, hosting a virtual award ceremony with strong commercial potential is the best way of putting on a united front after a period of deep unease over the internet. \"A few years ago the record industry was cagey, nervous and threatened by the internet,\" says a spokesperson for the Brits. \"But now its seems to have absorbed most of the adverse effects and is trying to expand into new media. I suppose this online show is part of that.\" But for the Brits, and especially for Done &amp; Dusted, it's about setting new standards, and breaking more records. For them, the audience for online entertainment is not restricted by appetite, only by bandwidth.",

      "body": "<p>The Guardian's constant critique of capitalism is that it does not encourage enough long-term investment. Press Holdings, owners of the Scotsman group of newspapers in Edinburgh and Sunday Business in London, eschews quick returns, takes a long-term horizon and invests big in its newspapers. So you might think we would warrant a small plaudit from the Guardian. No chance. </p> <p>Instead, its financial editor, Paul Murphy, unleashes a diatribe of distortion, untruths and sheer malevolence masquerading as serious analysis. Even by the notoriously bitchy and inaccurate standards of contemporary media journalism, he set a new record. He found it \"extraordinary\" that the Scotsman should hold a presentation in London, \"several hundred miles away\" from its market, depicting it as an unnecessary extravagance in the \"fussy, expensive\" Dorchester Hotel. In fact, 60% of the Scotsman's revenues from display advertising are now booked through the London agencies. </p> <p>We had already briefed the Scottish media community about the remarkable success of the paper's relaunch, with sales over 100,000 for the first time in its 183-year history. Now we were in London to spread the same good news. </p> <p>Since its relaunch last May, the Scotsman has outsold the tartan editions of all the London broadsheets combined, which makes the London ad agencies a very important constituency for us. We are aiming for a substantial rise in London revenues on the back of our increased sales. So there was nothing \"extraordinary\" about our presentation to them. </p> <p>Murphy claims that when I became publisher of Press Holdings in 1999, I took a \"punishing attitude to costs\" and \"slashed\" budgets \"across the board\" in Edinburgh. This is fantasy financial journalism, the opposite of the truth. Costs rose overall by 8% in 1999, and by a further 11% in 2000. Within these overall increases, editorial budgets increased by \u00a31m in 1999, and another \u00a31m in 2000. Promotional spending on our three Edinburgh titles similarly soared by \u00a31m for each of these two years. </p> <p>Since I became editor-in-chief in 1996, editorial budgets on our three Scottish titles have increased by 50%, and promotional spend by more than 100%. Some cuts! Some punishment! Despite this substantial investment, sales of the Scotsman continued their long-term decline. So last spring we decided on a radical makeover of the paper and a price-cutting strategy to introduce the new Scotsman to new readers. The result is a 33% rise in sales and a 15% increase in advertising revenues. No newspaper in the land can match this double whammy. </p> <p>Murphy remains in fantasyland when he turns his bile on Sunday Business. The charge is that I cavalierly doubled the price of Sunday Business to \u00a31, yet refused to give the price rise any promotional back up, so sales collapsed. Wrong on all counts. As a small-circulation, upmarket niche product, the paper was underpriced at 50p; as I said at the time of the price rise in February 2000, if we could not make it work at \u00a31 then we did not have a business. A \u00a3500,000 TV and direct mail campaign supported the price rise. This was money well spent. </p> <p>Audited sales of Sunday Business in the six months after we went to \u00a31 averaged 67,000 - an increase of 5,500 on the six months before the price rise (bulks were the same in both periods). To double the price of a newspaper and increase sales by nearly 10% is a remarkable achievement, unprecedented in British publishing. These figures are a matter of public record. </p> <p>The gentle slide in sales happened long after the price rise. By early last autumn, it was clear that sales were not returning by enough from the usual summer downturn, a trend which was not reversed by another \u00a3250,000 promotional spend in October. </p> <p>I had already concluded during the summer that the paper needed to be refreshed and taken to the next stage of its development with a relaunch. But the editor, Jeff Randall, informed me that he was leaving to join the BBC early in the new year. I had no choice but to postpone the relaunch until then, with a new editor and a reinvigorated paper. </p> <p>We are in the process of revamping section one with improved comment and analysis, inventing a new investment section to replace the existing section two, and developing a colour magazine. The new package will be unveiled on March 11, supported by a major TV, radio and direct mail campaign. </p> <p>We are confident that the relaunch of Sunday Business will be as successful as the relaunch of the Scotsman. But Murphy claims that our owners are throwing many millions into a publishing black hole, with no prospect of return. We are grateful for his concern but it is uninformed. The Scotsman Group has made healthy profits every year since the Barclay family bought it in 1996. We could have made even more if we had screwed down budgets for short-term gain, as the previous owners had done. But we are fortunate in having owners who believe in investing in their titles for the long term. </p> <p>It is a strategy that has already built asset value: the Scotsman Group and Sunday Business are already worth far more than the sums invested in them. As we build on our Scottish successes, and invest further in Sunday Business, the value of our papers will rise further. As a private company, long-term asset value matters more than short-term profit. </p> <p>Why the Guardian would devote a page-one puff, a cover story and a two-page spread to a small, niche publisher is a mystery. Why it would choose the most unflattering picture of me it could find to illustrate the two-page diatribe - it was blown up to make it look as if my eyes had been nibbled out by Hannibal Lecter - is a further mystery. </p> <p>But the biggest mystery of all is why the Guardian would publish a blatant attempt to drive a wedge between my proprietors and me. Whatever the motive, it has failed. The Guardian's desire to come between us and do us down, simply makes us even more determined to succeed.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The arch-rival owners of the Daily Mail and the Daily Express have called a truce in their dogfight just as it was getting dirty, it emerged yesterday. </p> <p>After Richard Desmond's Express spent most of last week raking over the personal lives of the Rothermere family, the Mail has run up the white flag. It is understood that the wife of the Mail owner, Lord Rothermere, could not stomach the increasingly personal attacks in the rival paper. </p> <p>The Mail has agreed not to brand Mr Desmond a pornographer (he has interests in the Fantasy Channel and a string of pornographic magazines and websites) as long as the Express calls a halt to the muck-raking.

      "bodyText": "The arch-rival owners of the Daily Mail and the Daily Express have called a truce in their dogfight just as it was getting dirty, it emerged yesterday. After Richard Desmond's Express spent most of last week raking over the personal lives of the Rothermere family, the Mail has run up the white flag. It is understood that the wife of the Mail owner, Lord Rothermere, could not stomach the increasingly personal attacks in the rival paper. The Mail has agreed not to brand Mr Desmond a pornographer (he has interests in the Fantasy Channel and a string of pornographic magazines and websites) as long as the Express calls a halt to the muck-raking. The Express camp is jubilant: the Mail blinked first. The climbdown came after an acrimonious campaign of commercial and editorial mud-slinging. The Mail had launched a particularly robust promotion to attract Express readers after Mr Desmond bought the title last November. It gave away copies of the Mail to Express readers, with a mock wraparound front cover detailing the sleazier side of Mr Desmond's business interests and featuring a picture of a 78-year-old woman from one of his porn websites. It also offered retailers \u00a35 for each Express reader who switched to the Mail - an expensive and ruthless operation. The Daily Express, under a new editor, Chris Williams, responded with a series of articles last week about the Rothermere dynasty, which has controlled the Mail since it began in 1896. In a double-page spread, written anonymously, it detailed the first Lord Rothermere's support of fascism in the 1930s, and attacked the third Lord Rothermere's infidelity. The Express then highlighted the story of the current Lord Rothermere's illegitimate child, a revelation that first appeared in Punch magazine two years ago but received little further coverage at the time. This story, according to reports yesterday, particularly upset Lord Rothermere's wife, Claudia. A meeting was arranged at the Howard hotel in London between Murdoch MacLennan, the managing director of Associated Newspapers, parent company of the Mail, and Mr Desmond. A gentlemen's agreement was reached which means that the newspapers will not engage in any more personal attacks on proprietors. The bitter circulation war will continue, though. The Express is heavily promoting its links with Mr Desmond's OK! magazine, while Hello!, OK!'s rival, has joined up with the Mail. And it seems likely that the Express will continue its attacks on the Mail's editorial content - under a piece headlined Hate Mail last week, it ran a series of anti-Mail quotes from prominent personalities. It is a tough battle: the Mail's circulation rose to 2.48m a day in January, while the Express, once the dominant player in the middle market, is trailing at below 1m.",

      "body": "<p>It is 10.19pm when the party leader rises to make his speech to parliament. When he sits down, the clock has moved on to 10.20pm. There is total silence. It is broken only by the sound of an orgasmic stage-whispered scream of approval from the balcony: \"Yessssssssss!\" It is coming from the leader's speechwriter: \"He did it! He did it! To the second! One minute 30 seconds precisely. Perfect!\" By now the next speaker is already on his feet. He is greeted with silence too. Silence is the characteristic response to speeches here, especially when it is well past dinner time in the best city for eating out in Europe.</p> <p>This is the European parliament in Strasbourg, where the debate - on the harmonisation of laws relating to food supplements - is being attended by precisely 17 of the 626 parliamentarians, plus 18 members of staff, eight people in the public galleries and 33 interpreters (three for each of the European Union's 11 official languages). The vast and stunning egg-shaped chamber is lit for the occasion by enough wattage to illuminate a fair-sized third world capital.</p> <p>The strict time limit is one of the mercies. Hence the speechwriter's delight: a fraction longer than the allotted 90 seconds and the microphone would have been switched off. But the silence that greeted this particular leader's speech was more than normally profound.</p> <p>The speaker was Jeffrey Titford of the UK Independence party, which - according to its 7% win of the vote in the 1999 European elections - is the fourth-largest party in Britain. (The big four party leaders are thus Tony Blair, William Hague, Charles Kennedy and Titford.) It is also the only one of the dozens of parties represented in this place totally committed to withdrawal from the EU. Titford was against harmonisation, surprisingly enough, arguing that British law was perfectly adequate. He's always against. He is the clergyman addressing the sinners in the whorehouse. Or Lucifer in the cathedral, depending on your point of view.</p> <p>Somewhere between a half and three-fifths of Britain's electorate agree with Titford that Britain should seek an amicable divorce from the EU, and in 1999 Ukip (pronounced you-kip) won three MEPs. However, the former party leader, Michael Holmes, has not been sighted in almost a year, partly through ill-health, partly through disaffection. He is rumoured to be on the brink of joining the Greens, leaving just Titford and his sidekick, Nigel Farage.</p> <p>Holmes's disappearance is merely one strand in a skein of vituperation and hatred that characterises Ukip. Earlier this month, the party's founder, Dr Alan Sked, claimed in the Spectator that the party was now enmeshed with the extreme right. The front page advertised \"Ukip and the fascists\".</p> <p>Sked's evidence seemed slender. Much rested on a meeting between Farage and a party member who also belonged to the openly racist British National party. Farage says this was someone recruited by Sked, and that the meeting was to tell the man he was unwanted. If there was serious evidence linking the party with racists, at least 600 people in Strasbourg would be delighted to use it. But even Chris Huhne, the Liberal Democrat MEP who is one of their sternest critics, admits: \"They're not fascists, they're not corrupt and they're not morons. Some of their members are headbangers, though.\"</p> <p>They certainly are. The party's Scottish organiser has just been kicked off the executive for a year after questioning, in letters to newspapers, the extent of the Holocaust. Farage claims Ukip is the victim of \"entryism\". For what it's worth, the two men sit dead-centre of the parliament's semi-circle, close to the Lib Dems but at the back: traditional refuge of the most truculent members of any class. They are in a loose alliance known as EDD (Europe of Democracy and Diversities): a ragbag of 16 anti-federalists, comprising six French rustics, four Danes, three Dutch Calvinist ministers and the two Britons, but not rightwingers such as Jean-Marie Le Pen.</p> <p>Even in the EDD, the Britons are out on a limb. Farage and Titford want Britain out, plain and simple. Thus John Bowis, the former Tory minister who is now an MEP, can say: \"They are a tiny, tiny extreme element of a fringe part of the parliament. I just think they're irrelevant.\" But they may be very relevant in many rural constituencies come the general election. And they do at least have a coherent position - unlike the Tories, whose representatives here are horribly split.</p> <p>Ukip, however, is an incoherent party, and its internal schisms are certainly worthy of the far right. It was founded in 1993 by Sked, a lecturer at the London School of Economics, and bumbled on quietly until the 1997 election, when it was totally swamped in the anti-Europe market by Jimmy Goldsmith's big-money, high-profile Referendum party. Then Goldsmith died, leaving a vacuum which Ukip filled with vicious infighting. But at the 1999 European elections, it was suddenly well-placed to pick up protest votes.

      "bodyText": "It is 10.19pm when the party leader rises to make his speech to parliament. When he sits down, the clock has moved on to 10.20pm. There is total silence. It is broken only by the sound of an orgasmic stage-whispered scream of approval from the balcony: \"Yessssssssss!\" It is coming from the leader's speechwriter: \"He did it! He did it! To the second! One minute 30 seconds precisely. Perfect!\" By now the next speaker is already on his feet. He is greeted with silence too. Silence is the characteristic response to speeches here, especially when it is well past dinner time in the best city for eating out in Europe. This is the European parliament in Strasbourg, where the debate - on the harmonisation of laws relating to food supplements - is being attended by precisely 17 of the 626 parliamentarians, plus 18 members of staff, eight people in the public galleries and 33 interpreters (three for each of the European Union's 11 official languages). The vast and stunning egg-shaped chamber is lit for the occasion by enough wattage to illuminate a fair-sized third world capital. The strict time limit is one of the mercies. Hence the speechwriter's delight: a fraction longer than the allotted 90 seconds and the microphone would have been switched off. But the silence that greeted this particular leader's speech was more than normally profound. The speaker was Jeffrey Titford of the UK Independence party, which - according to its 7% win of the vote in the 1999 European elections - is the fourth-largest party in Britain. (The big four party leaders are thus Tony Blair, William Hague, Charles Kennedy and Titford.) It is also the only one of the dozens of parties represented in this place totally committed to withdrawal from the EU. Titford was against harmonisation, surprisingly enough, arguing that British law was perfectly adequate. He's always against. He is the clergyman addressing the sinners in the whorehouse. Or Lucifer in the cathedral, depending on your point of view. Somewhere between a half and three-fifths of Britain's electorate agree with Titford that Britain should seek an amicable divorce from the EU, and in 1999 Ukip (pronounced you-kip) won three MEPs. However, the former party leader, Michael Holmes, has not been sighted in almost a year, partly through ill-health, partly through disaffection. He is rumoured to be on the brink of joining the Greens, leaving just Titford and his sidekick, Nigel Farage. Holmes's disappearance is merely one strand in a skein of vituperation and hatred that characterises Ukip. Earlier this month, the party's founder, Dr Alan Sked, claimed in the Spectator that the party was now enmeshed with the extreme right. The front page advertised \"Ukip and the fascists\". Sked's evidence seemed slender. Much rested on a meeting between Farage and a party member who also belonged to the openly racist British National party. Farage says this was someone recruited by Sked, and that the meeting was to tell the man he was unwanted. If there was serious evidence linking the party with racists, at least 600 people in Strasbourg would be delighted to use it. But even Chris Huhne, the Liberal Democrat MEP who is one of their sternest critics, admits: \"They're not fascists, they're not corrupt and they're not morons. Some of their members are headbangers, though.\" They certainly are. The party's Scottish organiser has just been kicked off the executive for a year after questioning, in letters to newspapers, the extent of the Holocaust. Farage claims Ukip is the victim of \"entryism\". For what it's worth, the two men sit dead-centre of the parliament's semi-circle, close to the Lib Dems but at the back: traditional refuge of the most truculent members of any class. They are in a loose alliance known as EDD (Europe of Democracy and Diversities): a ragbag of 16 anti-federalists, comprising six French rustics, four Danes, three Dutch Calvinist ministers and the two Britons, but not rightwingers such as Jean-Marie Le Pen. Even in the EDD, the Britons are out on a limb. Farage and Titford want Britain out, plain and simple. Thus John Bowis, the former Tory minister who is now an MEP, can say: \"They are a tiny, tiny extreme element of a fringe part of the parliament. I just think they're irrelevant.\" But they may be very relevant in many rural constituencies come the general election. And they do at least have a coherent position - unlike the Tories, whose representatives here are horribly split. Ukip, however, is an incoherent party, and its internal schisms are certainly worthy of the far right. It was founded in 1993 by Sked, a lecturer at the London School of Economics, and bumbled on quietly until the 1997 election, when it was totally swamped in the anti-Europe market by Jimmy Goldsmith's big-money, high-profile Referendum party. Then Goldsmith died, leaving a vacuum which Ukip filled with vicious infighting. But at the 1999 European elections, it was suddenly well-placed to pick up protest votes.

Politicians, who have little enough time to spend with their own offspring, will be dangling babes on their knees and getting stuck into the water play. Babies are shaping up to be one of the key battlegrounds in the election; we're being subjected to a blizzard of policies from paid paternity leave, baby bonds, free childcare for teenage mums, to the Tory promise of tax cuts for stay-at-home married mums.

David Miliband (head of Number 10's policy unit) charged with the task of drawing up the manifesto, is now up there with Freud and Mel Gibson, trying to figure out what women want.</p> <p>The answer last Friday in Bolton Institute in Lancashire was blindingly clear. Stephen Byers, the trade and industry secretary, was dutifully listening to a group of women giving him a short but very expensive shopping list of exactly what they want. It was the last of a series of meetings as part of the consultation exercise on the green paper, Work and Parents; Byers's recommendations will be in the manifesto. There were only two things which exercised these women: firstly, accessible, affordable, good quality childcare, and secondly, the right to flexible working. Compared to these two, a couple of weeks of paternity leave or a few more weeks extra of paid maternity leave were welcome, but wouldn't make that much difference to women's lives. What mattered was not so much the few months at the beginning of the child's life, but the day-to-day juggling for 15-20 years of raising a family as a working parent.</p> <p>For all Byers's listening, the things women really want are the least likely to appear in the Labour manifesto. Firstly, the kind of childcare needed will cost the earth. As ever, the devil is in the detail. One woman in Bolton described how nurses couldn't find nurseries which opened earlier than 8.30am when their shifts started at 7.30am; another told of the expense of paying for breakfast clubs, after-school clubs and holiday play schemes on a single mother's salary. Shift working and the 24/7 service culture means that childcare arranged around the old 9-5 day is useless. The childcare has to be local or you'll be late for work. Kids left alone between one parent going on shift and another returning. This is just-in-time family life.</p> <p>For the state to ease the strain requires an investment equal (perhaps more) to what we spend on primary education. Nursery provision with its need for high adult-child ratios is massively expensive, but if it is to accommodate contemporary working patterns and be local enough to be useful, the scale of the challenge becomes truly enormous, as the Kids' Clubs Network report last month made clear. One day, childcare could be up there along with health, education and transport as one of the government's big spending departments. But that's blue-sky thinking for now. New Labour has enough difficulty in delivering on its traditional commitments without launching a huge, new ambitious role for the state. Besides, to be fair, the pressure isn't strong enough, the care of children outside of school hours is not yet seen as the responsibility of the state but of their parents. Over the next two decades, for good or ill, that will change driven by the need to facilitate women's participation in the labour market. In the meantime, the government inches its way into this territory with such initiatives as the national childcare strategy.</p> <p>The second item on the shopping list, the right to flexible working, is where things get really contentious. New Labour is caught between its desire to feminise and its cosy relationship with business. Blair, in his speech in Glasgow last weekend, gave an indication of which side they might come down on: he promised two weeks of paid paternity leave but the right to flexible work was out. It seems women ministers have fought hard and lost; the green paper admits that this issue dominated the ministerial group's discussions. Business is implacably opposed to any legislation on this; the women's lobby is equally convinced that it is the only option which reflects that the vast majority of women want to work and to look after their children. On both sides, there are \"fundamentalists\", says Byers darkly, while insisting that the issue has not yet been decided.</p> <p>The most striking feature of Friday's meeting was the high sense of expectation from women that the government is going to do something big. The small business representatives became more and more depressed and eventually silent; they feel they've lost the battle already. While campaigners believe, encouraged by Byers, that they are on the verge of an historic breakthrough. The women's groups greeted the green paper last year with delight - it scored eight out of ten in Bolton on Friday - what they failed to notice was that it assiduously avoided committing the government to anything, it simply laid out options. The time of reckoning is fast approaching. If Byers gets it wrong, there'll be a lot of disappointed women and in constituencies like Bolton West, where Ruth Kelly is defending a switch in 1997 from long-term Tory to Labour on a miserable 30% turnout, that could matter. Mary Anne Stephenson, director of the Fawcett Society, argues that a big cause of the slipping female vote is that Labour has raised women's expectations but failed to deliver on them. The biggest single thing Labour could do for women in the manifesto is the legal right to flexible work - that would make all the rhetoric on work/life balance mean something. If Labour fudges that one, and thinks it can seduce women with a few weeks here or there of paternity and extra maternity leave, plus lots of pictures of adorable babies, it had better think again.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:&quot;madeleine.bunting@theguardian.com&quot;\">madeleine.bunting@theguardian.com</a></p>",

Business is implacably opposed to any legislation on this; the women's lobby is equally convinced that it is the only option which reflects that the vast majority of women want to work and to look after their children. On both sides, there are \"fundamentalists\", says Byers darkly, while insisting that the issue has not yet been decided. The most striking feature of Friday's meeting was the high sense of expectation from women that the government is going to do something big. The small business representatives became more and more depressed and eventually silent; they feel they've lost the battle already. While campaigners believe, encouraged by Byers, that they are on the verge of an historic breakthrough. The women's groups greeted the green paper last year with delight - it scored eight out of ten in Bolton on Friday - what they failed to notice was that it assiduously avoided committing the government to anything, it simply laid out options. The time of reckoning is fast approaching. If Byers gets it wrong, there'll be a lot of disappointed women and in constituencies like Bolton West, where Ruth Kelly is defending a switch in 1997 from long-term Tory to Labour on a miserable 30% turnout, that could matter. Mary Anne Stephenson, director of the Fawcett Society, argues that a big cause of the slipping female vote is that Labour has raised women's expectations but failed to deliver on them. The biggest single thing Labour could do for women in the manifesto is the legal right to flexible work - that would make all the rhetoric on work/life balance mean something. If Labour fudges that one, and thinks it can seduce women with a few weeks here or there of paternity and extra maternity leave, plus lots of pictures of adorable babies, it had better think again. madeleine.bunting@theguardian.com",

After failing at auction it was provisionally acquired by the trust, and is awaiting resurrection in a cupboard at the house of another East Anglian artist, the Gainsborough Museum in Sudbury, Suffolk.</p> <p>The campaign to save it for the Stour valley has won local support. A further \u00a310,000 anonymous donation came at the weekend, leaving the trust with less than \u00a320,000 to raise of the \u00a370,000 cost of purchase and conservation work.</p> <p>The picture will be placed on long loan in the parish church at Dedham, the centre of Constable country. Hordes of cultural pilgrims visit each year, but no major works by Constable are on display in the area.</p> <p>The Risen Christ is one of only three religious paintings known by Constable.

      "bodyText": "A canvas of the risen Christ by John Constable, famous for his lyrical rural landscapes under brooding East Anglian skies, will be returned to the heart of Constable country on Ascension Thursday, saved by a local trust from auction and export. The painting has had a chequered history: the church for which it was originally commissioned was demolished, and it was later sold to pay for a new heating system for its second home. After failing at auction it was provisionally acquired by the trust, and is awaiting resurrection in a cupboard at the house of another East Anglian artist, the Gainsborough Museum in Sudbury, Suffolk. The campaign to save it for the Stour valley has won local support. A further \u00a310,000 anonymous donation came at the weekend, leaving the trust with less than \u00a320,000 to raise of the \u00a370,000 cost of purchase and conservation work. The picture will be placed on long loan in the parish church at Dedham, the centre of Constable country. Hordes of cultural pilgrims visit each year, but no major works by Constable are on display in the area. The Risen Christ is one of only three religious paintings known by Constable. The priest for whom it was commissioned died, and Constable was uncertain that he would be paid. Hugh Belsey, director of the trust, can find no evidence in the records that he ever got the promised \u00a3200. The Risen Christ was commissioned in 1821 by the brewer Edward Alston, who hoped to present it to Archdeacon John Jefferson for the church in Manningtree, Essex, and in return win permission to open more local pubs. Jefferson died but the church got the painting, and it remained as an altarpiece until 1965, when the 17th century building was condemned as unsafe and demolished. A local priest, the Rev Aubrey Moody, bought it for \u00a31,250 with his own money, for his church at Feering, Essex, where it remained until last year when the ancient heating system finally expired.

However, it is also surprising that in an earlier article (UK at bottom of languages class, February 20), there is absolutely no mention of the wealth of non-European languages which exist among the ethnic minorities and which are totally undervalued and neglected within the education system. Just another example of the hegemonic Anglo-Saxon culture? Martha Worsching Dept of European studies, Loughborough University M.M.Worsching@lboro.ac.uk \u0095 I was astonished to see Tony Blair on television a week or two ago, in the market place at Cahors, greeting an aged peasant with: \"Et tu vas bien?\" He may have worked as a barman on the Left Bank, where it is de rigueur (as we say in English) to tu-toi everybody all the time, but it is not acceptable when talking to a gnarled old peasant in the Midi, and is in fact extremely rude. It is not good enough to know a few words of a language, but to have no idea about the social mores and cultural diversity of our near neighbours. Anita Pheby Castle Cary, Somerset \u0095 Jean Holmes and her pupil (Letter, February 23) who ordered coffee in French in Brussels were, unlike me, not solemnly warned about rule one of visiting Belgium: do not try to practise your French there as only about half the citizens speak it and the other half get very offended indeed (as the waiter she mentions duly did).

Opponents of the women's applications turned out in force over the weekend to vote at the recently rebuilt Liceu opera house on the city's central Las Ramblas boulevard. The club turned down all 10 women but approved membership for three men. The rules of the Cercle club meant that only a third of the 1,000 members needed to vote with a blackball to block the women's applications. The applicants gained only 60% of the vote and, under club rules, cannot reapply for five years. Caball\u00e9 made no comment about the vote, which followed a recent change in club rules allowing women to apply. Opponents of the change, led by younger members, said the reform had been forced through by the Cercle's ruling committee. That committee vowed yesterday to change the statutes again so that new members could join with a simple majority vote in favour. \"Some members just do not realise that this is the 21st century and that an organisation whose aim is to promote cultural life in Barcelona cannot exclude women,\" said a committee spokesman. The club's decision to blackball the women may face a court challenge under Spain's equal opportunity laws.",

The editors of the 2001 guide, published this week, decided that Mr Ducasse no longer deserved the ultimate accolade for the cuisine at his Monte Carlo eatery, where the price of a three-course meal averages \u00a3180, and demoted the establishment to two stars. But Mr Ducasse, who between TV appearances, product endorsements and half a dozen restaurants worldwide, is a one-man haute cuisine industry, did collect three stars for his Paris flagship hangout at the Plaza Ath\u00e9n\u00e9e hotel. Succeeding him as the uncrowned king of French cuisine is Marc Veyrat, 50, a Savoyard chef who already held three stars for his Auberge de l'Eridan near Annecy and this year wins another three for his new Alpine establishment, La Ferme de mon p\u00e8re in M\u00e9geve. But in underlining the fact that Mr Veyrat's two restaurants are open consecutively - the first in summer, the second in winter - while Mr Ducasse's establishments in Paris and Monte Carlo serve supper all year round, the Michelin guide appears to have made its point: no top chef can be in more than one kitchen at the same time, or his cooking will suffer. The decision by the reviewers, whose judgment is so feared that chefs have been known to commit suicide on losing a star, will send shivers down the spine of more than one celebrity cook. Paul Bocuse, another three-star Gallic culinary wizard, has admitted to being so busy that he is forced to use ghost chefs, saying: \"Do you seriously think Enzo Ferrari puts all the nuts on all the cars he sells?\" By rewarding Mr Veyrat, the guide has also recognised adventurousness rather than tradition.

      "bodyText": "Japan has been attacked for its \"inhuman\" and secretive treatment of death row prisoners after a European human rights delegation was refused access to inmates and execution facilities. The delegation of lawmakers from the Council of Europe (which is wider than and unconnected to the European Union) was on a first ever international fact-finding mission into one of the world's most secretive systems of capital punishment. But the delegation ran into a brick wall when it attempted to investigate how convicts are looked after and executed, raising the prospect of a diplomatic row that would be embarrassing for Japan. The mission was invited by one of the 28 death row convicts - whose name cannot be revealed under Japanese regulations - at the Tokyo detention house, but their request to see him as turned down by the justice ministry and the prison warden. \"They told us that we couldn't meet any inmates because it might disturb their peace of mind,\" said the mission's leader, Gunnar Jansson, the chairman of the council's human rights committee. \"I've never heard anything like it.\" The group's mission is to determine whether Japan and other countries which still enforce the death penalty should retain their observer status at the Council of Europe, all of whose members promised in 1997 to abolish capital punishment. But while they have received offers of full cooperation in the US and other countries, in Japan they were only permitted to view an empty cell. \"It is extremely sad that the Japanese justice ministry has taken such an attitude,\" said Nobuto Hosaka, the leader of a group of Japanese MPs in favour of abolishing the death penalty. \"Clearly, Japan is trying to hide its executions from the international community.\" Japan has hanged 39 people since 1993 and 54 remain on death row. It gives no advance warning of executions, which are carried out in secret, usually during the New Year holiday when they are least likely to attract publicity. Prisoners are not informed of impending execution until an hour before it takes place. Their families have no advance warning and the names of those killed are never made public. The average hanging takes 23 minutes. No relatives or other observers are allowed to be present. On at least one occasion, the rope has failed to do the job and executioners have strangled the convict. \"The treatment of the inmates is inhuman,\" said Mr Jansson. \"The system of announcing the execution order on the same morning could be seen as torture.\" Citing this as a \"problem\" in relations between Japan and the Council of Europe, he said it was \"completely possible\" that he would recommend that Japan's observer status, granted in 1996, be revoked. The council's visit comes a week after the EU petitioned the Japanese government to abolish the death penalty. \"The EU calls on Japan to renew its commitment to promoting respect for human rights by joining it in abolishing capital punishment in line with the international community view,\" the request said. The Japanese justice minister, Masahiko Komura, has rejected calls for abolition or a moratorium. \"Eighty per cent of the public say the death penalty is imperative so it should be maintained,\" he said during a meeting with the EU delegation this week. \"The nation's court rulings on the death penalty are based on an extremely thoughtful judgement and the actual executions are based on careful consideration. As a result, there is no need for a moratorium.\" The man who spent 30 years expecting each day to be his last The most terrifying aspect of Japanese capital punishment is the unusually high risk that innocent people may be executed, according to the man who knows life on death row better than anyone. Sakae Menda, now 78, spent more than 30 years thinking that each day could be his last after being sentenced to death in 1951 for a murder he did not commit. As in 99% of criminal trials in Japan, the judge (there are no juries) ruled in favour of the prosecution. The main evidence was a confession extracted from Mr Menda while in police custody. \"They tied a rope around my ankles and hung me upside down from the ceiling. They took it in shifts to kick me and beat. I wasn't allowed to eat, sleep or drink until I told them what they wanted to hear,\" recalls Mr Menda, one of a handful of death-row prisoners to win a retrial. As is true today, detectives were able to hold him for more than three weeks without charging him and he had no legal right to insist that a lawyer be present at all interrogations. Although Mr Menda later retracted his confession at the high court, he was sent to Fukuoka prison to await execution. \"Words can never describe the constant dread of being faced with death every single day,\" he says. \"The first time I saw another inmate being taking to the execution room, I went insane.\" His fit of screaming earned him chobatsu, the toughest form of punishment. For two months, he was handcuffed to a metal belt tied around his waist, forcing him to eat like a dog. Although he was well behaved for the rest of his long incarceration, he was allowed out of his toilet-sized cell for only two hours a day. Prisoners believed their guards' reports determined the timing of executions. \"Those who misbehaved seemed to be chosen first for hanging. We felt that guards had the power of life or death over us,\" he says. When Mr Menda first entered prison, inmates were informed the night before their executions, but that system was changed after one man committed suicide before he could be hanged. Mr Menda won his freedom in 1983 after five previous attempts to secure a retrial had failed. On his release, he was given 7,000 yen (\u00a340) for every day of his wrongful imprisonment. He has given half of that 90m yen (\u00a3500,000) to a lawyers' group fighting for the release of death-row prisoners who are protesting their innocence.",

      "body": "<p>While you are reading this I would like you to smile. Think chipmunk, think Carol Smillie. No flagging you there at the back. And why am I asking you to grin loonishly in the office, or on the train, or while pouring out your cornflakes? Because I would like you to understand what it is like to be a receptionist. I would like you to have an inkling of how it feels to smile, unwaveringly, for a sizeable part of the day. But beneath this chirpy exterior, the life of the receptionist is, allegedly, a miserable affair. It is like Judy Garland, concealing her tragedy behind that glittering showbiz persona, or Smokey Robinson, his smile looking so very out of place, as he tried to hide The Tracks of His Tears. For receptionists are bored, isolated, and frankly want a little r-e-s-p-e-c-t. Or so says a survey conducted by recruitment consultants Maine-Tucker. </p> <p> A third of surveyed receptionists complained that they were bored in their job. One hesitates to point out that being bored in your job is rather par for the course. It is like going to school and hating double maths lessons, even if you are the maths teacher. Show me a chartered accountant who isn't bored rigid with the tedium of spreadsheets. That said, of course, the receptionist has the responsibility of not looking bored in the slightest. All yawns must be stifled, and there is no slouching on the job. The receptionist simply does not have the luxury of being able to slump, head in hands, and curse loudly in the middle of the afternoon. </p> <p> One fifth claimed that they felt cut off from the rest of the company, especially those working in larger organisations. Just a tip of the hat and a brief hello as the rest of the office shuffles past first thing in the morning, and last thing at night. There is no camaraderie, no banter, no picking over the details of last night's escapades. The receptionist is often viewed as the face of a company. She or he is more than likely the first person visitors will meet when they enter the building. Therefore, the receptionist has to be well-groomed and smartly turned out. There can't be any Pot Noodle on your blouse, or spinach stuck between your teeth in this game. Some large firms even give their receptionists a clothing allowance to ensure that they always look presentable. </p> <p> Crucially, the receptionist has to appear approachable. It is the absolute antithesis of the sneery reception you get in designer clothing stores, where no one wants to help you, and you really don't want to ask whether they have this spangly frock in your size. This is where the smiling comes in. A genuine-looking, open-lipped smile suggests warmth and openness. It puts a visitor at ease. </p> <p> But being a receptionist is not merely about answering telephones and calling up to the fourth floor to say \"Mr Jones, Mr Garfunkel is in reception\". It is often about dealing with customers or clients who are upset, or annoyed, or downright livid. The receptionist may have to bear the brunt of a visitor's dissatisfaction with the company as a whole, or with having to wait to speak to somebody in the firm, or even with the fact that he missed his train to work this morning and had to fork out for a cab. Some customers may even be violent or threatening. Indeed, the Maine-Tucker report found that 28% of those surveyed wanted to be treated with more respect by both staff and visitors. </p> <p> At a time when the role of the secretary is viewed as increasingly vital, where a business can't tick without someone who understands the technology and all the nitty-gritty of running the office, receptionists are feeling particularly overlooked. The potential for promotion from a secretarial position is ever more likely. But for a receptionist to hotfoot it up the career ladder from the lobby is a substantially more difficult task. It is in smaller companies, especially in start-ups, that receptionists feel their role is more valued. Furthermore, in such organisations, there is more of a \"muck in\" approach to work, where everyone, irrespective of their job, gets to contribute to a project. In this way, receptionists may get the chance to show that they have skills beyond the front desk, and are eligible for promotion. Now that is a reason for smiling.</p>",

She or he is more than likely the first person visitors will meet when they enter the building. Therefore, the receptionist has to be well-groomed and smartly turned out. There can't be any Pot Noodle on your blouse, or spinach stuck between your teeth in this game. Some large firms even give their receptionists a clothing allowance to ensure that they always look presentable. Crucially, the receptionist has to appear approachable. It is the absolute antithesis of the sneery reception you get in designer clothing stores, where no one wants to help you, and you really don't want to ask whether they have this spangly frock in your size. This is where the smiling comes in. A genuine-looking, open-lipped smile suggests warmth and openness. It puts a visitor at ease. But being a receptionist is not merely about answering telephones and calling up to the fourth floor to say \"Mr Jones, Mr Garfunkel is in reception\". It is often about dealing with customers or clients who are upset, or annoyed, or downright livid. The receptionist may have to bear the brunt of a visitor's dissatisfaction with the company as a whole, or with having to wait to speak to somebody in the firm, or even with the fact that he missed his train to work this morning and had to fork out for a cab. Some customers may even be violent or threatening. Indeed, the Maine-Tucker report found that 28% of those surveyed wanted to be treated with more respect by both staff and visitors. At a time when the role of the secretary is viewed as increasingly vital, where a business can't tick without someone who understands the technology and all the nitty-gritty of running the office, receptionists are feeling particularly overlooked. The potential for promotion from a secretarial position is ever more likely. But for a receptionist to hotfoot it up the career ladder from the lobby is a substantially more difficult task. It is in smaller companies, especially in start-ups, that receptionists feel their role is more valued. Furthermore, in such organisations, there is more of a \"muck in\" approach to work, where everyone, irrespective of their job, gets to contribute to a project. In this way, receptionists may get the chance to show that they have skills beyond the front desk, and are eligible for promotion. Now that is a reason for smiling.",

Within seconds, flames were licking the Northumberland sky. Traffic came to a halt. Roads were closed, aircraft were diverted. Soon a long column of smoke was drifting eastwards, smothering the stars on a crystal clear night and the grim reality of the exercise became apparent.</p> <p>This was a funeral, of sorts - the first in a series of mass cremations designed to rid Britain of a 21st-century scourge that many thought had been consigned to history a quarter of a century ago.</p> <p>The pyre lighting up Northumberland marked the first visible sign of a crisis that could bring British farming to its knees as hundreds of pigs identified as the likely source of Britain's foot and mouth outbreak were incinerated on tonnes of coal, brushwood and railway sleepers.</p> <p>After a weekend operation to kill 850 pigs from two farms at Heddon-on-the-Wall, along with 35 cattle, animals doused with oil and diesel were placed on a 150 metre-long trench, and slowly set alight just before 9pm last night. By all accounts, the stench of rotting, burning flesh near the trench was all-pervading. But from a hill less than half a mile away, just above the Tyne Valley - the closest anyone was allowed to the pyre - the reality of death for this little corner of British farming, and the agricultural community, was hard to appreciate. This was simply a spectacle.</p> <p>In below-freezing temperatures, Ministry of Agriculture vets worked against the clock under arc lights to dispose of the carcasses on the pyre - likely to burn for 24 hours - before more heavy snow was due. They will be at it again, possibly tomorrow, at a farm barely four miles away where 40 cattle have been slaughtered.</p> <p>Hours earlier ministry officials revealed they had been concerned about activities at Burnside farm, Heddon-on-the-Wall, for months after complaints about poor welfare at the holding. Vets had served its operators with a notice in December warning that conditions must be improved within a month, it was revealed. When they returned late in January, vets reported that conditions had got better - although they were still not adequate, the ministry said. A further visit had been planned for this month but plans were overtaken by the foot and mouth outbreak.</p> <p>But the ministry said that, late in January, there were no traces of foot and mouth in pigs at the farm, in effect a fattening centre where animals were sent before a long journey to abattoirs in the south.</p> <p>Death came speedily to Burnside yesterday. Carefully laying 250 railway sleepers across the pit, ministry experts and labourers piled 75 tonnes of coal and two lorry loads of straw onto a giant pyre before adding the pigs and cattle in what amounted to a two-day long construction exercise. Cremations on this scale do not come quickly, or cheaply.</p> <p>Clad in bright yellow and red overalls, they had supervised mechanical excavators and tractors hauling dumper trucks carrying the remains of pigs from two farms at Heddon-on-the-Wall - Bobby and Ronald Waughs holding at Burnside, with its 500 animals, believed to be the original source, and Jimmy and Joan Brown's neighbouring unit at Heddon View, with 350 pigs and 35 cattle.</p> <p>After taking blood samples from the pigs, ministry vets had been humanely killing the animals over two days with stun guns, carefully recording particulars from each beast. After slaughter, they soon discovered that the Heddon View pigs, initially condemned to death as a precaution, also had traces of foot and mouth - making the outbreak far bigger than initial estimates suggested.</p> <p>The Browns, who have been keeping pigs at Heddon View for 35 years, are reluctant to criticise their neighbours and have refused to join in the chorus of disapproval against the Waugh brothers, who have insisted in a statement issued through the National Farmers' Union that it was not in their interest to have unhealthy pigs. But Joan Brown told a local paper yesterday: \"It's just unfortunate they didn't farm the same way we farmed.\"</p> <p>With farmers in Northumberland fearful of the disease spreading - cattle at another farm beside Newcastle airport four miles away have already been condemned - the ministry said last night it had been forced to take action after the RSPCA was refused access to Burnside following a complaint to the Association by the Norfolk-based Hillside Animal Sanctuary on December 18. The sanctuary said it had been told by a reliable Northumberland contact that rotting pig carcasses had been left alongside live pigs and that pieces of raw meat were left lying around the farm.</p> <p>After visiting the stricken area yesterday, Joyce Quin, minister of state for agriculture, said that while the ministry was always concerned about welfare matters, it would be wrong to prejudge the outcome of any inquiry. Asked about local people raising fears over Burnside several months ago, she said officials on January 24 saw no sign of disease at the farm.</p> <p>\"Obviously, welfare-related problems are pursued also - sometimes by a slightly different avenue - but the responsibility of the department on that inspection was to see whether there was disease on the farm and at that point they did not find disease.

The dramatic events in Devon unfolded overnight on Saturday as samples from a sick cow were rushed to the World Reference Laboratory for foot and mouth disease at Pirbright in Surrey. The disease was confirmed yesterday. Ian Johnson, regional spokesman for the National Farmers' Union, said: \"This is potentially a nightmare scenario for the south-west, which is Britain's biggest livestock area. In good times it would be a disaster but in times like these it is a catastrophe.\" Mr Brown will fly to Brussels tomorrow to brief his EU opposite numbers, who are concerned that the UK may have exported foot and mouth.

This and contingency plans for the postponement of the Cheltenham Festival will be discussed by the racing authorities and the Ministry of Agriculture this morning, although no definitive decision is likely at this stage. It was Anthony Gibson, south west director of the National Farmers' Union, who warned yesterday about the severity of the crisis facing the country following another confirmed case of foot and mouth in a farm in North Devon. Gibson said: \"I fear that the latest outbreak of this disease could be even worse than 33 years ago.\" On that occasion racing ground to a halt for six weeks and depending on when it was imposed a similar suspension could mean that the Grand National, scheduled for April 7, could be lost as well as Cheltenham. Whether these fixtures can be rearranged will be part of the agenda this morning when representatives of the British Horseracing Board, the Jockey Club, the National Trainers' Federation, the Racecourse Association and the Animal Health Trust will get their heads together. Tristram Ricketts, secretary general of the BHB, said: \"We have been keeping in touch with the appropriate authorities and there is no indication as yet that a cessation of racing is necessary other than in the exclusion zones. We are, of course, carrying out disinfectant precautions at all tracks. \"If it continues to spread, however, then anything is possible and the Cheltenham Festival is only two weeks away. But as yet no contingency plans have been drawn up.\" One piece of good news is that the suspected outbreak of the disease at Stroud, less than 30 miles from Cheltenham, has not been confirmed. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food commented yesterday: \"MAFF has not said anything about stopping racing yet as long as all correct precautions are taken.\" However, the agriculture minister Nick Brown is likely to take a much stronger line if the country's worse fears are realised in the next few days. Horses cannot catch foot and mouth, but it can spread rapidly among livestock and the movement of horseboxes and people around the country is regarded as potentially dangerous. Peter Webbon, chief veterinary advisor to the Jockey Club, said: \"By pulling people together, and racing crowds are often mainly from rural areas, there is a possibility that the disease could be spread. But as I see it this would apply to rugby matches just as much, although not football as this is mainly an urban game.\" The Irish agriculture minister Joe Walsh is far from happy and is reported to be considering imposing a ban on Irish runners at the Cheltenham Festival. Ireland missed the outbreak in this country 33 years ago and there has been no sign of the disease in the country since 1941. Any ban, however, by the Irish would not necessarily be as drastic as it sounds and Aidan O'Brien's Istabraq could still defend his Champion Hurdle crown provided the gelding remained in this country until after the disease had subsided. Willie Mullins, trainer of Cheltenham Gold Cup hope Florida Pearl, commented: \"If there was a risk that the horses may not be allowed back into Ireland straight away then most of mine would probably stay at home and wait for Punchestown in April.\" But Francois Doumen, the French trainer, is determined to press ahead with the Gold Cup favourite First Gold's Cheltenham challenge. Speaking at Kempton on Saturday, he said: \"My runners here will go home tonight and I see no reason to change my plans at the moment. \"There is no question of them staying in this country until Cheltenham. \"I cannot see the French authorities intervening to say there should be no movement across the Channel at this stage, but if they did my horses would come over as normal and stay on after Cheltenham.\"",

      "bodyText": "Sir Donald Bradman, the greatest cricketer of the 20th century, has died in Adelaide at the age of 92. The Australian batsman, whose Test batting average of 99.94 has never been rivalled, died at his home, according to ABC radio reports. From 1930 until his fourth tour of England in 1948 Bradman dominated the world batting scene. As Australia's captain he displayed the same clinical judgment and unbroken concentration that were the essence of his batsmanship. His batting possessed a ruthlessness and singlemindedness and his domination over all types of bowling eventually became so complete that even his greatest admirers admitted that a contest could often lose interest for becoming too one-sided. For years after his retirement as a player, he was the eminence grise of Australian cricket with a journalist once dubbing him \"the Australian cricketing Tsar\". But ironically, this month saw the 30th anniversary of his resignation as a Test selector - during the 1970-71 Ashes series, which England won 2-0. That was only England's second series win in Australia since the notorious 1932-33 Bodyline series in which Bradman had played. For all the adulation, Bradman had a lonely side. He preferred to remain apart from team camaraderie and after his retirement in 1948 protected his privacy. He averaged a century in every three innings he played in a 21-year first-class career. Early this year Bradman was reported to be resting at home in Adelaide after a bout of pneumonia had put him into hospital before Christmas. His son John issued a statement on January 11 about his father's health following a rash of speculation that he was close to death. \"Prior to Christmas he was in hospital with pneumonia,\" John Bradman said. \"He was very pleased to return home and is now there resting under medical supervision. \"The family recognises that there is legitimate interest in the health and wellbeing of my father but we ask that everyone respects his privacy.\" Wisden, the cricket bible, last year named Bradman the best cricketer of the 20th century. He scored 6,996 Test runs during the 1930s and 1940s. The director of the Bradman Foundation, Richard Mulvaney, confirmed his death yesterday. \"Sir Donald Bradman died yesterday morning, peacefully at his home, after a short illness with pneumonia,\" Mr Mulvaney said. In August, Bradman broke a long public silence to deliver a message about the state of cricket. \"As my days on earth rapidly draw to a close,\" he said, \"I am proud to have set an example of all that is best in our noble game. \"Despite recent sad developments, cricket will survive and remain our most noble game and I shall always remain proud of the part I played in its history and development.\"",

In October and November about 10% of escalators were out of service. There were more than 1000 peak train cancellations in December and a third of those were because no driver had turned up. The Piccadilly line lost more than a fifth of its scheduled trains, the Bakerloo line nearly a quarter. Across the whole network, more than 10% of scheduled trains did not run that month. The figures reveal remarkable differences between lines and highlight areas where there seem to be particular management and absenteeism problems. The Bakerloo, District, Circle and Hammersmith lines stand out as having problems with \"no operator\" - that is, no driver arriving for a scheduled train. The information on the tube's performance has been collected by the greater London authority's Transport for London board as it tries to work out what it will take on when the transport commissioner, Robert Kiley, and the government agree a new structure for the underground. Wrangling over the underground reached a new intensity over the weekend, with Mr Kiley accusing the chancellor, Gordon Brown, of blocking progress on talks about a new structure of ownership. Mr Kiley's team said that the government's public-private partnership (PPP) scheme would cost up to \u00a3800m more in its first period than its own proposals. Mr Kiley maintains that the public-private partnership plan is fatally flawed, and that there must be unified management control of the underground. Tensions within the government have become apparent. The prime minister, Tony Blair, Mr Brown and the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, are expected to meet today to try to reach an agreement. The cost of financing investment in the tube could be 25% higher, or \u00a3800m more in the first 7 years, under the PPP proposal than under revised plans put forward by Mr Kiley. Jay Walder, managing director of finance for Transport for London, said: \"All of the bids fail to meet the test of value for money.\" He added that Mr Kiley's team had been given the full details of the PPP proposals for the first time only at the beginning of February. Their analysis found them to be prohibitively expensive, dangerous and inefficient, sources said. Mr Kiley said he received written agreement from Mr Prescott that the PPP should be modified and that another round of bidding for revised contracts would be required. Mr Kiley's report to the mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, seen by the Guardian, said that each time his team put forward new proposals they were considered briefly but then rejected \"after invention from the Treasury\". Speaking on BBC1's Breakfast with Frost, Mr Kiley characterised the chancellor as \"the Wizard of Oz\" controlling events from behind the scenes.\" Tony Travers, director of the London School of Economics' Greater London Group, said that the performance figures supplied to Transport for London helped to pinpoint the extent of management problems. \"We need a national audit office inquiry into procurement in the 1990s. A lot of the new equipment they have bought is defective. The King's Cross escalators which have been closed for months are only eight or nine years old. The Angel has been closed relentlessly recently, but it was rebuilt only eight years ago. \"About \u00a310bn was spent on capital in that decade, roughly \u00a36bn of that on the core system. That's more than 10% of the entire UK public sector capital investment in that period. \"All that money to make the system worse than it was.\"",

      "body": "<p><strong>Is the financial collapse in Turkey the start of another emerging markets meltdown like the Asian crisis?</strong> </p> <p>So far, no, but it's a bit early to declare the danger over. The lira has lost more than 30% of its value since the government stopped trying to prop it up last week. </p> <p>That makes Turkey's large foreign debt more expensive to repay because most of the loans were made in dollars. As a result, Turkey's already wobbly banking system is under further pressure. </p> <p><strong> Why did the government devalue?</strong> </p> <p>It had to. Overnight interest rates had risen to 4,000% as it desperately tried to hold the lira's value to the dollar. Just as in the Asian crisis, floating the currency swaps one problem for another. Interest rates have fallen back, but now foreign, not domestic borrowing is putting the strain on the financial system. </p> <p><strong> Isn't that what happened in some Asian countries?</strong> </p> <p>Yes, although Turkey's debt is nothing like as big.

      "bodyText": "Is the financial collapse in Turkey the start of another emerging markets meltdown like the Asian crisis? So far, no, but it's a bit early to declare the danger over. The lira has lost more than 30% of its value since the government stopped trying to prop it up last week. That makes Turkey's large foreign debt more expensive to repay because most of the loans were made in dollars. As a result, Turkey's already wobbly banking system is under further pressure. Why did the government devalue? It had to. Overnight interest rates had risen to 4,000% as it desperately tried to hold the lira's value to the dollar. Just as in the Asian crisis, floating the currency swaps one problem for another. Interest rates have fallen back, but now foreign, not domestic borrowing is putting the strain on the financial system. Isn't that what happened in some Asian countries? Yes, although Turkey's debt is nothing like as big. South Korea owed foreign lenders $150bn when its financial system started crumbling. Turkish banks have borrowed around $45bn. It's a much smaller economy and has limited trade links outside of Europe. Asia's crisis spread rapidly because many countries in the region proved to be weak when their economies came under pressure. Luckily for Turkey it has some strong neighbours. Germany is the country most exposed to bad losses and its economy is scarcely going to be troubled by a $10bn sour investment. So are the risks limited to Europe? The trouble with financial crises is that they are about panic not logic. If investors decide that emerging markets are looking dodgy again, they may pull out of the countries they consider weak, regardless of whether there is any logical link with events in Turkey. Which countries are the likely victims? Countries with lots of short term international borrowing are vulnerable. Within Europe, the Czech republic is a possible candidate, though its total bill isn't very high. Argentina and Brazil owe a lot, and about half of it is short term borrowing. Another factor is currency pegs which are looking increasingly like bad idea. When speculators take on governments, they usually win because they have more money - as is demonstrated by the ejection of the pound from the exchange rate mechanism. Which countries still have fixed currencies? Malaysia and Argentina still fix their currencies to the dollar. Hong Kong has a fixed currency but it operates a system whereby it holds as many US dollars as are needed to buy every single Hong Kong dollar in circulation, thus ensuring a speculative run on the currency can always be stopped. Most Latin American countries have abandoned pegs in favour of currency boards - like Hong Kong's - or fully adopting the dollar. However, Africa is a different story. It has two big regional currency blocs which are pegged to the French franc and therefore the euro. The economies of the region are weak because of falling commodity prices, and political upheaval which is also shutting down western aid programmes. A devaluation would make political and economic sense and would have limited impact on the rest of the world because the economies are so small to begin with. So which country is the number one candidate if the crisis spreads? Probably Argentina. It owes a lot of money, it has a pegged currency, which is coming under increasing pressure, and it has had big inflows of \"hot money\" from investors in search of a quick return taking a bet that the currency peg will hold. If the peg crumbles there will be a mad rush for the exits.",

After a trade embargo, the UN stopped private flights, banned visas for the junta and froze Haitian assets. These failed to achieve a return to democracy; military intervention followed.</p> <p>The purpose of any sanctions against Iraq is going to be unchanged: to keep pressure on the regime until it lets UN inspectors return to monitor its weapons.</p> <p>Weekend reports that Iraq may be just three years from acquiring nuclear weapons, and another claiming that it secretly tested a bomb in 1989, have heightened the concern.</p> <p>But there is doubt whether Iraq will ever allow inspectors back, regardless of the pressure. Sir John Moberly, a former British ambassador to Jordan, believes that deterrence should be the focus, so that \"if Saddam starts to deploy nuclear, chemical or biological weapons he will risk being hit extremely hard by the United States or other UN security council members\".</p> <p>That, he goes on, would mean rebuilding a security council consensus on Iraq, bringing France, Russia and China back on board: \"Ease sanctions but agree on a response to Iraqi deployment of weapons.\"</p> <p>Two years ago a group of American foreign policy experts proposed a tougher plan: a \"systematic air campaign\" against President Saddam's Republican Guard and the setting up of an alternative government inside Iraq with US military and financial backing.</p> <p>Among this group were Donald Rumsfeld, now President Bush's defence secretary, Paul Wolfowitz, number two at the Pentagon, and Richard Armitage, number two at the state department.</p> <p>Such ideas, however, are not likely to appeal to the secretary of state, Colin Powell, who has said he believes the policy of containment is working.</p> <p><b>Targeting regime leaders is no simple matter</b></p> <p>This is what experts say about the pros and cons of ways to penalise Iraq:</p> <p><b> \u0095 Economic sanctions</b></p> <p>Nothing has done more to discredit economic sanctions than hold-ups in the delivery of essential goods to Iraq, on the grounds that they might have a military use.</p> <p>\"Sanctions that were genuinely smarter,\" says Neil Partrick, of the Royal United Services Institute in London, \"would shift the situation from saying that everything is forbidden, with certain exceptions, to saying that everything is permitted except some items, such as those with seriously potential dual use.\" Or, says Gary Sick of Columbia University, New York, don't allow unlimited quantities of dubious items.</p> <p>As for exports, all Iraqi oil revenue must go into a UN account. The UN is unlikely to relinquish this lever, as it uses part of the money to feed Iraq's Kurds and compensate victims of Baghdad's 1990 invasion of Kuwait - the act that unleashed the Gulf war and led to sanctions.</p> <p>But easing the policy on imports could be balanced by being tougher on smuggling, to stop illicit oil getting out and weapons getting in.</p> <p>Border checks are far from rigorous now. Stricter ones, however, would require total support from all six of Iraq's neighbours - \"hard in the case of Jordan, Turkey and Syria. Turkey has lost a lot of trade,\" Mr Partrick says.</p> <p><b> \u0095 Travel restrictions</b></p> <p>The most successful example was the EU's ban on 600 named supporters of Serbia's former president, Slobodan Milosevic, which cut them off from their business activities around Europe. But such bans need support from a lot of countries and airlines, and can be evaded with false passports. Mr Saddam stays home.</p> <p><b> \u0095 Financial targeting</b></p> <p>Freezing the foreign bank accounts of regime leaders looks smart, but finding the accounts takes a lot of work.</p> <p>The tactic has had some impact elsewhere, but for a country with oil wealth it might prompt leaders simply to steal state funds, further depriving the Iraqi people of food and medicines.</p> <p><b> \u0095 Indictment</b></p> <p>Charging leaders with war crimes or crimes against humanity would be a clearly targeted move and one that countered any impression that an easing of economic sanctions meant weakness.</p> <p>The main issue here is timing. Actual arrests are unlikely in the near future and the threat of arrest might give the regime a further disincentive to make peace.</p> <p>\"It would not be particularly helpful while trying to get weapons inspectors in,\" Mr Partrick says.</p>",

But, says Gary Sick of the Middle East Institute at Columbia University in New York, \"it's really hard to come up with any kind of sanctions that people have not thought about in the last 10 years\" that would pile more pressure on Saddam Hussein without harming ordinary Iraqis. Neil Partrick, of the Royal United Services Institute in London, is equally sceptical about the search for \"smart\" sanctions: \"What is proposed is not so much genuinely smart as an attempt to make sanctions appear smarter and more presentable.\" Foreign Office sources acknowledge that smartness in presentation - grabbing the public relations initiative back from Saddam Hussein - will be at least as important as any changes in the sanctions. Gary Hufbauer, of the Washington-based Institute for International Economics, has studied smart - or targeted - sanctions dating back to 1932, and has found about 20 examples, usually implemented as part of a broader policy. Just five of these were successful in achieving their intended aims, he says - a worse record than the 34% success rate for sanctions in general during the 20th century. \"It's hard to say there's a silver bullet here,\" Mr Hufbauer says. \"But the silver bullet - if there is any - is that you're not imposing so much collateral damage on people who have no power.\" Sanctions against Haiti in the 1990s to restore democracy were an example of the knock-out approach. After a trade embargo, the UN stopped private flights, banned visas for the junta and froze Haitian assets. These failed to achieve a return to democracy; military intervention followed. The purpose of any sanctions against Iraq is going to be unchanged: to keep pressure on the regime until it lets UN inspectors return to monitor its weapons. Weekend reports that Iraq may be just three years from acquiring nuclear weapons, and another claiming that it secretly tested a bomb in 1989, have heightened the concern. But there is doubt whether Iraq will ever allow inspectors back, regardless of the pressure. Sir John Moberly, a former British ambassador to Jordan, believes that deterrence should be the focus, so that \"if Saddam starts to deploy nuclear, chemical or biological weapons he will risk being hit extremely hard by the United States or other UN security council members\". That, he goes on, would mean rebuilding a security council consensus on Iraq, bringing France, Russia and China back on board: \"Ease sanctions but agree on a response to Iraqi deployment of weapons.\" Two years ago a group of American foreign policy experts proposed a tougher plan: a \"systematic air campaign\" against President Saddam's Republican Guard and the setting up of an alternative government inside Iraq with US military and financial backing. Among this group were Donald Rumsfeld, now President Bush's defence secretary, Paul Wolfowitz, number two at the Pentagon, and Richard Armitage, number two at the state department. Such ideas, however, are not likely to appeal to the secretary of state, Colin Powell, who has said he believes the policy of containment is working. Targeting regime leaders is no simple matter This is what experts say about the pros and cons of ways to penalise Iraq: \u0095 Economic sanctions Nothing has done more to discredit economic sanctions than hold-ups in the delivery of essential goods to Iraq, on the grounds that they might have a military use. \"Sanctions that were genuinely smarter,\" says Neil Partrick, of the Royal United Services Institute in London, \"would shift the situation from saying that everything is forbidden, with certain exceptions, to saying that everything is permitted except some items, such as those with seriously potential dual use.\" Or, says Gary Sick of Columbia University, New York, don't allow unlimited quantities of dubious items. As for exports, all Iraqi oil revenue must go into a UN account. The UN is unlikely to relinquish this lever, as it uses part of the money to feed Iraq's Kurds and compensate victims of Baghdad's 1990 invasion of Kuwait - the act that unleashed the Gulf war and led to sanctions. But easing the policy on imports could be balanced by being tougher on smuggling, to stop illicit oil getting out and weapons getting in. Border checks are far from rigorous now. Stricter ones, however, would require total support from all six of Iraq's neighbours - \"hard in the case of Jordan, Turkey and Syria. Turkey has lost a lot of trade,\" Mr Partrick says. \u0095 Travel restrictions The most successful example was the EU's ban on 600 named supporters of Serbia's former president, Slobodan Milosevic, which cut them off from their business activities around Europe. But such bans need support from a lot of countries and airlines, and can be evaded with false passports. Mr Saddam stays home. \u0095 Financial targeting Freezing the foreign bank accounts of regime leaders looks smart, but finding the accounts takes a lot of work. The tactic has had some impact elsewhere, but for a country with oil wealth it might prompt leaders simply to steal state funds, further depriving the Iraqi people of food and medicines. \u0095 Indictment Charging leaders with war crimes or crimes against humanity would be a clearly targeted move and one that countered any impression that an easing of economic sanctions meant weakness. The main issue here is timing. Actual arrests are unlikely in the near future and the threat of arrest might give the regime a further disincentive to make peace. \"It would not be particularly helpful while trying to get weapons inspectors in,\" Mr Partrick says.",

News reaches WPM that council workers in this fair northern city are being sent on a two-and-a-half-hour course to teach them how to change a lightbulb. Dozens have attended the course, on which the council has spent an estimated \u00a34,000. A council spokesman said that the authority takes the Health and Safety Act very seriously and that it is the duty of any employer to provide such information and training as is necessary to ensure the safety of employees. </p> <p>But Martin Williams, an independent councillor on the authority said: \"The council needs to switch on to the fact that it is a laughing stock. This is just a crazy waste of time and effort.\" An entrepreneurial WPM would like to offer her services to the spendthrift council. She can teach you how to change a fuse for \u00a32k; how to swap bottles on the watercooler for a cool \u00a31k; and how to refill the photocopier for a bargain fifty quid. Cheap at the price, she's sure you'll agree, and a nice little money earner for her to boot. Now that really would be a bright idea. </p> <p>*We've had dress-down Friday, so how about a work-free Wednesday? The idea doesn't sound so unpalatable to WPM, who was quite taken with the idea of a \"stress-free day\" put forward by recruitment consultancy Media Contacts. The basic concept is that employees spend one day a week taking part in social activities organised by the boss. The nice people at Media Contacts say letting staff enjoy time off from heavy workloads and stringent deadlines could boost staff productivity. The company also claims that such initiatives could help combat the rising numbers of workers who are taking days off sick because of stress, as well as taking the pressure off bosses facing claims against them over employees' stress-related health problems. WPM would like to give her wholehearted endorsement to this brilliant idea, simply because it sounds like a euphemism for bumming about, doing nothing and getting paid for it. Splendid. </p> <p>*Generous to the last, WPM is happy to lend colleagues money, riches, even the shirt off her back, if she thinks it will be of use to the poor, less fortunate souls. What's hers is theirs. Until, of course, she decides they are taking liberties, and wants her wonga back. Such is the case with Sharon in accounts, who still hasn't refunded the 26p WPM put up for a Mars bar last November. </p> <p>Which is why WPM is aghast to learn that British bosses owe their employees \u00a3737m in unpaid expenses. A new report from BACS, the UK's automated financial clearing house, has said nearly 2m workers have to wait an unnecessary long time before expenses are paid. Most British businesses pay employees' salaries via the BACS Direct Credit electronic fund transfer service, which means they also have the facility to pay expenses direct into workers' bank accounts. However, the BACS survey found that 57% of companies still pay expenses by cheque, which means it takes longer for the funds to be available for withdrawal from the employees' account. Those sneaky sons-of-an-accountant are trying to pull a fast one. But they should be warned. Like Sharon in accounts, WPM' got their number. </p> <p>*WPM has always found something amusing about men in tight trousers. So imagine, if you can, her delight when she learned about the antics of staff at the Berwick-upon-Tweed Citizens Advice Bureau. Granted \u00a31,000 to spend on improving the working environment for its overstressed employees, it drafted in a counsellor to teach them how to relax. After weeks of practising positive statements about how it was going to be A Good Day, and listening to sage advice such as \"Drink less coffee\", bureau manager Jennifer Hall noticed that here was \u00a340 left in the kitty (these counsellors don't come cheap y'know; and then you've got to fork out for all those complimentary biscuits and extra jars of Nescafe). Presumably fed up with practising deep-breathing techniques and feng shui-ing the office, Jennifer blew the lot (well, almost) on some good old- fashioned Billy Connolly videos. She felt a little comic relief might do them as much good as all the yoga sun saluting. Customers have not been quite so happy about the bureau staff's new trend for cursing in a Glaswegian accent.</p>",

      "body": "<p>I'm not a great celeb spotter. I always find that the fantasy is nicer than the reality,\" says Jo Johnson, 23, production secretary for the Brit Awards. Often described as the pop industry's answer to the Oscars, the event - which takes place at Earls Court in London this evening - includes performances from some of the music industry's finest and most controversial artists. </p> <p>Johnson, who is based in Soho, has been working on the event since last November (her contract expires in a couple of weeks so she is already looking for her next job). Originally from Bristol, she studied design at Nottingham Trent University but has always been passionate about music. A regular face at college gigs and local record shops, she got roped into organising club nights, concerts and other live events during her student years. </p> <p>\"I was always told that it's all about who you know in the pop industry and I used to think, 'Who am I going to meet? I'm just a graduate from Nottingham Trent.'\" Luck was on her side. One of her contacts at college moved to London to work in music PR. \"That one contact led to so much and I got a job in the same PR company without making a formal application. My whole career since leaving university has been like that, and I know it's a clich\u00e9 but it really is true - it's all about who you know.\" </p> <p>Rehearsals have been going on for the past two days. Johnson's duties will include making final checks to ensure that all artists will be arriving on time, that they are happy in their hotels and that transport is booked to and from the venue. She is looking forward to meeting Eminem and U2. \"They are just people, but it would be incredible to see them because of the impact they've had on the globe - there are very few people in the world who wouldn't know a U2 song.\" </p> <p>The awards will be aired exactly 24 hours after taking place and Johnson will be on hand to make sure that the director and producer are looked after. \"On the day, they are going to be under such enormous pressure.

      "bodyText": "I'm not a great celeb spotter. I always find that the fantasy is nicer than the reality,\" says Jo Johnson, 23, production secretary for the Brit Awards. Often described as the pop industry's answer to the Oscars, the event - which takes place at Earls Court in London this evening - includes performances from some of the music industry's finest and most controversial artists. Johnson, who is based in Soho, has been working on the event since last November (her contract expires in a couple of weeks so she is already looking for her next job). Originally from Bristol, she studied design at Nottingham Trent University but has always been passionate about music. A regular face at college gigs and local record shops, she got roped into organising club nights, concerts and other live events during her student years. \"I was always told that it's all about who you know in the pop industry and I used to think, 'Who am I going to meet? I'm just a graduate from Nottingham Trent.'\" Luck was on her side. One of her contacts at college moved to London to work in music PR. \"That one contact led to so much and I got a job in the same PR company without making a formal application. My whole career since leaving university has been like that, and I know it's a clich\u00e9 but it really is true - it's all about who you know.\" Rehearsals have been going on for the past two days. Johnson's duties will include making final checks to ensure that all artists will be arriving on time, that they are happy in their hotels and that transport is booked to and from the venue. She is looking forward to meeting Eminem and U2. \"They are just people, but it would be incredible to see them because of the impact they've had on the globe - there are very few people in the world who wouldn't know a U2 song.\" The awards will be aired exactly 24 hours after taking place and Johnson will be on hand to make sure that the director and producer are looked after. \"On the day, they are going to be under such enormous pressure. I will be making sure that they have absolutely everything they need - it could be as simple as getting them some food, or making sure that they have some rest.\" All staff need to know exactly where they should be and what they should be doing on the night. Numbers run into hundreds, and Johnson's responsibility is not to be taken lightly. Issuing passes, distributing running orders and making sure everyone has updated contact sheets is all down to her.

      "body": "<b>Tina Woods, 36: Director of medical education company</b> <p> <b> 6.30am</b> One glass of orange juice, two cups of coffee with full fat milk. This is what the kids drink and skimmed milk tastes horrible in coffee! </p> <p><b> 8am</b> Secret half teaspoon of peanut butter - I've been on a diet for over a week now and I'm suffering withdrawal. I've gained two and a half stone since I had the kids and my target is to lose two by the summer. I'm being pragmatic about healthy eating, cutting out fat and trying to be more active, but I'm not sticking to any particular foods. I used to feel guilty and obsessive about eating chocolate and other bad foods, and I was close to being anorexic, but now I have a healthier body image. I think it's because I'm happier as a person and my attitude is more mature. But I still don't like wearing a bathing suit if I don't feel slim. </p> <p><b> 1pm</b> Chicken, bacon and salad sandwich but no butter or mayonnaise (usually do), no crisps (usually do). One can of Rio diet fizzy drink (I always get this because it includes 33% extra for free). I'm trying to get back into going to the gym - I used to go six times a week, including five aerobics sessions, right up till the last week of pregnancy, but when you're a working mother of two boys under five, that's difficult to do. I'm aiming for once a week at the moment. If you stop looking at your muscles in the mirror and comparing your body with other people in the gym, you don't think about your weight so much. </p> <p> <b> 7pm</b> Minestrone Slim-a-Soup (only 60 calories) and two halves of an oatcake that dropped on the floor after the kids raided the cupboard for a snack . Half a bite of chicken nugget that they haven't eaten. Remember by second bite that I shouldn't be eating chicken nuggets - habits are not easily broken. When I had children, I discovered I was unconsciously finishing the food on their plates. That put on a few pounds and breast-feeding means you keep the weight on, too. The other reason is that after you have kids, self is not a priority, so body image is less important. </p> <p> <b> 9.30pm </b> Loads of lettuce, leftover pork chop from two nights ago, leftover mushrooms from last week (yikes, they must be used up by tonight and I hate wasting food). One slice of leftover potato and parsnip, and a spoonful of mashed potato from my husband's plate to remind myself how delicious it tastes. I didn't grow up in a family in which we were force-fed the last morsels on our plates; my desire to use up every scrap of leftover food stems from a need to control things. I get irritated if I make too much because it shows I haven't planned well. </p> <p><b> 10.30pm</b> Do not allow myself leftover mash. One glass diet tonic with ice and lemon (in a nice glass to try to fool myself it is almost as good as my usual stiff gin and tonic, which is fattening and reduces my willpower). Lots of fizzy water. ( Do not have two glasses of wine.) </p> <p><b> 11pm</b> Diet hot chocolate. Three big spoonfuls to make it seem creamy. <br><br><b>Allegra McEvedy, 30: Food writer and chef at The Good Cook restaurant in west London</b></p> <p><b> 8.30am</b> Cup of Earl Grey in bed. Two teabags, one sugar and a good shot of milk - organic semi-skimmed. I've never been able to kick sugar in tea, but I use unrefined because it contains beneficial trace elements. </p> <p><b> 9.30am</b> I have no pattern for breakfast - if I'm cooking or writing at home, I'll skip it altogether, but this week I've got a friend over from NYC, Jodi, who is bonkers about crumpets (not available in Brooklyn). I've recently scored some fantastic Turkish honeycomb, so crumpets and honey make a great start to the day. </p> <p><b> 2pm </b> Lunch is another variable: if I'm on a shoot or a deadline, I won't stop. One good thing about having a guest is you tend to punctuate your day with meals at the correct time. Left to my own devices, I often won't eat until late afternoon. Take Jodi to the Honest Cabbage in Bermondsey, which is like a gastro pub without the pub bit. Being a good New York girl, she has a salad, but I go for calves' liver with black pudding and French beans. I suppose black pudding isn't exactly good for you but it tastes fantastic. Drink a pint of bitter and two glasses of water. </p> <p><b> 4pm</b> Take Jodi and Alfie, my three-year-old nephew, to Tate Modern. Alfie gets bored, so the two of us go to the cafeteria. Alfie goes into a mantra about chips and gets lucky: I'm a Good Aunt - and I know I'm not responsible for his overall diet. </p> <p><b> 6.30pm</b> It's London fashion week and a friend is showing his collection. I don't eat anything, but it's worth a mention because it illustrates the antithesis of my attitude. Six-foot women with alien bodies. I look at them quizzically rather than enviously. My mum was one of those fabulous homey cooks who had a fridge magnet saying: \"Life is uncertain, eat pudding first.\" Admittedly, times have changed and, more specifically, my life has changed - I'm in development for a TV series and more than one person has pointed out that the camera puts 8lb on you. So I've been going to the gym, drinking lots of water, rationing alcohol, keeping fruit in the house and chocolate out. I'm one of the least calorie-counting people I know - I think you can tell whether something is good for you. </p> <p><b> 9pm</b> Make dinner at home. Out of four of us eating, two are chefs, so we take a course each. I make a herby ful madamas (Middle Eastern broad bean) salad, backed with a healthy amount of chilli. Fred scours the fridge for soup ingredients and comes up with a delicious number involving chicken stock I made yesterday, salami, baby spinach and the new season's garlic. The meal was perfect, delicious and healthy. Sometimes I feel Sarah, my partner, headhunted me because she loves good food but doesn't feel au fait in the kitchen. I have a passion for food and live to eat. I'd be upset if I got to sumo proportions, but I believe you should do what feels right for you - after all, you are what you eat. <br><br> <b>Clara Coleridge, 25: Editorial assistant at handbag.com</b> </p> <p> <b> 8am</b> Muesli with milk. This is what I have for breakfast most days, because I like it and also because I reckon the fibre's pretty healthy. Generally I'm not that hungry in the morning. If I'm late leaving for work and/or hungover, I'll skip the muesli and buy take-out croissant or toast to eat at my desk. </p> <p><b> 11am</b> Tangerine. My flatmate had bought a bag, so I've brought one to work. I haven't eaten one since Christmas and I love the taste, but also I think I should eat some fruit because I don't buy it that often. I know you're supposed to have five portions a day and I don't think about fulfilling that every day, but I do enjoy healthy food when I eat it. </p> <p><b> 12.30pm</b> Microwave-able Asda chicken in caesar sauce with bacon and pasta. I only eat half of this because it's too rich and a bit yucky. I don't have a problem with leaving food on my plate, probably because I went to boarding school and still have nightmares about being sent back to table because I hadn't finished what was on my tray. You had no choice over what you ate and often just had to hold your nose and get it down your throat. Either that or spit it into your napkin. Then I'd cheer myself up with Mum's home-made biscuits in my tuck box. When I was a teenager I went to a girls' boarding school and that was even worse because it was fashionable to be anorexic. I wasn't, but I used to have to pretend to be on a diet like everyone else. Often the dining room would be pretty empty, so many girls were starving themselves. Now at lunchtime, I might bring in a sandwich from home but normally I'll eat it too early, then want a second lunch later. </p> <p><b> 4pm</b> Packet of paprika crisps. I bought these from Boots in my lunch hour. They're my favourite flavour and I was worried because I noticed they were running out. I didn't trust myself to buy two packets because I might eat both. So I hid a couple of packets in the salt and vinegar flavour box for later. Usually at this time I think about some kind of snack. If I'm going out for drinks in the evening, supper might get forgotten about, so I'll grab a sausage roll or something at my desk. </p> <p><b> 7.30pm</b> Get home and have a slice of cheese and a few bits of ham from the fridge with a glass of wine. I tend to eat according to my mood, I don't diet. After a hangover, I might just eat pizza all day. I once joined a gym but got depressed at using all this equipment with nothing to do but watch EastEnders with the sound turned down. Then I only went to the sauna, so I stopped going and now I run up escalators for exercise. When I was 18, I used to compare myself with skinny, beautiful models but I've got over that now. What's important is to be healthy and active. In my job, we are bombarded with images of models, but we try to use only ones who are a healthy weight. </p> <p><b> 8.30pm</b> Chicken (again!) with mini roasted potatoes and mange-tout, followed by apple crumble and cream. My two flatmates and I did a bulk shop and cooked a meal for two other friends. Everything is home-made and really nice. I haven't had pudding for ages. If I'm in the supermarket, I couldn't buy a whole cake unless I was having a tea, because I know if I did then I'd finish it all and feel sick. Lots of water pre-bed (after about five glasses of wine). <br><br><b>Darshan Kent, 44: Assistant to partner in management consultancy </b></p> <p><b> 7.30am </b> Arrive early at work. Grapes and sharon fruit. Eighteen months ago, I made a decision to start eating fruit for breakfast and cut out bread and cheese. The reason? The guy who sits next to me turned round one day and asked: \"Why are you so fat?\" In an office, people do tend to notice colleagues' eating habits. He told me where he saw me going wrong and pointed out that yeast makes some people bloated. Now I call him my dietitian, I have a bowl of fruit on my desk and I've lost a stone and a half just by doing that. I've always been happy with myself, so I would never go on a diet, and I never weigh myself - it doesn't do you any good. </p> <p><b> 8am</b> Coffee. Normally I just drink hot water, but I worked for 16 hours yesterday at a conference and need a boost. </p> <p><b> 9am</b> Cafe latte made with skimmed milk - I don't like the taste of full fat. </p> <p><b> 11am</b> Three plums. Fruit fills me up in a different way from bread; there is a lightness to it and it's very refreshing. I don't bring in boring things like apples, I try to go for nice, exotic types. I buy cases of sharon fruit from my greengrocer, he's got to know me very well. </p> <p> <b> 12.30pm</b> Go out for coffee with friends. I don't like to eat with them because it gets in the way of talking! </p> <p> <b> 2pm</b> Eat lunch at my desk. Normally I have a massive salad but there isn't much left in the canteen so I have to settle for a jacket potato with tuna. It's horrible. We've got a new chef and his hot meals smell tempting, but I know afterwards I'll be disappointed - hot food at lunchtime is always like that and can be greasy. If I feel in the mood for something naughty, like chips, I'll go right ahead and have them. Life is for living, you shouldn't feel guilty. </p> <p><b> 4pm</b> Kiwi fruit and a banana. At this time of day, I need a pep-up. </p> <p><b> 8pm</b> Coffee and a chocolate biscuit at my teacher's house (I've recently started a degree in business studies). If I want chocolate, I'll have it. You can diet till you drop dead but it won't make much difference. Usually people revert to the body type they are born with. I go to the gym three times a week - it used to be six but I don't have time now I'm studying. </p> <p><b> 10pm</b> Mediterranean vegetable casserole, with peppers and aubergines and plain boiled rice, then a plate of sharon fruit. Made by my 19-year-old daughter, who is the best cook in the world. Unlike me, she eats meat. I became vegetarian 20 years ago. I used to be vegan but started eating fish and eggs recently and feel more energised now. I think I wasn't getting enough nutrients before. My parents didn't bring me up to eat healthily - I wish I'd known years ago what I know now. Now we never eat frozen vegetables, it's just as quick to cook fresh. </p> <p><b> 11pm</b> Glass of hot water. I do drink alcohol - on Fridays, that's my drinking day. A group of us go to a wine bar that does a special offer on a magnum of champagne. <br><br>\u0095 Michele Hanson returns next week.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Tina Woods, 36: Director of medical education company 6.30am One glass of orange juice, two cups of coffee with full fat milk. This is what the kids drink and skimmed milk tastes horrible in coffee! 8am Secret half teaspoon of peanut butter - I've been on a diet for over a week now and I'm suffering withdrawal. I've gained two and a half stone since I had the kids and my target is to lose two by the summer. I'm being pragmatic about healthy eating, cutting out fat and trying to be more active, but I'm not sticking to any particular foods. I used to feel guilty and obsessive about eating chocolate and other bad foods, and I was close to being anorexic, but now I have a healthier body image. I think it's because I'm happier as a person and my attitude is more mature. But I still don't like wearing a bathing suit if I don't feel slim. 1pm Chicken, bacon and salad sandwich but no butter or mayonnaise (usually do), no crisps (usually do). One can of Rio diet fizzy drink (I always get this because it includes 33% extra for free). I'm trying to get back into going to the gym - I used to go six times a week, including five aerobics sessions, right up till the last week of pregnancy, but when you're a working mother of two boys under five, that's difficult to do. I'm aiming for once a week at the moment. If you stop looking at your muscles in the mirror and comparing your body with other people in the gym, you don't think about your weight so much. 7pm Minestrone Slim-a-Soup (only 60 calories) and two halves of an oatcake that dropped on the floor after the kids raided the cupboard for a snack . Half a bite of chicken nugget that they haven't eaten. Remember by second bite that I shouldn't be eating chicken nuggets - habits are not easily broken. When I had children, I discovered I was unconsciously finishing the food on their plates. That put on a few pounds and breast-feeding means you keep the weight on, too. The other reason is that after you have kids, self is not a priority, so body image is less important. 9.30pm Loads of lettuce, leftover pork chop from two nights ago, leftover mushrooms from last week (yikes, they must be used up by tonight and I hate wasting food). One slice of leftover potato and parsnip, and a spoonful of mashed potato from my husband's plate to remind myself how delicious it tastes. I didn't grow up in a family in which we were force-fed the last morsels on our plates; my desire to use up every scrap of leftover food stems from a need to control things. I get irritated if I make too much because it shows I haven't planned well. 10.30pm Do not allow myself leftover mash. One glass diet tonic with ice and lemon (in a nice glass to try to fool myself it is almost as good as my usual stiff gin and tonic, which is fattening and reduces my willpower). Lots of fizzy water. ( Do not have two glasses of wine.) 11pm Diet hot chocolate. Three big spoonfuls to make it seem creamy. Allegra McEvedy, 30: Food writer and chef at The Good Cook restaurant in west London 8.30am Cup of Earl Grey in bed. Two teabags, one sugar and a good shot of milk - organic semi-skimmed. I've never been able to kick sugar in tea, but I use unrefined because it contains beneficial trace elements. 9.30am I have no pattern for breakfast - if I'm cooking or writing at home, I'll skip it altogether, but this week I've got a friend over from NYC, Jodi, who is bonkers about crumpets (not available in Brooklyn). I've recently scored some fantastic Turkish honeycomb, so crumpets and honey make a great start to the day. 2pm Lunch is another variable: if I'm on a shoot or a deadline, I won't stop. One good thing about having a guest is you tend to punctuate your day with meals at the correct time. Left to my own devices, I often won't eat until late afternoon. Take Jodi to the Honest Cabbage in Bermondsey, which is like a gastro pub without the pub bit. Being a good New York girl, she has a salad, but I go for calves' liver with black pudding and French beans. I suppose black pudding isn't exactly good for you but it tastes fantastic. Drink a pint of bitter and two glasses of water. 4pm Take Jodi and Alfie, my three-year-old nephew, to Tate Modern. Alfie gets bored, so the two of us go to the cafeteria. Alfie goes into a mantra about chips and gets lucky: I'm a Good Aunt - and I know I'm not responsible for his overall diet. 6.30pm It's London fashion week and a friend is showing his collection. I don't eat anything, but it's worth a mention because it illustrates the antithesis of my attitude. Six-foot women with alien bodies. I look at them quizzically rather than enviously. My mum was one of those fabulous homey cooks who had a fridge magnet saying: \"Life is uncertain, eat pudding first.\" Admittedly, times have changed and, more specifically, my life has changed - I'm in development for a TV series and more than one person has pointed out that the camera puts 8lb on you. So I've been going to the gym, drinking lots of water, rationing alcohol, keeping fruit in the house and chocolate out. I'm one of the least calorie-counting people I know - I think you can tell whether something is good for you. 9pm Make dinner at home. Out of four of us eating, two are chefs, so we take a course each. I make a herby ful madamas (Middle Eastern broad bean) salad, backed with a healthy amount of chilli. Fred scours the fridge for soup ingredients and comes up with a delicious number involving chicken stock I made yesterday, salami, baby spinach and the new season's garlic. The meal was perfect, delicious and healthy. Sometimes I feel Sarah, my partner, headhunted me because she loves good food but doesn't feel au fait in the kitchen. I have a passion for food and live to eat. I'd be upset if I got to sumo proportions, but I believe you should do what feels right for you - after all, you are what you eat. Clara Coleridge, 25: Editorial assistant at handbag.com 8am Muesli with milk. This is what I have for breakfast most days, because I like it and also because I reckon the fibre's pretty healthy. Generally I'm not that hungry in the morning. If I'm late leaving for work and/or hungover, I'll skip the muesli and buy take-out croissant or toast to eat at my desk. 11am Tangerine. My flatmate had bought a bag, so I've brought one to work. I haven't eaten one since Christmas and I love the taste, but also I think I should eat some fruit because I don't buy it that often. I know you're supposed to have five portions a day and I don't think about fulfilling that every day, but I do enjoy healthy food when I eat it. 12.30pm Microwave-able Asda chicken in caesar sauce with bacon and pasta. I only eat half of this because it's too rich and a bit yucky. I don't have a problem with leaving food on my plate, probably because I went to boarding school and still have nightmares about being sent back to table because I hadn't finished what was on my tray. You had no choice over what you ate and often just had to hold your nose and get it down your throat. Either that or spit it into your napkin. Then I'd cheer myself up with Mum's home-made biscuits in my tuck box. When I was a teenager I went to a girls' boarding school and that was even worse because it was fashionable to be anorexic. I wasn't, but I used to have to pretend to be on a diet like everyone else. Often the dining room would be pretty empty, so many girls were starving themselves. Now at lunchtime, I might bring in a sandwich from home but normally I'll eat it too early, then want a second lunch later. 4pm Packet of paprika crisps. I bought these from Boots in my lunch hour. They're my favourite flavour and I was worried because I noticed they were running out. I didn't trust myself to buy two packets because I might eat both. So I hid a couple of packets in the salt and vinegar flavour box for later. Usually at this time I think about some kind of snack.

The shop spawned a distribution network that changed the face of music in this country, and the record label that brought us such influential groups as the Smiths and the Fall. </p> <p>An awful lot of people are getting very nostalgic about Rough Trade. Mute is releasing a 50-track CD featuring acts, from Nick Cave to the Chemical Brothers, that owe something to Rough Trade, while London's Rough Trade shops (there are now two of them) are presenting 10 days of live music at various venues across the capital. Young Marble Giants are reforming after 20 years, and the whole thing promises to be a marvellous - if slightly misty-eyed - affair. </p> <p>One man won't be too nostalgic. Ten years after the label and distribution side of Rough Trade went into receivership, Geoff Travis has other things to take care of. He has bought back the record label name from indie operation One Little Indian and is starting again. \"I'm pleased about the anniversary because I don't have to do very much,\" laughs Travis, ensconced in his new offices in London's Golborne Road. \"I would feel really weird if I was just looking back, but I'm as excited as I've ever been.\" </p> <p>Already, rave notices have greeted his new signings David Kitt and New York rockers the Strokes, with the latter generating the kind of hubbub that once surrounded the Smiths. \"We're having sleepless nights about the Strokes,\" says Travis. \"When they played last week, people told me it was among the top 10 gigs they'd been to in their lives.\" </p> <p>The record scene certainly needs this sort of enthusiasm. Perhaps the most intriguing aspect of Rough Trade's re-emergence as a label is that the industry is in almost exactly the same condition as when Travis started his shop at 202 Kensington Road, pushing Television, Blondie and reggae imports. Again, big companies dominate, peddling manufactured, cynically backward-looking sounds to a generation of buyers who don't know there is an alternative. But having started as a cottage industry and taken on the world, is Travis in a position to do it all again? </p> <p>\"I've already made mis takes,\" he admits. \"At the moment, for example, the whole thing is funded by me, which is insane.\" </p> <p>British music would have been very different if Travis hadn't hitch-hiked around America in 1975, and returned with the crateloads of records he used - as well as \u00a34,000 from his father - to start the Rough Trade shop. It became a focal point for the emerging punk and DIY culture, as Travis championed records by the likes of Scritti Politti and Desperate Bicycles, whose motto was: \"It's easy, it's cheap - go and do it.\" Bands formed in the shop and independent empires began there. One early customer was Daniel Miller, who walked in with a tape of his band the Normal. Travis paid for 2,000 copies to be pressed, and Miller founded the Mute label, which has since sold millions with Depeche Mode and Moby. Rough Trade became a record label after French punk band Metal Urbain realised that some shop in London was importing hundreds of their Panique single. They presented Travis with a tape of their next effort, Paris Maquis, and asked him to put it out. </p> <p>Like Factory's Tony Wilson, Travis was a Cambridge-educated \"pseudo- intellectual\" grounded in political theory. Teaming up with similar regional record shops such as Red Rhino in York and Probe in Liverpool, he devised a national network capable of distributing the music. In those days Rough Trade was run as a co-op, with everybody on the same money, although Travis led music policy as a \"benevolent dictator\". </p> <p>The label's first album, Inflammable Material by Stiff Little Fingers, shifted 100,000 copies and was sold in Asda, an astonishing feat for an album with a sleeve that looked like a bomb. For years, unveiling innovative bands from the Raincoats to Aztec Camera, Rough Trade ran riot in the music industry, with a combination of instinct and sheer gall. Cabaret Voltaire were lured to the label with the promise of a drum machine; the Smiths for just \u00a34,000. Many groups were won over by Rough Trade's 50/50 profit split between artist and label. </p> <p>By the mid-1980s, the label had become more professional, winning awards for its marketing campaigns, which helped the Smiths reach number one but enraged indie purists. Eventually, the pressure of constantly battling the mainstream took its toll. From Stiff Little Fingers to the Smiths (who decamped to EMI but split before recording a note, to Travis's delight), the record label had always lost bands to the majors' chequebooks, but had either \"made money, or lost a little bit\". But, unbeknown to Travis, the distribution end was in trouble. </p> <p>\"Fundamentally, it got too big too quickly for the people running that side of the business,\" Travis claims. \"Human nature being what it is, nobody said, 'Help, we're drowning.'\" </p> <p>Thus, in 1991 Travis's entire empire - apart from the shop, which had been handed over to its workers in 1983 - went down \"like a pack of cards\". As the entire back catalogue was sold to pay off debts, Travis says he was left \"like Morrissey sang, 'without a stitch to wear' \", although he has since done far better than most of the Rough Trade workers who were made redundant. In the 1990s Travis managed, among others, Pulp and the Cranberries. He also devoted energies to Blanco Y Negro, the Warner subsidiary he set up in 1983 to work with independent bands such as the Jesus and Mary Chain and Everything But the Girl, who sought help in making the difficult transition to a major label. He is now overseeing the debut album from Elizabeth Fraser of the Cocteau Twins. But even Travis's keenest admirers concede that the man can be fickle, flitting from cause to cause like a bee from flower to flower. However, he seems sincere when he says his heart is with Rough Trade. </p> <p>Rough Trade's revival comes at an intriguing time for independent music. Following years of fake \"indies\" set up by the majors to make their bands look cool, genuine independents - such as Domino and City Slang - are again infiltrating the top 20, retaining Rough Trade's blueprint of a 50/50 profit split. There are also scores of dance independents. \"There's a real line now between what a major label wants and what an independent label wants,\" says Travis's former protege, Mute's Daniel Miller. \"Hopefully, artists and some managers will now understand that there are two ways of working. One is huge advance, lots of money for the video, and if it doesn't work - fuck off. The other one is not a big advance, not a big marketing spend, but the right approach for the right group, who will hopefully grow over the space of a few albums.\" </p> <p>Perhaps, as Travis says of 1976, there are again \"possibilities in the air\". He is already enthusing about his next great new band, the Mouldy Beaches, whom he describes as \"a fantastic cross between Beck and the Television Personalities, with really outrageous but endearing songs\". </p> <p>\"It was never about having hits,\" says Travis. \"It was about making fantastic records. There are still amazing things in music; you've just got to look for them. My job is to make that process easier.\" </p> <p>\u0095 Rough Trade Shops: 25 Years, is released on March 5 on Mute. The 25th anniversary concerts continue tonight with Jeb Loy Nichols and Grand Drive at Cargo, London EC2 (020-7739 3440), and Evan Dando at ULU, London WC1 (020-7664 2000).</p>",

Teaming up with similar regional record shops such as Red Rhino in York and Probe in Liverpool, he devised a national network capable of distributing the music. In those days Rough Trade was run as a co-op, with everybody on the same money, although Travis led music policy as a \"benevolent dictator\". The label's first album, Inflammable Material by Stiff Little Fingers, shifted 100,000 copies and was sold in Asda, an astonishing feat for an album with a sleeve that looked like a bomb. For years, unveiling innovative bands from the Raincoats to Aztec Camera, Rough Trade ran riot in the music industry, with a combination of instinct and sheer gall. Cabaret Voltaire were lured to the label with the promise of a drum machine; the Smiths for just \u00a34,000. Many groups were won over by Rough Trade's 50/50 profit split between artist and label. By the mid-1980s, the label had become more professional, winning awards for its marketing campaigns, which helped the Smiths reach number one but enraged indie purists. Eventually, the pressure of constantly battling the mainstream took its toll. From Stiff Little Fingers to the Smiths (who decamped to EMI but split before recording a note, to Travis's delight), the record label had always lost bands to the majors' chequebooks, but had either \"made money, or lost a little bit\". But, unbeknown to Travis, the distribution end was in trouble. \"Fundamentally, it got too big too quickly for the people running that side of the business,\" Travis claims. \"Human nature being what it is, nobody said, 'Help, we're drowning.'\" Thus, in 1991 Travis's entire empire - apart from the shop, which had been handed over to its workers in 1983 - went down \"like a pack of cards\". As the entire back catalogue was sold to pay off debts, Travis says he was left \"like Morrissey sang, 'without a stitch to wear' \", although he has since done far better than most of the Rough Trade workers who were made redundant. In the 1990s Travis managed, among others, Pulp and the Cranberries. He also devoted energies to Blanco Y Negro, the Warner subsidiary he set up in 1983 to work with independent bands such as the Jesus and Mary Chain and Everything But the Girl, who sought help in making the difficult transition to a major label. He is now overseeing the debut album from Elizabeth Fraser of the Cocteau Twins. But even Travis's keenest admirers concede that the man can be fickle, flitting from cause to cause like a bee from flower to flower. However, he seems sincere when he says his heart is with Rough Trade. Rough Trade's revival comes at an intriguing time for independent music. Following years of fake \"indies\" set up by the majors to make their bands look cool, genuine independents - such as Domino and City Slang - are again infiltrating the top 20, retaining Rough Trade's blueprint of a 50/50 profit split. There are also scores of dance independents. \"There's a real line now between what a major label wants and what an independent label wants,\" says Travis's former protege, Mute's Daniel Miller. \"Hopefully, artists and some managers will now understand that there are two ways of working. One is huge advance, lots of money for the video, and if it doesn't work - fuck off. The other one is not a big advance, not a big marketing spend, but the right approach for the right group, who will hopefully grow over the space of a few albums.\" Perhaps, as Travis says of 1976, there are again \"possibilities in the air\". He is already enthusing about his next great new band, the Mouldy Beaches, whom he describes as \"a fantastic cross between Beck and the Television Personalities, with really outrageous but endearing songs\". \"It was never about having hits,\" says Travis. \"It was about making fantastic records. There are still amazing things in music; you've just got to look for them. My job is to make that process easier.\" \u0095 Rough Trade Shops: 25 Years, is released on March 5 on Mute. The 25th anniversary concerts continue tonight with Jeb Loy Nichols and Grand Drive at Cargo, London EC2 (020-7739 3440), and Evan Dando at ULU, London WC1 (020-7664 2000).",

      "body": "<p>There was a famous row in the 1980s when it was revealed that MI5 maintained an office in the BBC for the purposes of vetting staff. The spymasters were subsequently evicted, and promises given that desk-space would be restricted to those working in television. It increasingly feels, though, that the Metropolitan Police is sub-letting premises within Television Centre. </p> <p>Crimewatch UK, which screens its February edition this week, has not only survived the extraordinary circumstances of the murder of its co-presenter, Jill Dando, but has encouraged a copycat morning programme, Crimewatch Daily. These animated wanted posters have long been an obsession of this column because of the departure from usual BBC editorial policy, which they often seem to represent. </p> <p>In most areas of politics, the BBC correctly insists on balance, a commitment fiercely policed by the thick red lines of editorial felt-tip. Yet, though law enforcement is a huge political issue, the force seems assured of what you might call copper-bottomed support. Crimewatch UK and its new partner in crime-detection surely offer a romanticised picture of the both the methods and detection rate of the police. </p> <p>Though the confidence in the forces is probably - after the Lawrence case and McPherson Report - lower than at any time in history, BBC1 is currently running 21 editions each month of shows which feature unfailingly polite, diligent, sensitive and, where possible, multi-ethnic detectives. </p> <p>Serious analysis of the police is left to news programmes and dramas such as Tony Garnett's Cops, where bent and racist coppers are to be found, but with the inevitable implication that such disgraces to the uniform are only fictional. </p> <p>The criminal softness towards cops in magazine and documentary output is especially worthy of investigation because it was factual programmes on the BBC - through Roger Graef's justly famous series Police - which first exposed the troubling assumptions of many officers. </p> <p>Raw Blues, BBC1's new cop-observing series, which starts this week, has nothing to do with Graef, but any DNA test would find the fingerprints of his inspiration. The problem is that Graef caught the police unawares, like burglars in the early days of CCTV who were amazed when their denials were silenced with snapshots of them climbing through the window. When Police was made, no one understood how damning the cameras could be. But the police now regard TV as a photo-opportunity, and show their best face. </p> <p>Scheduled suspiciously shoulder-to-shoulder on Wednesday between Crimewatch UK and Crimewatch UK Update, Raw Blues frequently feels as if it could have been made by the Met as a recruitment video. The opening shots, admittedly, are surprising and apparently damning. It's before dawn in London and police have a problem with a stabbing victim. The man, who is black, stands in the street, his body patched with red like a stigmatic. He refuses, though, to let the police help him. Bizarrely stealing their lines, he commands: \"I want to see you now against the wall.\" The implication is shocking and clear. After Lawrence and McPherson, a black stabbing victim sees the arrival of the police as a moment of danger. As their car shrieks near, sirens go off in his mind. </p> <p>This feels a Graef-like moment. But it soon becomes clear that we've picked the wrong film out of the identity parade. The documentary's initial pessimism is merely a downpayment on optimism, as the scene switches to a proud exhibit for the defence. At Hendon Police College, the latest recruits are arriving.

      "bodyText": "There was a famous row in the 1980s when it was revealed that MI5 maintained an office in the BBC for the purposes of vetting staff. The spymasters were subsequently evicted, and promises given that desk-space would be restricted to those working in television. It increasingly feels, though, that the Metropolitan Police is sub-letting premises within Television Centre. Crimewatch UK, which screens its February edition this week, has not only survived the extraordinary circumstances of the murder of its co-presenter, Jill Dando, but has encouraged a copycat morning programme, Crimewatch Daily. These animated wanted posters have long been an obsession of this column because of the departure from usual BBC editorial policy, which they often seem to represent. In most areas of politics, the BBC correctly insists on balance, a commitment fiercely policed by the thick red lines of editorial felt-tip. Yet, though law enforcement is a huge political issue, the force seems assured of what you might call copper-bottomed support. Crimewatch UK and its new partner in crime-detection surely offer a romanticised picture of the both the methods and detection rate of the police. Though the confidence in the forces is probably - after the Lawrence case and McPherson Report - lower than at any time in history, BBC1 is currently running 21 editions each month of shows which feature unfailingly polite, diligent, sensitive and, where possible, multi-ethnic detectives. Serious analysis of the police is left to news programmes and dramas such as Tony Garnett's Cops, where bent and racist coppers are to be found, but with the inevitable implication that such disgraces to the uniform are only fictional. The criminal softness towards cops in magazine and documentary output is especially worthy of investigation because it was factual programmes on the BBC - through Roger Graef's justly famous series Police - which first exposed the troubling assumptions of many officers. Raw Blues, BBC1's new cop-observing series, which starts this week, has nothing to do with Graef, but any DNA test would find the fingerprints of his inspiration. The problem is that Graef caught the police unawares, like burglars in the early days of CCTV who were amazed when their denials were silenced with snapshots of them climbing through the window. When Police was made, no one understood how damning the cameras could be. But the police now regard TV as a photo-opportunity, and show their best face. Scheduled suspiciously shoulder-to-shoulder on Wednesday between Crimewatch UK and Crimewatch UK Update, Raw Blues frequently feels as if it could have been made by the Met as a recruitment video. The opening shots, admittedly, are surprising and apparently damning. It's before dawn in London and police have a problem with a stabbing victim. The man, who is black, stands in the street, his body patched with red like a stigmatic. He refuses, though, to let the police help him. Bizarrely stealing their lines, he commands: \"I want to see you now against the wall.\" The implication is shocking and clear. After Lawrence and McPherson, a black stabbing victim sees the arrival of the police as a moment of danger. As their car shrieks near, sirens go off in his mind. This feels a Graef-like moment. But it soon becomes clear that we've picked the wrong film out of the identity parade. The documentary's initial pessimism is merely a downpayment on optimism, as the scene switches to a proud exhibit for the defence. At Hendon Police College, the latest recruits are arriving. A stern instructor warns that anyone who's \"racist, sexist, homophobic or who's a bully\" should walk out of the room. Cynics or readers of McPherson might feel at this point that police would be needed to control the stampede. But the cameras are present and the speech is, anyway, advertising rhetoric. From this moment, the documentary is dead. You always feel that the police are letting us see what they want us to see, as surely as if they were printing posters. In Graef's day, people were so naive about TV that they behaved naturally. Now most know to be vile in private. Candour does occasionally peep through the cracks in the PR fa\u00e7ade. It's intriguing that, despite the speeches about exclusivity, some intolerances are still accepted. Classism, for example. Mike, a graduate entrant, is clearly despised by his tutors as a toff.

And that's before the stinking legacy of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand or matters Italian get tossed in the pot. Dirty old times round a dirty old world.</p> <p>Who can doubt (with the leader writer of the Daily Mail this weekend) that, against such a background, \"the British experience may seem almost pristine\"? Have we a home-grown \"philandering scoundrel\" to match the ex-president of the United States for \"tawdriness and venality\"? Against the \"dishonesty and deceit of European politics\", the travails of Peter Mandelson and Derry Irvine \"hardly register on the Richter scale of sleaze\".</p> <p>Well, jolly good - though, this being the Mail, Tony Blair and the \"arrogance of New Labour\" naturally get their warning bumps along the way. Nevertheless, Britain starts this election with the comforting assumption that, compared to the damned foreigners, our escutcheon is pretty blot free. Charges of sleaze will be thrown around - they usually are - but the body politic can cope.</p> <p>To which there are two vital responses. One involves a little thoughtfulness about the nature of corruption itself and the way the media pack chooses its targets. Mr Clinton, for instance, may have been an idiot over his 171 pardons, but none of the money involved is yet tied to him personally and he didn't invent the practice of dishing out free exit passes to the rich and powerful. His brother-in-law spent eight barren years while Hillary was in the White House not getting rich.</p> <p>The fascination of this business, for the moment, is observing the way that those who leave office (especially working-class boys from the wrong state and the wrong school) get shafted once they lose power. Those who inherit that power, meanwhile, seem to have very few questions asked. I was baffled in the States last year to understand why vice-president Cheney's pay-off from the big oil company he ran, and the stock options he continued to hold, didn't make it beyond page 327 of the New York Times. Thirty million dollars seemed a tidy sum. But Dick, like George W, was a coming man. Dick can now be made America's energy supremo, among other things, and nobody blinks. Perhaps they're right - or perhaps we shall only hear about it again much later. But the moving finger, to these eyes anyway, writes in a baffling scrawl.</p> <p>The other response, however, starts and stays much nearer to home. It is rooted in that fundamental assumption of relative cleanliness which still underpins the attitudes of our great and good leaders - best shown, a few years ago, when a supposedly investigating cabinet secretary chose to believe Jonathan Aitken's wholly mendacious account of events without even an ephemeral check - because the minister had given his word. We believe ourselves \"almost pristine\". We discern few tremors on our Richter scale.</p> <p>There is, in sum, a curious dislocation between experience and expectation. Take Robert Maxwell. He is history, a scoundrel 10 years in his grave: the amazingly delayed DTI report into his dealings seems to be history, too. Nobody in particular gets blamed and those who collect modest opprobrium are dead anyway. The ocean of assumption remains blissfully calm. Such things, in our benign mantra, can never happen again.</p> <p>Equally, when Mohamed Al Fayed blows the whistle on a bevy of corrupt MPs, the boomerang comes back with predictable complacency. Who doled out the cash for questions in the first place? Why, Mr Fayed: what a very unsuitable British citizen! Yet no one has the spunk to recall that we only knew about these dealings because Mr Fayed told us so in the first place.</p> <p>Another great old British tradition: abuse the whistleblower and make yourself feel better, cloak the past and the dead in benevolence.

      "bodyText": "We live in dirty old times. There is Bill Clinton and his pardons, Jacques Chirac and his deals, Helmut Kohl and his party cash; there is Yoshiro Mori and some dubious Japanese cronies, Bulent Ecevit and some dodgy Turkish ministers. And that's before the stinking legacy of Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand or matters Italian get tossed in the pot. Dirty old times round a dirty old world. Who can doubt (with the leader writer of the Daily Mail this weekend) that, against such a background, \"the British experience may seem almost pristine\"? Have we a home-grown \"philandering scoundrel\" to match the ex-president of the United States for \"tawdriness and venality\"? Against the \"dishonesty and deceit of European politics\", the travails of Peter Mandelson and Derry Irvine \"hardly register on the Richter scale of sleaze\". Well, jolly good - though, this being the Mail, Tony Blair and the \"arrogance of New Labour\" naturally get their warning bumps along the way. Nevertheless, Britain starts this election with the comforting assumption that, compared to the damned foreigners, our escutcheon is pretty blot free. Charges of sleaze will be thrown around - they usually are - but the body politic can cope. To which there are two vital responses. One involves a little thoughtfulness about the nature of corruption itself and the way the media pack chooses its targets. Mr Clinton, for instance, may have been an idiot over his 171 pardons, but none of the money involved is yet tied to him personally and he didn't invent the practice of dishing out free exit passes to the rich and powerful. His brother-in-law spent eight barren years while Hillary was in the White House not getting rich. The fascination of this business, for the moment, is observing the way that those who leave office (especially working-class boys from the wrong state and the wrong school) get shafted once they lose power. Those who inherit that power, meanwhile, seem to have very few questions asked. I was baffled in the States last year to understand why vice-president Cheney's pay-off from the big oil company he ran, and the stock options he continued to hold, didn't make it beyond page 327 of the New York Times. Thirty million dollars seemed a tidy sum. But Dick, like George W, was a coming man. Dick can now be made America's energy supremo, among other things, and nobody blinks. Perhaps they're right - or perhaps we shall only hear about it again much later. But the moving finger, to these eyes anyway, writes in a baffling scrawl. The other response, however, starts and stays much nearer to home. It is rooted in that fundamental assumption of relative cleanliness which still underpins the attitudes of our great and good leaders - best shown, a few years ago, when a supposedly investigating cabinet secretary chose to believe Jonathan Aitken's wholly mendacious account of events without even an ephemeral check - because the minister had given his word. We believe ourselves \"almost pristine\". We discern few tremors on our Richter scale. There is, in sum, a curious dislocation between experience and expectation. Take Robert Maxwell. He is history, a scoundrel 10 years in his grave: the amazingly delayed DTI report into his dealings seems to be history, too. Nobody in particular gets blamed and those who collect modest opprobrium are dead anyway. The ocean of assumption remains blissfully calm. Such things, in our benign mantra, can never happen again. Equally, when Mohamed Al Fayed blows the whistle on a bevy of corrupt MPs, the boomerang comes back with predictable complacency. Who doled out the cash for questions in the first place? Why, Mr Fayed: what a very unsuitable British citizen! Yet no one has the spunk to recall that we only knew about these dealings because Mr Fayed told us so in the first place. Another great old British tradition: abuse the whistleblower and make yourself feel better, cloak the past and the dead in benevolence. (Just compare the kindly obituaries of Sir Michael Grylls in the papers last week with Andrew Roth's lonely Guardian remembrance of the \"most senior and voracious MP run by the lobbyist Ian Greer\".) I don't set out here to play witchfinder general. On the contrary, a reverse assumption of chronic mistrust is neither sensible nor merited. But there are crucial things to keep in mind; and there are crucial defences which need sustaining. Do you, for instance, remember how the committee on standards and privileges published its report on the activities of the then Scottish secretary, John Reid, at the last gasp before Christmas, embarrassment buried in mistletoe and holly?

      "bodyText": "The full horror of the Northumberland farm believed to be the source of the foot and mouth outbreak began to emerge last night as the Ministry of Agriculture prepared for the mass incineration of hundreds of infected pigs in a field beside the Tyne Valley. Amid concern about welfare conditions at Burnside Farm, Heddon-on-the-Wall, after a string of complaints, ministry vets had served its operators with a special notice last December warning that conditions must be improved within a month, it was revealed. When they returned late in January, vets reported that conditions had improved, although they were still not adequate, a Maff spokesman told the Guardian. A further visit was planned this month but plans were overtaken by the foot and mouth outbreak. Some of those who had complained to local councils and animal welfare organisations, triggering the special inspections by the ministry and effectively setting alarm bells ringing, were adamant yesterday that Burnside was a disaster waiting to happen. But the ministry went out of its way to stress that, late in January, there were positively no traces of foot and mouth in pigs at the farm, which is effectively a fattening centre where animals are sent before a long journey to abattoirs in the south. Death came speedily to Burnside yesterday. Ministry experts and labourers built a giant pyre by carefully laying 250 railway sleepers across a 150ft long pit, and piling 75 tonnes of coal and two lorry-loads of straw on top. Eight hundred and fifty pigs and 35 cattle, covered with oil and diesel, were placed on the pyre in what amounted to a two-day long construction exercise. Cremations on this scale do not come quickly, or cheaply. Clad in bright yellow and red overalls, the workers had supervised mechanical excavators, tractors and dumper trucks carrying the remains of pigs from two farms at Heddon-on-the-Wall - Bobby and Ronald Waugh's holding at Burnside, with its 500 pigs, believed to be the original source, and Jimmy and Joan Brown's neighbouring unit at Heddon View, with 350 pigs and 35 cattle. After taking blood samples from the pigs, ministry vets spent two days \"humanely\" killing the animals with stun guns, carefully recording particulars from each beast. After slaughter, they soon discovered that the Heddon View pigs, initially condemned to death as a precaution, also had traces of foot and mouth - making the outbreak far bigger than initial estimates suggested. The Browns, who have been keeping pigs at Heddon View for 35 years, are reluctant to criticise their neighbours and have refused to join the chorus of disapproval against the Waugh brothers, who have insisted in a statement issued through the National Farmers' Union that it was not in their interest to have unhealthy pigs. But Mrs Brown told a local newspaper yesterday: \"It's just unfortunate they didn't farm the same way we farmed.\" With farmers in Northumberland fearful of the disease spreading - cattle at another farm beside Newcastle airport four miles away have already been condemned - the Ministry of Agriculture revealed last night that Burnside had been giving its officials cause for concern since last December. It was forced to take action after the RSPCA was refused access to Burnside following a complaint to the charity by the Norfolk-based Hillside animal sanctuary on December 18. The sanctuary said it had been told by a reliable Northumberland contact that rotting pig carcasses had been left alongside live pigs and that pieces of raw meat were left lying around the farm. The RSPCA complained to Northumberland county council trading standards department, which has animal welfare functions, and on December 22 ministry vets visited Burnside with county officials. A notice warning the Waughs to improve conditions was served, the ministry said. \"Conditions were described as rather dirty and not ideal,\" said a spokesman. By January 24, when a follow-up visit was made, conditions had improved, although the ministry said they were still not adequate. \"But the pigs at that time were said to be healthy and not in any way distressed,\" the spokesman said. A further visit was scheduled for a month later. After visiting the stricken area yesterday, Joyce Quin, the minister of state for agriculture, said that while they were always concerned about welfare matters, it would be wrong to pre-judge the outcome of any inquiry. Asked about locals raising fears about Burnside several months' ago, she said officials on January 24 saw no sign of disease at the farm. \"Obviously, welfare related problems are pursued also - sometimes by a slightly different avenue - but the responsibility of the department on that inspection was to see whether there was disease on the farm and at that point they did not find disease. \"But let me say a number of inquiries are being made as a result of the outbreak here and while I cannot prejudge the outcome of those I am very keen that the inquiry should be as thorough as possible. \"We believe we are taking every measure possible to contain the outbreak but a lot of tracing has to go on. \"There are trading links between various parts of the country and they have to be investigated.\" She said the department took welfare concerns very seriously and acted when there was enough evidence to prosecute.",

      "body": "<p>There hasn't been a new racecourse in Britain for donkey's years. Not, in fact, since the track at Taunton was laid out in 1927. There have been many new grandstands - Ascot, Newbury, Newmarket, Cheltenham among them - but because racecourses occupy so much land, and because we already have 59 of them stretching from Perth down to Newton Abbot, they have come low down on the scale of desirable new sporting venues. Especially, perhaps, now that interactive TV and the internet mean that those who like to bet on horses can do so from the comfort of their sofas. </p> <p>So, if you happened to want, as the Wiggins Group does, to encourage tens of thousands of people out to a new \u00a3100m racecourse, you would need to provide something pretty special. In May a month-long public enquiry will examine the proposed design by Foster and Partners for a brand new venue, the London City Racecourse, set in a new leisure park at Fairlop Water on green belt land in Essex. The land is owned by the London Borough of Redbridge; the Wiggins Group holds a 125-year lease on the site, where it runs a golf course with a lake for boating and fishing. </p> <p>The design, as you might expect from Foster, is special - seductive, space-age modern, a thing of great swooping wings and curves. It echoes the design of the same architects' magnificent Chep Lap Kok airport serving Hong Kong and, if approved, seems sure to bring racing a new audience. Not that racing isn't popular already. Each year five million people turn up at British racecourses primarily to bet, but also to enjoy a very particular day out. There is something special about the excitement generated by gleaming horses being ridden at full tilt by jockeys in colours that rival those of a medieval European battlefield. Many more people follow the horses on TV, of course, or curse and swear in a drunken haze in smoky high street bookies, yet these grim, addictive activities have little to do with the visceral pleasure of a day at the races. </p> <p>The rituals can be baffling. The byzantine betting system, the arcane semaphore of the tic-tac men, bets of \"ponies\" and \"monkeys\" rather than pounds, the comical dress of toffs and would-be toffs in the members' or club enclosures. Measures in furlongs (220 yards) and lengths (the distance between a horse's head and the base of its tail). The bizarre names of the horses themselves: Crepello, St Paddy, Shergar, Nijinsky, Prince Palatine. The hierarchical nature of it all, a parody of the old British class system - upper, middle and working - in the organisation and layout of public enclosures. </p> <p>From an architectural perspective, few racecourses in spire, although their settings can help. Goodwood - Glorious Goodwood - is set high on the Sussex Downs with views of the sea beyond. It boasts one of Britain's more modern grandstands, but this seems very old-fashioned when set against the bravura design of London City Racecourse. The plan is for this to be set in a new landscaped park, complete with a lake for sailing, a gym and health centre, covered children's play area, golf-driving range and paths for rambling. Although there will be plenty of parking, the course is close to London Underground Central Line stations at Fairlop and Barkingside. Despite the sailing and golfing, the heart of the development will be the racecourse and grandstand. </p> <p>Unlike most traditional racecourses, which have grown up bit by bit over many years, the grandstand's sightlines are focused on the finishing line; and it's there that the curved roof reaches its high point. The roof, designed like the wing of an aircraft, contains a glazed public walkway between its two skins that will offer views not just across the racecourse and its park, but right down the Lea Valley to the towers of Canary Wharf and the dome of St Paul's. The stables, also designed by Foster and following the same sinuous aesthetic as the grandstand, are on the far side of the finishing line across a natural amphitheatre, so racegoers can see the horses being led into the parade ring without having to leave their seats. </p> <p>The grandstand will be able to accommodate 10,000 spectators, all of them in direct contact with the track. The bars, restaurants and boxes gathered under the roof will all have windows that actually open - you'd be surprised just how many bars isolate spectators entirely from the events they are meant to have come to see. This is simply a reflection of the way in which buildings increasingly cut us off from the world outside; it's fine for an operating theatre, not much fun in an office, absurd at a cricket ground or racecourse. </p> <p>Although the design looks sensational - there are few racecourses as grand this side of Dubai - there is no guarantee that the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport will put it under starter's orders. Expert witnesses for Wiggins - trainer John Gosden; Paul Greeves, racing director of the British Horseracing Board; Tote chairman Peter Jones; and Brough Scott, journalist and Channel 4 racing presenter - will be up against local objectors, including environmental and residents' protest groups. Ron Jeffries, chairman of the local Aldborough Hatch Defence Association (Aldborough Hatch is a suburb of 8,000 residents directly south of the proposed site) has said that the new course will lead to crowding on the Tube and local roads and lower the quality of local life for both people and animals. He worries further, although there is no evidence for this, that Wiggins will want to use the site for other leisure activities such as pop concerts. No one particularly objects to development per se here, because although the site is designated green belt, it has been improved by the developers in recent years. Before it became a park and golf course, it was a waste dump and before that used for gravel extraction. Earlier still, it was an airfield used in both world wars. </p> <p>It's hard to say what the odds are for the project getting the go-ahead; a decision is likely to be made quickly after the public inquiry. But Oliver Iny, Wiggins's chief executive, is positive. \"It most definitely won't be used for pop concerts,\" he says. \"Weddings and Bar Mitzvahs maybe. The point is that this will be London's own racecourse and, as well as a great place to go, it will be connected to the rest of the world. We want it to compete with Dubai and Kentucky, to be the best.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Head Farm, the new Channel 4 comedy show pilot, has unexpectedly fallen victim to foot and mouth disease. The titles for the new show were to have featured comic Johnny Vegas being dragged along a field by a horse. But a planned shoot for the item has had to be put on hold as the government announces a ban on moving livestock, or entering farms. Head Farm is being touted as the big Friday night replacement for TFI Friday. It is written by This Morning with Richard Not Judy writer Stewart Lee. It will star a plethora of talent, including Vegas, Garth Marenghi and Jason Freeman from Sky One's Time Gentleman Please. Mr Lee said: \"Its difficult enough to make comedy programmes in the current climate of the cable revolution and cross-channel budget cuts without having the world of virus and microbes turn against you as well as the commissioning editors.\" The pilot is being recorded on March 20. Feb 23: Agency steps up food-safety publicity",

      "bodyText": "Brand consultancy Interbrand is working with the beleaguered Victoria &amp; Albert museum to help bring its image into the 21st century. The company behind Barclays Bank's \"big world\" rebranding campaign, which starred Anthony Hopkins, has been brought on board to help the V&amp;A ditch its \"stuffy\" and \"dusty\" image. The company has already produced a confidential report advising the V&amp;A on what it needs to do. The national audit office report revealed that visitor numbers had fallen by 200,000 last year. This makes the V&amp;A Britain's most expensive museum in terms of government subsidy per visitor. Last year, the V&amp;A hired Lowe Broadway to create its advertising. Up till now the agency has concentrated on campaigns for specific exhibitions. However, V&amp;A head of marketing Sarah Gray said the museum was likely to commission a generic branding campaign when the museum's new director Mark Jones arrives. \"We can't make any final decisions until he arrives, obviously, but I think it is likely that we will have a rebranding campaign,\" she said. \"We've been doing some preliminary work with Interbrand to help us with the brand and we will take it from there.\" The report attributed the museum's difficulties to poor marketing and an excessively highbrow image. Although the V&amp;A has tried to appeal to younger consumers - most recently with an exhibition called Brand.new that featured brands such as Levi's and Nike - it is still viewed as a \"dusty\" and \"stuffy\", according to the report. The V&amp;A has been relatively quiet in recent years, but it was once known for its aggressive marketing methods. In the early 1990s Saatchi &amp; Saatchi won awards for a poster for the V&amp;A that used the slogan, \"An ace caff with quite a nice museum attached\".",

In a play full of great scenes, possibly the finest is that in which Luther admits to Minnie that he has fathered a bastard child: Luther's guilt takes the form of an unreasoning anger while Minnie taunts him with being mollycoddled, \"marded\" and sexually inadequate. Strindberg never did anything finer in the exploration of marital tension.

On one level, Lawrence is writing about men's oedipal attachment to their mothers.

Alan Cox's Luther perfectly blends virility and weakness, Steven Elder is a hauntingly dreamy Joe and there is a peach of a performance from Jeanne Hepple who, as the \"werriting\" mother of the pregnant Bertha, might have stepped straight out of the pages of Dickens.

      "body": "<p>For most office workers, the concept of working through lunch is a way of life. Certainly that was the case at World Online, an internet service provider where desktop lunches were generally expected by the UK manager, Paul Kinsella. Until, that is, the company was bought by an Italian firm, whose chairman, Renato Soru, was horrified to see his new staff slaving away over their sandwiches. The difference in style was so great that Kinsella resigned over the issue - a move that was reported in several national papers last week. </p> <p>It might seem a storm in a teacup, but Soru's reaction to UK working conditions is an indication of the difference between our corporate world and that of our European neighbours. \"In Italy, offices simply shut down at lunchtime,\" says Nicholas Whitehead, who works for DTZ Debenham Thorpe in Milan. \"We are closed from 1pm to 2.30pm and although we have a rota so that there's always someone in the office, basically we go out and have a sit- down lunch.\" </p> <p>That includes the secretaries. Unlike in the UK where often the senior members of staff go out to lunch and leave support staff manning the phones, in Italy everyone takes their turn. \"The role of a secretary is very different in Italy,\" says Whitehead. \"For a start, we all do our own typing - including things like presentations. Instead of fast typing speeds and good knowledge of software packages, Italian secretaries are more likely to have skills such as accountancy and book-keeping. In many ways they're more like administrators than secretaries.\" </p> <p>In Italy the working day may be longer - most offices open at 9am and business doesn't close until 6.30pm - but the extended lunch makes the extra hours more palatable by breaking up the day and transforming the office atmosphere. \"Working here is far more sociable,\" believes Whitehead. \"If you sit and stare at your screen all day, as we do in the UK, you very rarely chat to your colleagues. If you have a long lunch with them each day, then it makes everyone a lot closer, and the office a nicer place to be.\" </p> <p>We may pride ourselves on the frequency of our teabreaks, but a lengthy afternoon break is common in southern European countries - in Madrid, for example, lunch can go on for hours. The catch is that the more relaxed atmosphere is balanced by a less impressive salary. In Italy, most secretaries earn little more than \u00a312,000, and in Spain, unless you are a top PA, you'll earn much the same. But there are other advantages to working abroad. </p> <p>\"Sun for a start,\" says Karen McIntosh, who is on secondment as a PA in Madrid. \"It sounds superficial, but it makes such a difference. But gradually you notice other differences; people treat secretarial staff very differently here - we are on a much more equal footing. Obviously for really senior managers we make coffee, pop out to get sandwiches - but with other people on the team there is far less hierarchy. We all go out for drinks together, for lunch - and everybody helps each other out when we're busy. In the UK, I used to get great stacks of files dumped on my desk and orders barked at me. No-one would dream of behaving like that here, they're all just too relaxed.\" </p> <p>According to McIntosh, office life is so much less stressful in Spain that she wants to extend her secondment. \"The only downside is holidays,\" she says. \"It's harder to take holidays when you want.\" Spain has many more bank holidays than Britain (a generous 14 a year), but everybody tends to take their leave in August because of a virtual nationwide shutdown which, claims McIntosh, can be a bit of a problem \"if you want to go off on a girlie holiday all together\". </p> <p>Judith Brooke, who worked in the South of France, found a similar situation. \"It's very hard not to take holiday in August because everything just shuts. So if you're looking for temp work it's impossible to find any agencies that are open - by the time September comes, and you would actually like to take a holiday, you can't because you're desperate to earn some money.\" </p> <p>Although getting work abroad might seem like a huge step, it can be quite simple. The main stipulation is the ability to speak another language. \"We have positions throughout Europe,\" says Sandra Dawson, who works for an international employment agency, \"but we won't consider anyone who isn't fluent in a second language.\" If you are, working in another country is simple. You can register at the UK branch for jobs abroad, or apply through agency websites that often post vacancies from their overseas branches. The fact is, however, that you are far more likely to find work in France or Germany than any of the more southerly European countries - their job markets simply aren't as buoyant. </p> <p>Germany may not sound as appealing as sunny Spain or Italy, but the rewards are greater; a good PA can start on as much as \u00a324k. But work starts early in Germany - usually about 8am - and employers tend to be far less flexible than in the UK and other parts of Europe. \"In Germany, education is centred around work - so you study for a particular vocation,\" says Judith Brooke. \"If you haven't got the right qualifications it can be hard to get work - the concept of taking someone on and training them up is not a concept that really exists in Germany.\" </p> <p>The other factor to consider is that in Germany, secretaries tend to stay secretaries, whereas attitudes in other European countries are far less restricted. \"I have been told that if I want to train to be a project manager that's not a problem,\" says McIntosh \"In the UK, you tend to be pigeonholed as a secretary; people don't like it if you try to cross over into a different role. Here, it's positively encouraged - if your boss thinks you do a good job, he or she will help you progress as far as you want to.\" </p> <p>In many ways, working abroad is less about salary or career progression and more about the chance to live in a different country and experience a different way of life. Secretarial work doesn't have to be restricted to offices; most holiday companies employ secretarial and admin staff to work in their larger resorts and often hotels may be happy to employ British PAs and administrative staff if they are fluent in a second language. </p> <p>It's not only the hot countries that offer a more relaxed alternative to UK office life. \"I really wanted to work abroad,\" says Jemma Warden, who works for a London consulting firm, \"and after waiting for months all they would offer me was Stavanger in Norway. So I took it - and had the most fantastic time. We started work at 7.30am but left the office at 4pm. In Norway no one lives far from the office and everyone eats early, so by 5.30pm I would have got home, changed, had dinner and be ready for the evening. I've never been so relaxed. I felt as if I spent the same amount of time at home as I did at work. The government has laid down laws to ensure that no one does too much overtime. There is a real emphasis on ensuring that everyone has enough time to spend with friends and family.\" </p> <p>For Warden, there really was only one downside to her overseas experience. \"It was a real shock to the system when I came back to the UK.\" </p> <p>For further info, visit <a href=\"http://www.adecco.co.uk\">www.adecco.co.uk</a> - apply online for jobs abroad</p>",

      "byline": "Tom Service",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Raymond Gubbay could not have chosen a better opera than Verdi's Aida for his latest Royal Albert Hall extravaganza. Verdi's glorious depiction of the decadence of the Egyptian Pharaohs represents 19th century opera at its most lavish and spectacular. Even Gubbay's controversial use of technology in his stagings (the soloists and orchestra are amplified throughout) has a parallel in the circumstances of Aida's commission: Verdi wrote the work in 1871 for the opening of a theatre in Cairo, built to celebrate the engineering miracle of the Suez Canal. </p> <p>In director David Freeman's production, the central area of the Albert Hall forms the stage, while the conductor, Peter Robinson, and the BBC Concert Orchestra are stationed behind the singers. The audience envelops the entire area. Not only does this arrangement present huge acoustic problems, it also distorts the audience's sightlines. </p> <p>But Freeman solves these problems with imagination and flair. The triumphant scene at the end of Act 2, as Radam\u00e8s celebrates victory over the Ethiopians, is a cinematic pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance. There are brilliantly choreographed fights, seductions and arcane rituals. The chorus and dancers, under the intense scrutiny of an unusually intimate audience, play their parts with conviction. Although it's impossible to keep your eyes on the drama between Radam\u00e8s and Aida in the midst of this melee, Freeman creates a complex chaos that would be impossible to replicate on a conventional operatic stage. </p> <p>But where the public side of the story is told convincingly, the central relationships are much less compellingly realised. The problems are not just to do with the quality of the individual singers, but also the effect of hearing them through amplification. Both Tamsin Dives's Aida and John Keyes's Radam\u00e8s sound strained by Verdi's high-octane vocal-writing, and Renata Skarelyte's performance of Amneris is full of effort but little reward. In this first of the three casts who will sing in Aida's two-week run, only Phillip Joll's Amonasro is strongly characterised. </p> <p>The love triangle between Aida, Radam\u00e8s and Amneris lacks intensity and passion. In the delicacy of the great duet in the final scene, the problems with the production's sound design are most apparent. Paradoxically, the attempt to bring the singers closer through amplification makes their voices sound disembodied and removed. It's like listening to a recording being played at enormous volume in the Albert Hall rather than watching a live performance. </p> <p>Whilst there's no doubting the success of the spectacle of Freeman and Gubbay's Aida, the production is dramatically rudderless. The arena of pharaohs, wars and triumphs is dislocated from the love between Radam\u00e8s and Aida. </p> <p> Until March 10. Box office: 020-7589 8212.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Raymond Gubbay could not have chosen a better opera than Verdi's Aida for his latest Royal Albert Hall extravaganza. Verdi's glorious depiction of the decadence of the Egyptian Pharaohs represents 19th century opera at its most lavish and spectacular. Even Gubbay's controversial use of technology in his stagings (the soloists and orchestra are amplified throughout) has a parallel in the circumstances of Aida's commission: Verdi wrote the work in 1871 for the opening of a theatre in Cairo, built to celebrate the engineering miracle of the Suez Canal. In director David Freeman's production, the central area of the Albert Hall forms the stage, while the conductor, Peter Robinson, and the BBC Concert Orchestra are stationed behind the singers. The audience envelops the entire area. Not only does this arrangement present huge acoustic problems, it also distorts the audience's sightlines. But Freeman solves these problems with imagination and flair. The triumphant scene at the end of Act 2, as Radam\u00e8s celebrates victory over the Ethiopians, is a cinematic pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance. There are brilliantly choreographed fights, seductions and arcane rituals. The chorus and dancers, under the intense scrutiny of an unusually intimate audience, play their parts with conviction. Although it's impossible to keep your eyes on the drama between Radam\u00e8s and Aida in the midst of this melee, Freeman creates a complex chaos that would be impossible to replicate on a conventional operatic stage. But where the public side of the story is told convincingly, the central relationships are much less compellingly realised. The problems are not just to do with the quality of the individual singers, but also the effect of hearing them through amplification. Both Tamsin Dives's Aida and John Keyes's Radam\u00e8s sound strained by Verdi's high-octane vocal-writing, and Renata Skarelyte's performance of Amneris is full of effort but little reward. In this first of the three casts who will sing in Aida's two-week run, only Phillip Joll's Amonasro is strongly characterised. The love triangle between Aida, Radam\u00e8s and Amneris lacks intensity and passion. In the delicacy of the great duet in the final scene, the problems with the production's sound design are most apparent. Paradoxically, the attempt to bring the singers closer through amplification makes their voices sound disembodied and removed. It's like listening to a recording being played at enormous volume in the Albert Hall rather than watching a live performance. Whilst there's no doubting the success of the spectacle of Freeman and Gubbay's Aida, the production is dramatically rudderless. The arena of pharaohs, wars and triumphs is dislocated from the love between Radam\u00e8s and Aida. Until March 10. Box office: 020-7589 8212.",
