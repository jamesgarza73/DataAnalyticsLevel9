      "body": "<p>Mutuality was dealt a nasty blow this week when Friends Provident, one of the UK's biggest life insurers, surprised everyone by announcing plans to convert to a plc and pay windfalls likely to run into thousands of pounds to policyholders. </p> <p>It was only a few days ago that the company came under attack from a group of carpetbaggers determined to force it to float on the stock market. However, Friends Prov says this is just a coincidence, and denies the speculators were responsible for its decision to ditch 168 years of mutuality. It says it came to the conclusion that mutuality was no longer the best way forward following several months of talks. </p> <p>The company, founded by Quakers in 1832, is one of the leading lights in the world of ethical investment. It is highly regarded as a personal pensions provider, but has come in for some stick over poor returns on some of its endowment policies. </p> <p>Applications for policies dated May 4 or later will not be eligible for windfalls. However, up until that date the company was still open to new members, with people able to buy a new Friends Provident savings plan for just \u00a335 a month, or a lump-sum investment bond for \u00a33,000. </p> <p><strong> Why is it demutualising?</strong> </p> <p>The company says that being a plc will give it \"greater financial flexibility\" and enable it to compete more effectively in today's marketplace. It claims that demutualisation should spell double good news for policyholders: they will receive shares in the company and are also likely to benefit from improved investment performance. </p> <p><strong> So how much am I going to get?</strong> </p> <p>Analysts suggest the company could float for around \u00a34bn-\u00a34.5bn. It had been assumed that only the 750,000 people holding \"with-profits\" policies - endowments, personal pensions and with-profits savings plans - would get windfalls, which would have meant average payouts of \u00a35,000-plus. </p> <p>But the company indicated this week it would also give around 1m non-with-profits policyholders payouts too, which means 1.7m people are set to benefit. If the money was dished out equally, that could mean windfalls averaging around \u00a32,300-\u00a32,700 per person. </p> <p>But this isn't going to happen. The company has pretty much confirmed that the with-profits people will get the lion's share of the windfall cake, with smaller payouts going to the the rest. It will probably take a similar approach to Norwich Union, which gave non-with-profits policyholders windfalls worth around \u00a3500 when it floated in 1997, while the with-profits people all got at least double this. </p> <p><strong> I'm a policyholder with London &amp; Manchester, the insurance company taken over by Friends Provident in 1998. Do I get a windfall?</strong> </p> <p>I'm afraid not. That's because London &amp; Manchester was a stock market quoted company when it was acquired by Friends Provident. </p> <p><strong> I'm a policyholder with UK Provident, a mutual insurer acquired by Friends Provident in the mid-80s.</strong> </p> <p>You're in luck. Provided you are a qualifying member (precise details of who is and who isn't will be announced later), you will get a windfall. </p> <p><strong> I've bought a second-hand Friends Provident endowment policy.</strong> </p> <p>Hmm, there doesn't seem to be a clear answer on this one. \"Someone who buys a [second-hand endowment] policy is not a member and will not benefit from compensation for loss of membership,\" said one senior official. However, another spokesman said he could not rule out these people getting some form of payout. Watch this space... </p> <p><strong> So what happens now?</strong> </p> <p>Friends Provident will be writing to policyholders next month to give more details of the proposed flotation. A special meeting to vote on the plans is likely around the middle of next year. At this, 75% of policyholders who vote must say yes to the company shedding its mutual status. If they say yes, flotation is set to take place \"before the end of 2001\". The earliest likely date is late summer/early autumn next year. </p>",

      "bodyText": "Mutuality was dealt a nasty blow this week when Friends Provident, one of the UK's biggest life insurers, surprised everyone by announcing plans to convert to a plc and pay windfalls likely to run into thousands of pounds to policyholders. It was only a few days ago that the company came under attack from a group of carpetbaggers determined to force it to float on the stock market. However, Friends Prov says this is just a coincidence, and denies the speculators were responsible for its decision to ditch 168 years of mutuality. It says it came to the conclusion that mutuality was no longer the best way forward following several months of talks. The company, founded by Quakers in 1832, is one of the leading lights in the world of ethical investment. It is highly regarded as a personal pensions provider, but has come in for some stick over poor returns on some of its endowment policies. Applications for policies dated May 4 or later will not be eligible for windfalls. However, up until that date the company was still open to new members, with people able to buy a new Friends Provident savings plan for just \u00a335 a month, or a lump-sum investment bond for \u00a33,000. Why is it demutualising? The company says that being a plc will give it \"greater financial flexibility\" and enable it to compete more effectively in today's marketplace. It claims that demutualisation should spell double good news for policyholders: they will receive shares in the company and are also likely to benefit from improved investment performance. So how much am I going to get? Analysts suggest the company could float for around \u00a34bn-\u00a34.5bn. It had been assumed that only the 750,000 people holding \"with-profits\" policies - endowments, personal pensions and with-profits savings plans - would get windfalls, which would have meant average payouts of \u00a35,000-plus. But the company indicated this week it would also give around 1m non-with-profits policyholders payouts too, which means 1.7m people are set to benefit. If the money was dished out equally, that could mean windfalls averaging around \u00a32,300-\u00a32,700 per person. But this isn't going to happen. The company has pretty much confirmed that the with-profits people will get the lion's share of the windfall cake, with smaller payouts going to the the rest. It will probably take a similar approach to Norwich Union, which gave non-with-profits policyholders windfalls worth around \u00a3500 when it floated in 1997, while the with-profits people all got at least double this. I'm a policyholder with London &amp; Manchester, the insurance company taken over by Friends Provident in 1998. Do I get a windfall? I'm afraid not. That's because London &amp; Manchester was a stock market quoted company when it was acquired by Friends Provident. I'm a policyholder with UK Provident, a mutual insurer acquired by Friends Provident in the mid-80s. You're in luck. Provided you are a qualifying member (precise details of who is and who isn't will be announced later), you will get a windfall. I've bought a second-hand Friends Provident endowment policy. Hmm, there doesn't seem to be a clear answer on this one. \"Someone who buys a [second-hand endowment] policy is not a member and will not benefit from compensation for loss of membership,\" said one senior official. However, another spokesman said he could not rule out these people getting some form of payout. Watch this space... So what happens now? Friends Provident will be writing to policyholders next month to give more details of the proposed flotation. A special meeting to vote on the plans is likely around the middle of next year. At this, 75% of policyholders who vote must say yes to the company shedding its mutual status. If they say yes, flotation is set to take place \"before the end of 2001\". The earliest likely date is late summer/early autumn next year.",

Engagement has its limitations, chief of which is the way you measure its success. Stephen Hine, head of research at the Ethical Investment Research Service expects more funds to get involved in shareholder engagement or at least claiming to do so. \"But if funds say they will use engagement they must prove that their approach is working. This will be more difficult and investors should be aware of this.\"",

      "byline": "Tim Ashley",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p><strong> Kirov Orchestra/Gergiev</strong> Royal Festival Hall, London **** <br> </p> <p>\"O hear the summons of the barbarian lyre,\" the Russian Symbolist Alexander Blok wrote in his 1918 poem The Scythians. The poem, with its queasy vision of Asiatic hordes terrorising Europe, was Blok's exultant response to the twin convulsions of war and revolution which had ripped apart the civilised veneer of the Tsarist empire. </p> <p>The \"barbarian lyre\" had, however, been sounding for a while: in 1916 Prokofiev premiered his Scythian Suite in Petrograd; as early as 1913, Stravinsky had self-consciously explored \"primitive\" Russia in The Rite of Spring. Both sonic cataclysms were commissioned by Diaghilev (though the ballet from which the Scythian Suite was derived never made it to the stage). It seemed appropriate that the two works should kick off the South Bank's massive Diaghilev retrospective, with the Kirov Orchestra conducted by Valery Gergiev. </p> <p>The Soviet authorities predictably gave The Rite of Spring a wide berth, so hearing it restored to the repertoire of one of Russia's finest orchestras was a treat. A couple of tentative brass entries apart, the playing was thrilling. Gergiev's interpretation is rivetting, though it has its flaws. This is no eruptive racket, but a carefully structured ritual proceeding with measured intensity. Part I is considerably more violent than Part II (it's usually the other way round). </p> <p>Gergiev finds vestiges of Russian Orthodox liturgy in the block chords and bell-like sonorities of the Summoning of the Ancestors. The voltage sometimes drops, however. Where Stravinsky calms down a bit, Gergiev dawdles, though he teases out some sensual textures in the process. The ending, with a colossal pause before the final crunch, is mannered in the extreme. </p> <p>The Scythian Suite has the reputation of being the loudest piece of music ever written, and there were certainly moments when you felt that the Festival Hall's roof might cave in.

      "bodyText": "Kirov Orchestra/Gergiev Royal Festival Hall, London **** \"O hear the summons of the barbarian lyre,\" the Russian Symbolist Alexander Blok wrote in his 1918 poem The Scythians. The poem, with its queasy vision of Asiatic hordes terrorising Europe, was Blok's exultant response to the twin convulsions of war and revolution which had ripped apart the civilised veneer of the Tsarist empire. The \"barbarian lyre\" had, however, been sounding for a while: in 1916 Prokofiev premiered his Scythian Suite in Petrograd; as early as 1913, Stravinsky had self-consciously explored \"primitive\" Russia in The Rite of Spring. Both sonic cataclysms were commissioned by Diaghilev (though the ballet from which the Scythian Suite was derived never made it to the stage). It seemed appropriate that the two works should kick off the South Bank's massive Diaghilev retrospective, with the Kirov Orchestra conducted by Valery Gergiev. The Soviet authorities predictably gave The Rite of Spring a wide berth, so hearing it restored to the repertoire of one of Russia's finest orchestras was a treat. A couple of tentative brass entries apart, the playing was thrilling. Gergiev's interpretation is rivetting, though it has its flaws. This is no eruptive racket, but a carefully structured ritual proceeding with measured intensity. Part I is considerably more violent than Part II (it's usually the other way round). Gergiev finds vestiges of Russian Orthodox liturgy in the block chords and bell-like sonorities of the Summoning of the Ancestors. The voltage sometimes drops, however. Where Stravinsky calms down a bit, Gergiev dawdles, though he teases out some sensual textures in the process. The ending, with a colossal pause before the final crunch, is mannered in the extreme. The Scythian Suite has the reputation of being the loudest piece of music ever written, and there were certainly moments when you felt that the Festival Hall's roof might cave in. It is in the quieter passages, like the nocturne, where Gergiev (and Prokofiev) are actually more impressive. The orchestration here is lush - closer to Strauss's Salome than anything by Stravinsky - and the sound glittered with opalescent beauty. Sandwiched in between this pair came Prokofiev's The Prodigal Son. Shorn of Balanchine's stupendous choreography, you become acutely aware that this is not so much a biblical parable as a portrait of the seductions and terrors of a very modernist city. You're also conscious, however, of the bitty, episodic nature of the music. The Prodigal Son may be one of Balanchine's greatest ballets, but it's not Prokofiev's best score.",

Savers are not told that the \"independently-selected\" unit trusts listed in discount ISA \"guides\" may have paid the broker anything up to \u00a3100,000 to gain inclusion. </p> <p>Critics say the guides, often included in newspaper sections or sent through the post, make a mockery of independent advice with one top IFA saying the practice \"stinks\". </p> <p>Nor is the public informed that some of the guides refuse to recommend funds which have not forked out, even though they may be the best choice for many investors. Other guides will list trusts which have not paid - but give them substantially less billing, reducing them to the equivalent of a bottom shelf brand in a supermarket. </p> <p>And while it is a \"pile them high, sell them cheap\" sales method - most of these brokers discount all of the 5% upfront charge - the range on offer is narrow. </p> <p>Unlike a supermarket which may have thousands of lines, \"discount brokers\" may offer as little as half a dozen funds. Last Sunday, Elson Associates, a Kent based IFA which calls itself 'one of the country's major investment discount houses' distributed millions of an Investing in Technology guide via a tabloid newspaper. </p> <p>Described as a \"complete\" ISA guide, it featured just five out of the 23 small investor technology funds currently on offer in the UK. Big names such as M&amp;G and SocGen Technology were excluded. The specific risk of investing in technology was relegated to small print while readers would be unaware of the recent fall in high tech shares which has knocked much of the gloss from performance, with some funds falling by 20% since their mid-March peak. Many of these guides are put together weeks before they are sent out.

      "bodyText": "Investors risk being misled by \"guides\" produced by independent financial adviser firms which offer neither independence nor advice, according to a Jobs &amp; Money investigation this week. Savers are not told that the \"independently-selected\" unit trusts listed in discount ISA \"guides\" may have paid the broker anything up to \u00a3100,000 to gain inclusion. Critics say the guides, often included in newspaper sections or sent through the post, make a mockery of independent advice with one top IFA saying the practice \"stinks\". Nor is the public informed that some of the guides refuse to recommend funds which have not forked out, even though they may be the best choice for many investors. Other guides will list trusts which have not paid - but give them substantially less billing, reducing them to the equivalent of a bottom shelf brand in a supermarket. And while it is a \"pile them high, sell them cheap\" sales method - most of these brokers discount all of the 5% upfront charge - the range on offer is narrow. Unlike a supermarket which may have thousands of lines, \"discount brokers\" may offer as little as half a dozen funds. Last Sunday, Elson Associates, a Kent based IFA which calls itself 'one of the country's major investment discount houses' distributed millions of an Investing in Technology guide via a tabloid newspaper. Described as a \"complete\" ISA guide, it featured just five out of the 23 small investor technology funds currently on offer in the UK. Big names such as M&amp;G and SocGen Technology were excluded. The specific risk of investing in technology was relegated to small print while readers would be unaware of the recent fall in high tech shares which has knocked much of the gloss from performance, with some funds falling by 20% since their mid-March peak. Many of these guides are put together weeks before they are sent out. Elson director Graham Elson was not available for comment. Brokers are legally obliged to disclose to you the commission paid to them by product providers. Indeed, the discount brokers' main selling point is that they pass back to you all or nearly all of the initial commission they receive. However, there are few rules preventing them from receiving income from product providers in other ways, such as payments for adverts that appear in the guides - provided the publishing operation does not make a profit, which would be banned under the FSA's indirect benefit rules.

      "body": "<p>Britain's booming house market is defying all attempts to keep it in check. Or it is slowing down following the exceptional surges in London and the south-east during the last year? These conflicting views were presented to millions of bemused homeowners and buyers this week by two of Britain's biggest mortgage lenders. </p> <p>According to the Nationwide, the price of an average house increased by \u00a31,500 last month - \u00a350 a day - to \u00a380,893. The typical UK property is now worth 17.5% more than a year ago - the highest figure for more than a decade, and a rate of growth almost seven times the 2.6% headline general rate of inflation. In some parts of London, prices are up as much as 45% in a year. The society says the current rate of house price growth is \"not sustainable\", then predicts that there will be no let-up in the strength of the market for another few months at least. </p> <p>By contrast, the Halifax reckons the market \"is not as buoyant as a few months ago\". It says prices rose last month, but by only 0.8%, compared with rises of well over 2% in December and January. It says the slowdown indicates that the four interest rate rises since the autumn are taking effect and reflects the fact that prices in many parts of London - the region that has led the upturn - have now breached the affordability ceiling for many would-be buyers. The price of a fairly average semi in a fairly average London borough is now \u00a3211,000. Based on standard mortgage criteria of three times income, you would need to be earning \u00a370,000 to afford such a property. </p> <p>Which lender is right? Well, the Nationwide's bullish view was backed by new figures showing that the amount of mortgage money lent by the major UK banks leapt by almost a third in March to \u00a36.5bn, compared with under \u00a35bn in February. There were 75,772 new loans approved for house purchase in March (this excludes remortgages, loans for home improvements and equity release schemes) - almost double January's total of 39,062. </p> <p>However, the Halifax makes the point that in London, property values have risen so far, so fast in some areas that growing numbers of would-be buyers are being priced out of the market, and are either turning their attentions to less expensive areas or are waiting for the market to calm down. </p> <p>This fits in with anecdotal evidence that ambitious sellers who put their homes on the market at sky-high prices, particularly in hot spot areas, are having to knock \u00a310,000, \u00a315,000 or even \u00a320,000 off the asking price. Privately, some valuers say the market in London has already turned. </p> <p>It's certainly fair to say that in London, the effects of the boom have trickled down into traditionally \"cheaper\" areas such as Newham and Lewisham to the extent that in terms of house price growth rates, they have now overtaken long standing star performers such as Islington and Kensington. </p> <p>Figures from the Nationwide show that last summer, the annual rate of house price inflation in Newham was 16%, while in Sutton, to the south, it was just 8%. Over in ultra-hip Islington, the figure was 20%, while in Kensington and Chelsea it was an impressive 25%. </p> <p>Fast-forward to the first three months of this year and the picture is very different: the annual house price growth figure for Newham has leapt to 31%, while in Sutton it has increased almost four-fold to 30%. However, Islington and Kensington and Chelsea have seen little or no acceleration: the figure for Islington is unchanged at 20%, and in Kensington and Chelsea it has only crept up slightly to 29%. </p> <p>A straw poll of estate agents in some of London's hot spots showed that many would rebut the suggestion that things are slowing down. In Islington there is evidence that the market may be cooling, but the view is that this probably reflects people rushing to complete their purchases before the stamp duty increase announced in the March Budget took effect. The borough's estate agents say demand continues to outstrip supply. </p> <p>Sellers in Fulham, south-west London, will be laughing all the way to the bank, with no one expecting prices to calm down and some agents saying increases of between 10% and 20% could still be possible this year. According to agents FPD Savills, prices in the area have increased 54.5% over the past year as buyers priced out of neighbouring Chelsea and Kensington looked to Fulham. </p> <p>Mukhtar Quraishi, managing director of agent Harrington Lowndes, says: \"Prices are still going up, though not as much as last year. People are more discerning now and are not willing to pay stupid prices.\" </p> <p>Clapham is showing signs of slowing down. Agents say demand is still strong, especially around the Common, but prices will probably start to stabilise over the year. Maggie McKenna of John D Wood says: \"Some buyers have been holding back, waiting to see what happens with interest rates and the stock market. They don't want to get burnt if prices start to fall.\" That said, entry level for flats is still over \u00a3100,000 and John D Wood recently sold a house in Clapham for \u00a33m. </p> <p>Signs are emerging that the price growth is rippling out to other regions. The region experiencing the biggest increase in house prices so far this year is the west Midlands, where the cost of the average home rose 5.1% to \u00a378,806 over January 1-March 31, according to the Halifax. </p> <p>Demand is not uniform throughout the area, with period family homes commanding a premium and modern terraces the lowest. And the possibility that the Rover car plant at Longbridge may close is putting people on edge. But Martin Greaves of Coventry estate agents Loveitts says: \"Longbridge has yet to have an impact on house prices as people are hoping the plant will be rescued. The market has been very hectic since the new year and at times has resembled the 1988 rush.\" </p> <p>The West Midlands average of \u00a378,806 may be light years away from the absurd London prices, but it's still way out of the league of many thousands of poorly-paid public sector workers. For them, the Halifax's table of typical prices for semi-detached houses in 59 UK counties and areas, will make depressing reading. According to its figures, a nurse earning \u00a314,800 a year, giving a mortgage of slightly over \u00a344,000, would struggle to get a mortgage to buy a semi in even the UK's very cheapest areas. The lowest prices in the Halifax table were South Humberside (\u00a345,700), South Yorkshire (\u00a348,000) and North Humberside (\u00a349,850). </p> <p>Growing numbers of people are finding themselves priced out of the rental market, too. The London Research Centre found that the average weekly rent for a two-bedroom flat in London was \u00a3274 - more than \u00a314,000 a year - and was as high as \u00a3399 in Westminster and \u00a3429 in Kensington and Chelsea. Yet the average rent for a similar property in Leeds was \u00a365 a week. It's estimated that Londoners earn about 12% more than people in the rest of the UK, but that clearly doesn't come anywhere close to bridging this vast north-south divide. </p> <p>It's worth pointing out that this is not the first time the Halifax and the Nationwide have clashed over house prices although both use similar methodologies. Something's clearly wrong somewhere, though, and it's a problem that needs prompt attention. </p> <p>The two lenders have a duty to ensure their house price indices accurately reflect what is happening on the streets of Britain. Their data influences the life-changing decisions people are making every day about whether they should buy or sell a property, and the Bank of England's interest rate decisions are guided to no small degree by their findings. </p> <p><strong>How a change of area can change your fortunes</strong> </p> <p>Mark Pavlika, 28, is an accountant earning \u00a336,000 a year - but all that could buy him is a one-bedroom flat, not even towards the centre of London. </p> <p>Instead, he bought a two-bedroom Victorian house in Edmonton in north London. He paid \u00a386,000 late last year and believes it has already risen in value to more than \u00a3100,000. But his house search took more than a year and a half. </p> <p>\"I wanted to move to the Bounds Green area because I grew up there and my family and friends still live there. </p> <p>\"But when I finally did look in Edmonton, I was amazed by the quality of the houses and how much I could get for my money. It's not the trendiest place in London, but the more first time buyers that move here, the better it will get.\" </p> <p>The prospect of a house price recession does not worry him as he is unlikely to move for the next 10 years. \"I've been living here since November and my house is already worth \u00a316,000 more than I paid for it, so from an investment point of view I'm very happy.\" </p>",

      "trailText": "<p>What does the planned merger of the London and Frankfurt stock exchanges mean for the small investor? Should we believe all the hype? Liz Stuart reports.</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p>Depending on who you listen to, this week's news that the London Stock Exchange is to merge with its Frankfurt counterpart is either a backdoor shove into the evil euro, or a great modernising leap forward which will streamline the whole sharetrading process along pan-European lines.</p> <p>The news prompted the predictable flood of xenophobic jokes on website investor bulletin boards (und now, fur somezing completely different... ) as well as some genuine concerns about the safety of investing in the plunging euro. But what does the merger really mean for the private investor? </p> <p><strong> Is it good news?</strong> </p> <p>It should lead to quick, efficient trading, says execution-only broker Charles Schwab. </p> <p>Stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown agrees: \"In the long term it should be a good thing. It will make it easier for the more sophisticated investor to buy foreign stocks like Deutsche Telekom cheaply. At the moment we don't offer our clients this service as it is just too expensive to be worthwhile,\" says a spokesman. </p> <p><strong> What about costs?</strong> </p> <p>As trading becomes more efficent, margins will narrow and brokerage costs will fall and this should be passed onto the consumer. </p> <p><strong> What about volatility? Will it make the stockmarket gyrate even more?</strong> </p> <p>The merged market will be much more liquid than the current LSE and pundits say that volatility levels should not be affected either way. </p> <p><strong> Is it going to increase demand for shares?</strong> </p> <p>The Association of Investment Trust Companies says that demand from Europe for cheap UK investment trusts may increase, which is good news for their shareholders. The extra demand should mean narrower discounts - so your shares will be worth more. </p> <p><strong> In future will share prices be quoted in euros?</strong> </p> <p>Here lies the big question. The new exchange, to be called iX, will not force any company to list in euros and many companies will chose not to do so. </p> <p>Building societies turned banks, for instance, have a very wide base of small shareholders in the UK and most of them will have little interest in listing in euros. But growing telecoms companies, for example, with plans for pan-European expansion, may prefer to list in euros rather than sterling. That will expose investors to a currency risk unless we join the single currency. </p> <p>Prices of UK companies listed in newspapers will continue to be given in sterling at least until the new organisation is operational. </p> <p><strong> What will this mean if I only invest through unit trusts or Isas?</strong> </p> <p>Collective investors will not see a big change, at least in the short term. Unit trusts will only convert to euro listing if their unit holders - that is, you - want to make the change. Even so, buying and selling in sterling will continue. </p> <p>Alternative Investment Market (AIM) shares will not be affected. </p> <p><strong> Is this the death of stamp duty on share purchases?</strong> </p> <p>Although news of the merger was widely leaked, many of the details have yet to be pinned down. </p> <p>The most important of these is stamp duty. In the UK we pay duty of 0.5% on share purchases, but in Germany deals are not taxed. </p> <p>Last year there were rumours that Gordon Brown was considering scrapping the duty, and this week's announcement will be another inducement to him. </p> <p><strong> Are other countries going to get involved?</strong> </p> <p>The new organisation, iX - which will be based partly in London and partly in Frankfurt - plans to forge a link with the US technology market Nasdaq. </p> <p>It is not yet clear just how this will work, but it should add to the number of shares available cheaply to UK investors. Exchanges in Milan and Madrid have already said they would like to get involved in iX. </p> <p><strong> What about trading hours? The Deutsche B\u00f6rse has different opening times from the LSE.</strong> </p> <p>Xetra, the computer system, or platform, on which the Frankfurt market trades, opens from 8.30am to 5pm German time, but from the beginning of June, trading will be extended into the evening until 8pm. It seems inevitable that the UK will move into line with this - and when the Nasdaq alliance happens, trading will operate round the clock. </p> <p><strong> Will this mean the end of the FTSE?</strong> </p> <p>What also seems inevitable is the eventual end of the FTSE 100. The exchanges have yet to hammer out which indices will be used, but there have already been moves towards a wider benchmark for share prices in both markets. </p> <p><strong> So when will all this happen?</strong> </p> <p>Nothing will happen just yet. As the Stock Exchange is keen to point out, the merger is \"an agreement at high level\" and, shareholder agreement pending, will not go through until the autumn. The effects will not be felt by most people for some time after that. </p> <p><strong> Does this mean no more days when you cannot trade because the stock exchange computer system has gone down?</strong> </p> <p>Everyone hopes so; the German exchange's technology will be used.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Depending on who you listen to, this week's news that the London Stock Exchange is to merge with its Frankfurt counterpart is either a backdoor shove into the evil euro, or a great modernising leap forward which will streamline the whole sharetrading process along pan-European lines. The news prompted the predictable flood of xenophobic jokes on website investor bulletin boards (und now, fur somezing completely different... ) as well as some genuine concerns about the safety of investing in the plunging euro. But what does the merger really mean for the private investor? Is it good news? It should lead to quick, efficient trading, says execution-only broker Charles Schwab. Stockbroker Hargreaves Lansdown agrees: \"In the long term it should be a good thing. It will make it easier for the more sophisticated investor to buy foreign stocks like Deutsche Telekom cheaply. At the moment we don't offer our clients this service as it is just too expensive to be worthwhile,\" says a spokesman. What about costs? As trading becomes more efficent, margins will narrow and brokerage costs will fall and this should be passed onto the consumer. What about volatility? Will it make the stockmarket gyrate even more? The merged market will be much more liquid than the current LSE and pundits say that volatility levels should not be affected either way. Is it going to increase demand for shares? The Association of Investment Trust Companies says that demand from Europe for cheap UK investment trusts may increase, which is good news for their shareholders. The extra demand should mean narrower discounts - so your shares will be worth more. In future will share prices be quoted in euros? Here lies the big question. The new exchange, to be called iX, will not force any company to list in euros and many companies will chose not to do so. Building societies turned banks, for instance, have a very wide base of small shareholders in the UK and most of them will have little interest in listing in euros. But growing telecoms companies, for example, with plans for pan-European expansion, may prefer to list in euros rather than sterling. That will expose investors to a currency risk unless we join the single currency. Prices of UK companies listed in newspapers will continue to be given in sterling at least until the new organisation is operational. What will this mean if I only invest through unit trusts or Isas? Collective investors will not see a big change, at least in the short term. Unit trusts will only convert to euro listing if their unit holders - that is, you - want to make the change. Even so, buying and selling in sterling will continue. Alternative Investment Market (AIM) shares will not be affected. Is this the death of stamp duty on share purchases? Although news of the merger was widely leaked, many of the details have yet to be pinned down. The most important of these is stamp duty. In the UK we pay duty of 0.5% on share purchases, but in Germany deals are not taxed. Last year there were rumours that Gordon Brown was considering scrapping the duty, and this week's announcement will be another inducement to him. Are other countries going to get involved? The new organisation, iX - which will be based partly in London and partly in Frankfurt - plans to forge a link with the US technology market Nasdaq. It is not yet clear just how this will work, but it should add to the number of shares available cheaply to UK investors. Exchanges in Milan and Madrid have already said they would like to get involved in iX. What about trading hours? The Deutsche B\u00f6rse has different opening times from the LSE. Xetra, the computer system, or platform, on which the Frankfurt market trades, opens from 8.30am to 5pm German time, but from the beginning of June, trading will be extended into the evening until 8pm. It seems inevitable that the UK will move into line with this - and when the Nasdaq alliance happens, trading will operate round the clock. Will this mean the end of the FTSE? What also seems inevitable is the eventual end of the FTSE 100. The exchanges have yet to hammer out which indices will be used, but there have already been moves towards a wider benchmark for share prices in both markets. So when will all this happen? Nothing will happen just yet. As the Stock Exchange is keen to point out, the merger is \"an agreement at high level\" and, shareholder agreement pending, will not go through until the autumn. The effects will not be felt by most people for some time after that. Does this mean no more days when you cannot trade because the stock exchange computer system has gone down? Everyone hopes so; the German exchange's technology will be used.",

He also bowled a wide and a full toss that was slogged through midwicket for four by Rob Turner. </p> <p>This was hardly Warne's most memorable day because his solitary wicket should not have been given by umpire Roy Palmer, who adjudged Piran Holloway caught behind by Derek Kenway. Holloway looked bemused and local TV pictures later confirmed that the batsman did not get a touch. </p> <p>The conditions did not favour Warne. The chilly wind numbed his fingers and the flat pitch offered him little bounce or turn, although he might have attempted a little more variety. </p> <p>Hampshire followers must be thoroughly fed up with Cox. In their final home match of last season they watched the Somerset captain score 216 and 129 not out. His 153 yesterday gave him a three-innings total of 498 and an average of 249. </p> <p>Yesterday he played Warne expertly, concentrating on a forward defensive of exagger ated care before rocking quickly on to the back foot to cut anything short. He batted for some 6 hours and put on 119 in 45 overs with the English-born, Australian-raised Bowler and then 131 in 37 with Turner, both partners scoring 56. </p> <p>When Simon Renshaw took the new ball he struck three times as Somerset lost their last five wickets for 36 runs. Their total of 319 still gave them a first-innings lead of 87. But they needed all of that because Matt Bulbeck (back) and Steffan Jones (hamstring) may not be able to bowl today.</p>",

Yesterday he finished with the rather unflattering figures of 33-10-83-1. He also bowled a wide and a full toss that was slogged through midwicket for four by Rob Turner. This was hardly Warne's most memorable day because his solitary wicket should not have been given by umpire Roy Palmer, who adjudged Piran Holloway caught behind by Derek Kenway. Holloway looked bemused and local TV pictures later confirmed that the batsman did not get a touch. The conditions did not favour Warne. The chilly wind numbed his fingers and the flat pitch offered him little bounce or turn, although he might have attempted a little more variety. Hampshire followers must be thoroughly fed up with Cox. In their final home match of last season they watched the Somerset captain score 216 and 129 not out. His 153 yesterday gave him a three-innings total of 498 and an average of 249. Yesterday he played Warne expertly, concentrating on a forward defensive of exagger ated care before rocking quickly on to the back foot to cut anything short. He batted for some 6 hours and put on 119 in 45 overs with the English-born, Australian-raised Bowler and then 131 in 37 with Turner, both partners scoring 56. When Simon Renshaw took the new ball he struck three times as Somerset lost their last five wickets for 36 runs. Their total of 319 still gave them a first-innings lead of 87. But they needed all of that because Matt Bulbeck (back) and Steffan Jones (hamstring) may not be able to bowl today.",

Lord Stevenson, 54, a crossbench peer with Labour connections, was picked after an open recruitment process conducted by the accountants, PWC.</p> <p>His eminence did not stop Tory peers and MPs complaining that the new panel is a \"smokescreen\" which will still allow Mr Blair to decide the balance between parties, the total size of the Lords and to appoint the people who will help Lord Stevenson do the appointing - pending further reform of the upper house.</p> <p>Over the years Lord Stevenson has employed both Peter Mandelson and his aide, Benjamin Wegg-Prosser. Andrew Tyrie, the Tory MP for Chichester, said: \"Lord Stevenson is too close to the Blair presidency for comfort.\"</p> <p>To square the gender and regional pressures to make the Lords more represenative of Britain, the independent members chosen yesterday were Angela Sarkis, chief executive of the Church Urban Fund; Dame Deirdre Hine, previously chief medical officer at the Welsh Office and chairman of the NHS's new commission for health improvement; and Ms Felicity Huston. She is chairman of the Northern Ireland consumer committee for electricity and deputy chairman of the General Consumer Council of Northern Ireland. Both William Hague and Charles Kennedy were said to be \"content\" with the appointments.</p> <p>The newcomers will join the three party political members of the existing vetting panel: Lord Hurd, the ex-foreign secretary, Lady Dean, the former TUC stalwart; and the Lib Dem peer, Lord Dholakia.</p> <p>With their \"diverse range of personal backgrounds, they will be well qualified to take forward the process of appointing non-political peers to the House of Lords on a more open and transparent basis and to take on responsibility for vetting all nominations for peerages\", Mr Blair said.</p> <p>But the Tory leader in the Lords, Lord Strathclyde, replied in a statement: \"Everyone apart from Tony Blair recognises the need to rein in patronage. This new appointments commission is not the answer. It is nothing more than a smokescreen behind which he can continue to wield the key powers of patronage.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "Tony Blair chose local election day, when most politicians and the media were focused on last minute manoeuvres among candidates, to reveal his plans to rebut charges that his half-reformed House of Lords will be packed with \"Tony's cronies\". Lord Stevenson of Coddenham - chairman of the Pearson publishing giant and the Halifax plc and a veteran of many official quangos - will also chair the interim House of Lords appointment commis sion. Lord Stevenson, 54, a crossbench peer with Labour connections, was picked after an open recruitment process conducted by the accountants, PWC. His eminence did not stop Tory peers and MPs complaining that the new panel is a \"smokescreen\" which will still allow Mr Blair to decide the balance between parties, the total size of the Lords and to appoint the people who will help Lord Stevenson do the appointing - pending further reform of the upper house. Over the years Lord Stevenson has employed both Peter Mandelson and his aide, Benjamin Wegg-Prosser. Andrew Tyrie, the Tory MP for Chichester, said: \"Lord Stevenson is too close to the Blair presidency for comfort.\" To square the gender and regional pressures to make the Lords more represenative of Britain, the independent members chosen yesterday were Angela Sarkis, chief executive of the Church Urban Fund; Dame Deirdre Hine, previously chief medical officer at the Welsh Office and chairman of the NHS's new commission for health improvement; and Ms Felicity Huston. She is chairman of the Northern Ireland consumer committee for electricity and deputy chairman of the General Consumer Council of Northern Ireland. Both William Hague and Charles Kennedy were said to be \"content\" with the appointments. The newcomers will join the three party political members of the existing vetting panel: Lord Hurd, the ex-foreign secretary, Lady Dean, the former TUC stalwart; and the Lib Dem peer, Lord Dholakia. With their \"diverse range of personal backgrounds, they will be well qualified to take forward the process of appointing non-political peers to the House of Lords on a more open and transparent basis and to take on responsibility for vetting all nominations for peerages\", Mr Blair said. But the Tory leader in the Lords, Lord Strathclyde, replied in a statement: \"Everyone apart from Tony Blair recognises the need to rein in patronage. This new appointments commission is not the answer. It is nothing more than a smokescreen behind which he can continue to wield the key powers of patronage.\"",

It was a bad year for Conservatives, who lost Rochdale to Labour, coming third. </p> <p><b>1962</b><br> Liberal Eric Lubbock, now Lord Avebury, took Orpington off the Tories on a 26.8% swing. </p> <p><b>1966</b><br> Gwynfor Evans gave Plaid Cymru its first seat when he took Carmarthen from Labour on an 18% swing. </p> <p><b>1967</b><br> Mrs Winifred Ewing snatched a seat for the Scottish National Party, when she turned a 16,576 Labour majority at Hamilton into a 1,799 nationalist one. She polled 46% in a constituency previously uncontested by her party. </p> <p><b>1968</b><br> Tories chalked up a 21.1 % swing to take Dudley from Labour. </p> <p><b>1969</b><br> Liberals captured Ladywood, their first Birmingham seat for 83 years, from Labour on a 32% swing. The two years from November 2 1967 to Oct 30 1969 brought Labour its worst by-election run. The party lost 10 seats during that time and the swing against it was never less than 10%. </p> <p><b>1972</b><br> Liberals overturned a 12,696 Conservative majority to win Sutton and Cheam on a 32.6% swing. </p> <p><b>1973</b><br> Dick Taverne won Lincoln for the Democratic Labour party, standing against the official Labour candidate and polling 58.2%. At Ripon Liberal David Austick gained the seat on a 25.3% swing while Clement Freud polled 38.3% to win the Isle of Ely for the party - which had not fought the constituency in the 1970 general election. The SNP's Margo MacDonald gained Glasgow Govan from Labour on a 26.7% swing. </p> <p><b>1976</b><br> Tories gained Walsall North on a 22.5% swing after the imprisonment of the Labour MP, former minister John Stonehouse. </p> <p><b>1977</b><br>The Conservatives toppled Labour in its Ashfield mining stronghold on a 20.8% swing. </p> <p><b>1979</b><br> David Alton turned a Labour majority of 6,171 in Liverpool Edge Hill into a Liberal lead of 8,133, achieving a 32.4% swing. </p> <p><b>1981</b><br>Shirley Williams, a Social Democratic Party founder member, won Crosby from Tories on a 25.5% swing for the Liberal/SDP Alliance. Liberal Bill Pitt ousted Tories at Croydon North West on a 24.2% swing. </p> <p><b>1982</b><br> But in the last days of the Falklandas War it was Tories' turn to win when they took Mitcham and Morden off former Labour MP Bruce Douglas-Mann who had defected to the SDP, resigned his seat and stood again, pushing Labour into third place. There was a net 10.6% swing from Labour to Tories on what was the last occasion the Government party gained an Opposition seat at a by-election. </p> <p><b>1983</b><br> Liberal Simon Hughes gained the highest swing since the war - 44.2% - when he won Bermondsey from Labour. </p> <p><b>1988</b><br> Jim Sillars grabbed Glasgow Govan for the SNP on a 33.1% swing from Labour, emulating the victory in the same area of his wife Margo MacDonald 14 years before. </p> <p><b>1989</b><br> Labour's John Smith took the Vale of Glamorgan from the Tories on a 12.4% switch - giving the party its most dramatic by-election win for more than half a century. </p> <p><b>1990</b><br> The \"safe\" Conservative seat of Mid-Staffordshire was won by Labour with a 21.33% swing. Liberal Democrats ended a run of disappointing performances when they captured Eastbourne from the Tories on a 20% switch. </p> <p><b>1991</b><br> Liberal Democrats captured Ribble Valley, among the top 15 Tory strongholds, by notching up a 24.7% swing after a campaign dominated by the poll tax. Labour also triumphed two months later winning Monmouth from the Tories on a 12.6% move. Key issue here was the National Health Service. </p> <p><b>1993</b><br> The first by-election of the new parliament saw Liberal Democrats capture Newbury from Tories with 22,055 majority on a 28.4% swing. This was followed by the Christchurch contest which brought the biggest recorded swing against a Government - 35.4% from Conservative to Liberal Democrats. </p> <p><b>1994</b><br>Tories were forced into third place at Eastleigh, where they were defending a 17,702 majority.

      "bodyText": "1935 Labour won Liverpool Wavertree on a 30% swing following intervention of Randolph Churchill as an Independent Conservative. 1958 Mark Bonham-Carter gave the Liberals their first by-election gain since 1929 when he won Torrington, Devon, from Tories with a 219 majority. It was a bad year for Conservatives, who lost Rochdale to Labour, coming third. 1962 Liberal Eric Lubbock, now Lord Avebury, took Orpington off the Tories on a 26.8% swing. 1966 Gwynfor Evans gave Plaid Cymru its first seat when he took Carmarthen from Labour on an 18% swing. 1967 Mrs Winifred Ewing snatched a seat for the Scottish National Party, when she turned a 16,576 Labour majority at Hamilton into a 1,799 nationalist one. She polled 46% in a constituency previously uncontested by her party. 1968 Tories chalked up a 21.1 % swing to take Dudley from Labour. 1969 Liberals captured Ladywood, their first Birmingham seat for 83 years, from Labour on a 32% swing. The two years from November 2 1967 to Oct 30 1969 brought Labour its worst by-election run. The party lost 10 seats during that time and the swing against it was never less than 10%. 1972 Liberals overturned a 12,696 Conservative majority to win Sutton and Cheam on a 32.6% swing. 1973 Dick Taverne won Lincoln for the Democratic Labour party, standing against the official Labour candidate and polling 58.2%. At Ripon Liberal David Austick gained the seat on a 25.3% swing while Clement Freud polled 38.3% to win the Isle of Ely for the party - which had not fought the constituency in the 1970 general election. The SNP's Margo MacDonald gained Glasgow Govan from Labour on a 26.7% swing. 1976 Tories gained Walsall North on a 22.5% swing after the imprisonment of the Labour MP, former minister John Stonehouse. 1977 The Conservatives toppled Labour in its Ashfield mining stronghold on a 20.8% swing. 1979 David Alton turned a Labour majority of 6,171 in Liverpool Edge Hill into a Liberal lead of 8,133, achieving a 32.4% swing. 1981 Shirley Williams, a Social Democratic Party founder member, won Crosby from Tories on a 25.5% swing for the Liberal/SDP Alliance. Liberal Bill Pitt ousted Tories at Croydon North West on a 24.2% swing. 1982 But in the last days of the Falklandas War it was Tories' turn to win when they took Mitcham and Morden off former Labour MP Bruce Douglas-Mann who had defected to the SDP, resigned his seat and stood again, pushing Labour into third place. There was a net 10.6% swing from Labour to Tories on what was the last occasion the Government party gained an Opposition seat at a by-election. 1983 Liberal Simon Hughes gained the highest swing since the war - 44.2% - when he won Bermondsey from Labour. 1988 Jim Sillars grabbed Glasgow Govan for the SNP on a 33.1% swing from Labour, emulating the victory in the same area of his wife Margo MacDonald 14 years before. 1989 Labour's John Smith took the Vale of Glamorgan from the Tories on a 12.4% switch - giving the party its most dramatic by-election win for more than half a century. 1990 The \"safe\" Conservative seat of Mid-Staffordshire was won by Labour with a 21.33% swing. Liberal Democrats ended a run of disappointing performances when they captured Eastbourne from the Tories on a 20% switch. 1991 Liberal Democrats captured Ribble Valley, among the top 15 Tory strongholds, by notching up a 24.7% swing after a campaign dominated by the poll tax. Labour also triumphed two months later winning Monmouth from the Tories on a 12.6% move. Key issue here was the National Health Service. 1993 The first by-election of the new parliament saw Liberal Democrats capture Newbury from Tories with 22,055 majority on a 28.4% swing. This was followed by the Christchurch contest which brought the biggest recorded swing against a Government - 35.4% from Conservative to Liberal Democrats. 1994 Tories were forced into third place at Eastleigh, where they were defending a 17,702 majority. Liberal Democrats gained the seat on a 21.4% swing with a 9,239 majority over Labour. The year ended with Labour scoring its biggest swing for nearly half a century, 29.1%, to take Dudley West from Tories. 1995 Conservatives were forced into third place by Labour as the SNP took Perth and Kinross off them on an 11.5% swing. Just over a month later they also tumbled to third position as Liberal Democrats took Littleborough and Saddleworth off them on an 11.6% swing. 1996 Tories went down to Labour in another landslide at Staffordshire South East where the votes movement was 22.2%. 1997 With the General Election less than two months away, Conservatives lost to Labour at Wirral South on a 17.2% swing. Tories failed to win a single by-election between William Hague's victory at Richmond, Yorks in 1989 and their win in their first contest of the new 1997 Parliament at Uxbridge. But this success was short-lived when Liberal Democrat Mark Oaten won the Winchester poll, a re-run after the general election result was declared void, with a 21,556 majority on a 19.8% swing.",

      "body": "<p>The proposition is strangely surreal. Ken Livingstone's election as London Mayor is being presented as a \"blow to Labour and a blow to Tony Blair\".</p> <p>In essentially Labour voting London, the electorate has abandoned the official candidate, Frank Dobson and plumped instead for the seriously unofficial, and serial off-message candidate. The winner - Ken Livingstone - would have been the official Labour candidate had Tony Blair sanctioned a fair internal ballot of members. Had he done so, the government's mid-term blues might have been banished this morning.</p> <p>The import of a hybrid system of directly-elected mayors from the United States may have failed in its first objective - to raise the game of local politicians and blow away public apathy.</p> <p>Yet it has succeeded, beyond all expectations, in further elevating personality over policy. What Labour party supporters cannot understand is why two personalities in particular - Blair and Livingstone - could not find some way of accommodating each other. The onus is now on the prime minister to do just that.</p> <p>He could yet give Labour a second chance in the capital.

      "bodyText": "The proposition is strangely surreal. Ken Livingstone's election as London Mayor is being presented as a \"blow to Labour and a blow to Tony Blair\". In essentially Labour voting London, the electorate has abandoned the official candidate, Frank Dobson and plumped instead for the seriously unofficial, and serial off-message candidate. The winner - Ken Livingstone - would have been the official Labour candidate had Tony Blair sanctioned a fair internal ballot of members. Had he done so, the government's mid-term blues might have been banished this morning. The import of a hybrid system of directly-elected mayors from the United States may have failed in its first objective - to raise the game of local politicians and blow away public apathy. Yet it has succeeded, beyond all expectations, in further elevating personality over policy. What Labour party supporters cannot understand is why two personalities in particular - Blair and Livingstone - could not find some way of accommodating each other. The onus is now on the prime minister to do just that. He could yet give Labour a second chance in the capital. Certainly he should obey his instincts and not continue a pointless feud for which he has already been punished. Ken Livingstone should be readmitted into the Labour Party. Despite the fact that there were, in effect, two Labour candidates for mayor, it is the prime minister's good fortune to wake up this morning and discover that Steven Norris has not been elected mayor. It is also a mark of just how divorced the national press is from its metropolitan readers that its near uniform hostility to Ken Livingstone had such little impact on their voting intention. The London Labour party, and the many thousands who cast their votes for Livingstone hope and expect that he is admitted back into the party at the earliest opportunity.

There will be renewed pressure, too, to ensure that the party leadership never repeats horrendous own goals, first in Wales, now in London, by ensuring that one member, one vote is always used for internal elections. It is now obvious that Jim Fitzpatrick, the current chairman of the London Labour party, who helped engineer the original electoral college fix against Livingstone, is in an untenable position. He should resign in order to allow the London Labour party to elect a chairman who will respect their democratic rights. Elsewhere in the country, a distinctly patchy night for the government led to a premature Tory triumphalism, that still seems unlikely to much boost William Hague's chances at the next election.

I started off in Evans and tried four pairs in various lengths and fits. Unfortunately none was quite long enough or they were baggy around the hips - obviously made for a more rounded person! </p> <p>Next stop was Principles, where I tried two pairs of jeans, without luck, then leafed through the shelves of well-known brands to attempt to find a larger size. I did try one pair of black Levi's 501s - again I found they weren't the right cut for me, so I thought I'd just take a glance at the men's department and picked up a pair of Calvin Kleins and Levi's 501s. The young lad in attendance looked a bit astounded when I asked to try them on, but graciously allowed me to use the fitting room, even though I offered to go across to the ladies' department. Success at last: the 501s came up tops and I even have a little bit of extra length if I want to wear heels or they shrink a bit. </p> <p>I was still embarrassed, though, at buying men's jeans. In future, to spare my blushes, I'll go back to ordering from my home shopping catalogue where I can try them on in the comfort of my own home. </p> <p><strong>Bonnie Gilmore, 23, video operator</strong>Since most British women fall below 5ft 4in, you'd think it would be easy to find a pair of jeans for someone size six and 5ft 1in. Think again, girlfriend. Ten lunchtimes and as many shops as you can name, my quest for a new pair of jeans was failing miserably. </p> <p>Forgetting about length because that's always an issue, I concentrate on the fit around waist, hips and crotch. Once upon a time, urban streetwear suited me perfectly: baggy, baggy, baggy. But after one night in Earl jeans (my favourite Christmas present yet), baggy Carhartts lost their appeal. So here I was, back in the land of straight jeans but unable to find a suitable high street pair that fitted. You name it, I tried it - and ended up with old man's baggy crotch or big saggy bum. </p> <p>With Gap, French Connection and Diesel having failed me, all roads led to Levi's. Seduced by the ad campaign, \"twisted jeans\" were my first choice, but I was disappointed again - and in another pair of grandad's trousers. The helpful assistant suggested I try on six different styles. The winner was the classic dark denim 501s, style 535. These fulfilled every criteria: fitting well at waist, hips and crotch, straight-legged, slim-fitted and versatile. Suitable for work or Sunday football, fine with trainers and high-heeled boots. </p> <p><strong>John Beament, 50, managing director</strong></p> <p>My mission to buy a pair of jeans started at a well-known department store in Knightsbridge. As I was browsing, I came across a pair of designer jeans which, at \u00a365, seemed a good buy, until I looked in the mirror and realised I was 30 years too old for them and they had 10 pockets too many for me. </p> <p>Next stop was Gap where I tried on two pairs, both priced at a reasonable \u00a342. The first pair, Boot Fit, were too tight, the second, Vintage Cut, too baggy. The designer had got it wrong for the shape of my body. </p> <p>From Gap I went to Harringtons and picked pairs of Gant and Paul Smith denims, both priced at \u00a369. Though both were good quality, they looked better on the shelf than they did on me. At this point, I was seriously considering resorting to a pair of the Levi's 501s I have always bought in the past, but I decided my last visit would be to Ikon in Guildford where I tried on several Armani and Boss jeans. The Boss Arkansas dark blue denims were just what I wanted and I went home happy, having spent \u00a370 on a pair of jeans I really like.</p> <p><strong>Ritchie Parrott, 31, admin assistant</strong></p> <p>It's a clich\u00e9 that gay men love to go clothes shopping: as a fat gay man, I can honestly say I don't. For me, the dreaded event happens only when my clothes have buttons dropping off and holes where there shouldn't be holes. Finding something that fits is not always easy, but I'm on a mission: to find jeans for summer that can be worn at work or play. </p> <p>My options are limited, but I'm hopeful. I check a couple of high street chain stores and M&amp;S - no luck. Then on to the fat man's shopping mecca, High and Mighty in London's Tottenham Court Road. They're quite trendy, a little bit pricey, but worth it for the joy of knowing you are going to get what you need. The staff were quick to assist, even when measuring my ever neglected waistline. When the jeans I liked weren't available in my size, they offered - without any fuss - to phone another branch, which was a nice touch. </p> <p>The jeans ranged from Pierre Cardin at \u00a3119 to the affordable Easy range at around \u00a349. I chose a pair of beige carpenter jeans that fell into the latter category. Job done and dusted within the hour - perhaps it's not as hard I thought. And if you want to make it even easier, shop from home at <a href=\"http://www.highandmighty.co.uk\" target=\"_NEW\">www.highandmighty.co.uk</a></p> <p><strong>Lyndsay Austin, 42, solicitor</strong></p> <p>I've worn jeans since my 70s student days when denims other than Levi's attracted howls of derision. A long leg is a must and I prefer a tightish fit but not breathing isn't an option. I began my quest at Allders in Woking. Nostalgia cooled after a pathetic struggle to fasten Wrangler's \"70s cut\" button flares. On to Next, where the stretch Classics protruded strangely around my knees. At TK Max (the designer seconds store), the Pepe Nicole jeans were too short and balloon-like. Elbowing aside the male shoppers, I tried a pair of men's DKNY long blue zip denims (past season). Slightly low-rise, they fastened after a satisfyingly brief struggle. The length was excellent, the fit snug but not life-threatening. Best so far. </p> <p>My street cred improving, I hit Levi's and tried their Engineered Jeans. The fit was fantastic but (call me old-fashioned) I like my side seams at the sides, though the customised embroidery option was fun. The low-rise Gap Boy Fits, meanwhile, were too short and pleated around the derriere, and at Betty Barclay, the only jeans within budget were stretchy and comfortable but girlie and high-waisted. So it was back to TK Max for my almost perfect men's DKNY jeans - a bargain at \u00a324.99.</p>",

For me, the dreaded event happens only when my clothes have buttons dropping off and holes where there shouldn't be holes. Finding something that fits is not always easy, but I'm on a mission: to find jeans for summer that can be worn at work or play. My options are limited, but I'm hopeful. I check a couple of high street chain stores and M&amp;S - no luck. Then on to the fat man's shopping mecca, High and Mighty in London's Tottenham Court Road. They're quite trendy, a little bit pricey, but worth it for the joy of knowing you are going to get what you need. The staff were quick to assist, even when measuring my ever neglected waistline. When the jeans I liked weren't available in my size, they offered - without any fuss - to phone another branch, which was a nice touch. The jeans ranged from Pierre Cardin at \u00a3119 to the affordable Easy range at around \u00a349. I chose a pair of beige carpenter jeans that fell into the latter category. Job done and dusted within the hour - perhaps it's not as hard I thought. And if you want to make it even easier, shop from home at www.highandmighty.co.uk Lyndsay Austin, 42, solicitor I've worn jeans since my 70s student days when denims other than Levi's attracted howls of derision. A long leg is a must and I prefer a tightish fit but not breathing isn't an option. I began my quest at Allders in Woking. Nostalgia cooled after a pathetic struggle to fasten Wrangler's \"70s cut\" button flares. On to Next, where the stretch Classics protruded strangely around my knees. At TK Max (the designer seconds store), the Pepe Nicole jeans were too short and balloon-like. Elbowing aside the male shoppers, I tried a pair of men's DKNY long blue zip denims (past season). Slightly low-rise, they fastened after a satisfyingly brief struggle. The length was excellent, the fit snug but not life-threatening. Best so far. My street cred improving, I hit Levi's and tried their Engineered Jeans. The fit was fantastic but (call me old-fashioned) I like my side seams at the sides, though the customised embroidery option was fun. The low-rise Gap Boy Fits, meanwhile, were too short and pleated around the derriere, and at Betty Barclay, the only jeans within budget were stretchy and comfortable but girlie and high-waisted. So it was back to TK Max for my almost perfect men's DKNY jeans - a bargain at \u00a324.99.",

Standing outside the Bricklayers Arms in \"London's fashionable Shoreditch\" recently, I had the good fortune to witness this phenomenon taken to new extremes. As we nursed our pints and coveted each other's trainers, a small tank roared round the corner and pulled up outside the boozer. Everyone gawped. Some even clapped. Of course, this being Shoreditch, by the time the driver emerged from the top of his camouflaged vehicle (wearing goggles), most of the punters had returned to their customary torpor. Perhaps Tank Boy was a regular sight round those parts, though I prefer to think that at this particular pub, the sight of Elvis Presley and John Lennon enjoying a pint would barely raise a yawn. </p> <p>Either way, it was a dramatic arrival. But for those who prefer a slightly less Schwarzenegger-esque entrance, summer 2000's must-have mode of transport is the Micro, a Swiss-designed scooter (that's \"scooter\" as in the kind you used to push along with one foot when you were a kid) that's fast becoming as much of an essential design item as the Philippe Starck lemon squeezer. </p> <p>The Micro is so gloriously silly, it was bound to be embraced by the fashion crowd. The craze first took off in - you guessed it - Japan, where it is rapidly overtaking Pokemon as the fad du jour, with sales currently topping 50,000 per week. Micros first arrived in this country last October, initially in \"cult\" outlets: skate shops, The Conran Shop (Terry's a big fan) and Paul Smith. This summer, now that they're available in large retailers nationwide (and already selling at a rate of 4,000 per week), they will soon be a regular sight on urban streets. You may have already spotted a few brave Micro-naut pioneers. The only golden rule is always to ride alone. Two people on them look like something out of the Red Hand Gang. </p> <p>On a smooth surface, Micros travel at a fair clip (pressing down on the back mudguard acts as a brake) and are a lot of fun. However, riders need to be ultra vigilant on your average British pavement, as even the smallest bump carries the risk of, at best humiliation, at worst auto-castration. Retailing at around \u00a3120, they are not cheap, but their USP lies in the fact that they are incredibly light and can be folded up, in about 15 seconds, to a size small enough to fit in your backpack. Thus you can ride one to the pub, chin six pints and not kill yourself trying to ride it home. </p> <p>To get an idea of the broad appeal of the Micro, you need only consider the disparate celebrities who have fallen for its charms. Norman Wisdom uses one to bomb around when he's in London. Jack Dee recently purchased one. Rappers Cypress Hill borrowed a fleet of them for one of their videos, Robbie Williams is a devotee and - the ultimate stamp of cool - Jude Law and Sadie Frost own one, which they ride around in the living room of their Primrose Hill abode. And you don't get much hipper than that. </p> <p>According to Dax Warner of Blue Room, one of the first skate shops to stock the Micro, even businessmen are being seduced by the scooter's speedy commuting potential. \"We had a 60-year-old barrister come in the other day,\" Warner says. \"He bought a Micro, unfolded it and scooted off to a meeting in his three-piece suit.\" </p> <p>But what if scooting doesn't grab you? Well, it's still vitally important to recognise which of the current crop of urban transportation fads will win you admiring glances as you pull up outside your local gastro-pub. Roller blades, for example, are fashion hara-kiri, while roller-skates are perenially cool (but only if you wear leg-warmers and can funk dance on them). Similarly, skateboards are a wise choice (for adults) only if you can travel insouciantly with your weight on your back foot and herald your arrival by pulling a massive \"ollie\" - risky, even for experts. Snake-boards are a rare sight these days due to being frankly impossible to use. And long-boards are just too much of a drag to carry when you're fighting to get to the bar. </p> <p>And what if you prefer to pedal rather than push? Mountain bikes, let's face it, are just too sensible and while the BMX has clung to a certain cachet, it is still essentially a kid's bike. The only cycle for an adult to be seen on is the Cruiser, the BMX's older brother, equipped with larger (24in) wheels so you don't look like an utter fool when you're pedalling. </p> <p>Mopeds and vespas, too, are starting to look a bit declass\u00e9. Instead, why not take it back to l'ancien ecole with that paradigm of French peasant chic, the SoleX. Created in the 40s, it's a black sit-up-and-beg bicycle with a two-stroke engine attached to the front wheel. A top speed of 23mph may not sound impressive until you consider average speed for a car in London is 11mph. And you can't be arguing with 200 miles to the gallon. </p> <p>So the message is, assuming you can't get your hands on a tank, go lo-fi this summer with a Micro.

Electors voted against the privatisation of the tube and the government should respect the voters' views. I can't believe this government which has taken such a drubbing at the polls believes that Londoners want to see the tube broken up.\"</p> <p>Mr Livingstone, referring to the demonstrations in the capital on May Day during which graffitti was daubed on the cenotaph, said that those behaving in that way would \"find this mayor distinctly uncuddly\".</p> <p>He added: \"My intention is to heal my wound with the Labour Party. The job of the mayor is to unite all parties in this city.\"</p> <p>Mr Livingstone was declared mayor just after noon and began his victory speech by saying: \"As I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted 14 years ago... I want an all-embracing administration that will speak with one voice on behalf of London.</p> <p>\"I hope after reflection my fellow candidates will want to help me in that work and hope they will join me in that administration.</p> <p>\"I believe in regional government. The government that is best is the government that is best for the people.</p> <p>\"I pledge to heal the division between myself and the Labour party and I hope the Blair government is elected for a second term.\"</p> <p>The new mayor paid tribute to Mr Dobson, saying: \"He has borne a terrible brunt of odium that should have been reserved for people behind the scenes.\"</p> <p>Earlier, Tony Blair said that he would work with the new mayor, though he cautioned that Mr Livingstone must use his power responsibly and made it plain that there was no love lost between them.</p> <p>\"It is important that we do everything we can to see that this works for London and Londoners. Ken also has a responsibility to make this work. I have not changed my views on Ken, but that has to be in the past. Ken also has a responsibility to make this work. The mayor has real power. We've got to make sure we play our part as the government in making this work.\"</p> <p>Mr Dobson, who gave no response to Mr Livingstone's invitation to join his London administration, said after the result: \"As a democrat, I respect the votes of the people of London. Personally, I'm deeply disappointed not to become mayor. It's a job I would have loved to have done.</p> <p>\"It was not always easy.

      "bodyText": "Ken Livingstone and Tony Blair both pledged today to put their differences behind them and work together for London after Mr Livingstone became London's first elected mayor, winning 776,427 votes against the Conservative Steven Norris's 564,137 after second preference votes were counted. On a turnout of 33.6%, the Labour candidate Frank Dobson finished third, only slightly ahead of Susan Kramer, the Liberal Democrat. Mr Livingstone and Tony Blair promised to heal the divisions between them but they cautioned each other to use their power responsibly. At a 3pm press conference, Mr Livingstone urged assembly members not to replicate the sterile politics of Westminster. \"Members should leave the caucus and the whip at the door and vote for what is best for London. \"I strongly welcome the statements by government ministers about their intention to cooperate with me and we are moving towards a meeting with the prime minister.\" He said he would work with Downing Street to solve London's transport problems but added: \"The government also has to co-operate with London. Electors voted against the privatisation of the tube and the government should respect the voters' views. I can't believe this government which has taken such a drubbing at the polls believes that Londoners want to see the tube broken up.\" Mr Livingstone, referring to the demonstrations in the capital on May Day during which graffitti was daubed on the cenotaph, said that those behaving in that way would \"find this mayor distinctly uncuddly\". He added: \"My intention is to heal my wound with the Labour Party. The job of the mayor is to unite all parties in this city.\" Mr Livingstone was declared mayor just after noon and began his victory speech by saying: \"As I was saying before I was so rudely interrupted 14 years ago... I want an all-embracing administration that will speak with one voice on behalf of London. \"I hope after reflection my fellow candidates will want to help me in that work and hope they will join me in that administration. \"I believe in regional government. The government that is best is the government that is best for the people. \"I pledge to heal the division between myself and the Labour party and I hope the Blair government is elected for a second term.\" The new mayor paid tribute to Mr Dobson, saying: \"He has borne a terrible brunt of odium that should have been reserved for people behind the scenes.\" Earlier, Tony Blair said that he would work with the new mayor, though he cautioned that Mr Livingstone must use his power responsibly and made it plain that there was no love lost between them. \"It is important that we do everything we can to see that this works for London and Londoners. Ken also has a responsibility to make this work. I have not changed my views on Ken, but that has to be in the past. Ken also has a responsibility to make this work. The mayor has real power. We've got to make sure we play our part as the government in making this work.\" Mr Dobson, who gave no response to Mr Livingstone's invitation to join his London administration, said after the result: \"As a democrat, I respect the votes of the people of London. Personally, I'm deeply disappointed not to become mayor. It's a job I would have loved to have done. \"It was not always easy. I believe our message was right, but we found it difficult to get that message across. \"I hope not too many people will feel that I have let them down. \"I have enjoyed the campaigning and I don't regret the decision to stand. I said what I thought, not what I thought people wanted to hear. I continue to believe that in a democracy we have to tell the people the truth whether it turns out to be popular or not.\" After a count of second preference votes, Mr Livingstone won the endorsement of 12 of London's 14 constituencies, with the Tories victorious only in West Central and Bexley and Bromley. Results \u0095Bexley and Bromley: Norris win. \u0095London South West: Livingstone win. \u0095Brent and Harrow: Livingstone win. \u0095Croydon and Sutton: Livingstone win. \u0095Greenwich and Lewisham: Livingstone win. \u0095Ealing and Hillingdon: Livingstone win. \u0095London North East: Livingstone win. \u0095Havering and Redbridge: Livingstone win. \u0095Enfield and Haringey: Livingstone win. \u0095Barnet and Camden: Livingstone win. \u0095Merton and Wandsworth: Livingstone win. \u0095Lambeth and Southwark: Livingstone win. \u0095West Central: Norris win. \u0095City and East: Livingstone win.",

      "body": "<p>The first Cannes film festival of the century - an inexorably expanding event with 1,397 new films assessed for entry, up 23% from last year, and 23 selected for official competition - will certainly have a perceptibly newer, more gleaming showcase. Another new venue has been built, the 300-seat Salle Luis Bu\u00f1uel, for special events and retrospectives, to add to its other theatres, the Lumi\u00e8re, the Debussy and the Bazin. </p> <p>Also, Cannes is to junk its traditional simultaneous English translation through uncomfortable headsets, where no subtitled print was available. The official festival website calls it a \"barbarity\" and has now replaced it with electronic subtitles everywhere - but the interpreters' attempts at acting will be greatly missed, particularly their doggedly earnest moans and groans for sex scenes. </p> <p>Otherwise, among the impossibly vast line-up, there is something familiar about the Cannes 2000 selection. In competition, Joel and Ethan Coen are back with <strong> O Brother, Where Art Thou?</strong>, a knockabout comedy starring George Clooney and John Turturro whose title alludes to the Preston Sturges classic, Sullivan's Travels. Ang Lee is out of competition with his action movie <strong> Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</strong>, and Lars Von Trier, a man whose career has been validated almost every step of the way at Cannes, is there with <strong> Dancer in the Dark</strong>, ostensibly a musical drama starring Bj\u00f6rk and Catherine Deneuve. </p> <p>Cannes has a way of amplifying to a deafening scale the mistakes and flip-flops of a director's career, and something about the Bj\u00f6rk/Deneuve/musical combination may be enough to make his admirers uneasy. Neil LaBute, whose In the Company of Men was one of the most sensational films of the 90s, is in competition with <strong> Nurse Betty</strong>, a funky-looking Couplandesque tale about a waitress in love with a soap-opera doctor, starring Renee \"Bridget Jones\" Zellweger. The estimable Ken Loach's new film at Cannes is <strong> Bread and Roses</strong>. </p> <p>In spite of these Anglophone directors, however, the flavour of this year's festival is distinctly Eastern and Middle-Eastern, something partly attributable to the continuing reluctance of US studios to submit their expensive babies to the festival's unpredictable, unspinnable brawl. (Lots more US projects are in fact out of competition, such as Stephen Hopkins's <strong> Under Suspicion</strong>, Darren Aronofsky's <strong> Requiem for a Dream</strong>, and John Waters' Hollywood spoof, <strong> Cecil B Demented</strong>.) </p> <p>Maybe the most awe-inspiring Cannes debut this year is that of 20-year-old Iranian director Samira Makhmalbaf, with <strong> Blackboards</strong>, about a group of teachers fleeing bomb-wrecked Iranian Kurdistan looking for someone, anyone to teach. From the Far East, likely candidates are Wong Kar-Wai's enigmatic <strong> Untitled</strong> (formerly called In the Mood for Love), about a Hong Kong newspaper editor's clandestine affair, and Edward Yang's <strong> Yi Yi</strong>, an involved family drama set in Shanghai. </p> <p>Despite this emphasis, there is not much Far or Middle-Eastern representation on the jury, which has a rather middlebrow flavour: chaired by Luc Besson, it features a lot of thesps, including our own Jeremy Irons and Kristin Scott Thomas. Perhaps they will smile on sturdily furnished costume and period extravaganzas like James Ivory's reading of Henry James's <strong> The Golden Bowl</strong>, or Arnaud Desplechin's <strong> Esther Kahn</strong>, an English-language movie about an East End Jewish woman in the 19th century who finds fulfilment in the theatre.</p> <p>A mouth-watering choice in the alternative Un Certain Regard section of the festival is Kristian Levring's <strong> The King Is Alive </strong> (aka Dogme 4), about an impromptu production of King Lear in the African desert. Filmed in accordance with the Dogme Group's vow of chastity, it features an international cast including Romane Bohringer, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Janet McTeer. </p> <p>It is in the Directors Fortnight strand that the New Brits are largely featured. Stephen Daldry's <strong> Dancer</strong>, Mark Herman's <strong> Purely Belter</strong>, and Simon Cellan-Jones's <strong> Some Voices</strong> are flying the flag for the British revival, though there is not quite the same credulity about celluloid Cool Britannia this year, and Chris Smith may not be putting in an owlish appearance on the Croisette. (But the British efforts here look a safer bet than <strong> Honest</strong>, another jocose Brit-gangster pic, out of competition, directed by ex-Eurythmic and Paradise Syndrome survivor Dave Stewart, and starring All Saints. The portents are not great.)</p> <p>It may be that just as last year the Directors Fortnight gave us The Blair Witch Project, it will spawn a left-field indie smash hit again in 2000, and contenders could be Karim Dridi's much-fancied <strong> Cuba Feliz</strong>, or Karyn Kusama's women's boxing picture, <strong> Girlfight</strong>.

Maybe the most awe-inspiring Cannes debut this year is that of 20-year-old Iranian director Samira Makhmalbaf, with Blackboards, about a group of teachers fleeing bomb-wrecked Iranian Kurdistan looking for someone, anyone to teach. From the Far East, likely candidates are Wong Kar-Wai's enigmatic Untitled (formerly called In the Mood for Love), about a Hong Kong newspaper editor's clandestine affair, and Edward Yang's Yi Yi, an involved family drama set in Shanghai. Despite this emphasis, there is not much Far or Middle-Eastern representation on the jury, which has a rather middlebrow flavour: chaired by Luc Besson, it features a lot of thesps, including our own Jeremy Irons and Kristin Scott Thomas. Perhaps they will smile on sturdily furnished costume and period extravaganzas like James Ivory's reading of Henry James's The Golden Bowl, or Arnaud Desplechin's Esther Kahn, an English-language movie about an East End Jewish woman in the 19th century who finds fulfilment in the theatre. A mouth-watering choice in the alternative Un Certain Regard section of the festival is Kristian Levring's The King Is Alive (aka Dogme 4), about an impromptu production of King Lear in the African desert. Filmed in accordance with the Dogme Group's vow of chastity, it features an international cast including Romane Bohringer, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Janet McTeer. It is in the Directors Fortnight strand that the New Brits are largely featured. Stephen Daldry's Dancer, Mark Herman's Purely Belter, and Simon Cellan-Jones's Some Voices are flying the flag for the British revival, though there is not quite the same credulity about celluloid Cool Britannia this year, and Chris Smith may not be putting in an owlish appearance on the Croisette. (But the British efforts here look a safer bet than Honest, another jocose Brit-gangster pic, out of competition, directed by ex-Eurythmic and Paradise Syndrome survivor Dave Stewart, and starring All Saints. The portents are not great.) It may be that just as last year the Directors Fortnight gave us The Blair Witch Project, it will spawn a left-field indie smash hit again in 2000, and contenders could be Karim Dridi's much-fancied Cuba Feliz, or Karyn Kusama's women's boxing picture, Girlfight.

Expect to hear plenty more of this kind of talk over the next few days. Cross-party inclusivity is already Livingstone's theme of the hour. The man who once terrorised the suburbs as Red Ken may have just secured the largest ever electoral victory by a candidate to the left of Labour. But the former Greater London council leader has no intention of scaring off bits of the coalition he assembled for his electoral comeback. While New Labour, the Tories and their media friends have been vying to brand him a threat to jobs and public order, the Brent East MP has been busy wooing London business organisations and the police. Now he will offer the hand of cooperation to the government, the newly-elected Greater London authority members and the London boroughs. Armed with his new powers of patronage and Tony Blair's pledge not to seek confrontation with the mayor - at least this side of the general election - getting his way with the GLA should not prove an insuperable task. But for all Livingstone's studied magnanimity, there are some bottom-line issues his closest advisers insist are not negotiable, foremost of which is opposition to the partial sell-off of the London Underground. Speculation that Livingstone is planning a graceful climbdown on this issue is wrong, one insists. \"We have no technical powers to block them, but Ken regards this election as having been a referendum on tube privatisation and we're looking to stop the PPP\". At his victory party on Thursday night, Livingstone signalled that the greening of London would be a central theme of his administration.

      "bodyText": "Scottish police investigating the Lockerbie disaster flew to Rome and Germany within days of the bombing to study similar atrocities involving a Palestinian group, the Lockerbie trial in Holland was told today. Retired detective chief inspector Gordon Ferrie said that the tragedy was treated as a murder inquiry from the day after it happened. The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine General Command (PFLPGC) quickly became the \"focus of attention\" because of arrests of some of its members in Germany only two months before Pan Am 103 exploded over Lockerbie. They included a man known as Marwan Kreeshat, a technical expert who had been jailed for 18 years in his absence for his part in placing a bomb in a record player on an El Al flight from Rome to Tel Aviv in 1972. He had been arrested by the Germans in October 1988, the court was told, but released in December, before the Lockerbie bombing later the same month. About ten senior officers from the Lockerbie inquiry spent weeks at the German headquarters of the BKA, the German equivalent of the FBI, the court heard. The two Libyans accused of the bombing, Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi and Al Amin Khalifa Fhimah, deny charges of murder and conspiracy to murder, and they have lodged special defences in which they incriminate, among others, members of the PFLPGC. Under cross-examination Mr Ferrie confirmed he had been sent to Rome twice to study the El Al incident, in which two British women had been befriended by three men - including Marwan Kreeshat - and persuaded to take a record player on board the plane. They did not know it contained a bomb. El Al security measures ensured the record player went into the bomb-proof luggage hold, instead of in the passenger cabin. Fortunately, although the device exploded at about 13,000ft and blew a hole in the passenger floor, the plane landed back at Rome safely. Mr Ferrie brought back to Lockerbie some of the Italian evidence in the case, including part of an altimeter which had been used in the bomb's trigger. Questioned by Richard Keen QC, representing Fhimah, Mr Ferrie confirmed that in Rome he had discovered that Kreeshat had been involved in other incidents \"using improvised explosive devices\", including the bombing of a plane using a Toshiba radio cassette recorder modified to act as a bomb. The Lockerbie trial indictment accuses Megrahi and Fhimah of placing an \"improvised explosive device\" concealed inside a Toshiba radio cassette recorder on board an Air Malta flight to Frankfurt labelled for onward connection to New-York bound Pan Am Flight 103 at Heathrow. Asked if Kreeshat was believed to be \"an agent of a Middle Eastern intelligence service\", Mr Ferrie replied: \"I can't answer to that.\" Re-examined by Alan Turnbull QC, prosecuting, Mr Ferrie was asked: \"There came a stage when the inquiry led officers in a direction other than the PFLP, weren't there?\" Mr Ferrie agreed. However, when he then asked Mr Ferrie what the eventual result of the police inquiry was, defence lawyers objected that it was hearsay evidence, because Mr Ferrie had later been moved to other work. Questioned by Mr Keen for Fhimah, Mr McLean insisted that, although FBI and CIA agents from America were swiftly on the scene of the disaster, all evidence found was \"religiously and meticulously\" logged, including items recovered by the CIA. The trial continues.",

The government that is best is the government that is best for the people. \"I pledge to heal the division between myself and the Labour party and I hope the Blair government is elected for a second term.\" The new mayor paid tribute to Mr Dobson, saying: \"He has borne a terrible brunt of odium that should have been reserved for people behind the scenes.\" Earlier, Tony Blair said that he would work with the new mayor, though he cautioned that Mr Livingstone must use his power responsibly and made it plain that there was no love lost between them. \"It is important that we do everything we can to see that this works for London and Londoners. Ken also has a responsibility to make this work. I have not changed my views on Ken, but that has to be in the past. Ken also has a responsibility to make this work. The mayor has real power. We've got to make sure we play our part as the government in making this work.\" Mr Dobson, who gave no response to Mr Livingstone's invitation to join his London administration, said after the result: \"As a democrat, I respect the votes of the people of London. Personally, I'm deeply disappointed not to become mayor. It's a job I would have loved to have done. \"It was not always easy. I believe our message was right, but we found it difficult to get that message across. \"I hope not too many people will feel that I have let them down. \"I have enjoyed the campaigning and I don't regret the decision to stand. I said what I thought, not what I thought people wanted to hear. I continue to believe that in a democracy we have to tell the people the truth whether it turns out to be popular or not.\" After a count of second preference votes, Mr Livingstone won the endorsement of 12 of London's 14 constituencies, with the Tories victorious only in West Central and Bexley and Bromley. Results \u0095Bexley and Bromley: Norris win. \u0095London South West: Livingstone win. \u0095Brent and Harrow: Livingstone win. \u0095Croydon and Sutton: Livingstone win. \u0095Greenwich and Lewisham: Livingstone win. \u0095Ealing and Hillingdon: Livingstone win. \u0095London North East: Livingstone win. \u0095Havering and Redbridge: Livingstone win. \u0095Enfield and Haringey: Livingstone win. \u0095Barnet and Camden: Livingstone win. \u0095Merton and Wandsworth: Livingstone win. \u0095Lambeth and Southwark: Livingstone win. \u0095West Central: Norris win. \u0095City and East: Livingstone win. The final result was announced at 12.20pm after many delays caused by malfunctioning computers. The hi-tech optical-reading counting machine introduced for the first time at this election crashed a few hours after polls closed in Enfield. \"We have tested these machines to destruction,\" returning officer Robert Hughes said. \"It is only an embarrassment if we fail to solve it but we can. The only way that there would fail to be a result today would be if we had a total computer failure and had to do the count by hand. If that happened we would be looking at a result in a week's time.\" \"People have four possible votes and without this computer system not only would it take five days to count, it would take more staff.\"",

      "bodyText": "Although Ken Livingstone's opinion poll rating inevitably slumped from the 68% high recorded by ICM on March 6, the day he left the Labour party to run as an independent mayoral candidate, the surveys repeatedly showed that he attracted an unprecedented level of support from all parts of the political spectrum. As a BBC/ICM poll published last night again confirmed, those who backed Livingstone were not doing so primarily because they \"wanted to give Tony Blair a kick\", or because they thought he had been treated unfairly by Labour, but because they said they saw him as the \"best champion for London\". Despite the repeated disclosures about his personal finances that undermined his \"bloke in the pub\" image, the political rows over his claims that capitalism kills more people each year than Hitler, and his apparent support for the City of London rioters last June, the polls continued to show that Labour, Liberal Democrat and Conservative voters were not going to peel away in large enough numbers to send Livingstone into a dive in the ratings in the final days of the campaign. Indeed, his level of support never dipped below the bedrock 49% of first preference votes he recorded in last November's Guardian/ICM poll. Even then, it was clear that Frank Dobson, as the official Labour candidate, was in danger of being pushed into a humiliating third place and left out of any second-round run-off if Livingstone failed to secure outright victory on the first count. But perhaps it is the breadth of cross-party support that is most remarkable about Livingstone's campaign and which may contain the clearest guide to his future conduct as mayor of London. For, completely contrary to the class warrior image that the hard left likes to portray, Livingstone has actually managed to straddle the class divide in London more effectively than Dobson or Norris ever achieved. As the last Evening Standard/ICM poll published on April 27 showed, Livingstone had the support of London's middle classes with 57% of ABC1 voters - the professional and managerial classes - and took the lion's share, 44%, of support of the C2DEs - the manual workers and those living on state benefits. Intriguingly, this presents him with the very New Labour dilemma, if he wants to be re-elected in four years, of how to retain his radicalism without turning London's middle classes, many of them Tory voters, against him. The key may lie in the finding of the ICM poll for last night's BBC election programme, Vote 2000, that 89% of those who voted for Livingstone thought he would be best at standing up for London. Interestingly this poll also found that only 45% of those voting believed that the mayor should decide how improvements to the tube should be funded - the prime issue in the campaign - and 32% were happy to see the government determine the issue.

The earth and moon were on one side of the sun and five planets - Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn - were strung out on the other.</p> <p>3.

The actor who portrays the teenage Anakin - whose personal journey takes him from wide-eyed Jedi trainee to scarred evildoer - will join the current cast of Natalie Portman, Ewan McGregor, and Samuel L. Jackson, all veterans from Episode I. According to Harry Knowles of Ain't it cool news, the casting of Christen is confirmed, as is Ryan Phillippe as Bail Organa. Similarly, Star Wars fan site www.theforce.net reports that Christensen signed the Anakin contract yesterday, and will be appearing in both Episode Two and Episode Three. \u0095 Check the Star Wars official site for the final word.",

He was called back to Cannes on the final day of the festival with the promise of a prize from the international jury.

He hates the fuss anyway and doesn't look forward to the endless interviews he is always subjected to there, often by people who haven't seen the film.

But there is this parallel world of people from Central America who come in illegally, who do the worst jobs and, because they are without papers, are very easy to exploit. </p> <p>\"Our story is pretty simple. It's about a girl who crosses the border illegally and joins her sister as a janitor. It's about what happens to them, their relationship as sisters and their work. We found casting difficult at first because there are a lot of Hispanic actresses in LA, but the fact of being so near to Hollywood means they inevitably start to fit the mould that the industry expects. The corners seemed to be knocked off them. Obviously where you live affects who you become. So we went to Mexico and found a nice girl [Pilar Padilla] there.\" </p> <p>Loach admits that in other respects, too, he was in a tricky situation. The film is about unions as well as the girls' lives, and he is a staunch supporter. But in LA, unlike Britain, where there are only two unions to deal with when making a film, there are four or five. Everybody eventually did a deal with this impecunious British film-maker despite the fact that his total budget was pretty hilarious to them at around $5m. </p> <p>The most difficult, however, were the drivers. There is only one for most Loach films. Everything and everyone else goes in the minibus. Here they insisted on 10 drivers for eight vehicles, and the drivers had to have separate lavatories. \"There we were, filming in LA where every building has a toilet and we had to have portable lavatories so that the drivers could go for a pee next to the minibus cars rather than across the road. </p> <p>\"Frankly they gave trade unionism a bad name because in a place where workers are largely black and Hispanic, they were all white 50-year-old rednecks with lumpen attitudes. No one else could get into that union. </p> <p>\"For me, LA is the most horrible city in the world. We did the shoot in downtown areas which have these huge buildings that are real mirror images of multinational power. Each corporation tries to build the tallest tower. It's horrible, and so are the lives of those who service them. It's not exactly a romantic film, but I hope it brings these people to life, and I hope it's entertaining too.\" </p> <p>As usual, Loach uses professionals and amateurs in the cast. \"Put them together and they help each other. The ones who aren't actors don't know the actors' tricks. So when they're playing a scene they can only give it to you straight. The process of auditioning is quite rigorous. You can't have someone who dries up or appears self-conscious. But once you've got that right, it's simple. You treat everybody the same. </p> <p>\"The trick is to appear both arbitrary and casual. To make people think the story is just unfolding totally naturally and by the end show them something that makes a kind of sense about the people you're talking about. Everybody making the film has to share that feeling, and the moment you or the audience sees a nice bit of camerawork or direction, you know you've failed.\" </p> <p>As far as Bread and Roses is concerned, he hopes it explores something you seldom see on film - what happened to work. \"We used to have jobs that lasted for life.

Tel: 020-7226 9791. </p> <p> Surprising numbers of people ignore the glitzier restaurants along Upper Street to find their way here (Denise Van Outen is a fan, but you're more likely to be noshing alongside less high-profile Islingtonites). Visitors are rewarded with smiles from friendly, unhurried staff. But if you're coming for a quick bite, you'll have to resist the temptation of a leisurely meal. Those who don't settle in for an hour or two aren't penalised, though, as the takeaway menu offers the same, unmistakably Italian, dishes. Chef Francesco Scala's pasta and risotti are expertly done, and those with larger appetites would be advised to choose one of the stomach-challenging pizzas. A cheap eat, too. </p> <p><strong>Cheapskate . . . where to eat out for under \u00a315</strong></p> <p> <strong> Pasha</strong> , 301 Upper Street, London N1. Tel: 020-7226 1454. </p> <p> Elegant Turkish restaurant. Moves with Ottoman calm and measured pace and proffers a brilliant lunch bargain in the form of mixed meze, some hot some cold, yours for a princely \u00a34.95. Now there's meze and there's meze. Pasha's are fresh, light, clean flavoured, precisely spiced or freshly herbed. What you get may depend on the mood of the kitchen, but there'll be the usual standbys, hummus and taramasalata and the great aubergine dish imam bayildi carried out with eye-opening excellence. A heap of tabbouleh, something with aubergines, a borek or two, maybe a delicate kofte, some grilled hellim cheese and chicken in walnut sauce. Sunday lunch is a bargain, too, \u00a38.95 for two courses, \u00a310.95 for three.</p> <p><strong> On the menu: oyster sauce</strong></p> <p><strong> What is it?</strong> A staple of Chinese cooking available in bottles. From Canton originally. </p> <p><strong> And, tell me truthfully, does it contain oysters?</strong> It does. </p> <p><strong> Oh my god!</strong> And water, salt, cornflower and caramel colouring. </p> <p><strong> That's better. So what's it used for?</strong> Originally to add a dash of exotic flavour to those distinctly non-Chinese dishes, chop suey and chow mein. These days it's a general purpose gunk to add to meat, fish, noodles or veg. Very tasty. </p> <p><strong> But those oysters!</strong> <br> <strong> <strong> Food on the net</strong></strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.wwrecipes.com\">www.wwrecipes.com</a> </p> <p>An odd one, this. On the one hand, it's a straightforward recipe service, sending out daily emails which, over the course of a week, make up a gourmet meal. On the other, it's an often bizarre foodie community, with the personal musings of recipe creator \"The Chef\" popping up alongside directions on how to stuff an Argentinian flank steak. </p> <p><strong> Pros: </strong> Assumes you know your way around the kitchen and are able to track down unusual ingredients. A few weeks' worth of emails amounts to quite a repertoire of dishes. </p> <p><strong> Cons:</strong> Serious recipes, but some might find the \"zany\" humour of The Chef rather perplexing. </p> <p><strong> Charges:</strong> It's free.</p>",

Surprising numbers of people ignore the glitzier restaurants along Upper Street to find their way here (Denise Van Outen is a fan, but you're more likely to be noshing alongside less high-profile Islingtonites). Visitors are rewarded with smiles from friendly, unhurried staff. But if you're coming for a quick bite, you'll have to resist the temptation of a leisurely meal. Those who don't settle in for an hour or two aren't penalised, though, as the takeaway menu offers the same, unmistakably Italian, dishes. Chef Francesco Scala's pasta and risotti are expertly done, and those with larger appetites would be advised to choose one of the stomach-challenging pizzas. A cheap eat, too. Cheapskate . . . where to eat out for under \u00a315 Pasha , 301 Upper Street, London N1. Tel: 020-7226 1454. Elegant Turkish restaurant. Moves with Ottoman calm and measured pace and proffers a brilliant lunch bargain in the form of mixed meze, some hot some cold, yours for a princely \u00a34.95. Now there's meze and there's meze. Pasha's are fresh, light, clean flavoured, precisely spiced or freshly herbed. What you get may depend on the mood of the kitchen, but there'll be the usual standbys, hummus and taramasalata and the great aubergine dish imam bayildi carried out with eye-opening excellence. A heap of tabbouleh, something with aubergines, a borek or two, maybe a delicate kofte, some grilled hellim cheese and chicken in walnut sauce. Sunday lunch is a bargain, too, \u00a38.95 for two courses, \u00a310.95 for three. On the menu: oyster sauce What is it? A staple of Chinese cooking available in bottles. From Canton originally. And, tell me truthfully, does it contain oysters? It does. Oh my god! And water, salt, cornflower and caramel colouring. That's better. So what's it used for? Originally to add a dash of exotic flavour to those distinctly non-Chinese dishes, chop suey and chow mein. These days it's a general purpose gunk to add to meat, fish, noodles or veg. Very tasty. But those oysters! Food on the net www.wwrecipes.com An odd one, this. On the one hand, it's a straightforward recipe service, sending out daily emails which, over the course of a week, make up a gourmet meal. On the other, it's an often bizarre foodie community, with the personal musings of recipe creator \"The Chef\" popping up alongside directions on how to stuff an Argentinian flank steak. Pros: Assumes you know your way around the kitchen and are able to track down unusual ingredients. A few weeks' worth of emails amounts to quite a repertoire of dishes. Cons: Serious recipes, but some might find the \"zany\" humour of The Chef rather perplexing. Charges: It's free.",

I was never afraid when Paolo went off hunting. I've certainly never been afraid of the elephants in my garden.\" </p> <p>Kuki Gallmann, widow, mother, internationally acclaimed author and conservationist, is not very happy. I Dreamed of Africa, the film adaptation of her autobiography, opens today in the US and she is quickly discovering the pitfalls of handing over your life to Hollywood. </p> <p>\"I know, times change and things change. But this is a year 2000 depiction of my life in the 1970s,\" she says. </p> <p>It is easy to understand why Hollywood was attracted to Gallmann's life, despite her initial (and, apparently, unresolved) reluctance to see \"all that drama up on screen\". Born just outside of Venice in 1943, Kuki (her name is pronounced \"cookie\") moved to Kenya with her husband Paolo and son Emanuele in 1972. They bought a ranch in the Laikipia region and revelled in their new, exotic life. Shark fishing, buffalo hunting and flying around the continent in private planes became part of their daily life, a far cry from the claustrophobic grey gloom of a Venetian winter. </p> <p>But eight years later, Paolo was killed in a car crash on his way to pick up a cradle for his and Kuki's soon-to-be-born daughter, Sveva. Three years later Emanuele, then aged 17, died in Kuki's arms after he was bitten by one of his pet snakes. </p> <p>At this point, most people would probably have packed up and gone home, leaving with nothing but sad memories of their African adventure. Gallmann, however, stayed put. Determined \"to make something positive out of the tragedy\", in 1983 she established the Gallmann Memorial Foundation - in memory of her husband and son - dedicated to conservation and anti-poaching programmes, research into the use of the region's medicinal plants and promotion and sponsorship of the education of Kenyans. </p> <p>When she is not working at the foundation in Kenya, she flies around the world, raising international aid for it. It took her agent and myself almost a week to track her down, chasing her by telephone and email from New York to Toronto to London to Kenya. </p> <p>In the three parts of her autobiography - I Dreamed of Africa, African Nights and Night of the Lions - Gallmann manages to write about her life and achievements without slipping into sanctimonious smugness or overwrought sentimentality. She describes Africa without romanticising it or resorting to scenes of alien quaintness - this isn't Out of Africa meets A Year in Provence. And although she didn't learn English until she was an adult (self-taught from Victorian novels \"about governesses and paupers\") her books are beautifully, elegantly written, enlivened with wonderful details of her life in Africa: the smell of elephants, the sound of a leopard's cough, the feel of the desert dust after the rain. </p> <p>Although Gallmann stresses that her main aim in writing the books (and giving her consent to the film) was to present a side of Africa not often seen on television, she admits that there was, inevitably, a cathartic aspect as well: \"Some people - I've never done it - go to a psychoanalyst, lie on a couch and tell a stranger their problems. That's what happens, isn't it? Well, since I was a little girl, the white page has been my psychoanalysis.\" </p> <p>Through her books she looks \"for clues for solving the absurd puzzle\"; trying to find a logical progression leading up to her senseless losses. </p> <p>I Dreamed of Africa is punctuated by terrible tragedies - crippling car accidents, the death of friends and friends' children. It is as if Gallmann, in retrospect, sees her life as a series of disasters, preparing her (and the reader) for her greatest tragedy - the loss of her husband and son. </p> <p>Take romance, loss, rejuvenation and a clear plot, chuck in some stunning vistas and a sweeping soundtrack, plus a politically correct eco-message: hey presto, you have Hollywood magic. Or so thought the 15 or so producers who approached Gallmann as soon as her first book was published. Initially, she was unwilling to hand over her life into \"unknown hands\", but in the end she signed away the rights to her book to Stanley R Jaffe, already a producer of two films that deal with a lone female struggling against the odds - The Accused and Fatal Attraction. </p> <p>Although Gallmann enthuses about Jaffe and the director Hugh Hudson (who made Chariots of Fire), she had her doubts. She questioned why most of the film was shot outside of Kenya, and felt there was a \"lack of magic\" on screen between Basinger and Vincent Perez, who plays Paolo. She feels happier after having seen the movie at the New York premiere last week (\"Not a dry eye in the house!\"), but still has her reservations. \"It is difficult to concentrate a life down to two hours. The film is a rendition of the book, and the book is a rendition of my life, so I knew it would not be the same.\" </p> <p>But Gallmann's main concern was Basinger. Despite Basinger's praise for Gallmann as \"an individual with dreams and the fortitude to pursue them\", the actress seems to have decided to treat Kuki Gallmann as a fictional character: not once, to Gallmann's chagrin, did Basinger arrange to meet her character's real-life counterpart. \"The director, the producers and the scriptwriter all spent time with me in Laikipia. The only person who didn't come was Kim. Perhaps she felt a little insecure, and she had her own ideas about her interpretation of me. </p> <p>\"You know,\" she hastily adds, \"I'm not an actor, I don't know anything about actors. The only time I see movies is when I'm on an airplane, so I don't know how actors approach these things. Kim is good with the script she was given. But, you know, we're very different people: she's an actress in the US, I live in the bush.\" </p> <p>So what about the film itself? \"Well, I'm not really the ideal audience. The ideal audience member has never met me, never been to Africa, never read my books. For that person, they will be hit by the film, no doubt about that.\" </p> <p>But now that Gallmann is back home in Laikipia, she has more important things on her mind: she is finishing off two more books, there's the day-to-day running of her 100,000 acre ranch, not to mention preparations for the wedding of Sveva, now 20 and studying at Oxford. But it is her charitable foundation that remains Gallmann's primary concern. Just before we hang up she asks me: \"Have you been to Kenya yet?\"</p>",

      "trailText": "<b>What's the mayor's first job in office?</b>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<b>What's the mayor's first job in office?</b> <p>Before anything else, the mayor must appoint a deputy from the Greater London Authority (GLA). The deputy will act as an adviser and stand-in, and, like the mayor, will have a seat on the newly created Metropolitan Police Authority. Other appointments will also have to made, including a cabinet of experts, who the mayor can appoint to a range of new public bodies in the city. The job creation doesn't stop there: the mayor's office - led by a chief of staff - will act as an in-house think-tank.</p> <p><b>Does the mayor get to spend money on anything other than salaries?</b></p> <p>The Greater London Assembly Act (1999) which established London's devolved government, gives the GLA power over public expenditure for the capital's police service, the fire brigade, transport system and economic development. The mayor will draw up a budget for providing those services, and submit it to the GLA for approval. Last year, those services cost \u00a33.3 billion.</p> <p><b>So if the GLA gives it the OK, the mayor can spend whatever he wants on whatever he feels like?</b></p> <p>Not quite. Much of the money the mayor is allowed to spend will come from central government, with strings attached. Whichever government department allocates money to London will have a veto over how it is spent. </p> <p><b>So what can the mayor do about, say, transport?</b></p> <p>Quite a lot. As part of the shake-up of London's government, a new body governing all transport will be created by merging London Transport, the Traffic Director of London and the parts of the Highways Agency and the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions which deal with the capital. The result will be Transport for London, and the mayor will not only chair the body, he will also appoint its members. Transport for London will have overall responsibility for all transport in the capital, and it may promote legislation in parliament if it wishes. Perhaps its most obvious power is the ability to decide public transport fares. The mayor will, ultimately, have the power to introduce road tolls and special parking fees, although not immediately upon taking office.</p> <p><b>And the police?</b></p> <p>Once again, a lot of the mayor's power lies in making appointments. In all, 12 out of the 23 members of the Metropolitan Police Authority will be appointed by the mayor. The authority itself is a new creation, taking away the home secretary's direct supervision of the Met. The mayor's budget also determines funding for the police in London. It must, however, exceed a minimum level set by the Home Office, or the home secretary can rule that London will be inadequately policed, and force the mayor to allocate the police more money from the budget. The mayor also appoints and oversees the new London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority</p> <p><b>What about the economy?</b></p> <p>The principle change will be the creation of the London Development Agency, which will take over central government's responsibility for distributing inward investment to London, and economic regeneration grants. Once again, however, much of the funding will be earmarked grants that can only be spent as central government departments dictate. The mayor will also take on responsibility for wider strategic planning, developing a \"Spatial Development Strategy\", which will deal with economic development, urban regeneration and housing issues. </p> <p><b>Anything else?</b></p> <p>The other principle area of the mayor's power is over environmental and cultural matters.

      "bodyText": "What's the mayor's first job in office? Before anything else, the mayor must appoint a deputy from the Greater London Authority (GLA). The deputy will act as an adviser and stand-in, and, like the mayor, will have a seat on the newly created Metropolitan Police Authority. Other appointments will also have to made, including a cabinet of experts, who the mayor can appoint to a range of new public bodies in the city. The job creation doesn't stop there: the mayor's office - led by a chief of staff - will act as an in-house think-tank. Does the mayor get to spend money on anything other than salaries? The Greater London Assembly Act (1999) which established London's devolved government, gives the GLA power over public expenditure for the capital's police service, the fire brigade, transport system and economic development. The mayor will draw up a budget for providing those services, and submit it to the GLA for approval. Last year, those services cost \u00a33.3 billion. So if the GLA gives it the OK, the mayor can spend whatever he wants on whatever he feels like? Not quite. Much of the money the mayor is allowed to spend will come from central government, with strings attached. Whichever government department allocates money to London will have a veto over how it is spent. So what can the mayor do about, say, transport? Quite a lot. As part of the shake-up of London's government, a new body governing all transport will be created by merging London Transport, the Traffic Director of London and the parts of the Highways Agency and the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions which deal with the capital. The result will be Transport for London, and the mayor will not only chair the body, he will also appoint its members. Transport for London will have overall responsibility for all transport in the capital, and it may promote legislation in parliament if it wishes. Perhaps its most obvious power is the ability to decide public transport fares. The mayor will, ultimately, have the power to introduce road tolls and special parking fees, although not immediately upon taking office. And the police? Once again, a lot of the mayor's power lies in making appointments. In all, 12 out of the 23 members of the Metropolitan Police Authority will be appointed by the mayor. The authority itself is a new creation, taking away the home secretary's direct supervision of the Met. The mayor's budget also determines funding for the police in London. It must, however, exceed a minimum level set by the Home Office, or the home secretary can rule that London will be inadequately policed, and force the mayor to allocate the police more money from the budget. The mayor also appoints and oversees the new London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority What about the economy? The principle change will be the creation of the London Development Agency, which will take over central government's responsibility for distributing inward investment to London, and economic regeneration grants. Once again, however, much of the funding will be earmarked grants that can only be spent as central government departments dictate. The mayor will also take on responsibility for wider strategic planning, developing a \"Spatial Development Strategy\", which will deal with economic development, urban regeneration and housing issues. Anything else? The other principle area of the mayor's power is over environmental and cultural matters. On the environment, the mayor is obliged to implement strategies to deal with ambient noise and rubbish, as well as safeguarding air quality and biodiversity. Once during every four-year term, the mayor will publish a \"global\" report on the state of the environment in London. In the cultural sphere, the mayor will direct city-wide action on the arts, sport and tourism: the bid to host the Olympic Games is a prime example. And yet again, there are jobs to be given out. The Cultural Strategy Group for London, appointed by the mayor, will advise the GLA on culture. So is it fair to say that the mayor's powers have been exaggerated by all the attention the election has generated? A little, but it's worth remembering that the mayor's influence extends beyond his legally bestowed powers. As the elected representative of more than eight million people, whoever lands the job will have a greater public mandate than any other politician in Britain. As the chief spokesperson for the capital, the mayor's voice will be very hard to ignore, even for cabinet ministers who, technically, have far more power over London.

It is not every day they land on your desk.

      "bodyText": "Sam Mendes shocked the world of theatre last night by revealing that the first play he is to direct since winning an Oscar will be by an unknown author. After his American Beauty triumph, the British director took Hollywood by surprise by saying that he was dying to return to the Donmar Warehouse, a small London theatre he had put on the map with his Tony Award-winning production of Cabaret and of The Blue Room starring Nicole Kidman. Now Mendes has ditched his plans to direct Twelfth Night in favour of a drama called To The Green Fields Beyond, which is set in a tank on the western front during the first world war, and written by the relatively obscure Nick Whitby. \"Shakespeare can wait,\" Mendes said last night. \"You have to take advantage of a good and exciting new play like this. It is not every day they land on your desk. One of the benefits of running a theatre is that you can change the programme when you need to.\" A spokeswoman for the Donmar said Twelfth Night would be staged next year instead, although casting had actually begun before the change of plan. \"Sam read To The Green Fields Beyond and went 'Wow!' said the spokeswoman. \"He really loved it, so he thought 'what the hell!' It is a fascinating piece, and it's a very unusual subject.\" The play revolves around a multiracial crew of a tank during the Somme offensive in September 1916. The generals hoped that the new weapon would turn around the war, stuck in a battle of attrition, by being able to break through the German lines. But most of the tanks broke down with mechanical failures on their first outing at the Somme, long before they got in sight of German trenches, and failed to break the stalemate. In contrast to army tradition, the new tank corps recruited from all corners of the British empire, and moreover its tank commanders were \"ordinary blokes\" rather than officers. Whitby, in his early thirties, has written comedy for TV but is best known for a play, Dirty Dishes, that has been a hit in Germany. Mendes, 34, said last month that he was happy to direct one play a year until the right film script came along: \"There are not as many of them out there as you think.\" He has formed his own film company, called Donmar, backed by the DreamWorks studio, and even persuaded its boss, Steven Spielberg, to donate money to the theatre. The head of Miramax, Harvey Weinstein, is also keen to secure Mendes' services, and is investing in the Donmar production of Tom Stoppard's The Real Thing on Broadway.",

I'm glad she routinely turns down movies and scripts containing nude scenes and deflowerings, and I dread the day she starts swearing and baring 'em.</p> <p> No, Where the Heart Is forces me to admit that I have a serious problem with that genre of movies commonly dismissed as \"Chick Flicks\". I just can't get enough of them. It's a habit I just can't kick. \"Weepie\", \"Women's Picture\", \"Chick Flick\" - call them what you like, but whenever a movie appears that looks like it'll require three hankies, I'm there front and centre, clutching my tear-stained Kleenex like the biggest Jessie in the 48 states.</p> <p> And I mean literally front and centre: Row five, right where the curtain splits, to make sure that no one can hear me snuffling or see me reaching for the huge pile of napkins I've appropriated from the concession stand in the lobby.</p> <p>For weepies I always head for one of the multiplexes in nearby Glendale (Mildred Pierce country), and make sure I hit the weekday Twilight show between five and seven.

I've had many a nice chat in the lobby with venerable old dears who can't believe that a heterosexual male in his thirties was the person howling his way through Meryl Streep's death scene in One True Thing or the last 10 minutes of Magnolia.</p> <p> Well, call me a big softie. I don't care. Being a cry-baby has its advantages, especially if you take a date. Most women in America are stunned if a man suggests going to see something romantic. They're used to the kind of mouth-breathing yahoo frat-boys who drag their dates to see the new Steven Seagal action-atrocity instead of My Best Friend's Wedding (not a film I had much time for, but no matter).</p> <p>But once the lights go down and that first silvery tear flows down my cheek, I often feel a hand slipping under my arm and a head suddenly resting on my shoulder. Then I find myself repressing a lascivious chuckle (\" 'ere we go!\") even as I grope in the dark for more hankies.</p> <p> To be honest, though, I think the age of the great weepie is far behind us. The genre belongs to the pre-ironic era, before Method acting, before the 1960s, before the onset of universal cynicism about girly stuff like true romance and endless love.</p> <p> Sometime in the mid-1950s, the producer Ross Hunter and Douglas Sirk, his favourite director (and mine), were putting the final touches to the script of one of their magnificent melodramas when Hunter lurched to his feet, stabbed the page with a pencil and cried, \"Douglas, I want 500 handkerchiefs to come out right here!\" And come the premiere, I'll bet that linen flapped like a million surrenders.</p> <p>I wish movie producers were like that today, but obviously they aren't. I just know that if push came to shove I'd trade in both Godfathers and most Martin Scorsese movies for just five minutes of All That Heaven Allows or Written on the Wind. Or Mildred Pierce, The Enchanted Cottage, or Letter From an Unknown Woman.</p> <p>These days though, a three-hankie movie is more likely to mean Cherry Cheeks 3 or Buttman's Backdoor to Buttsville, Part Six. Plus *a change... The last zone of creative endeavour unsullied by irony is, of course, country music, so it's in that milieu that one finds today's equivalent of the old Women's Picture: country music biopics like Coal Miner's Daughter and Sweet Dreams, or indomitable Southern gal stories like Places in The Heart or (ak!) Steel Magnolias.</p> <p>Where The Heart is fits snugly into that tradition. Billie Letts's novel is the kind of supermarket best-seller that I'll never bring myself to read (I'll bet it gives The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood a run for its money), but which makes excellent raw material for the big screen.</p> <p> Natalie plays 15-year-old Novalee Nation, literally barefoot and pregnant as she leaves her trailer park home for California. She's dumped by her worthless boyfriend outside a Wal-Mart in Oklahoma, and ends up hiding out at night in the store for two months until she gives birth to a child the tabloids instantly dub \"the Wal-Mart baby\". Thereafter she's warmly enclosed in the bosom of this rag-tag little town, as if she and her baby were gifts fallen from the sky.</p> <p> Her best friend is Lexie Coop (Ashley Judd), whose life, despite her innate wisdom and strength, is all about getting knocked up and knocked around by a series of worthless boyfriends. Novalee is taken in by Alcoholics Anonymous member Sister Husband, whose pre-prandial prayers usually culminate with the imprecation, \"and please lord, forgive the fornicatin' that took place on this here dinner table this very afternoon\".</p> <p> The next five years of Novalee's life are a sucession of thunderstorms and tornadoes, good men and bad, crazy Christians, weddings and babies (Judd pops them out like a baseball pitching machine), deaths and funerals, tragedy and triumph. Oh, and tears and laughter. It's as if screenwriters Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel (kings of the superslick crowd-pleaser) have adapted Loretta Lynn's The Pill, Dolly Parton's Just Because I'm a Woman and George 'n' Tammy's divorce album The Battle.</p> <p>Natalie holds the film together like a country-fried version of Phoebe Caulfield, the wise little sister in The Catcher in the Rye, sweet as a butterfly, sharp as a tack. Praise the Lord, and pass the Kleenex.</p>",

These days though, a three-hankie movie is more likely to mean Cherry Cheeks 3 or Buttman's Backdoor to Buttsville, Part Six. Plus *a change... The last zone of creative endeavour unsullied by irony is, of course, country music, so it's in that milieu that one finds today's equivalent of the old Women's Picture: country music biopics like Coal Miner's Daughter and Sweet Dreams, or indomitable Southern gal stories like Places in The Heart or (ak!) Steel Magnolias. Where The Heart is fits snugly into that tradition. Billie Letts's novel is the kind of supermarket best-seller that I'll never bring myself to read (I'll bet it gives The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood a run for its money), but which makes excellent raw material for the big screen. Natalie plays 15-year-old Novalee Nation, literally barefoot and pregnant as she leaves her trailer park home for California. She's dumped by her worthless boyfriend outside a Wal-Mart in Oklahoma, and ends up hiding out at night in the store for two months until she gives birth to a child the tabloids instantly dub \"the Wal-Mart baby\". Thereafter she's warmly enclosed in the bosom of this rag-tag little town, as if she and her baby were gifts fallen from the sky. Her best friend is Lexie Coop (Ashley Judd), whose life, despite her innate wisdom and strength, is all about getting knocked up and knocked around by a series of worthless boyfriends. Novalee is taken in by Alcoholics Anonymous member Sister Husband, whose pre-prandial prayers usually culminate with the imprecation, \"and please lord, forgive the fornicatin' that took place on this here dinner table this very afternoon\". The next five years of Novalee's life are a sucession of thunderstorms and tornadoes, good men and bad, crazy Christians, weddings and babies (Judd pops them out like a baseball pitching machine), deaths and funerals, tragedy and triumph. Oh, and tears and laughter. It's as if screenwriters Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel (kings of the superslick crowd-pleaser) have adapted Loretta Lynn's The Pill, Dolly Parton's Just Because I'm a Woman and George 'n' Tammy's divorce album The Battle. Natalie holds the film together like a country-fried version of Phoebe Caulfield, the wise little sister in The Catcher in the Rye, sweet as a butterfly, sharp as a tack. Praise the Lord, and pass the Kleenex.",

      "body": "<p>American director Lodge Kerrigan made his second feature Claire Dolan over two years ago. It gets a limited British release, but for a while was in danger of being the film that time forgot. Critics at Cannes in 1998, squeezing it into a five-a-day schedule, took a deep breath, found Kerrigan's film \"distant and removed\" - the usual epithets - and quickly filed it away as a noble failure. Kerrigan, ensconced in his Brooklyn apartment gives a booming Jolly Green Giant laugh, and points out that, like most films, Claire Dolan benefits from a little time and attention. </p> <p>\"I remember running into a British critic in Cannes who was up till 3.30 in the morning and was going to see an Angelopoulous film at 9am the next day. I thought, that's not really the best state to see a lyrical, slow-moving film. I think it's a responsibility of the critic to commit to giving a film the proper attention. If a film-maker takes a year, two years of his life to make a film, is it too much to ask that a critic can actually watch it without a hangover?\" </p> <p>Viewed again in the cold light of sobriety, Claire Dolan is a powerful piece of work. It's the story of a young woman, played by Katrin Cartlidge, living in New York and trying to find her way out of prostitution. It's also a film about cities, architecture and glass: from the opening credits, Kerrigan and cinematographer Teodoro Maniaci sheet the screen with abstract swathes of geometrically-patterned windows. </p> <p>Claire Dolan is entirely unvoyeuristic, although it's very much an essay on voyeurism and urban living. \"In my old apartment,\" Kerrigan says, \"I could look across the courtyard into the lives of maybe 15 other people - families, couples, whatever. You have a choice - you can either close your blinds and shut out the world, or you can emotionally shut down to some degree and just not care that people can see into your life. Claire, when she's turning all these tricks, is doing them in front of other hotel buildings where hundreds of people could be watching her do that.\" </p> <p>Claire Dolan may have confounded some critics because, despite its sometimes explicit matter-of-factness about a prostitute's routine, it doesn't offer any easy exposures. \"If you go to a strip club,\" says Kerrigan, \"there's usually one guy who's absolutely convinced the stripper is stripping for him - that regardless of the other people in the room, there's this more personal intimate relationship. In films that deal with prostitution, the audience actually expects that - they're put in this position where the prostitute opens up and reveals something to them. It's very titillating in that regard, and this film totally rejects that.\" </p> <p>Because of these preconceptions, Kerrigan complains, \"few critics have talked about what the film is really about, which is a woman struggling to change her life. Certain male critics have just discussed whether they find Katrin Cartlidge attractive or seductive enough, like they're looking for a Bardot.\" </p> <p>Certainly, any preconceptions about Cartlidge as an actress, based on her full-on, rather caricatural edge in Mike Leigh's films, are overturned in Claire Dolan. Her performance is all the more commanding for its absolute restraint, thick with the discomfort of half-glimpsed emotions under a tightly-reined surface. </p> <p>\"The emotions are very internal,\" Kerrigan says. \"I don't like to rely on dialogue and exposition to tell a tremendous amount of the story. There are other interesting ways that people communicate.\" Kerrigan so wholeheartedly rejects the usual certainties of film storytelling that it's not always easy to tell exactly what's happening in Claire Dolan, and what the characters' relationships really are. \"Connect-the-dots is just trivial. I prefer films where the audience have to figure it out for themselves - it's more like life. I've never understood why it all has to be crystal clear.\" </p> <p>This oblique attitude to narrative and style must make it harder for Kerrigan to find financing? \"Yeah - so?\" Claire Dolan was financed by French company MK2, after American funding fell through. This doesn't strictly make Kerrigan a French film-maker, but he certainly has more in common with the strategies of European art cinema than with the commercial level-headedness that defines even the American independent fringe these days.</p> <p>If you want to make tougher, more oblique films, Kerrigan says, then you just have to be financially disciplined. \"It's my responsibility as a film-maker to make sure the investors make their investment back. If you're unsure whether your film will break even, you should reduce your budget. My films are not audience-friendly, they're not date movies - but they have made money.\" </p> <p>Kerrigan learned cash management the hard way. His first feature, Clean, Shaven from 1994 - \"an amateur film\", he calls it - cost $60,000 and took three years to make. \"I'd shoot a little, run out of money, go shoot some more, and it was everything I love about film-making. I couldn't believe it when it was over - 'Isn't there anything else I have to do?' \"</p> <p>Anyone who saw Clean, Shaven won't easily forget the way that the sound design and rough, tarnished look gave you the feeling of spying on the schizophrenic hero from inside his head. The film was the result of Kerrigan's extensive research, both on paper and at New York's Bellevue mental hospital. \"I wanted an audience to see what it might feel like to be schizophrenic. Everything in it is related to something which is medically known. People affected by mental illness are the least able to defend themselves in a political arena so hopefully, on some level, it made a difference and made people question their prejudices.\" </p> <p>Kerrigan seems to have a leisurely approach to getting films made. He doesn't like sending his scripts out - \"Very few people know how to read screenplays\" - and Claire Dolan only reached its financier via French director Jacques Audiard, whom Kerrigan had met at a writing workshop. He also got Katrin Cartlidge for the lead simply because he happened to meet her, and likes to give his scripts to actors to look at, because they're good at sifting out inconsistencies. We may have to wait some time for a third feature: in between university teaching stints, Kerrigan has been planning two architectural documentaries and several feature ideas. The ones most likely to get made are a Blow-Up-style investigation of infanticide, and a political drama about campaign finance abuse. </p> <p>Even though he's likely to make a bigger-scale feature next, Kerrigan is champing at the bit to go micro-budget again. \"I'm interested in digital video but not for the standard reasons. I want to use a lot of hidden cameras - have a crew of two, three people maximum and have actors interact in live environments, instead of trying to control reality. Like - art-direct it, get actors, extras, props, everyone in costumes, rehearse it?\" Kerrigan lets out a booming laugh, incredulously. \"That's almost like doing a period piece!\"</p>",

Even his death last year did little to reduce the steady flow of fantastic tales about his future projects, and top of the list has been the sci-fi epic, AI. Kubrick had nurtured this project for more than 20 years, and it was announced as his next project several times. But ultimately, it outlived him. </p> <p>Last year, the AI saga took a new turn when it was announced that Steven Spielberg had decided to direct the film, with a release planned for summer 2001. With no known direct connection between the two directors, the news came as something of a surprise, but they were close associates, and their film careers were bizarrely intertwined.</p> <p>Had it not been for Spielberg, in fact, Kubrick's film legacy might have taken an entirely different shape. \"They are both great writers but they have different handwriting,\" says Jan Harlan, Kubrick's brother-in-law and long-standing executive producer. \"They are similar in their intellect. They are both very fast and very, very bright.\" As unofficial earthly representative of Kubrick, a close friend for more than 40 years and the sole link between Spielberg's AI and Kubrick's, Harlan is in the perfect position to clear up decades of speculation surrounding the director. </p> <p>\"He and Spielberg spoke all the time,\" he continues. \"I have six or seven years' worth of correspondence between them over AI, which I recently passed over to Spielberg along with over 1,000 drawings.\" Harlan has recently read Spielberg's new script and is very enthusiastic about it. He has seen the initial models and designs (\"mind-bogglingly wonderful\", \"huge teams of people\"), and though he is still sworn to secrecy on the details, he confirms that Haley Joel Osment (the boy from The Sixth Sense) and Jude Law are both on board. </p> <p>AI (short for Artificial Intelligence) is an adaptation of a 1969 short story by Brian Aldiss called Super-Toys Last All Summer Long, to which Kubrick bought the rights in 1983. Set in a flooded futuristic world, the story is like a robot version of Pinocchio, centring on an android boy with human emotions. \"Stanley took that idea and projected it into the future, not only the child but the society as well,\" Harlan explains. \"He always liked to tackle new things and a really fantastic fairy tale was something he hadn't done yet.\" </p> <p>Spielberg's own fantastic sci-fi fairytale, ET, had been released the year before, and it had an influence on Kubrick in the same way that 2001: A Space Odyssey had influenced Spielberg to make Close Encounters of the Third Kind. At the same time as AI, however, there were two other stories Kubrick had been grooming for development for decades: Eyes Wide Shut, to which he had bought the film rights in 1972, and a second world war project called The Aryan Papers. These three projects were intensively developed, then put on the back burner for the rest of Kubrick's life. </p> <p>After an initial bout of work on AI with Aldiss in the early 70s, it was shelved, partly in response to Star Wars. So The Aryan Papers was the frontrunner after Kubrick finished Full Metal Jacket in 1987. \"Kubrick always wanted to do a film on the Holocaust, but he never got a good script,\" says Harlan. He had tried to commission an original screenplay from the novelist Isaac Bashevis Singer (who turned it down on the grounds that he knew nothing about the Holocaust), before settling on an adaptation of the novel Wartime Lies, by Lewis Begley. </p> <p>\"We were very committed to do this film,\" Harlan recalls. \"We had done enormous amounts of research and preparation, but there came a point when he and Warner boss Terry Semel decided it would be better to do AI first. It had to do with Schindler's List,\" he said. \"It was such a good film and so successful, and Stanley's film would have come out about a year later. He'd already had this experience with Full Metal Jacket, which came out the year after Platoon, and that hurt us, there's no question about it.\" So in 1995, The Aryan Papers was abandoned and Kubrick returned to AI. </p> <p> Aldiss contributed sporadically, and other writers were brought in, including another British sci-fi writer, Ian Watson, and novelist Sara Maitland. By this stage, the internet community had discovered the project, and rumours started to fly on a daily basis, fuelled by Kubrick's secrecy and refusal to communicate with the press. There was the rumour, for example, that AI had begun production in the early 90s, and that Kubrick was shooting Joseph Mazzello (one of the child actors from Jurassic Park) for four weeks at a time every couple of years. \"Total nonsense,\" Harlan replies, \"although we did test Joseph and he was put on a contract, but then he didn't do the film.\" </p> <p>What about the rumoured involvement of Chris Cunningham, futuristic video director for the likes of Madonna, Bj\u00f6rk and Aphex Twin and part-time robot designer? \"We did try to build remote control machines and stuff like that. We tried to construct a little boy with a movable rubber face to see whether we could make it look appealing. But it was a total failure, it looked awful.\" </p> <p>How much of the footage had already been shot before he died? \"We did some test shots from a helicopter of oil rigs in the North sea. We wanted to see the sea during really bad weather. That was all.

So he said, 'The longer we wait, the better'.\" </p> <p>Thus AI was put on the back burner again, and Eyes Wide Shut became Kubrick's final film. Like AI, it had been in Kubrick's possession since the 70s, and had been worked and reworked from Schnitzler's source material. \"He was stuck on it for 20 years. He didn't know how to end it,\" Harlan remembers. \"At one point, about 15 years ago, he was totally high for a week. He said, 'I have a brilliant idea: I'll do it in New York and I'll have Woody Allen playing the lead. It makes total sense!'

      "trailText": "<p><strong>Peter Bradshaw:</strong> Carrey plays Kaufman the same throughout, in good times and bad, with no growth and no progression... Milos Forman opts for a very easy, cloying sentimentality to close his film about a difficult, bloody-minded comedian</p>",
      "main": "",
      "body": "<p> Films about great comics have a similar problem to films about (fictional) painters. You can show the painter being brilliant and drunk in a cafe, or brilliant and angry with agent or gallery-owner, or brilliant and inspired in his at\u00e8lier. But sooner or later the camera has to peep, however cursorily, at what is actually on the canvas, and risk all that assumed brilliance looking a bit thin. The problem arises with the short and troubled life of Andy Kaufman, the subject of Man On The Moon. A volatile stand-up-comedian-cum-situationist-hoaxer, Kaufman is now remembered here, if at all, for his squeaky-voiced Latka in the early 80s TV show Taxi. </p> <p>But he was also a cult figure in the US for his anarchic performances on Saturday Night Live, Letterman, Johnny Carson and playing live on the lucrative college circuit or in Vegas as his alter ego, the appalling lounge singer Tony Clifton. Jim Carrey, in a solemn and conspicuous act of ancestor worship, plays Kaufman, and Milos Forman directs: a return to his familiar themes of madness and creative inspiration. But we never get much more than a few seconds' continuous showing of Kaufman's act, his \"comedy canvas\", and maybe that is as it should be. </p> <p>The film does an efficient sleight-of-hand job of suggesting comic genius: Kaufman dying on stage at the Improv club; cut to shot of audience looking baffled and irritated; cut to shot of Kaufman ploughing on; cut to audience smiling, shrugging, starting to laugh. And afterwards,Kaufman's agent George Shapiro (Danny DeVito) chuckles prescriptively: \"You're insane! But you might also be brilliant!\" QED. </p> <p>Man On The Moon cannot risk attempting to be funny on its own account; it has to establish a complementary tone of respectful, bittersweet drama as a showcase for the implied comic genius. And considering how profoundly conservative American network television was and is, it is remarkable how far Kaufman was allowed to go: mad stunts on air, attacking and humiliating the audience, \"a single-minded pursuit of anarchy\" from which he appears never to have been spiritually seduced by a parallel career in a top-rated middle-of-the-road network TV show. (Judd Hirsch and most of the original cast of Taxi appear in the film, unsmilingly enduring once again the trial of looking like pedestrian schmucks compared to Kaufman's mercurial talent, but not DeVito, who has interestingly promoted himself out of the Taxi cast to play someone in on the gag.) But this wild and crazy guy died from lung cancer at the age of 35, a career move which took him into the realm of legend and away from playing, say, the silver-haired lead in Father of the Bride 2. </p> <p>What could and should have been interesting about Andy Kaufman's life is how he reacted to failure: he had hardly reached the top when public and fellow artists alike wearied of being his straight man, and turned against him. He was getting a bad press and was voted off Saturday Night Live in a viewers' phone poll that Kaufman clearly believed he would win: a rare stunt of which he was not in control. </p> <p>But Carrey plays Kaufman the same throughout, in good times and bad, with no growth and no progression, with the same blinking, moon-faced detachment, a sort of halfway-house between Kaufman's weird, deadpan live act and an assumed professional backstage reserve. One of the most incredible things about Kaufman is his self-appointed position as World Inter-Gender Wrestling Champion, challenging women, quite genuinely, to wrestle him. </p> <p>At the time, this was considered the nadir of jarring unfunniness: the very quintessence of being on the comedic skids. But now, in its magnificent lack of taste, it looks like an inspired take on the sex wars: with Kaufman as a cross between Norman Mailer and Bobby Riggs. It is a pity that Forman didn't expand this gloriously offensive part of Kaufman's career. And it only hints at the final irony: when Kaufman had to tell his family he was dying of cancer, his furious sister contemptuously suspected him of staging the ultimate, bad-taste stunt. In real life, Kaufman claimed to have met Elvis Presley by smuggling himself into the kitchen of the Las Vegas Hilton. This meeting is not dramatised on screen: perhaps because that might overload the Troubled Genius quotient. </p> <p>But in his final scene, Forman hints at an Elvis-style resurrection for Andy, suggesting that he might actually have faked his death after all. Well, let's assume Andy Kaufman is up in Valhalla with John Belushi, while Robin Williams, Chevy Chase, Dan Aykroyd and Eddie Murphy labour in the world of mediocrity below, what is the point of Kaufman's career? </p> <p>The family is shown to be upset at what they suspect is Andy's Ultimate Cancer Put-On, but the next thing we know they have come to terms with it, and uncomplicatedly embrace Andy's career in its tragic final act: a tear-jerking final concert in Carnegie Hall: a very tame ending for his comedy guerrilla, like Che Guevera joining the Liberal Democrats. Milos Forman opts for a very easy, cloying sentimentality to close his film about a difficult, bloody-minded comedian.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Films about great comics have a similar problem to films about (fictional) painters. You can show the painter being brilliant and drunk in a cafe, or brilliant and angry with agent or gallery-owner, or brilliant and inspired in his at\u00e8lier. But sooner or later the camera has to peep, however cursorily, at what is actually on the canvas, and risk all that assumed brilliance looking a bit thin. The problem arises with the short and troubled life of Andy Kaufman, the subject of Man On The Moon. A volatile stand-up-comedian-cum-situationist-hoaxer, Kaufman is now remembered here, if at all, for his squeaky-voiced Latka in the early 80s TV show Taxi. But he was also a cult figure in the US for his anarchic performances on Saturday Night Live, Letterman, Johnny Carson and playing live on the lucrative college circuit or in Vegas as his alter ego, the appalling lounge singer Tony Clifton. Jim Carrey, in a solemn and conspicuous act of ancestor worship, plays Kaufman, and Milos Forman directs: a return to his familiar themes of madness and creative inspiration. But we never get much more than a few seconds' continuous showing of Kaufman's act, his \"comedy canvas\", and maybe that is as it should be. The film does an efficient sleight-of-hand job of suggesting comic genius: Kaufman dying on stage at the Improv club; cut to shot of audience looking baffled and irritated; cut to shot of Kaufman ploughing on; cut to audience smiling, shrugging, starting to laugh. And afterwards,Kaufman's agent George Shapiro (Danny DeVito) chuckles prescriptively: \"You're insane! But you might also be brilliant!\" QED. Man On The Moon cannot risk attempting to be funny on its own account; it has to establish a complementary tone of respectful, bittersweet drama as a showcase for the implied comic genius. And considering how profoundly conservative American network television was and is, it is remarkable how far Kaufman was allowed to go: mad stunts on air, attacking and humiliating the audience, \"a single-minded pursuit of anarchy\" from which he appears never to have been spiritually seduced by a parallel career in a top-rated middle-of-the-road network TV show. (Judd Hirsch and most of the original cast of Taxi appear in the film, unsmilingly enduring once again the trial of looking like pedestrian schmucks compared to Kaufman's mercurial talent, but not DeVito, who has interestingly promoted himself out of the Taxi cast to play someone in on the gag.) But this wild and crazy guy died from lung cancer at the age of 35, a career move which took him into the realm of legend and away from playing, say, the silver-haired lead in Father of the Bride 2. What could and should have been interesting about Andy Kaufman's life is how he reacted to failure: he had hardly reached the top when public and fellow artists alike wearied of being his straight man, and turned against him. He was getting a bad press and was voted off Saturday Night Live in a viewers' phone poll that Kaufman clearly believed he would win: a rare stunt of which he was not in control. But Carrey plays Kaufman the same throughout, in good times and bad, with no growth and no progression, with the same blinking, moon-faced detachment, a sort of halfway-house between Kaufman's weird, deadpan live act and an assumed professional backstage reserve. One of the most incredible things about Kaufman is his self-appointed position as World Inter-Gender Wrestling Champion, challenging women, quite genuinely, to wrestle him. At the time, this was considered the nadir of jarring unfunniness: the very quintessence of being on the comedic skids. But now, in its magnificent lack of taste, it looks like an inspired take on the sex wars: with Kaufman as a cross between Norman Mailer and Bobby Riggs. It is a pity that Forman didn't expand this gloriously offensive part of Kaufman's career. And it only hints at the final irony: when Kaufman had to tell his family he was dying of cancer, his furious sister contemptuously suspected him of staging the ultimate, bad-taste stunt. In real life, Kaufman claimed to have met Elvis Presley by smuggling himself into the kitchen of the Las Vegas Hilton. This meeting is not dramatised on screen: perhaps because that might overload the Troubled Genius quotient. But in his final scene, Forman hints at an Elvis-style resurrection for Andy, suggesting that he might actually have faked his death after all. Well, let's assume Andy Kaufman is up in Valhalla with John Belushi, while Robin Williams, Chevy Chase, Dan Aykroyd and Eddie Murphy labour in the world of mediocrity below, what is the point of Kaufman's career? The family is shown to be upset at what they suspect is Andy's Ultimate Cancer Put-On, but the next thing we know they have come to terms with it, and uncomplicatedly embrace Andy's career in its tragic final act: a tear-jerking final concert in Carnegie Hall: a very tame ending for his comedy guerrilla, like Che Guevera joining the Liberal Democrats. Milos Forman opts for a very easy, cloying sentimentality to close his film about a difficult, bloody-minded comedian.",

      "body": "<p>William Hague's Tories suffered a crushing defeat in the Romsey byelection early today, as the Liberal Democrats overturned a Tory majority of more than 8,000 to snatch the traditionally true blue seat.</p> <p>In a stunning political upset, the Lib Dems' Sandra Gidley captured 19,571 votes to Tory Tim Palmer's 16,260, a majority of 3,311. The Labour candidate Andrew Howard lost his deposit with 1,451 votes.</p> <p>In a sometimes bitter contest, marked by rows over Mr Hague's asylum policies, the swing was 12.5% from the Lib Dems to the Tories. It represents one of the few occasions of the past 100 years when the opposition party has lost a seat in a byelection.</p> <p>The loss of the once-safe Hampshire seat, made vacant when old-school Tory Michael Colvin died in a fire at his home last February, is a devastating blow both for the Tories and for Mr Hague's leadership.</p> <p>Ms Gidley said: \"This is a sensational result. We have reminded people of what the Conservatives did in the 18 years that they were in government. People having been reminded are not ready to forgive.\"</p> <p>The Romsey result took the gloss off an otherwise encouraging night for Tories as the party achieved its best local election results in nearly a decade, far outstripping Mr Hague's expectations.</p> <p>Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy was jubilant: \"By giving William Hague's Conservative party a bloody nose in Romsey we are proving definitively that his far-right saloon-bar politics are not fooling the country's voters.\"</p> <p>The Tory campaign chief, John Hayes, said: \"Clearly, as often in byelections, this is a freak result. The Labour party's result has completely collapsed and the Lib Dems have benefited accordingly.\"</p> <p>Victory for the Lib Dems came after a hyperactive campaign, which saw the party flood hundreds of activists into the seat. The Tories got off to a slower start and failed to motivate more than their core support to visit the polling booths.</p> <p>The Lib Dems' success relied significantly on wooing tactical Labour voters anxious to keep out the Tories, and on attracting disaffected former supporters of both other parties. They tempted switchers by stressing the local credentials of their candidate.</p> <p>In the local elections Labour was toppled from power in heartland areas including Oldham and Hartlepool. The Tories also won back Eastbourne, which they last controlled in 1988, and the former Tory bastions of Southend-on-Sea and Stratford-on-Avon, which the party lost in 1994.</p> <p>A Labour inquest was launched after the Tories won back symbolically important councils such as Solihull, the first time they will have controlled a metropolitan district council since 1995.</p>",

      "bodyText": "William Hague's Tories suffered a crushing defeat in the Romsey byelection early today, as the Liberal Democrats overturned a Tory majority of more than 8,000 to snatch the traditionally true blue seat. In a stunning political upset, the Lib Dems' Sandra Gidley captured 19,571 votes to Tory Tim Palmer's 16,260, a majority of 3,311. The Labour candidate Andrew Howard lost his deposit with 1,451 votes. In a sometimes bitter contest, marked by rows over Mr Hague's asylum policies, the swing was 12.5% from the Lib Dems to the Tories. It represents one of the few occasions of the past 100 years when the opposition party has lost a seat in a byelection. The loss of the once-safe Hampshire seat, made vacant when old-school Tory Michael Colvin died in a fire at his home last February, is a devastating blow both for the Tories and for Mr Hague's leadership. Ms Gidley said: \"This is a sensational result. We have reminded people of what the Conservatives did in the 18 years that they were in government. People having been reminded are not ready to forgive.\" The Romsey result took the gloss off an otherwise encouraging night for Tories as the party achieved its best local election results in nearly a decade, far outstripping Mr Hague's expectations. Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy was jubilant: \"By giving William Hague's Conservative party a bloody nose in Romsey we are proving definitively that his far-right saloon-bar politics are not fooling the country's voters.\" The Tory campaign chief, John Hayes, said: \"Clearly, as often in byelections, this is a freak result. The Labour party's result has completely collapsed and the Lib Dems have benefited accordingly.\" Victory for the Lib Dems came after a hyperactive campaign, which saw the party flood hundreds of activists into the seat. The Tories got off to a slower start and failed to motivate more than their core support to visit the polling booths. The Lib Dems' success relied significantly on wooing tactical Labour voters anxious to keep out the Tories, and on attracting disaffected former supporters of both other parties. They tempted switchers by stressing the local credentials of their candidate. In the local elections Labour was toppled from power in heartland areas including Oldham and Hartlepool. The Tories also won back Eastbourne, which they last controlled in 1988, and the former Tory bastions of Southend-on-Sea and Stratford-on-Avon, which the party lost in 1994. A Labour inquest was launched after the Tories won back symbolically important councils such as Solihull, the first time they will have controlled a metropolitan district council since 1995.",

Despite enduring what he called an \"absolutely vile campaign from start to finish\", Mr Livingstone was in a conciliatory mood before heading home from the Westminster counting centre shortly after 2am.

In the 25-member Greater London assembly, Labour is expected to win the most seats overall, although the 11 seats distributed proportionally should prevent any one party having an overall majority, as well as ensuring the presence of the Green party. Green mayoral candidate Darren Johnson said his party was having \"a very good night\" and predicted two or \"hopefully three\" seats on the new London assembly. \"We are going to be a massive new influence in London politics,\" Mr Johnson said, although the rumour that Mr Livingstone could make him his deputy appeared confounded by Mr Livingstone's comment yesterday that his deputy would be someone with previous experience of government.",

Their success in Solihull also has great symbolic significance as the Tories win back control of their first metropolitan district council since 1995.</p> <p>One of the Tories' strongest results came in Torbay, the one council in the West Country that Mr Hague was determined to win back. The Tories lost control of the 36-seat council in 1990 and suffered the humiliation of holding just five seats in the mid-990s.</p> <p>But last night they gained 19 seats, to secure 32 of the 36 seats. The Liberal Democrats, who hold the local parliamentary seat by a mere 12 seats, will be horrified after they lost 14 seats, taking them down to just four seats.</p> <p>Richard Cumming, Torbay's new Tory leader, said during the campaign that the Tories had to do well in Torbay to show that they were back on the electoral map. He said last night that his strong performance, after Mr Hague made two trips to Devon coastal resort during the campaign, shows that the Tory leader's controversial speeches over the past month have paid off.</p> <p>Tory strategists were also relieved to have won back Solihull in the West Midlands, suggesting that fears over the job losses at Longbridge may be translating into votes. The Tories needed two gains to win back the council, but they managed to win back four seats. Conservatives last controlled the council in 1991 after ruling it continuously from the 1970s.</p> <p>The other symbolic wins for the Tories include:</p> <p>\u0095 Eastbourne, which the Tories have not controlled since the late 1980s. Conservatives gained three seats on the council to win 18 seats on the council to the Lib Dems' 12. The two parties have been tied at 15 seats each.</p> <p>\u0095 Stratford-on-Avon, which the Tories lost in 1994. The Tories gained four seats to win 28 seats on the council to 18 for the Lib Dems. The council has been under no overall control since the mid-1990s.</p> <p>\u0095 Rossendale, which the Tories lost back in 1986. The Tories gained nine seats, with Labour losing nine, making it one of the few councils with councillors from only the two main parties.</p> <p>\u0095 Amber Valley, which the Tories lost in 1991. The Conservatives were particularly pleased with the result in the Derbyshire council where they won 21 seats, with Labour losing 20 seats.

      "bodyText": "William Hague always knew he would do well in yesterday's local council elections after the Tory meltdown in the mid-1990s, when Labour captured seats across the country in Conservative heartlands. But the Tory leader was delighted by the size of his gains, estimated to be more than 400, which independent electoral experts described as a strong showing. The Conservatives have at last regained councils, such as Torbay and Eastbourne, in what were once their heartland areas. Their success in Solihull also has great symbolic significance as the Tories win back control of their first metropolitan district council since 1995. One of the Tories' strongest results came in Torbay, the one council in the West Country that Mr Hague was determined to win back. The Tories lost control of the 36-seat council in 1990 and suffered the humiliation of holding just five seats in the mid-990s. But last night they gained 19 seats, to secure 32 of the 36 seats. The Liberal Democrats, who hold the local parliamentary seat by a mere 12 seats, will be horrified after they lost 14 seats, taking them down to just four seats. Richard Cumming, Torbay's new Tory leader, said during the campaign that the Tories had to do well in Torbay to show that they were back on the electoral map. He said last night that his strong performance, after Mr Hague made two trips to Devon coastal resort during the campaign, shows that the Tory leader's controversial speeches over the past month have paid off. Tory strategists were also relieved to have won back Solihull in the West Midlands, suggesting that fears over the job losses at Longbridge may be translating into votes. The Tories needed two gains to win back the council, but they managed to win back four seats. Conservatives last controlled the council in 1991 after ruling it continuously from the 1970s. The other symbolic wins for the Tories include: \u0095 Eastbourne, which the Tories have not controlled since the late 1980s. Conservatives gained three seats on the council to win 18 seats on the council to the Lib Dems' 12. The two parties have been tied at 15 seats each. \u0095 Stratford-on-Avon, which the Tories lost in 1994. The Tories gained four seats to win 28 seats on the council to 18 for the Lib Dems. The council has been under no overall control since the mid-1990s. \u0095 Rossendale, which the Tories lost back in 1986. The Tories gained nine seats, with Labour losing nine, making it one of the few councils with councillors from only the two main parties. \u0095 Amber Valley, which the Tories lost in 1991. The Conservatives were particularly pleased with the result in the Derbyshire council where they won 21 seats, with Labour losing 20 seats. The result will be bad news for the two Labour MPs whose seats are in the council boundaries. \u0095 Cherwell, which the Tories lost in 1995. The Tories gained seven seats, with Labour losing six. \u0095 Great Yarmouth, which the Tories lost in 1986. They gained seven seats, with Labour losing seven and overall control of the council. The result will please the Tories because independent polling experts predicted that Labour would hold the council. \u0095 Hyndburn, which the Tories lost in 1986. The Tories won eight seats, with Labour losing the same number. The Tories will also be delighted by the result in the Lancashire council because the result was predicted as a dead heat. Before the Tories get too carried away with last night's results, wiser heads will remind the party that they are still a long way from challenging Labour at the general election. The Conservatives were bound to do well last night because Labour was defending seats in areas it was surprised to win in the mid-1990s, when the Tories plummeted to an all-time low.

Counting machines in the London constituency of Enfield and Haringey were blighted by technical problems which might delay the official announcement of mayor, Labour sources said. Experiments with electronic counting were not confined to London. It was also being used for the first time in Bury, Salford, and the Hertfordshire districts of Broxbourne and Three Rivers.

      "bodyText": "Up to 180,000 troops will be needed if the European Union is to establish a credible defence capability, the Europe minister, Keith Vaz, said yesterday. The EU is planning a conference this year at which member states will be expected to make radical and expensive commitments to a new European expeditionary force capable of imposing peace in trouble spots such as the Balkans. The force, agreed in principle at the Helsinki EU summit, is due to be in place by June 2003. The \"capabilities pledging conference\", initially proposed by the British, is seen as the only way in which to pressurise some EU nations into making the commitments necessary to create a force intended to be 60,000 strong and capable of going into the field for a year. Under questioning by Lord Inge, former chief of the British defence staff, Mr Vaz conceded that a force 60,000 strong at a single time may require an overall fighting pool of 180,000 troops. Mr Vaz told a hearing of the Lords EU select committee: \"Distinguished military people have put to me the 3-1 ratio. Soldiers have to rest and eat. They are human beings.\" British defence chiefs are not publicly naming the countries they fear will not properly contribute to the EU defence force, but the Foreign Office is alarmed that Germany is already spending less than 2% of gross domestic product on defence and Chancellor Schr\u00f6der is now imposing defence cuts. Mr Vaz said: \"It is not for a British minister of Europe to tell Germany what to spend, but it is right to remind all countries what they have signed up to at Helsinki.\" He also accepted Lord Inge's assertion that serious gaps existed in Europe's capability, including heavy lift, communications and intelligence. Lord Robertson, the Nato secretary general, and Geoff Hoon, the defence secretary, have also been disturbed by the scale of defence cuts envisaged in Germany. General Klaus Naumann, the chairman of the Nato military committee until last year, told the Lords hearing that Germany could contribute a two-brigade division, but the recent German defence budget was \"absolutely insuffi cient to meet the requirements of Helsinki\". The capabilities conference will produce a \"headline catalogue\" setting out the force's needs for different scenarios, including crisis management, conflict resolution and peacekeeping. Ministers said this week they envisage the capabilities conference as a series of negotiating sessions in which individual nations make offers of troops, shortfalls are identified and member states are then \"required\" to remedy the shortfall. Each country's proposed contribution would then be collectively agreed. The Helsinki summit in December agreed to set up a corps, or 15 brigades, by June 2003 capable of carrying out a range of tasks, including peace enforcement. Ministers are aware that the Conservatives in the run-up to next year's likely general election will represent the plan as a commitment to a full-time standing Euro army, which will in the long term undermine Nato and decouple the US from Europe. Most EU capitals accept that they were acutely embarrassed by their reliance on the the US for the Nato-led operation in Kosovo.",

      "bodyText": "The number of people convicted for cannabis possession has more than doubled in the past six years to over 40,000 a year, according to new Home Office figures which deal a bodyblow to the idea that the police are taking a more lenient approach to soft drugs. This evidence of the increasingly tough enforcement of the drug laws in Britain coincides with a decision by the country's chief constables to start introducing drug testing for police officers for alcohol and illegal substances. New guidelines will recommend drug testing initially for new recruits and then for those in specialist squads such as firearms units. Although primarily designed as a welfare policy, those who fail to take the tests or test positive for illegal drugs will face disciplinary action. The Home Office figures published yesterday confirm conventional wisdom that there has been a sharp rise in the number of occasions that the police let off with a caution somebody found in possession of cannabis. But they explode the myth that this has been accompanied by a rapid decline in criminal prosecution for cannabis possession. The number of people con victed for cannabis possession rose in England and Wales from 26,600 in 1996 to 40,199 in 1998. During the same period the numbers of people arrested for cannabis possession and released with a caution rose from 38,000 to 48,000. Drugs law reform campaigners last night were dismayed by the official figures. The influential Police Foundation report published last month called for the depenalisation of cannabis possession so that prosecution in the courts would become the exception rather than the rule. Figures giving a breakdown for 1998 show that more than 60% of those arrested for all drug offences in Gloucestershire and Cleveland were released with a caution, compared with fewer than 30% of those arrested for the same offence in West Yorkshire, Thames Valley and Durham. On Merseyside and in the Thames Valley drug offenders were much more likely to be convicted and fined. In Durham, 25% of convicted drug offenders are sent to prison, in South Yorkshire 15% and in Humberside 14%. Jail is least likely to be the outcome for cannabis smokers arrested in Surrey (4%) and Gloucestershire (3%). In London, where the bulk of drug offenders are arrested, 61% are cautioned, 22% fined and 5% imprisoned. A Home Office spokesman said it was difficult to explain the sharp increase in both convictions and cautioning by the police for cannabis possession in the last two years but that it could reflect a growth in the numbers using cannabis or a tougher enforcement regime. Drug law reform campaigners put the blame on police guidelines, issued three years ago, designed to reduce the amount of repeat cautioning of offenders. Danny Kushlick of the drugs campaign Transform said: \"These figures show that decriminalisation is as far away as ever.\"",

      "body": "<p>Terror, a fireball like a nuclear explosion and bodies littering the streets of Lockerbie were described yesterday on the second day of the trial of two Libyan men accused of the bombing.</p> <p>Witnesses to the December 1988 disaster told the Scottish court at Camp Zeist in the Netherlands of a screeching roar before a firebomb lit up the sky and burning debris rained down. Within minutes, they were stepping over parts of the stricken plane and trying to cover up corpses on the ground.</p> <p>\"It looked like an atomic bomb,\" said Ian Wood, 37, from Lockerbie, recalling the fierce heat and blast as part of the aircraft exploded, sending a ball of fire high into the night sky.</p> <p>Much of the horror came through the very ordinariness of the events that were interrupted as the Jumbo came down. Many witnesses said they had been watching This is Your Life on television moments before the disaster.</p> <p>Jasmine Bell, a social worker, said she had been delivering Christmas food parcels to the Borders town at around 7pm when she first heard the noise of the falling plane. Mrs Bell, 53, shaking as she gave evidence, said her brother shouted: \"It's a plane, get down.\" She looked up and, at about roof height, a piece of shiny grey metal debris she thought was a small plane hurtled past. Almost immediately, pockets of fire began to break out in front of her and she backed away toward her brother's home.</p> <p>\"I ducked down and my brother had dived into the garage. Within seconds there was fire just raining down. It's the only way I can describe it.</p> <p>\"There was fire all around me, there were burning objects and the fire was falling down from the sky and as it landed on the ground I was stepping backwards to avoid the fire. I stepped back and back until my back was against the wall of the house and I couldn't go any further.</p> <p>\"The fire was still coming down and I thought I was going to be burned.\"</p> <p>Outside, a couple carrying two small children were looking for help and Mrs Bell, accompanied by her teenage son, went to their aid. \"My son looked down and said, 'What is that mum?' and my first reaction was it's OK it's just meat, and then I registered it wasn't meat,\" she said.</p> <p>\"Everything was burning - the driveway, the lawn, the hedges, the rooftops.\"</p> <p>She said she and her brother went into the street and had to jump over small \"campfires\" everywhere.</p> <p>Many houses were on fire and they went along the street to help people and get them out of their burning homes.</p> <p>Later she stumbled over an object that she later realised was part of a human body. \"I recalled seeing in my brother's garden and he had put white cloths around. There were parts of bodies and he had covered them.\"</p> <p>Roland Stevenson, a retired engineer from Dumfries, described the \"thunderous black mass\" that fell from the sky. He said he had shouted to people to run for cover as debris from the aircraft - including an entire wing - rained down. It started as the noise of thunder, he said, then developed into an orange fireball hurtling towards Sherwood Crescent.</p> <p>Mr Stevenson, 65, said he was at the town's railway station to meet his daughter. He waited in his car listening to the radio. Her train had arrived. Then he heard a noise. \"My first thought was that the train was over-revving its engines. It got progressively louder and became thunderous. I got out of the car.</p> <p>\"I saw an object coming from the north. It was a black mass showing some form of lights. A small flame. Enough for me to see the dark shape and the passage of the object. It was coming down on what I would call a glide path, at a shallow angle.\"</p> <p>Then he told of seeing an entire wing, without engines, plummeting from the sky. \"The whole of the wing was descending vertically straight down. I could see it wing tip to wing tip, a clean wing, silhouetted against the clouds from the town lights. A rolling ball of fire was descending rapidly from the sky.</p> <p>\"In the ball of flame I could see objects descending, black objects hurtling down towards the Sherwood Crescent end of the town. After the wing had crashed down I saw a door panel which came shimmering down in the night sky, silver, very clearly visible.\"</p> <p>There were other objects too, said Mr Stevenson. \"They were possibly seat sections. They were coming down very rapidly.\"</p> <p>As objects rained down his daughter emerged from the station. \"I told her to get back under cover. People came out of the nearby public house. I shouted to them to get under cover because there were objects falling from the sky.\"</p> <p>Kevin Anderson, 35, a plasterer from Tundergarth, three miles from Lockerbie, told the court how the plane's cockpit came down in the field opposite his house. He thought the explosion was \"atomic, like you see on the telly\".</p> <p>But the reality of the situation struck Mr Anderson immediately when he noticed, among the chaos, that what appeared to be the nose of a plane, decapitated from the fuselage, had landed around 100 yards from his house. Mr Anderson said he took a torch and went to investigate - and had his worst fears confirmed.</p> <p>\"I looked inside the cockpit with the torch,\" he said. \"There were bodies lying around the cockpit. I went to get my father-in-law from his house about 100 yards up the road. We went over to the cockpit to see if anyone was alive. I had a torch. We looked inside the cockpit. I could see the pilot.\"</p> <p>Stewart Kirkpatrick, who found the body of a young woman a few feet from his front doorstep, said he had suffered from alopecia and psychological problems since the accident. He said it had taken years for normal life to return to Lockerbie. \"I do my best just not think about it,\" he told the court.</p> <p>He described how he rescued an elderly neighbour whose house had been almost destroyed by debris from the plane.</p> <p>He and his family were in their home in Rosebank Crescent when they heard a loud noise and went outside to see a \"great big fireball\" shooting up into the air. Mr Kirkpatrick told the court he heard screaming from Ella Ramsden's house and dashed to the scene.</p> <p>Wreckage had landed right on top of the house, destroying everything but her kitchen - the room Mrs Ramsden, 70, happened to be in.</p> <p>Mr Kirkpatrick said: \"The rest had all fallen down and rubble was up to the height of her windowsill. I broke the kitchen window but she wouldn't come out without her dog so I lifted it out though the window and handed it to someone. Then I lifted her out.\"</p> <p>He told how he later saw Mrs Ramsden's house on the television news. \"It was quite hard to believe she was in the kitchen, the only place that was whole. She was a very lucky lady.\"</p> <p>Robert Peacock, 63, heard a thunderous noise and watched the plane spewing burning fuel from his home at Hightay, six miles away. Asked where it was heading, he replied: \"Straight for Lockerbie.\"</p> <p>All 259 passengers and crew on the flight died instantly. Eleven residents of the town were also killed. Two Libyans, Abdel Baset al-Megrahi and Al-Amin Khalifah Fhimah, deny charges of murder, conspiracy to murder and breaching the Aviation Security Act.</p> <p>By the second day of the trial, expected to last for over a year, there was already a feeling of routine at Camp Zeist, a former US airbase declared Scottish territory for the duration.

      "bodyText": "Knutsford shares were suspended yesterday after the high-profile bid vehicle announced it was in talks to buy a privately owned investor relations business partly owned by one of its own directors. The company said it was negotiating to buy World Investor Link (WIL), a US-based business which specialises in providing investors, free of charge, with the annual reports of public companies. The deal is expected to value WIL at around \u00a360m and the shares are likely to remain sus pended until completion of the purchase. Knutsford director Nigel Wray owns around 6% of WIL, with an option to take his holding to 11%. The deal is likely to be financed through a mixture of cash and new shares, and Mr Wray is expected to use Knutsford shares for his stake. Mr Wray, along with former Asda boss Archie Norman, property entrepreneur Nick Leslau and Richer Sounds millionaire Julian Richer bought into Knutsford last year amid a rush of publicity, saying they were going to use it as a vehi cle for buying an undervalued retailer. The shares, which were then valued at less than 10p, jumped to 250p. But the promotion of Mr Norman - who is also a Conservative MP - to the shadow cabinet and an aborted bid to buy conglomerate-cum-venture capital group Wassall forced Knutsford to switch its focus to e-commerce. WIL has a database of 1.2m customers, and Knutsford is likely to look to exploit them by offering online information on flotations and other, similar opportunities. Its existing customers include the Financial Times, the Wall Street Journal and the Investors Chronicle. The shares were down 1p at 80p when they were suspended. WIL also owns a small stake in Stockcube, the financial forecasting specialist planning a flotation and run by a team which includes Mr Wray and Tim Horlick, husband of \"superwoman\" Nicola. The flotation, scheduled for next month on the Alternative Investment Market at 25p a share, will value Stockcube at \u00a324m and raise \u00a33m for expansion and development.",

If a plumber talks about a \"washer\", instead of a funny little round rubber thingy that fits inside a tap, we don't accuse him of mangling the language. But education questions is something quite different. Here is a world in which few of the words used resemble the vocabulary of any normal person. There are \"new job retention pilots\", \"sure start programmes\", \"age diversity codes\", \"better regulation taskforces\" and endless \"roll-outs\". At education questions, no one ever says, \"we need more trained workers\". Instead, they say \"we must address the skills gap\". (\"Dear skills gap, may I make so bold.\") No minister could bear to say, \"we're doing three things to tackle this\"; instead they announce, as someone did yesterday, a \"three-pronged integrated strategy\". Nobody challenges this because anyone who is interested enough to turn up to the Commons on local government election day knows exactly what it means. So when David Blunkett says: \"All teachers at point 9 will be able to access the \u00a32,000 uplift, and access the fast-track procedure to be able to access these new thresholds,\" they all nod wisely, or else claim to be enraged - not by the minister's language but by what they surmise he might be trying to say. Jargon is like Lego: start fixing it together and you soon have something sturdily built but quite impossible to recognise. Estelle Morris was answering a question about the standard spending assess ment for primary school pupils. \"We are doing our best within the freeze on the SSA's,\" said Ms Morris, adding moments later, \"on top of which we can build fair, transparent extra money.\" I think this means something like: \"We will find a way of giving more money in an equal sort of way, while letting people know how we decide.\" But who can say? They love to borrow jargon from modern management-speak, and have a special love for buzzy words such as \"delivery\", \"best practice\" and \"excellence\". So Tessa Jowell announced, \"we are putting in place the job search programmes which have already had considerable success at the pilot stage, offering practical help, and are delivering people into the jobs which are there,\" making people sound like so many sacks of coal being delivered down a chute. There was one curious and somewhat disturbing incident.

Liberals always had the upper hand, said one spokesman and this list followed: the judiciary, senior police officers, town halls, social services, academia, education, \"Whitehall, obviously\" and definitely the media, not just broadcasting, \"BBC of course\" but they even control the print. What paranoia! Murdoch owns 41% of all print readership, with Conrad Black and Lord Rothermere in charge of most of the rest.</p> <p>Looking for a cooler head, I asked Two-Brains David Willetts, Tory thinker, where this liberal establishment still lurks. He added the church to the list - the Church of England, the \"nationalised\" church, he called it, not the evangelicals who are definitely not liberal. He named the cadre of quango-serving business men. At the BBC, he named Jeremy Paxman and Melvyn Bragg. It's pervasive, he said, and quoted a Radio 4 programme yesterday on gay families, accusing it of promoting gay parenthood as normal. As for academia, he accused social researchers of following a liberal agenda and liberal historians - Linda Colley in particular - of undermining traditional self-images of what it is to be British.</p> <p>So what qualifies someone as a liberal? He pulled out his copy of Edmund Burke who wrote: \"Many of our [conservative] men of speculation instead of exploding general prejudices employ their sagacity to discover the latent wisdom which prevails in them. If they find what they seek, and they seldom fail, they think it is more wise to continue the prejudice with the reason involved than to cast away prejudice and leave nothing but naked reason.\" So conservatives find latent wisdom in old prejudices while liberals seek truth by naked reason. What liberal would want to disagree? Maybe that explains William Hague's recent attempts to stoke up prejudice wherever he can against asylum seekers, Gypsies and fellow Europeans, while hymning the praises of gun-toting home owners.</p> <p>But paranoia apart, where is this liberal establishment? Does it exist? Whatever the virtues and successes of this government, it would be hard to call it liberal. Labour has always been riven between its liberal and illiberal instincts. In the past, its illiberal wing wore the workerist cloth cap of reactionary, chapel-bred sexual puritanism. It was full of little England patriotism, little-woman-in-the-home sexism and law-and-order authoritarianism. Labour's backbone had few liberal bones in its body. (Look at how the old Labour peers, including Callaghan, voted against lowering the gay age of consent.) But they tolerated the liberals in the party and allowed them to campaign against hanging and censorship and for abortion, gay rights and race-relations laws.</p> <p>New Labour is forged from neither of these traditions. Its trade-union roots are all but dead along with that old-fashioned conservatism, but the party's old liberalism has also been silenced for now. They have had to satisfy themselves with Labour's determined assault on poverty and heavy commitment to progressive social programmes instead. Jack Straw in riot gear stands ready to chase off anything from within too overtly liberal. In the fight to make Labour electable, he has been the bulwark defending the party's weak liberal flank. No one outflanks him on law and order, no one sticks a liberal label on his back.</p> <p>So far it has driven the Tories to distraction. For as long as Straw stands there, no epithets like soft-on-crime, soft-on-cannabis, giving-away-national-secrets or betraying-our-boys-in-blue ever sticks to this government. Teflon on law and order, shockproof on official secrets, strong as on ox on defence, rock steady on income tax, tough on rioters, ferocious to asylum seekers; none of the usual Tory assaults make any headway against New Labour.

Others say Labour couldn't have been elected without it. What's still unknown is whether beneath the carapace of Tony Blair and even Jack Straw there beats a more liberal instinct than they yet dare show. And if so, will they ever dare?</p> <p>Most MPs and ministers you meet are by nature - and in off-the-record opinion - far more liberal than the party's public face. Private response to the sensible Police Foundation report on decriminalising cannabis was almost wholly favourable.

In his book Our Age, he recorded from the inside how the postwar liberal consensus, Butskellism, embraced a bien-pensant trust in progress, reform and, yes, the power of naked reason. Mighty royal commissions of the great and good deliberated and their deliberations were acted upon. Roy Jenkins was the quintessential liberal Home Secretary who saw in the major 60s reforms. But that world imploded in the chaos of the last days of Labour. What remained was blow-torched out of existence by Margaret Thatcher.

That would boost Mr Trimble with his sceptical Ulster Unionist Council in selling a return to devolution with Sinn Fein without prior IRA decommissioning. Mr McGimpsey, whose brother Michael was an Ulster Unionist minister in the short-lived power-sharing executive, said: \"It gives some indication of the extremely green and intransigent position the Irish government is taking. \"There is obviously not a fraction of an inch difference between the Irish government and Sinn Fein.\" Disagreements between the governments have been bubbling under since Mr Mandelson signalled a return to direct rule on February 11.

Friends, the third largest mutual after Standard and Equitable Life, will be sending out nearly as many saying that the game is up for mutuality. Few people will need convincing that jam now - especially \u00a35,000 worth - is better than a potentially higher policy payout in many years' time. If they feel any discomfort about voting for carpetbaggers, they now know they are voting with the approval of the Friends board. </p> <p>Spirits will also be sinking at Equitable Life. It, too, has been battered by action groups angry about what they see as a refusal to pay out on annuity promises. If Equitable loses its appeal in the House of Lords in June, the writing may also be on the wall for the number two mutual. </p> <p>There are lots of reasons to support mutuality. But the windfall driven steamroller is now so powerful that almost nobody can stand in its way. Mutuality supporters must feel like the Scottish undertaker in Dad's Army. \"We're all doomed.\" </p> <p><strong> Brewer's angst </strong><br> </p> <p> What is the point of Whitbread? The company has been suffering existential angst for some time and is yet to come up with a satisfactory answer. </p> <p>The conglomerate's sprawling leisure businesses include Pizza Hut, Mariott Hotels, David Lloyd Leisure and Boddingtons. These are well known brands, but the group as a whole has underachieved. Perceptions have hardened that it is drifting aimlessly, tossed around at the whim of changing consumer habits. </p> <p>Chief executive David Thomas declared yesterday that he was outlining his \"strategy\". The general reaction afterwards was that if you blinked, you missed it. In a nutshell, Mr Thomas's plan is to \"operate in big, expanding markets\". He claims Whitbread's unique skill is that it \"understands the UK consumer at leisure\". This takes in everything from operating a tennis court to building a chain of coffee bars and running a local pub. </p> <p>The City wants more focus. Investors are frustrated with a mixed bag of figures from Whitbread each year, with the performance dragged down by whichever bit of the leisure market happens to be faring badly. </p> <p>This year, the laggards were soft drinks and restaurants, and management is slowly lumbering around to tackle these areas. Mr Thomas has also indicated that the group's breweries are up for sale - a course of action which the City called for well over a year ago. </p> <p>All this serves to support the view that Whitbread tends to plod along, reacting to trends as they materialise. Losing a bid battle with tiny rival Punch Taverns last year should have been a wake-up call. Instead Whitbread has lapsed back into denial, with Mr Thomas blaming the popularity of dot.coms for a halving of its share price in a year. </p> <p>He will have to come up with something better than that. </p> <p><strong> Real Knutsford </strong><br> </p> <p> The \u00a315bn takeover of Marks &amp; Spencer proved to be a fantasy; the \u00a3600m try-on with Wassall was thrown out by the institutions. But the investors who thought the foursome behind Knutsford were worth \u00a31bn without a business to run have finally got a deal. </p> <p>This one, to buy investor relations business World Investor Link, should not get away - if only because Knutsford director Nigel Wray already owns around 6% of WIL. What is more, the synergy of this acquisition is clear: WIL has a ready-made job explaining to Knutsford shareholders how stupid they have been to buy the stock.</p>",

If Equitable loses its appeal in the House of Lords in June, the writing may also be on the wall for the number two mutual. There are lots of reasons to support mutuality. But the windfall driven steamroller is now so powerful that almost nobody can stand in its way. Mutuality supporters must feel like the Scottish undertaker in Dad's Army. \"We're all doomed.\" Brewer's angst What is the point of Whitbread? The company has been suffering existential angst for some time and is yet to come up with a satisfactory answer. The conglomerate's sprawling leisure businesses include Pizza Hut, Mariott Hotels, David Lloyd Leisure and Boddingtons. These are well known brands, but the group as a whole has underachieved. Perceptions have hardened that it is drifting aimlessly, tossed around at the whim of changing consumer habits. Chief executive David Thomas declared yesterday that he was outlining his \"strategy\". The general reaction afterwards was that if you blinked, you missed it. In a nutshell, Mr Thomas's plan is to \"operate in big, expanding markets\". He claims Whitbread's unique skill is that it \"understands the UK consumer at leisure\". This takes in everything from operating a tennis court to building a chain of coffee bars and running a local pub. The City wants more focus. Investors are frustrated with a mixed bag of figures from Whitbread each year, with the performance dragged down by whichever bit of the leisure market happens to be faring badly. This year, the laggards were soft drinks and restaurants, and management is slowly lumbering around to tackle these areas. Mr Thomas has also indicated that the group's breweries are up for sale - a course of action which the City called for well over a year ago. All this serves to support the view that Whitbread tends to plod along, reacting to trends as they materialise. Losing a bid battle with tiny rival Punch Taverns last year should have been a wake-up call. Instead Whitbread has lapsed back into denial, with Mr Thomas blaming the popularity of dot.coms for a halving of its share price in a year. He will have to come up with something better than that. Real Knutsford The \u00a315bn takeover of Marks &amp; Spencer proved to be a fantasy; the \u00a3600m try-on with Wassall was thrown out by the institutions. But the investors who thought the foursome behind Knutsford were worth \u00a31bn without a business to run have finally got a deal. This one, to buy investor relations business World Investor Link, should not get away - if only because Knutsford director Nigel Wray already owns around 6% of WIL. What is more, the synergy of this acquisition is clear: WIL has a ready-made job explaining to Knutsford shareholders how stupid they have been to buy the stock.",

A Unigate spokeswoman pointed out that bids for the business had doubled since Dairy Crest made an initial offer in February. \"This is very good news for our shareholders.\" Industry sources suggest that a victory for Dairy Crest would mean more job cuts because there would be more overlap between operations in the south.

Up to 70 prison officers in riot gear were needed to restore order at Portland in Dorset after a wing was occupied on Wednesday night. It is believed the protest was started by inmates angry that they had been repeatedly denied free time out of their cells. Portland, a former borstal, has been at the centre of allegations that warders assaulted inmates. The prison service said that 26 inmates aged 15-21 were involved in the disturbances. They had erected barricades of furniture to keep officers at bay for eight hours. The stand-off, which caused minor damage, ended after the barricades were stormed by a squad of officers in riot gear. No one was injured. In March Sir David Ramsbotham, the chief inspector of prisons, branded as \"wholly unacceptable\" the treatment of young offenders at Portland and described conditions as a \"moral outrage\". Last night the prison service admitted that six times in the past month free time out of cells - called association - had been cancelled because of staff shortages caused by sickness. The youths were also believed to be angered by delays in responding to their grievances. The trouble started at 8.15pm on Wednesday after youths refused to return to their cells after association. Prison service negotiators tried to talk the inmates into ending their protest, but after negotiations failed riot officers went in. Warders from Winchester and Dorchester prisons were drafted in and at 4am broke through the barricades. A prison service spokesman said that an internal investigation was under way into the causes of the disturbances: \"There is no evidence of staff assaulting inmates.\" The spokesman added that a number of inmates had been moved out of the jail after the disturbances. \"A number of prisoners refused to go back to their cells.

It must indicate that there are serious issues.\" Frances Crook, of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said: \"Any inquiry should have an independent element to discover if there were legitimate issues being raised by the young offenders.\" She added: \"That independent element should either be the inspector of prisons or someone else from outside.\" More than 120 MPs have signed an early day motion calling for a judicial inquiry into the allegations of abuse since last year.",

Instead, Rettig, who produced a historic report into Chile's civilian dead during General Pinochet's rule, died of natural causes in Santiago, a few days short of his 91st birthday.</p> <p>Although denied a violent end, Rettig had often flirted with danger; he fought a celebrated duel with Salvador Allende, and risked the wrath of his country's armed forces, first, when investigating human rights abuses, and, more recently, when he questioned Pinochet's version of history after the former dictator was arrested in London.</p> <p>Rettig was born in the southern city of Temuco, admirably described in the memoirs of another famous Chilean born there in the early years of this century, Pablo Neruda. This shared origin helped the two men become firm friends, despite their political differences. While Neruda was a communist, who stood down in favour of Allende's presidential bid, Rettig had trained as a teacher and lawyer, and joined the Chilean centrist Radical party in his youth.</p> <p>The party shared in various coalition governments in the late 1930s and 1940s, and Rettig was deputy interior and deputy foreign minister in successive administrations. He also became party chairman and, in 1949, was elected as a senator.</p> <p>A powerful orator, his style was often more combative than his beliefs. In 1952, this led him into a heated argument with the then Socialist party senator Allende.

      "bodyText": "Faced with old age, illness and declining powers as he entered his ninth decade, the controversial Chilean politician and lawyer Ra\u00fal Rettig had a strange, but perhaps understandable, wish: \"Please, let someone assassinate me.\" It was a tribute to the esteem in which he was held in Chilean society that no one carried out his request. Instead, Rettig, who produced a historic report into Chile's civilian dead during General Pinochet's rule, died of natural causes in Santiago, a few days short of his 91st birthday. Although denied a violent end, Rettig had often flirted with danger; he fought a celebrated duel with Salvador Allende, and risked the wrath of his country's armed forces, first, when investigating human rights abuses, and, more recently, when he questioned Pinochet's version of history after the former dictator was arrested in London. Rettig was born in the southern city of Temuco, admirably described in the memoirs of another famous Chilean born there in the early years of this century, Pablo Neruda. This shared origin helped the two men become firm friends, despite their political differences. While Neruda was a communist, who stood down in favour of Allende's presidential bid, Rettig had trained as a teacher and lawyer, and joined the Chilean centrist Radical party in his youth. The party shared in various coalition governments in the late 1930s and 1940s, and Rettig was deputy interior and deputy foreign minister in successive administrations. He also became party chairman and, in 1949, was elected as a senator. A powerful orator, his style was often more combative than his beliefs. In 1952, this led him into a heated argument with the then Socialist party senator Allende. Matters got so out of hand that Rettig challenged Allende to a duel, which was duly set for six o'clock the next morning. Both men turned up with their seconds, and both fired their guns, but, as in the best tradition, both aimed to miss. The Radical party was over taken in popularity in the 1950s and 1960s by more outspoken parties, including the communists and Allende's socialists. Rettig and the Radicals did, however, support the Allende-led Popular Unity government in 1970, and as a reward for his services, Rettig was appointed ambassador to Brazil, serving there until 1973. When Pinochet led the military coup in Chile in 1973, Rettig was forced back into private life, and he took up his legal practice again. In 1985, he was elected as president of the prestigious Colegio de Abogados (or lawyers' association), where he struggled to maintain the independence of the profession despite the difficulties of military rule. In 1990, after Pinochet had given way to civilian government in Chile, the new president, Patricio Aylwin, asked Rettig to head an eight-strong team investigating the accusations of murder, torture and disappearance that had arisen during the country's 17 years of military rule. Collecting the evidence took Rettig and his colleagues a full year. In March 1991, he presented the six volumes of the finished report - which immediately became known as the Rettig report - to an emotional president. Such was the solidity of the evidence that, on receiving it, Aylwin apologised to all Chileans for the crimes committed against them by the state. It had been hoped that the report would serve as the basis for trials against the perpetrators of human rights crimes, but the Chilean supreme court, still dominated by nominees loyal to Pinochet, blocked the move. The truth the report set out to uncover thus never reached the Chilean courts. This was, in part, what made Pinochet's arrest in London at the end of 1998 so important.

      "bodyText": "A computer virus which exploits office workers' yearnings for love shut down computer systems from Hong Kong to the Houses of Parliament yesterday and caused untold millions of pounds worth of delays and damage to stored files across the world. The virus, nicknamed \"the love bug\" and \"the killer from Manila\" after its apparent Philippine origins, is carried in an email with the heading \"ILOVEYOU\". The text of the message reads: \"Kindly check the attached love letter from me!\" A click on the attached file launches the virus, which promptly spreads by sending itself to everyone in the recipient's email address book, overloading email systems. Once embedded in a host computer, the virus can download more dangerous software from a remote website, rename files and redirect internet browsers. \"It's a very effective virus. It's one of the most aggressive and nastiest I've ever seen,\" said Kieran Fitzsimmons of MessageLabs, which screens millions of company emails for viruses. \"It manifests itself almost everywhere in the computer.\" One tenth of the world's mail servers were down as a result of the love bug, he said. Estimates suggested that between 10% and 30% of UK businesses were hit. Among the firms and organisations affected in the UK yesterday were Microsoft, News International - publishers of the Times and the Sun - the BBC, a number of FTSE-100 companies and parliament. In an announcement to the Commons, Margaret Beckett, leader of the House, said that the parliamentary email system had crashed. \"I have to tell you that, sadly, this affectionate greeting contains a virus which has immobilised the house's internal communication system,\" she said. At the UK arm of Reed International, publisher of trade magazines, IT engineers alerted staff with Tannoy announcements after the bug had already crippled their computer system. \"It completely wipes out your network,\" said Sarah Perkins of PC Pro magazine. \"Ours is down and we're going to lose a day's business.\" The virus spread west from Asia as offices opened and workers checked their emails.

      "body": "<p>News that Telewest is talking to magazine publisher IPC about a possible acquisition brings heaps of exciting new television opportunities to mind. </p> <p>IPC is one of the country's biggest publishers of consumer magazines. It houses the likes of Loaded, Marie Claire, Woman's Own and the list-tastic TV Times. Cable company Telewest is in the process of merging with TV company Flextech which owns the Bravo, Trouble and UK Gold/Drama/Horizons/Style channels. It has its sights set on convergent media. What does this mean? Only that you'll be able to access the same media content on your mobile phone and PC as on your TV. Yippee! </p> <p>A deal with IPC would, of course, give the Telewest/Flextech behemoth (they're looking for another name, not surprisingly) a great deal more lovely content to relay to us punters over the various media. Just think of that regular \"poor but 'appy\" story every month in Marie Claire - you know, the worthy feature at the front about (this month) \"Cuban revolutionaries to child conscripts of Liberia - these brave female fighters\". Now that would look great in all singing and dancing colour on your mobile or personal digital assistant. Wouldn't it? And what scope for the monthly Come Again - The Facts Of Life slot from Loaded? I can see that working as a regular email bulletin, brightening every dull day at the orifice. </p> <p>Of course, TV Times offers perhaps the most possibilities. Imagine a world where you could skip from an audio-enhanced version of Donna Hay advising Zak to send Nellie packing (from the sets of Emmerdale) relayed over your hands-free phone to a Videoplus programme allowing you to record that night's episode via your TV Times software on your work PC. The only problem might be your boss, left wondering if you ever do any work at all.

      "bodyText": "News that Telewest is talking to magazine publisher IPC about a possible acquisition brings heaps of exciting new television opportunities to mind. IPC is one of the country's biggest publishers of consumer magazines. It houses the likes of Loaded, Marie Claire, Woman's Own and the list-tastic TV Times. Cable company Telewest is in the process of merging with TV company Flextech which owns the Bravo, Trouble and UK Gold/Drama/Horizons/Style channels. It has its sights set on convergent media. What does this mean? Only that you'll be able to access the same media content on your mobile phone and PC as on your TV. Yippee! A deal with IPC would, of course, give the Telewest/Flextech behemoth (they're looking for another name, not surprisingly) a great deal more lovely content to relay to us punters over the various media. Just think of that regular \"poor but 'appy\" story every month in Marie Claire - you know, the worthy feature at the front about (this month) \"Cuban revolutionaries to child conscripts of Liberia - these brave female fighters\". Now that would look great in all singing and dancing colour on your mobile or personal digital assistant. Wouldn't it? And what scope for the monthly Come Again - The Facts Of Life slot from Loaded? I can see that working as a regular email bulletin, brightening every dull day at the orifice. Of course, TV Times offers perhaps the most possibilities. Imagine a world where you could skip from an audio-enhanced version of Donna Hay advising Zak to send Nellie packing (from the sets of Emmerdale) relayed over your hands-free phone to a Videoplus programme allowing you to record that night's episode via your TV Times software on your work PC. The only problem might be your boss, left wondering if you ever do any work at all. Time, if ever there was one, to make good that ambition to work in the media, where you can claim all this interactivity is simply \"research\". Lucy Rouse is editor of Broadcast magazine",

      "body": "<p>The setting is lunch in a northern public school, circa 1968. One hundred boys in Foundation House - mostly the sons of landowners, industrialists, nuclear scientists and civil servants - have just queued for their weekly ration of marmalade, strawberry jam or lemon curd, supposed to last each one a week. Rule 423b, or perhaps just tradition, states that each of us must eat only his own food. But rebellion is brewing in the lower sixth. The conversation goes something like this: </p> <p>Boy A: \"This is stupid. Why don't we just pool everything? You can share mine, I can share yours. That way, we'll all have a choice.\" </p> <p>Boy B: \"But that's... that's communism.\" </p> <p>Boy C: \"Well it makes sense...\" </p> <p>Boy D: \"Think where this could end...\" </p> <p>Boy A: \"Exactly.\" </p> <p>And so began the Battle of the Jams, a miniature revolution which was at first brutally repressed and eventually accepted by an ancient school that prided itself on physical prowess and arcane privileges, boasting more by-laws and rules than any government could conceive. </p> <p>The revolution spread fast, from table to table and then house to house. The prefects, sensing correctly a threat to their power and an overthrow of the state, tried to stamp it out, picking on the weakest with punishment runs, and then on the ringleaders by cancelling privileges. </p> <p>But they only drove the revolution underground. The housemaster publicly condemned the sharing of private goods - \"the property of the school\" - as subversive, a word few of us had ever heard before. Two of us - wrongly identified, as it happened - were thrashed, but within weeks, the ancient system of one man, one jam had crumbled. </p> <p>And there it might have ended, if the jam wars had not coincided with a talk to the school given by one of the founders of Amnesty International, the French student revolt and intense classroom discussions about Sartre and existentialism. The combination of personal experience of repression, a growing awareness of human rights, and a philosophical system to bat our own ideas off was powerful stuff. </p> <p>Within a year, the whole school system was being rejected. Why, we asked, should prefects be allowed to beat young boys? Why should they have fags - effectively, slaves - to cook, clean, iron and run errands for them? Why should we look at our feet when passing a senior boy, or wear shorts until the age of 18? </p> <p>Within two years, under a barrage of criticism led by the boys and then their parents, the school had changed, and much of the social repression had been abolished. How many of those boys are still social reformers or questioners of the establishment I do not know - but I suspect that the answer is quite a few. </p> <p>Public schools have always bred an anti-establishment view. No one is more qualified than a public schoolboy to recognise dictatorship, fascism, human rights abuse and inequality. If you separate bright children from their parents at a very young age, keep them in borstal-type conditions, and instil in them even a modicum of social awareness, you are bound to get not just a majority who toe the line, question nothing and further a class or economic system that only benefits them, but a smaller group who at some time in their lives will rebel intellectually, emotionally or physically. </p> <p>Matthew MacDonald is one of the rebels. The 17-year-old's time at Eton College came to an abrupt end on Wednesday night after he was arrested near Trafalgar Square amid the violence that erupted during Monday's anti-capitalism demonstrations. \"He submitted a letter saying that although he loves the school and very much appreciates the teaching, his political views don't allow him in conscience to continue at such a privileged institution,\" his father Theodore MacDonald, a professor at London's Brunel University, was quoted as saying. What Matthew did enjoy about Eton, an anonymous friend of his added, was that he could \"destroy the Establishment from within.\" </p> <p>MacDonald's arrest comes days after the acquittal of Lord Melchett (Eton, Cambridge), executive director of Greenpeace and GM crop trampler, and two weeks after the acquittal of Mark Brown (Radley, Goldsmith's College), 36-year-old grandson of the Dewhurst tycoon Sir Derek Vestey, who had been accused of helping to organise last November's City riots. Brown shares a trust fund valued at \u00a32.7m - a clear \u00a3700,000 more than the estimated cost of the damage caused by the riot. </p> <p>But the wilder shores of activism have always been tinged with bluer blood than might at first be supposed. The tradition of public school social reform is long, and the thread of money and privilege runs through almost every radical social movement Britain has known. Abolitionists, the first animal rights activists, many early campaigners for trade unionism, some of the first socialists, communists, suffrage campaigners and feminists, through to the human rights and anti-nuclear movements have all been led, or at least intellectually informed, by the sons and daughters of the rich. </p> <p>Today's environment movement is in this respect no different, attracting numerous representatives of the financially or socially privileged classes. As well as Melchett and Brown, its leading lights include a host of former public schoolboys and girls: Jonathon (Lord) Porritt, the heir to a baronetcy, Sir Crispin Tickell, George Monbiot, the tribe of Goldsmiths, Gordon Roddick, the Marchioness of Worcester (who proposed setting up an eco-village on the family estate); Julia Stephenson, novelist, anti-fur campaigner and Mark Brown's sister, several of the early Earth-Firsters and, of course, Prince Charles himself. All, at one time or another, have been vilified and ridiculed in the press and the green movement for the role they play. </p> <p>Their motives are complex. Some have reacted against the part their families have played in environmental destruction. Most understand that the environmental movement, if it is to succeed, must address the allied problems of poverty, development, capitalism and global injustice - and that they are therefore effectively fighting for the very people their families have so long ignored. </p> <p>\"Among the aristocrats there is a sense of stewardship, of noblesse oblige, of wanting to use your position for the general good,\" says Charles Secrett (Cranleigh), executive director of Friends of the Earth. \"There is also for some of them a sort of guilt - they are so lucky, have so much, that they need to give more. For the landed aristocracy, there is also a feeling of stewardship towards the land.\" Many public schools have had vibrant environment groups, often encouraged by masters; Matthew MacDonald had founded a school society in tribute to another radical old Etonian, George Orwell. The destruction of Twyford Down - widely accepted to have been the catalyst for much of the direct action in the past seven years - was most actively opposed by young Wykehamists, whose own school, Winchester College, played its part by selling the land for the bypass to the government. </p> <p>\"All movements are started by the middle classes, the ones who read the newspapers and who have the time to take part - even Communism,\" says Teddy Goldsmith, veteran environmental activist and first editor of the Ecologist magazine, a post now filled by his nephew Zac. \"But I've been in the environmental movement for 35 years and I have never seen anything like what is happening now: people from every walk of life, from all classes, are all joining together, because they see themselves as victims of the globalised economy, and they object to the fact that Mr Blair and Mr Clinton behave as if they are employees of a handful of global corporations.\" </p> <p>None the less - as Matthew MacDonald is discovering - the life of the privileged activist can be particularly prone to philosophical contradictions.

      "bodyText": "Hours after Ehud Barak's government confirmed it would test Star Wars laser defence system on its borders, Hizbullah guerrillas last night demonstrated the power of their rockets in a fiery assault on northern Israel. Israeli radio said at least six people were injured by some 40 Katyusha rockets, which fell on the northern town of Kiryat Shemona and border settlements for more than half an hour yesterday evening. Hizbullah said the attack was in retaliation for Israeli strikes on its self-declared security zone in south Lebanon. As darkness fell, thousands of people descended into underground bunkers in Kiryat Shemona and kibbutzes on the Lebanese border. Israel's security cabinet was to meet late last night to discuss its response, Israeli television said, a move likely to lead to heavy bombing of south Lebanon. Yesterday's attacks underscored the vulnerability of Israel's northern villages in advance of the planned troop withdrawal from Lebanon on July 7. US officials announced earlier this week that the powerful laser-based defence system being developed jointly by both countries had hit stationary targets. It is to be tested against a moving Katyusha later this month, and then shipped to Israel for further testing and deployment. The possible deployment of the laser represents a revival of the previously discredited Strategic Defence Initiative - or Star Wars - of the 1980s. However, Israeli defence experts say the technology is unlikely to be in place for two years - leaving the villages of northern Israeli exposed to Hizbullah assaults. Last night's attack was the deadliest assault on Israeli territory since last June. A spokesman for the Shi'ite Muslim militia said the attacks were in retaliation for the deaths of an 80-year-old Lebanese woman and her daughter, who were killed by Israeli artillery bombardment overnight on Wednesday.",

When she refused and threw a tantrum, her father put her across his knee, pulled down her trousers and knickers and smacked her.</p> <p>The incident was spotted by a member of staff, who reported it to the police, who charged the father.</p> <p>He was ordered to keep away from the family home over Christmas and was suspended from his \u00a320,000 post at a north Lanarkshire primary school.</p> <p>The man was admonished by the court and last autumn a children's panel hearing placed a year-long supervision order on all three children in the family. Since then, once a fortnight, social workers call at the house to check the children.</p> <p>The case prompted a national debate on smacking and caused uproar among some family campaigners who believe in the right to physically chastise children.</p> <p>In March the man was called to give evidence before a GTC disciplinary hearing. All teachers at state schools in Scotland must be registered with the council.</p> <p>Yesterday the man's lawyer, Joe Beltrami, said his client was deeply shocked by the ruling and would be appealing to the high court in Edinburgh.</p> <p>\"There are a number of grounds for appeal and I'm very confident indeed. He will see his employers and we'll see what happens then.\"</p> <p>Mr Beltrami said the 10-member GTC panel which heard the case did not give a reason for its decision.</p> <p>The teacher, who was accompanied to yesterday's hearing by his wife and all three of their children, has repeatedly said that he was wrong to smack his child.</p> <p>\"I just lost it and deeply regret it,\" he has said. \"What father hasn't smacked his kids then regretted it?\"</p> <p>Relatives of the family say the daughter is consumed with guilt at what has happened to her father. Since his suspension, the man has been working in a teaching resource library for his employers, North Lanarkshire council.</p> <p>The council said yesterday it would consider the GTC ruling. It was a condition of contract that every teacher should be registered with the teaching council.</p> <p>Tino Ferri, the NASUWT spokesman for Scotland, said: \"I don't know why they have chosen to marry the school and non-school matter.\"</p>",

      "bodyText": "A teacher convicted of assault for smacking his daughter is to be struck off the teachers' register by the General Teaching Council. The father of three from north Lanarkshire was ruled unfit to remain in the teaching profession by the GTC yesterday after a court convicted him of assaulting his daughter, aged 8, by smacking her bottom when she threw a tantrum in a dentist's waiting room. The man, aged 49, who cannot be named for legal reasons, had denied that smacking the girl's bare bottom up to six times with his hand constituted an assault. But he has admitted he lost his temper on Christmas Eve, 1998, at a Motherwell health centre where he had taken his daughter to have a tooth pulled. When she refused and threw a tantrum, her father put her across his knee, pulled down her trousers and knickers and smacked her. The incident was spotted by a member of staff, who reported it to the police, who charged the father. He was ordered to keep away from the family home over Christmas and was suspended from his \u00a320,000 post at a north Lanarkshire primary school. The man was admonished by the court and last autumn a children's panel hearing placed a year-long supervision order on all three children in the family. Since then, once a fortnight, social workers call at the house to check the children. The case prompted a national debate on smacking and caused uproar among some family campaigners who believe in the right to physically chastise children. In March the man was called to give evidence before a GTC disciplinary hearing. All teachers at state schools in Scotland must be registered with the council. Yesterday the man's lawyer, Joe Beltrami, said his client was deeply shocked by the ruling and would be appealing to the high court in Edinburgh. \"There are a number of grounds for appeal and I'm very confident indeed. He will see his employers and we'll see what happens then.\" Mr Beltrami said the 10-member GTC panel which heard the case did not give a reason for its decision. The teacher, who was accompanied to yesterday's hearing by his wife and all three of their children, has repeatedly said that he was wrong to smack his child. \"I just lost it and deeply regret it,\" he has said. \"What father hasn't smacked his kids then regretted it?\" Relatives of the family say the daughter is consumed with guilt at what has happened to her father. Since his suspension, the man has been working in a teaching resource library for his employers, North Lanarkshire council. The council said yesterday it would consider the GTC ruling. It was a condition of contract that every teacher should be registered with the teaching council. Tino Ferri, the NASUWT spokesman for Scotland, said: \"I don't know why they have chosen to marry the school and non-school matter.\"",

We were cut off from the other troops. We were exhausted and miserable,\" the captain said. As mortar shells continued to fall on the Sri Lankan government platoon, two of his soldiers were killed, and eight wounded.</p> <p>After only two hours' sleep, supported by a radio with a flat battery, and only biscuits left to eat, Capt Anussha decided to call it a day. As he fled across the jungle, a bullet hit him. \"I didn't know what had happened,\" he said. His fellow soldiers - those that had made it back from the battle at Pallai, which fell to the advancing rebels on Sunday - dumped him on a tractor.</p> <p>Yesterday, sitting in a military hospital in Colombo, Capt Anussha was pondering what went wrong. \"They have taken the most important tactical ground,\" he admitted, nursing his leg wound. \"They know the territory. They use it better.\"</p> <p>Across the Jaffna peninsula, Capt Anussha's story is being repeated. The army is retreating. Sri Lanka's government, headed by President Chandrika Kumaratunge, is in disarray, uncertain what to do. In a sign of desperation, the president yesterday introduced sweeping restrictions. She banned activities perceived as a threat to national security; brought in unlimited powers of arrest; invoked the right to close down troublesome newspapers. Foreign journalists must submit reports to a military censor. Criticism of the president has been banned.</p> <p>India, meanwhile, has refused to evacuate some 28,000 troops trapped in the town of Jaffna.</p> <p>After 17 years of brutal civil conflict in Sri Lanka, the war between the Tamil Tigers, who have been fighting for their own homeland, and government troops appears to be reaching a denouement. The Tigers are winning. A force of around 4,000 rebels - many of them women, some of them teenagers reared on a diet of Tiger propaganda and Rambo videos - is poised to defeat a well-equipped modern army of some 120,000 increasingly demoralised men.</p> <p>Two weeks ago the Tigers stormed a key military base at Elephant Pass, the crucial gateway to the Jaffna peninsula. They killed 79 soldiers and took a huge cache of ammunition. Over the weekend they continued towards the town of Jaffna, capturing the town of Pallai and shooting Capt Anussha in the leg. The Tigers are now within 23 miles of the town they controlled until 1995, and have vowed to recapture it at any cost.</p> <p>Although government troops held off an assault two days ago at the naval base of Kilaly, most analysts now believe it is only a matter of time before Jaffna falls. It could be days.</p> <p>After a two-day pause the Tigers are expected to renew their assault, by attempting to shell the runway at Palalai, the government's only functioning air base. They need to advance only three miles more before the airstrip comes into range of Tiger heavy artillery. If the airport is destroyed, the government has little choice but to evacuate.</p> <p>\"It is a hopeless military situation. In such a situation there is no choice but to withdraw,\" Iqbal Athas, Sri Lanka's most respected defence analyst, said yesterday.\"They can't hold it. The troops have been fighting for 11 days. They are exhausted.\" Others analysts demur, and suggest the Tigers face the prospect of massive casualties as they advance across increasingly flat terrain against an army which has nowhere to flee.</p> <p>Sitting in Colombo military hospital yesterday, surrounded by fellow officers in striped blue pyjamas, most of them with shattered limbs, Lieutenant Chaminda Pushpakumara described how many of his fellow soldiers died of dehydration in the retreat from Pallai. \"We were attacked for three days. The Tigers came in small groups. The first thing they did was capture three wells. Then after that we didn't have any water. We were near a lagoon but could not drink. It was very very hot. I think 50 people died, many from dehydration,\" he said. \"The Tigers are strong. They are using modern weapons,\" he added.</p> <p>The plight of the soldiers was made worse by the fact that they were ordered to flee through the jungle wearing heavy flak jackets. Senior army officials had expected the attack to come from the south of the peninsula. In fact, a seaborne division of rebels landed on the north, crossing a lagoon by canoe before capturing part of the main supply road between Jaffna and Elephant Pass. The manoeuvre left Lt Pushpakumara and his troops without supplies.</p> <p>The Tigers use of heavy artillery in recent months has proved devastating, military sources admit. Major Dhammika Wijesooriya, whose leg was almost blown off by a mortar on March 27, conceded the Tigers had a strategic advantage. \"We study the maps and after that go for an offensive. It is easier for them because they know the territory. They also use small children motivated to fight. It is incorrect,\" he said.</p> <p>The deepening crisis in the north has prompted Sri Lanka's government to seek help from outside, and to embark on a desperate quest for more heavy weaponry. Diplomatic relations were hastily resumed with Israel yesterday, a country which has supplied Sri Lanka with helicopter gunships. But crucial naval assistance from India has not been forthcoming.</p> <p>On Wednesday night India's foreign minister Jaswant Singh ruled out intervention in the conflict. Sri Lanka's foreign minister Lakshman Kadirgamar, who had flown to New Delhi to meet the prime minister, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, left empty-handed. India's refusal to intervene is hardly surprising. As part of a peace accord, India sent troops to disarm the Tamil Tiger rebels in 1987 but pulled out three years later after losing more than 1,000 soldiers. The episode led directly to the assassination of India's former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi, who was blown up by a Tamil suicide bomber in 1991.</p> <p>Mr Kadirgamar admitted on Wednesday that the Tigers were \"cock-a-hoop\" and in no mood to pursue peace talks being brokered by Norway since early this year.</p> <p>The defeats in the north have left Sri Lanka's majority Sinhalese population stunned, and have prompted a wave of national soul-searching. Blame is being heaped on the deputy minister of defence, Anuruddha Ratwatte.

The device will be available on prescription from today for women who suffer sexual arousal problems. While Viagra, the drug developed to help men who suffered from impotence, is now sold over the internet and has become a staple of the comedian's routine, sexual aids for women have not received the same public attention. The manufacturers of the device called Eros CTD (clitoral therapy device) believe that there is an equally large market awaiting their product. The Food and Drug Administration announced yesterday that it had approved Eros, made by UroMetrics, a small private company in St Paul, Minnesota. It will cost $359 (\u00a3230) and will only be available on prescription - not because it is deemed to be dangerous or to have risky side effects but because the FDA believes it should only be used with a doctor's advice. Eros is essentially a soft plastic cup that is placed over the clitoris and operated by a hand-held vacuum tube. It is similar in principle to vacuum pumps used by men to achieve erections in that it stimulates the blood flow into the genital area. Viagra is used by many women but there has as yet not been significant research on its effects on women. The National Institutes of Health estimate that about 40m American women suffer from \"female sexual dysfunction\". Testing of Eros by the FDA showed that 80% of those using it experienced increased sexual satisfaction. Tests are now due to be carried out in France, Norway and Italy. It is estimated that as many as 2m women will have been prescribed Eros within its first year of licensing in the US. \"This is not going to be a panacea,\" said Dr Diane Mitchell, the FDA gynaecologist responsible for the tests. \"It does not help every woman.\" It might not be effective for women whose sexual problems were of a psychological nature, she said.

      "bodyText": "A one-legged man goes to see a wizard and asks to be given two legs again. \"I can make many dreams come true but that's too difficult,\" says the wizard, \"so wish for something easier.\" \"I've got this friend, Frank Dobson,\" the man replies, \"can you make him mayor of London?\" \"Let's have another look at that leg.\" The joke, told against Frank Dobson by a member of his own campaign team, underlined how far his star waned during a disastrous eight-month bid to be mayor of London. The former health secretary started out a political heavyweight who enjoyed telling dirty stories. He ended a figure of fun, the butt of a thousand bad quips. Bookies stopped taking bets on the outcome of the race a fortnight ago and, though Dobson put on the brave face worn by all candidates, even his closest allies yesterday said he would not win. Recriminations started last night before the polls closed in the capital and the result was known. Inquests by Labour's national executive committee and the Greater London party could make the \"blame game\" one of the best free shows in town. The emergence in second place during the last opinion polls of the Tory Steve Norris added to Dobson's woes and left him needing a miracle. Downing Street is pointing the finger at Millbank and Dobson; Millbank is complaining about Dobson and No 10; Dobson feels let down by both. His supporters believe he was let down by the prime minister, with Tony Blair not appearing with him in public until early April - just four weeks before the polls. The Ken Livingstone supporters who branded Dobson a puppet of No 10 also accused him of lacking Downing Street support. He could not win. \"He was a lame duck from day one and his campaign never got past first base,\" said a Labour bankbencher. \"Frank,\" said a minister, \"was never given the support he needed and because they feared he would lose, prominent figures did not want to get too close.\" A Millbank official said: \"We did everything we could. He can have no complaints.\" Another said: \"This is a disaster made in Downing Street. Blair made a fundamental political error by creating a job without first deciding who would fill it.\" Sympathetic Westminster colleagues conceded that Dobson's campaign was poor and never really got going. Overtures After months of dismissing those who claimed he would stand as \"fancy nancys\" and in one case \"liars\", Dobson agreed 10 days before last September's Labour conference in Bournemouth to put his name forward. Downing Street had identified him as a favoured candidate as early as February 1998, nearly 20 months earlier, but he had resisted the overtures. His reluctance was to prove damaging twice over: valuable time was lost to erode Livingstone's huge poll lead and it looked as if he had been strong-armed into running, allowing rivals to paint him as No 10's stooge. Even when he decided to go for it, Dobson delayed again - opting not to announce his intentions until after the conference. Blair and Dobson did not want the London mayor issue to dominate the conference but they missed an opportunity to use it as a platform to launch his campaign. He had second thoughts midweek during the conference and considered using his speech as health secretary to make his plans clear but at the last minute pulled back, instead denying rumours he would stand.

Had the electoral college been imposed Raynsford would have quit. As it was he had three days of campaigning before Dobson finally threw his hat into the ring, forcing Raynsford to swiftly withdraw. Hollow But Livingstone's repeated opinion poll leads panicked Downing Street and Millbank as both feared Dobson could not win a one-member, one-vote ballot of the party's 68,000 London members even if it was delayed until the spring. An electoral college based on the discredited model used in Wales, including trade union block votes, was devised to stop Livingstone and deliver victory for Dobson. It was to be a hollow victory.

      "body": "<p>Yes, yes, yes, oh, YEEESSSS! He's IN! At long last, Kenneth Robert Livingstone - \"Ken\" to you and me and the vast majority of ordinary, decent people in this great city - has been duly elected mayor of London.</p> <p>Nope, this time the Tory and New Labour smear campaigns didn't pay off. The ordinary, decent Londoner - and, believe me, there's no-one more brilliantly canny than your average cockney - refused to be taken in by the smear machines. So let's nail these Six Great Smears for once and for all.</p> <p>Smear 1: We were told that Ken is on the far left and once supported the IRA. The Plain Truth: Ken is an extremist only in his commitment to the well being of the people of this great city. He rarely, if ever, thinks about \"politics\", and believes terrorism should be practised only when strictly necessary.</p> <p>Smear 2: We were told that Ken is a political opportunist, who will say whatever people want to hear in order to get elected. The Plain Truth: When I voiced these worries to Ken, he placed his hand gently on my shoulder, looked me straight in the eye and assured me personally that it wasn't true.</p> <p>Smear 3: We were told that, way back in the 1980s, Ken once had a moustache. The Plain Truth: Ken has always been clean-shaven. Photographs of him wearing a moustache have been circulating in the media for many years now, but these have been widely discredited by photographic experts as highly skilled M15 forgeries, many of them studio shots of Private Walker, the spiv character in the long-running TV series Dad's Army.</p> <p>Smear 4: We were told that Ken has never been liked by his parliamentary colleagues. The Plain Truth: Ken's popularity in the House of Commons is legendary. The reason they never want to sit anywhere near him is purely because they don't want to seem to be \"sucking up\" to such a charismatic political star.</p> <p>Smear 5: We were told that Ken will use the mayoralty to promote old political cronies. The Plain Truth: Ken has pledged to pick his colleagues from right across the political spectrum. He has already offered his fellow Labour candidates key posts, but Glenda Jackson refused a senior catering position while Frank Dobson snootily refused out of hand the prestigious post of deputy mayor with special responsibility for toilet facilities in underground car parks.</p> <p>Smear 6: We were told that London under Ken Livingstone's GLC wasn't all it has since been cracked up to be. The Plain Truth: Under Ken Livingstone, London in 1980s became a socialist paradise. Thanks to Ken's revolutionary Fares Fair policy. There were no traffic jams whatsoever, smoked salmon \"eats\" were served at peak hours on the underground, and the uncrowded streets were full of goodwill and merriment, neighbours sharing nutritious scraps with one another, while folk of all colours and creeds performed impromptu ballads in praise of their unmoustachioed liberator.</p> <p>But now let's look to the future. Those of us who have stuck with Ken through thick and thin are fully aware what kind of miracles the guy is capable of. By the end of May, for instance, he will have largely sorted out London's current traffic nightmare. Out will go the private cars with their noxious fumes and irate single-person drivers. In will come luxurious door-to-door buses and coaches, all expertly driven by cheerful cockneys, many of them bona fide pearly kings and queens, with a choice of soft drinks, plus delicious freshly made baguettes and a full range of tempting pastries all \"on the house\".</p> <p>Out will go tardy, grubby tube trains. In will come a fully integrated mixed-media underground transport system. Out will go the notorious Circle line, disastrously designed so that the traveller who gets on at, say South Kensington, emerges over an hour later in the very same place. In will come a vivid and hugely exciting new Sur Cool line redesigned by award-winning BritArtist Tracey Emin (widely tipped to be the new deputy mayor), which will transport jaded commuters on a magical mystery tour of light, colour and shade, eventually dropping them at West Acton, within easy reach of a handy connection for the District line.</p> <p>With the happy loss of so much road traffic, many of London's busiest highways will be grassed over and transformed into premium picnic areas, where ordinary, decent Londoners - the best home-cooks in the world, incidentally - will be only too pleased to share their hampers with the homeless and downtrodden.</p> <p>And those are just the plans until June! Hurrah for Ken! He's the guy who'll make us all happy once more! And one thing's for sure: he'll never disappoint us.</p>",

      "bodyText": "Yes, yes, yes, oh, YEEESSSS! He's IN! At long last, Kenneth Robert Livingstone - \"Ken\" to you and me and the vast majority of ordinary, decent people in this great city - has been duly elected mayor of London. Nope, this time the Tory and New Labour smear campaigns didn't pay off. The ordinary, decent Londoner - and, believe me, there's no-one more brilliantly canny than your average cockney - refused to be taken in by the smear machines. So let's nail these Six Great Smears for once and for all. Smear 1: We were told that Ken is on the far left and once supported the IRA. The Plain Truth: Ken is an extremist only in his commitment to the well being of the people of this great city. He rarely, if ever, thinks about \"politics\", and believes terrorism should be practised only when strictly necessary. Smear 2: We were told that Ken is a political opportunist, who will say whatever people want to hear in order to get elected. The Plain Truth: When I voiced these worries to Ken, he placed his hand gently on my shoulder, looked me straight in the eye and assured me personally that it wasn't true. Smear 3: We were told that, way back in the 1980s, Ken once had a moustache. The Plain Truth: Ken has always been clean-shaven. Photographs of him wearing a moustache have been circulating in the media for many years now, but these have been widely discredited by photographic experts as highly skilled M15 forgeries, many of them studio shots of Private Walker, the spiv character in the long-running TV series Dad's Army. Smear 4: We were told that Ken has never been liked by his parliamentary colleagues. The Plain Truth: Ken's popularity in the House of Commons is legendary. The reason they never want to sit anywhere near him is purely because they don't want to seem to be \"sucking up\" to such a charismatic political star. Smear 5: We were told that Ken will use the mayoralty to promote old political cronies. The Plain Truth: Ken has pledged to pick his colleagues from right across the political spectrum. He has already offered his fellow Labour candidates key posts, but Glenda Jackson refused a senior catering position while Frank Dobson snootily refused out of hand the prestigious post of deputy mayor with special responsibility for toilet facilities in underground car parks. Smear 6: We were told that London under Ken Livingstone's GLC wasn't all it has since been cracked up to be. The Plain Truth: Under Ken Livingstone, London in 1980s became a socialist paradise. Thanks to Ken's revolutionary Fares Fair policy. There were no traffic jams whatsoever, smoked salmon \"eats\" were served at peak hours on the underground, and the uncrowded streets were full of goodwill and merriment, neighbours sharing nutritious scraps with one another, while folk of all colours and creeds performed impromptu ballads in praise of their unmoustachioed liberator. But now let's look to the future. Those of us who have stuck with Ken through thick and thin are fully aware what kind of miracles the guy is capable of. By the end of May, for instance, he will have largely sorted out London's current traffic nightmare. Out will go the private cars with their noxious fumes and irate single-person drivers. In will come luxurious door-to-door buses and coaches, all expertly driven by cheerful cockneys, many of them bona fide pearly kings and queens, with a choice of soft drinks, plus delicious freshly made baguettes and a full range of tempting pastries all \"on the house\". Out will go tardy, grubby tube trains. In will come a fully integrated mixed-media underground transport system. Out will go the notorious Circle line, disastrously designed so that the traveller who gets on at, say South Kensington, emerges over an hour later in the very same place. In will come a vivid and hugely exciting new Sur Cool line redesigned by award-winning BritArtist Tracey Emin (widely tipped to be the new deputy mayor), which will transport jaded commuters on a magical mystery tour of light, colour and shade, eventually dropping them at West Acton, within easy reach of a handy connection for the District line. With the happy loss of so much road traffic, many of London's busiest highways will be grassed over and transformed into premium picnic areas, where ordinary, decent Londoners - the best home-cooks in the world, incidentally - will be only too pleased to share their hampers with the homeless and downtrodden. And those are just the plans until June! Hurrah for Ken! He's the guy who'll make us all happy once more! And one thing's for sure: he'll never disappoint us.",

      "bodyText": "Wildlife campaigners yesterday warned that Japan wants to hunt more whale species. The proposal was lodged last month with the Cambridge-based International Whaling Commission by Minoru Morimoto, Japan's IWC commissioner, it has emerged. This draft research plan to extend Japan's \"scientific whaling\" is to be considered at meetings of the IWC in Adelaide, Australia, next month. Although the IWC can be expected to oppose the proposal, Japan looks set to continue regardless. The plan is reported to say that 100 minke whales, 50 Bryde's whales and 10 sperm whales will be killed to investigate their diet. Japan has previously claimed that whales eat huge quantities of fish and therefore threaten commercial fisheries and the stability of marine eco-systems. The West Country based Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society said up until now Japan's \"scientific\" hunt, which is carried out in defiance of a 14-year ban on commercial hunting, has targeted minke whales. This latest development will further anger many countries and outrage environmentalists worldwide. Sue Fisher, WDCS cam paigns manager said: \"It also clearly shows that Japan is in no mood for any compromise on whaling. Scientific whaling provides meat to the Japanese markets and is no more than a thin disguise for a commercial hunt. \"The two larger whale species that Japan now identifies as targets for a spurious scientific study are, in fact, better economic targets for them\". She added: \"Bigger whales yield more meat for much the same effort as smaller ones.\" In 1982 the countries that are parties to the IWC agreed a ban on commercial whaling. Norway and Japan have never abided by this - choosing instead to use legal loopholes to continue their commercial takes. Two weeks ago, at the conference of parties to the Convention in Trade in Endangered Species (Cites), four proposals from Norway and Japan to resume international trade in products from three minke whale and one gray whale population were rejected. The Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society said if the Cites parties had known at the time that Japan also intended to start hunting Bryde's and sperm whales, the opposition would have been even fiercer.",

In a statement after a meeting in London, they accused politicians and some in the media of damaging community relations and giving rise to hostility and fear by attacks on refugees. The bishops were concerned that the debate on asylum in the UK \"is being conducted in a way that is damaging to community relations. In some instances this has given rise to hostility, alarm and fear\". Although insisting their message was not political and that it applied to all politicians as well as national newspapers which have criticised asylum seekers, the bishops' spokesman pointedly singled out expressions used by senior Tories for condemnation. The Tory manifesto for yesterday's local government elections spoke of a flood of bogus asylum seekers, and Ann Widdecombe, shadow home secretary and a leading lay Catholic, has described Britain as becoming a soft touch for a massive influx. The Conservative leadership has repeatedly refused to tone down its language despite condemnation from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the Commission for Racial Equality. Bishop Patrick O'Donoghue suggested that Catholics should consult their bibles and the teaching of the church before deciding whether to vote for candidates promulgating such messages. The bishop, whose diocese covers west London and who was speaking on behalf of his colleagues, said: \"What we are calling for is compassion, understanding, respect, justice and love and all of these are at the heart of the Christian faith. \"It is regrettable that we cannot speak about asylum seekers without using emotive language. You hear again and again about scroungers, bogus, flood, aggressive beggars - awful statements. \"We are greatly concerned about this negative tone which is beginning to provoke hostility, alarm and fear in some communities. \"I am saying to William Hague that he should talk about love, compassion and understanding. Asylum seekers can be scapegoated and I am looking to politicians for leadership at a time of difficulty when we need a great deal of sensitivity to the issues involved. \"This is not simply addressed to William Hague and Ann Widdecombe but also to the government and other politicians and the media.\" In the statement the bishops said: \"[Our] concern stems from the Christian belief that we are bound to do what we can to welcome and help the stranger in need.\" It called on politicians to educate the public about the conditions from which many asylum-seekers had fled. It sought a balanced approach from politicians and the media to ensure asylum seekers were treated with compassion and dignity. Although the statement came too late to affect voting in the elections, it may yet discomfort Mr Hague, who made a play for the Christian vote in the campaign, addressing a conference of Protestant evanglicals and calling for them to become more involved in politics.",

      "bodyText": "Physiotherapists last night voted to lobby for a ban on baby walkers they claim are responsible for injuring thousands of children and hindering development. Delegates at the Chartered Society of Physiotherapists conference in Eastbourne voted overwhelmingly in favour of the move. They intend to work with other health organisations in calling for the popular walkers, used by more than 250,000 babies in the UK, to be outlawed. According to research, the baby walkers are responsible for injuring as many as 4,000 children a year. Children's walking and visual skills are believed to be affected because babies in the walkers cannot explore their surroundings properly or learn how their bodies work. Babies put in the walkers are also thought to be slower to develop mentally. A spokeswoman for the society said: \"There is overwhelming support for this motion. Delegate after delegate was telling the conference how they had seen children's development hindered and delayed by these walkers.\" Lynda Rowe, who proposed the motion, said: \"Parents buy baby walkers because they believe they will keep their children safe and help them to learn to walk. \"Physiotherapists know this is not the case.\" Mothercare, which manufactures some baby walkers, said: \"Mothercare has always emphasised that the environment in which baby walkers are used is fundamental to their safety. \"They should only be used on a smooth surface and for a limited period as they are not a training aid.\"",

If she did not dominate all the stage drawing-rooms of the period, her gracious presence brought dignity and a dry wit to scores of forgotten farces.</p> <p>Is it ill-mannered now to wonder why she seemed so often, and for so long, to have played the same kind of ladylike part? To wonder, in a word, why she never developed into a more powerful actress? The short answer may be that Swinburne's attractive art flourished in an era when drawing-room comedy, however silly, pleased. Audiences could be sure of seeing, without envy or disdain, their social betters leading sometimes lurid lives of graceful and secure splendour, so unlike the lives of most spectators. It was a distraction from reality.</p> <p>So, for the stage-struck daughter of a west country toy manufacturer, who trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and, at 14, got her first West End chance in something called Paddly Pools, the spirit of the age was on her side. When the troops who survived the trenches came home on leave, they crowded those theatres playing revues and musical comedy. By then, the young Elinore Johnson (she soon changed her name) was part of Clive Currie's Young Players learning the ropes.</p> <p>Swinburne would appear in up to three West End plays every season. And even when the demand for floozies and flappers in such trivial-sounding shows as This And That, Yes, It's You I Want, Lovers' Leap, and Married For Money began to dwindle in the 1940s, her theatrical presence was such that no playgoer felt able to miss it. Even the sternest critics said she never bored them, however boring her part.</p> <p>The upshot was two or three more decades on stage, including two stints with the '69 Theatre, Manchester, playing Violet in TS Eliot's The Family Reunion (1973) and Julia Shuttleworth in The Cocktail Party (1975). Then she retired.</p> <p>Meanwhile, since 1919, there had been a less intense career both in silent cinema and the talkies. Her films ranged from Branded (1920) to Up The Chastity Belt (1971). Quarter (1948), drawn from Maugham short stories, was perhaps the best. But Swinburne's heart was always in the theatre. Between the wars, she sailed twice to Broadway; and in 1938 went successfully into management with Peter Blackmore's Lot's Wife, in which she played the title role.</p> <p>In Turgenev's A Month In The Country (1943), Swinburne took over the role of Nathalia Petrovna from Valerie Taylor, and from Diana Wynyard in Lillian Hellman's Watch On The Rhine. Later stage credits included Mrs Arbuthnot in Wilde's A Woman Of No Importance (1953), Peter Coke's Fool's Paradise (1959), in which she co-starred with Cicely Courtneidge, and Donald Howarth's All Good Children (1964). Her television roles included Aunt Hester in the Forsyte Saga (1967).</p> <p>There was a walkover look about much of her acting. But when it looks easy it seldom is. In the name part of Maugham's Caroline (Arts Theatre, 1949), for example, Swinburne played the siren, as Harold Hobson remarked, \"gently and charmingly\". It was a familiar role for her to be \"an object of desire\".</p> <p>Nora Swinburne was thrice married and twice divorced; her first husband was the actor Francis Lister; her second was Edward Ashley-Cooper; and her third was the actor Esmond Knight, who died in 1987.</p> <p>She leaves her son Francis, from her first marriage.</p> <p>Nora Swinburne, actress, born July 24 1902; died May 1 2000</p>",

Is it ill-mannered now to wonder why she seemed so often, and for so long, to have played the same kind of ladylike part? To wonder, in a word, why she never developed into a more powerful actress? The short answer may be that Swinburne's attractive art flourished in an era when drawing-room comedy, however silly, pleased. Audiences could be sure of seeing, without envy or disdain, their social betters leading sometimes lurid lives of graceful and secure splendour, so unlike the lives of most spectators. It was a distraction from reality. So, for the stage-struck daughter of a west country toy manufacturer, who trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and, at 14, got her first West End chance in something called Paddly Pools, the spirit of the age was on her side. When the troops who survived the trenches came home on leave, they crowded those theatres playing revues and musical comedy. By then, the young Elinore Johnson (she soon changed her name) was part of Clive Currie's Young Players learning the ropes. Swinburne would appear in up to three West End plays every season. And even when the demand for floozies and flappers in such trivial-sounding shows as This And That, Yes, It's You I Want, Lovers' Leap, and Married For Money began to dwindle in the 1940s, her theatrical presence was such that no playgoer felt able to miss it. Even the sternest critics said she never bored them, however boring her part. The upshot was two or three more decades on stage, including two stints with the '69 Theatre, Manchester, playing Violet in TS Eliot's The Family Reunion (1973) and Julia Shuttleworth in The Cocktail Party (1975). Then she retired. Meanwhile, since 1919, there had been a less intense career both in silent cinema and the talkies. Her films ranged from Branded (1920) to Up The Chastity Belt (1971). Quarter (1948), drawn from Maugham short stories, was perhaps the best. But Swinburne's heart was always in the theatre. Between the wars, she sailed twice to Broadway; and in 1938 went successfully into management with Peter Blackmore's Lot's Wife, in which she played the title role. In Turgenev's A Month In The Country (1943), Swinburne took over the role of Nathalia Petrovna from Valerie Taylor, and from Diana Wynyard in Lillian Hellman's Watch On The Rhine. Later stage credits included Mrs Arbuthnot in Wilde's A Woman Of No Importance (1953), Peter Coke's Fool's Paradise (1959), in which she co-starred with Cicely Courtneidge, and Donald Howarth's All Good Children (1964). Her television roles included Aunt Hester in the Forsyte Saga (1967). There was a walkover look about much of her acting. But when it looks easy it seldom is. In the name part of Maugham's Caroline (Arts Theatre, 1949), for example, Swinburne played the siren, as Harold Hobson remarked, \"gently and charmingly\". It was a familiar role for her to be \"an object of desire\". Nora Swinburne was thrice married and twice divorced; her first husband was the actor Francis Lister; her second was Edward Ashley-Cooper; and her third was the actor Esmond Knight, who died in 1987. She leaves her son Francis, from her first marriage. Nora Swinburne, actress, born July 24 1902; died May 1 2000",

A Kind Of Hush has been in the main competitions of six European film festivals, received three major prizes and a vastly positive response from critics generally.

They are searching for masonry, including rare carvings, looted from Valle Crucis (Valley of the Cross) abbey near Llangollen since the dissolution of the monasteries in 1536. They also hope to be able to find materials taken during the last 20 years by visitors looking for stylish additions to their homes and patios. The abbey, in the kind of remote setting preferred by Cistercians in their wish to escape the ways of the world, was established in 1200 on land given by a prince of Powys to monks at Strata Marcella in mid-Wales. At its peak there would have been about 15 monks plus lay brothers farming the surrounding fields. But by the time Henry VIII wreaked havoc only about five monks remained. The ruins now lie in pastures and include a west front with a richly carved doorway, rose window, rib-vaulted chapter house and inscription recording that in the 14th century \"Abbot Adams carried out this work; may he rest in peace\". David Crane, secretary of the friends of the abbey, set up to support Cadw, the Welsh heritage agency, said: \"After the dissolution, the abbey became a source of stone. \"It would have gone into houses and garden walls and much of it would be plain stone which would be impossible to identify. \"But other pieces - carved or worked - could be more significant and we would love to see them.
